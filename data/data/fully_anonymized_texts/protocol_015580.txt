Number of Study 
Sites  Approximately 40 sites in the [LOCATION_002]  (US)  will participate  in 
this study.  
Number of Subjects 
Planned The original planned sample size was  280 subjects randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to either the pi[INVESTIGATOR_710053] 
(i.e., 140 subjects in each treatment group).  The study was planned to 
be conducted in the US only. 
In March, 2020, in response to the emerging coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID -19), ACADIA implemented a temporary pause to new 
enrollment into study ACP -103-059, to decrease potential exposure to 
COVID -19, minimize risks  to trial integrity, and to assure the safety of 
already enrolled, ongoing study subjects. The last subject  was 
randomized on 17 March  2020, for a total of 148 randomized subjects. 
ACADIA decided to  combine its two ongoing, Phase III studies, 
ACP -103-059 ( US-based study) and ACP -103-054 (non- US), when 
each were  half enrolled, into one study with a pre -specified statistical

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: [ADDRESS_965483] ration Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg (provided as 2×17 mg tablets) or matching 
placebo (2×placebo tablets [size- and color- matched to pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256]]) . 
It is recommended that the subject should take the study drug at 
approximately the same time each day. Tablets will be administered orally as a single dose once daily.  
Study Design  This study will be conducted as a multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group study in subjects 
experiencing m ajor depressive disorder with inadequate response to a 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) or 
serotonin-norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] ( SNRI ). 
This unmasked protocol version provides details of certain study design elements, procedures, and statistical methods that are intended for use only by [CONTACT_710105].  
The study will have three  periods ( Figure  S–1): 
• Screening period (3-28 days)  
• Double- blind treatment period ( 6 we eks) 
• Safety follow -up period (a t least  30 days) 
Screening Period (3 -28 Days) 
During the screening period, su bjects will be assessed for study 
eligibility and prohibited medications will be discontinued.  
Medications should be discontinued only if it is deem ed clinically 
appropriate to do so and in consultation with the treating physician. Investigators should not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of enrolling them into the study. The screening period may be extended up to [ADDRESS_965484] eligibility when 
discussed  with the Medical Monitor in advance. 
Double -blind Period ( 6 Weeks)  
The Baseline visit (Visit 2) may occur as soon as screening procedures are completed and subject eligibility has been confirmed by [CONTACT_710106] . At Visit 2, subjects will be randomized  in a 
1:1 ratio to pi[INVESTIGATOR_650913] n 34 mg  once daily or matching placebo. 
Assessments will be conducted at Week 0 (Baseline), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and  
6/EOT or e arly termination (ET).

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 8 of 81 Safety Follow -up Period ( 30 Days ) 
Eligible subjects who successfully complete the 6 -week double-blind 
period will be qualified to enroll in an open- label extension study; 
subjects enrolling in the open- label extension study will not enter the 
[ADDRESS_965485] dose of study drug.  
The schedule of assessments is provided in Table  S–1. 
Study  Duration  The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be up to 
15 weeks, consisting of a screening period of up to 5 weeks (i.e., 4 weeks, with possible extension of up to 7 days) , a 6- week 
double-blind treatment period, and a safety follow-up period of at least  
30 days (for those subjects who discontinue prematurely from the study or who do not enroll in the open- label extension study) 
(
Figure  S–1). The study completion date is defined as the date the final 
subject, across all sites, completes their final protocol-defined assessment, which includes the safety follow -up visit /contact , if 
applicable. If the study is terminated for any r eason , subjects 
remaining in the study will return to standard of care.

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol and the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice s (GCP) Guideline.  
1.1 Background Information 
Depression is ranked as the leading cause of disability worldwide b y the World Health 
Organization ( Murray and Lopez 1996). In particular, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a 
psychiatric illness that is characterized by [CONTACT_205505][INVESTIGATOR_1841], along with an absence of any history of manic, mixed, or hypomanic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. It is a serious, often recurrent medical condition, which is associated with a 15.9% lifetime risk of 
suicide attempt ( Chen and Dilsaver 1996). Results of the World Mental Health Survey 
Initiative found that the average lifetime incidence of DSM -4 major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_149494] 
14.6%, with a 12-month prevalence of 5.5% in higher income countries ( Bromet et al. 2011). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_96631] y of numerous pharmacological and psychological treatment options, 
fewer than 50% of all patients with depression show full remission with optimized treatment, 
including courses on numerous medications with and without concurrent psychotherapy (Rush et al. 2006).  
Thus, while medications have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment patients  with an 
inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], there is a clear need for efficacious  
medications with improved tolerability and safety. Current research continues to investigate 
novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of augmentation of antidepressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_710066] a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-stage s equential parallel comparison design (SPCD) (Fava et al. 2016) study in adult 
subjects with MDD and an inadequate response to antidepressant therapy with concurrent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)/serotonin- norepi[INVESTIGATOR_710060] 
(SNRI) (Study ACP -103-042). In the study, [ADDRESS_965515]- line therapy for 
5 weeks  (Stage 1). Those patients who did not show a response to placebo in Stage 1 were 
re-randomized to receive either pi[INVESTIGATOR_710067] a second 5- week treatment 
period (Stage 2).

Scale (HAMD -17) total score compared to placebo (p=0.039). In addition, in Stage 1 (n=207)

a benefit over placebo in the first week of treatment (p=0.0365; effect size [Cohen’ s d] 
0.346). Fewer subjects (n=58) than anticipated proceeded to Stage 2, and no treatment benefit 
versus placebo was observed in this small set of placebo non-responders. In summary, pi[INVESTIGATOR_710070] 1 and Stage 2 and demonstrated a highly significant improvement over placebo in 
HAMD-17 in Stage 1.

rates (p=0.0065), defined as a 50% or greater reduction on the HAMD-[ADDRESS_965516] frequently 
reported treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) included headache in the placebo group 
and headache, dry mouth, and nausea in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_387351]. In Stage 1, for placebo subjects, TEAEs leading to discontinuation included depression, swelling face, and 
hypotension; for pi[INVESTIGATOR_710073], a TEAE of vomiting was reported and led to discontinuation. In Stage 2, a TEAE of diabetes mellitus was reported in the placebo group 
and led to discontinuation. One subject in each of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_710074] (SAEs). The placebo subject experienced SAEs of prostate cancer and calculus bladder; the pi[INVESTIGATOR_710075]. These SAEs were deemed not to be related to the study drug by [CONTACT_710120]. No deaths were reported in the study. 
Furthermore, no meaningful differences were observed between the pi[INVESTIGATOR_710076], the Simpson Angus Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Weight changes and ECG changes between the

in elderly patients with dementia ( Wang et al. 2005 ). On the basis of its novel receptor

disease agitation and aggression, dementia -related psychosis , and schizophrenia are ongoing. 
A more complete discussion of these studies is available in the current pi[INVESTIGATOR_387347]’s brochure. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_710079] . In single and multiple dose studies in healthy subjects , the highest doses administered 
were 255  mg and 136 mg /day, respectively. In Phase [ADDRESS_965520] common TEAEs (>3%) were 
postural dizziness (7.7%), headache (6.9%), somnolence (4.6%), nausea (3.8%), and 
dizziness (3.1%) in the single-dose studies (N=130) and headache (15.1%), dizziness (8.6%), 
nausea (7 .4%), somnolence (5.1%), and postural dizziness (3.7%) in the multiple-dose 
studies (N=350). Nausea and vomiting were considered dose- limiting. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_710080]

(6.9% pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg vs. 4.3% placebo), peripheral edema (6.9% pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg 
vs. 2.2% placebo), fall (6.4% pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg vs. 9.1% placebo), and confusional state 
(5.9% pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg vs. 2.6% placebo). In the long-term open-label studies in subjects with PDP  (as of 28 April 2019), the most frequent TEAEs include fall ( 31.1%), urinary tract 
infection (1 9.1%), hallucination (14.5%), decreased weight (1 3.3%), confusional state 
(11.4%), and constipation (11.2%). It is difficult to interpret these in cidence rates in the 
absence of a concurrent control group. The overall incidence of TEAEs appears within what would be expected in subjects with the underlying neurodegenerative disease, psychosis, and advanced age.  
As of [ADDRESS_965523] d ied during participation  in the PDP studies , with the 
majority of deaths considered not related or unlikely related to study drug. Five of these deaths occurred in 6 -week double -blind studies ([ADDRESS_965524] received 8.5 mg 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_710081], and 3 subjects received  34 mg pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256]), and 69 deaths occurred in the 
multi- year, long -term open- label extension studies.  
Medical reviews of all deaths occurring in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_710082], including placebo -controlled (6-week) and open- label (long -term) studies, found no common etiology 
or unifying pathology to attribute these deaths to pi[INVESTIGATOR_710083]. The causes of death 
(e.g., cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], infection) were consistent with the advanced age, stage of 
illness, and comor bidities of this elderly, medically frail population. Additional information is 
provided in the current pi[INVESTIGATOR_387347]’ s brochure. 
In a frail, elderly population of 181 nursing home patients with ADP (90 treated with pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256]; 91 with placebo), pi[INVESTIGATOR_710084], with no new safety observations. There were [ADDRESS_965525]-randomization deaths, 4 (4.4%) in each treatment group. More subjects had SAEs with pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] (15 subjects, 16.7%) than with placebo 
(10 subjects, 11.0%), but there were fewer discontinuations due to AEs with pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 
(8 subjects, 8.9%) than with placebo (11 subjects, 12.1%). TEAEs reported in ≥10% of 
subjects in either group were (pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256]; placebo) fall (23.3%; 23.1%), urinary tract 
infection (22.2%; 27.5%), agitation (21.1%; 14.3%), lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (14.4%; 
13.2%), contusion (12.2%; 15.4%), aggression (10.0%; 4.4%), anemia (10.0%; 8.8%), blood 
lactate dehydrogenase decreased (4.4%; 11.0%), and hyperglycemia (4.4%; 12.1%). Mean weight change from Baseline to Day 85 was comparable for the two treatment groups. Weight loss ≥7% was more common with pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256], 14.6%; placebo, 
1.8%). Treatment with pi[INVESTIGATOR_710085].

1.5 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
This study will examine a range of symptoms to explore the efficacy and safety  of adjunctive 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_710087].  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256], with its potent activity as a [ADDRESS_965533]/inverse agonist and lesser 
activity as a [ADDRESS_965534]/inverse agonist, has a receptor profile similar to that of many 
compounds with antidepressant activity.  In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Phase 2 study (ACP-103-042) exploring adjunctive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256], adult MDD patients with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy showed improvements in  measures of 
depression, disability , clinical global impression , sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and sexual functioning, as 
summarized in Section 1.1.  
Clinical studies conducted in a range of patient populations (approximately 2720 exposed 
subjects, including patients w ith PDP, ADP, Alzheimer ’s disease agitation and aggression, 
schizophrenia, and MDD, as well as healthy subjects) have shown that pi[INVESTIGATOR_710088]. In the Phase 2 study (ACP -103-042) no new safety signals were observed in the MDD patient population that 
were not already described in the approved NUPLAZID
® prescribing information 
(ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. 2019).  
On the basis of nonclinical and clinical data, it is therefore believed that pi[INVESTIGATOR_710089] , with an acceptable safety profile.

monitor the safety and well-being of the study subject, in accordance to study protocol. 
3.3.1 Combination of Databases of Studies -059 and -054 
At the time screening  was paused , approximately half of the planned subjects had been 
randomized in each study. ACADIA decided to combine the two studies, ACP-103-059 and 
ACP-103-054, into one study with a pre- specified statistical analysis plan. As a result, both 
studies closed and are proceeding with database lock and statistical analysis. No new patients 
were enrolled into these studies. The modifications to the s tatistica l handling of the study are 
described briefly in Section 9 and in detail in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

return all packaging and unused study drug to the Investigator at regularly scheduled clinic 
visits and ET visits. Any  study drug supplied is for use in this study only and should not be 
used for any other purpose. 
At appropriate intervals during the study, study drug reconciliation will be per formed by [CONTACT_429] (or designee) who may return appropriate unused study drug and used and unused 
packaging to the Sponsor’ s designee for destruction.  
At the conclusion of the study, final study drug reconciliation will be conducted at the site. Final s tudy drug accountability documentation will be maintained at both the site and at the 
Sponsor. Any remaining unused study drug and all used and unused packaging will be sent 
back to the Sponsor’s designee for destruction, as allowed by [CONTACT_387417]. Documentation of study drug destruction will be recorded and maintained by [CONTACT_387418]’ s designee.  
6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Study specific procedures are detailed below. All assessments will be completed according to the schedule described in  Table  S–1. Every effort should be made to complete the required 
procedures and evaluations at the designated visits and times.  
6.[ADDRESS_965567] eligibility will be assessed during the Screening period by [CONTACT_710121]. The Screening period (between the Screening and 
Baseline visit) may  be extended by [CONTACT_8622] [ADDRESS_965568]. Demographic information, including date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity 
(if al lowed by [CONTACT_427]) will be recorded as well. Any new medical condition 
beginning after the ICF has been signed will be captured as an AE. In addition, a history of 
the medications that the subject has taken for the current depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_710095]: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: [ADDRESS_965569] ’s psychiatric history and treatment will be collected.  
6.1.3 Background Antidepressant Blood Level  
At Screening, blood samples for the analysis of the concomitant selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor (SSRI)/serotonin-norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] (SNRI) antidepressants will be collected. At Screening, the presence of SSRI or SNRI must be confirmed in order to qualify 
the subject for further consideration in the study. Review of subject adherence with 
background antidepressant therapy should be conducted at screening visit and all visits.  
6.1.4 [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_710096] ( Fava and Davidson 1996; Fava 2003) is a clinician -assisted questionnaire 
that examines a patient ’s antidepressant treatment history using specific anchor points to 
define the adequacy of both the dose and duration of each antidepressant course, as well as 
the degree of symptomatic improvement obtained with each course. This validated questionnaire allows for the determination of inadequate response to antidepressant therapy in MDD ( Chandler et al. 2010). Inadequate response is d efined as a response of <50% to a 
course of treatment of at least 8 weeks at the minimum effective dose (as listed on the ATRQ), which has been stable for the 4 weeks prior to the SAFER interview.  
6.1.5 State versus trait, Assessability, Face validity, Ecological validity, and Rule of 
three Ps (pervasive, persistent, and pathological) (SAFER) Remote Interview  
To ensure that appropriate subjects are entered into the study, an interview will be conducted 
. 
The interview may be conducted via telephone off-site or on-site, during Screening. If 
conducted on-site, the site staff should not be present during the interview. The assessments administered will be the SAFER Interview, which will include the MADRS, the CGI -S, and 
the MGH ATRQ. Sites will be notified of the results within [ADDRESS_965570] range of ma jor 
psychiatric disorders in DSM -5 and ICD-10 ( Sheehan et al. 1998). The MINI is divided into 
modules, with each module corresponding to a diagnostic category. After completing the 
questions in each module, t he interviewer (i.e., the Investigator or designee) assesses whether 
the diagnostic criteria are met.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 48 of 81 In addition, one module for depressive disorders from the MINI-Plus will be used in 
conjunction with the MINI. The MINI-Plus is a more extensive version of the MINI, 
inclu ding additional disorders and disorder subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (Sheehan et al. 1998). 
MINI Version 7.0.2 for DSM-5 will be used in this study and will be conducted during Screening.  
6.1.7 Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale 
The MADRS ( Montgomery and Asberg 1979) is a 10 -item, clinician -rated instrument 
measuring depression severity. It will be administered  during Screening and at Baseline by 
[CONTACT_710129] a Structured I nterview Guide for the Montgomery- Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale (SIGMA) ( Williams and Kobak 2008) . The timeframe for this scale 
is the past 7 days. 
6.2 Efficacy Assessments  
6.2.1 Hamilton  Depression  Scale (17 Items)  
The HAMD-17 ( Hamilton 1960) is completed with the Structured Interview Guide for the 
Hamilton Depr ession Rating Scale (SIGH -D) (Williams 1988 ) by [CONTACT_710130] a patient ’s symptoms . The timeframe for this scale is the past 
[ADDRESS_965571] scale completed at each v isit. The HAMD -17 will be 
used as the primary efficacy analysis.  
The anxiety/somatization factor  of the HAMD -17 ( Cleary and Guy  1977) includes six items: 
psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, general somatic 
symptoms, hypochondriasis, and insight, and will be used for secondary efficacy analyses.  
6.2.2 Sheehan Disability Scale  
The SDS ( Sheehan et al. 1996) is a three -item patient-facing questionnaire used to evaluate 
impairments in the domains of work, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibility. 
All items are rated on an 11 -point continuum (0=no impairment to 10=most severe). The 
timeframe for this scale is the past week . The SDS will be used for secondary efficacy 
analyses.  
6.2.3 Clinical Global Impression –Severity and Clinical Global Impression –
Improvement Scales  
The CGI -S and CGI- I (Guy 1976) are scales used by [CONTACT_710131]. The CGI- S 
rates the severity of a patient ’s depression over the past 7 days and will be completed with a 
structured interview guide for global impressions (SIGGI) ( Targum et al. 2013). The CGI -S 
will be used for secondary efficacy analyses. The CGI -I rates the change in a patient ’s 
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: [ADDRESS_965572] 7 days relative to the patient’ s symptoms at Baseline  and will be 
used for secondary efficacy analyses.  
6.2.4 Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire Short Form  
Sexual functioning will be assessed using the CSFQ -14 ( Keller et al. 2006) , a 14 -item version 
of the CSFQ ( Clayton et al. 1997) . This is a patient-facing questionnaire, with a male version 
and a female version,  that provides scores for three scales corresponding to the phases of the 
sexual response cycle (i.e. , desire, arousal, and orgasm) and the five scales of the original 
CSFQ (sexual desire, sexual frequency, sexual satisfaction, sexual arousal, and sexual 
completion). The CSFQ -14 will be used for secondary efficacy analyses.  
6.2.5 Karolinska Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_127162] (Akerstedt and Gill berg 1990 ) is a patient -facing scale that measures the patient ’s 
drowsiness and is frequently used in studies measuring subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. Scoring is 
based on a 9-point verbally anchored scale ranging from “ extremely alert” to “very sleepy, 
great effort to keep awak e, fighting sleep. ” The timeframe for this scale is the past 7 days.  
The KSS will be used for secondary efficacy analyses.  
6.2.6 Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 
The BIS -11 (Patton et al. 1995) is a questionnaire designed to asse ss the 
personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness. It is composed of 30 items describing 
common impulsive or non-impulsive (for reverse scored items) behaviors and preferences. Items are scored on the following 4- point scale: Rarely/Never=1; Occasionally=2; Often=3; 
Almost Always/Always=4.  The BIS -[ADDRESS_965573] visited subjects in their homes .  
6.3 Safety Assessments 
6.3.1 Physical Examinations 
A general physical examination will be conducted  at Screening, Baseline, and Week 6/ET .

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 50 of 81 6.3.3 Height , Weight, and Body Mass Index  
Height will be measured at Screening . 
Weight will be measured at all scheduled and unscheduled visits. 
Body m ass index will be calculated using the following formula: 
Weight (kg) / [height (m)]2. 
6.3.4 Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be complete, standardized recordings. At Visit 1 (Screening), the ECG 
should be completed in triplicate and collected within a 3-minute period. At all other visits, a 
single 12- lead ECG should be completed. All ECGs will be centrally read; the interpretation 
by [CONTACT_710132] . 
At Visit 1 (Screening) the mean QTcF/QRS values of all the tracings of adequate quality will 
be used to determine eligibility. If a site performs additional ECGs beyond the set of triplicate 
ECGs prescribed at Screening or the single ECG prescribed at Baseline, the mean QTcF/QRS 
values of all the tracings of adequate quality will be used to dete rmine eligibility.  
• At Screening, if the set of triplicate ECGs has a prolonged QTcF due to an identifiable 
cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, a repeat set of triplicate ECGs may be performed during Screening at the discretion of the Medical Monitor if 
time permits during the Screening period.  
• At Baseline, a subject who met the eligibility criteria during the central read  of the 
screening ECGs may be enrolled based on the machine read of the locally completed ECG. If the interpreta tion of the ECG by [CONTACT_710133], the subject will be discontinued from the study, but this will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
Electrocardiograms should be performed before blood sampling or at least [ADDRESS_965575] in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] 5 minutes before the ECG is 
obtained. ECG tracings (paper or electronic) will be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified 
clinician. ECG tracings and results (ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF, and QTcB intervals) will be included and summarized in the subject’ s study records.  
6.3.5 Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
determine risk ( Posner et al. 2011). The following four constructs are measured: the severity 
of ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality. 
The Baseline/Screening version will be administered at V isit 1 (Screening), and the Since 
Last Visit version will be administered at all subsequent visits, including unscheduled visits. 
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: [ADDRESS_965576]  and implement appropriate treatment ( Section  4.4).  
6.3.6 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale–Abbreviated  
The ESRS ( Chouinard and Margolese 2005 ) was developed to assess drug induced 
movement disorders such as parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and tardive dyskinesia with established reliability, validity, and sensitivity. It consists of a questionnaire of parkinsonian symptoms, physician examination of parkinsonism, dyskinetic movements, and global impression of tardive dyskinesia. The ESRS-A, an accepted modified form of the original 
ESRS, will be used during the study to monitor for any worsening in extrapyramidal symptoms or signs at scheduled and unscheduled visits.  
6.3.7 Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory sample collection (including HbA
1c at Screening only) is encouraged, but 
not required to be completed under fasting conditions. The laboratory evaluations will 
include, but are not limited to, the following:

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: [ADDRESS_965581] not being able to come to the clinic. Modifications and accommodations for safety assessments in the context of remote visits are described briefly below:  
[IP_ADDRESS] Priority Medical Ass essments in Remote Visits 
The C -SSRS was to be performed as a priority, along with an assessment of AEs and 
COVID -19 symptoms. Additionally, subjects were to be queried about concomitant 
medications, and their background antidepressant and IP compliance. [IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examinations, Vital Signs, Height, and Weight 
Physical examinations, vitals, height, and weight may not have been performed because the 
visit had to be conducted remotely. I f the visit was  remote, subject may have  report ed vitals 
obtained on home devices.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms  
ECGs may have been performed by [CONTACT_320376] a home visit.

See Section [IP_ADDRESS] above.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale- Abbreviated  
When the ESRS-A motor examination could not be performed (e.g., when the visit was  
performed via telephone with no video component) then no scoring of symptoms was to  be 
completed . The clinical interview questions were to be asked for all symptom areas in ord er 
to obtain information about the presence and severity of involuntary movements experienced 
by [CONTACT_710136]. The clinical significance of any symptoms was  to be evaluated by [CONTACT_710137].

7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “ any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study 
participant, temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to study drug ”. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g.,  off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  
AEs do not include the following: 
• Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that are 
present prior to Baseline and do not worsen during the study 
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 56 of 81 • Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at 
Baseline.  
• Overdose of concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the subject 
is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120004] (situation where an untoward medica l occurrence has not occurred)  
• Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a pregnancy form  
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by [CONTACT_5256] “ serious” 
or “not serious.” The seriousness of an event will be  defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of the following: 
• Is fatal 
• Is immediately life threatening  
• Resu lts in disability or permanent damage  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring) 
• Is medically significant  
Definition of Life Threatening  
A life -threatening event places the subject  at immediate  risk of death from the event as it 
occurred . This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508827] a full admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_387385] . This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
 
Examples of visits to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508828]: 
• Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] ) 
• Outp atient surgery  
Study: ACP -103-059  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 57 of 81 • Preplanned or elective procedures  
• Protocol procedures 
• Social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], defined as admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1315] a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject ’s primary residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage 
Disability is defined as a  persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149693], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_456004]. 
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or M edical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.2.1 Severity of Event 
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported in detail as indicated 
on the eCRF: 
• Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities  
• Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
• Severe: incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities  
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_5256] “ related” or 
“not related.” An event is considered related  if there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_95107] (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation). 
Consider t he following when assessing causality: 
• Temporal associations between the agent and the event

• Compat ibility with known class effect  
• Known effects of concomitant medications 
• Pre-existing risk factors  
• A pla usible mechanism  
• Concurrent illnesses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration 
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the following criteria: 
• Start : Date of the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_149688]  
• Stop: Date when AE either ceased permanently or changed in severity  
[IP_ADDRESS] Frequency  
The frequency of the AE should be indicated according to the following definitions: 
• Single : Experienced once, without recurrence  
• Recurrent : More than one discrete epi[INVESTIGATOR_431802]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Action Taken wi th Study Drug  
• Dose not changed : No change in study drug  
• Drug interrupted : Study drug temporarily  stopped 
• Drug withdrawn: Study drug discontinued permanently  
[IP_ADDRESS] Therapy  
• None : No new treatment instituted  
• Medication : New treatment initiated  as a direct result of  AE 
• Other: Other action required  
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome  
• Recovered/resolved : Recovered or resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae: Recovered  or resolved with sequelae  
• Not recovered/not resolved : Not recovered or not resolved 
• Fatal : Death due to an AE  
• Unknown: Unknown

chronic baseline has been established. 
7.[ADDRESS_965586] a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed anything 
different since your last visit? ”) to assess whether any AEs have been  experienced since the 
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on both the AE and the concomitant medication  page.  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology. Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_3786]. 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by [CONTACT_149724] 
(e.g.,  “cold” or “ seasonal allergies” instead of “runny nose ”). 
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug, must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s notes.

No prospective entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed ; all subjects must me et all 
eligibility criteria in order to participate in the study . 
Protocol waivers for eligibility will not be granted by [CONTACT_387435]. 
If, during the course of a subject’ s post-randomization participation in the trial it is 
discovered that the subject did not meet all eligibility criteria, this will be reported as a major 
protocol deviation and not a waiver. In this situation, the subject will be discontinued, unless 
the discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk. The justification to allow the 
subject to continue in the trial will be made by [CONTACT_1034], with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. All follow -up safety assessments must be completed 
and documented as outlined in the protocol ( Section  6.4). The Investigator must report any 
protocol deviation to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance with local regulations, within reasonable time.  
Protocol deviations will be reviewed periodically over the course of the study. The review 
process, definition of the deviation categories, and the classification of a deviation as major or minor are detailed in the Protocol Deviation Management Plan. Protocol deviations will also be assessed with respect to relationship to COVID-19, and COVID -19 related protocol 
deviations will be tabulated.  
10.7 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by [CONTACT_1034] (with or without consultation with 
the Investigator) . All protocol modifications must be submitted to the site IRB /EC in 
accordance with local requirements and, if required, to regulatory authorities , as either an 
amendment or a notification . Approval for amendments must be awaited before any changes 
can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate h azard to trial 
subjects, or when the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. 
No approval is required for notifications. 
11 QUALITY MANA GEMENT 
11.1 Risk Management  
The Sponsor utilizes the ICH E6 (GCP) Revision 2 risk management appr oach that includes 
methods to assure and control the quality of the trial proportionate to the risks inherent in the 
trial and the importance of the information collected. The intent is that all aspects of this trial are operationally feasible and that any  unnecessary complexity, procedures, and data 
collection are avoided. The Sponsor’s risk management approach includes the following 
activities with a focus on critical processes and critical study data:

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3 UNMASKED VERSION Date: 21 June 2020  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 68 of 81 • Risk Identification: risks to critical trial process es, governing systems, investigational 
product, trial design, data collection, and recording are identified.  
• Risk Evaluation: identified risks are evaluated by [CONTACT_387436]: 
(a) likelihood of occurrence, (b) impact on human subject protection and data integrity, 
and (c) detectability of errors.  
• Risk Control: risks that can be reduced (e.g., mitigating) or can be accepted are differentiated. Risk mitigation activities are incorporated in protocol design and 
implementation, study plans, training, processes, and other documents governing the 
oversight and execution of study activities. Where possible, predefined quality 
tolerance limits are to be defined to identify systematic issues that can impact subject safety or data integrity and devi ations from the predefined quality tolerance limits will 
trigger an evaluation and possibly an action. Contingency plans are developed for issues with a high risk factor that cannot be avoided. 
• Periodic risk review, communication, and escalation of risk ma nagement activities are 
ongoing during trial execution and risk outcomes are reported in the clinical study report (CSR).  
11.[ADDRESS_965607], inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that 
subject confidentiality is respected.  Some remote monitoring of study sites was also 
performed  as a result of the travel and visiting restrictions caused by [CONTACT_25963] -19 
pandemic.  
The Sponsor’s or designee’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, 
and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records needed to verify the entries on  the eCRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH guidance on GCP and the Sponsor’ s audit plans, a certain percentage 
of sites participating in this study will be audited. These audits may include a review  of site 
facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related 
records may occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance w ith the protocol, 
ICH guidance on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.

a The effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration -, dose -, and preparation -
dependent. Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor ” when a certain 
preparation was used (e.g., high dose, double strength) or as a “ moderate CYP3A inhibitor ” when another 
preparation was used (e.g., low dose, single strength). (FDA Drug Development and Drug Interactions http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteracti onsLabelin

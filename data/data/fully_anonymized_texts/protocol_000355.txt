Introduction  
 
Study Purpose  
This is an investigator -initiated prospective, single- center, randomized, double-
blind paralleled controlled clinical trial comparing adaptive cardiac resynchronization 
therapy (aCRT)
[ADDRESS_333430] CRT in patients with currently approved (class I -II) 
indications for CRT2. The purpose of this study is two- fold: First, to determine if aCRT is 
superior  as compared to standard CRT, as evidenced by a superior  degree of reduction 
of electrical dyssynchrony index 6-month post -CRT. An Intra -LV electrical dyssynchrony 
index will be computed  from the electrocardiographic  imaging (ECGi) LV epi[INVESTIGATOR_272759]; Second, to determine if a surface ECG metric sum absolute QRST integral (SA I QRST) is a superior  estimate of an intra- LV dyssynchrony, as compared to 
an averaged across 12 -lead QRS duration.

 Confidential   All study participants will receive the commercially available Viva ™ XT CRT -D 
Model DTBA1D4, DTBA1D1, Viva™ Quad XT CRT -D Model DTBA1Q 1, DTBA1QQ, 
Viva™ Quad S  CRT-D Model DTBB1Q1, DTBB1QQ , Viva™ S CRT-D Model 
DTBB1D1, DTBB1D4  or Viva™ XT CRT -P Model C6TR01. All the above model s with 
the exception of the Viva™ Quad S and Viva ™ S CRT devices  have aCRT available27-
31. All CRT-D devices (Models DTBA1D4, DTBA1D1 , DTBA1Q1 , DTBA1QQ , DTBB1D1, 
and DTBB1D4, DTBB1Q1, DTBB1QQ) detect ventricular tachyarrhythmias and can 
provide treatment  in order to resynchronize the pacing of the left and right ventricles and 
can provide full d efibrillation  in the case of ventricular  fibrillation . These models have the 
same indications and contraindications. The CRT -P device (Model C6TR01) similarly 
detects ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but only responds with resy nchronization pacing 
therapy , not defibrillation . CRT-D and CRT -P models are both indicated in patients with 
heart failure according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria set forth by [CONTACT_3181]. 
Choice of model is made on a case- by-case basis depending on patient symptoms that 
would increase likelihood of need for defibrillation. The model and lead type used will be 
at the discretion of the physician implanting the device.  All patients will be randomized 
to one of two pacing therapy arms,  aCRT ON or aCRT OFF.  
The outcome of this study is expected to support use of SAI QRST as an 
estimate of an intra- LV electrical dyssynchrony, and to improve our understanding of the 
mechanisms behind aCRT effect.  
Hypothesis  
We hypothesize  that (1) aCRT is superior  as compared to standard CRT, as 
evidenced by a superior  degree of reduction of electrical dyssynchrony index 6- month 
post-CRT; and (2) a surface ECG metric SAI QRST3-5 is a superior  estimate of an intra-
LV dyssynchrony, as compared  to an averaged acr oss 12- lead QRS duration. 
Study Scope  
Study will be conducted at the Oregon H ealth & Science University . It is a p rospective, 
single -center, randomized, double- blind paralleled controlled clinical trial . As estimated, 
32 participants will be enrolled. All study participants will get commercially available 
Viva™ XT CRT -D device . Participants will be randomized  1:1 to one of two pacing 
therapy arms, aCRT ON or aCRT OFF  (traditional BiV CRT) . Patients who are  receiving 
CRT device without available adaptive CRT  feature (i.e. it is impossible to program 
adaptive software feature ON or OFF) per their clinical team (post -screening)  will be 
placed into a third, non -randomized, non- blinded CRT registry arm . Study participants 
will undergo cardiac MRI and ECGi before device implantation. A second ECGi will be 
performed within two weeks  hours after CRT implantation. Duration of assigned 
intervention is [ADDRESS_333431] CRT (within 30- day interval) participants 
will undergo a 3rd ECGi and echocardiogram. There are 2 primary outcomes  in this 
study: (1) regression slope of Electrical Dyssynchrony Index values measured by [CONTACT_90660] i 
[ADDRESS_333432] Electrical Dyssynchrony Index values measured 
by [CONTACT_90660] i prior CRT ; (2) difference in regression slopes of SAI QRST against Electrical 
Dyssynchrony Index values measured by [CONTACT_272773]. QRS duration against Electrical 
Dyssynchrony Index (EDI) values measured by [CONTACT_272774] .

 Confidential  Background and Justification  
Cardiac resynchronization therapy prolongs life and decreases r isk of heart failure 
exacerbation in patients with low ejection fraction (EF) and wide QRS.6-9  Aging 
population with high prevalence of obesity, diabetes and hypertension, along with 
advancements in the treatment of acute cardiovascular diseases resulted in an increase 
in the incidence and prevalence of the heart failure (HF) over the past decades. Studies 
estimate that about 2- 3% of the population suffer from HF. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_272760], HF carri es substantial morbidity and mortality, and high rates of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272761]- care 
system. CRT is an effective treatment for patients with HF, wide QRS, and reduced EF. 
However, about 30% of CRT r ecipi[INVESTIGATOR_272762].  
QRS duration and LBBB serve as criteria for favorable response to CRT . QRS 
duration served as a main ECG criterion for assessment of electrical dyssynchrony. 
However, QRS duration has limitations and better measure of electrical dyssynchrony is 
needed. Approach to patients with QRS 120- 150 ms is unclear. We recently showed in 
blinded analysis of SMART AV study  (Tereshchenko et al, abstract presented at HRS 
2014) that a novel measure of electrical dys synchrony, sum absolute QRST integral 
(SAI), better predicts CRT response than QRS duration alone. Patients with the high 
mean SAI (3rd tertile) have 2.5 times greater odds of response than those with low mean 
SAI (1st tertile), and 2.0 times greater than the lower two tertiles combined. Trend 
towards the interaction between SAI and left BBB was observed (P=0.08). The effect size was stronger in the non- LBBB patients. Thus, high SAI QRST was strongly 
independently (beyond QRS duration) associated with CRT r esponse in the SMART -AV 
study. However, association of SAI QRST  with a gold standard of LV electrical 
dydssynchrony (ECGi EDI) has  not been tested in a prospective study , and SAI QRST 
was not compared with QRS duration .  
Adaptive CRT is a device -based algorithm that regularly measures  the intrinsic 
conduction intervals that result in continuous  optimization of AV and VV delays , and 
promote synchronized LV pacing
1, 10. Synchronized LV pacing is a CRT pacing 
configurat ion that  times the LV pacing with intrinsic RV conduction11, 12. It is known that 
the RV pacing, alone or during BiV pacing, in patients with LV systolic dysfunction worsens LV and RV performance
13. As was previously reported in GREATER -EARTH 
study, there was 17% improvement of CRT response by [CONTACT_272775]-
responders to LV pacing14. Randomized aCRT clinical trial showed that aCRT improves  
the LV performance and clinical CRT response, and demonstrated superior ity of aCRT 
as compared to echo- optimized BiV pacing1. Subsequent analysis of aCRT trial showed 
that a  higher percentage of synchronized LV  pacing in the aCRT trial was associated 
with a decreased risk of mortality and HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]12, with Kaplan -Meier curves 
starting separation after first [ADDRESS_333433], is not very well 
defined. The foll owing knowledge gaps remain and will be addressed in the proposed 
study.  
Version 6 Electrical dyssynchrony measures: Adaptive CRT effect  (ELDYSME aCRT)  
 Page [ADDRESS_333434]-hoc analysis of aCRT trial12 showed superiority of aCRT in a subgroup of 
patients with normal intrinsic AV interval at randomization, def ined by [CONTACT_272776] (RA) activation to the right ventricular (RV) intrinsic 
activation ≤ 200ms if in sinus rhythm or ≤ [ADDRESS_333435] correlate to RA -RV activation time on 
surface ECG is unknown. It is unknown if PR interval on the surface ECG (or another surface ECG parameter) could predict the response to aCRT, as compared to response on traditional BiV CRT. At the same time, presence of an interaction 
between PR interval and CRT was shown by [CONTACT_272777]. Recent post -hoc 
analysis of MADIT -CRT
15 showed that patients with a long PR  interval (and non-
LBBB) obtained the largest benefit from BiV CRT, whereas patients with normal PR interval (and non- LBBB) did not respond on BiV CRT. This data confirms presence 
of an interaction of CRT with PR interval. Mechanisms behind such an interac tion 
are not entirely clear, and will be addressed by [CONTACT_272778].  
2. Few conducted observational ECGi studies
16, [ADDRESS_333436] of aCRT on electrical dyssynchrony substrate, 
characterized by [CONTACT_272774] . 
3. aCRT trial was conducted in patients who underwent echo- optimization of AV delay. 
However, echo- optimization of AV delay is not routinely used in clinical practice
18. 
SMART -AV study19 did not show difference in outcomes of echo- optimized and fixed 
AV delay (120 ms). Proposed study will compare nominal programming without AV optimization to aCRT.

a superior  estimate of an intra- LV dyssynchrony, as compared to QRS duration. 
Outcome measured : Regression slope of SAI QRST against EDI value and 
regression slope of  QRS duration against EDI value  
 
Secondary Objective(s)  
1. To determine if the  interval  between the end of P -wave and the onset of QRS 
complex in lead V1 (PeR V1) is associated  with intracardiac RA-RV activation 
time. Outcome measured:  AVinterval from EGM and PR interval in ECG  
2. To determine if aCRT is associated  with the development  of reverse electrical 
remodeling ( defined as shrinking of non- paced QRS duration above or equal [ADDRESS_333438] -CRT), and development of mechanical response, 
defined as  a decrease in left ventricular end- systolic volume ≥ 15mls after 6 
months of CRT . Outcome measured:  non-paced QRS duration from ECG and 
left ventricular end- systolic volume from echo.

Study Procedures  
 
Informed Consent Proces s 
Study protocol will be revi ewed and approved by [CONTACT_272780]. All study participants will sign consent form before entering 
the study. We  will request IRB to give us permission (via a Prep to Research f orm) to 
review medical records of study  candidates for inclusion/exclusion criteria. This 
information will not be recorded.  The research study coordinator will screen the OHSU 
Arrhythmia and Heart Rhythm Clinic schedule through Epic for patients who may be 
candidates for CRT and will contact [CONTACT_272781] a 
candidate. Patients, who have approved class I -II indications for CRT -D or CRT -P 
according to current guidelines, who are scheduled for Medtronic CRT -D or CRT -P 
device impla ntation will be approached in the clinic at the time of scheduling for CRT 
implantation.  At this point the study and informed consent form will  be explained to the 
patients. These patients who are will ing and able to sign the consent form will be invited 
to participate in the study and a baseline enrollment visit will be scheduled.  Final 
determination of eligibility will be made  during the initial visit and scheduled baseline 
study visit. After sign ing consent form eligible study  candidate will become stud y 
participant.  
 
Randomization 
Assignment of patients into aCRT on or off will occur through the randomization module 
in REDCap.  Only the study coordinator  and primary investigator  will have access to 
view patient treatment assignments on the REDCap database.  The following information outlines the randomization module implemented via REDCap.   
 The unit of randomization: a person (study participant).  
The type of randomization: random stratified block  
 Assignment ratio: 1:1  
 Assignment strata: (1) gender ( male vs female); (2) cardiomyopathy type 
(ischemic vs. non -ischemic).  
 Block size: random (2, 4, or 6) with allocation proportional to the elements of 
Pascal’s triangle.  
Random seed used and the randomization list were created using the – ralloc - program 
in Stata version 13.1  
 Randomization will be enacted via an envelope- based system, via sealed envelopes 
containing randomization assignments.  Random treatment assignments will be placed 
in advance in a set of sealed envelopes. Each envelope  will be numbered (#1 -32),

[CONTACT_272798] a second staff member and both sign the envelope . Then the envelope is 
opened,  and the treatment group contained therein assigned to the participant and 
recorded on a log.  
 Study participants who , because of clinical reasons per clinical team decision , will 
receive a CRT device without  the adaptive  software feature  enabled will NOT be 
randomized, but instead, will be included in the study registry arm.

Blinding, or Masking  
In order to minimize the introduction of bias, this study will be double- blinded (double-
mask) . Patients  will not have access to their randomization assignment. To o btain non-
biased information and perform non- biased assessments, physicians and their staff who 
will evaluate NYHA classification and heart failure stage, and administer the Minnesota 
Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, and Patient Global Assessment t ools will be 
masked to the patient’s assignment and device programming.  Un-masked physicians 
and staff will be responsible for randomization, programming the  system, monitoring the 
system performance, and collecting system data for this study.  Study person nel will be 
trained to take special care to ensure that patients do not  inadvertently learn of their 
assignment as a result of communication with their care  provider. A log will be 
maintained to identify staff that will remain blinded to the randomization assignment and 
programming.  
 
Data Collection  
For patients that meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, are enrolled in the study, clinical 
data will be collected for patient history, implant, pre- and post -implant baseline 
evaluation/testing, randomization, protocol -required scheduled follow -up visit, remote 
follow- up visits, system modification and study exit (including death) until study closure 
(5 years).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272764] (including adverse event -related 
emergency  department and urgent  care visits) will be reported until the  patient exits the 
study or study closure.  
 All data will be entered  in the digital secure web- based database (REDCap Consortium 
partner http://www.project- redcap.org/
). 
 Data collection requirements are summarized  in Table  1. 
 Subject Follow -Up Schedule  
 During the first year of the study, first follow -up visit will be made at least 6 months after 
CRT-D implantation (within 30- day range). After the six -month follow -up vi sit, follow- up 
via phone call, REDCap surveys, or data collection from routine clinic visits will be scheduled at [ADDRESS_333443] -CRT implantation.   Follow- up 
after six months will be optional based on patient availability.

ensure placement of body surface ECG electrodes at the same location at [ADDRESS_333454]-CRT visit, as it was at the baseline. We will collaborate with Peter van Dam ( Peacs  
(Arnhem, the Netherlands) and will use his Kinect software. He developed 3D Kinect 
Camera software integrated into CIPS  that localizes the ECG electrodes. He recently 
demonstrated the reproducibility of t he registration of the 3D image with the MRI derived  
torso models, by [CONTACT_272786]. The CIPS software that integrates and 
registers the 3D camera image of the electrodes to the MRI derived torso model is 
reproducible. The 3D camera is critical  for quantitative localization of electrode positions 
for CIPS  to accurately localize the  position of the electrodes to the cardiac anatomy  as 
imaged with a  3D camera. We will use subcontract with Dr. van Dam for the use of his 
software and training.  We will use this approach for recording of ECGi data within two 
weeks after CRT implantation (to test accuracy of leads placement at the time when 
heart has not been remodeled yet post -CRT). We will repeat the same procedure at 6-
month post -CRT.  
 
Simultaneous  Recording of intracardiac EGMs and 12 -lead surface ECG  will be 
performed within two weeks after device implantation, before discharge, and at 6- month

 Confidential  Statistical Methods and Data Analysis  
Primary Outcome: There are 2 primary outcomes  in this study: (1) regression slope of 
Electrical Dyssynchr ony Index values measured by [CONTACT_272774] [ADDRESS_333457] Electrical Dyssynchrony Index values measured by [CONTACT_272788]; 
Only randomized patients (treatment arm adaptive CRT, and control arm regular CRT) will be included in this analysis. (2 ) difference in regression slopes of SAI QRST against 
Electrical Dyssynchrony Index values measured by [CONTACT_272789]. QRS duration against Electrical Dyssynchrony Index (EDI) values measured by [CONTACT_272774].  All study participants 
(randomized two arms, and non- randomize d registry arm) will be included in this 
analysis. 
 Main  analysis: linear regression  
 Predictor s:  
Electrical Dyssynchrony Index
 The electrical dyssynchrony index (ED I) is computed as 
the standard deviation of activation times at 350/[ADDRESS_333458] will be defined, and Log transformation (or other transformation, if required, depending on the particular case) will be performed for any variable that displays non-normal distribution, with subsequent  verification of an achieved normal distribution. 
Simple and multiple linear regression models  will be explored to determine factors that 
may play the role of predictors of our  tested marker of interest, presented as a normally 
distributed continuous variable. For such linear regression models, the tested marker will be an outcome variable.  
Result s will be presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally 
distributed variables, and as median and inter -quartile range for non- normally 
distributed variables. Continuous variables will be compared using the independent samples t test if normally distributed and the Wilcoxon rank sum test if skewed. The 
Pearson chi -square test will be used to compare categorical variables. A p-value of

this null hypothesis is 0.05.  Figure 1 below illustrates  the difference  in statistical power 
as a function of  sample  size and the difference in regression slopes (λ2 –λ1) that we 
wish to detect. Therefore, estimated sample size is 30 study partic ipants (15 in 
experimental aCRT arm, and 15 in control arm). After adjustment of the sample size for 
a loss of follow -up (+ 6%) estimated sample size is 32 participants  (16 in  in 
experimental aCRT arm, and 15 in control arm) .

Risk Analysis  
 
Potential Risks  
This is a randomized clinical trial of 2 FDA -approved CRT strategies. Patients will 
receive commercially available FDA -approved device. There is no incremental risk of 
health for study participants.  
 
Very low risk of confidentiality loss alw ays exists in any clinical research. All efforts will 
be made to keep confidentiality. Patient will be notified immediately if any unforeseen 
breach in confidentiality occurs (e.g. stolen computer). Safeguards will be in place to protect the identity of th e patients and their private health information. Study ID will be 
assigned by [CONTACT_9137] , and all following collected data will be connected 
with this study ID, but not with  the name  [CONTACT_73150]. Private health information 
connected with pati ent’s name [CONTACT_272799] a secure location in the office , and 
limited number of people will have access to it (PI [INVESTIGATOR_32528]).  
 
Version 6 Electrical dyssynchrony measures: Adaptive CRT effect  (ELDYSME aCRT)  
 Page [ADDRESS_333463]: The effects of magnetic fields in an MRI scanner have been  
extensively studied, and there are no known significant risks with an MRI exam. 
Patients will not be allowed to participate if they have a pacemaker, an implanted 
defibrillator or certain other implanted electronic or metallic devices. Gadolinium 
contrast will be administered,  which is F DA-approved and used routinely for MRI 
exams. The injection of contrast may  cause discomfort, tingling or warmth in the lips, 
metallic taste in the mouth, tingling in the arm, nausea, or headache. These symptoms 
occur in less than 1% (less than 1 in 100) o f people and go away quickly.  There is a 
small risk of an allergic reaction to gadolinium; however,  severe allergic reaction occurs 
in less than one in 300,[ADDRESS_333464] higher risk of complications 
with MRI and will be excluded from this  study.  
Insertion of the needle to give gadolinium may cause minor pain, bruising and/or infection  at the injection site.  People with severe kidney failure who receive gadolinium 
are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_272769]/Nephrogenic Fibrosing 
Dermopathy (NSF/NFD).  Patients  with severe kidney failure that receive gadolinium 
have a risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_248526]/NFD of 1- 5 %. Patients with severe kidney disease, 
measured by [CONTACT_171895] <30ml/min will not be allowed to participate.  
Patients with a prior history of being a machinist, welder, metal worker, or  similar  activity  
that poses the potential risk of metal exposure to the eyes, will be asked to undergo screening orbit x -rays to rule out the presence of metal fragments. The amount of 
radiation  exposure from the required series of skull x -rays is approximately 0.[ADDRESS_333465]: Six -minute walk tests pose no more risk than a subject would 
experience walking down the street. Should there be any cardiac symptoms while walking,  the test will be stop ped, and the participant allowed to rest.  
ECG/ ECG i: There is a low risk that mild s kin irritation may occur from the electrode 
patches used to obtain an electrocardiogram  (ECG body surface mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) . 
 
CT Scan : Although  the amount of radiation the patients w ill be exposed to is higher than 
from a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] x -ray, the risk of harmful effects from a single exam is very small.  
Intravenous Radiocontrast Agent  Omnipaque 350  and Oral Beta Blocker :  Most 
people do not experience side effects or complications; however , out of more than 
73,000 patient studied
25, Mild to moderate reactions -  defined as reactions that  either 
require no therapy or if therapy is given and patient is sent home from the radiology 
department - occur in 0.2% of cases. Severe reactions that necessitate intravascular 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_272770] 0.016% of cases. The risk of death is 1/100,[ADDRESS_333466] that can cause adverse reactions 
include: Death (1/100,000 persons), sneezing and nasal congestion, hives, itching, rash, and swelling; laryngeal (oral) edema; bronchospasm; and anaphylaxis, rigors (shakin g, chills, fever); seizure; numbness; malaise and achiness; pulmonary edema; 
chest pain; and hypertension

clinical staff providing care and/or the radiologist at the diagnostic imaging department 
at the time of the scan will determine whether administration of a beta blocker is necessar y before CT scan and will not be administered to a patient if a contraindication 
exists.  
Needle Insertion  
Insertion of the needle  to administer contrast  may cause minor pain, bruising and/or 
infection at the injection site.  
 
Risk Minimization  
All efforts will be made to keep confidentiality. Safeguards will be in place to protect the 
identity of the patients and their private health information. Study ID will be assigned by 
[CONTACT_9137] , and all following collected data will be connected with this  study 
ID, but not with  the name  [CONTACT_73150]. Private health information connected with 
patient’s name [CONTACT_272800] a secure location in the office , and limited number of 
people will have access to it (PI [INVESTIGATOR_32528]).  
 
IVs and or blood draws will be performed by [CONTACT_272792].  
Gadolinium administration:  
Patients with renal insufficiency with GFR <30ml/min  and pregnant women will be 
excluded to minimize any  risks a ssociated with gadolinium administration for the 
contrast -enhanced MRI. A physician will be available during the procedure to administer 
any necessary care if side effects do occur, and to determine when or if the injection of 
the gadolinium should be stopped . 
MRI examination:  
No one will be allowed to enter the magnet room when a patient is in the magnet room  
unless they are involved in the study. No one will be allowed to bring magnetic metal 
objects  near the magnet when other persons are in or near the m agnet. The magnet 
room will be  kept closed during the study, and will be opened only by [CONTACT_272793]. Individuals with metal implants and fillings are excluded  from the 
study as described in the exclusion criteria. Patients will  be asked to leave magnetic 
metal objects outside the magnet room , and patients will be required to fill out a 
questionnaire regarding MR safety and the presence of metal objects in their bodies. 
Care will be taken to limit the RF power  deposition and gradient rise times to well within 
FDA guidelines. The MRI scanner’s  software contains safeguards to prevent both 
excessive RF power and above- threshold gradient changes. The operating technologist 
will be in voice contact [CONTACT_10970] , and the  patient will be told that he/she can 
contact [CONTACT_272794] a request to be taken out of the magnet. All 
subjects will be carefully screened for the presence of any  contraindications prior to 
them signing the consent form.  
Six Minute Walk Test:

November 20th, 2015   Clinical Investigational Plan  
 Confidential  CPR cer tified personnel will accompany the participant and access to emergency 
equipment  will be available. The participants’  vital signs will be monitored before and 
after the six minute test. 
Psychological risk:  
The psychological risk of participating in the st udy may be a transient increase in worry 
about  potential disease. Subjects will be given  the opportunity to ask questions of study  
personnel  on this topic. The study coordinators and investigators have extensive 
experience working  with patients with these diseases.  
Pregnant women:  
Most women included in this study will not be of child- bearing potential (post -
menopausal).  Women of child- bearing potential who are not on reliable birth control (as 
assessed by [CONTACT_5936]) will have a urine HCG test done to obtain pregnancy status 
before MRI is performed. MRI with contrast will not be performed on a pregnant woman.  If participants become pregnant over the course of the study, they will be asked to notify their physician immediately.  If patients who become pregn ant have already completed 
the cardiac MRI, they will be maintained as study participants, otherwise they will be excluded.  There is no additional risk of CRT to pregnant women.  
cCT examination:  
Cardiac CT will be acquired using a prospective scan. Total effective dose is 3 -4mSv, 
the equivalent of 7.5 -10 mammograms.
26 Patients will complete both the “Cardiac CT 
Screening Form” and “Patient Contrast Questionnaire and Procedure Record” pri or to 
undergoing scanning. These two forms are standard procedure in the OHSU diagnostic 
radiology department prior to CT scanning with contrast. The OHSU diagnostic 
radiology department will review both forms before scanning.  
 
IVs and or Blood Draws  
All IVs and/or Blood Draws will be performed by [CONTACT_272795].  
 CT Contrast administration -  GFR:  
Patients with renal insufficiency with GFR <30ml/min and pregnant women will be excluded to minimize any risks associated with contrast administration for the contrast -
enhanced CT. A physician will be available during the procedure to administer any 
necessary care if side effects do occur, and to determine when or if the injection of the 
contrast should be stopped.  
 
A GFR test will be ordered and paid for by [CONTACT_272796]. The patient will complete the test 
according to the following timeline per criteria based off Policy # 300.02 in the OHSU 
Diagnostic Radiology manual.

Patients  whose most recent eGFR<60 and >[ADDRESS_333471] recent eGFR <[ADDRESS_333472].  
Serious adverse advents will be reported to the IRB  
 
Potential Benefits  
 
There is potential for benefit to the patient since this is the patients ’ last opportunity to 
get quality imagi ng of their heart before CRT implantation.  All patients are about to 
receive  a CRT device. CRT devices create immense amounts  of artifact on both MRI 
and CT.  Images will be  made available to the patients’ treating physicians.  
This study will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of reverse electrical and 
mechanical remodeling with a CRT, and will help in identifying appropriate candidates 
for aCRT.

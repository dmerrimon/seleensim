VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  2.0 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title of Clinical 
Trial: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Compare the Effects of VI-0521, Phentermine, and  Placebo on Ambulatory Blood 
Pressure in Overweight or Obese Subjects  
Sponsor:  VIVUS LLC (VIVUS)  
Phase of Development:  4 
Trial Rationale:  Qsymia® (known as VI-0521 in investigational studies) has been 
approved in the US since [ADDRESS_803198] to a reduced -calorie diet 
and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m
2 or greater 
(obese) and 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least 
one weight-related comorbidity such as hypertension, type 2 d iabetes 
mellitus (T2DM), or dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  
Clinical data from the VI -0521 phase 2 and 3 studies indicate that 
VI-0521 is associated with a clinically meaningful decrease in blood 
pressure in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Blood pressure 
changes reached their respective peaks within 4 -8 weeks of treatment 
initiation and remained stab le for up to one year. 
A large body of evidence indicat es that blood pressure measured in an 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) setting throughout the 
day has predictive value for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over and above measureme nts obtained in-clinic. Although 
blood pressure measurements obtained in- clinic have been utilized in 
clinical trials demonstrating improved blood pressure control as well as improved outcomes, ABPM can offer a broader assessment of blood pressure responses. Given that blood pressure data collected to date for VI-[ADDRESS_803199] placed in the context of comparison to placebo, 
and to phentermine, which in addition to being a component of VI -
0521, is also commonly used alone for the short- term treatment of 
obesity. 
Trial Objectives:  The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of VI-0521 on 
blood pressure as measured by 24-hr ABPM, compared to both placebo 
and an active control (phentermine 30 mg). 
Trial Design:  This randomized, double-blind, placebo  and active comparator -
controlled study will be conducted at about 35 sites in the US . 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 7 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  Approximately 555 subjects will be randomized, stratified by [CONTACT_547], 
age, and hypertensive status, to daily treatment with top -dose VI-0521 
(phentermine and topi[INVESTIGATOR_43642]-release capsules 15 mg/92 mg), 
phentermine 30 mg , or placebo (185 subjects per group). Subjects will 
undergo a four-week titration period with dose increases until the randomized dose is reached . 
Following randomization, subjects will receive diet and exercise counseling on maintaining an appropriate healthy diet with a recommended initial caloric deficit of approximately [ADDRESS_803200] days of the 
week. The  total duration of study treatment will be 8 weeks (4 weeks 
of dose titration and 4 weeks of treatment at the assigned dose) with 24-hr ABPM recording s performed at baseline/randomization and 
again at Week 8/end of study or early termination . Clinic visits will 
occur at Screening, Baseline ( 2-day outpatient visit), Week 4, and 
Week 8/end of study (2-day outpatient visit). The 24 -hr ABPM data 
will be read  and analyzed in a blinded manner by a central reader, 
using validated software.

VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  Primary Endpoint 
Evaluation: The primary endpoint of the study is the change from baseline to Week 
8 in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) as measured by 24- hr ABPM.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  The secondary endpoints of the study are: 
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in mean diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP) as measured by 24 -hr ABPM;  
• Mean change in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8 as 
measured in clinic.  
Exploratory Endpoints:  The exploratory endpoints of the study are: 
• Mean hourly change in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8; 
• Change in mean daytime and nighttime SBP as measured by 24-hr ABPM from baseline to Week  8; 
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in nighttime “dippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” of SBP, and the percentage of subjects with a normal SBP “dippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” pattern at Week 8. A normal “dippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” pattern of SBP will be defined as a reduction of mean nighttime SBP of ≥ 10% relative to mean daytime SBP during the same 24- hr recording;  
o SBP dippi[INVESTIGATOR_606331]: 100 x [(mean daytime SBP – mean nighttime SBP)/ mean daytime SBP] 
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in nighttime “dippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” of DBP, and the percentage of subjects with a normal DBP “dippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” pattern at Week 8. A normal “dippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” pattern of DBP will be defined as a reduction of mean nighttime DBP of ≥ 10% relative to mean daytime D BP during the same 24-hr recording. 
o DBP dippi[INVESTIGATOR_606331]: 100 x [(mean daytime DBP – mean nighttime DBP)/ mean daytime DBP]  
For assessment of daytime and nighttime blood pressure, “night” will be defined as the mean of all systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure values recorded between 24:00 and 05:00 (inclusive) and “day” will be defined as the mean of all systolic and diastolic blood pressure values recorded between 07:30 and 21:30 (inclusive);  
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in mean 24- hr heart rate, mean 
daytime heart rate, mean nighttime heart rate, and mean hourly heart rate;  
• Mean percent change in body weight from baseline to Week 8.  
Safety Evaluation: Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_431817], changes in laboratory parameters, changes in ECG, physical exam findings, vital signs, and requirement for rescue therapy for blood pressure and T2DM. 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 9 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  Statistical 
Considerations  All analyses will be performed on the intent- to-treat (ITT) population. 
For the primary endpoint, and all other endpoints evaluating continuous variables, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to evaluate between group differences in changes from baseline (top -dose VI-0521 vs. placebo, top-dose VI-0521 vs. 
phentermine 30 mg, and phentermine 30 mg vs. placebo) in mean 24-hr SBP. Factors included in the model are treatment (VI-0521, 
phentermine, and placebo), gender (male; female), age (< 50; ≥ 50 years), and hypertensive status  (no medical diagnosis of or treatment 
for hypertension; medical diagnosis of hypertension treated with 0-2 antihypertensive agents; or medical diagnosis of hypertension treated with 3 or more antihypertensive agents). Baseline values of the dependent variable will be adjusted in the model as a covariate. Multiple imputation method will be applied to impute missing Week 8 measurements. Adjusted means (LS Mean ± standard error) with associated two -sided 95% confidence intervals for the between-
treatment comparisons and for the changes from baseline will be reported. 
To claim success for a non -inferiority test, the upper bound of the two-
sided 95% confidence interval for the between -treatment group 
difference (VI-0521 minus placebo or phentermine) in mean change from baseline in 24 -hr SBP should be less than 3 mmHg. If the upper 
bound of the two- sided 95% confidence interval is less than 0 mmHg 
(i.e., p-value less than 0.05 significance level), superiority will be 
claimed. 
A hierarchical gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_606332]-wise type 1 error o f the primary and secondary endpoints. The order of 
the hypothesis testing will be: (1) the comparison between top-dose VI-0521 and placebo for non- inferiority, (2) the comparison between 
top-dose VI-0521 and placebo for superiority, (3) the comparison between top-dose VI- 0521 and phentermine for non- inferiority, and (4) 
the comparison between top -dose VI-0521 and phentermine for 
superiority. The comparison between phentermine and placebo will be for assay sensitivity and will not be included in the hierarc hical testing 
procedure. 
If the superiority of top -dose VI- 0521 versus phentermine is achieved 
for the primary endpoint, the same testing order will be applied in the 
same manner to the secondary endpoints: change from baseline to Week 8 in mean DBP as measured by 24-hr ABPM, and then mean change in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8 as measured in clinic, respectively. In this hierarchical testing procedure, only when testing of a given hypothesis is successful will the subsequent 
hypothesis tests will be evaluated; otherwise, the subsequent 
hypothesis tests will be considered exploratory. 
VI-0521   15 October 2021 
Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 10 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  Subgroup ABPM analyses will be performed on subjects within each 
baseline stratum for hypertensive  status. All analyses will be described 
in further detail in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Sample Size 
Determination:  Approximately 555 subjects (185 per group) will be randomized to top-dose VI-0521, phentermine [ADDRESS_803203] deviation of 10 mmHg for change in mean 24- hr SBP as 
measured by [CONTACT_44117], the intended sample size of 185 subjects per treatment group will provide 80% power to detect superiority of VI-
0521 to comparator treatments (placebo or phentermine) if the 
comparator subtracted change in mean SBP has a value of less than -
3.0 mmHg, and will provide 80% power to demonstrate non- inferiority 
based on a non- inferiority margin of [ADDRESS_803204] 
at 2-sided alpha=0.05 for demonstrating superiority and at 1-sided 
alpha=0.025 for demonstrating non- inferiority. This sample size 
estimate also accounts for a 5% drop -out rate over the course of the 
study.

VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  4.0 BACKGROUND  
4.1 VI-0521 
Qsymia® (known as VI-0521 in investigational studies) has been approved in the US since [ADDRESS_803208] to a reduced -calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight 
management in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese) and 
27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight -related comorbidity such 
as hypertension, type [ADDRESS_803209] for oral administration that contains VIVUS’ proprietary 
formulations of immediate -release phentermine hydrochloride beads and extended- release 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_606334] a hard gelatin capsule. The clinical development program of VI-0521 for the treatment of obesity enrolled more than 
5,000 subjects in multiple studies, including two large pi[INVESTIGATOR_606335] 3,500 subjects were treated for 1 year , and an extension study in which more than 600 subjects were 
treated for up to 2 years.
1 Data from these pi[INVESTIGATOR_606336]® produces 
significant weig ht loss averaging approximately 10% at one year in conjunction with 
improvements in obesity -related co -morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].2,[ADDRESS_803210] commonly observed adverse events, notably paresthesia, dry mouth, dysgeusia, and insomnia, are well known and characterized side effects of one or the other individual components and do not represent the new onset of side effects arising from  the 
combined pharmacology of the two component drugs. There was no evidence of any new or unexpected safety issues with Qsymia
® relative to phentermine or topi[INVESTIGATOR_606337]. 
Phentermine, as a sympathomimetic agent, has been a subject of concern for possible 
cardiovascular adverse reactions such as tachycardia or elevation of blood pressure. Although 
mechanistically, these effects could be caused by [CONTACT_606349] , it is likely that the selective release of 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_606338] 5-hydroxytryptamine 
activity provides a rational basis for it having minimal cardiovascular  effects at therapeutic 
doses.[ADDRESS_803211] increases in heart rate compared to placebo, but no increases in systolic 
or diastolic blood pressure.
5 When phentermine was given in combination with topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], 
increases in heart rate were still observed  at the top dose level, but clinically  meaningful 
decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) compared to placebo were achieved.
2,3,5,6 
4.2 Cardiovascular Risk and Blood Pressure Changes  
The association between blood pressure and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) has been extensively evaluated, and it is now recognized that in adults of middle age or older, increased blood pressure is associated with an increased risk for MACE.
7,[ADDRESS_803212] of VI -0521 on blood pressure as measured by 
24-hr ABPM, compared to both placebo and an active control (phentermine 30 mg). 6.0 TRIAL DESIGN 
This randomized, double-blind, placebo  and active comparator -controlled study will be 
conducted at about 35 sites in the US . Approximately 555 e ligible subjects will be randomly 
assigned with equal probability, to daily treatment with top -dose VI-0521 (phentermine and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_43642]- release capsules 15 mg/92 mg) , phentermine 30 mg, or placebo 
(1:1:1 ratio;185 subjects per group). Stratification factors include gender (male; female), a ge 
(< 50; ≥ 50 years), and hypertensive status (no medical diagnosis of or treatment for 
hypertension; medical diagnosis of hypertension treated with 0 -2 antihypertensive agents; or 
medical diagnosis of hypertension treated with 3 or more antihypertensive agents).
 
Subjects will undergo a four-week titration period with weekly dose increases until the 
randomized dose is reached  (Section 9.4.1). 
Following randomization, subjects will receive diet and exercise counseling on maintaining an appropriate healthy diet with a recommended initial caloric deficit of approximately [ADDRESS_803213] days of the week. The total 
duration of study treatment will be 8 weeks (4 weeks of dose titration and 4 weeks of treatment 
at the assigned dose) with 24 -hr ABPM recording s performed at baseline/randomization and 
again at Week 8/end of study or early termination . Clinic visits will occur at Screening, Baseline 
(2-day outpatient visit), Week 4, and Week 8/end of study (2-day outpatient visit). The 24 -hr 
ABPM data will be read  and analyzed in a blinded manner by a central reader, using validated 
software. 
In order to minimize the potential confounding of study results by [CONTACT_606350], all concomitant medications, particularly those for management of blood pressure or other 
weight-related comorbidities , will be fixed in number, dose, and frequency for the duration of the 
study unless specific “rescue” criteria are met for blood pressure (≥ 160/100 mmHg, or ≤ 100/60 mmHg and symptoms of hypotension ). Any changes in concomitant medication will be fully 
documented.

9.0 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
9.1 Study Treatment  
Eligible subjects will receive either top-dose VI-0521 (phentermine and topi[INVESTIGATOR_43642]-
release capsules 15 mg/92 mg) , phentermine 30 mg capsules, or placebo capsules for daily use . 
The duration of treatment will be 8 weeks, and the total duration of participation will be a total of 
approximately 12 weeks.  
9.2 Allocation to Treatment 
Subjects will be assigned to study treatment via an electronic data capture (EDC)/ Randomization 
and Trial Supply Management (RTSM) System. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned with 
equal probability, to daily treatment with top-dose VI -0521, phentermine 30 mg, or placebo 
(1:1:1 ratio). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_547] (male; female), age (<  50; ≥ 50 years), 
and hypertensive status (no medical diagnosis of or treatment for hypertension; medical diagnosis of hypertension treated with 0- 2 antihypertensive agents; or medical diagn osis of 
hypertension treated with 3 or more antihypertensive agents).  For hypertensive patients who are 
being treated with fixed -dose combinations, these should be counted as [ADDRESS_803223] the EDC/RTSM through a 
designated website and provide the requested information about the study subject. The randomization assignment will be made, and si te personnel will be instructed to dispense a 
specific titration blister card or treatment bottle  corresponding to the treatment assignment to the 
study subject. Additional study drug will be shipped to sites to replace those dispensed.

connecting the cuff to the monitor is not kinked. 
Diurnal and nocturnal blood pressure variation will be assessed during the study; therefore 
subjects should be reminded to go to bed and rise about the same time during the study. 
A central 24 -hr ABPM reading laboratory will perform data collection, reading, quality 
evaluation and data analyses. Software for the ABPM device  will use default settings for 
exclusion of outliers (including failed inflations) from the overall averaged statistics on the final 
ABPM report for each recording. Additionally, readings that are not acceptable will contain error codes asso ciated with failed inflations specifying what happened (i.e., too much movement, 
kinked hose, etc.). Data transfers will include all data, including data excluded from analyses for errors. Excluded data will be labeled with error codes. 
All readers will be  blinded to treatment.  Quality control w ill be monitored by [CONTACT_9251].

11.[ADDRESS_803248] also assess whether any adverse event s meet the criteria for classification as 
an SAE (see Section 12.1.4), which requires immediate notific ation to VIVUS  or its designated 
representative.  
12.1.1 Severity Assessment  
Investigators will assess the severity of all adverse events using the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of each adverse event. For purposes of consis tency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
• MILD: Does not interfere with the subject’s usual function; 
• MODERATE: Interferes to some extent with the subject’s usual function; or 
• SEVERE: Interferes significantly with the subject’s usual function.  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. A severe event is not necessarily a serious event . For example, a headache may be severe (interferes 
significantly with subject’s daily function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs  (see Section 12.1.4). 
12.1.2 Causality Assessment  
Investigators are required to provide an assessment of causality, for all adverse events (serious 
and non-serious) observed during this study. This assessment will provide a determination of 
whether, in the investigator’s judgment, there exists a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational product caused or contributed to an adverse event. For this assessment, 
investigators must categorize the causality as either “related” or “not related.” For an adverse event to be considered “related” to the study treatment, there should be evidence that the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of study treatment, or that the event follows a known response pattern to the drug. Causality would be further confirmed by [CONTACT_606359][INVESTIGATOR_217909], and reappearance of the event upon rechallenge. 
VI-[ADDRESS_803249] finding should be reported as an 
adverse event are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms ; 
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or 
• Test result is considered by [CONTACT_606360] a clinically 
significant finding. 
12.1.4 Serious Adverse Events or Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions  
As defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 312.32), an adverse event or suspected adverse d rug reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or the 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death; 
• A life-threatening adverse event (Note: An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “life-t hreatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject in immediate risk of death . It does not include an adverse 
event or suspected adverse event that, had it occurred in more severe form, might have caused death . The determination of whether an adverse event is life-threatening can be 
based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28216].); 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or sub stantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; or  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition . 
For this study, blood pressure values that exceed 180 mmHg (systolic) or 110 mmHg (diastoli c) 
should be reported as serious adverse events. 
If either the Sponsor or investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be 
considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_80220].

• Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (e.g.,  for 
elective cosmetic surgery); and  
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical proced ures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as adverse events. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse event, and the resu lting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the adverse 
event. 
12.[ADDRESS_803250] non- leading question, such as “Have you experienced anything new or 
different since your previous study visit? ” 
Certain adverse events require prompt and specific action by [CONTACT_277939]. 
12.[ADDRESS_803251] be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information. 
This timeframe a lso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously reported 
SAEs. 
In the event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (e.g., if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 1 business day after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.  
For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to VIVUS or designee in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an 
investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_606361]-up information in an expedited fashion. This information may be more detailed than that captured 
on the adverse event CRF. In general, this will include a description of the SAE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality . Information on other possible ca uses of the event, such as concomitant 
medications and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to VIVUS or designee. 
12.4.2 Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
Non-serious adverse events meeting the reporting requirements described above ( Section 12.4) 
are to be reported on the Adverse Event CRFs, which are to be submitt ed to VIVUS  or designee. 
12.4.[ADDRESS_803252] immediately discontinue study treatment and report the pregnancy to VIVUS or designee within 1 business day of learning of the pregnancy. 
The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination 
(i.e., elective pregnancy termination) and then notify VIVUS or designee of the outcome. The investigator will provide this information as a follow- up to the initial pregnancy report.  
For reported pregnancies that result in a live birth, the status of the newborn should be assessed at the time of birth . The status of an aborted fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] , 
unless pre-abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly. 
If pregnancy outcomes meet the criteria for classification as SAEs (i.e.,  stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs . 
Similarly, any pregnancy outcomes that are considered to be adverse events should be reported 
as such on the appropriate CRF. However, pregnancy in itself need not be reported as an adverse event if there is no associated adverse outcome.

Clinical Trial Protocol  OB-409  Page 33 of 43 
VIVUS LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  For reporting purposes, ectopic pregnancies should be reported as SAEs, but because the fetus is 
not potentially viable, they need not be reported as a pregnancy. 
13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Statistical Analysis and Methods  
All analyses will be performed on  the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized subjects 
who received at least one dose of study drug). Analyses of a per-protocol population may also be 
utilized to confirm the presence or absence of a pressor signal.  Subject demographic data and 
baseline characteristics will be summarized for all subjects enrolled in the study.  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this clinical 
trial will be documented in a prospectively developed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). This 
document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or i ts analysis will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendment. Additional statistical analyses other than those described in this section may be performed if deemed appropriate and included in the plan. 
13.1.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of the study is change from baseline to Week 8 (or imputed Week 8 values 
for early termination subjects) in mean SBP obtained from [ADDRESS_803253] of study treatment may be ruled out if the 
upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the between- treatment comparison 
with placebo is less than [ADDRESS_803254] to changes from baseline 
to Week 8 in mean 24-hr SBP. 
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on the intent- to-treat (ITT) population. An 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to evaluate between -group differences in 
changes from baseline (top -dose VI-0521 vs. placebo, top- dose VI-0521 vs. phentermine, and 
phentermine vs. placebo) in mean 24-hr SBP. Factors included in the model are treatment (VI 
0521, phentermine , and placebo ), gender (male and female), age (< 50; ≥ 50 years), and 
hypertensive status ( no medical diagnosis of or treatment for hypertension; medical diagnosis of 
hypertension treated with 0-2 antihypertensive agents; or medical diagnosis of hypertension 
treated with 3 or more antihypertensive agents ). Baseline values of the dependent variable will 
be adjusted in the model as a covariate. Multiple imputation method will be applied to impute missing Week 8 measurements . Adjusted means (LS Mean ± standard error) with associated 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the between -treatment comparisons and for the changes 
from baseline will be reported.  
To claim success for a non -inferiority test, the upper bound of the two -sided 95% confidence 
interval for the between -treatment group difference (VI-0521 minus placebo or phentermine) in 
mean change from baseline in 24 -hr SBP should be less than 3 mmHg. If the upper bound of the 
two-sided 95% confidence interval is less th an 0 mmHg (i.e., p- value less than 0.05 significance 
level), superiority will be claimed.  
VI-[ADDRESS_803255] of missing data on the conclusion of the primary analysis. The details of the sensitivity analyses will be included in the SAP . 
13.1.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same methods as described above for the primary endpoints. 
The secondary endpoints will be: 
• Change from baseline to Week 8 in mean DBP as measured by 24 -hr ABPM;  
• Mean change in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8 as measured in clinic. 
13.1.4 Multiplicity Adjustment to Control Family -wise Type 1 Error Rate  
A hierarchical gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_606332]- wise type 1 error of the 
primary and secondary endpoints. The order of the hypothesis testing will be: (1) the comparison 
between top-dose VI-0521 and placebo for non- inferiority, (2) the comparison between top-dose 
VI-0521 and placebo for superiority, ( 3) the comparison between top- dose VI-0521 and 
phentermine for non-inferiority, and (4) the comparison between top- dose VI-0521 and 
phentermine for superiority. The comparison between phentermine and placebo will be for assay sensitivity and will not be included in the hier archical testing procedure . 
If the superiority of top-dose VI-0521 versus phentermine is achieved for the primary endpoint, the same testing order will be applied in the same manner to the secondary endpoints: change from baseline to Week 8 in mean DBP as measured by 24-hr ABPM, and then mean change in 
SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 8 as measured in clinic, respectively . 
In this hierarchical testing procedure, only when testing of a given hypothesis is successful will  
the subsequent hypothesis tests will be evaluated; otherwise, the subsequent hypothesis tests will be considered exploratory. 
13.1.5 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
Exploratory endpoints that are continuous measurements will be analyzed using the same 
methods as described above for the primary en dpoint. For categorical outcomes, differences 
between treatments will be evaluated using a non -parametric method. Details will be provided in 
the SAP. 
The exploratory endpoints will be the difference between treatment groups (top-dose VI-0521 vs. placebo, top-dose VI-0521 vs. phentermine, and phentermine vs. placebo ) in the change from 
baseline in:

between 07:30 and 21:30 (inclusive). 
13.1.6 Safety Analyses 
Safety analyses will be performed on the ITT population (all randomized subjects who received 
at least one dose of study drug). 
The incidence of adverse events will be summarized . The summary will be repeated for events 
considered related to study drug and for any serious adverse events. Laboratory results and vital 
signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_606362]. Changes to physical exam and ECG and requirement for rescue therapy for blood pressure and T2DM will be compared across 
treatment groups. The number of subjects taking concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_12617]. The primary reason for any early discontinuation will be summarized . The results 
of laboratory tests will be included in the safety analysis.  
Adverse events will be coded according to MedDRA and summarized for each treatment group . 
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing advers e events in each treatment group will 
be tabulated by [CONTACT_14340] .

will provide 80% power to detect superiority of VI-0521 to comparator treatments (placebo or 
phentermine) if the comparator subtracted change in mean SBP has a value of less than -3.0 
mmHg, and will provide 80% power to demonstrate non- inferiority based on a non- inferiority 
margin of [ADDRESS_803257] at 2-sided 
alpha=0.05 for demonstrating superiority and at 1-sided alpha=0.025 for demonstrating non-inferiority. This sample size estimate also accounts for a 5% drop -out rate over the course of the 
study. 
14.0 TRIAL TERMINATION CRITERIA  
Premature termination of this clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory au thority decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC, or drug safety problems. In addition, VIVUS retains the right 
to discontinue this trial at any time.  
If a clinical trial is prematurely terminated or discontinued, VIVUS  will promptly notify the 
investigators . After notification, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_27936]

that the protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines are being followed . The monitors 
may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The 
investigator and institution will allow VIVUS  monitors or its agen ts and appropriate regulatory 
authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  
The study site and trial-related documents may be subject to review by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_606363] s, and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_277954].  
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 
VI-[ADDRESS_803260] /Independent Ethics Committee  
Regulations require that an IRB/IEC oversee all investigational drug clinical trials . This board or 
committee, the makeup of which must conform to local and regional regulations, will approve all 
aspects of the trial, including the protocol, advertising and written informed consent form to be used prior to initiation of the trial. It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the clinical t rial protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other 
relevant documents, e.g., advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the investigator f ile. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals sh ould 
be forwarded to VIVUS or its designee.  
Amendments to the protocol must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_606364]/IEC prior to implementation . The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to 
IRB/IEC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and VIVUS or designee in writing within 5 working days after the implementation.  
The investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_1683]/IEC advised of the progress of the study and of any changes made to the protocol as deemed appropriate.

5 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study Design  
 This is an open- label , phase I/II study investigating the combination of colony- stimulating 
factor -1 (CSF -1) inhibition using MCS110 with BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy  using dabrafenib  
and trametinib  in patients  with advanced melanoma harboring a BRAF  V600 E/K mutation  . In 
phase I, t he BRAF and MEK inhibition will be maintained at standard dosing with the addition 
of the MCS110 using the “ 3+3” trial design. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  is 
reached and a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is chosen , a single -arm phase II study in 
patients with BRAF mutant melanoma  whose disease has progressed on BRAF/MEK inhibition 
will move forward.    1.2 
Primary Objectives  
 
Phase I:   
• To determine the MTD and RP2D of the combination of MCS110 with dabrafenib  
and trametinib . 
 
Phase II:   
• To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR)  to the combination of MCS110 with 
dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutated melanoma who have had progression on BRAF/MEK 
 
1.3 
Secondary Objectives  
 
Phase I:  
• To evaluate the preliminary overall response rate (ORR) and PFS to the 
combination of MCS110 with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF  
V600E or V600K mutated melanoma who have had progression on BRAF/MEK. 
 Phase II:  
• To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) to the combination of MCS110 with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutated melanoma  who have had progression on BRAF/MEK. 
• To evaluate the overall survival (OS) to the combination of MCS110 with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutated melanoma  who have had progression on BRAF/MEK. 
• To continue to e valuate the safety and tolerability of the combination of MCS110 
with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutated melanoma  who have had progression on BRAF/MEK. 
 
 
1.4 
Exploratory Objectives  
• To investigate the effect of the combination of MCS110 with dabrafenib  and 
trametinib  on mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling and 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March 11 , 201 9 
 
6 the immune tumor microenvironment via collection of blood, archival tumor 
tissue , and optional pre and on- treatment tissue biopsies  obtained during both 
phases of the trial .  
• To investigate the relationship between the levels of tumor DNA  in serially 
collected plasma samples  and the observed clinical outcomes during both phases 
of the trial.

BACKGROUND  
 2.[ADDRESS_697500] deadly form of skin cancer, with over 10,000 deaths estimated in  the US 
in 2016
1. About 40 - 60% of cutaneous melanomas carry mutations in BRAF that lead to  
constitutive activation of downstream signaling through the MAPK pathway . Approximately  
90% of these mutations result in the substitution of glutamic acid for valine  at codon 600 ( BRAF 
V600E), however other activating mutations are known to occur (e.g., BRAF V600K)2,3.  
 BRAF inhibitor therapy with dabrafenib  or vemurafenib  has an improved overall survival in 
patients with BRAF mutations with an even larger effect observed when combined with MEK inhibition using trametinib or  cobimetinib
2,4,5. The response rate to the combination is 64 - 68% ; 
howe ver, these responses are of limited duration. The median PFS for combination BRAF/MEK 
inhibitor therapy is  only 9.9 - 11.4 months.  Progression on therapy is thought to occur primarily 
due to the development of acquired resistance through reactivation of the MAPK pathway4,5. 
  2.2 
MCS110 
 CSF-1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on  monocyte/ macrophage and granulocyte cell 
lineages in normal as well as  tumor cells
6,7. When colony -stimulating factor -1 (CSF -1) or 
interleukin  34 (IL-34) binds to CSF-1R, the receptor is phosphory lated, initiating downstream 
signaling events which result in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, survival and  
migration of monocytes/macrophages8-10.  
 In cancer, increased infiltration of macrophages within and surrounding the tumor mass correlates with i ncreased tumor invasiveness, growth , and poor prognosis. I n breast,  prostate, 
ovarian, and cervical cancer, there is a correlation between tumor -associated  macrophages 
(TAMs) and poor prognosis
11-13. Clinical evidence of TAM  participation in tumor growth is 
corroborated in animal models where CSF- 1R/CSF -[ADDRESS_697501], ovarian, endometrial, and  leukemia cells of myeloid origin express CSF-1R and 
proliferate in response to CSF-16,15-18. Targeting CSF -1 or CSF -1R ha ve the potential to limit 
cancer progression.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656

While CSF -1R levels are infrequently increased on tumor cells compared to analogous normal 
cells, increased CSF -1 ligand in sera of cancer patients is frequently observed and is associated  
with poor prognosis and severity of disease in multiple cancers19,20. This suggests that circulating 
CSF-1 modulates the stroma (i.e., macrophages) that contribute to tumor progression. For 
example, in breast cancer, CSF -[ADDRESS_697502] human macrophage colony stimulating factor (M -CSF; also known as colony- stimulating factor -1 [CSF-1]). CSF-1 
and IL -34 bind to the receptor tyrosine kinase CSF- 1R (CSF -1 Receptor) to drive the 
differentiation, migration and survival of tissue macrophages. MCS110 neutralizes multiple forms of human CSF-1, inhibiting its effect on monocytes and macrophages.   
 Non-Clinical Studies  
 In vitro pharmacology  
In vitro , the ability of MCS110 to neutralize the activity of CSF-[ADDRESS_697503] assay involved CSF-1-dependent proliferation of the mouse myelogenous leukemia cell line M -NFS-60. This cell line responds to various recombinant forms 
of CSF -1, as well as CSF -1 forms present in serum, in medium conditioned by [CONTACT_535894], 
and on the cell surface. MCS110 potently inhibited the proliferation of M- NFS-60 cells in 
response to all human forms of CSF-1 tested. Cell proliferation in response to 10 ng/mL recombinant human CSF-[ADDRESS_697504] the principal in vivo function of 
CSF-1: regulation of the survival, proliferation and differentiation of cells of the mononuclear 
phagocyte lineage. MCS110 induced potent inhibition of the osteoclastogenesis process as well as the morphological changes associated with the differentiation into osteoclasts.  
In vivo pharmacology Given (a) the lack of activity against mouse CSF -1, and (b) the likely immune response that 
would develop with long-term dosing of mice with a humanized monoclonal Antibody (mAb), in vivo effi cacy studies in human tumor cell xenograft models were conducted using two surrogate 
mAbs rather than MCS110 itself. These two surrogate mAbs were 5A1, a rat monoclonal IgG1antibody which neutralizes mouse (host) CSF-1, and 5H4, a mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody which neutralizes human (tumor- derived) CSF -1. Using a combination of these two 
mAbs, inhibition of tumor- induced osteolysis was demonstrated in mice injected intratibially 
with a human breast cancer cell line (MDA -MB-231Luc). Treatment with a combination of 
neutralizing antibodies directed against both the host mouse source of CSF-[ADDRESS_697505] mean osteolytic score and a reduced number of individual animals with clearly evident bone lesions.

To evaluate the competen ce of TAMs for signaling via the CSF1/CSF1R pathway, macrophages 
from spontaneous tumors arising in MMTV- PyMT mice were analyzed for CSF1R expression by 
[CONTACT_4133]. CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ positive TAMs stained positively for CSF1R while CD45− tumor cells showed no expression of the receptor. The functional dependence of TAMs on signaling mediated by [CONTACT_122511]1/CSF1R pathway was assessed after 6 days of treatment with the 5A1 Anti MCSF antibody to show a significant reduction in macrophages (CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ c ells) suggesting a functional interdependency between CSF1 and 
CSF1R in regulating TAMs in this breast cancer model ( Strachan 2013).  
 [IP_ADDRESS] 
Pharmaco kinetics  
 The preclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of MCS110 were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys following single intravenous (i.v) bolus injection of 0.2, 2 or 20 mg/kg, or multiple weekly iv bolus injections of 10 mg/kg for 3 weeks and 2, 20 or 100 mg/kg for up to 13 weeks. Free MCS110 (unbound to target CSF-1) exhibited dose-dependent PK, w ith 
decreasing clearance (CL) and increasing mean residence time (MRT) or effective t1/2 when dose increased. The PK profiles of free MCS110 were notably nonlinear at concentrations below approximately 20 μg/mL, presumably due to target -mediate disposition . 
 In the 13-week study, 2 out of 22 animals tested had anti-drug antibodies detected in serum, which correlated with lower MCS110 exposure at the corresponding time points. For PD, time and dose dependent increase in total CSF-1 was observed in the 13- week study following 
MCS110 administration, presumably due to slower clearance of the CSF- 1 after it formed 
immune complexes with MCS110, indicating target engagement. Decreases in other downstream biomarkers such as circulating monocytes and serum NTx were also observed following MCS110 administration.  [IP_ADDRESS] 
Safety Pharmacology and Toxicology  
 The cynomolgus monkey was selected as the relevant species for toxicology studies because MCS110 showed similar functional activity against cynomolgus monkey and human CSF-1 in in vitro bioassays. In cynomolgus monkey studies there were no severe toxicological effects in any animal given MCS110 intravenously as a single dose or as multiple doses once weekly up to 13 weeks and up to doses of 100 mg/kg, showing good tolerability of MCS110 given systemically. Mild increases in liver enzymes were seen in all studies without histopathological correlates, which resolved with clearance of the drug. This included consistent mild/moderate, dose-dependent increases in lactate dehydrogen ase (LD), mild increases in AST, and minimal 
increases in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and ALT. All parameters returned to baseline levels with the clearance of MCS110 from the serum. The most likely cause of these increases is reduced clearance rat e of the serum enzymes due to the diminished numbers of 
Kupffer cells in the liver. This was demonstrated in cynomolgus monkey study with a single intravenous dose of MCS110, which showed a decreased clearance of histidine- tagged creatine 
kinase injected i n parallel to MCS110. After 13 weekly doses, minimal or mild interstitial edema 
was seen in multiple organs histopathologically in all dose groups, including the low- dose group. 
Although periorbital swelling was observed to occur sporadically in all groups (including controls), the increased incidence and severity of periorbital swelling observed at 100 mg/kg

MCS110A2101, a first in human clinical trial  
 CMCS110A2101 was a first in human study in prostate cancer with bone metastases, designed to evaluate safety, tolerability and MTD of MCS110. MCS110 was administered at doses 0.01 mg/kg repeated every 2 weeks in a 28 day cycle for a total of 3 cycles. The study was closed after 3 patients due to prioritization within [COMPANY_001]. No MTD was established.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March 11 , 201 9 
 
10 Clinical safety and tolerability  
MCS110 was well- tolerated and all patients completed the 3 -cycle treatment. The only adverse 
event suspected to be related to  MCS110 was an infusion reaction with chills (Grade 1), 
dizziness (Grade 2) and hypotension (Grade 2).  No DLTs were reported. One patient 
experienced an infusion reaction starting [ADDRESS_697507] MCS110 infusion, which resolved 1 hour af ter occurrence.  
 Clinical pharmacokinetics  
Formal PK analysis was not conducted due to small number of serum samples with measurable concentrations.   Clinical pharmacodynamics No consistent changes in monocyte count were observed in the 3 patients treated. All patients’ peripheral monocytes were within 70% of baseline levels throughout the study.   Clinical efficacy  
Biologic activity of MCS110 was not observed. No consistent direction of change was seen in bone markers.  [IP_ADDRESS] 
MCS110X2101, a clinical trial in healthy volunteers  
 CMCS110X2101 was a phase I study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability and MTD of MCS110 in 52 healthy volunteers (HV). MCS110 was delivered to 27 HV at increasing single doses from 0.01-20 mg/kg. Additionally, 6 HV received 2 doses (5 mg/kg) given 21 days apart, and another 6 received 2 doses (10 mg/kg) given 56 days apart.  Clinical safety and tolerability  
Asymptomatic and reversible creatine kinase (CK) elevations were seen in [ADDRESS_697508] muscle damage since neither troponin T (marker for cardiac muscle damage) nor aldolase (marker for skeletal muscle tissue damage) was elevated. The CK elevations are thought to be caused by [CONTACT_217940]110.  Mild periorbital edema was observed in 4 of 52 HV and was transient, lasting between 2 and 158 days. None of the subjects who presented with periorbital edema had developed anti- drug 
antibodies. The dose limiting toxicity was identified at 20 mg/kg, based on CK elevations exceeding more than 5 times the upper limit of normal. The recommended dose for future studies was set at 10mg/kg.  
 Clinical pharmacokinetics  
Following intravenous administration of MCS110 in healthy volunteers, serum free MCS110 exhibited concentration/dose-depende nt PK, with decreasing CL (clearance) and increasing MRT 
(mean residence time) or effective t1/2 when doses increased from 0.01 to 20 mg/kg  across 8 dose levels. The shape of the serum free MCS110 PK profiles indicated target mediated disposition, where the MCS110 concentration declined more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_217889] 10 μg/mL. This was presumably due to binding of MCS110 to the target, suggesting that serum free MCS110 concentrations above approximately 10 μg/mL is required to 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March 11 , 201 9 
 
11 saturate circulating CSF -1. At the 10 mg/kg single dose level, MCS110 concentrations were 
maintained above 10 μg/mL for up to [ADDRESS_697509] dose. As expected, total CSF -1 exhibited 
dose-dependent increase in plasma following MCS110 treatment, presumably due to slower 
clearance of CSF -1 after it formed immune complexes with MCS110, indicating successful 
target engagement. The total CSF -1 concentration reached plateau at the single- dose level at or 
above 10 mg/kg, and it maintained at the plateau for at least 42 days at the 10 mg/kg dose.  Clinical pharmacodynamics Expected pharmacological responses were observed in downstream biomarkers including dose-dependent decreases in circulating CD14+ or CD14+CD16+ monocytes and C- terminal 
telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX -1), a bone resorption marker. In addition, dose-dependent 
increases in CK were observed. Simulation of steady- state dose-response relationships for 
biomarkers showed that with the once- every -4 week (Q4W) iv administration of MCS110, the 
response of PD biomarkers (CD14+ and CD14+CD16+ monocytes, and CTX- 1) was expected to 
be close to maximal at the doses at or above 5 mg/kg and minimal at doses at or below 1 mg/kg.  [IP_ADDRESS] 
MCS110X2201, a phase II study in pi[INVESTIGATOR_535876]110X2201 is an ongoing phase II study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy with MCS110 in pi[INVESTIGATOR_134364] (PVNS). PVNS is a benign tumor consisting of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, most commonly located to joints. A s 
of 04- Feb-2016, [ADDRESS_697510] been dosed. Seven patients received a single dose of 10 
mg/kg MCS110 - (5) or placebo (2).  Eleven patients received multiple doses of 10 mg/kg MCS110; nine patients received up to 4 i.v. doses and two patients received 6 doses of 10 mg/kg MCS110.   Clinical safety and tolerability  
 Four SAEs were reported, but were not considered related to MCS110. They include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_535877], acute cholecystitis, nausea and vomiting with fever and dehydration, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_363735], dizziness and head congestion 
(this SAE was reported [ADDRESS_697511] dose).  
Common adverse events reported include asymptomatic and reversible CK elevation; mild and reversible periorbital edema; skin adverse reactions (e.g. rash); mild or moderate nausea and vomiting; fever; and headaches. Only one patient was discontinued due to an adverse event (periorbital edema).  
Clinical pharmacokinetics  
PK analysis is ongoing. Prelimin ary data show serum concentration of free MCS110 was similar 
to that observed in the HV study. Serum PK profiles after repeated doses were consistent with anticipated PK profiles on single dose PK. 
Clinical pharmacodynamics Data from the ongoing study in P VNS patients showed an expected decrease in monocytes and 
CTX -1, and an increase in CK in patients treated with MCS110. Maximum CK values were 
generally observed at Day 28 or Day 43 and then returned back to baseline.

12 Clinical efficacy  
After receiving a si ngle dose of 10 mg/kg of MCS110, all 18 patients showed mean reduction in 
tumor volume of 32.8%. In contrast, the 5 patients who received a single dose of placebo, 
showed tumor volume changes of < 20%, with a mean reduction of -7.7%. 
Data from a third inte rim analysis demonstrated the same reduction in tumor volume when 
multiple doses of MCS110 were administered. Nine patients given multiple doses of MCS110 
who completed the primary endpoint of 8- weeks, showed a clear reduction of tumor volume 
ranging from 25% to 75%. Two of these patients showed a moderate response of 25% tumor volume decrease; but all other patients show reduction of > 50%.  
In parallel with the reduction in tumor size, there were also meaningful clinical improvements of 
symptoms related to PVNS.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] MCS110Z2201, a phase II study of MCS110 combined with carboplatin and gemcitabine in 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer 
 
MCS110Z2201 is a randomized, open label, phase II study of MCS110 combined with 
carboplatin and gemcitabine in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer. The study targets TNBC patients with TAM high tumors, who have not previously been treated with chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the addition of MCS110 improves the e fficacy of carboplatin and gemcitabine by [CONTACT_535895].  
 All patients will be given carboplatin (AUC 2) and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) on Days 1 and 8 in 21- day cycles. Additionally, patients randomized to Arm 1 (experimental arm) will receiv e 
MCS110 10 mg/kg Day 1 in 21-day cycles with an additional dose of MCS110 10 mg/kg on Cycle 1 Day 8. As of 3 May 2016, 10 patients were enrolled; 7 to arm 1 and 3 to arm 2.  Clinical safety and tolerability  
 As required by [CONTACT_760], an early safety review was performed on May 25, 2016. The data cutoff was May 3, 2016 and data was collected from seven patients treated with carboplatin/gemcitabine/MCS110 and two patients treated with carboplatin/gemcitabine for 2 full cycles or until discontinuation earlier. After reviewing the safety data, the sponsor and investigators jointly proposed to remove the additional dose of MCS110 on cycle 1/day 8 (C1D8) and to continue optional prophylaxis to prevent infusion reactions.  The Steering Committee reviewed the patient data on May 31, 2016 and found no immediate safety concern with the current dosing. Limited data showed some instances of recurrent increase of liver transaminases after the C1D8. This increase was not seen in all patients, however, and additional data would be necessary to establish any potential relationship. Review of the PK 
parameters indicate a slightly increased Cmax compared to historical data, which implies that 
desired exposures can be achieved without the C1D8 administration. Given this information, the Steering Committee agreed with the recommendation to remove C1D8 additional dose.  Grade 1 -2 infusion reactions related to MCS110 were observed in 3 patients. Additional is

to continue on MCS110 dosing with appropriate prophylaxis and without dose reductions, the Steering Committee deemed no further actions were necessary.  
 
Clinical pharmacokinetics  
A preliminary review of the PK parameters indicates a slightly increased Cmax compared to 
historical data.  
 
Clinical pharmacodynamics No data is available as May 2016  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Interactions  
 
Specific studies to investigate drug -drug interactions (DDI) have not been conducted with 
MCS110. Antibodies that modulate cytokines, which may regulate cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, may cause DDI with small molecule drugs because of the potential to alter CYP -
mediated metabolism (lee et al 2010; Huang et al 2010). However, MCS110 specifically neutralizes CSF -1 and hence it is not expected to modulate cytokines. In addition, as an antibody, 
MCS110 is eliminated through protein catabolism and target-mediated disposition.   2.3 
Dabrafenib 
 Dabrafenib mesylate ([COMPANY_004]2118436B, Tafinlar®; referred to as dabrafenib hereafter), a 4 - 
(3-aminosulfonylphenyl)-5- (pyrimidin -3-yl) thiazole, is an ATP -competitive, selective  
inhibitor of RAF kinase currently in clinical development. On May 29, 2013, the U.S. FDA approved dabrafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic  
melanoma with BRAFV600E mutation as detected by [CONTACT_13247]-approved test (FDA, 2013). On January 10, 2014, the FDA granted accelerated approval to dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib for use in combination to treat patients with unresectable or  
metastatic melanoma with either BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutation as detected by [CONTACT_535896] -approved test (FDA, 2014). 
 Dabrafenib  has been FDA approved for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with 
a BRAF V600E  mutation and is commercially available.  
 
 Pharmacokinetics  
 Following single -dose oral administration of dabrafenib HPMC capsules, plasma 
concentrations peaked approximately 2.[ADDRESS_697513]- dose. Oral bioavailability is near  
complete (94.5%) relative to an intravenous (IV) microdose.  Dabrafen ib is highly bound to plasma proteins (99.6%). Its volume of distribution after 
IV dosing is 45.5 L. Intravenous plasma clearance (12.0 L/hr) is low relative to liver blood flow, suggesting a low hepatic extraction ratio drug. Median terminal half- life is  
approximately 8 hours after a single oral dose.

Three metabolites of dabrafenib were characterized and may contribute to activity.  
[COMPANY_004]2285403 (hydroxy- metabolite [M7]) PK paralleled that of dabrafenib, while the  
carboxy - ([COMPANY_004]2298683 [M4]) and desmethyl- ([COMPANY_004]2167542 [M8]) metabolites 
exhibited a longer t1/2 (21-22 hours) and accumulated following repeat dosing. M7 is the most abundant, accounting for 54% of the three metabolites. Similar to dabrafenib concentrations, exposure for all metabolites showed a less than dose proportional increase with repeat dosing.  Fecal excretion was a major route of dabrafenib elimination in humans, accounting for 71.1% of the dose administered, and renal excretion accounted for about 20% of drug elimination.  
 Administration  of dabrafenib with a high-fat, high- calorie meal reduced the oral  
bioavailability of dabrafenib when compared to the fasted state with a decrease in Cmax  
and AUC of 51% and 31%, respectively, and delayed its absorption. Therefore, the current recommendati on is to administer dabrafenib under fasting conditions, either 1 h 
before or 2 h after a meal.  
 
 Drug Interactions  
 Dabrafenib induces CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Dabrafenib decreased the systemic exposures of midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate), S- warfarin (a CYP2C9 su bstrate), and Rwarfarin  (a 
CYP3A4/CYP1A2 substrate). Co-administration of dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily for 15 days and a single dose of midazolam 3 mg (a CYP3A4 substrate) decreased midazolam AUC by 74%. Co-administration of dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily for 15  days and a single dose of warfarin 15 
mg decreased the AUC of S -warfarin (a CYP2C9  substrate) by 37% and the AUC of R- warfarin 
(a CYP3A4/CYP1A2 substrate) by 33%.  In vitro  studies show that dabrafenib is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 while hydroxy -
dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib are CYP3A4 substrates. Co- administration  of dabrafenib 
75 mg twice daily and ketoconazole 400 mg once daily (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) for 4 days increased dabrafenib AUC by 71%, hydroxy-dabrafenib AUC by 82%, a nd desmethyl -
dabrafenib AUC by 68%. Co-administration of dabrafenib 75 mg twice daily and gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) for 4 days increased dabrafenib AUC by 47%, with no change in the AUC of dabrafenib metabolites. Dabrafenib  is a substrate of human P-
glycoprotein (P- gp) and breast cancer  resistance protein (BCRP) in vitro.  
 
 Clinical activity  
 The single-agent MTD for dabrafenib was not reached. A dose of 150 mg BID was selected for further single -agent development, based on the following PK/pharmacodynamics, safety, and 
activity: a) dose increases beyond 150 mg BID yielded no increase in C
max and <50% increase in 
AUC; b) incidence and severity of AEs was similar at 100 -300 mg BID; c) pERK target 
suppression was >80%; and d) the tumor response rate (RR) was 50% at 150 mg BID.  Activity in patients with BRAF V600E or V600K melanoma in the FTIH monotherapy study 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March 11 , 201 9 
 
15 (BRF112680). The study enrolled 114 patients with BRAFV600 mutant melanoma in the dose 
escalation phase (Part 1), and 70  patients at the RP2D (150 mg BID) in Part 2. Within this study, 
a cohort of 10 patients with previously untreated asymptomatic brain metastasis was evaluated for intracranial response to dabrafenib (Long et al., 2011). All patients had decreases in the size of the brain metastasis; three patients achieved  complete radiographic resolution of brain lesions 
as well as reduction in extracranial  disease. The response rates in patients treated at 150 mg BID 
were 50% in 77 patients treated with V600E mutation, 20% in 14 patients treated with V600K mutation.   When dabrafenib was used at 50 mg BID (Part 2, Cohort C) in patients with BRAFV600E  mutant melanoma, the response rate was only 17%. 
 Correlative studies in the phase 1 monotherapy trial: Preliminary genomic analysis was performed on 37 patients with melanoma, using a Sequenom 
mutation analysis for 11 genes (AKT, BRAF, CDK4, CDKN2A, GNAQ, GNA11, Kit, MEK1, MEK2, and NRAS), and PTEN analysis by [CONTACT_36086], comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and multiplex ligation -dependent probe amplification (MPLA) (Nathanson et al., 2011). 
Nine patients (24%) had PTEN genetic alterations including mutation, hemi-/homozygous deletion. PTEN deficiency was  associated with lower responses (ORR of 11% and 54% in 
patients with  and without PTEN alteration, respectively).  
 Phase III trial of dabrafenib versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced BRAFV600 mutant melanoma (BREAK3 Trial): Patients with previously untreated, unresectable stage III or IV BRAFV600E -mutated  melanoma were randomized (3:1) and stratified by [CONTACT_377486] 
(150 mg PO BID) or dacarbazine (DTIC) (1000 mg/m2, IV, every 3 weeks [Q3W]). Of [ADDRESS_697514] ratio for PFS  was 0.30 (95% CI: 0.18-0.53; P <0.0001), with median PFS of 5.1 months 
for dabrafenib and 2.7 for DTIC. OS data were immature, with 30 deaths reported. Confirmed RR was 53% for dabrafenib and 19% for DTIC. Benefits in PFS and RR were observed in all subgroups evaluated.  
 2.4 Trametinib  
 Trametinib (Mekinist) is a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvate compound (ratio 1:1) with potent, allosteric and ATP non-competitive inhibition of MEK1/2 (IC50 of 0.[ADDRESS_697515] MEK1 and MEK2, respectively) (Gilmartin et al ., 2011). Trametinib inhibited MEK1/2 kinase 
activity  and prevented RAF -dependent MEK phosphorylation (S217 for MEK1), producing 
prolonged pERK1/[ADDRESS_697516] unphosphorylated MEK1/2 (u-MEK1/2) when compared with preactivated diphosphorylated MEK (pp- MEK), 
suggesting that u -MEK affords a higher affinity binding site for trametinib than does pp- MEK.  
 The specificity of trametinib was confirmed against a panel of 183 kinases, including MEK5 (the closet kinase homolog to MEK1/2), CRAF, BRAF, ERK1, and ERK2 (Yamaguchi et al., 2011). Trametinib demonstrated equal potency against activated MEK1 - and MEK2- mediated 
phosphorylation of ERK (sequence identity of 85% across the whole protein and 100% in the active site for human s). Trametinib demonstrated preferential inhibition of RAF -mediated MEK1 
activation (IC50 = 0.60 nM) over pMEK1 kinase activity (IC50 = 13 nM) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2012a).  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March 11 , 201 9 
 
16  
Pharmacodynamic studies were performed in mice treated with trametinib for 14  days (Gilmartin 
et al., 2011). In the A375P F11s xenograft model, the first dose of trametinib (3 mg/kg) significantly reduced pERK for more than 8 hours on Day 1. pERK inhibition was more sustained (over 24 hours) after the Day 7 dose, probably due to an increase in the steady -state 
levels of trametinib after repeated doses. The average Cmax in blood was 1,410 nM on Day 7, with an estimated half -life (t1/2) of 33 hours. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) also 
confirmed inhibition of cell proliferatio n (reduced Ki67) and G1 cell cycle arrest (elevated 
p27Kip1/CDKN1B) following 4 days of treatment.  Trametinib  has been FDA approved for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a 
BRAF V600E  or V600K mutation and is commercially available.  
 
 Pharmacokinetics  
 PK measurements were conducted under fasting conditions. After a single dose (Day 1), AUC0-24 and Cmax values were dose-proportional up to 6 mg, lower than dose proportional following 8 mg, and greater than dose proportional following the 10 mg dose. Median Tmax was 1.5 hours.  After repeat doses (Day 15), trametinib accumulated with a mean accumulation ratio of 6.[ADDRESS_697517] variability in exposure ranged from 27- 50% for Cmax and 20-41% for AUC0 -24 across all dosing regimens. The effective t1/2 was approximately 4.5 days, 
and steady state was reached by [CONTACT_190758] 15. Trametinib had a small peak:trough ratio of ~2 (Infante et al., 2010). At 2 mg QD on Day 15, mean AUC0-24 was 376 ng•h/mL and Cmax 23 ng/mL, and the mean trough concentrations ranged from 10.0 to18.9 ng/mL. The long half-life and small peak:trough ratio of trametinib allowed constant target inhibition within a 
narrow range of exposure.   
 Drug Interactions  
 Trametinib is metabolized predominantly via deacetylation (non -cytochrome P450 [CYP450]-
mediated) with secondary oxidation or in combination with glucuronidation biotransformation pathways (Investigator’s Brochure, 2012a). The deacetylation is likely media ted by [CONTACT_535897], such as carboxylesterases, or amidases. Based on in vitro studies, trametinib is not an 
inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Although trametinib was found to be an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and 2C19; inducer of CYP3A4; and inhibitor of transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, P-glycoprotein [P- gp], and breast cancer 
resistance protein [BCRP]), its low efficacious dose, and low clinical systemic concentration (22.2 ng/mL or 0.04 mcM at 2 mg) relative to the in vitro inhibition/induction potency suggests an overall low potential for drug-drug interactions.  
 Clinical Activity  
 In the FTIH phase 1 trial, 14 patients with BRAF- mutant melanoma received trametinib at 2 mg 
QD (2 mg/day continuously, or 2 mg for 21 days followed by a 1 week break).  The overall objective response rate (ORR) was 43% (6/14), including 2 complete responses (CRs) 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March 11 , 201 9 
 
17 (Investigator's Brochure, 2012a). In 9 patients with BRAF wt melanoma, 2 patients achieved a 
partial response (PR), and 3 stable disease (SD) (Infante et al., 2010). In 26 evaluable pancreatic cancer patients, there were 2 PRs (1 PR was KRAS mutation -positive) and 11 SD (2 achieved 
≥20% tumor reduction) (Messersmith et al., 2011). Among the 27 CRC patients (without selection of R AS or RAF mutations), 8 SD were observed. 
 In a phase 3 trial, patients with unresectable stage IIIC or IV cutaneous melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation were randomized (2:1) to trametinib (2 mg, PO, QD) or chemotherapy (dacarbazine or paclitaxel)  (Flaherty et al. , 2012). There were 322 patients in the 
intention -to-treat (ITT) population, of whom 273 (85%) were in the primary efficacy population 
(patients with BRAFV600E-positive cancer who did not have brain metastases at baseline). In the ITT anal yses, the ORR was 22% in the trametinib group and 8% in the chemotherapy group; 
the median duration of PFS was 4.8 months in the trametinib group as compared with 1.5 months in the chemotherapy group; and the 6- month OS rate was 81% in the trametinib group and 67% in the chemotherapy group.   2.5 Rationale 
 The tumor microenvironment is known to play a role in innate or acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition
29,30. Tumor cells can control the surrounding milieu by [CONTACT_453656] T-cells and recruit immunosuppressive cells, and CSF-1 is one such cytokine that is secreted by [CONTACT_453657]. CSF -1 induces the proliferation and differentiation of 
immunosuppressive myeloid cells, such as M2 polarized macrophages and myeloid -derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs), by [CONTACT_38220]-1R on the surface of the cell. This results in the ability of  the tumor cell to evade the immune response and allows for subsequent metastasis
31.  
 Pre-clinical data by [CONTACT_453658]. showed a dramatic reduction in tumor infiltrating myeloid cells 
when treated with CSF -1R inhibition.  When this was combined with BRAF inhibition superior 
antitumor responses and increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were observed
31. Inhibitors to 
CSF-1R have been shown to deplete certain populations of TAMs and in established tumors, the 
combination of CSF-1R inhibitors with chemotherapy has been shown to dramatically  enhance 
responses32.  
 Additional pre -clinical data from Wang et al. demonstrated that macrophages play a role in 
resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy through paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway leading to increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ).  Targeting 
macrophages in a pre- clinical model led to increased tumor activity of BRAF inhibition in mouse 
and human tumor models
33. These data together suggest that targeting macrophages in 
combination with BRAF inhibition in patients with melanoma may reduce baseline resistance and increase efficacy.  Prior BRAF inhibition has also been shown to lead to increased TAMs, 
suggesting a potential role of combination therapy in patients with acquired resistance
34. 
 2.6 Correlative Studies Background  
 Use of immune and targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_535878] a variety of confounding variables that could contribute to success or failure of the therapy.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March [ADDRESS_697518] points enables addressing of key questions including : (1) the genomic lesions and immune cell presence at baseline in samples studied and 
their potential impact u pon response, (2) the identification of immediate pathways/gene 
expression programs activated by [CONTACT_535898]110 combination therapy , and (3) 
mechanisms of acquired resistance to therapy.  
 The first correlative question relates to the gen etic and immune diversity of the patients enrolled 
in this study. It is the anticipation that most patients on this study will have had their tumor genomically characterized by [CONTACT_535899]/BWH (a custom hybrid capture panel which via next -gener ation sequencing will identify mutations and copy -number alterations 
in cancer associated genes) or via another CLIA -certified method at the time of enrollment. The 
archival tissue collected will be analyzed to look at the TAMs present at baseline. Macrophages are among the most abundant normal cells in the tumor micoenvironment. Substantial evidence has indic ated that macrophages adopt a pro-tumoral phenotype, suppressing T cell response and 
promoting tumor progression via angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion, motility, intravasation, and promotion of persistent gr owth
32. The levels of certain  TAMs present at baseline can be 
correlated to the clinical response observed with the combination therapy, and this data may  
enable us to identify immune characteristics that may  also impact clinical response . 
 Another key rationale for performance of biopsies in patients after initiating drug therapy is to address mechanisms of resistance to  MCS110 combination therapy.  The emergence of 
resistance to therapy is a profound problem in oncology.  Such resistance can follow not only acquisition of secondary mutations but also from the ability of cancer cells to activate immediate compensatory signaling tracts following targeted inhibition of a key pathway
39. Identification of 
these compensatory reactions is a necessary step in order to design subsequent rational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_535879]- lasting clinical benefit. The optional on- treatment 
tissue samples will be examined  for changes in MAPK activation as w ell as levels of TAMs  and 
tumor immune infiltrates.  
 Optional biopsies obtained at the time of disease progression will be used to characterize the change in the tumor at the time of resistance.  Such changes could stem from the acquisition of novel genomi c alterations , from activation of other signaling pathways, or the production of anti-
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March 11 , 201 9 
 
19 inflammatory and immunosuppressive mediators. Biopsies obtained at progression will be 
analyzed for MAPK reactivation, other mechanisms of resistance (e.g.,  alternate kinase domain 
mutations), and tumor immune infiltrates.  The information collected from these biopsies will be 
vital to understanding the methods of resistance to the combination therapy and planning subsequent treatment strategies in this population.  Collect ion of Blood 
 Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) will be collected and analyzed for BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. 
Levels of tumor DNA will decline  longitudinally over time if there is a response to the treatment 
administered. To further assess this concept , plasma will be collect ed from participants to 
evaluate whether circulating free plasma DNA declines with the administration of MCS110, 
dabrafenib , and trametinib  and this information will be compared to clinical outcome.  
 Blood samples will also be collected to look at circulating immune cells including MDSCs. MDSCs are a heterogeneous group of myeloid- derived cells which are greatly expanded in 
experimental models of cancer . Studies in humans carried out thus far have reported an increased 
frequency as well as immune -suppressive activity in some of the myeloid-derived subsets of 
MDSCs present in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer . In the case of metastatic 
melanoma, both monocytic as well as granulocytic blood MDSCs with immune-suppressive function have been studied independently and proposed to exert an immune-regulatory role
40. To 
further explore the relationship of circulating immune cells including MDSCs and their potential correlation to clinical outcome s, peri pheral blood levels will be serially collected from patients 
enrolled to the trial.

REGISTRATION PROCEDU RES  
  4.1 
General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions  
 Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) OnCore . Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of protocol therapy. Any participant not 
registered to the protocol before protocol therapy begins will be considered ineligible and 
registration will be denied.  
 An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the 
protocol- specific eligibility checklist.  
 Following registration, participants  may begin protocol therapy . Issues that would cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the pa rticipant’s registration on the 
study must be canceled . Registration cancellations  must be made in OnCore as soon as possible.

The maximally administered dose (MAD)  of the study medications  will be defined  as the dose 
level where at least two  participants develop toxicities consistent with a  DLT  definition. In this 
situation, the dose level immediately below the MAD will be defined as the  MTD.  In the event 
that dose level 1 is found to be intolerable (with either 2/3 or ≥ 2/6 patients experiencing a DLT), the fallback dose level -[ADDRESS_697533] ≥ [ADDRESS_697534] dose administered (i.e . dose level 3). The MTD w ill be 
defined in a minimum of six  patients . 
 Upon declar ing the MTD, the Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_535881] [ADDRESS_697535] progressed on prior BRAF/MEK inhibition. Patients enrolling into the 
phase II portion of the trial will be treated at the RP2D identified during the phase I portion of the study.  Patients enrolled to the phase I dose escalation portion of the trial will be required to have 
received at least [ADDRESS_697536] cycle to be considered evaluable for DLT purposes. Patients who do not meet these parameters during cycle 1 for reasons other than toxicity (for example, withdrawal of consent for participation on the trial, or rapid disease progression and subsequent removal from the trial) will be replaced.  
 Participants will be requested to maintain a study medication diary that will indicate each dose of oral medication taken to illustrate treatment compliance. The medication diary should be returned to appropriate research staff for review at the end of each treatment cycle.

Agent Administration  
 
 MCS110 
 
MCS110 will be given once on day 1 of the 21 day cycle . On days where MCS110, 
dabrafenib , and trametinib  are all to be given , order of administration does not matter.  
 MCS110 will be administered via IV infusion.   Mild infusion reactions were reported in 2 patients in the MCS110A2101 study, where all symptoms (dizziness, chills, hypotension) resolved within [ADDRESS_697540] any infusion reactions during subsequent infusions. Patients should be monitored for hypersensitivity reactions according to local guidelines. Appropriate treatment for hypersensitivity reactions should be available at bedside and a physician readily available. Prophylaxis to prevent infusion reactions is only recommended for subsequent doses in patients who previously experienced an infusion reaction to MCS110.  
 
A pharmacy manual will be provided with details on how to administer MCS110 
 
 Dabrafenib  
Dabrafenib  will be given as per package instructions. Dabrafenib  should be taken orally 
every 12 hours. A missed dose can be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next dose. Doses that would be administered outside of that timeframe should be considered missed and should not be taken. Tablets should not be crushed or chewed. A vomited dose should not be retaken, patients should continue with the next scheduled dose. Dabrafenib  should be 
taken orally with approximately 200 mL of water under fasted conditions ( an empty 
stomach either one hour be fore or two hours after a meal).  Do not replace water with 
juice (especially not orange, grapefruit or other fruit juic es), soda or other beverages.  On 
days where MCS110, dabrafenib , and trametinib  are all to be given, order of 
administration does not matter.  
 
 Trametinib  
 
Trametinib  will be given as per package instructions. Trametinib  should be taken orall y 
daily . A missed dose can be taken up to 12 hours prior to the next dose. Doses that would 
occur outside of this timeframe should be considered missed and should not be taken. Tablets should not be crushed or chewed. A vomited dose should not be retaken, patients 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March 11 , 201 9 
 
28 should continue with the next scheduled dose. Trametinib  can be taken with or without 
food.  Trametinib should be taken with a cup of water (approximately 200 mL of water).  
Do not replace water with juice (especially not orange, grapefruit or other fruit juic es), 
soda or other beverages.  On days where MCS110, dabrafenib , and trametinib  are all to 
be given, order of administration does not matter.  
 5.4 
Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  (DLT)   
 Dose -limiting toxicity is based on version 4.0 of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria fo r 
Adverse Events (CTCAE). DLT refers to toxicities experienced during the first cycle of treatment  that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the  study medication regimen . A 
DLT will be defined as follows:  
• ≥ Grade 3 non- hematological toxicity. Exceptions will be made for:  
• Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation that can be controlled with appropriate care. Grade 3 and grade 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation should be considered a DLT if persi sting more than 48 hours despi[INVESTIGATOR_453620]. 
• Grade 3 rash or photosensitivity lasting fewer than 8 days, or that can be controlled with appropriate care. Grade 3 rash or photosensitivity should be considered a DLT if it persists for mo re than 8 days and cannot be managed despi[INVESTIGATOR_535882]. 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding  
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
• ≥ Grade 3 febrile neutropenia  
• Grade 4 anemia  
• Holding of any study medication due to toxicity for a period of greater than [ADDRESS_697541] cycle. 
• Any other significant toxicity deemed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_535883] (for example, any toxicity that is  at least  possibly related  to the study medication  regimen  that 
results in  the withdrawal of the patient from the study during c ycle 1).  
 Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are outlined in Section 6 . 
 5.5 
General Concomitant Medi cation and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 In general, concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_217905] (e.g. such as anti -emetics, anti -diarrhea) and safety of the patient are allowed. The administration of 
bisphosphonates is per mitted.  
 Subjects should receive full supportive care during the study, including transfusions of blood and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics, anti- emetics, anti -diarrheals, and analgesics, and 
other care as deemed appropriate, and in accordan ce with their institutional guidelines.  Use of 
anticoagulants such as warfarin is permitted however, caution should be exercised and additional 
International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring is recommended when dabrafenib is used 
concomitantly with warfa rin. 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March [ADDRESS_697542] be told to notify the investigational site about any new medications, herbal remedies and dietary supplements he/she takes after the start of the study treatment. All medications (other than study treatment) and significant non- drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical 
therapy, herbal/natural medications and blood transfusions) administered during the study must be listed in the subject’s study records. Prior antineoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_217906], radiotherapy, and surgery are also to be recorded. Medication entries should be specific to trade name, dose and unit, the frequency and route of administration, the start and discontinuation date and the reason for therapy. Radiation skin injury has been reported with concurrent use of dabrafenib and radiation. It is recommended that dabrafenib be held for seven days before and two days after XRT in subjects receiving dabrafenib monotherapy or in combination with trametinib. These recommendations can be modified based on the physician’s ass essment of the risk of radiation skin injury. 
  
 MCS110 Guidelines  
 
Anticoagulation is permitted if the patients are already at stable doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for >[ADDRESS_697543] dose. However, ongoing anticoagulant therapy should be temporarily discontinued to allow tumor biopsy according to the institutional guidelines.  Statins should be used with caution since CK elevations are commonly seen. 
 
Any other anticancer or investigational treatment is not permitted while on study treatment. Additionally, other biologics (e.g.: antibodies and proteins) and immunosuppressive medication are not permitted while on this study.  
 Concomitant chronic corticosteroids (≥10 mg of prednisone or equivalent) are not allowed.  
 Treatment with hematopoietic colony -stimulating growth factors (e.g. G -CSF), may not be 
initiated unless the investigator deems it necessary.   The use of live vaccines is not allowed through the whole duration of the study.  5.6 
Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Protoco l Therapy  
 Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue 
indefinitely or until one of the following criteria applies : 
 
• Disease progression , unless the patient is deriving clinical benefit as agreed upon with 
the principal investigator 
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  including those described in Sections 5.4 and Section 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656

• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the oral 
medication regimen and/or documentation requirements 
 
• Participant decides to withdraw from the protocol therapy 
 
• General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participan t 
unacceptable for further treatment in t he judgment of the treating investigator 
 Participants  will be removed from the protocol therapy when any of the se criteria apply.  The 
reaso n for removal from protocol therapy, and the date the participant was rem oved, must be 
documented in the case report f orm (CRF) . Alternative care options will be discussed with the 
participant.  
 When a participant is removed from protocol therapy and/or is off of the study, the relevant Off-Treatment/Off -Study information will be updated in OnCore. 
 In the event of unusual or life- threatening complications, treating investigators must immediately 
notify the Overall PI, [CONTACT_453683] at DFCI pager number [ZIP_CODE].    5.[ADDRESS_697544] with care providers, and/or telephone contact [CONTACT_453666] 3-4 months.   5.8 
Criteria for Ta king a Participant Off Study  
 Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria apply: 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Withdrawal of consent for data submission 
• Death  
 The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant w as rem oved, must be 
documented in the case report f orm (CRF) . 
 For Centralized Subject Registrations, the research team submits a completed Off Treatment/Off Study form to ODQ when a participant comes off study. This form can be found on the ODQ website or obtained from the ODQ registration staff.

 Treatment with dabrafenib has been associated with the development of uveitis, including iritis. Monitor patients for visual signs and symptoms (such as, change in vision, photophobia and eye pain) during therapy. Special attention should be given to retinal findings (e.g., retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_6678] (RPED)  or retinovascular abnormalities  (i.e., branch or central retinal vein 
occlusi ons (RVO ).  For events of visual changes ( regardless of severity ) for which an ophthalmic 
examination is conducted, a blood sample for PK analysis must be drawn as close as possible to the time of the event.  Guidelines regarding management and dose reduction for visual changes

Protocol Version Date: March [ADDRESS_697552] should be instructed to take anti- pyretics (e.g.  ibuprofen or 
acetaminophen/paracetamol)  as appropriate to control fever.  The use of oral corticosteroids 
should be considered in those instances in which anti- pyretics are insufficient. Monitor serum

Study medications may be held independently of each other if toxicity is felt by [CONTACT_535902] (e.g., a patient may continue 
to receive their MCS110 on schedule while holding their dabrafenib  and/or trametinib ). 
 If the study medication(s) is/are placed on hold for toxicity, the counting of cycle days  and 
assessment schedule will continue without interruption  (including tumor evaluations). For 
example, a patient who does not receive their cycle 2 day 1 infusion of MCS110 due to toxicity will proceed with their next scheduled infusion and visit (cycle 3 day 1).  Additional interim visits 
will be conducted as clinically necessary  to manage toxicity . The cycle will not restart for dosing 
delays due to toxicity.  Exception s to this are possible for significant treatment delays (≥ 2 weeks) 
after a discussion with the principal investigator. 
  6.[ADDRESS_697554] include a reduction in MCS110 unless the toxicity is clearly causes by [CONTACT_535903] . Further d ose reductions will be based on the offending medication (s) according to the 
schedule outlined in table 20. In the event the treating  investigator feels all three medications  are 
responsible for the toxicity, all medications can  be reduced. Dose reductions below 25 mg once 
per week of MCS110 will not be permitted.  Reductions below 50 mg BID of dabrafenib or 1 mg 
daily of trametinib  will not be permitted.   
 A maximum of two dose reductions will be allowed with any one of the medications. If a patient requires more than two dose reductions with any one of the study medications, they should be discontinued from protocol therapy. Exceptions are possible in the event a patient is not tolerating the dabrafenib  and/or trametinib  despi[INVESTIGATOR_453626]. In this circumstance, a patient may be allowed to continue on protocol therapy and receive MCS110 either alone or in combination with just the dabrafenib  or trametinib  if 
agreed upon with the princi pal investigator.  
 Patients undergoing dose reductions for toxicities may not be re- escalated.

Overdose management  
 There are no known antidotes for over-dosage of MCS110, dabrafenib , or trametinib . In the case 
of suspected overdose, monitor hematologic parameters, serum chemistry, vital signs, cardiac function, and provide supportive care as necessary. 
 
In the event of a dabrafenib overdose, defined as administration of more than 300 mg as a single dose or 600 mg per day (the highest dose tested in clinical studies to date), and/or a trametinib overdose, defined as administration of more than 3.0 mg once daily (the maximum toler ated dose 
defined in the MEK111054 Study), the investigator should contact [CONTACT_535904]/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities.  
NOVARTIS  does not recommend specific treatment.  The investigator will use clinical judgment 
to treat any overdose.  Haemodialysis is not expected to enhance the elimination of either 
dabrafenib or trametinib as both are highly bound to plasma proteins. 
 Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by [CONTACT_535905]. 
A plasma sample for PK analysis may be requested by [CONTACT_535906] a case -
by-case basis.  This plasma sample should be col lected as soon as possible, but within [ADDRESS_697568] dose of on-study dosing. Information regarding the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing should be documented in the eCRF.

47 7.4 Serious Adverse Events  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any adverse event during this study that results in one of the 
following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333191] 24 hours 
• Prolonging an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• A life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Considered significant by [CONTACT_81121] 
 
• All events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia defined as 
ALT ≥ 3xULN and  bilirubin ≥  2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT ≥  3xULN and INR>1.5, 
if INR measured) or termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR measurement is not required and 
the threshold value stated will not apply to patients receiving anticoagulants).  
NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. If testing is unavailable and a subject meets the 
criterion of total bilirubin ≥  2xULN, then the event is still reported as an SAE. If INR is 
obtained, include values on the SAE form. INR elevations >1.[ADDRESS_697572] severe liver injury. 
• Any new primary cancers and treatment emergent malignancies (including squamous 
cell carcinoma and n ew primary melanoma) with the exception of basal cell carcinoma 
(BCC).  BCC should be reported as an AE or SAE based on the discretion of the investigator.  
• Symptomatic LVEF  decrease that meets stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_535891].  
• Retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_6678] (RPED) or retinal vein occlusion (RVO) 
 Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form ) surgeries , and non- disease 
related elective surgeries  planned during the course of the study, should not be reported as SAEs 
unless the underlying medical condition has worsened or appeared during the course of the study.  
 Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249054] ’s medical history at the time  of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16500] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] ( e.g., for

Exploratory Fresh Tumor Biopsies  
 Optional fresh tumor biopsies will be obtained from patients enrolled during either phase of the trial, as described in Section 2.6 – Correlative Studies. The biopsies will only be obtained if the treating investigator believes the biopsy to be clinically feasible and if the patient is willing to undergo the biopsy procedures.   The optional on- treatment biopsy can be collected  anytime between Cycle [ADDRESS_697581] dose of MCS110.  Core biopsy samples should be obtained for analysis. Three- to-four biopsy passes utilizing a 16-
18 gauge needle are preferable, but a 20 gauge core needle biopsy is also acceptable. Less than the goal amount of tissue is acceptable for the biopsy procedures, and should be based upon the clinical judgment of the treating investigator and the clinician performing the procedure.  
 Biopsy samples should be formalin -fixed and paraffin embedded per institutional standards.

  [ADDRESS_697603] – Solid Tumors  
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international c riteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca  45:221-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
 Definitions  
 
Evaluable for Target Disease response.  Only those participants who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for target disease response.  These 
participants will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Participants  who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 
will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response.  Participants  who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of meas urable disease, have 
received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for non- target disease.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter   to be recorded) as ≥  [ADDRESS_697604] x -ray or ≥[ADDRESS_697605] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 Note : Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will not be 
considered measurable.   
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathol ogically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_697606] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March 11 , 201 9 
 
62 Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered  
non-measurable.  
 Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and  measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend its elf 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calcula ted and reported 
as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions.  All othe r lesions (or sites of disease)  including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow up.  
 
 Metho ds for Evaluation of Disease 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in m etric not ation using a ruler, calipers , 
or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March 11 , 201 9 
 
63 followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm in diame ter as 
assessed using calipers  (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray.  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined an d surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]; however, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is  also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be perform ed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 
FDG -PET. While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
(a) Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. (b)  No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the posit ive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
PD.  If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow- up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progr ession occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
imag es, this is not PD. 
(c)  FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]- specific medical 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March [ADDRESS_697607] be acknowledged that both approaches 
may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
PET- CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bi as an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
MIBG (meta -iodobenzylguanidine) .The following is recommended, to assure high 
quality images are obtained.  
Patient preparation: Iodides, usually SSKI (saturated solution of potassium iodide), are administered to reduce thyroidal accumulation of free radioiodine, preferably beginning the day prior to injection and continuing for 3 additional days (4 days total).  For infants and children,  one drop t.i.d. is sufficient, for adolescents 2 drops 
t.i.d., and for adults 3 drops t.i.d. Participants  and/or parents are asked about exposure 
to potential interfering agents. If none is noted, an indwelling intravenous line i s 
established. The dose of MIBG is administered by [CONTACT_67481] 90 seconds.  
Images from the head to the distal lower extremities should be obtained.  
I-123MIBG scintigraphy is performed to obtain both planar and tomographic images.  
Planar: Anterior and posterior views from the top of the head to the proximal lower 
extremities are obtained for 10 minutes at 24 hours and occasionally at 48 hours following injection of 10 mCi/1.7 square meters of body surface area (~150 μCi/kg, maximum 10 mCi). Anterior views of the distal lower extremities are adequate. A large field of view dual head gamma camera with low energy collimators is preferred.  
 SPECT: Most participants  receiving I -[ADDRESS_697608]/CT m ay be performed at institutions with this capacity.  
 
Ultrasound. Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March [ADDRESS_697609] in selected instances.   
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy . The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers . Tumor markers alone cann ot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  
26:1148-1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_697610] -line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 
Cytology, Histology . These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.

Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient

study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or  more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator). 
 [IP_ADDRESS] 
Evaluation of New Lesions  
 The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or 
flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), fol low-up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started , or 
death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last 
disease evaluation ).

time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease 
is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation .  
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from th e start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
 Progression -Free Survival  
 
Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or 
registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive. 
 
Progression-Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation. 
 
Time to Progression: Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to progression, or censored at date of last disease evaluation for those without progression reported.

Data Safety Monitoring 
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  17-656 
Protocol Version Date: March 11 , 201 9 
 
69 The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity 
and accrual data from this study . The committee is composed of clinical specialists with 
experience in oncology and who have no dire ct relationship with the study. Information that 
raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  
 The DSMC will review each protocol up to four times a year or more often if required to review toxicity and accrual data. Information to be provided to the committee may include: up- to-date 
participant accrual; current dose level information; DLT information; all grade [ADDRESS_697614] been reported; summary of all deaths occur ring with 30 
days of intervention for Phase I or II protocols; for gene therapy protocols, summary of all deaths while being treated and during active follow-up; any response information; audit results, and a summary provided by [CONTACT_3476]. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be provided upon request.   
 
11.[ADDRESS_697615] 3+3 design is planned for the dose finding phase I portion of the trial. The phase I portion of the trial will require a minimum of  six and a maximum of 18 patients to determine the 
MTD and RP2D. Following identification of the MTD  and RP2D, a single-a rm phase II trial will 
commence. A  total of 25 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF V600E or V600K 
mutation  will be enrolled to the phase II portion of the trial.

70 therapy, all available response designations contributed to the objective response determination.  
 
Secondary Endpoint s: 
 Progression-free and overall survival are defined in Section 10.1.5.  Toxicity will be assessed using the CTCAE version 4.0.  Design:  
 
Phase I 
A conventional algorithm (3+3 design) will be used to identify the MTD, escalating on 0/3 or 1/[ADDRESS_697616] dose level at 
which 0/3 or 1/6 subjects experience a DLT. If dose level 1 is discovered to be intolerable (with 2/3 or ≥ 2/6 subjects experiencing a DLT), the trial will proceed with enrollment to the fallback 
dose level of -1. If the fallback dose level is also found to be intolerable, the trial will be 
discontinued. The probabilities of escalation if  the true but unknown DLT rates are 10, 20, 30, 
40, and 50% are 91, 71, 49, 31, and 17%, respectively.   
Phase II  
The design of the phase II trial will be based on the endpoint of ORR.    A Simon, two- stage design with a total of 25 patients will be used.  For this we assume a 
desirable response rat e of 20% and a null rate of 1%. We will enroll [ADDRESS_697617] response, then we will conclude that there is evidence of adequate response in this cohort.  If the true response rate is 1%, the probability is 0.[ADDRESS_697618] stage.  The power of this design is 95% with a type -I error of 0.02 (target 0.1).

Analysis of Primary and Secondary  Endpoints  
 The primary and secondary analyses will include all eligible patients who started assigned therapy. The phase II evaluation s will not include the patients enrolled in  the phase I portion of 
this trial (see above for statistical analysis plan) . The exception to this includes the planned 
analysis of toxicity data, which will include all patients who received study drug regardless of eligibility.   
 Phase I:  The proportion of patients with DLTs will be summarized by [CONTACT_42376].  Phase II:  The primary endpoint of ORR will be summarized and presented with a 95% confidence interval estimated using the method of Atkinson and Brown, which allows for the two-stage design.  PFS and OS will be summarized using the method of Kaplan- Meier.   Medians 
and PFS/OS estimates at pre -specified time points will be summarized and presented with 95% 
confidence intervals based on log(- log(endpoint)) methods. 
 Exploratory Endpoints: Data from correlative studies will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Associations to clinical outcome between MAPK sign aling, TAMs, and immune infiltrates  will be compared and 
summarized by [CONTACT_535911].  Additionally, tumor DNA levels obtained from the serial collection of cfDNA samples will be examined to explore whether clinical outcome correlates to fluctuations following the administration of MCS110 combination therapy.

 Evaluation of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
 
All eligible participants included in the study will be assessed for response, even if there are major protocol therapy deviations. Each participant should be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not a ssessable, 
insufficient data). By [CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the "unknown" status of any type of data in a clinical database.

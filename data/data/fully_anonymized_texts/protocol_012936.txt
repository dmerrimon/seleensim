 4 INTRODUCTION  
 Age-Related Macular Degeneration  
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an aging disease characterized by [CONTACT_814917], a small area in the central portion of the retina,  
responsible for central vision.   AMD is characteristically a disease of the elderly and is the 
leading cause of visual loss  in individuals >  50 years of age in developed countries  (Van 
Newkirk et al., 2000) .  In the [LOCATION_002], it is estimated that approximately 11 million  
individuals are affected with AMD  with a global prevalence of 170 million individuals  
(Pennington  et al., 2016 ).  Because of increasing life expectancy in developed and developi[INVESTIGATOR_18504], the elderly sector of the general population is expected to increase at the greatest 
rate in coming decades  (Ortma & Velkof, 2014) .  While 1 in  8 Americans was considered to be 
elderly in 1994, it is expected that 1 in  5 will fall into this category by  2030 (Day, 1993; Hobbs,  
et al., 1996 ).  Projections based on U.S. Census Bureau data suggest that  the number of 
Americans over the age of 65 will more than double, increasing it to 80 million by [CONTACT_814918] (Day, 1993) .  In the absence of adequate prevention or treatment measures, the 
number of cases of AMD with visual loss is expected to grow in parallel with the aging population, leading to a major public health challenge with significant socioeconomic 
implications (M itchell et. al ., 2018).  
AMD , at its early stages, present s with drusen and abnormalities of retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] 
(RPE).  As the disease progresses  with age  to the advanced stage, it generally progresses to 
either  the non-neovascular ( “atrophic, dry”) form of AMD or the neovascular ( “wet or 
exudative” ) form of the disease (Mitchell et. al ., 2018).   In the dry, atrophic f orm, loss of 
photoreceptors, RPE cells and associated capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037] (choriocapi[INVESTIGATOR_167583]) in the macula  result in 
marked thinning and/ or atrophy of retinal tissue.  This collective phenotype in the advanced 
stage of dry AMD is termed geographic atrophy (GA) (Holz et al, 2014) .  Furthermore, 
development or progression of geographic atrophy over time is a common cause of vision loss 
in pat ients diagnosed with the wet form of advanced AMD who are treated with anti -VEGF 
therapy, indicating that in many patients regardless of having the dry or the wet form of AMD, the final anatomic outcome leading to loss of vision is geographic atrophy (Bhis itkul et al., 
2015; Grunwald et al., 2017; Abdelfatah et al., 2016).  
 
Geographic atrophy is a significant cause of bilateral, irreversible and severe loss of functional 
vision , with a potential los s on average of [ADDRESS_1128093] on functional vision, quality of life, and independence (Mitchell et al., 201 8; 
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page 12                               2 4May2021 Confidential  
 Sivaprasad et al., 2019; Boyer et al. 2017, AREDS Report Number 26, 2009).  The median 
time for development of central geographic atrophy from the time of diagnosis is 2.5 years with 
an expectancy of develop ment  in the fellow eye in approximately  7 years (AREDS Report 
Number 26, 2009).  
Although anti -VEG F therapy is available for  treatment of wet AMD , currently no Food and Drug 
Administration (F DA) or European Medicines Agency ( EMA)  approved treatment is available 
for geographic atrophy  (Brown et al., 2006; Rosenfeld et al, 2006; Heier et al., 2012;  Martin et 
al., 2012; Boyer et al. 2017 ).  
The absence of treatment options for geographic atrophy secondary to AMD represents  an 
area of urgent  unmet medical need and a major public health concern for the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_814901].   
 
 AMD and the Complement Pathway  
Although t he etiology of AMD is not completely understood (Frederick & Kleinman, 2014) , 
recognized risk factors include advanced age, environmental and genetic factors , ocular 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], dietary factors, family history for AMD, hypertension, and smoking (Klein et al., 
2004) .  
The scientific rationale for the role of complement in AMD is derived from genetic linkage 
studies, pre-clinical in vitro studies, and the presen ce of complement deposition in post -mortem 
human eyes of patient s diagnosed with AMD.  
The role for complement  in development of AMD is highlighted by [CONTACT_814919], which suggest that approximately 50% of AMD cases show  polymorphism 
in complement regulatory proteins compared to age- matched controls  (Edwards et al., 2005; 
Hageman et al., 2005; Haines et al., 2005; Klein et al., 2005; Narayanan et al ., 2007) .  
Furthermore, polymorphism in genes coding for complement or complement regulatory 
proteins confer an  increased risk in age- related macular degeneration.  In individuals 
homozygous for the risk allele, the likelihood of AMD is increased by a factor of 7.4 (K lein et 
al., 2005).  
The complement cascade,  which was originally described over a century ago by [CONTACT_814920] , 
represents  a critical portion  of the innate immune system , involving a complex system of over 
50 serum proteins  (Ehrlich et al. , 1899; Holers, 2014; Arbore et al., 2016; Kolev et a l., 2014 ).  
In addition to its role in the innate immune system, recent studies indicate that  complement 
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page 13                               2 4May2021 Confidential  
 may also play a role in the adaptive immune system, cell and tissue development, homeostasis  
and repair (Kolev et a l., 2014).  
The complement cascade is activated via the classical (antibody -dependent), the alternative 
(antibody -independent) , and the lectin pathways  (Holers, 2014) .  The thr ee cascades converge 
to generate  the complement C3 convertase  which cleaves complement C3 and leads to 
subsequent generation of complement C5 convertase which cleaves complement C5 into C5a 
and C5b, the main terminal effector  comp onents  of the complement cascade,  leading to cell 
death.  
 
C5a: Inflammasome Activation  and Cell Degeneration  
Inflammasomes are  critical component s of the innate immune system (Swanson et al., 2019).  
NLRP3 (NOD- , LRR - and pyrin domain- containing protein 3) is an intracellular sensor that 
detects a broad range of endogenous danger signals and environmental irritants, resulting in 
the formation and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Swanson et al., 2019).  
Inflammasome activation leads to pyroptosis, a rapid inflammatory form of lytic programmed 
cell death ( Swanson et al. 2019). It is characterized by [CONTACT_814921], increased osmotic pressure, cell swelling and subsequent plasma membrane rupture and release of pro- inflammatory intracellul ar contents (Fink et al., 2006).   The 
extracellular release of pro- inflammatory content may further advance the spreading of 
damage in nei ghboring cells, leading to the progression of the pathology (Bergsbaken et al., 
2009).   
NLRP3 inflammasomes generally require two signals for  activation: Signal [ADDRESS_1128094] danger, a functional cross talk between the two would appear to be 
natural.  
Complement factor C5a is an important driver of Signal 1 priming for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and may regulate NLRP3 activ ation and assembly  by [CONTACT_814922] (ROS)  (Arbore et al., 2016) . 
Human RPE cells express both C3a and C5a receptors which bind to C3a and C5a 
respectively ; however, after incubation with activated complement  only C5aR (and not C3aR ) 
is upregulated  (Cortight et al., 2009; Brandstetter et al., 2015).  In response to lipofuscin 
toxici ty, C5a leads to an increased IL- 1ß secretion a nd a  decreas e in RPE cell viability , 
suggesting its role as active priming agent for inflammasomes in RPE cells  (Brandstetter et al., 
2015) . 
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page [ADDRESS_1128095] -mortem eyes of patients 
with geographic atrophy  (Tarallo et al., 2012 and Cao et al., 2016) .  These findings support the 
rationale for therapeutic complement C5 inhibition in AMD, since C5 activation and C5a 
formation may serve as the link between lipofuscin accumulation, photooxidative damage and 
inflammasome formation leading to RPE degeneration in AMD (Brandstetter et al., 2015).   The 
pyroptosis result ing from inflammasome activation may be a contributing factor in t he 
progression of GA in patients with AMD.  
 
C5b: Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) Formation  and Cell Degeneration  
One hallmark of AMD is the accumulation of lipofuscin  granules  inside the aging RPE cells  
(Feeney -Burns et al., 1984).  Accumulation of lipof uscin may lead to the activation of 
complement system  and accumulation of membrane attack complex (MAC) in RPE cells, 
potentially contributing to their  deterioration over time and resulting in photorecepto r cell loss 
and decrease in vision (Zhou et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2009 ; Lenis et al., 2017 ).  Lipofuscin and 
MAC  complex have a damaging effect on RPE cell function by [CONTACT_814923] (Georgiannakis et al., 2015 ).   
Photo- oxidation of lipof uscin in RPE cells activates the complement cascade in vitro  and 
potentially could contribute to complement activation in the RPE -Bruchs membrane interface 
(Zhou et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2009 ).  Bisretinoid pi[INVESTIGATOR_814902] A2E we re 
also capable of activating the complement system in RPE cells ( Zhou et al., 2009) . 
As indicated above, the activation of complement cascade results in the formation of MAC.  In 
RPE cells MAC is cleared by [CONTACT_814924] (Georgiannakis et 
al., 2015) .  Lipofuscin accumulation leads to lysosomal dysfunction in RPE cells.   This prevent s 
the clearance of MAC and leads  to its further accumulation , inducing cellular distress (Schutt 
et al., 2002, Bergmann et al., 2004, Georgiannakis et al., 2015) .  These findings indicate that 
lipofuscin  not only activates the complement system but may also prevent the clearance of 
MAC  in RPE cells, creating a vicious cycle that makes RPE cells further  susceptible to 
complement activation.  
The accumulation of MAC not only impacts lysosomes but also leads to mitochondrial perturbation in RPE cells (Georgiannakis et al., 2015) .  MAC  accumulation leads to a significant 
decrease in the quantitative number of mitochondria as a function of area and induces ultrastructural defects i.e. smaller size, rounder morphology, and fewer cristae.   These changes 
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C  Page [ADDRESS_1128096] on the energy production and subsequently the function 
of RPE cells.  In addition, the accumulation of lipofusc in inside RPE cells impacts the 
mitochondria as well.  Mitochondria are significantly more sensitive to lipofus cin when 
compared to lysosomes and their latency decreases at a  lower concentration and a shorter 
period of time (Schutt et al., 2002) .  Further, accumulation of MAC leads to the complete lysis 
and destruction of RPE cells in a concentration- dependent manner (Li et al., 2010).  
Taken together, the accumulation of lipofuscin  and MAC synergistically damage both 
lysosomes and mitochondria inside the RPE cells, leading to their dysfunction  and death.  To 
further substantiate the role of C5 and MAC in AMD, post mortem histopathologic studies demonstrated their presence in the drusen and RPE cells of  patients with AMD  (Anderson et 
al., 2002; Bok 2005).  
These findings indicate that the activation of complement pathway , contributing to the 
formation of inflammasome and accumulation of MAC, may play an important  role in 
geographic atrophy , and therefore inhibition of C5 may potentially slow progression of this 
devastating disease.  Positive efficacy res ults from  the recently reported clinical trials  
assessing the impact of complement inhibition in geographic atrophy  may further validate  the 
therapeutic role of comp lement inhibition in  GA (Liao et al., 2019; OPH2003) .

 Clinical Data 
4.3.1  Study OPH2000  
In a phase 1 ascending dose and parallel group clinical trial , the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetic profile of multiple intravitreal  injections of Zimura  in combination with 
Lucentis® 0.5 mg was evaluated in patients  with wet AMD (OPH 2000).  
Zimura  was well- tolerated and no particular safety concerns were i dentified.   
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  There 
was a trend towards a mean increase in VA (number of ETDR S letters) from B aseline at all 
time points for patients in the 0.3, 1 and 2 mg dose groups in the TN subgroup who received 
6 injections.  At Week 24, there was an improvement in mean VA from B aseline of  
15.3 ETDRS 
letters for the 2 mg dose group.    
   
 
   
 
4.3.2  Study OPH2001  
An additional  phase 1 study was performed in patients  diagnosed with geographic atrophy

 (GA).   
Patients  received treatment with [ADDRESS_1128097] safety assessments were performed for ophthalmic variables 
that included VA, IOP, ophthalmic examination, f undus autofluorescence (FAF), f luorescein  
angiography (FA), and spectral -domain optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT) together with 
adverse events ( AEs), vital signs, and laboratory variables.  
Fifteen 
patients  (32%) had AEs, predominantly Eye Disorder AEs in the study eye, reported  to be 
related to the injection procedure.  The most frequently reported AEs were conjunctival 
hemorrhage (4 patients , 9%), corneal edema (4 patients , 9%), and dry eye (3 patients , 6%).  
No other study eye AEs were reported by [CONTACT_726] 2 patients .  The majority of AEs were mild 
or moderate in sever ity.  There were 2 patients  with AEs of severe intensity: gastrointestinal 
inflammation and nasopharyngitis.  
Five patients  experienced serious adverse e vents (SAEs), namely device failure,  pelvic 
fracture, angina pectoris, chest pain and gastrointestinal i nflammation, but none were related 
to the study drug or injection procedure.   There were no discontinuations due to AEs.  
Vital signs and laboratory assessments did not show any particular clinically significant patterns or changes.  Study eye ophthalmic examinations did not indicate any unexpected 
clinical findings.  There were some transient findings post -injection (conjunctiva/sclera and 
cornea) that resolved prior to the next injection.  Vitreous haze was also reported for a few 
patients .  Intraocular pressure ( IOP) showed a small mean increase following injections but no 
indication of any cumulative increase.

A total of [ADDRESS_1128099].   The SAE 
resolved and was report ed to be related to the injection procedure.   None of the ocular AEs 
were assessed to be related to Zimura  or anti -VEGF treatment.  
The intravitreal administration of Zimura  in combination with an anti -VEGF agent (Avastin®, 
Eylea®, or Lucentis®) in patients with IPCV was generally well tolerated.   
 
4.3.4 Study OPH2003  
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_814904], multicenter, randomized, double-masked , Sham-controlled clinical trial 
was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zimura  in pati ents with geographic 
atrophy secondary to AMD .   
 
In Part 1 of the trial:  patients were randomized to receive monthly intravitreal injections of 
Zimura 1 mg; Zimura 
2 mg; and Sham injections.  
This trial was modified (while masked) to include  a 4 mg dose group and therefore part 2 was 
added.  In Part 2 of the trial: patients were randomized to receive monthly intravitreal injections of Zimura 4 mg, administered as two injections of Zimura 2 mg;  
 Zimura 2 mg plus a S ham injection; 
and  Sham injections, administered as two 
separate Sham injections.   
 
 

 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C  Page [ADDRESS_1128100] 12 months 
of the trial, the incidence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the untreated fellow eye was 10 patients (3.5%) ; in the study eye of the Sham control group was 3 patients (2.7%) ; 
in the Zimura 2 mg group was 6 patients (9.0%) ; and in the Zimura 4 mg group was 8 
patients (9.6%).   These numbers we re lower than reported in the literature for complement 
C3 inhibition (Liao et al., 2019).   The most frequently reported ocular adverse events were 
related to the injection procedure.  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The prespecified primary efficacy endpoint, mean rate of change in GA growth over 12 months, 
was measured by [CONTACT_645803] (FAF) based on readings at three time points 
(Baseline, Month 6, and Month 12) and was calculated using the square root transformation of 
the GA area.   The FAF images were assessed by [CONTACT_814925].   
This trial met its prespecified primary efficacy endpoint.  
The reduction in the mean rate of GA growth over 12 months was 27.38% (p = 0.0072) for the Zimura 2 mg group as compared to the corresponding S ham control group, and 27.81% (p = 
0.0051) for the Zimura 4 mg group as compared to the corresponding S ham control group.   
These efficacy data for both dose groups were similar and statistically significant.

Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page [ADDRESS_1128104] -mortem histopathologic studies  
performed by [CONTACT_814926] . 
The seminal genetic linkage studies pu blished in 2005 (Edwards et al., 2005; Hageman et al., 
2005; Haines et al., 2005; Klein et al., 2005; Narayanan et al., 2007)  infer that a pproximately 
50% of the dry and wet forms of AMD may have underlying activation of the complement 
system.  Further, the Y402H variant of the complement factor H (CFH) gene has been shown 
to be strongly associated with geographic atrophy in the populations of various countries ([LOCATION_002] of America, [LOCATION_008], Netherlands, Iceland) (Magnusson et al., 2006; 
Seddon et al ., 2007; Sepp et al., 2006) .  
In vitro  studies implicate the role of C5 in inf lammasome  priming and activation and MAC 
accumulation in RPE cells , leading to their degeneration (Brandstetter et al., 2015;  
Georgian nakis et al.,  2015;  Li et al., 2010).   The presence of NLRP3 inflamm asome and 
inflammasome products IL- 1ß and IL- [ADDRESS_1128105]-mortem eyes of patients with geographic atrophy (Tarallo et al., 2012 and Cao et al.,

2005) . 
The recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_814905] a significant reduction of GA growth 
in patients with AMD over 12 months  for both 2 mg and 4mg dose groups  (OPH2003).   Further, 
a third- party clinical trial evaluating the  role of complement inhibition in GA also showed a 
significant reduction in GA growth in patients with AMD over 12 months , validating the potential 
role of complement inhibition in the treatment of GA secondary to AMD (Liao et al., 2019) . 
Preclinical, clinical and genetic studies implicate the potential role of the complement cascade 
in AMD (Bok, 2005; Donoso et al., 2006; Edwards et al., 2005; Hageman et al., 2005; Haines 
et al., 2005, Liao et al., 2019, Brandstetter et al., 2015,  Georgiannakis et al.,  2015, Liao et al., 
2019, OPH2003 ).  Inhibition of complement activation may potentially slow down or arrest the 
underlying pathophys iology  of macular  degeneration.  Thus, molecules involved in regulati on 
and inhibition of complement cascade  are prime targets for therapeutic intervention in AMD.   
Zimura  is currently  being developed by [CONTACT_814927] D 
and Star gardt disease.  Zimura  is a pegylated RNA aptamer.  It is a potent and specific inhibitor 
of complement C5 .  Zimura  inhibits C5  cleavage , a central component of the complement

 cascade, which plays multiple roles in innate immunity and cell death.  Inhibition of this critical  
step in the complement cascade prevents the formation of key terminal fragments (C5a and 
C5b) regardless of the  initial activation pathway (alternate, classical , or lectin).  The C5a 
fragment plays an important role in inflammasome priming and activation leading to py roptosis  
and cell death.   C5b is involved in the formation of membrane attack complex (M AC: C5b -9) 
which  also leads to cell lysis and cell death.  By [CONTACT_645811] C5- mediated activities, one 
may slow down the progression of reti nal cell degeneration and achieve therapeutic benefit in 
GA secondary  AMD . 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_169579], the safety and efficacy of Zimura [ADDRESS_1128107] pi[INVESTIGATOR_169579] (OPH2003), in which both 
Zimura [ADDRESS_1128108] pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076], treatment with Zimura 2 mg dose, led to a 27.38% reduction in the mean rate of GA growth over 12 months as compared to the corresponding sham control group which was highly statistically significant (p -value = 0.0051).  In prior clinical studies, Zimura 2 mg 
dose was generally well -tolerated with no drug- related AEs, drug- related inflammation, or 
endophthalmitis. Therefore, the sponsor believes the risk/benefit assessment is favorable.   
Currently there are no treatments available for patients with geographic atrophy.

 Development of Wet AMD During the Trial 
If the investigator suspect s the development of CNV in the study eye, or if the subject has > [ADDRESS_1128124] and confirmed by [CONTACT_814932] -VEGF treatment in the study eye.  
For patients  who develop CNV  in the study eye  and the diagnosis is confirmed by [CONTACT_814933], the study eye should be treated with either Lucentis® 
(ranibizumab) or Eylea® (aflibercept) per their label.  
If the investigator plans to administer the anti -VEGF agent on the day of the diagnosis, the 
Duke Reading Center will confirm the diagnosis within 1 hour after receiving the images. If the anti-VEGF agent and Zimura/Sham  are administered in the SE on the same day , Zimura /Sham  
should be administered first , and the anti -VEGF administered second. The anti -VEGF  agent  
may NOT be administered after the Zimura/Sham injection until the IOP is ≤ 21 mmHg or within 5 mmHg of the baseline IOP  on that day ( i.e., the “baseline”  IOP is the pre -injection IOP before 
the Zimura/ Sham administration on that day) .  If the IOP is not  ≤ 21 mmHg or within 5 mmHg 
of the baseline IOP, the IOP should continue to be monitored until it is ≤ 21 mmHg or within 5 
mmHg of the baseline IOP before proceeding to the anti -VEGF injection.   
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page [ADDRESS_1128125]. Please refer to Appendix 17.5 Intravitreous Administration 
Protocol ; for example,  the use of aseptic technique, sterile gloves, anesthesia, eye speculum 
and povidone- iodine are required.    
The subject will continue with the study treatment (Zimura or Sham) as scheduled.  
For patients  who develop CNV in  the fellow eye  during the study, the fellow eye should be 
treated  with either Lucentis® (ranibizumab) or Eylea® (aflibercept) per their label , with no 
change to study conduct  regarding the study eye.  However, if the study eye is treated on 
the same day as the fellow ey e, the study eye should be treated before the fellow eye.  
 
 Withdrawal from Trial  
Patients  have the right to withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason.  The Investigator 
(after consultation with the Sponsor) or Sponsor also have the right to withdraw patients  from 
the trial in the event of concurrent illness, adverse events  (including pregnancy in female 
patients) , treatment -failure after a prescribed procedure, protocol violations, cure, 
administrative or other reasons.  
Final trial assessments as outlined in the Study Assessments Chart, Section 3, should be 
performed on all patients  who withdraw.  Patients  who withdraw due to an adverse event 
should be followed until resolution of the adverse event, or an adequate explanation for the 
event is obtained.  
Patients  who withdraw for any reason should have assessments performed according to t he 
Early Withdrawal schedule.  
 
 Trial Discontinuation  
The reason for a subject discontinuing from the trial will be recorded in the source documentation and case report form.  A discontinuation occurs when an enrolled subject ceases participation in the tr ial, regardless of the circumstances, prior to completion of the 
protocol.  The Investigator must determine the primary reason for discontinuation.  A 
discontinuation must be reported immediately to the clinical monitor or his/her designated representative if it is due to a serious adverse event (SAE) (see Section 12.3).  The final evaluation required by [CONTACT_814934].  The

Premature termination of this clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/EC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of IVERIC bio.   
The study will be considered completed when the last subject completes the final study visit.

 Study Design  
This is a randomized, double- masked,  Sham -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_814907]  2 mg  in reducing the mean  rate of GA growth over 12 months, 
when compared with Sham control.   
Approximately 400 patients  will be randomized at Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to the following monthly 
treatment groups:  
• Zimura  2 mg  
• Sham  
Patients receiving monthly Zimura  2 mg  will be re -randomized at Month 12  in a 1:1 ratio 
to the following treatment groups:  
• Zimura  2 mg  administered monthly from Month 12 -  Month 23      
• Sham administered at Months 12, 14, 16,18, 20, and 22, and Zimura 2 mg administered 
every other month at Months 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23  
All patients  who were initially randomized to Sham (at Day 1) will continue with monthly Sham 
injections through Month 23.  
All patients  will have a final follow up visit at Month 24.

 • All adverse events reported, whether or not deemed related to the injection procedure 
or study drug 
• All SAEs , whether or not deemed related to the injection procedure or study drug

• Ophthalmic variables ( best corrected visual acuity, low luminance best corrected 
visual acuity, IOP, and ophthalmic examination)  
• Vital sign measurements  
• 12-lead ECG  
 
 Determination of Sample Size and Statistical Rationale  
The sample size for this study is based on recently obtained 12- month results of the OPH2003 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_814904], multicenter, randomized, double masked, sham -controlled clinical trial 
that was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zimura in patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD .  The prespecified primary endpoint, mean change in GA growth 
over 12 months, equivalent to the mean rate  of GA growth used in thi s study, was measured 
by [CONTACT_645803] (FAF) based on readings at three time points (Baseline, Month 6, 
and Month 12) and was calculated using the square root transformation of the GA area.   The 
FAF images were assessed by [CONTACT_814936].  The reduction in the 
mean rate of GA growth over 12 months  was 0.11 mm (p = 0.0072) for the Zimura [ADDRESS_1128128] 
of Zimura on the mean rate of growth (slope)  estimated based on GA area measured by [CONTACT_814937] (FAF)  in at least 3 time points over 12 months , when compared with Sham 
(square root transformation) .  The FAF images w ill be  assessed by [CONTACT_814938].   The effect of treatment on the square root transformation of the GA area will 
be assessed using a mixed model for  repeated measures model  (MMRM) including 
stratification factors . 
A total of  approximately  [ADDRESS_1128129] 97% power to detect that effect at the two- sided significance level of 0.05. Statistical 
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page [ADDRESS_1128130]-12 month information will remain fully masked until completion of 24- month follow -up.  
 
 Randomization Procedure  
Patients  will be centrally allocated to one of the two  treatment groups  by a dynamic 
minimization procedure using clinical site in a 1:1 ratio stratified by [CONTACT_814939]:  
• Baseline visual acuity < 50 ETDRS letters (20/100 Snellen equivalent ) vs >  50 ETDRS 
letters  
• Size of B aseline geographic atrophy (< 4 disc areas vs >  4 disc areas)  
• Pattern of Fundus Auto Fluorescence (FAF) at the junctional zone of GA (None/focal vs 
banded/ diffuse)  
Patients  initially randomized to Zimura 2 mg at Day 1 will be re -randomized at Month 12 in 1:1 
ratio to Zimura 2 mg monthly vs every other month (please see 11.1 Study Design)  using the 
same minimization procedure as for the initial randomization (i.e. using the same factors at Baseline).   
Randomization will be performed using an IRT system based on the stratification information 
above to randomize each subject and assign a treatment arm.  
The IRT system will be used to assign masked study kits to patients  throughout the duration 
of the trial.  All study medication must be dispensed using the IRT system. At each dispensing 
visit the IRT system will allocate each study drug kit(s) using the kit number on the label of the 
study medication kit.   
 
 Masking Procedures  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_814908], the VA examiner, all masked study personnel , and the subject remain masked 
to the subject’s treatment assignment.  
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page [ADDRESS_1128131]’s  study documentation.   
In the case of a rare emergency where,  in the Investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649],  unmasking the treatment 
is necessary to evaluate a further course of action, the Investigator should access the IRT and 
follow the instructions to initiate unmasking.  Any unmasking should be reported to the 
unmasked contact [CONTACT_85681] S ponsor immediately.  
In the event of an unmasking,  the Investigator will be informed of the patient’s randomized 
treatment assignment.  Any unmasking information must be stored separately from the 
patient 's study files in a secure location to ensure the treatment assignment rem ains masked 
to other site, CRO and S ponsor personnel as required.  The IRT system will generate an email 
notification that does not contain unmasking information,  which will be sent to the Investigator 
and appropriate Sponsor personnel.  
 
11.6.[ADDRESS_1128132]/ophthalmologist, who will be masked to the subject’s 
treatment as well as previous visual acuity assessments.  The trial refractionist/ophthalmologist 
will be supplied only with the subject’s most r ecent protocol refraction.  
 
11.6.[ADDRESS_1128133] a minimum of two ophthalmologists –  the unmasked 
injector and the masked assessor.  The unmasked injector will perform the Zimura /Sham 
injection as well as the post -injection ophthalmic exam and tonometry measurements.  The 
unmasked injector and designated unmasked assistants (if needed) are not permitted to be 
involved in the conduct of the study in any other manner and are not to communicate with any other personnel or patients  regarding the treatment assignment.  The masked assessor will 
perform all other physician assessments including the relationship of all adverse events to 
study drug, including those noted by [CONTACT_559927].

 11.6.3  Statistical Analyses 
All statistical analyses will be performed by a statistical office independent of the study 
Sponsor.  The Sponsor and the patients  will remain masked to treatments until the end of the 
study, except if safety considerations justify breaking the code for individual patients . 
 
 Analytical Considerations  
11.7.1  Analytical Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide the details necessary for the statistical analyses 
to be explicitly pre- specified prior to unmasking, both at Month [ADDRESS_1128134]-baseline, missing data will be specified in the SAP.  
 
11.7.2  Significance Levels  
The overall  two-sided false positive error rate in this trial is 5% . 
 11.7.3  Descriptive Statistics  
Descriptive statistics will be provided on demographic information, treatment administration, 
Baseline characteristics , and protocol deviations, as well as for selected endpoints at relevant 
time points.  No tests of significance will be carried out to com pare treatment groups on 
Baseline data since the lack of a well -defined sampling context would render corresponding p -
values to be uninterpretable.    
 
11.7.4  Efficacy Analysis  
The efficacy analysis will be conducted on all randomized and treated patients  accordin g to 
the intention- to-treat principle.  
For normal endpoints, treatment groups will be compared through an analysis of variance 
including stratification factors.  
For binary endpoints, treatment groups will be compared through Mantel -Haenszel or 
Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel χ² tests adjusting for stratification factors . 
 
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page [ADDRESS_1128135] ics (i.e., mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) will be 
presented for all continuous variables.  
Summary statistics will be given on the number of patients for whom the trial medication had 
to be permanently stopped.  
 
12 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as follows:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject including 
unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship to 
this treatment.  
Adverse events include illnesses with onset during the trial, or exacerbations of pre- existing 
illnesses.  Exacerbation of pre- existing illness is defined as a significant increase in the severity 
of the illness as compared to the start of the trial and should be considered when a patient 
requires new or additional treatment for that illness.  Lack of or insuff icient clinical response or 
efficacy should not be recorded as an adverse event.  
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page 59                               2 4May2021 Confidential  
 In addition, clinically significant changes in objective findings (e.g., laboratory, ECG, X -ray, 
physical examination) should also be considered as to whether they are adverse  events.  The 
criteria for determining whether an objective finding should be reported as an adverse event 
are as follows:  
1. Associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or  
2. Requires medical/surgical intervention; and/or  
3. Leads to a change in trial dosing or dis continuation from the trial, significant additional 
concomitant drug treatment or other therapy; and/or  
4. Leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of a serious adverse event; and/or  
5. Is considered to be an advers e event by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator or S ponsor.  
Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse event.  
 
 Assessment and Reporting of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be recorded starting after the first dose of study  drug and 
continuing until [ADDRESS_1128136] fo llow up 
study visit is required to be followed up until the event resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the I nvestigator and/or Sponsor.  
All adverse events spontaneously reported, elicited,  or observed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigators will be 
recorded.  The events will be recorded in the source documents and onto the adverse event 
pages of the case report form, including date of onset and resolution, severity, relationship to 
trial treatment and determination of whether the event qualifies as a “ serious ” adverse event 
(Section 12.3) . 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not 
be reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, an 
acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse event, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treat ment of the 
adverse event.  
The Investigator will take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the adverse 
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page [ADDRESS_1128137]’s source documents and on the appropr iate pages of the subject’s case report form.  
To assist with grading of adverse event severity, the following definitions are provided:  
Mild = Aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated;  
Moderate  = Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual 
activity;  
Severe = Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity;  
Adverse events are assessed as “not related” or “related”  to  one of the following : (1) the 
intravitreous injection procedure ( including eyelid speculum, anesthetic drops, mydriatic drops, 
antibiotic drops, povidone -iodine, subconjunctival injection of anesthetic, intravitreous injection 
of Zimura or anti -VEGF ), or (2) related to the study drug (Zimura/sham), or (3) related to anti -
VEGF treatment (if admini stered).   
The adverse  relationship will be assessed using the definitions below. The investigator will 
choose either “not related”, or chose the most likely cause of the AE (i.e., only one of the 
relationships noted in the above paragraph may be chosen):  
 
Not Related  = There is not a reasonable possibility that the adverse 
event is related to the intravitreous injection procedure,  or 
to the study drug (Zimura/sham), or to the anti -VEGF 
treatment . 
Related  =  There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event is 
related to the intravitreous  injection procedure or to the 
study  drug (Zimura/sham), or to the anti -VEGF treatment.  
 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is any event that:  
1. Results in death;  
2. Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);  
3. Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
4. Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or  
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page 61                               2 4May2021 Confidential  
 5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312753], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient/subject and may require medical or surgical interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A life -threatening adverse event is any event that places the patient/subject at immediate risk 
of death from the reaction as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it oc curred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Disability is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645799].  For chronic or long- term inpatients, 
inpatient adm ission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care 
inpatient unit (e.g., from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, from a medical floor to the 
coronary care unit).   
• Inpatient admission does not include the following:  
o Emergenc y Room/Casualty Department visits  
o Outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures and observation/short -stay units  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_814909] (e.g., caregiver relief)  
o Rehabilitation facilities, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, custodial care facilities  
• Inpatient admission in the absence of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], treatment -emergent, clinical 
adverse event may meet criteria for “seriousness” but is not an adverse event and thus is not subject to immediate reporting to the Sponsor.  For example:  
o Admission for treatment of a pre- existing condition not associated with the 
development of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the pre -existing 
condition (e.g., for work -up of persistent pretreatment lab abnormality)  
o Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep)  
o Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (e.g., yearly physical, elective cosmetic surgery)  
 
Protocol GATHER2  (ISEE2008)  – Global Amendment: C   Page [ADDRESS_1128138] be made regardless of the extent of available 
adverse event information.  This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -
up) on previously forwarded serious adverse event reports.  
All Serious Adverse Events must be reported  by [CONTACT_645822] 24 hours.  
Refer to the “Safety Contact [CONTACT_46979]” provided separately  
 
 Independent Dat a Monitoring Committee  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee, consisting of persons who are independent of the Sponsor, trial coordination center, data coordination center, regulatory agencies, IRB/EC and investigators, and who have no financial, scientific, or other conflict of interest with the clinical trial, will meet approximately every  [ADDRESS_1128139] of the study, collection of accurate and timely data, 
and promptly report potential safety concerns to the Data Monitoring committee, and 
communicate with regulatory authorities, IRB/EC, and investigators in a manner that maintains 
integrity of the data as necessary.

1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title:  Word Retrieval in the Wild: An Ecological Momentary 
Assessment Pi[INVESTIGATOR_442928] -Stroke Aphasia  
Grant Number:  UL1 TR002544  
Study Description:  People with post -stroke aphasia (PWA) suffer from anomia, a condition 
where they know what they want to  
say but cannot retrieve the words. For PWA, word retrieval changes 
moment -to-moment, leading to diminished  
motivation to participate in conversations and disengagement from 
social interactions. In the real world, anomia  
variability and severity are compounded by [CONTACT_442964] (noise, dual -tasking).  
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves in -situ measurement 
of a behavior over time during everyday  
life. EMA has promise for capturing real -world anomia, yet EMA 
methods have not been tested in PWA.  
To target in -situ anomia, PWA will complete 36 pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] -naming 
trials/day for three weeks,  
delivered either as a single trial 36 times per day (1 -item EMA 
condition) or in four sets of nine trials/set per day (9 -item EMA 
condition). Prior to completing community/home -based EMAs, 
participants will undergo standardized testing and smart device 
training. During the EMA period, participants will complete a brief 
survey about their EMA experiences at the end of each week. Following 
completion of the EMA protocol, participants will complete one final 
assessment and exit interview session.  
Objectives*:  Primary Objective:  To evaluate the feasibility of ecological 
momentary assessment (EMA) of naming 
abilities in people with post -stroke aphasia  
Secondary 
Objectives:  Determine relationships between feasibility 
metrics and personal factors  
 
Endpoints*:  Primary Endpoint:  Compliance and completion over a 3 -week 
EMA protocol  
Secondary 
Endpoints:  Perceived burden of completing EMAs 
during the 3 -week protocol  
 
Study Population:  Individuals with post -stroke aphasia  
Phase* or Stage:  Chronic stroke (at least 6 months after stroke onset)

9-item EMA condition, counterbalanced for aphasia sev erity. Next, 
PWA will complete the three -week community/home -based EMA 
protocol. Each day, PWA will be scheduled to attempt naming aloud 36 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_442931], either delivered either as a 
single trial 36 times per day (1 -item EMA condi tion) or in four sets of 
nine trials/set per day (9 -item EMA condition).   During the EMA period, 
participants will complete a brief survey about their EMA experiences 
at the end of each week. Following completion of the EMA protocol, 
participants will comp lete one final assessment and exit interview 
session.

Protocol  15 March 2022  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research Involving Humans – v4.0 2018 -12-12 7 Pre-EMA Testing  Testing: (1) Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB)  to measure overall 
aphasia severity, (2) the Pattern Comparison  Processing 
Speed Test and Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test 
from the NIH Cognition Toolbox  to measure non -linguistic 
visual attention and executive functions, respectively, (3) 
brief, standardized pi[INVESTIGATOR_442932], and (4) an overt object 
naming test to index  word retrieval via a standa rd SLP 
assessment format (i.e., single administration in a quiet 1:1 
interaction). The  naming test will include normed real 
photos 17 of the 260 items from the Snodgrass and 
Vanderwart  stimuli set.  PWA will also participate in an intake 
interview and complete a questionnaire about their comfort 
with technology,  adapted for aphasia (simple language, short 
phrases).  
  
Smart device training including: (1)  Smartwatch Orientation: 
PWA will be oriented to the smartwatch (interface, charging, 
etc.) through simple verbal and written instructions and 
visual demonstrations. (2) EMA Task Training: PWA will be 
instructed on the s pecific EMA naming task, including 
instructions on how to tap on the screen and the optimal 
approach for providing verbal responses (i.e., mouth close to 
the watch). Then, PWA will complete an 18 -item traditional 
EMA -style naming task probe (i.e., several trials back -to-back 
on the smartwatch) in a quiet room in The Aphasia Network 
(TAN) Lab at Northeastern University. During this probe, SLP 
graduate student research assistants (RAs) will provide 
cueing and feedback so that PWA successfully learn how to 
operate the smartwatch and respond to prompts. (3) EMA 
Protocol Simulation: PWA will complete a “real -world” EMA 
task probe in a distracting environment (i.e., coffee shop or 
university bookstore on Northeastern’s campus). For this 
final activity, over a 45 -minute period, 18 smartwatch 
prompts will be given, either randomly interspersed with one 
naming trial per prompt (for PWA in the 1 -item condition) or 
split into two sets of 9 trials per prompt (for PWA in the 9 -
item EMA condition). This final activity will  mirror the three -
week EMA protocol.  
EMA Protocol  For three weeks, PWA will name [CONTACT_442982][INVESTIGATOR_442933]. At the end of each week, PWA will complete 
a virtual check -in with the study team at which time they 
will also complete a brief (16 -item) Qualtrics survey 
about their EMA experiences that week.

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research Involving Humans – v4.0 2018 -12-12 9 2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) holds promise for providing objective insight into the everyday 
experiences of patients with a variety of clinical conditions. To date, there is little EMA research that 
includes stroke survivors with aphasia. Thus, th e primary rationale for this study is to evaluate and 
demonstrate the feasibility of a novel smartwatch -delivered, audio -based EMA of naming protocol in 
individuals with chronic aphasia. This project is an important first step towards testing the clinical utility 
of EMA for better understanding everyday communication difficulties and other challenges that PWA 
face in daily life.  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_563280] retrieval —also known as anomia —is one of the most debilitating symptoms stroke 
survivors with aphasia, a communication disorder characterized by [CONTACT_442965], face in their daily 
lives. Like “tip -of- the-tongue” states experienced by [CONTACT_442966][INVESTIGATOR_442934], anomic moments in 
people with aphasia (PWA) occur when an individual knows what they want to say but cannot retrieve 
the word. Unlike “tip -of-the-tongue,” anomia in PWA pervades communication exchanges and is 
characterized by [CONTACT_442967] a given word across attempts. The severity and 
unpredictability of anomia lead many PWA to disengage from conversation and social situations, which 
can severely impact their participation and quality of life. In daily life, anomia  can be further 
compounded by [CONTACT_5203] -world communication contexts such as attempting to communicate in distracting 
settings (e.g., with background noise and/or other people in the vicinity) or when completing other 
tasks. In clinical practice, speech -languag e pathologists (SLPs) typi[INVESTIGATOR_442935] a 
standardized test once to a patient in a quiet room. This approach captures neither the variability typi[INVESTIGATOR_442936] -stroke anomia nor the realities of real -world communication. In contrast, e cological momentary 
assessment (EMA) is a method often used in health research to measure physical, mental, or cognitive 
states in a person’s daily life over several days, weeks or even months. Traditional EMA involves a device 
prompting a participant to a nswer a set of questions a few times a day, whereas micro -interaction -
based EMA (μEMA) uses single -question, “at -a-glance” prompts that are interspersed over time rather 
than grouped into sets. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_442937] μEMA has higher response ra tes and lower 
perceived burden than traditional EMA in neurotypi[INVESTIGATOR_442938]. 
Thus, we propose that EMA —particularly μEMA —is a viable approach to capture real -world anomia in 
PWAs’ daily lives. Yet, despi[INVESTIGATOR_442939] -based assessments and therapy 
platforms for PWA, neither EMA nor μEMA methods have been utilized in aphasia.

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research Involving Humans – v4.[ADDRESS_563284]’s end and/or until recruitment goals 
are achieved:  
  
Northeastern University Speech, Language, and Hearing Center (SLHC) : The Northeastern University 
SLHC provides clinical SLP and audiology services to individuals across the lifespan with communication 
disorders. Led by [CONTACT_442971], the Aphasia Workshop is a new program offered through 
the SLHC in which PWA complete a one -time assessment of speech and language skills. Each academic 
semester, up to five PWA participate in this program. [CONTACT_442985] has agreed to share study flyers with 
new part icipants each semester and to email previous Aphasia Workshop attendees. [CONTACT_442985] is also 
the coordinator of adult SLP practicum placements for graduate students in the Communication 
Sciences and Disorders Department at Northeastern and has contacts wi th several SLPs working in the 
greater [LOCATION_011] area. [CONTACT_442985] has agreed to email area SLPs with information about TAN Lab and the 
proposed study.  
  
[LOCATION_011] University (BU) Aphasia Research Laboratory : Directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Swathi Kiran, the BU Aphasia 
Research Lab maintains a database of nearly [ADDRESS_563285] information for TAN Lab.  
  
Other Recruitment Methods : We will recruit stroke survivors via flyers placed at local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], senior 
centers, and clinics that serve individuals with neurogenic disorders. We will also develop and 
implement a pi[INVESTIGATOR_442940] r that will be initiated 
following a meeting with the Tufts Recruitment and Retention Team. Finally, we will present at the 
[LOCATION_011] University Aphasia Community Group in April 2022 (established via personal communication 
between [CONTACT_442986] and [CONTACT_442987], the clinical director of the BU Aphasia Resource Center). 
The Aphasia Community Group is held one Saturday per month and regularly welcomes up to 100 PWA 
and their family/friends.  
  
When possible, TAN Lab study team members will take advantage of “the clinical moment” that occurs 
with face -to-face interactions with patients at community engagement events and via one -on-one 
clinical research encounters. The goal of these interactions w ill not solely be to inform potential 
participants of the present study but to engage PWA in the research process, convey the larger goals of 
TAN Lab, and describe our work towards maximizing outcomes for PWA. [CONTACT_125977] and TAN Lab SLP 
graduate student RAs  will utilize their clinical aphasia expertise and collaborate with the Tufts CTSI 
Recruitment and Retention Team to develop effective externally facing materials for engaging potential 
participants. Written recruitment materials and in -person communicatio ns will incorporate aphasia -
friendly language (simple language, short phrases) and multimodal auditory -visual strategies to aid 
comprehension for PWA with severe language deficits. Working with the Tufts CTSI Recruitment and

color. One strategy will be to maximize engagement with Hispanic/Latinx and Asian PWA involved in an 
active clinical trial conducted by [CONTACT_442972]. Given our 
multipronged approach, the large pool of potential participants, and expected high interest in the study, 
we anticipate having a waitlist of potential participants. Thus, a second approach will be to prio ritize 
participation of PWA of color on the waitlist to ensure their necessary inclusion in this study. All efforts 
will be made to maximize retention of enrolled participants. We will do so by: (1) careful screening of 
potential participants in which we e xplain in detail the procedures (e.g., protocols, time commitment) 
and provide time and opportunity for addressing the questions/concerns of participants and/or care 
providers, (2) providing flexible scheduling options and assistance with arranging transpo rtation as 
needed, and (3) weekly contacts in weeks 2 -4 during the EMA/μEMA protocols with PWA and/or their 
care providers.

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S) ADMINISTRATION  
6.1.1 STUDY INTERVENTION OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION DESCRIPTION  
  
Participants will be pseudo -randomly assigned to either the 1 -item EMA condition (n = 10) or 9 -item 
EMA condition (n = 10). For every prompt, the smartwatch will vibrate to alert the participant to a 
prompt to complete either a single pi[INVESTIGATOR_442941] (in the 1 -item condition) or a set of pi[INVESTIGATOR_442942] (in the 9 -item EMA condition). Participants in both conditions will be scheduled to 
complete 36 overt pi[INVESTIGATOR_442943]. The only difference between 
conditions will be the trial delivery schedule: PWA in the [ADDRESS_563286] for which PWA.  
6.1.2 ADMINISTRATION AND/OR DOSING  
In each condition, the smartwatch will vibrate to alert PWA to a single naming trial (1 -item condition) or 
naming trial set (9 -item EMA condition). After the vibration alert, PWA will see a screen that says “Ready 
to name a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]?” (1 -item condition) or “Ready to name [CONTACT_442983][INVESTIGATOR_499]?” (9 -item EMA condition). If 
the participant taps YES, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_442944], and the device will begin recording audio. PWA will have 
up to five seconds to provide an oral response, after which a “Thanks!” screen will appear. The five -
second response window was selected based on research showing that PWA correctly name [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_442945] 3.[ADDRESS_563287] responses. If a participant 
fails to respond to a vibration prompt or pushe s the NO button to the “Ready?” screen, they will be re -
prompted five minutes later via one more vibration alert. During the three -week EMA protocol, each 
participant will attempt to name 108 unique objects derived from the 260 -item Snodgrass and 
Vanderwar t photoset. The subset of pi[INVESTIGATOR_442946] (during week 1, session 1). When possible, half of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_442947], and the other half will b e incorrectly named pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. This 
approach will allow us to gauge naming variability over time of items PWA are able versus unable to 
name [CONTACT_442984], providing an important window into anomia. To mitigate 
practice effects, the indi vidual pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] (1 -item condition) or pi[INVESTIGATOR_442948] (9 -item EMA condition) will be 
presented randomly without replacement until all [ADDRESS_563288] been presented, and then the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_442949]. In both conditions, 36 naming trials will be sched uled per day, resulting in a 
total of 756 scheduled trials for each participant across the experiment. In the 1 -item EMA condition, 
single -naming trial prompts will appear at random intervals from 10am to 8pm. In the 9 -item EMA 
condition, PWA will receive four prompts per day to complete a set of nine pi[INVESTIGATOR_442950]; one prompt will be scheduled in every 2.[ADDRESS_563289] Retrieval in the Wild: An Ecological Momentary Assessment Pi[INVESTIGATOR_442928] -

6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
  
6.5.1 RESCUE THERAPY  
Participants are allowed to continue any therapy (including speech -language therapy) that they are 
receiving at the time of the study. Because this trial involves no intervention, concomitant therapy will 
not impact the trial results. The study team will not dispense rescue therapy.

PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
If the study term observes several time periods of missed trials, they will address the issue with a 
participant during the weekly check -in. As feasibility is the cornerstone of this trial, the study team will 
not discontinue participants for reasons relat ed to protocol adherence.  
 
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. If a 
participant withdraws, the study team will obtain the reason(s) for withdraw. An investigator may 
discontinue a participant from the study for the following re asons: (1) Lost -to-follow up; unable to 
contact [CONTACT_1130] (see Section 7.3, Lost to Follow -Up), and (2) any event or medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued collection of study data would not be in the best interest of the participant 
or mi ght require an additional EMA period that would confound the interpretation of the study.

actions will be taken if a participant fails to return to the lab for a required study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299], reschedule the missed visit or check -in, counsel the 
participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule, and ascertain if the participant 
wishes to and/or should continue in the study  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to 
regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and/or emails). These contact

8.1 ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON -SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Endpoint Assessments : Feasibility will be classified in three ways: (1) PWAs’ adherence to the 
smartwatch μEMA or EMA protocol via compliance and completion, (2) PWAs’ perceived burden of 
completing the EMA protocol, and (3) speech intelligibility of recorded naming attempts.  Currently, 
PWAs’ capacity for adhering to a smartwatch EMA protocol via button press responses or verbal 
responses is unknown. As such, compliance will be based on the number of YES button responses to the 
“Ready?” screen whereas completion will be based on naming attempts. Specifically, similar to Intille et 
al. (2016), compliance will be determined by [CONTACT_442973], 
including trials missed due to the watch being off/uncharged. Completion will be calculated as trials wi th 
captured audio (reflecting attempted naming) over delivered trials, excluding trials missed to the watch 
being off/uncharged. Perceived burden will be measured via responses to the weekly surveys during 
weeks 2 -4. Finally, speech intelligibility will be  measured by a categorical rating of responses captured in 
each audio clip (i.e., completely intelligible, partially intelligible, or completely unintelligible).  
  
Other Non -Safety Assessments : Before the EMA period,  PWA will be administered the following testing 
battery. The Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB)  will be used as our eligibility assessment and  to measure 
overall aphasia severity. The Pattern Comparison  Processing Speed Test and Flanker Inhibitory Control 
and Attention Test from the NIH Cognition Toolbox  will be used  to measure non -linguistic visual 
attention and executive functions, respectively. We will use brief, standardized pi[INVESTIGATOR_442951]. Participants will 
complete an overt object naming test twice before EMA and once after EMA so that the research team 
can evaluate word retrieval via the standard SLP assessment forma t (i.e., single administration in a quiet 
1:1 interaction). This pi[INVESTIGATOR_442952] 260 items from the 
Snodgrass and Vanderwart  stimuli set. Before EMA, PWA will also participate in an intake interview and 
complete a questionnaire about their comfort with technology,  adapted for aphasia (simple language, 
short phrases).

8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
Please see below.  
[IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT  
  
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severity.  
(1) Mild: Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participants' daily 
activities.  
(2) Moderate: Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the EMA measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with fu nctioning.  
(3) Severe: Events interrupt a participant's usual daily activity and may require treatment. Severe events 
are potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  
[IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
  
All adverse events (AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including EMAs, assessed by [CONTACT_252061] -trained lab member based on temporal relationship and their judgment. The degree of 
certainty about causality will be graded using the c ategories below.  
- Related: The AE is known to occur with the study procedures, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study procedures caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study procedures and 
the event. Reasonable possibility means that ther e is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the study procedures and the AE.  
-Not Related: There is not a reasonable possibility that the study procedures caused the event, there is 
no temporal relationship between the study procedures and event  onset, or an alternate etiology has 
been established.  
[IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS  
  
A trained lab member with appropriate expertise in will be responsible for determining whether an 
adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature,

the study procedures.  
8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
  
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant.  All AEs, not otherwise 
precluded per the protocol, will be captured on the approp riate case report form (CRF). Information to 
be collected includes event description, time of onset, study team member's assessment of severity, 
relationship to study procedures (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a 
diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
  
Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant's condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. Changes in the severity of an AE 
will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be 
performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_442953].

8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
  
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_31279] (OHRP). OHRP considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or 
others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following 
criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the  characteristics of the participant 
population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research ("possibly related" means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_226592]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
8.4.2 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS REPORTING  
  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and to the principal investigators (PIs). The UP report will include the following information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI's name, and the IRB project number  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome

an UP  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are 
proposed in response to the UP.  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:  UPs 
that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor/funding 
agency within [insert timeline in accordance wit h policy] of the investigator becoming aware of the 
event. Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the study sponsor within 10 days of the 
investigator becoming aware of the problem.  All UPs will be reported to appropriate institutional 
officials ( as required by [CONTACT_17347]'s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or 
designee), and the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within 30 days of the IRB's receipt of 
the report of the problem from the investigator.

9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): Compliance and completion will be significantly higher for participants who 
complete the 1 -item EMA condition versus participants who complete the 9 -item EMA condition.   
• Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s): Speech intelligibility will be over 80% across trials. Perceived burden will 
not significantly differ between participants who complete the 1 -item versus 9 -item EMA conditions.  
  
 
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
For the Aim #1 logistic mixed effects models, two groups of 10 PWA per group will achieve 80% power 
to detect an odds ratio of 1.20 in a design of 756 repeated measures with a AR(1) covariance structure 
and when the correlation between observations of the same subject is 0.600 and alpha is 0.05. If the 
proportion of completed trials for the EMA group is 0.500, a statistically significant result will occur if the 
μEMA group proportion is 0.545 or greater. In Intille et al.4, the mean difference in proportion s between 
the μEMA and EMA conditions was >0.[ADDRESS_563298] -stroke aphasia

attempt captured on audio (n trials will vary by [CONTACT_9702]) will be coded as 0 for incomplete or 1 for 
complete, reflecting completion. For each of these measu res, we will run a logistic mixed effects model 
with one of the feasibility measures (i.e., compliance, completion) as the dependent variable, condition 
(1-item vs. 9 -item) as the independent variable, and random effects of participant and trial.   
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Every audio clip (n trials will vary by [CONTACT_9702], depending on the number of naming attempts) will be 
coded as 0 for completely or partially unintelligible and 1 for completely intelligible, reflecting speech 
intelligibility. We will run a logistic mixed eff ects model with intelligibility as the dependent variable, 
condition (1 -item vs. 9 -item) as the independent variable, and random effects of participant and 
trial.  For perceived burden, we will collect responses on three questions/survey for three weeks. Gi ven 
the small amount of data, survey responses will be plotted to visualize trends in increasing/decreasing 
burden rather than compared statistically. We will statistically compared averaged burden ratings 
between participants in the 1 -item vs. 9 -item cond ition using t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests 
(depending on the distribution of the data).

10.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
  
Please see below  
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS  
  
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting 
intervention/administering study intervention.  
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
Interested potential participants or family members/caregivers of PWA who contact [CONTACT_442978] (TAN) Lab will be contact[CONTACT_205903] [INVESTIGATOR_442955] a trained research assistant via phone or email, and 
an initial meeting will be scheduled in person at TAN Lab or in the comfort of the participant’s home. 
During the initial meeting, study personnel will provide details about the study, answer questions, and 
complete a brief demographic and medical history intake. If the potential participant is interested in 
enro lling in the study, lab personnel (PI [INVESTIGATOR_442955] a trained TAN Lab research assistant) will explain study 
procedures and answer participant and caregiver questions. During the informed consent process, 
potential participants will be shown the EMA equipment ( either through photographs or the physical 
apparatus). Additional measures will be taken to obtain informed consent from individuals with 
impairment language comprehension due to stroke. Individuals with post -stroke aphasia may have 
difficulty understandin g spoken and/or written language due to their aphasia. To ensure these 
participants understand study protocols, lab personnel (PI [INVESTIGATOR_442955] a TAN Lab research assistant trained 
to communicate with people with aphasia) will supplement the standard consent fo rm text with simpler 
spoken and/or written language and provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_442956] (of e.g., the smart watch) as needed. 
Supplemental spoken and/or written language will include key words/phrases from the provided 
materials but reframed or highlighted to m aximize the understanding of study procedures by 
[CONTACT_442979]. At the end of this process for both the longitudinal study and focus group, 
potential participants with aphasia will be asked a series of simple questions regarding basic 
study/gro up procedures to check their comprehension. If a participant fails the comprehension check 
(i.e., answers any question incorrectly), information pertaining to the incorrectly answered item(s) will 
be reviewed and another comprehension check will be done. F or individuals with aphasia who are not 
capable of providing consent, informed written consent will be obtained from a legally authorized 
representative (e.g., family member, caregiver). Verbal or nonverbal assent will be obtained and 
reaffirmed throughout  the study procedures. If participants exhibit discomfort, fatigue, or verbal or 
nonverbal signs of distress, breaks will be provided, and study procedures will be terminated early if

protocols and decide whether they wish to participate in the study. Then, informed written consent will 
be obtained.  
10.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by [CONTACT_442980]. If the study is 
prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study 
participants, the IRB, and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. 
Study partic ipants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Insufficient compliance of study staff to the protocol (i.e., significant protocol violations)  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that the primary endpoint has been met  
The study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are 
addressed, and satisfy the funding agency, sponsor, and IRB.

10.1.8 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
  
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented as follows:  
• Informed consent - Study staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process as well as a 
percentage of the completed consent documents. This review will evaluate compliance with GCP, 
accuracy, and completeness. Feedback will be provided to the study team to ensure proper consenting 
procedures are followed.  
• Source documents and the electronic data - Data will be initially captured on source documents (see 
Section 10.1.9, Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and will ultimately be entered into the study database. 
To ensure accuracy site staff will compare a repre sentative sample of source data against the database, 
targeting key data points in that review.  
• Protocol Deviations - The study team will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will 
implement corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a level of 
concern.  
Should independent monitoring become necessary, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_31236], source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_103]/funding agency, and inspection by [CONTACT_3482].

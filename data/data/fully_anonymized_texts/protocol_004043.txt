TERA  Primary Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Version 3 June 24, 2020 
Page 3 of 10 1 Introduction  
1.1 Purpose 
This Primary Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) describes analyses of  the primary and secondary 
objectives of the TERA study . The Primary SAP outlines the general statistical approaches that 
will be used in the analysis of the study.  It has been developed to f acilitate discussion of the 
statistical analysis components among the study team, and to provide agreement between the 
study team and statisticians regarding the statistical analyses presented in the primary statistical 
analysis report.  This analysis plan may be modified by [CONTACT_479798].  In addition, 
some analyses may be om itted if there is insufficient information.  Outlines of analyses for the 
other objectives will be presented in separate SAPs .   Detailed outlines of tables, figures, and 
coding descriptions are included in a separate Analysis Implementation Plan (AIP).  
The primary statistical report will be used for submission of results to ClinicalTrial s.gov.  Results 
for primary measures must  be submitted within one year of the primary completion date (PCD), 
which for TERA is based on 12 weeks of follow -up.  Results for secondary outcomes measures 
are due one year after follow -up is complete on all study participants.

2 Protocol Overview  
2.1 Study Design  
TERA is a Phase II, randomized, open-label study designed to assess the effectiveness of a 
Triggered Escalating Real -Time Adherence (TERA) intervention for 12 weeks in Youth Living 
With HIV (YLWH) failing antir etroviral therapy (ART).  This time -limited approach includes 
education and motivational skills building from an adherence coach and monitoring with wireless 
electronic dose monitoring (EDM), for identification of delayed and missed doses of antiretroviral s 
and related alerts and coach phone-based outreach.  
The original design was to enroll 120 YLWH,  stratif y by [CONTACT_654] (<18 years vs. ≥18 years) , and 
randomize with equal probability to TERA or continuing standard-of -care (SOC) for adherence.  
At entry, half were randomly selected to engage in additional in-depth interviews about their 
experiences at Weeks [ADDRESS_616189] 2019, the Adolescent Tr ials Network Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) 
recommended that accrual be closed and the 89 enrolled participants continue follow -up to study 
completion.  
In March 2020, study visits were paused due to the outbreak of  COVID -19.  The study team 
decided to use the ‘pre-COVID’ database to analyze the primary and secondary objectives , since 
data collected after study visits resumed would be inherently different . This required a change to 
the definition of the virologic secondary outcome measures.   It also meant that sample sizes at 
later study visits would be lower than anticipated, with a corresponding reduction in power to 
detect differences between arms.   Additional data may be collected at study visits that take place 
after sites re-open.  Analysis of these data will be outlined in a separate SAP.  
 
2.2 Hypotheses 
1. Youth in the TERA arm will be more likely to achieve viral suppression at Weeks 12  
(primary) , 24, [ADDRESS_616190] higher rates of weekly dosing as measured by [CONTACT_479799] 48 weeks than those in the SOC arm  
4. Viral suppression and adherence will be associated with gains in adherence-related information, motivation and behavioral skills, which will be higher in youth in the TERA 
arm than those in the SOC arm  
5. Youth will report positive attitudes and experiences with the intervention on interview with 
themes emerging relative to adherence support that are unique from those in the SOC arm. 
2.3 Objectives   
Primary Objective:  
TERA  Primary Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Version 3 June 24, 2020 
Page 5 of 10 1. To estimate and compare HIV virologic suppression rates in YLWH 12 weeks after 
initiating TERA or continuing SOC.  
Secondary objectives :  
1. To estimate and compare virologic suppression r ates in YLWH 24, 36, and 48 weeks 
after initiating TERA or continuing SOC  
2. To estimate and compare proportions of participants initiating TERA or continuing SOC 
who achieve virologic suppression (HIV -1 RNA < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) by 12 weeks and 
maintain virologic  suppression through 48 weeks  
3. To summarize and compare adherence patterns in YLWH initiating TERA or continuing 
SOC during on-intervention period (week 0-12) and post intervention period (week > 12-
48). 
3 Definitions  
“Study entry” is defined as the randomizat ion date.  The value used for baseline summaries will 
be the last evaluation on or before the randomization date.   
Any youth found to be ineligible or who the Core Team determine should not be included in any 
analyses, will be included in screening, accrual and eligibility summaries only. Otherwise, 
analyses will be intent -to-treat (ITT), including all eligible participants randomized to the study  and 
by [CONTACT_141585], regardless of compliance to the TERA intervention, SOC, or ART regimen.   
4 Statistical M ethods  
4.1 General considerations  
Baseline characteristics will be summarized by [INVESTIGATOR_216], but with no statistical comparisons.  In general, categorical data will be summarized using N (%) and continuous data using N, key 
quantiles , and mean (STD) when appropriate.    
Because of the interruption in study visits due to the COVID -19 pandemic  in March 2020, 
analyses of the primary and secondary objectives will use the ‘pre-COVID’ study database 
including all data collected before study visits were paused .  By [CONTACT_11711] [ADDRESS_616191] atistical tests 
(all two-sided)  will not be adjusted for interim monitoring, multiple comparisons or stratification for 
age.  Significance levels p<0.[ADDRESS_616192] ace at screening, entry (which may be the same day as screening), and Weeks 
4, 12, 24, 36, and 48.  All measures on or before the randomization date are grouped as Week 0, 
TERA  Primary Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Version [ADDRESS_616193] to and on or before the randomization date used as the baseli ne 
measurement.  Scheduled visit windows for the week 4 and 12 visit is ± 14 days  and for weeks 
24, 36 and 48 the window is ± [ADDRESS_616194] to the scheduled study week will be 
used.   
4.3 Outcome measure definitions  
Primary o bjective: To estimate and compare HIV virologic suppression rates in YLWH 12 weeks 
after initiating TERA or continuing SOC.    
This analysis will exclude participants dying before Week 12 for reasons unrelated to HIV.   
Outcome measures:  
i. HIV-1 RNA <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml. Participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml or with no HIV -1 
RNA measurement within the Week 12 window (± 14 days) will be classified as failures  
ii. HIV-1 RNA < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml. Participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥ 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml or with no HIV -
1 RNA measurement within the Week 12 window (± 14 days) will be classified as failures  
Secondary objectives : 
1. To estimate and compare virologic suppression rates in YLWH 24, 36, and 48 weeks after 
initiating TERA or continuing SOC.   
These analyses will exclude participants dying before W eek 24 ( 36, 48) for reasons unrelated 
to HIV.   Outcome measures:  
i. HIV-1 RNA < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml. This analysis will only include participants with the 
opportunity to reach the targeted study visit  prior to the COVID study pause.  Participants 
with HIV -1 RNA ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml,  or who had the opportunity to reach the study visit week 
and with no HIV -1 RNA measurement within ± 28 days of the scheduled visit , will be 
classified as failures  
ii. HIV-1 RNA < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml. This analysis will only include participants w ith the 
opportunity to reach the targeted study visit  prior to the COVID study pause.  Participants 
with HIV -1 RNA ≥ 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml,  or who had the opportunity to reach the study visit week 
and with no HIV -1 RNA measurement within ± 28 days of the scheduled visit, will be 
classified as failures  
2. To estimate and compare proportions of participants initiating TERA or continuing SOC who 
achieve virologic suppression (HIV -1 RNA < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) by 12 weeks and maintain 
virologic suppression through 48 weeks .   
This analysis will exclude participants dying before Week 48 for reasons unrelated to HIV.   
Outcome measure:  
i. HIV-1 RNA < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48. This analysis will only include 
participants with the opportunity to reach Week 48 prior to the COVID study pause.  
Participants will be classified as virologic successes if the Week 12 (± 14 days) and 48 (± 
28 days) HIV -1 RNA measurements are < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and at least one of the Week 
TERA  Primary Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Version 3 June 24, 2020 
Page 7 of 10 24 (± 28 days) and Week 36 (± 28 days) HIV -1 RNA measurements  is < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.  
Participants will be classified as failures if (1) either of the Week 12 or 48 HIV -1 RNA 
measurements are ≥ 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, (2) HIV -1 RNA  at both Week 24 (± 28 days) and 
Week 36 (± 28 days) are ≥ 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL , (3) both the HIV-1 RNA measurement s 
between Weeks 12 and 48 are missing, or (4) either or both the Week 12 and Week 48 
HIV-1 RNA are missing.  
3. To summarize and compare adherence patterns in YLWH initiating TERA or continuing SOC 
during on-intervention period (week 0-12) and post intervention period (week > 12-48).    
Outcome measures:  
i. Electronic dose monitored adherence: Percent of days with dose taken per week  
ii. Electronic dose monitored on-time adherence: Percent of days with dose taken within the 
defined acceptable windows (±  4 hours) per week.  
iii. Electronic dose monitored non-persistence: Number of gaps ( at least 7 consecutive days 
(168 hours) between doses) in the intervals: week 0-12, >12-24, >24-36 and >36-48.  
5 Primary outcome measure analysis : short term virologic success at Week 12  
The primary objective of the study is to estimate and compare HIV virol ogic suppression rates 
(HIV-1 RNA < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml and <200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) [ADDRESS_616195]-to-follow -up as failures ,   Sensitivity analyses will repeat the primary 
analysis (i) using observ ed HIV -1 RNA only (participants with missing week 12 HIV -1 RNA not 
included in denominator), (ii) using a wider window around the Week 12 study visit, and (iii ) using 
last observed HIV -1 RNA if missing week 12.  
Virologic success rates in each arm and the diffe rence in success rates between arms will be 
summarized with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) .   Analyses adjusting for covariates identified a 
priori by [CONTACT_479800].   
[ADDRESS_616196].  The analytic approach will be similar 
to the primary outcome measure outlined in Section 5 , conducting comparisons by [CONTACT_479801] 
24, 36 and 48, but with wi der allowable windows (±28 days) around each study visit , and 
excluding participants who die for reasons unrelated to HIV before each timepoint .  If more than 
one HIV -[ADDRESS_616197] value will 
be chosen.  Sensitivity analyses will repeat the primary analysis (i) using observed HIV -1 RNA 
only (participants with missing week HIV -1 RNA not included in denominator), (ii) using a wider 
window around the study visit, and (ii i) using last observed HIV -1 RNA .  An analys is combining 
data from Weeks 24, 36 and 48 will use generalized linear models to account for the repeated 
measures for each participant.    
TERA  Primary Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Version 3 June 24, 2020 
Page 8 of 10 6.2 Achieving and maintaining virologic success over 48 weeks 
This outcome measure is achieving virologic success (HIV -1 RNA < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) at Week 12 
(±14 days) and maintaining virologic suppression through Weeks 24, 36 and 48 (all ±28 days).  
Success rates will be summarized and compared using the same approach as for the primary 
outcome measure, and excludi ng participants who die for reasons unrelated to HIV before Week 
48.   
6.3 Adherence 
The Electronic Dose Monitoring ( EDM ) Device will capture whether participants opened the 
device (and presumably took their designated antiretroviral ) and if it was  within the allowable 
window (±4 hours) each day while on study.  It is not possible to identify when doses were missed 
due to EDM functionality, lost or stolen device s, or lack of access to the EDM device due to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_297568].  This means that adherence may be under -estimated in each 
arm.  However since these situations should arise equally in the two arms, comparisons between 
arms should be unbiased.    
6.3.1 Percent of days with doses taken per week  
For each 24-hour window (defined as midnight to midnight), a participant will be classified as having taken their dose if they opened the EDM device, regardless of when in the 24-hour period.  
For each week (defined as day of study entry (e.g. Monday) plus 6 days (e.g. Sunday)), the 
percent of days with a dose taken out of days with data in that week will be calculated.  These 
percentages  will be summarized across participants in each arm by [CONTACT_479802] a 
Figure.  To address the issue of possible informative censoring of participants lost -to-follow-up for 
reasons other than death, a  second summary will use available data while the participant is on 
study , and imput e 0% for each week after a participant has been lost -to-follow -up and up to the 
earlier of March 20, [ADDRESS_616198] -to-follow -up before 12 weeks will be 
assigned an interval between the number of doses recorded as taken (minimum possible 
assuming no further doses taken through full 12 weeks of follow -up) and that number plus the 
difference between 84 days (12 weeks) and the day  they were lost -to-follow -up (maximum 
possible assuming all further doses taken through full 12 weeks of follow -up).  Arms will be 
compared using a generalized logrank test.  Note that this approach is different from the one 
outlined in the protocol which proposed using repeated measures rank sum tests to compare 
adherence between a rms, as this approach relied on having complete data.  A similar approach 
will be used to summarize adherence in the post -intervention phase (weeks >12 –  48), with the 
caveat that participants lost -to-follow -up before Week [ADDRESS_616199] -intervention 
summaries.   
6.3.2 Percent of days with doses taken within defin ed acceptable windows per week  
For each 24-hour window (defined as midnight to midnight ), a participant will be classified as 
having taken their doses on time if they opened the EDM device within the allowable ±[ADDRESS_616200] as the outcome in Section 6.3.1.  Ability 
TERA  Primary Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Version 3 June 24, 2020 
Page 9 of 10 to determine if the dose was taken ‘on time’ will depend on the target dose times being correct 
and updated in real time in the EDM  device.   
6.3.3 Electronic dose monitored non -persistence 
The outcome measure will be calculated during each 12-week interval (0-12, >12-24, >24-36, 
>36-48) as the number of 7 -day gaps between doses relative to the number of week s with EDM 
data reported times 12.  This represents an incidence rate (IR) for numbers of gaps of 7 days per 
12 week s on study.   For example, each consecutive gap of  7 days will increase the participant’s 
count by [CONTACT_31806], i.e . missing [ADDRESS_616201] gaps (regardless of length) and the lengt h of each gap are of interest. 
The number of participants with at least one gap, the number of gaps regardless of length , and 
the maximum gap length will be summarized.  I ncidence rates wi ll be summarized for each 12-
week interval  and compared within and across  the four 12-week intervals by [CONTACT_479803] a Poisson link. This analysis does not take into account participants lost -to-follow -up and results will  need to be interpreted with caution.

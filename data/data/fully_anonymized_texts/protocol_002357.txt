SCHEMA  
Purpose:  The purpose of this study is to develop and assess the efficacy of an integrated strategy 
that includes feasible and scalable interventions to identify, rec ruit, link to care, retain 
in care, attain , and maintain viral suppression among HIV -infected men who have sex 
with men (MSM) in the [LOCATION_002] (US).  
Design:  This study will use deep -chain respondent driven sampling (DC -RDS)  and direct 
recruitment  (DR) to identify and recruit HIV -infected MSM who are not virally 
suppressed. A subset of these men will be enrolled in to one of two study arms. The 
intervention arm will provide a  Case Manager (CM) intervention package designed to 
enhance linkage to care, anti retroviral treatment (ART) initiation,  treatment adherence  
and retention in care. The control arm will provide the standard of care (SOC) for 
linkage to care, initiation of ART, treatment  adherence and retention in care . The 
primary outcome of the study is  viral suppression , [ADDRESS_529641] of the CM intervention on HIV incidence and to estimate the 
level of identification, linkage, ART coverage and viral suppression that would be 
required to achieve a substantial reduction in  HIV incidence among MSM in the US 
settings where the study is conducted.  
Intervention:  The study intervention [MyLife, MyChoices, MyCare  (Step 1) , My Care  (Step 2), and 
MyHealth ] is a program designed to enhance linkage , ART initiation, adherence and 
reten tion in care for MSM diagnosed with HIV.  It will be administered by a trained CM 
and will include health care and supportive services navigation, adherence counseling, 
and tailored support for care engagement and treatment adherence.  
Population:  HIV-infected and HIV -uninfected adolescent ( > 16 years old) and adult MSM , 
including transgender women, in selected US cities will be screened for this study. 
Enrollment will be limited to HIV -infected men who are not virally suppressed.  
Study Size:  Appro ximately [ADDRESS_529642] 
strategies in four cities; 3 56 HIV-infected MSM who are not virally suppressed will be 
randomized (1:1) to the CM intervention and SOC control study arms of the study.   
Study Regimen : There are no specific drug regimens under investigation in this study.  
Study Duration:  The overall study duration is 60 months: 24 months for DC -RDS recruitment and 
enrollment; 2 4 months of follow -up for participants who are randomized into the CM 
intervention and SOC control study arms; and approximately 12 months after the 
completion of participant study visits for data analyses, phylogenetic assessments and 
modeling.  
Study Sites:  Alabama Vaccine  Research Center  (Birmingham, AL); Fenway Health  ([LOCATION_011], MA); 
Johns Hopkins Adult AIDS (Baltimore, MD) ; and the Ponce de Leon Ctr  (Atlanta, GA)

SCHEMA (Continued)  
Primary Objectives:  
• Assess the ability of DC -RDS to identify and recruit HIV -infected MSM in the US who are 
not virally suppressed.  
• Compare the efficacy of the two study arms ( CM intervention vs. SOC  control ) in achieving 
durable viral suppression (defined as HIV VL < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) 24 months after enrollment.  
Secondary Objectives:   
• Assess HIV prevalence and the proportion of HIV-infected men who are virally suppressed 
by [CONTACT_419986] ( approximately 1-6) vs. late r (deep) wave ( approximately 7-12) 
DC-RDS par ticipants.  
• Compare the proportion of men in the two study arms who are virally suppressed at 3, 6 , 9, 
12 and 18 months after enrollment .  
• Assess linkage to care and retention in care in the two study arms by [CONTACT_419987] 
1) proportion of men with at least  one care visit within 30 days of enrollment, 2) time to the 
first care visit, and 3) proportion of men with at least four care visits (one in each six-month  
interval , with at least 60 days between these visits ) over the 24 months  after enrollment . 
• Compare the proportion of men with HIV -hepatitis C virus (HCV) co -infection in the two 
study arms who are linked to care (defined as one care visit within 30 days  of enrollment ) and 
who achieve (HIV) viral suppression 2 4 months after enrollment . 
• Examine th e association between baseline behavioral, socio -demographic, and clinical 
characteristics (including syphilis) of HIV -infected men and viral suppression status for all 
men screened via DC -RDS and for the men in the two study arms 2 4 months after enrollmen t. 
• Compare the two study arms with respect to ART adherence at 24 months after enrollment 
and changes in sexual risk behavior, health care utilization, stigma, substance use and mental 
health from  baseline  to 24 months after enrollment . 
• Evaluate the feasibility and scalability of the CM intervention by [CONTACT_419988] ( e.g., text message, email, phone, in person) per participant over 2 4 
months.  
• Compare the experience of linkage to and ongoing HIV care among participants in the two 
study arms by [CONTACT_419989] .

SCHEMA (Continu ed) 
Exploratory Objectives:  
• Use phylogenetic methods to evaluate the relationship between HIV strains in study 
participants . Men who were likely to have been recently infected at enrollment  will be 
identified using a multi -assay algorithm. Evaluate the rel ationship of behavioral, socio -
demographic, and clinical characteristics to viral networks  (e.g., clusters, linked infections) . 
• Use laboratory assessments to characterize the study cohort and to evaluate the impacts of 
study interventions. These assessment s may include analysis of HIV drug resistance and 
antiretroviral (ARV) drug use. Additional analyses may be conducted to analyze HCV 
strains, including phylogenetic analysis of HCV. Samples from this study may also be used to 
evaluate the performance of as says related to HIV and HCV infection.   
Modeling Objective:  
• Develop, calibrate, and use a mathematical model of HIV transmission among MSM in the 
US to assess the short and long -term population -level impact of the study strategy, and its 
independent CM intervention components (e.g., HIV testing, ART uptake, retention in care 
and viral suppression), on HIV incidence and to estimate the level of viral suppression 
required to reduce HIV incidence in the MSM community by 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% over

Page 1 of 88 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background and Prior Research  
The [LOCATION_002] ( US) is currently undergoing a widespread and severe HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_419957], bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), which has been underway since at 
least 2003.[ADDRESS_529646] recent report, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) 
reported that 62% of all new infections in the US were among MSM, a group who represent at 
most 2 -4% of US adult men, and 1 -2% of all adults.2 The US epi[INVESTIGATOR_419958] —the only group among whom HIV infections burdens were rising in 2011. 
This epi[INVESTIGATOR_419959], with the highest HIV 
burdens among Black MSM, followed by [CONTACT_419990].[ADDRESS_529647] MSM, those aged 1 3-24.4 HPTN 061, an 
incidence study in Black MSM, found a 3% incidence rate overall in this population, with a 5.9% 
incidence rate in those [ADDRESS_529648] rates of i ncident HIV infection in Black , Latino,  and 
White MSM found in the South. These health disparities are not limited to HIV prevalence and 
incidence burdens, but rather are  also seen in lower rates of regular HIV testing, in lack of  
awareness of HIV status, in late presentation for HIV care, in poor adherence to antiretroviral

American MSM do less well across each step of this continuum, with an overall outcome of being 
half as likely to be fully virally suppressed if living with HIV infection compared to men of all  
other racial/ethnic categories.[ADDRESS_529650] be acceptable, feasible and scalable. This study will attempt to address 
two critical steps in the contin uum of care for MSM in the US: enhanced outreach and 
recruitment of MSM living with HIV infection but not virally su ppressed through d eep-chain 
respondent driven s ampling  (DC-RDS) ; and enhanc ed treatment and care to increase the 
proportion of MSM who achieve sustained viral suppression through a case  management (CM) 
intervention.  
1.1.1  The Need to Enhance Recruitment  
The US CDC estimates that 14% of Americans living with HIV infection remain undiagnosed 
and unaware of their HIV infection status.6 An additional 60% of those living with HIV are not 
currently in HIV care6—meaning that almost 7 0% of  persons in the US with HIV infection are 
not currently on treatment or virally suppressed. This is a challenge for the health of these 
individuals, but also represents a  pool of untreated HIV infections that drive ongoing 
transmission. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_419960], uptake of HIV 
testing remains too low in many communities, including among MSM, and is particularly 
challenging in minor ity communities and am ong younger age groups of MSM. Black MSM are 
nearly [ADDRESS_529651] compared to White MSM in the US.3 
Active recruitment, and the use of innovative techniques for recruitment, is an urgent HIV 
research priority for control ling HIV infection among MSM.  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 2 of 88 Respondent driven s ampling (RDS) has demonstrated effectiveness in reaching hard to sample 
populations, including among minor ity and low socio -economic status (SES) MSM in the US. 
Long Chain RDS, where referral chains are maintained over long waves of recruitment, is an 
innovative approac h that has the potential to reach more hidden, marginalize d and HIV -untested, 
unlinked, and not virally suppressed MSM living with HIV infection.   
1.1.2  Deep -Chain Respondent Driven Sampling (DC -RDS)  
RDS relies on the identification and enumeration of  a discrete number of “seeds” who are 
incentivized to refer members of their social or sexual networks, who then repeat the process, 
generating suc cessive waves of recruitment. RDS has been used successfully in the US and 
abroa d to recruit marginalized MSM . RDS studies have reported success in recruiting MSM who 
have very low incomes, are homeless, men engaged in sex work, non -gay-identifie d and/or 
bisexually active men .7, [ADDRESS_529652] in using this approach as a 
recruitment tool.11, 12 A novel secondary aim of the study will be to compare early ( approximately 
wave 1 -6) ver sus later ( approximately wave 7 -12) recruitment waves to assess the ability of 
DC-RDS to identify  HIV-infected MSM who are not virally suppres sed in the selected cities.

transmission among HIV serodiscordant couples. However, only 37 male -male discordant 
couples were recruited into HPTN 052 – with only one  male -male couple in the US. Furthermore, 
recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_419961], in many populations of MSM, primary 
partnerships account for only a minority (30 -35% in the PUMA  [Prevention Umbrella for MSM 
in the Americas]  modeling estimates ) of HIV transmissions, with the majority occurring betwee n 
non-primary sexual partners .[ADDRESS_529654] effe ctively through 
approaches based on discordant couples. Enhanced treatment of HIV -infected men within 
networks and at community levels  may be important in reducing the spread of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_419962].  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 3 of 88 1.1.4  Engagement in Care  among MSM in the US  
As there is a dearth of research on engagement -in-care strategies specific to the MSM population, 
challenges remain particularly prevalent among minority MSM in the US . Health care system 
navigation may offer a promising enga gement -in-care strategy for MSM .18 Among young MSM 
of color there is a particular need for strengthened and tailored strategies for retention in care with 
links to social supportive services due to the multiple challenges in this group (e.g., acc ess to 
health care, poverty, unemployment,  stigma) .19-[ADDRESS_529655] addresses challenges to HIV  
treatment and care; thus, the intervention  package for linkage, retention  and treatment adherence, 
with ca se management at its core , will draw from several e vidence -based interventions .22-[ADDRESS_529656] (ACA) , and the 
uncertainty about the continuation of the ACA in some states , care coordination must include 
negotiating affordable care options available to study participants.  
Behavioral interventions with the strongest beneficial impact on treatment adherence are 
cognitive -behavioral counseling interventions with a primary focu s on treatment adherence .30-[ADDRESS_529657] disproportionately affected population for HIV in the US, and there is an 
urgent need t o develop innovative strategies to address this health disparity  across the continuum 
of care. Sex between men accounted for an estimated 62% of new ly identified  HIV infections in 
the US in 2012, according to the US CDC , making enhancement of the effective ness of 
engagement in care and treatment for MSM of primary importance for controlling the US 
domestic HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]. This study is focused on US urban MSM living with HIV infection who 
are not successfully virally suppressed . All MSM  identified as HIV -infected and not virally 
suppressed will be offered linkage to care and immediate ART —an option not available in many 
other settings with severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_419963]. Since current HPTN sites, and concentrations 
of MSM in the US are primarily urban, this study will focus on urban MSM populations but may 
yield insights of relevance to improving outcomes for sub -urban and rural MSM in the US.  
The recruitment c omponent of this study will help refine the designs of future research and 
program efforts to enhance outr each, increase testing upta ke and increase linkage for 
HIV-infected MSM w ho are not virally suppressed. This p opulation includes all MSM with 
non-suppressed HIV viral load s, including men who are HIV -infected and not previously 
diagnosed, men who are aware  of their HIV infection but not currently linked to care, and men 
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.[ADDRESS_529658] been in care, or are currently in care, but are not su ccessfully virally suppressed. 
Men in all of these groups who meet enrollment criteria will be offered enrollment in the 
enhanced case management intervention f or linkage, retention, treatment initiation and 
medication adherence. DC-RDS will be assessed for its efficacy in reaching more hidden, 
marginalized, previously undiagnosed, and HIV -infected and not viral ly suppressed M SM. Future 
trials of enhanced treatment interventions, and of Treatment as Prevention (TasP) at community 
levels among MSM, will depend on the ability to reach these challenging subsets of MSM and to 
link them to care and treatment.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_419964], current data on success across the HIV treatment cascade demonstrates a need to 
improve both access to care and treatment adherence.  Interventions to ensure MSM living with 
HIV and not virally suppressed are linked to and remain in care to achieve virologic control are 
limited and h ave had mixed results.39, [ADDRESS_529659] 
demonstrated substantial improvements in disease outcomes , including HIV.  
The Chronic Care Model (CCM) identifies essential elements of a health care system that 
encourage high -quality chronic disease care i n a bundled approach .41, 44-[ADDRESS_529660] component of incident HIV infections in the country.  
Phylogenetic analysis  of HIV infections among MSM could add important insights to the 
outreach and r ecruitment aims of this study. Since DC-RDS is a chain referral approach that is 
dependent on social and sexual networks, and participants recruit their net work members for 
iterative recruitment waves, DC -RDS allows for the construction of network chain s of referral 
and relatedness. As recruitment waves propagate beyond initial seeds, recruitment goes further 
into populations, eventually reaching significant proportions of populations with shared 
characteristics and who are connected t hrough social networks. The ability to assess linkages at 
viral levels within these networks may provide critical insights into HIV transmission dynamics 
in urban MSM communities . 
  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 5 of 88 2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND  DESIGN  
2.1 Primary Objectives  
The primary objectives of the study are to:  
• Assess the ability of DC -RDS to identify and recruit HIV -infected MSM in the US who are 
not virally suppressed.  
• Compare the efficacy of the two study arms ( CM intervention vs. SOC  control ) in achieving  
durable  viral suppression (defined as HIV VL < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) 2 4 months after enrollment.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of the study are to:  
• Assess HIV prevalence and the proportion of HIV -infected  men who are virally suppressed 
by [CONTACT_419986] (approximately 1 -6) vs. later (deep) wave (approximately 7 -12) 
DC-RDS participants.  
• Compare the proportion of men in the two study arms who are virally suppressed at 3, 6 and 
9, 12 and 18 months after  enrollment.  
• Assess linkage to care and retention in care in the two study arms by [CONTACT_17921] 
1) proportion of men with at least one care visit within 30 days of enrollment, 2) time to the 
first care visit, and 3) proportion of men with at least four care visits (one in each six month  
interval , with at least 60 days between these visits) over the 24 months  after enrollment.  
• Compare the proportion of men with HIV -hepatitis C virus (HCV) co -infection in the two 
study arms who are linked to care (defined as one care visit within 30 days of enrollment) and 
who achieve (HIV) viral suppression 2 4 months after enrollment.  
• Examine the association between baseline behavioral, socio -demographic, and clinical 
characteristics (including syphilis) of HIV -infected me n and viral suppression status for all 
men screened via DC -RDS and for the men in the two study arms 2 4 months after enrollment.  
• Compare the two study arms with respect to ART adherence at 24 months after enrollment 
and changes in sexual risk behavior, hea lth care utilization, stigma, substance use and mental 
health from  baseline  to 24 months after enrollment.  
• Evaluate the feasibility and scalability of the CM intervention by [CONTACT_419988] (e.g., text message, email, phone, i n person) per participant over 2 4 
months.  
• Compare the experience of linkage to and ongoing HIV care among participants in the two 
study arms by [CONTACT_419989] .  
2.3 Exploratory Objectives  
The exploratory objectives of the study are to:  
• Use phylogenetic methods to evaluate the relationship between HIV strains in study 
participants . Men who were likely to have been recently infected at enrollment  will be 
identified using a multi -assay algorithm. Evaluate the relationship of behavioral, socio -
demographic, and clinical characteristics to viral networks  (e.g., clusters, linked infections) .   
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 6 of 88 • Use laboratory assessments to characterize the study cohort and to evaluate the impacts of 
study interventions.  These assessments may include analysis of HIV drug resistance and 
antiretroviral (ARV) drug use. Additional analyses may be conducted to analyze HCV 
strains, including phylogenetic analysis of HCV. Samples from this study may also be used to 
evaluate the performance of assays related to HIV and HCV infection.   
2.4 Modeling Objective  
The modeling objective of the study is to:  
• Develop, calibrate, and use a mathematical model of HIV transmission among MSM in the 
US to assess the short and long -term population -level impact of the study strategy, and its 
independent CM intervention components (e.g., HIV testing, ART uptake, retention in care 
and viral suppression), on HIV incidence and to estimate the level of viral suppression 
required to reduce HIV incidence in t he MSM community by 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% over 
2, 5 and 10 years, and the likelihood of and time to elimination.  
2.5 Study Design  
The overall design of this study reflects the primary goal, which is to develop and assess an 
integrated scalable strategy to ide ntify, recruit, link to care, retain in  care, and achieve HIV viral 
suppression among urban US MSM who are HIV -infected and not successfully virally 
suppressed. To outreach, identify and recruit HIV -infected MSM who are not virally suppressed, 
DC-RDS  and D R will be implemented in four US cities  (Atlanta, GA; Baltimore, MD; 
Birmingham, AL; and [LOCATION_011], MA) . Participating cities will have HPTN sites with evidence of 
high HIV burdens among MSM and interest in participating in the study. DC -RDS has been 
shown to  be effective in reaching and identifying hard to reach subsets of MSM, including low 
SES, non -gay identified, and ethnic and racial minority MSM who are less likely be in HIV care 
and to be virally suppressed. The primary outcome of the recruitment compon ent of the study is 
to assess the ability of DC -RDS to identify and recruit HIV -infected MSM in the US who are not 
virally suppressed.  
MSM recruited through DC -RDS who meet enrollment criteria will be randomized (1:1) to one of 
two study arms. The interven tion arm will provide a  Case Manager (CM) intervention package 
designed to enhance linkage to care, antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation, treatment 
adherence and retention in care using a case manag ement -based intervention. The SOC control 
arm will provide the standard of care (SOC) for linkage to care, initiation of ART, treatment 
adherence and retention in care. The primary outcome of the CM intervention phase is viral 
suppression 24 months  after enrollment .  
Phylogenetic methods will be used to evaluate the relationship between viral strains in study 
participants and the relationship of viral networks (e.g., clusters, linked infections) to behavioral, 
socio -demographic, and clinical characteristics . Mathematical modeling will be p erformed using 
demographic, behavioral, and clinical data generated from this study and other sources to 
estimate the population -level impact of the CM intervention on HIV incidence and to estimate the 
level of identification, linkage, ART coverage and vir al suppression that would be required to 
achieve a substantial reduction in HIV incidence among MSM in the US settings where the study 
is conducted.    
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 7 of 88 3.0 STUDY POPULATION  
Approximately 2 700 sexually  active MSM ( ~675 in each participating city) will be recruit ed for 
HIV testing via DC -RDS  and direct recruitment  (DR) . The study’s focus is on cis gender MSM ; 
however,  transgender women who meet eligibility criteria will be included . Out of this cohort, 
356 HIV-infected MSM who are not virally suppressed  and meet the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria described below  will be enrolled  into the CM intervention and SOC control study arms . 
3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Individuals who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for study screening : 
• Biological male (at  birth)  
• Self-report of history of anal intercourse  with another man   
• 16 years or older   
Individuals who  are eligible for screening and who  meet all of the following criteria are eligible 
for enrollment into the CM intervention and SOC control arms :  
• HIV-infected, as defined in the HPTN 078 Study -Specific Procedures ( SSP) Manual  
• Not virally suppressed ( defined as HIV VL > 1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml ) 
• Can receive HIV care at one of the participating  clinic s (as chosen by [CONTACT_25733] ) 
• No current  plan to relocate in the  24 months  following enrollment  
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Individuals who meet any of the following cri teria will be excluded from study  screening : 
• Unable or unwilling to provide consent /assent  for study participation  
• Active or previous participation in an HIV vacci ne trial  
• Any condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_419965]  (IoR) , would make 
participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome data, or 
otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives.  
Individuals who  are eligible for screening, but who  meet the following criteria are excluded from 
enrollment into the CM intervention and SOC control arms:  
• Current participation in a linkage or ART adherence study  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 8 of 88 3.3 Recruitment Process  
DC-RDS will be used to recruit MSM in to this study , to the extent possible . In this method, seeds 
will be identified  by [CONTACT_25733].  Seeds will be the individuals who begi n the recruitment chains ; 
they will  be selected to represent a range of characteristics  (including ethnic and racial minorit y 
status)  and because they are well -networked within the population. These seeds will undergo 
training to become a recruiter. They will then be given coupons with which t o recruit others  to the 
study. Seeds must meet the  screening  inclusion/exclusion crite ria of the study and are considered 
study participants.  
As this protocol is testing the ability of DC -RDS methodology to find HIV -positive, MSM  who 
are not virally suppressed , DC -RDS recruitment will continue throughout the duration of the 
screening and enrollment period. However, DR will be used in addition to DC -RDS to fully 
enroll the CM intervention investigation. These new participants may be treated as seeds, if a site 
still needs to initiate additional recruitment chains. There will be no difference in study 
procedures for participants recru ited via DC -RDS or DR, except that those identified via  DR may 
or may not be treated as seeds, and thus, may or may not distribute coupons to others.  
All seeds,  and subsequent participant/recruiters, must not recruit anyone other than peers they 
know pers onally who are MSM . These recruits will come to the site and, if they are eligible and 
agree to participate, will undergo the study’s screening procedures  before becoming recruiters 
themselves. P articipants  will return to the clinic to  be reimbursed for th e coupons that were 
brought back to the clinic by [CONTACT_419991] . In addition,  a post -recruitment questionnaire will be 
administered to characterize how many people in total were approached in the distribution of the 
coupons and the characteristics ( e.g., age, race) of those who did and did not accept a coupon.  
If necessary, more than [ADDRESS_529661] to achieve the required 
sample size for enrollment .   
3.4 Co-Enrollment Guidelines  
Participants will not be eligible for study participatio n (screening or enrollment)  if they are 
actively or have ever been en rolled in an HIV vaccine trial,  since this may affect the anti -HIV 
antibody profile, complicating HIV diagnosis, and use of cross -sectional methods to identify men 
who may have been recently infected at the time of enrollment . Participants will not be eligible 
for enrollment into the  CM intervention and SOC control arms  if they are currently participating 
in a linkage or ART adherence study. Once randomized, participants cannot be co -enrolled into 
other linkage or ART adherence studies.  
3.5 Participant Retention  
Locator information will be collected from each participant, so that they can be found if their 
phone number or address changes.  Each site will be asked to create a retention plan to maximize 
the level of participation in study -required visits ( follow -up visits and the final visit); however, 
sites will use their standard -of-care for retaining participants in clinical care throughout the study. 
The HPTN [ADDRESS_529662] their safety, and/or if participants are unable or 
unwilling to comply with study procedures. Participants also may be withdrawn if the study 
sponsors, government or re gulatory authorities or site Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ) 
terminate the study prior to its planned end date. Every reasonable effort will be made to 
complete a final evaluation (M2 4 visit procedures) of participants who terminate from the study 
prior  to Month [ADDRESS_529663] the reason(s) for all withdrawals in participant

Page 11 of 88 Figure 1: Relationship between the HIV Care Cascade and the CM Int ervention  
 
The CM will help each participant enrolled into the CM intervention arm to link to HIV care, 
initiate ART, remain adherent to medication and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_419966]. Each CM will 
have prior case management experience and will be trained to carry out the specified intervention 
aimed at improving disease m anagement and reducing HIV viral load for patients with HIV. The 
CM-to-participant ratio will be approximately 1:42 over the 2 4-month period. As  shown in Figure 
2, the frequency, content and type (in person, email, phone, text message) of interactions will  be 
driven by [CONTACT_6904]’s desire and need for support, but will minimally follow the schedule of 
events (see Appendix I). All CM -participant interactions will be documented (frequency and 
duration) to assess the feasibility and scalability of the CM intervention. To ensure uniformity 
and fidelity of the intervention across sites, each CM will undergo a standardized, comprehensive 
training program , and each mandatory session (at required study visits) will be audio recorded 
and a small percentage will be assessed against a standard counselling index , as described in the 
HPTN 078 SSP  Manual .  

 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 12 of 88 Figure 2: Overview of CM -Administered Study Intervention  
 
Note: Some participants may choose to meet in person with the CM on a very frequent basis (e.g. 
weekly); these visit s will be documented , however, such visits are not mandatory and there are no 
required study procedures during them.   
 
This CM -led model builds upon the existing CDC -endorsed Comprehensive Risk Counseling and 
Services for Persons with HIV63, which focuses on the prevention of HIV transmission. The 
model combines aspect of clinical care coordination to include; a) recruitment and engagement 
(MyLife); b) inve ntory of available resources (MyChoices); c) patient navigation to clinical care 
(MyCare  (Step 1) ); d) adherence counseling (MyCare  (Step 2); e) retention and follow -up 
(MyHealth).  
The approach of the CM follows an approach similar to HPTN [ADDRESS_529665] adherence and retention in care, which has 
been effectively demonstrated in women living with  HIV, but not in an MSM group.65 The role of 
the CM within each of the five components is described below.  
Participants enrolled into the SOC control arm will be provided with the existing programs for 
referral to HIV treatment and suppor t services without additional CM  coordination.

Page 13 of 88 4.1 Linkage to Care and ART Initiation  (MyLife, MyChoices, MyCare  (Step 1) ) 
4.1.1  Engagement (MyLife)  
The MyLife component is the first step of the CM intervention as developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a therapeutic or 
interpersonal relationship with the participan t is the paramount first step. Engaging with the 
participant is an effective strategy that has been shown to improve retention .58 Part of this 
engagement process is to attempt to understand the participant’s state of mind after the HIV 
diagnosis and address any HIV -related questions they may have. It may become necessary to end 
the first session here depending on the individuals needs related to their diagnosis.  This session 
will include an HIV counseling intervention about the new dia gnosis and an overview of the case 
management  model in support of the patient. The CM will be taught motivational interviewing 
skills to facilitate participant enga gement into clinical practice.  
After the initial question -answer period, the CM will seek to understand the predisposing, 
enabling and health needs of the participant .[ADDRESS_529666] the 
participant to develop an individually -tailored plan that is designed utilizing self -determination 
theory. Self-determination theory is anchored by [CONTACT_419992]: (1) autonomy 
support -provision of evidence -based health guidance and  supporting the participant -endorsement 
of the plan they believe best meets their needs and fits within their life circumstance; (2) 
competence support -expression of belief in the participant s’ ability  to implement their self-
endorsed plan and provision of  guidance for acquiring the necessary skills and resources for 
successful implementation; and (3) relational support -expression/demonstration of genuine care 
and concern for the participant ’s successful implementation of the plan (e.g., follow -up 
phone/tex t check -ins). These three components are theorized to facilitate the adoption and 
maintenance of health behaviors. A comprehensive training program on the use of this model will 
be provided to all CMs.  
4.1.2  Inventory of Available Resources (MyChoices)  
MyC hoices will involve a discussion of resources available to meet the participants stated 
healthcare needs. The CM will have a comprehensive listing of available HIV, substance abuse, 
mental health, and other available resources to discuss with the participa nt. The CM will provide 
guidance on options that work within the delineated plan and make modifications based on the 
participant’s needs and review of the available resources.  
4.1.3  Patient Navigation to Clinical Care (MyCare  (Step 1) ) 
MyCare (Step 1) supports the decision to initiate HIV care and will include motivational 
interviewing activities to coach the client toward seeking and initiating care. Once care decisions 
have been made by [CONTACT_2299], the CM will offer to facilitate entry into the care facility 
selected by [CONTACT_102]. This will include the establishment of necessary appointments, facilitation 
of paperwork and registration materials, pre -clinical laboratory evaluations, evaluation of 
provider options within the clinical site as well as introductions of the clinical team through either 
website review, phone calls, or a clinic visit with onsite team prior to the first visit.  All 
participants will be encouraged to initiate ( or re-initiate) ART in consultation with their 
healthcare provid er. 
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 14 of 88 4.2 Adherence Counseling (MyCare (Step 2) ) 
In conjunction with ART initiation, the  CM will deliver evidence -based adherence counseling, 
which will be modeled after Life Steps31, a single -session intervention that is grounded in 
cognitive -behavioral principles that are at the core of several successful ART adhe rence 
interventions.25, 32, 62, 66 The adherence counseling will address basic education about HIV and 
ART, planning and problem -solvi ng for accessing and maintaining a steady supply of medication, 
formulation of a daily medication schedule, cues for pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -taking, copi[INVESTIGATOR_419967]/or 
other patient concerns, developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a plan to mitigate side effects, and responses to slips in 
adherence. This counseling will be provided face -to-face prior to, at the time of , or in the very 
early stage of  ART initiation. Participants will be encouraged to bring a support partner to the 
adherence counseling sessions, if they so desire, which has b een shown to be effective for long -
term me dication adherence .62, 66, 67 The counseling intervention allows for tailoring to the 
participants specific needs, as well as additional counseling sessions, if needed. MyCare  (Step 2) 
adds to this evidence -based approach by [CONTACT_419993] a personal 
choice that is grounded in a variety of behavioral and psychosocial domains. Intention to adhere 
to treatment will be added as part of the MyCare  (Step 2) component .61 
4.3 Communication, Retention and Follow -up (MyHealth)  
MyHealth is based on the premise that a ll patient s engaged in self -management and supportive 
strategies will feel more  empowered to take ownership of their own healthcare needs. In addition, 
there is accumulated evidence for the acceptability and preference for two -way text messaging for 
adherence support among diverse populations, including MSM.35-38  As such, t ailored 
communication support will be offered  to facilitate ongoing adherence. The CM will work with 
each participant to determine their desire for suppor tive adherence reminder s, their preferred 
method of communication (te xt message, email or phone call ), and the frequency and schedule 
for these messages.  In this way, t he participant  is being empowered to take the lead with 
recommendations and guidance from the CM. This type of messagin g is interactive in that it 
allows for a response from participants, in case a participant needs additional information or 
assistance. The frequency and content of these  communications  may change over the course of 
the intervention, depending on the needs of the participant.

Page 15 of 88 5.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
An overview of the study visits and procedures is presented in Appendix I . Additional 
information is provided below on visit -specific study procedures. Detailed instructions to guide 
and standardize all study procedure s across sites will be provided in the SSP Manual.  
5.1 Screening Visits  
There are several  algorithms for screening visits  (see HPTN 078 SSP Manual ). The timing of 
screening activities will vary between algorithms, but all screening activities described below will 
be completed for each algorithm.  Additionally, re-screening for eligibility is allowed under 
certain circumstances ( see HPTN 078 SSP Manual).  
All individuals will be consented for screening procedures,  which include  the provision of contact 
[CONTACT_3031], completion of  several questionna ires (see Appendix II) and samples collected  for 
laboratory assessments. All participants will undergo HIV screening (via one Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA )-approved HIV rapid test [either oral fluid or fing er stick  or whole blood ], 
self-report, or clinic record) and have blood drawn for HCV and syphilis testing. For those who 
report being previously diagnosed with HIV infection, have HIV infection documented in a clinic 
record, or have a reactive rapid HIV t est, additional blood will be collected for HIV confirmatory 
testing  (see HPTN 078 SSP Manual) , HIV viral load and CD4+ cell count. In addition, pre - and 
post-test HIV counseling and HIV/ sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk reduction counseling 
will b e provided to all participants, as appropriate. Participants will also be assessed for social 
impacts that may have occurred during the recruitment process .  
Participants who participate  in DC -RDS will also be given instructions about the recruitment 
proce ss and coupons for distribution . Additionally, if applicable at later visits, a post -recruitment 
questionnaire will be administered to DC-RDS participants who have distributed their coupons.  
All p articipants , regardless of eligibility,  may be provided wit h their test results by  [CONTACT_419994]-person, per site standards.  If the HCV and/or syphilis test are  positive, participants will be 
referred for care  via site standards . Participants who are eligible and willing to enroll may be 
provided with their  test res ults in-person on the day of their  enrollment visit.  
5.1.1 Procedures for Participants Who are Determined  to be HIV -Uninfected  
Participants who are determined  to be HIV -uninfected (see HPTN 078 SSP Manual) will be given 
information on HIV prevention, including current information about pre-exposure prophylaxis 
(PrEP ) and post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP). These participants are not eligible for enrollment  
into the CM intervention  or SOC control arms .  
5.1.2 Procedures for Participants Who are Confirmed to be HIV -Infected  
Participants who are confirmed to be HIV -infected  (see HPTN 078 SSP Manual)  will be screened 
for participation in the intervention, and , if eligible, will be invited to be enrolled  into the CM 
intervention or SOC control arms . If an individual is eligible for randomization, but chooses not 
to participate further in the study, they will be referred to local HIV care facilities.  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.[ADDRESS_529667]  screening visit will be referred to a local 
care provider for further evaluation and follow -up.  If such a participant  is later confirmed to be 
HIV-infected, they may be re -assessed for eligibilit y (see HPTN 078 SSP Manual).  
5.2 Enrollment Visit  (M0)  
The Enrollment Visit will take place as soon as participants are determined to be eligible.  During 
this visit , participants will be consented for enrollment and randomized to either th e CM 
intervention  or SOC control arm. Participants will be asked to sign a release of medical 
information, their locator information will be confirmed , they will be asked to complete a 
questionnaire  (see Appendix II) , and they will have blood drawn for plasma storage . All 
participants will be offered HIV testing for their partners. Depending on the results of the 
partners ’ HIV test results, partners  will be referred to appropriate HIV care services or other HIV -
related studies. [Note: partner testing will be done outsid e of the study and results will not be 
recorded.] In addition, the intervention will begin at this visit for those ran domized to the CM 
intervention arm, and, if appropriate, ART may be initiated at this visit. (Note that ART is not 
provided by [CONTACT_1758], nor prescribed by [CONTACT_8888].)  
5.[ADDRESS_529668] 
will be made with participants in the SOC control arm.  
5.5 Follow -up Visits  (M3, M6, M9 , M12, M18 ) 
Follow -up Visits will take place at Months 3, 6, 9 , 12 and 18 for all participants ( CM intervention 
and SOC control arms) . During th ese face-to-face visit s, locator information will be confirmed,  
social impacts will be collected, partner HIV testing will be offered, HIV viral l oad and CD4 cell 
count testing will be conducted , and plasma will be stored . For those randomized to the CM 
intervention arm, the intervention will be implemented by [CONTACT_8888] . 
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 17 of 88 5.6 Final Visit  (M24) 
The Final Visit will take place at Month 2 4. This visit will be identical to a Follow -up Visit,  
except that blood will be collected for syphilis testing  and questionnaires will be administered 
(see Appendix II). An exit interview will also be conducted or scheduled with all participants.  If 
the syphilis test is positive, participants will be given their test  results and referred for care  via 
site standard s. An exit interview will be conducted with each CM after they complete the final 
visit for their last participant.  
5.[ADDRESS_529669] during study follow -up, and overall visit 
attendance will be collected from all participants ’ medical records.  
5.8 Questionnaires  
5.8.1  Participant Questionnaires  
Questionnaires in the following domains will be administered over the course of the study: 
demographic;  PrEP/PEP/ART use history;  HIV testing history;  sexual matrix module /sexual risk 
behavior ; health care utilization; engagement in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
(LGBT ) community; post recruitment questions; medication adherence; stigma; substance abuse; 
and ment al health. The schedule for these questionnaires is provided in Appendi x II. When 
possible, the  domain questionnaires will be  adapted from recent MSM -focused HPTN studies 
such as HPTN 061 and 073 to allow cross comparison . Additionally, validated questions /scales 
from the literature will be used to gain information in domains that are vital to understanding the 
impact of the study design and intervention . Information on the focus of each domain is provided 
below:  
• Demographic:  Data  collected in this domain w ill include information  such as age, gender, 
marital status, education, annual incom e, race /ethnicity  and health insurance status . 
• PEP/PrEP/ART: Information collected in this domain will focus on actual behaviors and use  
of PEP/PrEP /ART in the last 12 months. Daily and intermittent use of PrEP in the community 
will also be evaluated.  
• HIV testing history:  The HIV testing history domain will document how many times the 
participant has been tested for HIV in the past year and the month and year of the most recent 
HIV test.  In addition, this domain will document whether  the participant received the results 
and if so, the result of the test.  
• Sexual matrix module/Sexual risk b ehavior: Information collected within these domains 
will include  information on number of partners, frequency and types of sexual acts, and 
geography of the sexual experiences. This information will help identify sexual exposures  
inside and outside the defined community.  The questions in this domain wil l be adapted fro m 
both HPTN 061 and HPTN 073 as well as the Berry sexual activity matrix.68, 69 
• Health care utilizat ion: Information collected in this domain will include information on 
health care utilization and services and assess engagement at baseline. Trust between the 
clinician and patient will also be evaluated . Information in this domain will also be collected  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.[ADDRESS_529670] been accessed outside the 
study.   
• Engagement in the LGBT community:  Information collected in this domain will include 
information on how well people are engaged and connected in the LGBT com munity. This 
domain will supplement the post recruitment questions and allow the team to evaluate the 
effectiveness of DC -RDS in finding those connected and individuals that are hidden in the 
community. This may reveal any association with the likelihood o f being undiagnosed.  
• Post recruitment questions:  Information collected in this domain will focus on evaluating 
the effectiveness of DC -RDS and recruitment strategies by [CONTACT_4317].70, 71 
• Stigma:  Information collected in this domain will be very focused on self-stigma  
(internalized homo -negativity)  and HIV stigma (with consideratio n of impact on HIV testing 
and adherence) . This questionnaire domain is being adapted from Herek et al 1997.72 
• Substance abuse  and mental health : Information collected in this section will focus on 
depression, post -traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and substance abuse.  These assessments 
will be brief screeners that the case manager can use to intervene or provide referrals. T he 
Substance Abuse /Mental Illness Symptoms Screener (SAMISS)73, 74 will be the primary 
source for this domain.  
• Medication adherence: This domain will be self -reported medication adherence. A three -
item scale developed by [CONTACT_419995],75 which has recently been shown to be correlated with 
HIV viral load outcomes across different populations, will be used.  
• Exit Interview:  A questionnaire  and a semi -structure d qualitative interview will be 
administered to participants asking them to des cribe their experiences with linkage -to-care, 
adherence  and the CM  intervention; information  will be collected  from both arms about  
outside interventions/care.   Such exit interv iews will also be conducted with the CMs, with 
the questions tailored for their role in the study.  
5.8.[ADDRESS_529671] of care. These surveys will be administered annually to 
capture sites’ normal procedures throughout the duration of the study.

Page 19 of 88 6.0 SAFETY MONITORING AN D ADVERSE EVENT REPO RTING  
6.1 Safety Monitoring  
As this study only involves low -risk activities (recruitme nt activities; testing for HIV, HCV, and 
syphilis; questionnaires; support for linkage -to-care, care engagement and ART adherence) and 
contains no biomedical intervention or clinical care (ART prescription or other medical 
treatment), standard adverse even t reporting will not be undertaken. The study team will collect 
and report all social impacts that are brought to the attention of study staff members . Research staff 
will be trained to recognize and report social impacts as well as provided with referrals for 
counseling and social service support, if necessary. Reports of social impacts will be reviewed 
quarterly or more often, if indicated, and report ed to the DAIDS Medical Officer together with 
any actions that are taken. Social impacts will be summarized and reported to appropriate 
Institutional Review Boards ( IRB)(s) on an annual basis.  
Confidential HIV and STI surveillance reporting will be done ac cording to local regulations. 
Participants will be reminded of these requirements via the Informed Consent Form.   
6.[ADDRESS_529672] Reporting  
It is possible that participants' involvement in the study could become known to others, and that a 
social impact  may result (i.e., because participants could be perceived as being HIV -infected or at 
"high risk" for HIV infection). For example, participants could be treated unfairly, or could have 
problems being accepted by [CONTACT_18115]/or communities. A social  impact that is reported by 
[CONTACT_419996] (IoR) or designee to be serious or 
unexpected will be reported to the responsible site’s IRBs at least annually, or according to their 
individual requirements. Social impa cts will be collected and reported on case report f orms 
(CRFs) during regular visits. In the event that a participant reports a social impact, every effort 
will be made by [CONTACT_419997], and/or referral to appropriate resources for the safety of the participant. While 
maintaining participant confidentiality, study sites may engage their Community Advisory Board 
(CAB) in exploring the social context surrounding instances of social impac ts, to minimize the 
potential occurrence of such a harm.

Page 20 of 88 7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
7.1 Review of Study Design  
This study is designed to i) evaluate the utility of DC-RDS for finding HIV-infected MSM who 
are not virally suppressed, and ii) assess the eff icacy of an CM intervention package for linking 
HIV-infected MSM to care and, ultimately, achieving viral suppression. Approximately 2700 
MSM  will be  identified and recruited (see S ection s 7.2.1 and  7.6.1 for definition of recruitment) 
using DC -RDS  and DR strateg ies in four cities (~ 675 per city). We expect that approximately 378 
of these will be HIV -infected MSM who are not virally suppressed and that 3 56 of these will be 
willing to participate . These 3 56 individuals will be randomized to the CM intervent ion and SOC 
control study arms of the study. The CM intervention arm will provide a package designed to 
enhance linkage to care, ART initiation, treatment adherence , and retention in care. The 
intervention will be delivered by a trained CM. The SOC control  arm will provide the SOC  for 
linkage to care, initiation of ART, and treatment. The primary outcome of the study is viral 
suppression 24 months after enrollment .

details regarding the process of randomization will be included in the SSP Manual.  
7.5 Blinding  
Participants and study investigators will not be blinded to the randomization assignments.  
7.6 Data Analysis  
7.6.1  Primary Analysis  
To assess the ability of DC -RDS to recruit HIV-infected MSM who are not virally suppressed we 
will meas ure the proportion of the men that are recruited by [CONTACT_376198]-RDS (where recruitment is 
defined as providing a blood draw for HIV and HIV viral load  testing) who are HIV -infected and 
not virally suppressed. An estimate and a 95% confidence interval ( CI) based on RDS methods76 
will be reported.  MSM recruited via other methods will not be included in this analysis.  
Among the HIV -infected MSM who are enrolled and randomized we will compare the rates of 
viral suppression (defined as HIV VL <200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) at 24 months after enrollment . The 
absolute difference in the probability of viral suppression between  the CM intervention and SOC 
control arms and a 95% CI will be reported. A chi -squared test with a  two-sided alpha level of 
0.05 will be used for testing the hypothesis:  
Ho: No difference in suppression between arms  
Ha: Difference in suppression between arms  
The a nalysis will follow the intent to treat principle. If a participant drops out prior to [ADDRESS_529683] of diffe rent assumptions about the viral 
suppression status of those who drop out.  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 24 of 88 As a secondary analysis , we will repeat the above for the subgroup of randomized participants 
who are HCV seropositive at baseline.  
7.6.2  Secondary Analysis  
We will div ide the MSM  who are recruited into early and late r waves  of DC -RDS (the definition 
of “early” and “late” will be included in the statistical analysis plan) . We will use a two sample 
test of proportions (with standard errors  adjusted for RDS sampling;76) to compare i) the 
proportion HIV -infected and ii) the proportion HIV -infected and not suppressed, between the 
early and late r recruit s. MSM recruited via other methods will not be included in this analysis. A 
two-sided alpha level of 0.05 will be used for hypothesis testing.  
We will also repeat the analysis of HIV viral suppression (described in S ection 7.6.1) at 3, [ADDRESS_529684] study 
assessment will be used  for participants who drop out prior to a time point. Chi-squared tests with 
a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 will be used at each time point.  
Among the HIV -infected MSM who are enrolled and randomized , we will compare the rates of 
linkage to care (defined as at least one care visit within 3 0 days of enrollment ) between the CM 
intervention and SOC control arm. Any randomized participant who drops out o f the study prior 
to 30 days  will be counted as “not linked” for the purpose of this analysis. The absolute difference 
in the probability of linkage between the CM intervention and SOC control arms and a 95% CI 
will be reported. A chi -squared test with a  two-sided alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_529685] ratio and 95% CI will be reported. Both analys es will 
follow the int ent to treat principle.  
We will also compare the proportion of MSM who are retained  in care (defined as at least four 
care visits [one in each six-month  interval , with at lea st 60 days between these visits] over the 2 4 
months after enrollment ) between the CM intervention and SOC control arm. Any randomized 
participant who drops out of the study without at least two care visits as defined above will be 
counted as “not retained ” for the purpose of this analysis. The absolute difference in the 
probability of retention between the CM intervention and SOC control arms and a 95% CI will be 
reported. A chi -squared test with a  two-sided alpha level of 0.05 will be used for hypothesis 
testing. The analysis will follow the intent to treat principle.  
We will build a mu ltiple logistic regression model to examine the associations between viral 
suppression at 2 4 months (outcome ) and various demographic characteristics, sexual risk 
behaviors and clinical characteristics. Further details will be provided in a separate Statis tical 
Analysis Plan.  
Additional analyses will examine the effect of the CM intervention on various sexual risk 
behavior, ART adherence, stigma, health care use, substance use and mental health measures over 
the 2 4 month follow -up. The general approach to t hese analyses will be to build a regression 
model (linear, log, or logistic, whichever is appropriate for the scale of the measure) that uses the 
24 month value of the measure as the outcome  (or most recent assessment for participants that 
drop out prior t o 24 months)  and includes the baseline value of the measure  (except for ART 
adherence, where no baseline value is available)  and CM intervention arm as covariates. The 
coefficient of the CM intervention arm covariate will be used to quantify the CM interve ntion 
effect. An estimate of the CM intervention effect and a 95% CI will be provided for each 
outcome. Further details will be provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 25 of 88 Among those randomized to the CM intervention arm we will measure the number o f contacts 
(text message, email, phone, in person) per participant over follow -up. Summary statistics (mean, 
median, interquartile range, etc .), standardized by [CONTACT_419998] -up, will be 
provided.  
We will summarize the distribution of responses on satisfaction with and usefulness of the CM 
intervention components from the exit interviews using means, medians and interquartile ranges.

7.6.4  Exploratory Analysis  
Phylogenetic trees will be built using HIV sequences from study participants and other relevant 
sequences (e.g., controls). If viral networks are identified  (e.g., clusters, linked infections) , we 
will evaluate the relationship of behavioral, socio -demographic, and clinical characteristics to 
viral networks.  
If other exploratory laboratory assessments are performed (e.g., drug resistance, ARV drug use, 
HCV phylogenetics), the HPTN Laboratory C enter ( LC) will identify specific endpoints for 
analysis.

Written informed consent will be obtained from each study participant prior to conducting 
study -related procedures.  Each study site is responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study informed consent 
form for local use, based on the template s in Appendix  III, which de scribe  the purpose of the 
study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation, in accordance 
with all applicable regulations.  Based on local IRB approval and state law, sites may seek a 
waiver of parental consent for either th e DC -RDS activities alone or both the DC -RDS and CM 
activities. However, only sites that are granted a waiver of parental consent for the DC -RDS 
activities will be allowed to screen minors (16 and 17 year olds).   
Participants will document their provision  of informed consent by [CONTACT_420002]. (Further details regarding DAIDS requirements for documenting the informed consent 
process are provided in the DAIDS Standard Operating Procedure for Source Documentation.)  
All p articipants will be offered  a copy of their informed consent forms.  
8.[ADDRESS_529687] -protected access systems. Forms, l ists, logbooks, appointment books, and 
any other listings that link participant identification ( ID) numbers to other identifying information 
will be stored in a separate, locked file in an area with limited access.  
Participant’s study information will not be released without the written permission of the 
participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_420003]; representatives of 
the HPTN Leadership and Operations Center ( LOC ), SDMC, or HPTN LC ; Office for Human 
Research Protections ( OHR P) or other government and regulatory authorities; or site IRBs.

Page 28 of 88 9.0 LABORATORY SPECIMENS  AND BIOHARDS  CONTAINMENT  
Laboratory procedures are described below and in Appendix I.  
9.1 Local Laboratory Specimens  
Specimens will be collected for testing at the local laboratory. Laboratory evaluations/procedures 
will include:  
• HIV testing (see SSP Manual)  
• Syphilis  testing  
• HCV testing (see SSP Manual)  
• CD4 cell count testing  
• HIV viral load testing  
• Plasma storage  
Local laboratories and clinics where testing is performed must be certified under the Continuous 
Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA -certified) or must b e in possession of a CLIA 
Waiver. Additional local and State guidelines must also be followed.  
Each study site will adhere to standards of good clinical laboratory practice, and local standard 
operating procedures for specimen management including proper c ollection, processing, labeling, 
transport, and storage of specimens to the local laboratories. Specimen storage at the local 
laboratory will be documented using the HPTN Laboratory Data Management System (LDMS) as 
described in the SSP Manual.  
9.2 LC Speci mens  
Specimens will be collected for testing at the HPTN LC. Laboratory evaluations and procedures 
will include:  
• HIV quality assurance ( QA) testing  
• Other testing*  
*Stored plasma will be used for QA testing and other assessments at the HPTN LC . This may 
include cross -sectional incidence testing (to identify participants who are recently infected at 
Enrollment ). Stored samples will also be used for  phylogenetic analysis. Other assessments that 
may be performed include ARV drug testing; HIV resis tance testing; characterization of HIV and 
HCV and the host response to viral infection. Samples collected in the study may also be used to 
evaluate assays related to HIV and HCV infection. In some cases, testing will be performed at a 
commercial laborator y or another  laboratory designated by [CONTACT_420005]. These assessments will 
be performed retrospectively; results will not be returned to study sites or participants (with the 
possible exception of HIV diagnostic testing, if results obtained at the HPTN LC d iffer from site 
results).  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.[ADDRESS_529688] periodic visits to each site to assess the implementation of on -site 
laboratory quality control (QC) procedures, including proper maintenance of labor atory testing 
equipment and use of appropriate reagents. HPTN LC staff will follow up directly with site staff 
to resolve any QC or QA problems identified through proficiency testing and/or on -site 
assessments.    
9.4 QC for HIV Diagnostic Testing  
The HPTN  LC will perform HIV diagnostic testing for QC. Algorithms for HIV diagnostic 
testing are provided in the SSP Manual.  
9.5 Phylogenetic Analysis  
Phylogenetic methods will be used to explore the relationship between viruses from study 
participants . HIV sequencing will be performed at the HPTN LC or another laboratory designated 
by [CONTACT_420005]. HIV sequencing will be performed by [CONTACT_420006] (population) sequencing; next 
generation/deep sequencing may also be performed. The HPTN LC will determine the metho ds 
used for phylogenetic analysis (e.g., the HIV genomic regions analyzed, use of local and other 
control sequences, methodology used for data analysis).  
9.[ADDRESS_529689] three years 
after the end of the study (completion of the last study visit). In addition, study participants will 
be asked to provide written informed consent for their plasma specimens to be stored after the e nd 
of the study for possible future testing related to HIV and HCV infection , evaluation of laboratory 
assays relevant to the study objectives , and other assessments . The specimens of participants who 
do not consent to long -term storage and additional test ing will be destroyed after all protocol -
related testing has been completed; sample destruction must be coordinated with the HPTN LC 
and HPTN SDMC.

and to inform policy decisions .77 They are also increasingly and innovatively being used at 
different stages of the clinical trial process: to inform product development, to inform the design 
of optimal combinatio n prev ention, to  inform the design and conduct of large community -based 
clinical trials, and to interpret and help generalize results  to the wider population .[ADDRESS_529693] been used to estimate the impac t of role segregation 
(taking only the insertive or receptive role in anal intercourse) ,79-81 and serosorting (having anal 
sex only w ith MSM of the same HIV status) ,82, [ADDRESS_529694] main objective of the study is to measure the success of 
the DC -RDS strategy in finding MSM who are not virally suppressed (primary objective), while 
also capturing useful information about the risk profile (behavioral, socio -demographic and 
clinical) of the population reached and retained at different stages of the treatment cascade 
(secondary objective). The second primary objective of the study is to measure the impact of the 
CM intervention upon the proportion of MSM achieving viral suppress ion after 2 4 months 
(primary objective), and the time to viral suppression (secondary objective), as well as  collecting 
data on intermediate steps including the proportion linked to care and remaining engaged in care 
(secondary objective).  
Given the focus on treatment outcomes and the endpoint of viral suppression , and the fact that the 
CM intervention can influence multiple outcomes on the causal HIV prevention pathway  among 
HIV-infected MSM  (e.g. increased initiation and retention in treat ment, changes in sexual 
behavior), it is difficult to understand the prevention potential of the individual -level CM 
intervention on population -level HIV incidence based on the trial results alone. Mathematical 
models are needed to translate the results of  the CM intervention components implemented in this 
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.[ADDRESS_529695].  
Models can also be used to estimate the level of treatment -as-prevention efforts required to 
reduce HIV incidence at the population  level by a substantial amount as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2595], and 
to assess whether the results of this trial in terms of CM intervention uptake, retention, adherence, 
and the risk profile of the population reached and responding favorably to the CM intervention 
warrant roll -out of the CM intervention to the wider MSM population.  
10.3 Model Population and Setting  
The modelled population will be all sexually active MSM (both HIV -infected and 
HIV-uninfected) in each of the four different sites included in the trial.  
10.4 Main Model Outcomes  
The main model outcomes include the following:  
• Predicted population -level reduction in incidence and prevalence achieved by [CONTACT_420008], and by [CONTACT_420009] (HIV testing, ART 
uptake, retent ion in care and viral suppression) over 2, 5 and 10 years at each site.  
• Predicted preventable fraction (PF): The fraction of new HIV infections averted by a given 
CM intervention package, or its independent component s, over a fixed time period  
• Estimated level of viral suppression required to reduce HIV incidence at each site by 10%, 
20%, 30%, and 50% over 2, 5 and 10 years.  
• Estimates of whether or not the CM intervention would be likely to result in HIV elimination 
(HIV incidence less than one new HIV inf ection per 1000 people per year91) at each site, and 
the time taken to reach this elimination threshold, both with achieved levels of viral 
suppression, and for the differ ent levels of viral suppression required to meet incidence 
reduction targets.  
• Population attributable fraction ( PAF): The contribution of different risk groups or risk 
factors to HIV transmission over different time periods.  
10.[ADDRESS_529696] of the CM intervention at the population level.  
  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 32 of 88 For each setting, the m odeling study will include a number of stages:  
• Model development and coding  
• Model parameterization  
• Model calibration and fitting to HIV prevalence and incidence data from various site specific 
sources  
• Model analysis: estimation of CM intervention impact,  including uncertainty and sensitivity 
analysis  
More details about the different stages are given in the following sections.  
10.5.1 Model Development and Coding  
The proposed model is a dynamic, deterministic compartmental model which describes HIV 
transmission via anal sex between and among different risk groups of MSM, as well as rates of 
HIV progression and levels of testing and treatment over time. Within the model, the MSM 
population will be divided into different categories stratified by [CONTACT_654], r ace, sexual risk activity (e.g. 
rate of partner acquisition, frequency of sex acts)92, 93  and sexual role behavior (exclusively 
insertive, exclusively receptive, or versatile in anal sex) (Figure 3).80, 94  
Figure 3: Behavioral Groups and Sexual Mixing in the Model.  
 

 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 33 of 88 MSM are divided into different groups relating to sexual role behavior (exclusively insertive , 
exclusively receptive, or versatile in anal sex), age, race and sexual risk activity.  MSM in each of 
these groups may be uninfected with HIV (gray), infected and not virally suppressed (red; highly 
infectious), or infected, treated and virally suppresse d (green; reduced infectiousness). Sexual 
mixing between these groups will be informed by [CONTACT_420010], race, sexual 
risk and sexual role. As ART coverage increases (i.e. the proportion of sexual partners on ART 
increases), HIV viral load  will decrease (viral suppression increases) and so HIV incidence will 
decrease.  
In the model, HIV infection and progression will be modelled as a number of discrete stages 
through which MSM move – susceptible (uninfected), acute HIV infection (stage 1), c hronic HIV 
infection, divided into three stages (stages 2 -4), and AIDS (stage 5; Figure 4).[ADDRESS_529697] reduced infectivity (Figures 3 and 4). HIV -
infected MSM may move between different categories reflecting their testing and treatment 
status, including  those unaware of their HIV positive status, those tested, linked into pre -ART 
care, those on ART and partially or fully virally suppressed and those who are lost to follow -up, 
have discontinued ART and those living with HIV who have never been tested. Thi s last category 
contains individuals who may also initiate ART when they present with symptoms (F igure 4).  
Figure 4: Infection and Treatment S tates.  
 
 

 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 34 of 88 MSM in the model are divided into separate categories by [CONTACT_420011]. Infected 
MSM are divided by [CONTACT_420012], with the chronic phase subdivided into several stages 
(reflecting CD4 levels when untreated) to allow more accurate timing of AIDS, appearance of 
symptoms and ART initiation and modelling historical increases in treatment wh ich was based on 
CD4 levels. MSM on ART have greatly reduced infectivity when they are virally suppressed. The 
level of infectiousness is indicated in pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]/red/green. MSM start ART either due to presenting 
symptoms or following testing . 
The force of HIV in fection (or per capi[INVESTIGATOR_419970]) for susceptible MSM will be 
estimated (following calibration, details below) based upon the frequency and type of sex acts 
(insertive/receptive) they have, as well as condom use with different types of partner (ma in, 
casual and commercial), their circumcision status, PrEP and PEP use, who their sexual partners 
are likely to be (based upon mixing preferences related to age, race, sexual risk activity and 
serostatus  and data on the proportion of sexual partners resid ent inside and outside of the study 
community ), and levels of HIV prevalence and ART us e among those partners (F igure 5). To 
capture the impact of other STIs upon HIV transmission risk, syphilis prevalence measured at 
baseline will be used together with pu blished estimates of the increased risk of HIV transmission 
in the presence of syphilis to estimate associated increases in HIV transmission  in each setting, 
assuming stable syphilis prevalence. The final model structure will depend upon the site -specific 
data available (from the trial and other complementary sources) to determine parameters and also 
upon important identified sources of heterogeneity.

HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 35 of 88 This figure summarizes the different factors which contribute to the forc e of infection (per capi[INVESTIGATOR_419971]), including characteristics of the susceptible MSM and of their sexual partners.  
The model will incorporate the effects over time of past and existing interventions (e.g., increases 
in condom and ART use), and futu re interventions (the CM intervention and standard of care, 
including associated levels of linkage to care, ART initiation and adherence and retention in 
care), upon HIV susceptibility, transmissibility and rate of disease progression. Changes in levels 
of HIV testing will also be represented, as will documented changes in sexual behavior (including 
number and type of partners and sexual mixing patterns).  
The model will consist of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations and will be coded 
with a fl exible programming language (e.g. C++).  
10.5.2 Model Parameterization  
The data required to inform model parameters and calibrate the model cover five main domains: 
demography, sexual behavior, natural history of HIV, intervention, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_419972]. This information should ideally be obtained from representative samples of the population. 
We will use data from the trial (which may need to be standardized to reflect the wider MSM 
population , and to account for the recruitment process ), and we wil l also comprehensively review 
and make use of other relevant sources of data such as HIV surveillance data, the published 
literature, systematic reviews and official reports. The trial will provide data to inform the 
modelling of future intervention s, incl uding data on the demography, sexual behavior, prior HIV 
testing, HIV prevalence , viral status,  and ART use of those recruited through DC -RDS . The trial 
will also provide estimates of the proportion of people linking to and retained in care, initiating 
ART  and achieving viral suppression, with and without the CM intervention package . In addition, 
the trial will provide  data on the demographic and risk profiles of those retained at each stage of 
the HIV care cascade. Complementary data from other sources wil l be needed to inform 
modelling of past behavior and interventions and to characterize the wider MSM population at 
each site (including demographic, sexual behavior and HIV testing data). Other data will also be 
required to model the progression of HIV and  effectiveness of different interventions, and to 
capture historical changes in behavior and ART c overage. Likely sources of data to inform the 
CM intervention and standard of care scenarios  are summarized in Table 4; the final data sources 
used may vary d epending upon the exact sites used for the trial.

prevalence and inciden ce data over time (which is representative of the sites modelled) within a 
Bayesian framework where a priori  information on the key parameters from available data 
sources is updated through a comparison of the model simulations and epi[INVESTIGATOR_419972].106 The parameter  ranges constructed in the model parameterization stage  will be 
exhaustively sampled and e xplored at the calibration stage , using state of the art fitting methods 
previously used107-109 in order to identify multiple parameter sets that  agree with the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_419974] (HIV prevalence and incidence) , producing a set of model predictions 
which reflect HIV patterns by [CONTACT_420016]. This set of simulations will form our baseline scenario and 
baseline parameter sets. As per standard procedure in modelling studies ,94, 95, 107, 108, [ADDRESS_529700] the following analyses: (1) assess the 
population level impact of the overall study strategy on HIV incidence and prevalence, and the  
preventable fraction of HIV infecti ons averted; (2) assess the population level impact of the 
individual components of the CM intervention (including HIV testing, ART uptake, retention in 
care, viral suppression)  on HIV incidence and prevalence  and the preventable fraction of HIV 
infection s averted by [CONTACT_420017]; (3) estimate the level of viral suppression 
required to reduce HIV incidence at each site by 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% over 2, 5 and 10 
years ; (4) estimate the likelihood of and time taken to reach HIV elimination; (5 ) estimate the 
PAF for different risk groups , the stage in the cascade of care  and the risk factor s over different 
time periods; (6) uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall CM Intervention Impact  
The model will be run for each site under two alternative scenarios, standard of care (baseline) 
and CM intervention, with levels of testing, linkage, ART initiation and retention, and viral 
suppression going into the future informed by [CONTACT_420018] (table 
1). Predicted overall CM intervention impact will be determined by [CONTACT_420019], HIV incidence rate and HIV prevalence in the CM intervention and 
baseline scenarios over 2, [ADDRESS_529701] of the total CM intervention package on population -
level HIV incidence and prevalence, and the preventable fraction PF(dt) of HIV infections. In 
these ana lyses we will take into account differences in CM intervention coverage and uptake by 
[INVESTIGATOR_56579].  Each modelling  outcome will be presented as the mean, median and uncertainty rang e 
(95% percentile s of the model predictions based on the multiple posterior p arameter sets).  
  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 39 of 88 [IP_ADDRESS]  Impact of Individual CM Intervention Components  
We will then use the models to estimate the impact of the observed independent CM intervention 
components, by [CONTACT_420020] (increased rates of HIV testing, increased linkage, ART uptake, retention in 
treatment and viral suppression) are included, and comparing these with the baseline model in the 
same way as for the full CM intervention model, above, to  estimate the reduction in incidence and 
prevalence and the PF associated with each CM intervention component and combination of 
components.  Each modelling  outcome will be presented as the mean, median and uncertainty 
range (95 % percentile s of the model pr edictions based on the multiple posterior parameter sets).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Required Viral Suppression to Achieve Incidence Reduction Targets  
We will also use the models to estimate the level of viral suppression and associated CM 
intervention efforts that need t o be achieved in order to reduce HIV incidence in the MSM 
community by 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% over 2, 5 and 10 years .  
[IP_ADDRESS] HIV Elimination  
We will estimate whether HIV is predicted to be eliminated if the CM intervention were carried 
on into the futur e for each site, both with achieved levels of viral suppression, and for the 
different levels of viral suppression required to meet the incidence reduction targets  (10%, 20%, 
30%, and 50% reduction over 2, 5 and 10 years ). Elimination is defined as HIV incidence going 
below one new HIV infection per 1000 people per year .91 Where elimination is predicted, we will 
estimate the predicted tim e taken to reach the elimination threshold.   
Each study outcome will be presented as the mean, median and uncertainty rang e (95 % 
percentile s of the model predictions based on the multiple posterior parameter sets).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Population Attributable Fractio n (PAF)  
We will d etermine the main drivers of HIV acquisition and transmission  in the MSM populations 
studied by [CONTACT_420021] .111, 112 The PA F(dt) will be 
derived by [CONTACT_420022]: 1) 
assuming that the given risk factor increases risk of HIV acquisition or transmission or the 
relevant risk behavior; 2) assuming no increase in risk associated with the factor under study . The 
key risk groups for whom we will calculate PAFs  will be: sexual role  groups  (insertive or 
receptive, versatile), untested MSM , and HIV-infected MSM  who not virally suppressed .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses  
We will conduct an uncertainty analysis using the multiple calibrated simulations to assess the 
influence of key epi[INVESTIGATOR_419975]/parameters (in CM intervention and 
SOC control  arms) on impact predictions (using a technique such as partial rank correlation), and 
determine under which conditions a  CM intervention will have the largest impact (using 
techniques such as regression trees analysis).   
We will conduct a sens itivity analysis to determine the influence on the impact estimates 
(incidence and prevalence reduction and PF) of key parameters such as the evolution of the SOC 
over time, and determine a threshold of high sensitivity where impact is considerably reduced .

Page 40 of 88 11.0 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES  
11.1 Protocol Registration  
Initial Registration of the protocol by [CONTACT_420023] (PRO) is required 
prior to implementation of this protocol. As part of this process, each site must have the protocol 
and protocol informed consent form(s) approved, as appropriate, by [CONTACT_9918]/ethics 
committee (EC) and any other a pplicable regulatory entity . Upon receiving final approval, sites 
will submit all required protocol registration documents to the DAIDS PRO  at the Regulatory 
Support Center (RSC). The DAIDS PRO will review the submitted protocol registration packet to 
ensure that all of the required documents have been received. In the case of Initial Registration, 
site-specific informed consent forms (ICFs) will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_68410]. 
Sites will receive an Initial Registration Notification from the DAIDS PRO that indicates 
successful completion of the protocol registration process. A copy of the Initial Registration 
Notification should be retained in the site's regulatory files.  
Following Initial Registration, any full protocol amendments require submission of a protocol 
registration packet to the DAIDS PRO as described above; however, the DAIDS PRO will not  
review and approve site -specific  ICFs. Sites will receive a Registration Notification when the 
DAIDS PRO receives a complete registration packet.  
For additional information on the protocol registration process and specific documents required 
for initial and amendment registrations, refe r to the current version of the DAIDS Protocol 
Registration Manual, which can be found at http://rsc.tech -res.com/protocolregistration/.  
11.2 Study Activation  
Pending successful protocol registration and submission of all required documents, the HPTN 
LOC s taff will “activate” a site. Study implementation may not be initiated until a study 
activation notice is provided to the site by [CONTACT_132794]. In addition, if study “activation” is 
determined to be necessary for any subsequent amendments, study implementa tion may not be 
initiated until a study activation notice is provided to the site by [CONTACT_132794].  
11.3 Study Coordination  
Study implementation will be directed by [CONTACT_420024] M anual. The SSP 
Manual will outline procedures for conducting study visits; data and forms processing; social 
harm assessment, management and reporting; and other study operations.  
Study CRFs  and other study instruments will be developed by [CONTACT_420025]. Data will be transferred to the H PTN SDMC for data entry, cleaning, reporting and 
analysis. Quality control reports and queries will be generated and distributed to the study sites on 
a routine schedule for verification and resolution.  
Close coordination between protocol team members will  be necessary to track study progress, 
respond to queries about proper study implementation, and address other issues in a timely 
manner. Rates of accrual, adherence, follow -up, and social harm incidence will be monitored 
closely by [CONTACT_420026] ( SMC ). The Protocol 
Chair, DAIDS Medical Officer, Protocol Biostatistician, SDMC Project Manager, and HPTN 
LOC representatives will address issues related to study eligibility and social harm management

Page 41 of 88 and reporting as nee ded to assure consistent case management, documentation, and information -
sharing across sites.  
11.4 Study Monitoring  
On-site study monitoring will be performed in accordance with DAIDS policies. Study monitors 
will visit the site to:  
• Verify compliance with  human subjects and other research regulations and guidelines;  
• Assess adherence to the study protocol, study -specific procedures manual, and local 
counseling practices; and  
• Confirm the quality and accuracy of information collected at the study site and en tered into 
the study database.  
Site investigators will allow study monitors to inspect study facilities and documentation (e.g., 
informed consent forms, clinic and laboratory records, other sou rce documents, CRFs ), as well as 
observe the performance of stu dy procedures. Investigators also will allow inspection of all study -
related documentation by [CONTACT_132799], HPTN SDMC, HPTN 
LC, NIAID, site IRBs/ECs, and US regulatory authorities (OHRP). A site visit log will be 
maintained at  each study site to document all visits.  
11.[ADDRESS_529702] be submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_56335](s) and the DAIDS 
RSC prior to implementing the amendment.  
11.6 Investigator’s Records  
All site Investigators of Record (IoR) will be responsible for maintaining, and storing in a secure 
manner, complete, accurate, and current study records throughout the study. Under the US 
Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) regulations, the IoR is required to retain all 
study records relating to research for at least three [3] years after complet ion of the research, or 
longer if needed to comply with local regulations.  Completion of a clinical research study occurs 
when the following activities have been completed:  
• All research -related interventions or interactions with human subjects;  
• All proto col-required data collection of identifiable private information described in the 
IRB/EC -approved research plan;  
• All analysis of identifiable private information described in the IRB/EC -approved research 
plan;  
• Primary analysis of either identifiable priv ate or de -identified information.  
Study records include administrative documentation — including protocol registration documents 
and all reports and correspondence relating to the study — as well as documentation related to

INTRODUCTION: You are being asked to take part in a research study. This study is looking at 
the best way to find men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women, who may be at 
risk for getting HIV (Hum an Immunodeficiency Virus) . To find out if you are eligible for this 
study, a rapid HIV test will be done to test for HIV. [ Sites may add reference to the inclusion of 
transgender women to the extent that they want, may change third person pronouns (eg., he to 
they) as they see fit for their site or may choose to have a separate consent for transgender 
women. ] 
If your rapid test is positive for HIV, repeat testing is needed to confirm (prove) this result. If 
your second sample is proved to be positive for HIV, it means that you have HIV. This means 
that you can pass the virus to others by [CONTACT_420029], by [CONTACT_420030], and by [CONTACT_420031]. A negative rapid test means that you do not have HIV but should be tested again if 
you have been expo sed within the last 3 -6 months.  
YOUR PARTICIPATION IS VOLUNTARY: You may refuse to be screened. You may also 
refuse the HIV test or to give your contact [CONTACT_3031]. You may withdraw your consent for

post-test counseling  [sites to revise per  their requirements ]. We will also ask for your contact 
[CONTACT_35666] n so that we can reach you when your test results are complete. [Sites to add  expected 
duration].  When your results are ready, you will be scheduled for an appointment. This 
appointment will be to discuss your results and receive further testing, if you ch oose.  
If you already know that you are HIV positive, you don’t need to take a rapid HIV test. If you 
would like, you may still give your contact [CONTACT_420032]. This 
appointment will do further screening to see if you are el igible for this study.   
RISKS AND/OR DISCOMFORTS : You may be nervous while you are waiting for your HIV 
test result. If the test  show s that you have HIV, you may worry about your health and future. You

INTRODUCTION  
You are being asked to take part in a research study. This study is designed to find the best way to 
find men who have sex with men (MSM) and offer them HIV testing . Joining this stu dy is 
voluntary. You may refuse to join, or you may withdraw your consent to be in the study, for any 
reason. This study is for MSM and transgender women, who may be at risk for getting Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. HIV is the virus that causes Acquired Immuno deficiency 
Syndrome, or AIDS. [ Sites may add reference to the inclusion of transgender women to the extent 
that they want, may change third person pronouns (eg., he to they ) as they see fit for their site or 
may choose to have a separate consen t for transgender women. ] 
Before you decide whether to join the study, we would like to explain the purpose of the 
screening, the risks and benefits, and what is expected of you.  
YOUR PARTICIPATION IS VOLUNTARY  
This consent form gives information about th e screening. Once you understand the screening, and 
if you agree to take part, you will be asked to sign your name [CONTACT_420054]. 
You will be offered a copy of this form to keep.  
Before you learn about screening, it is important that you know the following:  
• Your participation is voluntary. You do not have to take part in any of the screening tests, 
questionnaires or procedures.  
• You may decide not to take part in screening, or you may decide to leave the screening at any 
time.  
• If you decide  not to take part in the screening, you can still join another study at a later time if 
there is one available and you qualify.  
• If you decide not to take part in the screening, or decide to stop participating at any time, 
there will be no penalty or loss o f the normal benefits provided to you at our clinic.  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 58 of 88 PURPOSE OF THE SCREENING  
The purpose of the screening is to find MSM using a method called “respondent driven sampling” 
or “RDS.” In RDS, we ask MSM to invite other MSM they know to come to our clinic f or 
screening. We will also invite MSM to take part in this study that we find in other ways.  
We plan to screen about 2700 people from four US cities (about 675 in each participating city) in 
two years. During screening, we will test MSM for HIV, hepatitis  C virus and syphilis. We will 
also ask each MSM to complete a questionnaire. If we find MSM who are HIV -infected, we may 
invite them to take part in another study. This other study is testing whether case manager support 
can help MSM receive regular HIV c are and regularly take their HIV medication.  
Information from the screening procedures will be used to prevent the spread of HIV in the MSM 
community.   
SCREENING PROCEDURES  
If you agree to participate, you will be asked to take part in up to three screening visits.   
Screening will happen after you read, discuss, understand, and sign this form. We will help you 
understand the form and answer your questions before you sign thi s form. The procedures done 
during Screening will take about [ sites to fill in the amount of time] hours each time.  
During screening:  
• We will confirm where you live and how to contact [CONTACT_10825].  
• We will ask you to answer a questionnaire.  This questionnaire wil l ask you about yourself 
(like your age and race) and your sexual behavior and partners. It will also ask you about 
your use of HIV drugs, HIV testing history and health care use. Finally, it will ask you about 
your involvement in the lesbian, gay, bisexua l and transgender (LGBT) community and 
stigma you may have faced because you are an MSM.  
• We will ask you if you have had any problems because y ou are a part of this screening.  
• We will talk to you about HIV and other infections that can be spread sexually . We will give 
you information to help you protect yourself from getting them or passing them on to others.  
• We may give you a rapid HIV test. The rapid test will use a d rop of blood from your finger or 
arm or  a swab from the inside of your mouth.  If your rap id test is positive for HIV, repeat 
testing is needed to confirm (prove) this result. If your second sample is proved to be positive 
for HIV, it means that you have HIV. A negative rapid test means that you do not have HIV 
but should be tested again if you  have been exposed within the last 3 -6 months.  
• We will collect a small amount of blood about 33 mL = about 6 teaspoons) to test for 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) and syphilis.  
• If you are HIV -infected, a small amount of blood (about 14 mL = about 3 teaspoons) wi ll be 
collected to make sure you have HIV . This blood will also be used to measure your CD4 cell 
count and viral load. These tests tell us how much HIV is in your blood (viral load) and how 
much the virus has affected your ability to fight the virus (CD4).   
• We may give you coupons and ask you to invite MSM you know to come to the clinic for 
screening.  
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 59 of 88 • We will give you the results of your HIV, hepatitis C virus and syphilis tests.  If you have any 
of these infections, you will be referred for treatment [ sites to add specifics about how this 
will take place at their site ]. 
• If we can’t tell if you are infected or not after your HIV tests, you will be referred for further 
testing and care.  
• If you were asked to invite people you know to come for HIV testing, we  will ask you 
questions about who you invited.  
If you are HIV -uninfected:  If your HIV test results show that you aren’t infected, we will 
give you information about how to prevent getting HIV.  
If you are HIV -infected: If your HIV test results show that you  are infected, we will check 
your viral load test to see if you are eligible for another study. If so, we may ask you if you 
are interested in being in the study. The study is testing if case manager support can help 
those who are HIV -infected. If you do n ot want to take part in this study, we will tell you 
where you can go to receive HIV care.  
RISKS AND/OR DISCOMFORTS  
Blood Draws  
Taking blood samples may cause some pain, bruise your arm, or make you feel lightheaded.  In 
rare cases, you may faint. There i s also a small chance of infection when blood is drawn.  
HIV Testing and Potential Social Harm  
You may be nervous while you are waiting for your HIV test result. If the tests show that you 
have HIV, you may worry about your health and future. You will receive counseling before and 
after the test to help address your concerns. We will make every effort to protect your 
confidentiality during the study. However, it is possible that others may learn that you are part of 
this screening. They may thi nk that you are infected with HIV or are at high risk for infection 
with HIV. Because of this you could have trouble finding or keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a job. You could also have 
problems with your family, friends and community.   
Sensitive Questions  
The questions we will  ask you about your sexual behavior and partners or about stigma you may 
have faced may make you feel uneasy. However, you do not have to answer any question that you 
do not want to. You can also stop answering the questions at any time.  
BENEFITS  
We will test you for HIV, hepatitis C virus and syphilis. If you have any of these infections, we 
will help you receive care and treatment. We will also tell you how to avoid passing them on to 
your sexual partners. The counseling you get during this study may hel p you avoid HIV and other 
infections that can be spread sexually.  
You may not receive any other direct benefit from being in this study. You or others in your 
community may benefit from these screening activities in the future. The information found 
during  screening may help prevent HIV and other infections in the MSM community.

INTRODUCTION  
You are being asked to take part in a research study. This study is testing if support from a case 
manager can help HIV -infected people receive regular HIV care and regularly take their HIV 
medication . Joining this study is voluntary. You may refuse to join, or you may withdraw your 
consent to be in the study, for any reason.  This research study is for men who have sex with  men 
(MSM) and transgender women, who have Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. HIV is the 
virus that causes Acquired Immuno deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. [ Sites may add reference to 
the inclusion of transgender women to the extent that they want, may chan ge third person 
pronouns (eg., he to they ) as they see fit for their site or may choose to have a separate consent 
for transgender women. ] 
Before you decide whether to join the study, we would like to explain the purpose of the study, 
the risks and benefit s, and what is expected of you.

Page 64 of 88 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
The purpose of this study is to find out if support from a case manager can help HIV -infected 
people receive regular HIV care and regularly take their HIV medication.  
The purpose of this study is also to help researchers understand how HIV spreads in the 
community. We will look at the different types of virus found in the blood samples of different 
people in the community wh o are living with HIV. In science , we call this phylogenetics.   
STUDY GROUPS  
We plan to enroll 356 HIV -infected men and follow them for two years. Half of the participants 
will receive the intervention (support from a case manager [CM]) and the other half will not. At 
the end of the study, the two groups will be compared to see if the CM support helped 
participants stay in HIV care and take their HIV drugs regularly.  
You will be “randomized” to either the group who will get case manager support or the grou p 
who will get the same care that patients normally get to stay in HIV care and take their HIV drugs 
regularly.  “Randomization” means that you are put into a group by [CONTACT_3364]. It is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
coin. You have will an equal chance of being in either gro up. Both groups are important to the 
study.  
CM Intervention Group  
If you are in the CM intervention group , you will receive support from a case manager who will 
help you link to and stay in HIV care. When you are ready, the case manager will also help you 
start HIV medication and take it properly. The help from the case manager will be specific to 
your needs.  
Standard -of-Care (SOC) Control Group  
If you are in the SOC control group , you will get the same care that patients normally get to stay 
in HIV care a nd take their HIV drugs properly.   
Co-Enrollment in Other Studies  
While you are in this study, you may not take part in other studies that help you link to HIV care 
or take your HIV medication properly.   
STUDY PROCEDURES  
If you join the study, you will b e asked to take part in 7 study visits over two years. If you are in 
the case manager group, you will also be contact[CONTACT_420037].  
Enrollment Visit  
Your enrollment visit will happen after you read, understand, and sign this form. We will hel p 
you understand the form and answer your questions before you sign this form. The procedures 
done at the Enrollment Visit will take about [ sites to fill in the amount of time ] hours.  
During this visit:  
• We will confirm where you live and how to contact [CONTACT_10825]. 
 
HPTN 078, Final  Version 2.0 July 3 , 2017  
Page 65 of 88 • We will give you the results of your HIV, hepatitis C virus and syphilis tests if you did not 
receive them at screening. If you have any of these infections, you will be referred for 
treatment [ sites to add specifics about how this will take place at their site ]. 
• We will ask you to give us permission to review your medical records.  
• We will ask you to answer a questionnaire.  This questionnaire will ask you about your use of 
recreational drugs and alcohol. It will also ask about your mental health.  
• We will invite you to bring your sexual partner(s) for HIV testing. [Note: Partner testing is 
conducted outside of the study and results are not recorded.]  
• If you are in the case manager group, the study case manager (CM) will talk to you about 
HIV. They w ill give you information to help you decide where you would like to go for HIV 
care and when to start HIV drugs. You will choose how much support you need from the case 
manager. You can talk with the case -manager by [CONTACT_3649], email, phone, or in -person. The se ssion 
with the case manager will be audio -recorded.  
• We will collect a small amount of blood (about 34 mL = about 7 teaspoons) which will be 
stored. This blood will be used to check the results of tests performed at the study site and 
other study testing. T his testing will give us information about the HIV virus and how the 
virus spreads in the community. The blood may also be used to test for the presence of HIV 
drugs and to learn more about how the body responds to HIV infection. If you have hepatitis 
C, the blood may also be used for testing to learn more about the hepatitis C virus and how it 
spreads in the community. Results from testing using stored samples will not be returned to 
you or the study site.  
Monthly Contact  
[CONTACT_420038], you will be contact[CONTACT_420039]. We will ask if you are having any problems with your health or your 
HIV medication. We will ask you if you have had any problems because you are a part of this 
study. You may choose to have us call, email or text you every month. You can also ask to meet 
with the case manager monthly, or more often, if you want more support.   
Follow -up Visits  
You will be asked to return to the clinic for a total of 5 Follow -up Visits. The  procedures done at 
the Follow -up Visits will take about [ sites to fill in the amount of time ] hours.  
During this visit:  
• We will confirm where you live and how to contact [CONTACT_10825].  
• We will ask you if you have had any problems because you are a part of this stud y. 
• We will invite you to bring your sexual partner(s) for HIV testing.  
• We will collect a small amount of blood (about 34 mL = about 7 teaspoons) to do CD4 cell 
count and viral load testing. Some of the blood will be stored for additional testing. These 
tests will give us information about the HIV virus and how the virus spreads in the 
community. The blood may also be used to test for the presence of HIV drugs and to learn 
more about how the body responds to HIV infection. If you have hepatitis C, the blood may 
also be used for testing to learn more about the hepatitis C virus and how it spreads in the

Name [CONTACT_155866]: Etrasimod (APD334)  
Protocol number: APD334 -301 
Protocol title: A Phase  3, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, 52 -Week Study to 
Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Etrasimod in Subjects with Moderately to Severe ly Active 
Ulcerative Colitis  
Phase: 3 
Regions: North America, South America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa  
Objectives:  
Primary : 
The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of etrasimod on clinical remission in subjects 
with moderately to  severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) after 12 and 52  weeks of treatment.  
Secondary : 
The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of etrasimod on clinical response, 
symptomatic response and remission, endoscopic changes, corticosteroid -free remissi on, and 
mucosal healing in subjects with moderately to severely active UC at timepoints up to 
52 weeks of treatment.  
Safety : 
The safety objective is to assess the long -term safety of etrasimod after daily doses of 2  mg for 
up to 52  weeks in subjects with m oderately to severely active UC.  
Other : 
Other objectives include evaluation of etrasimod pharmacokinetics (PK) and the effect of 
etrasimod on health -related subject -reported outcomes and biomarkers.  
Study design:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of etrasimod [ADDRESS_180131] population will include (approximately 50% of subjects in each of the 
following categories):  
1. Subjects who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or  intolerance to 
conventional therapy and are  näive to biologic or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy  
2. Subjects who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to a 
biologic or JAK inhibitor ( subjects in this category may have received prior conventional 
therapy).  
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301 
Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.[ADDRESS_180132]  eligibility will be determined during a 4 -Week (28 -Day) Screening Period. Entry 
criteria will be based on confirmation of moderately to severely active UC, defined by a 
modified Mayo score (MMS) of 4  to 9, which includes an endoscopic score (ES)  ≥ 2 and r ectal 
bleeding (RB) score ≥  1. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized (2:1  ratio) to receive either etrasimod (2  mg once daily) 
or matching placebo (once daily) in a double -blind fashion for up to 52  weeks (12 -Week 
Treatment Period + 40 -Week Treatment Period ). Randomization will be stratified by (a)  naïve 
to biologic or JAK inhibitor  therapy  at study entry (yes  or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use 
(yes or no), and (c)  baseline disease activity (MMS: 4  to 6 or 7  to 9). 
End of 12 -Week Double -Blind Treatment Period  
At the end of the 12 -Week Treatment Period, subjects will undergo the Week  12 efficacy and 
safety assessments and procedures. Subjects whose disease is stable or improving compared 
with baseline (Week 0/Day 1) will continue  with their double -blind treatment and move into 
the [ADDRESS_180133] complete Week  12 to be eligible for the OLE. Subjects who do not meet disease 
worsening criteria, including those demonstrating clinical response/remission at Week  12 will 
continue into th e 40-Week Treatment Period and continue their double -blind treatment. 
Disease worsening will continue to be monitored by [CONTACT_155794] 40 -Week 
Treatment Period (ie, from Weeks  13 to 52). Subjects who either experience disease 
worsening in the [ADDRESS_180134] the option to enroll into the OLE study if they meet all eligibility criteria.  
Subjects may be eligible to enroll in the OLE provided their ES is ≥  2 and they meet one of the 
following entry criteria:  
• RB subscore ≥  [ADDRESS_180135] 7  days and no more than 14  days apart  
• RB + SF subscore s ≥ [ADDRESS_180136] 7  days and no more than 14  days apart  
• RB subscore ≥  2 or RB + SF subscores ≥  4 (in any order) at [ADDRESS_180137] treatment administration  
End of 40 -Week Double -Blind Treatment Period (Week  52) 
At the end of the 40 -Week Treatment Period (ie, Week  52) and following completion of all 
study procedures, subjects will have the option to enter into the OLE study (APD334 -303) 
provided  they meet all eligibility criteria.  
Subjects who do not participate in the OLE study will have [ADDRESS_180138] treatment administration   
Number of subjects (planned):  
Approximately 420 subjects are planned to be enrolled into this study.

Statistica l methods:  
Sample size  
Based on a 2-group  Fisher’s exact test, a 1-sided  significance level of 0.025, and a 2:1 
randomization ratio, 420 total subjects ( 280 etrasimod, 140 placebo) are required to achieve 
93.4% power to detect a difference of 13.5% in the primary endpoint of clinical remission at 
Week  52 between the etrasimod treatment group (23.5%) and the placebo treatment group 
(10.0%). With this sample size, there will be 9 6% power to detect a difference of 12.5% in the 
other primary endpoint of clinica l remission at Week  12, assuming a placebo rate at 6.0%. The 
lower bound of overall power for both primary endpoints (as coprimary endpoints) is at least 
90%; and since the two primary endpoints are expected to be at least moderately positively 
correlated,  the actual overall power to reject both of their null hypotheses is likely to be greater 
than 90%.

The primary analysis of the proportion -based efficacy endpoints will be carried out using the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) method, stratified by (a) naïve  to biologic or JAK inhibitor  
therapy  at study entry (yes  or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), and (c)  baseline 
disease activity (MMS: 4  to 6 or 7  to 9). Results will be expressed as the number of subjects in 
remission, remission percentages, difference in remission percentages, odds ratio, and 
associated 95%  confidence intervals (CIs) and p -values.

Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.0 
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 13 of 103 Testing strategy  
There are multiple null hypotheses for the comparison of etrasimod and placebo in  the primary 
and key secondary endpoints. The family -wise type -I error rate will be controlled at a fixed 
α level at 0.025 (1 -sided) using the following testing procedure. First, the whole α will be 
spent on testing both primary endpoints. This study will be considered as an overall success 
only if both primary null hypotheses are rejected, each at the α  level (as coprimary 
hypotheses). This study will be considered as a partial success if only one of the two primary 
null hypotheses are rejected at α/2 if t he other has p  > α. 
Only if both of the primary null hypotheses are rejected, each at the α  level, can testing 
proceed for the 8  key secondary endpoints. The method for such testing will be specified in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), and it will cont rol for the multiplicity of the [ADDRESS_180147] version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities and tabulated by [CONTACT_39960]. Incidence of adverse 
events, serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events leading to discontinuation will be 
summarized and present ed in descending order of frequency. Associated laboratory parameters 
such as hepatic enzymes, renal function, and hematology values will be grouped and presented 
together. Individual subject values will be listed and values outside of the standard referen ce 
range will be flagged. Shift tables and analyses of changes from baseline will be produced.  
Interim analysis  
The Sponsor may conduct an interim analysis for sample size re -estimation based on blinded 
(aggregate) data to assess the appropriateness of the  assumptions used in the original sample 
size calculation. The planned sample size will not be reduced as a result of the sample size re -
estimation - to ensure sufficient exposure data for safety assessment. An interim SAP will 
provide detailed interim anal ysis specifications. The SAP charter will be finalized prior to any 
interim analysis and will be provided to regulatory agencies in a timely manner. This interim 
analysis will not be used to evaluate efficacy or safety.

1.1. Ulcerative Colitis   
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) describes conditions with chronic or recurring immune 
response and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract . There are 2  major types of IBD: Crohn’s 
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These are chronic recurrent, remittent, or progressive 
inflammatory conditions that may affect the entire gast rointestinal tract (CD) and the colonic 
mucosa (UC), and are associated with an increased risk for colon cancer  (Kaser 2010 ). 
Ulcerative colitis is characterized by [CONTACT_155799] 95% of cases and may extend proximally in  a symmetrical, 
circumferential, and uninterrupted pattern to involve parts or all of the large intestine (Kornbluth 
2010 ). Symptoms for UC can vary, depending on the location and severity of inflammation, but 
some of the most common are diarrhea, abdominal cramps , and rectal bleeding . The hallmark 
clinical symptom is bloody diarrhea often with prominent symptoms of rectal urgency and 
tenesmus (Kornbluth 2010 ). 
Treatment for subjects with UC is generally for symptomatic care (relief of symptoms) and 
mucosal healing and includes 5  major classes of medications: 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA), 
antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators , biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( eg, tumor necrosis factor 
[TNF] inhibitors and anti -integrins)  and most recently Janus kinase ( JAK) inhibitor therapy . 
These drugs may be prescribed in a “step -up” approach, with escalation of the medical regimen 
until a response is achieved, or a “step -down” manner, with initiation of treatment with biologics 
and immunomodulators  (Rowe 2020 ). 
An unmet medical need exists for the development of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_155743], particularly as most patients treated with biologics 
experience inadequate responses . Moreover, many patients who receive biologics lose 
responsiveness over time, even though their initial response may have been positive  (Ungar 
2016 ). 
1.2. Etrasimod   
Etrasimod (APD334) i s an orally administered , selective, synthetic sphingosine 1 -phosphate 
(S1P)  receptor  1, 4, 5 modulator  that is being developed to treat immune -mediated inflammatory 
disorders, including UC . 
The S1P 1 is a cell surface expressed protein that has been shown to regulate lymphocyte 
migration out of lymphoid tissues (Brinkmann 2010 ). Synthetic small molecule S1P [ADDRESS_180160] as functional antagonists by [CONTACT_155800], thus inhibiting lymphocyte migration out of lymphoid tissues and lowering the 
amount of peripheral blood lymphocytes available to be recruited to sites of inflammation . 
Modulation of the S1P/S1P receptor axis is thought to be a potential therapeutic  approach to the 
management of immune -mediated inflammatory disorders (Nielsen 2017 ); as such, etrasimod is 
expected to potentially provide therapeutic bene fit to patients with UC . A Phase  [ADDRESS_180161] s with moderately to severely active UC demonstrated consistent and 
clinically meaningful improvements in endpoint measures reflecting cardinal symptoms of UC 
and objective findings of endos copic improvement  (Sandborn 2020 ). Refer to the current edition 
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301

Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 24 of 103 of the In vestigator ’s Brochure (IB) for a complete summary of the clinical and nonclinical data 
relevant to the investigational product and its study in human subjects . 
1.3. Benefit/ Risk Assessment   
Considering the significant unmet need for safe and effective, orally  administered treatments for 
UC, etrasimod may potentially provide therapeutic benefit via S1P receptor modulation.  
Adverse events that have been reported wi th S1P receptor modulators include bradycardia at the 
first dose or atrioventricular ( AV) block, macular edema, hypertension, headache, cough, 
dyspnea, back pain, influenza, and diarrhea . 
Safety and tolerability of etrasimod has been evaluated in Phase  [ADDRESS_180162] been evaluated in Phase  2 studies of subjects with moderately to severely active  UC 
(refer to the current edition of the  IB). Etrasimod was found to be safe and well tolerated in these 
studies, with no clinically significant safety concerns with respect to vital signs, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), pulmonary function tests  (PFTs) , ophthalmoscopy, or clinical 
laboratory tests . Etrasimod produced a dose -dependent sustained decrease in total lymphocyte 
count, which is expected given etrasimod’s  mechanism of action . Lymphocyte counts were 
within normal limits  by [ADDRESS_180163] dose . 
Detailed information regarding the known an d expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected adverse event s of etrasimod can be found in the IB . 
Based on the mechanism of action of etrasimod and prior experience with other agents acting via 
a similar mechanism, monitoring for specific safety pa rameters are planned for this study, which 
include: auscultation of the lungs as part of the physical exam; PFT, exclusion of subjects with 
macular edema or retinopathy, with assessment of optical coherence tomography  (OCT) 
occurring throughout the study; and exclusion of subjects with certain cardiac risks, with 
assessment of vital signs in the period following dosing . 
• Auscultation of lungs will be conducted as part of the physical exam ination . 
• Prospective subjects with a hi story of macular edema or retinopathy will be excluded 
from the study . All randomized subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_155801], 
periodically throughout the treatment period , and as clinically indicated any time 
during the study . 
• Subjects with certai n cardiac risk s will also be excluded from the study . Randomized 
subjects will be monitored in a period following dosing , and vital signs will be 
assessed for determination of the subject’s health before discharge . Subjects requiring 
follow -up monitoring w ill be evaluated in the clinic  until cardiac variances return to 
acceptable levels . 
Based on the preclinical and clinical data that has been generated from etrasimod studies and the 
precautions outlined above, the favorable benefit/risk assessment justifie s the further clinical 
development of etrasimod in subjects with moderately to severely active UC and the current 
Phase  3 study.

Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.0 
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 25 of 103 The current study is a Phase  3 multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study 
to evaluate the efficacy and saf ety of etrasimod in subjects with moderately to severely active 
UC. Subjects who complete the total 52 -week treatment or subjects with worsening disease after 
the Week  12 visit assessments (Section  5.1.1 ) will have the opp ortunity to enroll into an 
open -label extension (OLE) study that will provide additional information on the long -term 
efficacy and safety of etrasimod . The results from this  study will be used to suppo rt the 
regulatory approval of e trasimod for the treatment of patients with UC.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES   
2.1. Primary  Objective   
The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of etrasimod on clinical remission in subjects with 
moderately to severely active UC after 12 and 52  weeks of treatment . 
2.2. Secondary  Objective   
The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of etrasimod on clinical response, symptomatic 
response and remission, end oscopic changes, corticosteroid -free remission, and m ucosal healing 
in subjects with moderately to severely active UC at timepoints up to 52  weeks of treatment . 
2.3. Safety  Objective   
The safety objective is to assess the long-term safet y of etrasimod after d aily doses of 2  mg for 
up to 52  weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active UC . 
2.4. Other  Objectives   
Other objectives include evaluation of etrasimod pharmacokinetics (PK) and the effect of 
etrasimod on health -related subject -reported outcomes and biomarkers . 
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
3.1. Summary of Study Design   
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of etrasimod [ADDRESS_180164] s with moderately to severely active UC . The study 
consists of a 28-Day Screening Period, a 12 -Week Treatment Period, a 40 -Week Treatment 
Period, and a 2 -Week and 4 -Week Follow -Up Period  (Figure  1). Eligible subjec ts will be 
randomized (2:1  ratio) to receive either etrasimod (2  mg once daily) or matching placebo (once  
daily) in a double -blind fashion for up to 52  weeks of treatment (12-Week Treatment Period + 
40-Week Treatment Period). Randomization will be stratified by (a)  naïve  to biologic or JAK 
inhibitor  therapy  at study entry (yes  or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use ( yes or no ), and  
(c) baseline disease activity ( modified Mayo score [MMS ]: 4 to 6 or 7  to 9). 
The target subject population will includ e (approximately 50% of subjects  in each of the 
following categories ): 
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301 
Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.[ADDRESS_180165] had an inadequate response  to, loss of response  to, or intolerance to a 
biologic or JAK inhibitor (subjects in this category may have received prior conventional 
therapy).  
Subject eligibility will be determined during a 4 -Week (28 -Day) Screening Period . Entry criteria 
will be based on confirmation of moderately to severely active UC, defined by a n MMS of 
4 to 9, which includes  an endoscopic score ( ES) ≥ 2 and rectal bleeding (RB) score ≥  1. 
At the end of the 12-Week Treatment Period , subjects will  undergo Week  12 efficacy and safety 
assessments and be evaluated for clinical response/remission  as well as UC disease worsening . 
Subjects whose UC condition in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_155744], compared with baseline (Week  0/Day  1), as defined in Section  5.1.[ADDRESS_180166] the option to enter an OLE study  (Study  APD334 -303). 
Subjec ts must complete Week  12 to be eligible for the OLE . Subjects who do not meet disease 
worsening criteria, including those demonstrating  clinical response/remission at Week  12 will 
continue into the 40 -Week Treatment Period and continue their double -blind treatment. Disease 
worsening will continue to be monitored by [CONTACT_155802] 40 -Week Treatment Period 
(ie, from Weeks  13 to 52). Subjects who either experience disease worsening in the [ADDRESS_180167] on -treatment  visit/Early Termination  visit

3.2. Rationale for Study Design   
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in subjects with 
moderately to severely active UC . Subjects may continue existi ng nonbiologic therapy for UC 

Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301 
Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.0 
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 27 of 103 (eg, 5-ASA, corticosteroids) per the  concomitant medication and dose stabilization criteria . As 
preexisting  background therapy is allowed, a placebo comparator is justified.  
The duration  of study treatment  is up to 52 weeks, which includes 12 - and 40 -Week Treatment 
Periods . The 40 -Week Treatment Period is expected to provide adequate time for separation of 
efficacy effects between etrasimod and placebo.  The 2 -Week and 4 -Week Follow -Up visits will 
provide off -treatment safety i nformation.  
The etrasimod dose of 2  mg once daily is based on findings of previous Phase  1 and Phase  2 
studies , and in particular data from the Phase  2 APD334 -003 placebo -controlled study . In the 
APD334 -003 study,  subjects received etrasimod 1  mg, etrasimo d 2 mg, or  placebo . Subjects in 
the etrasimod 2  mg group experienced a statistically significant improvement in the primary 
endpoint, the mean difference from placebo at Week  12 in the adapted Mayo score ( least square s 
mean [standard error] difference:  −0.99 [0.42]; p  = 0.0091) compared with placebo. The 
etrasimod 2  mg group also experienced significant improvement in all secondary endpoints 
compared with the placebo group at Week  12 including , improvement in the total Mayo Score 
(estimated least squares  mean [standard error] difference from placebo:  −1.27 [0.55]; 
p = 0.0100), and higher percentage of subjects with endoscopic improvement (41.8%, difference 
from placebo: 24.4%, p  = 0.003).  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the 1 mg, 2  mg, and placebo groups were 
reported for 59.6%, 56.0%, and 50.0% of subjects , respectively ; treatment -related TEAEs were 
reported for 7.7%, 10.0%, and 5.6% of subjects , respectively ; serious adverse events (SAEs) 
were reported for 5.8%, 0%, and 11.1% of su bjects , respectively ; and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment  were reported for 5.8%, 8.0%, and 0% of subjects , 
respectively . No subjects died during the study. Overall, the [ADDRESS_180168], widely used, and are in accordance with the nonbinding US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Draft Guidanc e for Industry , Ulcerative Colitis: Clinical Trials Endpoints  
(FDA 2016 ). Other endpoints for the study are widely used and considered reliable measures of 
efficacy and safety . 
As detailed in  Section  10.2, the study is powered to the primary endpoint for demonstrating a 
statistically significant difference in clinical remission between etrasimod therapy and placebo at 
Week  52. The 2:[ADDRESS_180169] s meeting predefined eligibility criteria from  the end of the 12 -Week Treatment Period 
and during the 40 -Week Treatment Period will be eligible to enter  the APD334 -303 OLE study  
(Section  5.1.1 ) provided they meet all entry criteria .

An independent Data M onitoring Committee (DMC) will be utilized to monitor the safety of 
subjects and to enhance the integrity and credibility of the study. The roles and responsibilities of 
the DMC are described in detail in the DMC Charter.  
The DMC will abide by [CONTACT_155803], Clinical Trial 
Sponsors, Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees  (FDA 
2006 ). As part of its role, the DMC will conduct reviews of accumulating safety and efficacy 
data at specified intervals during the conduct of the trial, according to the guidelines detailed in 
the DMC Charter. DMC recommendations to the study team will be commu nicated in a blinded 
fashion (ie, treatment assignment for individual subjects will not be shared). To ensure the 
scientific integrity of the study, members of the DMC will not be directly involved in the

normaliz ed ratio > 1.5) 
− ALT or AST >  3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>  5%) 
Because transient fluctuations of ALT or AST are commo n, and progression to severe 
drug-induced liver injury or acute liver failure is uncommon, automatic discontinuation of study 
treatment upon finding a greater than 3  × ULN elevation of ALT or AST may be unnecessary.  
Subjects who discontinue treatment prema turely, regardless of the reason, should be instructed to 
return for an Early Termination (ET) visit within [ADDRESS_180183] administration of study 
treatment ( Table  7 and Table  8) and before initiation of any new treatments to complete all of the 
ET assessments. If a subject discontinues due to pregnancy, they are not required to complete the 
endoscopy. If the ET visit is within [ADDRESS_180184] sigmoidoscopy and biopsy, these 
procedures do not need to be repeated.  
If the ET visit is ≥  [ADDRESS_180185] administration  of study treatment, the 2 -Week Follow -Up 
visit is not required ; however, the 4 -Week Follow -Up vis it should be scheduled and completed . 
If the ET visit is ≥  [ADDRESS_180186] administration  of study treatment, the 4 -Week Follow -Up 
visit is not required  unless the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is not within normal limits .

Each subject will be dispensed blinded study treatment  at study visits ( Table  7 and Table  8). 
6.5. Blinding   
This is a double -blind study with limited access to the randomization code. The study treatment  
and placebo tablets and bottles are identical in physical appearance. The treatment each subject 
receives will not be disclosed to the Investigator, study site staff, subject, Sponsor  personnel 
involved with the conduct of the study (with the exception of  the clinical supply staff and 
designated safety staff), or study vendors. The IWRS will hold treatment codes and bottle 
numbers for study treatment . 
Treatment assignments should remain blinded unless that knowledge is necessary to determine 
subject emerge ncy medical care . In case of an emergency, the Investigator has the sole 
responsibility for determining if unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment is warranted  to 
provide appropriate medical care . Subject safety must always be the first consideratio n in making 
such a determination.  The IWRS is programmed with blind -breaking instructions to guide the 
Investigator on how to obtain treatment assignment in the event of an emergency unblinding. 
The Investigator is requested to contact [CONTACT_155810] . If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor  must be notified within 
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301 
Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.[ADDRESS_180198] be recorded in 
the source documentation and  electronic case report form (eCRF), as applicable.  
For Suspected, Unexpected, Serious Adverse Reactions, the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
designee responsible for managing SAEs, will access the IWRS to obtain the subject’s treatment 
assignment for the purp ose of regulatory reporting.  
If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded  prior to Week  12 for any reason, they will be 
discontinued from the study.  Subjects who are unblinded on or after Week 12 may be eligible to 
enroll into the OLE study (Section  5.1.1 ). 
6.6. Treatment Compliance   
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to  ensure that subject s are correctly instructed on how to 
take their study treatment  and that each subject  is compliant with their assigned regimen.  The 
study treatment  should be dispensed by [CONTACT_737], or by a qualified individual under the 
Investig ator’s supervision . An up-to-date treatment inventory/ dispensing record must be 
maintained as described in Section  8.4. 
Subject compliance will be based on tablet  count . Tablet  counts  < 80% or >  120% of the 
expected value between visits should be documented as a protocol deviation.  If there is a 
discrepancy b etween the tablet count and the subject’s compliance per the eDiary, it should be 
discussed with the subject and noted in the source documents.  
6.7. Concomitant Therapy   
All over-the-counter and prescribed  concomitant medications, blood products, procedures, 
vitamins, and holistic products, administered during the Screening Period and during the study  
through the safety reporting period  must be recorded in the eCRF, as appropriate . 
6.7.1.  Required Concomitant Therapy   
Not applicable.  
6.7.2.  Allowed Concomitant Therapy   
Concomitant medication for medical conditions other than UC are permitted as clinically 
indicated subject  to specific protocol requirements outlined in Section  4.1 and Section  4.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Permitted Medications for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis   
Oral 5-ASA, AZA, 6 -MP, oral corticosteroids, or medicinal probiotics  are allowed at the time of 
screening and as per the inclusion criteria ( Section  4.1); however, these products  should not be 
started  during screening or during the treatment period  in subject s who are not already receiving 
them . Immunosuppressive agents such as oral AZA or [ADDRESS_180199] be discontinued ≥ [ADDRESS_180200] s receiving 5 -ASA or medicinal probiotics  should maintain a stable dose throughout the

During the 12-Week Treatment Period , subject s are to maintain their stable baseline 
corticosteroid dose.  
Following the Week  [ADDRESS_180201] s entering the 
40-Week Treatment Period . The recommended tapering schedule for oral corticosteroids (other 
than budesonide extended -release tablets [budesonide MMX]) is as follows:  
a. Dose >  10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent: Taper daily dose by 5  mg/week until 
receiving 10  mg/day, and then continue ta pering at 2.5  mg/week until 0  mg/day  
b. Dose ≤  10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent: Taper daily dose by 2.5  mg/week until  
0 mg/day  
The recommended tapering schedule for subject s receiving oral budesonide MMX 9  mg/day is to 
reduce tablets to [ADDRESS_180202] s who cannot tolerate the corticosteroid taper without recurrence of clinical symptoms 
of either UC or steroid withdrawal, the corticosteroid dose may be increase d (up to the dose at 
study entry if required), but tapering should begin again within 2  weeks.

9.3. Screening and Eligibility   
Subject  eligibility will be assessed based on protocol  inclusion and exclusion criteria. All 
screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm potential subjects meet all 
eligibility criteria.  
Screening procedures must be completed within [ADDRESS_180209] dose of study 
treatm ent (Table  7). The Screening Period may be extended for subjects who require additional 
diagnostic testing/consults to determine status of either latent TB  or C. difficile  infection . If the 
subject is pla nned to be randomized >  28 days from the signing of the informed consent form 
(ICF), the  Medical Monitor should be consulted to see if repeat ed testing is needed.  The 28 -Day 
Screening Period may also be extended on a case -by-case basis to accommodate reaso nable 
delays in specific screening assessments (eg. pulmonary  function tests [PFTs], optical coherence

counts, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, natural killer lymphocytes (TBNK), serum chemistry, 
virology, thyroid panel, coagulation, urinalysis, high -sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs -CRP), TB 
screen, and stool sam ple should be obtained and results must be available and reviewed prior to 
randomization. In the case of new clinical laboratory abnormalities detected prior to 
randomization, the eligibility of the subject should be reconsidered with the guidance of the 
Medical Monitor.  
9.3.11.  Proctosigmoidoscopy /Colonoscopy and Modified May o Score Derivation   
• Proctosigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy must  be performed prior  to randomization  of 
treatment to allow central reader review (may take approximately 5 -12 days) and 
confirmation of eligibility . Preferably, proctosigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy  should be 
performed after other criteria for inclusion (eg, laboratory criteria) have been met.  
• Determination of MMS score  to qualify for randomization:  
− The MMS will be evaluated at Day  1. The subscores for SF and RB are derived 
from the subject eDiary entries using the scores from the [ADDRESS_180214] recent 
consecutive days within the 7  days prior to the day of bowel preparation 
(excluding the day of bowel preparation ), averaged and rounded to the nearest 
integer. The scoring will be calculated electronically. Subjects who  do not have

(captured as subsequent Follow -Up visit or unscheduled visit).  
All adverse event s should be recorded for [ADDRESS_180235] administration  of study treatment  
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2 ). 
9.6. Virtual/Hybrid Visits   
Study visits after Day 1 may be conducted via onsite (in person at the study site or spec ialty lab), 
offsite (home health visit by [CONTACT_155818]), virtual (eg, telephone, video conference), or 
hybrid (a combination of aforementioned visit types) depending on the nature of the study 
assessment, technological capability, and acceptabil ity with institutional practices and in 
alignment with local law and regulatory requirements. These may take place on different days 
within the study visit window.  
Certain assessments and/or procedures will not be performed in the home setting (eg, 
endosco pi[INVESTIGATOR_014], OCT, PFT, cardiac monitoring following treatment initiation or re -initiation, and 
12-lead ECG).  
Pregnancy testing and central laboratory assessments (eg, blood, stool, and urine samples) can be 
performed by [CONTACT_155819].  
Asses sments or procedures that may be conducted virtually, if allowed by [CONTACT_155820], include for example: informed consent process including obtaining written informed 
consent, medical and medication history to assess eligibility criteria, review of demographic 
information, social history, AE query, review of concomitant medications, eDiary training, and 
compliance review/monitoring including study drug administration and questionnaires.  
During a virtual assessment, a subject may report an AE that requires a follow -up symptom -
focused physical exam or diagnostic test, as determined by [CONTACT_737]. In this scenario, the 
Investigator may have the subject return to the study site for an unscheduled study visit to 
perform the assessment.  
For study d rug accountability, the medication bottle and remaining tablets may be visually 
inspected and counted on video conferencing. Subjects must return the dispensed bottle with the 
remaining tablets along with any empty bottles to the study site at the next ons ite visit. See 
Section  8 for study treatment management.  
Regardless of how a study visit and its associated procedures are conducted, all study procedures 
should be performed by [CONTACT_155821].  
Study visits are designated accordingly in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table  7 and Table  8).

Blood samples for analysis of etrasimod, and if warranted M3 (AR503641) and other 
metabolite(s) of interest , will be collected at the following timepoints  from all subjects who 
received at least 1  dose of study drug (etrasimod or placebo) : 
• Pre-dose and at 4 hours (± 15 minutes) post-dose (after 12-lead ECG ) on 
Week  0/Day  1 
• Pre-dose (trough ; within 60  minutes prior to  dosing ) at Weeks  2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 
32, 40, 48, and 52  
• At 2-Week and 4 -Week Follow -Up visits  
• If possible , at the time of any SAE or adverse event  leading to study treatment  
discontinuation  
Subjects should be instructed to document the time of their last dose prior to the study visit and 
the time must be recorded in the eCRF . The time of administration of study treatment  during the 
study visit must also be recorded in the source along with the time of each PK sample.  
Blood samples will be processed for collection of plasma fractions for determination of the 
concentrations of etrasimod, and if warranted M3 (AR50 3641) and other metabolite(s) of 
interest . For the placebo group, a selected number of samples will be analyzed.  
Plasma PK samples may als o be used for profiling of drug -binding proteins, bioanalytical 
method validation purposes, stability assessments, met abolite assessments, or to assess other 
actions of etrasimod with plasma constituents . 
No urine samples will be collected  for PK analysis .

9.8. Efficacy  Assessments   
The components of the MMS are used to calculate several of the primary, secondary,  
 endpoints . The definition s for MMS components are outlined  in Section  10.5. 
9.8.1.  Modified Mayo Score/Mayo Clinic Score   
This study utilizes the MMS, which includes the ES, RB, and SF components of the Mayo Clinic 
score ( MCS ; Appendix  3) to assess UC disease activity in support of the primary and secondary 
endpoints . The t otal score range  of the MMS is from 0 to 9, with each component ranging from 
0 to 3 (0 = normal, 1  = mild, 2  = moderate, 3  = severe).  
The MMS requires daily subject -reported  RB and SF scores; therefore, the importance of daily 
recording of RB and SF by [CONTACT_1130] s in their daily eDiary  should be stressed by [CONTACT_32366] . 
Endoscopy will be used to visualize the mucosa to enable calculation of the ES .

Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 54 of 103 Endoscopic score (ES) : The ES reports the worst appearance of the mucosa on flexible 
sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, on a 4 -point scale ( Appendix  3). Consistent with regulatory 
advice, thi s study excludes friability from the definition of an ES of 1 . The ES will be 
determined by a blinded central reader.  
Rectal bleeding (RB) : The RB subscore is a subject -reported  measure. This item reports the 
most severe amount of blood passed per rectum in a 24 -hour period , on a 4 -point scale 
(Appendix  3). The subject  will record this in their daily eDiary . The method for calculating the 
RB subscore is described in Section  9.4.2 . 
Stool f requency (SF):  The SF subscore is a subject -reported  measure . This item reports the 
number of stools in a [ADDRESS_180236]  in 
the same period, on a 4 -point scale ( Appendix  3). A stool is defined as a trip to the toilet when 
the subject has either a bowel movement, passage of blood alone, passage of blood and mucus, 
or passage of mucus only. The total number of stools passed in a 24-hour period will be recorded 
by [CONTACT_2181] a daily eDiary. The reference “normal” SF for that subject will be recorded 
electronically at the Screening Visit  and is the number of stools in a [ADDRESS_180237] has never achieved remission, the reported SF before initial  
onset of signs and symptoms of UC  will be used as the reference SF. The method for calculating 
the SF subscore is described in Section  9.4.2 . 
Physician’s Global Assessment  (PGA): The PGA is a physician -reported measure that is a 
component of the MCS  and is used in the calculation of the total Mayo Score . The PGA 
summarizes the I nvestigator’s assessment of the subject ’s UC disease activity on a 4 -point scale  
(Appendix  3). The Investigator will record the PGA in the site tablet at the specified study visits 
(Table  7 and Table  8). Consistent with regula tory guidance, the PGA will not be used for 
primary or secondary efficacy ass essment in this study . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Endoscopy   
A flexible proctosigmoidoscopy, performed with a video  endoscope following cleansing 
preparation (oral or rectal cathartic), will be performed during screening (prior to 
Day 1/randomization ), at Week  12, and at Week  52/Early Termination visit. Additional 
proctosigmoidoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_155757] e worsening and are required for 
qualification into the OLE (Section  5.1.1). 
To ensure quality data and standardization, the same endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_155758]. Endoscopy images will be obtained during each endoscopy and will be 
sent for central reading and determination of the Mayo endoscopic score. A detailed image 
review charter from the central reading laborator y will outline the endoscopic procedures, video 
recordings , and equipment. For each subject, a video recording of the entire endoscopic 
procedure will be performed using an acceptable storage medium. The endoscopic recordings 
will be read centrally in a bl inded manner for mucosal lesions and endoscopic severity by a 
qualified gastroenterologist according to the image review charter. The ES will be evaluated  by 
[CONTACT_155822]. The central read will be used for determination  of efficacy 
endpoints; however, treatment decisions will be made by [CONTACT_64372].

without a surveillance colonoscopy within 12  months prior to  baseline  (Section  4.1, Inclusion 
Criterion  6), a colonoscopy and biopsies taken in accordance with local standard of care at 
screening to rule out dysplasia (ie, in place of screening proctosigmoidoscopy) is required . Any 
adenomatous po lyps must be removed prior to their first administration  of study treatment . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Endoscopic Biopsies   
Per inclusion criteria (Section  4.1), a histopathology report supporting the diagnosis of UC must 
be available in the source documents prior to randomization. Post-randomization detected polyps 
or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_155759].  If a 
histopathology report is not available, the screening endoscopy may serve as such with histology 
evaluated at the local histology laboratory.  
Biopsies will be obtained at each endoscopy to suppo rt assessment of the histopathology 
endpoints . Up to 4  biopsy 
pairs (ie, total 8) will be collected  from the most affected area  15 to 25 cm from the anal verge . 
For subjects with proctitis only at baseline, biopsies should be taken 8  to 10 cm from the anal 
verge.  
The original location (colonic segment) of biopsy specimens acquired at screening must be 
clearly indicated.  Detailed instructions for endoscopic biopsies ( eg, number of biopsies, anatomic 
site, normal or inflamed mucosa) will be provided . 
Biopsy samples will be processed by a central laboratory and h istopathologic scoring  using the 
Geboes , Robarts, and Nancy histopathology  (Appendix  4) indices  will be  performed by a blinded 
central histopathology reader  (Geboes 2000 , Marchal -Bressenot 2017 , Mosli 2017 ). 
Biopsy specimen transfer, processing, slide preparation and digitization of slides for 
histopathologic  scoring procedures will be detailed in a histopathology manual. Histopathology 
results will not be made available to study sites.  
9.8.2.  Extraintestinal Manifestations   
During the speci fied full physical examination s (Table  7 and Table  8) specific systems (such as 
eyes, liver, skin, and joints) will be examined for EIMs for UC. 
9.8.3.  Additional Health -Related Subject -Reported Outcomes   
Subject -reported  quality of life instruments will be completed electronically and checked for 
completeness at the study site as indicated in the Schedules of Assessments (Table  7 and 
Table  8) and will be used in support of the efficacy outcomes.  
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ):  The IBDQ  is a validated 32-item 
questionnaire used to assess  health -related quality of life  (HRQoL ) in subject s with IBD (UC and 
CD). Response to each of the questions is graded from 1  to 7 with overall score ranging from 32 
(very poor HRQoL) to 224 (perfect HRQoL).

Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 56 of 103 Ulcerative Colitis Patient -Reported Outcomes Signs and Symptoms (UC -PRO/SS):  The 
UC-PRO/SS is used to gather data on the gastrointestinal  signs and symptoms of UC directly 
from the subject . The UC -PRO/SS is a 9 -item questionnaire containing 2 domains: bowe l 
movement signs and symptoms (6  items) and abdominal symptoms (3  items). An average score 
is calculated for each domain; a higher score indicates worse symptoms . The UC -PRO/SS  will 
be administered if and when available.  
Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short Form Health Survey (SF -36), Version  2 Physical 
and Mental Component and Domain Scores : The SF-[ADDRESS_180239]  health.  The SF -36 consists of 36  questions measuring 8  health domains: physical 
functioning, bodily pain , role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to 
emotional problems, general health perceptions, mental health, social function, and vitality . The 
subject ’s responses are solicited using Likert scales that vary in length, with 3  to 6 response 
options per item.  The SF -36 will be scored using 2  overall summary scores: physical component 
summary and mental component summary scores.  
Work Productivity and Ac tivity Impairment Questionnaire – Ulcerative Colitis  
(WPAI -UC): The WPAI -UC consists of [ADDRESS_180240]’s ability to work and perform regular activities.  
Urgency Numeric Rating S cale (NRS):  The urgency NRS is a single item that measures the 
severity for the urgency (sudden or immediate need ) to have a bowel movement in the past 
24 hours using an 11 -point NRS ranging from 0 (no urgency) to 10 (worst possible urgency) . 
Abdominal Pain NRS : The abdominal pain NRS is a single item that measures the “worst 
abdominal pain in the past 24  hours” usin g an 11 -point NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain 
as bad as can imagine) . 
9.8.4.  Efficacy -Related Biomarkers   
Samples for biomarker assessments will be collected according to the Schedule s of Assessments 
(Table  7 and Table  8). Blood , tissue,  and stool samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_134326] . Details for collection, processing , and storage will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual . Residual samples will be stored and may be used for additional analyses if  
the subject has granted consent where allowed by [CONTACT_155824].  
C-reactive protein (CRP):  CRP is an acute phase protein expressed by [CONTACT_155825] a hs -CRP assay . Investigators will be 
blinded to the hs-CRP results  during the treatment and follow -up periods . 
Fecal calprotectin:  Fecal calprotectin is a complex consisting of calcium -binding proteins . It is 
expressed by [CONTACT_155826] (and to a lesse r extent by [CONTACT_141709]) and 
fecal levels correlate with the number of neutrophils in the gut . It is used as a biomarker of 
intestinal inflammation. Investigators will be blinded to the  fecal calprotectin results  during the 
treatment and foll ow-up periods . 
Lymphocyte counts : Etrasimod is believed to modulate lymphocyte trafficking resulting in a 
reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count and lymphocyte availability for recruitment to sites of 
inflammation . During the treatment period, the Invest igator will be blinded to the white blood 
cell (WBC) and differential counts  during the treatment and follow -up periods . During the 
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301

(not providing direct medical ov ersight of study conduct) . If either of the following occur, the 
unblinded Medical Monitor will notify the Investigator with additional instructions.  
• ANC <  1000  cells/ μL 
• ALC  < 200 cells/ μL 
If the ANC is confirmed below the 1000  cells/µL limit, the Investigator will be requested to 
closely monitor for serious infection and institute appropriate follow -up at his or her discretion.  
If the ALC is confirmed below the 200  cells/µL limit, study treatment should be interrupted and 
should not be reinitiated if the ALC remains below this threshold. In this situation, the unblinded 
Medical Monitor will notify the Investigator and provide instructions on additional actions that 
the Investigator may need to take. When there is at least one measurement of ALC 
< 200 cells/µL, blinded values may be released to treating physicians and Investigators as 
deemed medically necessary to monitor infection and/or aid in diagnostic work -up as clinically 
indica ted, and/or as a tool to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions for an infection. 
Investigators will repeat CBC with differentials weekly until ALC >  500 cells/µL . 
Re-initiation of the study treatment can only be considered when ALC >  500 cells/µL .

Thoracic Society/European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_155762] (MacIntyre 2005 , Miller 
2005a , Miller 2005b ). 
The safety of trial subject s and site staff is paramount, so it is at the Investigator’s discretion 
whether PFT can be safely administered to trial subjects  during the treatment period. The 
Investigator should evaluate on a case -by-case basis how best to proceed based on the subject’s 
medical history, the Investigator’s clinical judgment, and in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor. All reasonable effo rts should be made to ensure safety and adherence to the protocol. 
When available, spi[INVESTIGATOR_155763]. If the decision is made that it is not appropriate to conduct PFTs due to the safety  
concerns (eg , COVID -19 transmission), then this decision and rationale should be appropriately 
captured in the subject’s source documentation. When available and safe (due to lifting of local 
restrictions, re -opening of local PFT labs, or improved safety conditions) the tests should be 
conducted as soon as possible and as close to the timepoints as outlined in the protocol.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Drugs of Abuse  
A standard urine drug screen will be performed ( Table 6 ). Subjects who test positive will be 
assessed for eligibility  for study participati on by [CONTACT_737]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test for β-hCG will be performed on women of childbearing potential to 
determine eligibility. Post-scr eening urine pregnancy tests ( β-hCG) should be performed as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table 7  and Table 8 ). A monthly home pregnancy 
test in non-visit months should be  performed in countries where allowed per local regulation and 
any positive result immediately reported to the study site. If no t allowed per local regulations, 
this pregnancy test will be performed on site duri ng an unscheduled visit. If at any point there is 
a case of a positive urine β-hCG test, the subject will have study treatment interrupted and a 
serum sample submitted to the central laboratory for β-hCG testing. If the serum test confirms 
positive, the subject will be withdrawn from th e study treatment and all the necessary follow-up 
assessments will be conducted as per Section 9.10.9. If the serum test is negative, the subject 
may resume study treatment. 
Negative pregnancy test results must be docum ented for all women of childbearing potential 
prior to dosing at applicable study visits. Wo men who are surgically sterile or who are 
postmenopausal are not considered to be of childb earing potential. Postme nopausal is defined as 
12 consecutive months with no menses w ithout an alternat ive medical cause.

Section  9.6 for timing of blood draws for PK). 
9.10.8.  Adverse Events   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definitions   
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Adverse Event   
An adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigational 
subject  administered a medicinal product and  which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event  can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered rela ted to the medicinal product.  
Adverse events  can be any of the following:  
• Unfavorable changes in general condition  
• Subjective or objective signs/symptoms  
• Concomitant disease or accidents  
• Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters over the course of the 
study  
• Preexisting conditions that worsen in severity , increase in  frequency , or have new 
signs/symptoms  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Serious Adverse Event   
An adverse event should be classi fied as an SAE  if it meets one of the following criteria:  
Fatal:  Adverse event resulted in death . 
Life-threatening:  The adverse event  placed the subject at immediate risk of death. This 
classification does not apply to an adverse event  that hypothetically 
might cause death if it were more severe.  
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301 
Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.0 
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 66 of 103 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  The adverse event  required or prolonged an existing inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155767] -ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_155833] . 
Disabling/ 
incapacitating:  The adverse event r esulted in a persistent or significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct norm al life 
functions.  
Congenital anomaly 
or birth defect:  An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject exposed to the 
molecule or study treatment regimen before conception or during 
pregnancy.  
Medically significant:  The adverse event  did not meet any of the above criteria but could 
have jeopardized the subject and might have required medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above or 
involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an 
infectious agent.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Adverse Drug Reaction   
An a dverse drug reaction (ADR) in the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medicinal 
product o r its new usages, particularly as the therapeut ic dose(s) may not be established , is any 
noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product related to any dose . The phrase 
“responses to a med icinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product 
and an adverse event  is at leas t a reasonable possibility (ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Adverse Events of Special Interest   
Based on the mechanism of action of etrasimod and prior experience with other agents acting via 
a similar mechanism, potential adverse event s of special interest may be identified. In addition to 
appropriate  reporting of these events as an adverse event  or SAE, supplementary detailed 
information may be collected.  
If there are any signs of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) -related symptoms, 
the Investigator should withhold study treatment and perform appropriate diagnostic evaluation 
per local standard of care at the first sign s suggestive  of PML. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_155768], progress over days to weeks, and may include progressive weakness on one 
side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, 
and orientation leading to confusion and personality  changes. The Investigator must notify the 
Medical Monitor of such an event.  
Guidance for the Assessment of Potential Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy  is 
provided in Appendix  5. 
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301 
Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.0 
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 67 of 103 [IP_ADDRESS].5.  Severity   
The severity of each adverse event  will be assessed at the onset by a nurse/or physician. When 
recording the outcome of the adverse event  the maximum severity of the adverse event  
experienced will also be recorded. The severity of each adverse event  will be graded according to 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version  5.0 (CTCAE v 5.0): 
Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 : Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL).  
Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155769]; disabling, 
limiting self -care ADL ( eg, preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_19640], using the telephone, managing money) . 
Grade 4 : Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 : Death related to adverse event . 
[IP_ADDRESS].6.  Relationship   
The Investigator (or designee) will make a determination of the causal relationship of the AE to 
the study drug using a 4 -category system according to the following guidelines:  
Not Related : The AE is definitely caused by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or the study 
procedure/conditions.  
Unlikely Related : The temporal association between the AE and the drug is such that the 
drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE.  
Probably Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the drug and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_93735]’s clinical state, environmental, or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or 
hypothesized cause -effect relationship, and (if appropr iate) reappears 
when the drug is reintroduced.  
The Investigator  will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship . Alternative causes, 
such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the 
temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment  administration should be considered and 
investigated . The Investigator  should consult the IB and the Product Information of marketed 
products  within the drug class , when applicable . For each adverse event /SAE, the Invest igator  
must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event /SAE and has 
provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and 
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301 
Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.0 
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 68 of 103 the Investigator  has minimal information to include in the initia l report to the Sponsor ; however, 
it is very important that the Investigator  always make an initial assessment of causality for every 
event before the initial transmission of the SAE to the Sponsor . The Investigator  may change 
his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_155770] -up report with the updated causality assessment . The causality assessment is one of the 
criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Eliciting  and Recording Adverse Events   
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Eliciting Adverse Events   
Subject s will be instructed that they may report adverse event s at a ny time . An open -ended or 
nondirected method of questioning should be used at each study visit to elicit the reporting of 
adverse event s. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Recording Adverse Events   
The adverse eve nt reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject  is initially 
included in the study (date of first signature [CONTACT_43998]) and continues up to [ADDRESS_180252]  questioning, discovered during 
physical examination, laboratory testing, and/or other means by [CONTACT_155834]/or SAE Form, as appropriate . The following information should be recorded on  the adverse 
event  eCRF:  
• Description including onset and resolution dates  
• Whether it met SAE  criteria  
• Severity  
• Relationship to study treatment  or other causality  
• Outcome  
For SAEs, events occ urring secondary to the primary event should be described on the eCRF in 
the narrative description field . 
The following should be considered when recording SAEs:  
• Death is an outcome of an event . The event that resulted in the death should be 
recorded and repor ted on the eCRF . 
• For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], surgical, or diagnosti c procedures, the illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301 
Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.0 
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 69 of 103 itself . The procedure should be captured in the narrative as part of the action taken in 
response to the illness.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Diagnosis Versus  Signs or Symptoms   
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listi ng out of individual symptoms . 
Groupi[INVESTIGATOR_44971] a diagnosis should only be done i f each component sign and/or 
symptom is a medically confirmed component of a diagnosis as evidenced by [CONTACT_45014] . If any aspect of a sign or symptom does not fit into a classic pattern of the diagnosis, 
report the individual symptom as a s eparate adverse event . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting Adverse Events   
All SAEs are subject  to reporting requirements . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Serious Adverse  Events   
Any adverse event  considered serious by [CONTACT_91564]-investigator or that meets 
serious criteria should be  reported to the designated safety contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24  hours of becoming 
aware of the event  (or in India within 24  hours of event occurrence) . Enter the SAE 
information into eCRF, and send other ava ilable pertinent information (eg , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
laboratory results, etc) to the designated Sponsor Contact.  
IQVIA Pharmacovigilance  
 
 
 
If additional information is required or becomes available for a previously reported SAE, entry 
of the new information into eCRF should be completed within 24  hours of awareness.  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478] /or surgery for clearly preexisting conditions (eg, a surgery that has 
been scheduled prior to the subject’s entry into the study) will not be reported as an SAE.  
Any SAE that is ongoing when the subject completes the study or discontinues the study will b e 
followed by [CONTACT_155835], stabilized or returned to baseline status.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Serious, Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions   
All ADRs that are both serious and unexpected are subject to expedited reporting to regulatory 
agencies. An unexpected ADR is one for which the nature or severity is not consistent with 
information in the relevant source documents.  
Since etrasimod is an investigational medicinal product that has not yet been approved for 
marketing in any country, the IB in effect during the study will serve as the Reference Safety 
Information for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected.  
9.10.9.  Pregnancy   
If at any point a serum β -hCG pregnancy test is positive , the subject will be withdrawn from the 
study treatment . 

Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301 
Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.[ADDRESS_180253] dose.  
Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to study treatment ) does not meet the definition 
of an adverse event ; however, to fulfill regulatory requirements, any pregnancy and/or pregnanc y 
outcome should be reported via the Pregnancy Report Form to the designated Sponsor Contact  
[INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_180254] data on the pregnancy and on the outcome for both the 
mother and the fetus . 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous ab ortion, fetal death, stillbirth , congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and should be reported  as such (following 
the SAE reporting process) even if outside the SAE reporting period . 
9.11. Procedures for Overdose   
The current edition of the IB should be referenced for overdose procedures.  
There is no established overdose threshold for this clinical study, nor is there any recommended 
specific treatment for an overdose but to provide supportive care if clinically indicated.  
In the event of a suspected overdose, the Investigator and/or treating physician should:  
1. Closely monitor the subject for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities and follow the 
AE reporting pr ocess, including contact[CONTACT_155836].  
2. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within [ADDRESS_180255] data for all randomized subjects will be presented in data listings . All 
efficacy and safety  endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] . Full details of the 
statistical considerations and planned analyses will be described in the study Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP).  
10.2. Determination of Sample Size   
Based on a 2 -group Fisher’s exact  test, a 1 -sided significance level of 0.025, and a 2:1 
randomization ratio, 420 total subjects (28 0 etrasimod, 140 placebo) are required to achieve 
93.4% power to detect a difference of 13.5% in the primary endpoint of clinical remission at 
Week  52 between the etrasimod treatment group (23.5%) and the placebo treatment group 
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334 -301 
Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.0 
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 71 of 103 (10.0%). With this sample size, there will be 9 6% power to detect a difference of 12.5% in the 
other primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week  12, assuming a placebo  rate at 6.0%.  The 
lower bound of overall power for both primary endpoints (as coprimary endpoints) is at least 
90%; and since the two primary endpoints are expected to be at least moderately positively 
correlated, the actual overall power to reject both o f their null hypotheses is likely to be greater 
than 90%. 
10.3. Analysis Sets  
All analysis sets  will be defined in the SAP prior to database lock . The following analysis sets 
may be used in the statistical analysis:  
Full Analysis Set (FAS) : The FAS will consist of all randomized subject s, who receive  at least 
[ADDRESS_180256] s will be  counted in the treatment group to 
which they were randomiz ed, regardless of the treatment received during the study . 
Per Protocol  Set: The P er Protocol  Set will consist of all subject s in the FAS who adhere to the 
protocol . This set will be used in sensitivity analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints 
to evaluate the influence of major protocol violators and protocol deviators on the primary 
results. Subject s may be excluded from this set if they violate the eligibility crit eria or 
significantly deviate from the study plan . Specific reasons for warranting exclusion from this set 
will be documented prior to database lock and may include, but are not limited to, study 
treatment  noncompliance, receiving incorrect study treatment , and missing a defined number of  
visits while still on study.  The SAP, which will be finalized prior to database lock, will be the 
final documentation for the P er Protocol  definition.  
Modified Full Analysis Set  (mFAS ): The mFAS  will consist  of all randomized subjects, who 
receive  at least [ADDRESS_180257] the needed data for inclusion in the mFAS  for 
some endpoints but others may not . 
Safety Set: The Safety Set will include all randomized subject s who receive  at least [ADDRESS_180258] s discussed above will be considered as having a known out come at the analysis 
timepoint  (ie, a treatment failu re outcome ) and not as having missing data . Subject s who

Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.[ADDRESS_180259] model with repeat ed measure s. Detailed meth ods will be provided in the SAP . 
Sensitivity Analyses for Missing Data  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed under several alternative assumptions regarding missing 
data, ie, data missing intermittently, after discontinuation from the double -blind study for reasons 
other than worsening diseases, or after initiation of exclud ed medications.  
• An assumption of data missing at random (MAR) within each treatment group will b e 
investigated. Missing data, eg, component scores of MMS at the planned assessment 
timepoints, will be imputed using multipl e imputation methodology  (Rubin 1987 ) 
under the MAR assumption. Binary responder -type endpoints will subsequently be 
computed from observed and imputed data and analyzed using the same method as in 
the primary analysis. Continuous  endpoints will be analyzed using analysis of 
covariance based on observed and imputed values.  
• A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_155771] t he number of responders and 
nonresponders among subjects with missing data in each treatment group. The results 
of analysis for all possible combinations will be summarized graphically, depi[INVESTIGATOR_155772] a 
boundary between combinations that result in a statistically  significant treatment 
effect versus  not statistically significant. Clinical plausibility of the combinations on 
the bou ndary will be discussed in the clinical study r eport to evaluate robustness of 
study conclusions to missing data.  
• A mechanism of missingness not at random will be investigated for subject s with 
missing data. These subject s, regardless of the randomized treatment group, will be 
assumed to have a similar distribution of outcomes after discontinuation as subject s 
with available data in the placebo group . This is akin t o modeling the missing 
outcomes as if the subject s continued on their background therapy o nly and 
accounting for the study  effect observed in subject s on placebo . This will be 
implemented using a multiple imputation approach of Copy Refere nce to impute 
missing values, eg, component scores of MMS at the planned assessment timepoints.  
Complete descriptions of the sensitivity analyses and detailed multiple imputation method and 
procedures will be provided in the SAP prior to database lock .

• Clinical response using Total Mayo Clinic score: A ≥  3-point and ≥  30% decrease 
from baseline in Total Mayo Clinic score, and a ≥  1-point decrease from baseline in 
RB subscore or an absolute RB subscore ≤  1 
10.5.1.  Calculation  of Modified Mayo Score Component Scores   
In general, t he MMS symptom scores will be computed from the e Diary data within 7  days prior 
to the target analysis timepoint (eg, Weeks  12 and 52) . Complete details of the MMS symptom 
score computation method are provided Section  9.3.10  and Section  9.4.2 .

Phase  3, 52 -Week Study in UC ( ELEVATE UC 52 )  Amendment  4.0 
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 77 of 103 10.11.  Safety Endpoints   
• Incidence and severity of adverse event s 
• Incidence and severity of laboratory abnormalities, and change from ba seline in 
laboratory values (to include hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and 
urinalysis)  
• Incidence of clinically significant vital sign abnormalities and changes from baseline  
10.12.  Testing Strategy   
10.12.1.  Efficacy Analysis   
The primary analysis of the proportion -based efficacy endpoints will be carried o ut using the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) method, stratified by (a) naïve  to biologic or JAK 
inhibitor  therapy  at study entry (yes or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use ( yes or no ), and (c) 
baseline disease activity (MM S: 4 to 6 or 7  to 9). Results will be expressed as the number of 
subjects in remission, remission percentages, difference in remission percentages, odds ratio, and 
associated 95%  confidence intervals (CIs) and p -values.  
There are multiple null hypotheses for the comparison of etrasimod and  placebo in the primary 
and key secondary endpoints. The family -wise type-I error rate will be controlled at a fixed 
α level at 0.025 (1 -sided) using the following testing procedure. First, the whole α will be spent 
on testing both of the primary endpoints . This study will be considered as an overall success only 
if both of the primary null hypotheses are rejected, each at the α  level (as coprimary hypotheses). 
This study will be considered as a partial success if only one of the two primary null hypotheses  
are rejected at α/2 if the other has p  > α. 
Only if both of the primary null hypotheses are rejected, each at the α  level, can testing proceed 
for the [ADDRESS_180261] reference 
range will be flagged. Shift tables and analyses of changes from baseline will be produced. The 
change from baseline for each of the vital signs and 12-lead ECG  param eters will be 
summarized. Incidence of abnormal vital signs parameters and outlier 12-lead ECG  results will 
be tabulated.

g Subjects will begin eDiary entries beginning the first day of screening after eDiary training is completed. The eDiary should be compl eted daily to capture data including daily 
SF and RB (the [ADDRESS_180272] -reported outcome measures contributing to the calculation of the MMS), and study treatment administration. The subject eDiary  will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_155851] . 
h The MMS will be calculated electronically at the Day  1 and Week  12/Early termination visits. The subscores for SF and RB are derived from the subject eDiary entries using the 
scores from the [ADDRESS_180273] recent consecutive days within the 7  days prior to the da y of bowel preparation (excluding the day of bowel preparation), averaged and rounded to the 
nearest integer (Section  9.3.10 ). 
i Stool frequency and RB subject -reported outcomes will be recorded daily using electronic subject eDiaries . The RB and SF subscores will be calculated as indicated in 
Section  9.4.2 . 
j Safety vital signs (resting heart rate and systolic and diastolic BP, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) taken wit h subjects in the sitting position will be performed at 
Screening and prior to randomization on Week  0/Day  1 (baseline). If the subject’s heart rate is <  50 bpm, or systolic BP  < 90 mm Hg, or diastolic BP  < [ADDRESS_180274] not be randomized and should be considered a screen failure.

Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 94 of 103 APPENDIX 2: TUBERCULOSIS SCREENING   
All subjects must undergo screening for a history of TB infection and testing for latent/active TB 
infection. Their medical history review must include specific questions about a history of TB or 
known occupational or other personal exposure to individuals  with active TB. Subjects should be 
asked about past testing for TB, including chest radiograph results and results of 
interferon -gamma release assay (IGRA, eg, QuantiFERON -TB Gold In -Tube, T -SPOT TB) or 
response to tuberculin skin test (TST) and history o f Bacillus Calmette -Guérin vaccination.  
a. Subjects without a history of latent or active TB who have a negative IGRA or TST 
result at screening are eligible to enroll in the study.  
b. A TB questionnaire will be completed for all subjects (refer to questionnaire  below) 
during the  Screening  period.  
c. For subjects residing in countries with a high burden of TB or MDR TB as identified 
by [CONTACT_120055], the TB screening questionnaire will be completed  at every study visit  (per 
protocol schedule s of assessments) . For subjects who  are receiving TB prophylaxis 
treatment the TB questionnaire will be completed  at every study visit (until TB 
prophylaxis treatment course is completed).  This questionnaire will monitor for any 
emergent symptoms of active TB and compliance with any TB prophylaxis t reatment .

history of active/latent TB infection.  
− Subjects with past or current history of ac tive TB, regardless of treatment history, 
are excluded from enrollment.  
− Subjects with a history of latent TB infection diagnosed prior to screening must 
have documentation of treatment with at least four weeks of an acceptable TB 
prophylaxis treatment regi men to qualify for enrollment. It is the responsibility of 
the investigator to verify the adequacy of previous TB treatment and provide 
appropriate documentation  (Direct Observation Therapy report where available).  
e. Acceptable TB prophylaxis treatment regim ens for latent TB is defined according to 
local country guidelines. If no local country guidelines for the treatment of latent TB 
exist, WHO guidelines must be followed.  
f. Subjects with a newly identified positive IGRA (one retest is allowed with approval 
from the Medical Monitor per Section  9.3.1 ) or TST result at Screening must be 
considered a Screen Failure, however they are eligible for rescreening once they 
undergo an evaluation to rule out active TB (chest x -ray to rule out pulmonary T B) 
and initiate an acceptable TB prophylaxis treatment regimen for latent TB at least 4 
week s prior to rescreening (with a plan to complete the TB treatment course during 
study participation)  before they can be considered for enrollment.  For subjects

g. An assessment of adequacy of the TB prophylaxis treatment regimen and duration of 
treatment must be performed by [CONTACT_155852] . 
h. IGRA and TST interpretation  
− Subjects will be considered to  have a negative diagnostic test for TB if at least 
one of the following circumstances applies:  
− Negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold test.  
− Combination of a negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold test and negative  
purified protein derivative  ([COMPANY_003]) TST (in countries where IGRA is not 
considered a validated test) . 
− A combination of two indeterminant QuantiFERON -TB Gold tests and a negative 
[COMPANY_003] TST  (in countries where IGRA is not considered a val idated test) . An 
indeterminant IGRA test result should be repeated. In the event that the second 
IGRA test result is also indeterminate, the subject may be enrolled without 
treatment for latent TB if his/her chest radiograph shows no abnormality 
suggestive  of TB (active or old, inactive TB) and the subject has no additional 
risk factors for TB as determined by a physician TB expert  physician.  
− If the IGRA is not considered a validated test or is not registered for use in the 
subject’s coun try, a negative TST  result is required to rule out latent TB infection.  
− A positive TST reaction is ≥  10 mm of induration, or ≥  5 mm of induration for 
subjects receiving equivalent of prednisone >  15 mg/day for any medical 
conditions and subjects residing in countries identif ied by [CONTACT_155853] a high TB 
burden country or high MDR  TB burden country .

Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 100 of 103 APPENDIX 4: HISTOLOGICAL SCORING INDICES   
Geboes Grading System  
The Geboes Grading System is a stepwise grading system used for the evaluation of microscopic 
inflammation and histopathologic disease activity in UC.  The microscopic appearance of the 
mucosa is categorized into 6 grades.  A decrease of the Geboes Score grading system to Grade 
zero (0) or one (1) indicates mucosal healing  (Geboes 2000 ). 
Nancy Histological Index  
The Nancy Histological Index  is a validated index for assessing histological disease activity in 
UC. It is composed of three histological items defining five grades of disease activity: absence of 
significant histological disease (grade 0), chronic inflammatory infiltrate with no acute 
inflammatory infiltrate (Grade 1), mildly active disease (Grade 2), mo derately active disease 
(Grade 3), and severely active disease (Grade 4). The presence of ulceration on the biopsy 
specimen corresponds to severely active disease (Grade 4). If there is no ulceration, acute 
inflammatory cells infiltrate (presence of neutro phils) is assessed. Moderate or severe acute 
inflammatory cells infiltrate corresponds to moderately active disease (Grade 3), while mild 
acute inflammatory cells infiltrate correspond to mildly active disease (Grade 2). If there is no 
acute inflammatory c ells infiltrate, assessment of chronic inflammatory infiltrate (lymphocytes 
and plasmacytes) is made. A biopsy specimen showing moderate or marked chronic 
inflammatory infiltrate corresponds to moderate or marked chronic acute inflammatory infiltrate 
(Grad e 1). A biopsy specimen showing mild or no chronic inflammatory infiltrate corresponds to 
absence of significant histological disease (Grade 0) (Marchal -Bressen ot 2017 ). 
Robarts Histopathology Index  
The Robarts Histopathology Index ( RHI) is an evaluative index , derived from the Geboes score,  
that is designed to be reproducible and responsive to clinically meaningful change in disease 
activity over time. The total R HI score ranges from 0 (no disease activity) to 33 (severe disease 
activity)  and is calculated as follows: RHI = 1 × Chronic inflammatory infiltrate + 2 × Lamina 
propria neutrophils + 3 × Neutrophilis in epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] + 5 ×  Erosion or ulceration  (Mosli 2017 ).

PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL 
LE[LOCATION_006]OENCEPHALOPATHY   
If a subject exhibits signs and symptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_25691], the Investigator must interrupt 
study treatment and perform a targeted neurologic examination to assess for signs of PML, 
which are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and may  include progressive weakness on one 
side of the body or clumsiness of limbs or difficulty with walking or writing or fine motor skills, 
disturbance of vision, changes in thinking, memory and orientation leading to confusion and 
(expressive aphasia), and/o r agnosia (receptive aphasia).  Consultation with a local neurologist 
may be warranted, as presented in the PML case evaluation algorithm in  Figure  2. 
The Medical Monitor should be informed of any suspected cases of PML and, if needed, will 
facilitate investigator/local neurologist consultation with PML medical experts on the 
independent adjudication committee.

Note: IP dosing may resume, and no further evaluation is needed if the Investigator assessment reveals no objective signs of 
PML, the local neurologist confirms that the subject  does not have PML, or the IAC’s review of the evidence concludes that 
PML is ruled out.

Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 2 of 14 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Amendment 2.0, 20 December  2019  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European  Parliament and the Council of the European Union 
because it significantly impacts the safety or physical/mental integrity of subjects.  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment  
The overall rationale for this amendment is to address update criteria for early (ie , prior to 
Week  52) enrollment in the open -label study and eligibility criteria (eg, list of prior therapy 
failures or non -response, contraception use, cardiovascular disease history, and prior therapy 
washout period). Additional instructions for safety mo nitoring related to [ADDRESS_180307]  were 
added. In addition, a 4-Week Follow -Up visit was added .

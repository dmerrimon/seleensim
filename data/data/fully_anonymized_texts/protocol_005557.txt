Page 2 of 15 Thirty Million Words: Well Baby [CONTACT_552765] ( TMW -WB) is a public health intervention 
that aims to impact parents’ beliefs about  their role is in creating a stimulating and enriching 
language environment for their baby. This comparative study of will evaluate the effectiveness of 
promoting critical language and cognitive development in infants of low -SES English - and Spanish -
speakin g parents. TMW -WB will target infants zero to six months and their parents  during routine 
Well Baby [CONTACT_552766], one month, two months, four months, six months , and a final 
nine month follow -up. Developed in both English and Spanish, TMW -WB will integrate education 
and technology into a scalable multimedia platform . This educational intervention will impact 
maternal awareness and knowledge about the importance of children’s early language 
environment.  
 
Theoretical Background 
The Well Baby I nitiative is both an extension and a focused adaptation of the larger Thirty 
Million Words Initiative (TMW®) . TMW -WB is grounded in three main bodies of literature and 
research. The first is research on early childhood language acquisition, child development, and child 
behavior. The foundation of our evidence- based curriculums derives from the differences found in 
child ren’s language environments, which largely depend on socio -economic status (Hart and Risley 
1995). Second is research on maternal health education and health literacy, specifically on prenatal, 
perinatal and postpartum education. Third is research and data on the impact of bilingual language 
environments on early childhood language development. Additionally, this project addresses a high priority topic for both patients and health care providers that has long -term implications for 
educational and health trajectories for low -SES children. In regards to making informed decisions 
about their children’s language and cognitive development, research has shown that a gap  exists 
between the anticipatory guidance parents want to receive,  and the guidance that is prov ided by 
[CONTACT_552767] -focused interventions . Therefore, TMW -WB aims to increase parental 
knowledge of early childhood language development  and to identify the most effective way to 
provide consistent anticipatory guidance to caretakers. We aim t o bring these bodies of research 
together to craft a public health intervention using existing initiatives while also adding an 
important educational component.  
 
Importance of Language Acquisition on Cognitive Development:  
A child’s early language exposure is pi[INVESTIGATOR_552753] (Bruner, 1981; Chapman, 2000; Gallaway & Richards, 
1994; Hart & Risley, 1995; Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, Selzer, & Lyons,  1991; R owe, 2008). Hart and 
Risley’s landmark study demonstrated the tremendous impact of a child’s early language milieu on 
future learning by [CONTACT_354134] a significant correlation between the number of words a child is 
exposed to between ages 0 -3 and his or her u ltimate IQ and academic success (Hart & Risley, 1992; 
1995). Their findings were both significant and alarming, demonstrating the critical and time -
sensitive role that early language exposure plays in a child’s life.  
 
The concern for  children born into poverty is the overwhelming inequity in their early 
language experience. Hart and Risley’s study revealed a steep socioeconomic gradient in early exposure to words and language. At the end of their third year, children from high socioecon omic 
status (SES) families heard approximately forty -five million  words; children from economically 
impoverished backgrounds heard only approximately thirteen million . Hart and Risley found that 
Protocol Version 10/ 1/[ADDRESS_726641] scores at three years and 
older. Their follow -up with these children at 9 -10 years of age confirmed that preschool/school 
interventions came too late to alter these trajectories; the reverberations of early linguistic shortfall 
were likely to follow these children throughout their lives.  
 
However, the challenges these children  face  is not unalterable. It is neither genetics nor a 
lack of potential that lie at the heart of this inequity, but rather parental knowledge. In 2008, Rowe demonstrated  that the relationship between socioeconomic status and parental communication 
ability is mediated by [CONTACT_480659] (Rowe 2008). Other studies have corroborated these findings, demonstrating that the effect of socioeconomic status on a child’s vocabul ary was 
primarily dictated by [CONTACT_480660] (Hoff 2003). Encouragingly, studies have also demonstrated that a well -planned, parent -directed language intervention in low -income populations may 
positively affect parental speech behaviors by [CONTACT_552768] (Oneil -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_125415], 2009).  
 
Additionally, in families where neither parent has native English proficiency, parents may 
choose to speak English with their children to aid their transition into an English -speaking  school 
system. However, research reveals that native language input is more supportive of language and 
cognitive development than nonnative language input. (Place & Hoff, 20 11; Winsler et al., 2014)  
This strongly suggests that both quantity and quality of input matters for successful early child 
language development. Additionally, native input is critical since native proficiency in one language 
facilitates the acquisition  of another language (Oller & Eilers, 2002) . 
 
Addressing the Gap in Anticipatory Guidance  
Even though parent knowledge of child development has been shown to mediate language 
outcomes for low -SES children, parents report that early learning topi[INVESTIGATOR_552754] (Dungy, 
2000; Young, Davi s , Schoen, & Parker, 1998) . Patients’ unmet needs include psychosocial concerns 
for children , and guidance in understanding how children grow and develop (Hickson, Altemeier, & 
O’Connor, 1983; McCune, Richardson, & Powell, 1984; Young et al., 1998) . 
 
Practitioners agree about the need for anticipatory guidance, but report multiple barriers 
and wide variability in their use of screening tools (Sand et al., 2005) . In a review conducted by 
[CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_206920], Talavera, and Mayer (2009) , health care providers cited  time constraints, limited staff, 
and lack of knowledge and resources for specific recommendations and preventative care (Kogan et 
al., 2004; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_552755]., 2009) . Similarly, Coker’s and colleagues’ (2013)  systematic review 
revealed that the need for research on effective anticipatory guidance methods and redesign of 
patient -centered str ategies to improve Well Baby [CONTACT_552769] a priority among 
health care providers (Chien et al., 2006; Coker et al., 2013) .  
 
The proposed study is designed to fill this gap  in anticipatory guidance  from birth to six 
months of age by [CONTACT_552770] s with the information they seek regarding childhood 
development. It aims t o determine the most effective and scalable way to improve healthcare 
delivery and increase parent knowledge, child language outcomes, and parent -child interaction.  
 
A Participatory Model of Educational Intervention:  
The TMW -WB educational intervention is  currently being designed and planned with 
iterative participation and feedback from the audience we seek to have an impact on. Exploratory 
and formative qualitative research informs the intervention, drawing insights from mothers in 
immediate post -partum,  parents, and healthcare providers. Our intervention is being developed 
Protocol Version 10/ 1/2019  
Page 4 of 15 with focus groups and individual interviews with mothers and parents, consultation with medical 
professionals (RNs, OB GYNs, Pediatricians), and visits to community health centers and in Chicago 
to understand the feasibility of implementation during recommended well baby [CONTACT_41995].  
 
While the earlier TMW intervention was developed for toddlers, the TMW -WB intervention 
will be tailored for parents of newborns and infants. The advantage of T MW -WB is the employment 
of multiple touch points to disseminate information to parents, allowing for a continuous flow of 
information. The utilization of the recommended well baby [CONTACT_552771] a platform for the TMW  
educational intervention ensures that paren ts receive information that parallels their baby’s 
present developmental stage rather than being predictive of future behaviors. The curriculum will 
include messages and strategies specifically for children from birth to six months of age with a 
focus on p reverbal communication and mother -child attachment.   
 
The significance of the Well Baby [CONTACT_552772] a Public Health Initiative  
The Well Baby [CONTACT_552773] a public health effort to raise awareness about the critical 
importance of early childhood languag e development. For the intervention, TMW -WB will be 
integrated into the recommended and routine postpartum Well Baby [CONTACT_41995]. If successful, we aim to 
scale the TMW -WB Initiative to the national level so that the Well Baby [CONTACT_552774] a ll parents to watch during routine Well Baby [CONTACT_552775]. As a public health approach to 
disparities in early language environments, cognitive development, and later school readiness, 
TMW -Well Baby  [CONTACT_552776] a new st andard of care for pediatricians.  
 
 
Purpose  
The purpose of the proposed study is to determine the efficacy of a multi -media educational 
curriculum , presented as interactive video module,  in strengthen ing the early learning 
environments of vulnerable children , and positively impact ing their language and cognitive 
development . Through evidence- based strategies, the TMW -WB curriculum teaches parents how to 
harness the power of their words to build their chil d’s brain and impact their child’s learning 
trajectory.  
We hypothesize that the TMW -WB intervention will be more effective in improving parent 
knowledge of child language development, parent -child interactions, and child language outcomes 
for low -SES Engli sh and Spanish -speaking families than  the Neutral Video  or Usual Care 
comparator s (more on these below) .  Additionally, we expect that parents who receive the TMW -
WB educational intervention will report receiving more consistent anticipatory guidance and 
demonstrate an improved understanding of the critical importance of their child’s early language environment for cognitive development and school readiness. The hypot hesis relies on the existing 
research data supporting the idea that parental understanding and beliefs will alter parental behavior, and consequently, that increased parental linguistic input will impact their child’s cognitive development.  
We propose a  three armed  randomized -controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
Thirty Million Words -Well Baby [CONTACT_552777] -SES 
infants ; specifically  impacting parent s by [CONTACT_552778] , parental language inpu t and parent -child interaction, and c hildren by [CONTACT_552779] -parent interaction  The Thirty Million Words -Well Baby 
[CONTACT_552780]  (arm 1 ). The Neutral Video arm  (arm 2), 
will act as the first control  group.  In the Neutral Video  arm, participants  view educational video s 
about infant safety . A second control group,  the Usual Care  arm  (arm 3), will receive care as usual at 
their clinic.  The same divisions will be made for those participants in the Spanish -speaking group.

At the one -month  Well Baby [CONTACT_765], participants in the Usual Care  arm of the study will 
receive care as usual. Participants in the Neutral Video  arm will watch the first of four  short video s 
(approximately 5-10 minutes)  about infant safety . Patients in the TMW -Well Baby  [CONTACT_552782] 1 video  intervention. This module present s information on child language and cognitive 
development. Video s will be shown in the waiting room, or during the period after the nurse 
completes the child’s vitals and before the pediatrician sees the patient. Should a  video still be 
running when the pediatrician enters the room, it will be stopped and completed after the 
pediatrician has left. After the visit, patients in all arms will be asked to complete the P ost-Visit 
survey about their visit , indicating the areas and level of anticipatory guidance they received during 
their visit, their overall satisfaction levels, and their unmet needs for guidance and requests for 
more information.  At this visit, the health clinic may collect information using a standardized 
depressio n scale . This  provides information on the covariates parental language ability and 
depression level. R esults  from the depression scale  will be shared by [CONTACT_102]’s pediatrician, both 
because pediatricians need to administer a depression  scale anyway and in an effort to reduce 
burdens associated with housing the study in the clinic.  If the clinic does not administer a 
depression scale , the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)  will be administered by [CONTACT_75275].  
 
At their two -month  Well Baby [CONTACT_765], patients in the TMW -Well Baby  [INVESTIGATOR_216] s will watch  the 
Module [ADDRESS_726642] PCI teaching task , which is a 
measure for assessing parent -child interaction via scalable teaching tasks that parents teach their 
children . Finally, t he depression scale  results will be shared by [CONTACT_102]’s pediatrician , as well as

teaching scale task with the ir child. At this visit, the MacArthur -Bates Communicative Devel opment 
Inventories: Short Form Vocabulary Checklist:  Level 1 (MacArthur- CDI)  will be administered . 
Finally, the depression scale  and ASQ results will be shared  by [CONTACT_102]’s pediatrician , if 
applicable . 
 
At their twelve -month  Well Baby [CONTACT_765], all patients complete the Family Life Events,  SPEAK 
and TOPSE surveys  again . Participants  will also participate in a third  NCAST PCI teaching scale task 
with their child. T he MacArthur -Bates Communicative Development Inventories  Short Form

child development, and the Pearlin Mastery Scale . 
 
 
Recruitment  
Participa nts will be recruited from Lawndale Christian Health Center  (LCHC) , Advocate 
Medical Group (AMG),  Friend Family Health Center at the University of Chicago Medicine (FFHC) 
and PCC Community Wellness Center (PCC). All study locations  are federally qualified health 
center s in Chicago serving low -SES English -speaking and Spanish -speaking families and their 
infants.  Patients will be recruited in the clinic waiting room before being called in for the infant’s

number, and email address) in a pass word -protected database.  
 
Randomization 
We will use the website Research Randomizer to generate a randomization table. We will 
use the service to generate a dummy set of 500  unique unsorted numbers where each unique 
number is paired with a participant number (1 -250, sorted). In an Excel spreadsheet, the first half 
of the dummy number set) will be assigned evenly to the Treatment  condition (arm 1)  and the 
other half will be assigned evenly to the Control  conditions (arms 2 or 3). Then, the data in the 
columns “participant”, “condition” and “dummy” will be sorted using the Excel “Sort by” function on 
the column “dummy”. The participant numbers are now unsorted and randomly assigned to either one of the two experimental conditions:  Treatment or Control. This will allow us to ensure equal 
sample sizes for all  treatment and control conditions.  A separate randomization table will be crated 
in the same way  for the Spanish -speaking group.  
 
Participants  
 Participants will include a goal o f 250  Spanish - and 250 - English speaking  parent -child 
dyads ( 500  parent -child  dyads ; a total of 1000  subjects)  from LCHC, AMG, FFHC,  and PCC . These 
participants  will be randomly assigned to either the TMW -Well Baby , Neutral Video , or Usual Care  
conditions in English or Spanish as described above. All 500  parent -child dyads will be allocated to 
one of the six experimental conditions : TMW -Well Baby  [CONTACT_460458] , Neutral Video  English, Usual Care  
English, TMW -Well Baby [CONTACT_437101],  Neutral Video Spanish  or Usual Care  Spanish.

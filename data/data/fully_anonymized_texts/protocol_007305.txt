8 1. OBJECTIVES 
1.1 Study Design 
This is a two-stage Phase 2 study assessing th e efficacy of cabozantinib (alone or in 
combination with trastuzumab) in patients  with metastatic breast cancer and brain 
metastases. Cabozantinib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine 
kinases (RTKs) including MET, VEGF r eceptor-2 (VEGFR2), RET, and KIT, when 
given as monotherapy.  The population to be studied will consist of patients with 
metastatic breast cancer with measurable central nervous system (CNS) lesions.  
Treatment will consist of once daily oral dos ing of cabozantinib (60 mg po day), during 
a 21 day cycle.  Patients will also receive trastuzumab (8 mg/kg IV loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) if th ey have a HER2-positive breast cancer.  
Patients will undergo restaging scans at [ADDRESS_174907]  the frequency of restaging scans reduced 
to once every 3 cycles. Patients with complete or partial responses, or stable disease, will continue to receive cabozantinib.  Patients with progressive disease will be taken off study.  Archival tissue from patients will be obtained if possible ( please refer to 
Appendix F  for archival tissue guidelines); however, if archival tissue is not 
available the patient may still participate in the study.  The patient will have an 
opportunity to participate in an optional tumor biopsy study;  however, the biopsy is not 
mandatory to participate in the study.  Goal accrual is 37 patients (up to 40 patients will be enrolled), including 21 HER2-positive patients, 8 ER-positive patients, and 8 triple-negative patients.  
1.2 Primary Objectives 
1) To evaluate the CNS objective response rate (ORR), defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1, in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and brain metastases  
1.3 Secondary Objectives 
1) To evaluate the CNS ORR in patients with  hormone receptor positive metastatic 
breast cancer and brain metastases by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 
2) To evaluate the CNS ORR in patients with triple-negative metastatic breast cancer 
and brain metastases by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_174908] cancer with brain metastases

9 3) To evaluate the CNS ORR in patients with HER2-positive, hormone receptor 
positive, and triple-negative metastatic breast cancer and brain metastases by 
[CONTACT_151981] 
4) To evaluate ORR in non- CNS sites (by [CONTACT_393] 1.1) 
5) To evaluate Progression-Free Survival (PFS) 
6) To evaluate the clinical benefit rate 
7) To evaluate site of first progression (CNS versus non-CNS) 
8) To evaluate overall survival (OS)  in total study population.  
9) To evaluate c-Met and phospho c-Met expression in archival tumor tissue 
10) To evaluate the incidence of c-Met amplif ied circulating tumor cells at baseline 
11) To evaluate potential plasma biomarkers of  cabozantinib when given in combination 
with trastuzumab 
12) To assess vascularity of CNS tumors, thro ugh descriptive analysis of tumor vessel 
size, cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, perfusion, and diffusion before and 
after exposure to cabozantinib 
13) To assess the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib wh en given in co mbination with 
trastuzumab 
14) To collect blood to study cell-free DNA for comparison to tumor specimens 
 
2. BACKGROUND 
2.1 Cabozantinib 
A summary of cabozantinib clinical and nonc linical experience is contained in the 
Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_151982] . The Investigator’s Brochure should be 
reviewed in conjunction w ith this study protocol.

10 Cabozantinib is a new chemical entity that inhibits multiple RTKs with 
growth-promoting and angiogenic properties. The primary targets of cabozantinib are 
RET, MET, VEGFR2/KDR, and KIT (see below).

MET 1.8 
VEGFR2/KDR 0.035 
KIT 4.6 
IC50, concentration required for 50 % target inhibition. 
In vivo data from pharmacodynamic experiments show that cabozantinib inhibits key RTKs that promote tumor cell proliferat ion and/or angiogenesis (RET, MET, and 
VEGFR2). In xenograft tumor models, cabo zantinib inhibited VE GFR2 phosphorylation 
in lung tissue, with an ED
50 of 26 mg/kg. The duration of  action for cabozantinib was 
sustained with > 50 % inhibition observed 10-[ADDRESS_174909]-dose at a dose level of 
100 mg/kg for all targets studied.  
Treatment with cabozantinib shows rapid eff ects on the tumor endothelium, resulting in 
breakdown of the vasculature beginning [ADDRESS_174910] cancer, human lung carcinoma, and rat glioblastoma. Overall, the data generated in vivo demonstrate that the target profile of 
cabozantinib translates to potent anti-angioge nic activity and potent anti-tumor efficacy. 
 
2.2 Cabozantinib Nonclinical Toxicology 
In nonclinical toxicity studies in rodent s and non-rodents, histopathological changes 
associated with cabozantinib administration were observed in gastroin testinal (GI) tract, 
bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adrenal, and reproductive tract tissues. 
Histopathological changes present in bone and pancreas were considered secondary to 
cabozantinib administration. Cabozantinib was negative in in vitro  bacterial, in vitro 
mammalian cell, and in vivo mammalian genotoxicity bioassays . In reproductive toxicity

11 studies, cabozantinib was embryotoxic in rats, produced fetal soft tissue changes in 
rabbits, and decreased fertility in male and female rats. 
Safety pharmacology studies of cabozantinib administration did not demonstrate adverse 
effects on neurobehavioral or respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]-system function in rats; furthermore, no 
significant changes in electrocardiographic parameters (including corrected QT [QTc] interval) were observed by [CONTACT_151983]. 
Cabozantinib was not an inhibi tor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 in vitro and is not 
predicted to have signifi cant effects on CYP3A4 inducti on. Cabozantinib was shown to 
be an inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2C19 isozymes, in vitro and was also a 
substrate of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism.  The mean plasma protein binding by 
[CONTACT_151984] 98%. 
Additional toxicology information may be found in the Investig ator’s Brochure. 
2.3 Clinical Experience of cabozantinib 
2.3.1 Clinical Summary 
The single agent maximum tolerated dose (MTD ) on the once daily (qday) oral dosing 
schedule has been determined to be 60 mg po qday. Details of all studies may be found 
in the Investigator’s Brochure. 2.3.2 Clinical Safety Profile 
The adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) data summarized in the 
following section includes those reported and en tered in the clinical database and safety 
database published as of July 2013 (IBv9). The clinical studies with cabozantinib are 
ongoing, thus the AE data from the clinical da tabase does not yet include all SAEs. Data 
from double-blinded studies are not presented. The severity of AEs was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for A dverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0.

12 20%) observed AEs, regardless of causality, were fatigue (66.7%), diarrhea (63.1%), 
decreased appetite (51.9%), nausea (51.9%), weight decreased (36.0%), PPES (35.9%), vomiting (34.1%), constipation (33.2%), dys geusia (28.0%), hypertension (27.8%), 
dysphonia (26.3%), abdominal pain (23.3%),  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
increased (23.0%), dyspnea (21.3%), head ache (20.9%), rash (20.4%), and ALT 
increased (20.2%). The safety profile of si ngle-agent cabozantinib is consistent across 
tumor types. 
The most frequently ( ≥ 20%) observed AEs reported as related to cabozantinib, were 
fatigue (60.0%), diarrhea (56.1%), decreased appetite (44.1%), nausea (42.4%), PPES 
(35.6%), weight decreased (29.1%), dysgeus ia (27.1%), hypertensi on (24.0%), vomiting 
(23.5%), dysphonia (22.0%), and AST increased (20.1%). 
The most common AEs (≥  5%) reported at severity of Gr ade 3 and above include fatigue 
(15.9%), diarrhea (11.1%), hypertension (9.7%),  PPES (8.9%), lipase increased (6.8%), 
PE (5.9%), abdominal pain (5.5%), decrea sed appetite (5.3%), and asthenia (5.0%).   
Serious Adverse Events Out of all 1311 subjects enrolled in open -label, single-agent clinical trials with 
cabozantinib, 688 subjects (52.5%) experienced  one or more SAEs recorded in the 
Argus Safety Database, and 300 (22.4%) subj ects experienced one or more SAEs that 
were assessed to be related to treatment with cabozantinib. The most commonly reported 
SAEs (≥ 2%) were pulmonary embolism (5.1%),  vomiting (3.4%), dehydration (3.2%), 
pneumonia (3.0%), nausea (3.0%), abdominal pa in (2.4%), diarrhea (2.4%), deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT; 2.1%), and convulsion (2.0%). subjects), abdomi nal pain (in three 
subjects), and perirectal abscess (in three subj ects). In addition, one late-breaking case of 
reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy s yndrome (RPLS) was reported after the data 
cut-off in the double-blinded placebo-controlled Study XL184-301. As of 28 February 2013, 192 fatal SAEs  were reported (182 on single-agent 
cabozantinib or cabozantinib in combination w ith other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 10 on placebo) across 
all open-label or unblinded company-sponsor ed studies (Studies  evaluated include

Detailed information regarding the safety profile of Cabozantinib from all studies may 
be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (version 9).  
2.3.4 Clinical Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis showed dos e proportional increases in maximum plasma 
concentration (C max) and area under the plasma concentration-vs-time curve (AUC) both 
for the powder-in-bottle (PIB) formulati on (dose range: 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg) and the 
capsule formulation (dose ra nge: 125 mg to 175 mg). Terminal-phase half-life (t 1/2, z) 
values were 59.[ADDRESS_174912] metabolism in humans may be found in the Investigator’s 
Brochure. 2.3.[ADDRESS_174913] been conducted. In a study employing nude mice dosed orally with

14 activity was also observed in differentia ted thyroid cancer (DTC; DCR = 73% at 24 
weeks) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC; medi an progression-free survival [PFS] = 12.9 
months). Observations of clinical activity have included decrease of soft tissue tumor 
lesions including visceral metastases, effects on metastatic lesions on bone scan (partial or complete bone scan resolution), reducti on in serum markers of bone resorption and 
formation, reduction in circulat ing tumor cells (CTCs; subjec ts with prostate cancer), 
increases in hemoglobin, and improvements in bone pain and reductions in narcotic use 
in subjects with bone metastases. Activity in MTC and CRPC subject s is described in 
more detail below. 
In the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study XL 184-301 in 330 MTC subjects, a significant 
increase in median PFS was seen in the ca bozantinib arm compared  with placebo (11.2 
vs 4.0 months; hazard ratio [HR] =0.28; 95 CIs: 0.19, 0.40). Confirmed PRs occurred in 
28% of cabozantinib-treated subjects and none  in the placebo arm; responses were 
durable (median duration 14.6 months). An unpla nned administrative analysis of overall 
survival (OS) performed at the request of the FDA with a data cut-off of 15 June 2012 
(75% of required deaths) showed a tr end for improved duration of OS in the 
cabozantinib arm compared with placebo (26.0 months vs 20.3 months; HR = 0.83; 95% 
CI: 0.60, 1.14). In the Phase 1 Study XL184- 001, with an enriched MTC population, 
PRs were reported in 29% of 35 MTC subjects with measurable disease across all dose levels and in 28% of [ADDRESS_174916] cl inical activity in 
men with CRPC (Smith et al. 2013). Duri ng the RDT phase, the majority of CRPC 
subjects with bone metastases and elevated to tal alkaline phosphatase  (t-ALP) levels at 
baseline showed reductions in t-ALP (S mith et al. 2013). Similarly, during the non-
randomized expansion (NRE) phase, the majo rity of CRPC subj ects at the 100 mg 
assigned dose showed reductions in circul ating bone specific alkaline phosphatase 
(BSAP) (Smith et al. 2012). These effects were independent of prior or concomitant bisphosphonate treatment. Reductions in bone bi omarkers were also evident in the 40 
mg CRPC NRE cohort (de Bono et al, 2012). Effects on bone scan were assessed by [CONTACT_151985], and pain and narcotic use were prospectively assessed using an 
interactive voice recording system (IVRS) and a diary. Subjects achieved a bone scan

15 response (BSR) in both the 100 mg and 40 mg assigned NRE dose cohorts (67% and 
49%, respectively). Among subjects with baselin e pain of at least 4 (0-10 scale by [CONTACT_151986] [BPI]), a majority had at least a decrease of 30% in the average daily 
worst pain compared with baseline in both cohorts (100 mg: 64% of subjects; 40 mg: 69% of subjects). In addition, more than half of subjects decreased narcotic use.

single agent and in combination ther apy for metastatic breast cancer. 
Trastuzumab is associated with the potential  for left ventricular cardiac dysfunction and 
congestive heart failure (CHF).  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_151937], the rate of cardiac dysfunction was highest when given concurrently with 
doxorubicin, with a rate of NYHA class II I/IV CHF of 4% in patients receiving

17 trastuzumab with paclitaxel (D. Slamon & Leyl and-Jones, 2001). In an adjuvant study of 
carboplatin, docetaxel, and tras tuzumab (BCIRG 006), the rate of grade 3 or 4 left 
ventricular cardiac dysfunction was 0.3% and no cardiac deaths were observed (D. 
Slamon, Eiermann, Robert, & Al., 2006). 
Other reported adverse events  include infusion reactions, characterized by [CONTACT_411], chills, 
nausea, vomiting, headache, dyspnea, hypotensi on, and rash. Trastuzumab may also 
exacerbate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.  Very rarely, trastuzumab can result in 
serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. 
2.4.[ADDRESS_174922] Cancer 
The HER2/ neu oncogene lies on chromosome 17q, and encodes a transmembrane 
glycoprotein (p185) with homology to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_12587]. 
Overexpression of HER2 at the genetic or prot ein level is observed in 20 to 25% of all 
breast cancers, and is primarily a consequence of gene amplification (D. J. Slamon et al., 
1987, 1989). Trastuzumab has been studied as first-line ther apy for metastatic breast cancer. In a study 
of [ADDRESS_174923] cancer, a response rate  of 26% was observed with single agent 
trastuzumab (Vogel, 2002). Trastuzumab has al so been used in co mbination with other 
chemotherapy to treat women wi th metastatic breast cancer. In  a phase III clinical trial, 
patients with HER2-positive metastatic br east cancer were randomized to receive 
treatment with either chemotherapy, or chem otherapy and trastuzuma b given concurrently 
(Slamon et al., 2001). A subsequent analysis of this phase III study has demonstrated that 
initial therapy with trastuzumab and chemothe rapy, as opposed to chemotherapy alone, is 
associated with both higher response rates, as well as improved time-to-progression and, 
most significantly, improved overall survival. In patients who have progressed on trastuzumab,  data from one study supports the concept 
that continuation of trastuzumab beyond progression improves the efficacy of 
chemotherapy on systemic (i.e. extra-CNS) me tastases. In a study of 156 patients who had 
previously progressed on trastuzumab-based th erapy, the continuation of trastuzumab with 
capecitabine was associated with a doubling of  the response rate an d improvement in PFS 
compared to capecitabine alone (Von Mi nckwitz, Vogel, Schmidt, & Al., 2007).

18 Trastuzumab does not cross the blood-brain barrier (Pestalozzi & Brignoli, 2000) and no 
CNS responses to trastuzumab, given intr avenously, have been documented in the 
literature. The rationale for including trastuzumab is to maintain maximum disease 
control systematically (i.e. outside of the CNS). It is anticipated that the addition of 
trastuzumab to patients with HER2-positiv e breast cancer will not alter the primary 
endpoint of CNS objective response.  
2.[ADDRESS_174924] Cancer 
It is estimated that approximately 10-15% of  women with metastatic breast cancer will 
eventually develop brain metastases (Tsuka da, Fouad, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_151938], & Lane, 1983; Tsukada, 
Hurwitz, Kashi, & Al., 1983). It has been noted that several features predict an increased 
risk of CNS recurrence, including young age, African American ethnicity, HER2 
positive or ER-negative primary breast cancer, and the presence of visceral metastases (Barnholtz-Sloan et al., 2004). Our group and Da na-Farber was the first to describe an 
increased incidence in women with HER2-pos itive metastatic breas t cancer, of whom up 
to one-third will be diagnosed with brain metastases (Lin, Bellon, & Winer, 2004). More recently, a high rate of brain metastases has al so been described in patients with triple-
negative (ER, PR, and HER2-negative) tumors with an incidence of 46% (Lin et al., 
2008). Brain metastases are associated with  considerable morbidity and mortality.

aimed at palliation, and genera lly includes whole brain radi ation (WBRT), stereotactic 
radiosurgery (SRS), and/or surgical resect ion.  As systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_151939], 
CNS progression after WBRT and/or SRS is becoming a significant problem.  Currently 
there is no optimal therapy once this occu rs.  Unfortunately, very few prospective 
studies have examined the role of chemothe rapy in the treatment of brain metastases 
from breast cancer, and most studies of novel agents have excluded patients with brain 
metastases.  Developi[INVESTIGATOR_151940]. 
Recently, data suggests that anti-angiogenic therapy can be given safely to patients with 
brain metastases, and that clinical activity has been demonstrated.  Norden and colleagues reported a retrospective case series of 55 patients treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy in patients with glioma (Norden et al., 2008). Of these patients, 2.3%

19 achieved a complete response, 31.8% partia l response, 29.5% minimal response, and 
29.5% stable disease.  Vredenburgh and colleagues treated a total of 35 patients with 
recurrent glioma with irinotecan and bevaci zumab and demonstrated a 57% ORR.    
Given the postulated importance of the VE GF pathway in the pathogenesis of brain 
metastases from breast cancer, exploration of anti-angiogenesis approaches for CNS 
metastases from breast cancer is warrante d.  Nancy Lin and colleagues have conducted a 
trial of carboplatin + bevacizumab +/- trastuzumab for patient with metastatic breast cancer and brain metastases and demonstrated  a composite CNS ORR of 63% (Lin et al, 
2013).  
A pre-clinical study in mice by [CONTACT_151987] a nd colleagues found th at treating HER2-
amplified breast cancer patients with a combination of trastuzumab and anti-VEGF 
receptor-2 (VEGFR2) antibody slowed tumor growth in the brain and conferred a significant survival benefit. This benef it was postulated to be due to enhanced 
antiangiogenic effects of these two drugs reducing total and func tional microvascular 
density in the brain, resulting in more necrosis of brain lesions (Kodack et al., 2012). 
Taken together, these evidence suggest some clinical efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy 
in treating brain tumors and metastases that warrant further clinical study. 
Evidence shows that inhibiting VEGF alone  may only produce a temporary clinical 
response, but that simultaneously inhibiti ng both VEGF and MET with cabozantinib can 
achieve a more durable clinical bene fit. Though VEGF inhibitors alone are 
therapeutically effective for ma ny types of cancer, their clin ical benefit often only last 
for several weeks or months before tumor progression recurs. Precl inical studies have 
found that VEGF pathway inhibition initiall y slows tumor growth and reduces tumor 
vasculature, this is followed by a refract ory period of rapid revascularization and 
increased tumor invasiveness (Casanovas, Hi cklin, Bergers, & Hanahan, 2005; Ebos et 
al., 2009). Resistance to VEGF pathway inhibition may devel op in response to hypoxia. 
Under hypoxic conditions, hypoxi a-inducible factor 1 α is upregulated, which in turn 
increases expression of both VEGF and M ET (Kitajima, Ide, Ohtsuka, & Miyazaki, 
2008; Pennacchietti et al., 2003). These res ponses are a compensatory mechanism 
during periods of hypoxia, and result in more angiogenesis or migration away from the 
hypoxic zone. Because VEGF pathway inhibi tion can result in hypoxia, it may also 
subsequently trigger MET expression. Several studies have shown that the MET 
pathway plays an important role in development of resistance to VEGF pathway inhibition by [CONTACT_151988] (Pàez-Ribes et al., 2009; Sh ojaei et al., 2010).

20 Moreover, additional evidence demonstrates that  VEGF inhibitors such as cediranib can 
lead to increased tumor invasiveness and me tastasis and higher MET expression levels 
(di Tomaso et al., 2011). Taken together, this suggests that simultaneously targeting both 
MET and VEGF can critically disrupt angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and cancer 
progression. 
Evidence from studies suggests that cabozantinib has anti-angi ogenic (anti-VEGFR2) 
activity, CNS penetration, and activity in br east cancer, and could be efficacious in 
treatment of brain metastases from breast ca ncer.  Cabozantinib inhibits c-met, RET, 
VEGFR2/KDR, and KIT.  The safety and to lerability of cabo zantinib have been 
established in a Phase I, single-arm, dose- escalation studies in adult patients with 
advanced solid tumors, and in another Phas e Ib trial evaluating the combination of 
cabozantinib and erlotinib.  The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events 
were diarrhea (40%), fatigue (37%), anor exia (31%), nausea (29%), PPE syndrome 
(20%), increased AST (19%), and rash (18 %).  Data from a randomized discontinuation 
study in heavily pretreated patients with me tastatic breast cancer demonstrated an ORR 
of 14% and a clinical benef it rate at 12 weeks of 48%.  Additionally, there are two 
ongoing studies of cabozantinib in metastatic breast cancer, one in ER+ disease, and one 
in triple-negative breast cancer.  We have  noted two patients who likely had brain 
metastases at time of enrollment onto st udy, though it was unknown at the time, and 
noted that there was treatment effect in the brain with cabozantinib.  One of these 
patients had TNBC, and another ha d ER+, HER2- breast cancer.  
The c-Met receptor is the only high-affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth factor 
(HGF), also known as scatter factor.  Bindi ng of HGF to the c-Met extracellular ligand-
binding domain results in receptor multimer ization and phosphorylation of multiple 
tyrosine kinase residues in the intracellular po rtion of c-Met.  Activ ation of c-Met results 
in the binding and phosphorylation of adaptor proteins, such as Gab-1, Grb-2, Shc, and 
c-Cbl, and subsequent activation of signal tr ansducers such as PI3K, STATs, ERK1 and 
2, and FAK (Christensen et al., 2003; Truso lino, Bertotti, & Comoglio, 2001). c-Met and 
HGF are expressed in numerous tissues, and their expression is pr edominantly confined 
to cells of epi[INVESTIGATOR_151941], respectively (Trusolino et al., 2001). HGF and Met promote cell proliferation, motility, invasion, and stimulate tissue repair and 
tumor growth (Bottaro et al., 1991; Gherardi  & Stoker, 1990; Ma, Maulik, Christensen, 
& Salgia, 2003; Nakamura et al., 1989; St oker, Gherardi, Marion, & Gray, 1987). c-Met 
overexpression, with or without gene amplifi cation, has been reported in a variety of 
Phase II study of cabozantinib in breast cancer with brain metastases    
Version 7/ October 18, [ADDRESS_174926],  colorectal, lung, gastric, and hepatocellular carcinoma 
(Boix et al., 1994; Kuniyasu, Yasui, Yoko zaki, Kitadai, & Tahara, 1993). Elevated 
expression of c-Met has been associated w ith poor prognosis in br east cancer (Kang et 
al., 2003; Lengyel et al., 2005). Interestingl y, data suggests the HGF and c-Met are 
expressed to a greater degree in triple-neg ative and HER2-positive breast cancer (Camp, 
Rimm, & Rimm, 1999; Sheen-Chen, Liu, Eng, & Al, 2005; Toi et al., 1998; Yamashita 
et al., 1994).  
Mouse models also suggest a critical role of the c-Met pathway during the development 
of triple-negative breas t cancer.  Mice harboring mutant c-Met knock-in or mutant c-Met 
transgene under mouse mammary tumor virus pr omoter, developed breast cancers with a 
triple-negative phenotype (Graveel, DeGroot, Su, & Al, 2009; Ponzo, Lesurf, 
Petkiewicz, & Al, 2009). Additionally, a c-Met- driven pathway signature [CONTACT_152066]-negative breast cancer from  human tissue samples and correlated with 
worse patient outcome (Graveel et al., 2009; Ponzo et al., 2009). These studies suggest 
that c-Met expression an d activation is important for init iation and progres sion of triple-
negative breast cancer. C-Met has been found to frequently be coe xpressed in HER2+ breas t cancer and appears 
to contribute to resistance through sustained AKT activation. Resistance to trastuzumab 
presents a significant barrier to effective tr eatment of HER2+ breast cancer.  Loss of Met 
function, either through RNA interference-m ediate depletion or small molecular 
mediated inhibition, significantly improve s the response to trastuzumab (Shattuck, 
Miller, & Carraway, 2008). Conversely, Met activation protects the cells against 
trastuzumab.  The mechanism of resistance li kely lies in the ability of Met to drive 
EGFR-independent/ERbB3-dependent PI3K/AKT activation.   In ER-positive breast cancer ce lls, activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase by [CONTACT_151989]118 and Ser167 and estrogen-independent 
activation of ER transcriptional activity (Pl aza-Menacho, Morandi, Robertson, & Al, 
2010). Expression of RET protein is significantly associated with ER positive tumors 
and with the development of recurrent diseas e after adjuvant tamoxifen treatment, thus 
along with MET, cotargeting RET may be a po tentially important th erapeutic target in 
ER-positive and hormone-resistant breast cancers.  
Given the data suggesting the c-Met expression is increased in the triple-negative breast 
cancer, may be important in trastuzumab -resistant HER2+ breast cancer, and RET

22 inhibition may be important in hormone refractory ER+ breast cancer, cabozantinib may 
have benefit in all subtypes of breast cancer .  Moreover, data sugge sts that cabozantinib 
penetrates the blood brain barri er, and with its anti-angioge nic activity, may be critical 
for treatment of brain metastases.  We will assess the efficacy of cabozantinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer with known brain metastases.  Patients with HER2+ breast cancer will receive trastuzumab in combination with cabozantinib. 
2.7 Correlative Studies Background 
2.7.1 Evaluate c-Met and phospho-c-Met expression in FFPE tumor tissue 
Since cabozantinib inhibits MET expression, it is hypothesized that tumors in patients who 
express higher levels of c-Me t will respond more robustly to cabozantinib therapy. Testing 
c-Met and phospho-c-Met expression in prev iously collected FFPE  tumor tissue is one 
method to genotype patient tumors. Caveats to this technique are that patients’ malignant 
cells may have acquired additional mutations since these tissues were collected, and this 
sampling may not detect the heterogeneity of gene expression within  a tumor. However, 
this technique is an accessible option to profile  genetic expression, especially when paired 
with additional profiling approaches. In this study, patients will be dichotomized as to 
whether or not their tumor expresses c-Met and the association between expression and 
response to cabozantinib will be explored. 
2.7.2 Evaluate the incidence of c-Met amplification in circulating tumor cells at baseline  
Simultaneously, we will also use another approach to determin e c-Met amplification levels 
based on circulating tumor cells. These results may corroborate the c-Met and phospho-c-
Met expression studies with FFPE tumor tissu e samples. The primary advantage of this 
technique is that malignant ce lls are collected via purificati on of circulating tumor cells 
(CTCs) from whole blood, which is a far less invasive technique for malignant cell 
sampling than traditional biopsies. Interesti ngly, these CTCs are indicative of tumor 
metastases and predictive of c linical outcomes in breast cancer  patients (Cristofanilli et al., 
2004). Patients will be grouped as to whether or  not their tumor has amplified c-Met and 
the association between amplification and re sponse to cabozantinib  will be evaluated.

patients (Boucher et al., ASCO 2013). They in clude vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), placental-derived grow th factor (PlGF), soluble (s)VEGFR1, basic fibroblast 
growth factor (bFGF), and stromal-derived factor 1  (SDF1 ). In addition, we will 
measure the plasma concentration of biomarke rs that are related to cabozantinib activity: 
HGF, s-MET, s-c-KIT and sVEGFR2. Finally, we will evaluate biomarkers of tumor 
hypoxia, by [CONTACT_151990]  (CAIX) levels as well as 
biomarkers of osteoclast and osteoblast activ ity (plasma C-telopeptide and total alkaline 
phosphatase). Baseline and on treatment biomarker values will be correlated with 
patient’s response to cabozantinib therapy. 
2.7.4 Vessel density and tortuosity 
Visualization of vessel density and tortuos ity enables longitudi nal assessment of 
cabozantinib’s impact on tumor a ngiogenesis within brain tumors. 
The feasibility of this technique has been previously demonstrat ed in a prospective trial of 
lapatinib for patients with brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer (Bullitt et 
al., 2007). This study demonstrated widespr ead abnormalities in vessel shape in the brain 
at baseline, in some cases extending far beyond the visible tumors. Vessel tortuosity 
measurements enabled correct prediction of tr eatment failure earlier than other methods. 
In that small study, of the three patients who had quantitative impr ovements in vessel 
tortuosity at 2-month follow-up, each of the two patients for whom further follow up data 
were available remained on protocol-based th erapy for [ADDRESS_174929]. 
2.7.5 Cerebral blood volume, bloo d flow, and vessel size 
Vascularity of tumors indicates active angiogenesis, a pro cess that cabozantinib targets 
through its inhibitory effects on VEGFR and c-MET. Patients on this study will receive 
routine brain MRIs to assess the vascularity of their br ain tumors – blood flow, blood 
volume, permeability and surface area of capi[INVESTIGATOR_151942]. In a previous study of AZD2171,

24 a small molecule inhibitor of VEGFRs, th ese techniques successfully demonstrated 
normalization of tumor vessels and reducti on of vasogenic edema in patients with 
gliomas. Furthermore, early changes in vasc ular parameters were predictive of improved 
overall outcomes in these patien ts (Batchelor TT et al., 2007). 
2.7.6 Blood sample collection 
Blood will be collected at baseline and at  the end of treatment for cell-free DNA 
(cfDNA).  The cfDNA will be processed by [CONTACT_151991]/HCC Clinical Trials Core laboratory for future research 
purposes.  The banked samples will be used to analyze DNA, RNA and protein in future studies.

5 TREATMENT PLAN   
5.1 Treatment Overview 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatien t basis. Expected toxicities and potential 
risks as well as dose modifications for cabo zantinib are described in Section 6 (Expected 
Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modificat ion). No investigational or commercial 
agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_151944] d below may be administ ered with the intent 
to treat the participant’s malignancy. The target accrual is up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_174968] “asse ssable” CNS disease. 
Assessable disease is defined as at least one parenchymal brain lesion that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest dimension ≥ 10 mm by 
[CONTACT_151995] (measureable non- CNS disease is not required for study 
participation). The estimated rate of accrua l is 1-[ADDRESS_174969]. Exelixis will provide each investigator w ith adequate supplies of cabozantinib, which 
will be supplied as 60-mg, and 20-mg yellow film-coated tablets. The 60-mg tablets are 
oval, and the 20-mg tablets are round.  
Subjects will receive cabozantinib orally ad ministered daily and continuously. Dosing 
will begin at 60 mg cabozantinib per day ta ken orally for all patients with dosing 
delays/dose modifications as  outlined in Section 6.  
A full cycle length will be defined as 21 days  (3 weeks). Cabozantinib will be given on 
day 1 and taken daily for 21 day cycle. Patients with HER2 positive disease will 
concurrently receive 6 mg/kg intravenous trastuzumab on Day 1 of each cycle. HER2 positive patients naïve to trastuzumab receive an 8 mg/kg loading dose during cycle 1, and resume the 6 mg/kg dosing for every subsequent cycle.  Correlative imaging studies

prior to patient receiving Cycle [ADDRESS_174971] dose of  cabozantinib. Starting 
with cycle 2, minor deviations to the treatment schedule are allowed for patient 
scheduling requests with a + 4 days window (i.e. infusion chair availability, weather-
related issues, vacation, etc.). Additionally, minor deviations to  the scan schedule will be 
allowed (i.e. Day [ADDRESS_174972], MUGA) for patient scheduling requests with a + 7 
days window. 
Subjects will be provided with a sufficient supply of cabozantinib and instructions for 
taking the cabozantinib on days without scheduled clinic visits. After fasting (with 
exception of water) for 2 hours, participants  will take cabozantinib daily each morning 
with a full glass of water (minimum of 8 oz/ 240 mL) and continue to fast for [ADDRESS_174973] dosing time and doses taken in a study drug dosing diary while on cabozantinib. If doses are withheld, the or iginal schedule of assessments  should be maintained when 
cabozantinib is restarted. The participant shoul d be instructed to not make up the missed 
doses and to maintain the planned dosing schedule. As described in Appendix D, 
Participant’s Medication Diary, if it has b een more than [ADDRESS_174974] be instructed to not make up missed doses that are vomited. 
Participants should be instructed to wait unt il the next day to take  the next scheduled 
dose and should be reminded to tell their doctor or nurse at their next  visit which dose(s) 
were missed. 
At study sites, all study medication will be stor ed as described in the local institution’s 
pharmacy policies (or SOPs) and inventoried in accordance with applicable state and 
federal regulations.

5.4.1 Cabozantinib  
Subjects will receive cabozantinib orally ad ministered daily and continuously. Dosing 
will begin at 60 mg cabozantinib per day ta ken orally for all patients with dosing 
delays/dose modifications as  outlined in Section 6.  
Participants will be provided with a sufficien t supply of cabozantinib and instructions 
for taking the cabozantinib on days without  scheduled visits. After fasting (with 
exception of water) for 2 hours, participants  will take cabozantinib daily each morning

39 and doses taken in a study drug dosing di ary while on cabozantinib. If doses are 
withheld, the original schedul e of assessments should be ma intained when cabozantinib 
is restarted. The participant s hould be instructed to not make up the missed doses and to 
maintain the planned dosing schedule. As described in Appendix D, Participant’s 
Medication Diary, if it has been more than [ADDRESS_174980] be instructed to not  make up missed doses that are vomited. 
Participants should be instructed to wait unt il the next day to take  the next scheduled 
dose and should be reminded to tell their doctor or nurse at their next  visit which dose(s) 
were missed. 
5.4.2 Trastuzumab  
For HER2-positive patients, trastuzumab is ad ministered intravenously in the outpatient 
setting. The dose for initial treatment with tr astuzumab is 8 mg/kg IV unless the patient 
has received qweek dose (2mg/kg) trastuzumab ≤ 21 days or q3 week dose (6mg/kg) ≤ 
42 days from day 1 of treatment; patients w ho have received trastuzumab within these 
windows of initiation of therapy should rece ive an initial dose of 6 mg/kg IV. All 
subsequent doses are 6 mg/kg IV. There s hould be no dose adjustment for trastuzumab. 
Trastuzumab is administered concurrently wi th cabozantinib on Day [ADDRESS_174981] not previously received trastuzumab, the initial infusion time of 
trastuzumab (loading dose 8 mg/kg) is approximately [ADDRESS_174982] dose is well tolerated, subsequent infusion times may be shortened to approximately 30 minutes or given per participating site’s institutional SOP for trastuzumab administration.

40  Chemotherapy 
 Radiopharmaceuticals 
 Steroids (not including physio logical replacement doses of  steroids, equivalent to 
≤ 10 mg/day prednisone, or megestrol acetate used to treat constitutional 
symptoms) 
 Endocrine therapy for breast cancer (e g, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors) 
 Radiation therapy 
If the participant must use other concomitant medications  during the study (including 
vitamins, herbal and nutritional supplements, and over-the-counter medications), it is the 
responsibility of the principa l investigator (PI) to ensure  that details regarding the 
medication are documented. 
At the discretion of the investigator and after the onset of symptoms, treatment (or 
prophylaxis) with anti-emetic and anti-diar rheal medications may be undertaken per 
standard clinical practice.  
Treatment with denosumab or a bisphosphonate  is allowed while patient is on study. 
Colony stimulating factors (eg, erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, 
and peg-filgrastim) are not allo wed while patient is on study.  
Pain medications, transfusions, short-term  systemic steroid treatment, and other 
supportive measures should be utilized as dictated by [CONTACT_151997].  
No concurrent investigational agents are permitted. 
5.6 Potential Drug Interactions 5.6.1 Cytochrome P450  
Data from a clinical drug interaction study (Study XL184 008) sh ow that clinically 
relevant steady state concentrations of cabozan tinib appear to have no marked effect on 
the area under the plasma drug concentrati on time curve (AUC) of co administered 
rosiglitazone, a CYP2C8 substrat e. Therefore, cabozantinib is  not anticipated to markedly 
inhibit CYP2C8 in the clinic, an d by [CONTACT_151998], is not anticipated to markedly inhibit other 
Phase II study of cabozantinib in breast cancer with brain metastases    
Version 7/ October 18, [ADDRESS_174984] lower [I]/Ki va lues compared with CYP2C8 (ie, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A 2, and CYP3A4). In vitro data indicate that cabozantinib is 
unlikely to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, excep t for possible induction of CYP1A1 at 
high cabozantinib concentrations (30 μM).  
Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate and a weak substrate for CYP2C9 (but not a 
CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CY P2B6, or CYP1A2 substrate) , based on data from in 
vitro studies. Results from a clinical pharmacology study,  XL184 006, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib wi th the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, 
resulted in an approximately 77% reduction in cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after 
a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Chronic co-administration of 
cabozantinib with strong indu cers of the CYP3A4 family (e g, dexamethasone, phenytoin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin e, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) may 
significantly decrease cabozantinib concentra tions. The chronic us e of strong CYP3A4 
inducers should be avoided. Other drugs that induce CYP3A4 should be used with caution 
because these drugs have the potential to decrease exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib. 
Selection of alternate concomitant medicati ons with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme 
induction potential is recommended.  
Results from a clinical pharmacology st udy, XL184 007, showed that concurrent 
administration of cabozantinib w ith the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted 
in a 38% increase in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of 
cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Co-adm inistration of cabozantinib with strong 
inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, 
indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir) may increase cabozantinib concentrations. Grapefruit and Seville oranges may also increase plasma co ncentrations of cabozantinib 
and should be avoided. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors  should be avoided and other drugs that 
inhibit CYP3A4 should be used  with caution because these drugs have the potential to 
increase exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib. Sel ection of alternate concomitant medications 
with no or minimal CYP3 A4 enzyme inhibition po tential is recommended.  
In addition, cimetidine should be avoided because of its potential to interfere with CYP3A4 mediated meta bolism of cabozantinib. 
Please refer to the drug interaction tables at the following webs ites for lists of substrates, 
inducers, and inhibitors of sele cted CYP450 isozyme pathways:

5.6.2 Drugs Associated with QTc Prolongation  
Treatment with cabozantinib has been associ ated with a mild pr olongation of the QTc 
interval.  Caution should be used when treati ng subjects on cabozantinib with other drugs 
associated with QTc prolongation (see http://www.qtdrugs.org ).  Additional QTc 
monitoring is suggested for subjects who are treated concomitantly with QTc prolonging 
drugs.  
5.6.3 Protein Binding 
Cabozantinib is highly bound (≥  99.7%) to human plasma pr oteins. Therefore, highly 
protein bound drugs should be used with ca ution with cabozantinib because there is a 
potential displacement  interaction that could incr ease free concen trations of 
cabozantinib and/or a co-administere d highly protein bound drug (and a 
corresponding increase in pharmacologic effect). 5.6.4 Other Interactions  
Food may increase exposure levels of cabo zantinib by 57%, fasting recommendations 
should be followed. In vitro data suggest that  cabozantinib is unlikely to be a substrate 
for P glycoprotein, but it does appear to have the potential to inhi bit the P-glycoprotein 
transport activity. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the potential to increase plasma 
concentrations of co-administered substrat es of P-glycoprotein. Additional details 
related to these overall conclusions can be found in the investigator brochure. 
 Additional details regarding potential drug interactions with cabozantinib can be found 
in the investigator brochure.

6 EXPECTED TOXICITIES AND DOSI NG DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
DUE TO CABOZANTINIB 
Dose delays and modifications will be made using the following recommendations. 
Toxicity assessments will be done using the CTCAE Version 4.0 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC AE) which is identified and located on 
the CTEP website at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electroni c_applications/ctc.htm . 
  If possible, symptoms should be managed symptomatically. In the case of toxicity, 
appropriate medical treatment should be used (including anti-emetics, anti-diarrheals, etc.). All adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_152000], through th e study and until the final study visit. Participants 
continuing to experience toxicity at the off study visit may be contact[CONTACT_143027].  
6.1 Anticipated Toxicities 
The general adverse event profile of cabo zantinib includes GI symptoms (such as 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), fatigue, anor exia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
(PPE) syndrome, skin rash, elevated ALT and AST, increased pancreatic enzymes with rare cases of  pancreatitis, as well as side effects associated with  inhibition of VEGF 
signaling such as thrombotic events (eg, pulmonary embolism [PE] and deep vein 
thrombosis [DVT]), hypertension, proteinuria,  hemorrhagic events, and rare cases of 
gastrointestinal [GI] perforation and rectal/perirectal abscess. Arterial thromboembolism (transient ischemic attack [TIA], myocardial  infarction [MI]) have been reported rarely.

related to cabozantinib or st udy procedures, even if the SAE occurs more than [ADDRESS_174992] dose of cabozantinib.  Subjects will be instructed to notify thei r physician immediately of any and all AEs.
 
Subjects experiencing one or more AEs due to the cabozantinib may require a dosing delay 
or reduction(s) in their dose in order to continue with cabozantinib.   
Re-escalating cabozantinib after a dose reduction: 
 
 Subjects who required a dose reduction for Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity should not be re-escalated 
 For other related AEs, subjects may be re -escalated to the previous dose at the 
discretion of the investigator but not sooner than 2 weeks beyond the resolution 
to Grade ≤  1 or to the base line value of AEs. 
 If a subject has been dose-re duced , dose re-escalation can  only occur to the next 
higher dose level. Further dose escalation to higher well-tolerated dose levels is 
allowed only if clinically indicated per investigator’s judgment and dose escalation criteria are met w ith each escalation (e.g. a minimum 2 week interval 
between escalations)  
 If the AEs that previously  led to dose reduction(s) recur upon re-es calation, the 
dose should be reduced again and no furt her dose escalation will be permitted.  
 
Dose re-escalation is not allowed for dose reduction triggered by [CONTACT_152001].  
Additional information for dose delays or dose reductions: 
 Dose delays for reason(s) other than AEs related to cabozantinib, such as 
surgical procedures with no anticancer therapy intent, may be allowed with 
investigator approval. The acceptable length of interruption will be determined 
by [CONTACT_093].

47 In the absence of an unacceptable cabozantinib- related toxicity and/or clinical signs of 
disease progression, subjects may continue treatment at the di scretion of the investigator. 
Subjects must be instructed to notify their phys ician immediately for any and all toxicities. 
Guidelines for the management of AEs (ie,  dose interruptions a nd dose reductions) are 
presented in the next sections. Each dose reduction of cabozantinib  should be to one 
dose level lower that the current dose (see Ta ble 4 below).  Dose reductions of more 
than one dose level are acceptabl e if agreed to by [CONTACT_57748]. If cabozantinib of 
cabozantinib is restarted after being withheld or interru pted, the subject should be 
instructed not to make up the missed doses of cabozantinib.  
The reason for treatment delay and reduced dose must be recorded on the case report form 
(CRF). 
Dosing may need to be interrupted for AEs cons idered not related to cabozantinib if this 
is clinically indicated or if causality is initially uncertain. Cabozantinib may be resumed 
at the same dose (or a lower dos e per investigator judgment) if the AE is determined not 
to be related to cabozantinib once the inve stigator determines that retreatment is 
clinically appropriate and the subject meets the protoc ol re-treatment criteria.

6.3.1 General Guidelines for Non-Hematologic and Hematologic Adverse Events  
Guidelines for the management of AEs (ie,  dose interruptions a nd dose reductions) are 
presented in the next sections. Each dose reduction of cabozantinib  should be to one 
dose level lower that the current dose. Dose reductions of more than one dose level are 
acceptable if agreed to by [CONTACT_148606]. All AEs should also be managed with 
supportive care at the earliest signs of toxicity  considered related to  the study treatment.  
If study treatment of cabozantinib is restarte d after being withheld or interrupted, the 
subject should be instructed not to ma ke up the missed doses of cabozantinib. The 
Phase II study of cabozantinib in breast cancer with brain metastases    
Version 7/ October 18, [ADDRESS_174994] be recorded on the case report form 
(CRF). 
Dosing may need to be interrupted for AEs cons idered not related to cabozantinib if this 
is clinically indicated or if causality is  initially uncertain. Study treatment may be 
resumed at the same dose (or a lower dose pe r investigator judgment) if the AE is 
determined not to be related to cabozantinib once the investigator determines that 
retreatment is clinically appropriate and th e subject meets the protocol re-treatment 
criteria. 
Subjects receiving a daily dose of 20 mg may be restarted at the same dose if deemed 
safe at the discretion of the investigator. S ubjects unable to tolera te a daily dose of 20 
mg should discontinue study treatment. Re-escalation to the previous dose, (but not  higher than 60 mg/day) may be allowed at 
the discretion of the inves tigator but no sooner than 2 weeks beyond resolution of AEs 
that led to the dose re duction. Dose re-escalation is not allowed for a drug-related dose 
reduction triggered by [CONTACT_152002] 4 AEs affecting major organs (eg, 
central nervous system, cardiac, hepatic, renal). 
The predicted effective plasma half-life of cabozantinib is [ADDRESS_174995] subjects 2 to 3 weeks to reach 
steady state. If AEs attributable  to cabozantinib occur within the initial 3-week period of 
dosing, early intervention with dose modifica tions may be justified for AEs that, if 
worsened, could potentially be dangerous or debilitating, because without a dose 
adjustment, systemic exposure of cabozantinib  might be expected to increase after the 
onset of the AE.

Administration of antidiarrheal/antimotility agen ts is recommended at  the first sign of

more than one antidiarrheal agent. When th erapy with antidiarrheal agents does not 
control the diarrhea to tolerable levels, study treatment should be temporarily interrupted or dose reduced. 
In addition, general supportive measures should  be implemented includ ing continuous oral 
hydration, correction of fluid and electrolyt e abnormalities, small frequent meals, and 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151947]-containing products, high fat meals, and alcohol.  Nausea and Vomiting 
Antiemetic agents are recommended as clinically  appropriate at the first sign of nausea 
and vomiting or as prophylaxis to prevent emesis, along with supportive care in 
accordance to clinical practice guideline s. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are 
recommended over chronic use of NK-1 recep tor antagonists and dexamethasone (NK-1 
receptor antagonists can induce or inhibit CY P3A4, and glucocorticoids induce CYP3A4 
and thus could lower cabozantinib exposure). Caution is also recommended with the use 
of nabilone, which is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. When therapy with antiemetic agents 
does not control the nausea or vomiting to tolerable levels, study treatment should be 
temporarily interrupted or dose reduced. 
Stomatitis and Mucositis 
Preventive measures include a comprehensive dental examination to identify any potential 
complications before study treatment is in itiated. Removal of local factors should be

Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrom e (also known as hand-foot syndrome), skin 
rash (including blisters, erythematous ras h, macular rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis 
acneiform, and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, and erythema have been reported in 
cabozantinib-treated subjects. All subject s on study should be advised on prophylactic 
skin care. This includes the use of hypoallerg enic moisturizing creams, ointment for dry 
skin, and sunscreen with sun protection factor ≥  30, avoidance of exposure of hands and 
feet to hot water, protection of pressure-sen sitive areas of hands and feet, and use of 
thick cotton gloves and socks to  prevent injury and to k eep the palms and soles dry. 
Subjects with skin disorders should be careful ly monitored for signs of infection (eg, 
abscess, cellulitis, or impetigo). 
Early signs of hand-foot syndrome could be  tingling, numbness, and slight redness or 
mild hyperkeratosis. Early manifestations in clude painful, symmetr ical red and swollen

57 areas on the palms and soles. The lateral sides of the fingers or peri-ungual zones may 
also be affected. Adequate interventions are required to preven t worsening of skin 
symptoms such as blisters, desquamations, ul cerations, or necrosis of affected areas. 
Aggressive management of symptoms is  recommended, including early dermatology 
referral. Treatment guidelines for PPE relate d to study treatment are presented in Table 
10. 
In the case of study treatment-related skin changes (eg, rash, hand-foot syndrome), the 
investigator may request that  additional assessments be conducted with the subject’s 
consent. These assessments may include digita l photographs of the skin changes and/or 
a biopsy of the affected skin and may be repeated until the skin changes resolve.

Subjects who develop a PE or DVT should have cabozantinib treatment held until 
therapeutic anticoagulation with heparins (eg, low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]) 
is established. (Note: Therapeu tic anticoagulation with oral anticoagulants, eg, warfarin, 
or oral platelet inhibitors su ch as clopi[INVESTIGATOR_151948]). Cabozantinib 
treatment may be resumed in subjects who ar e stable and have uncomplicated PE or 
DVT and are deriving clinical benefit from cabozantinib treatment. During 
anticoagulation treatment, subjects need to be monitored on an ongoing basis for 
bleeding risk and signs of bleeding which may require a dditional or more frequent 
laboratory tests in accordance to instituti onal guidelines. If there are any signs of 
clinically significant bleedings, cabozan tinib treatment should be permanently 
discontinued. 
Arterial thrombotic events (eg, transient is chemic attack, myocardial infarction) have 
been observed in studies with cabozantinib. Su bjects should be evaluated for preexisting 
risk factors for arterial thrombotic events  such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], 
hypertension, coronary artery disease, history of tobacco use, and cardiac or 
thromboembolic events that occurred before initiation of study treatment. Cabozantinib 
treatment should be discontinued in subjects who develop an acute myocardial infarction 
or any other clinically relevant arterial thromboembolic complication.

6.3.15  Thyroid Function Disorders  
Changes in thyroid function tests (TFTs) an d hypothyroidism have been reported with 
cabozantinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment as a result of altered thyroid 
hormone regulation by [CONTACT_152010] (Torino et al. 
2009). Preliminary data from ongoing studies indicate that treatment-emergent elevation 
of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) by [CONTACT_152011]-dependent in fashion. 
Hyperthyroidism has also been reported. Currently available data are insufficient to determine the mechanism of TFT alterations and its clinical relevance. Routine monitoring 
of thyroid function and assess ments for signs and symptoms associated with thyroid 
dysfunction is recommended before initiati on and during treatment with cabozantinib. 
Management of thyroid dysfunction (eg, symptomatic hypothyroidism) should follow accepted clinical practice guidelines and dose modification guidelines.  
6.3.16  Guidelines for Prevention of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ ) has been reported with us e of anti-angiogenic drugs and 
bisphosphonates and denosumab in cancer patie nts. Additional risk factors for ONJ have 
been identified such as use of corticosteroids, chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, smoking, dental or orofacial surgery procedures, and cancer disease itself. Osteonecrosis has been reported among subject s treated with cabozan tinib, the details of 
which are provided in the current version of  Investigator’s Brochure. As a preventive 
measure, invasive dental procedures should be avoided if possible in subjects who have previously been treated with or concomita ntly receive bisphosphonates or denosumab. 
In cases where dental procedures are unavoidable, the risks and benefits of a dental procedure and the extent of the procedure as well  as the risk of develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_151951] a temporary treatment interruption of

QTc interval was evaluated in a randomi zed, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase [ADDRESS_175038] form 
morphology or new rhythms were not observed. Accordingly, subjects in this study will 
be monitored for potential QT effects. 
Other factors which may contri bute to QTc prolongation include: 
 Treatment with other drugs associated with QTc prolongation (see 
http://www.qtdrugs.org); 
 Treatment with CyP 3A4 inhibitors (which may increase cabozantinib drug 
levels); 
 Electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia); 
 Medical conditions which can alter electro lyte status eg, severe or prolonged 
diarrhea. 
Subjects having any of these additional risk  factors while on cabozantinib must have 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) performed approxima tely one week after the onset of these 
factors. 
If at any time on study there is an increase in QTc to an absolute value > 500 msec, two 
additional ECGs should be performed within  30 minutes after th e initial ECG with 
intervals not less than 3 minut es apart. If the average QTc calculated by [CONTACT_152012] (QTcF) from the three ECGs is > [ADDRESS_175039] be withheld

 If possible, discontinue any QTc- prolonging concomitant medications; 
 Repeat ECG triplets hourly until the average QTcF is ≤ [ADDRESS_175040]. 
The Sponsor should be notified immedi ately of any QTc prolongation event: 
Subjects with QTc prolongation and symptoms must be monitored closely until the QTc 
elevation has resolved. Cardiology consul tation is recommended for evaluation and 
subject management. Symptomatic subjects must  be treated in accordance with standard 
clinical practice. No additional study treatment is to be given to the subject until after the event has resolved, the subject has been thoroughly evaluated, and further treatment has been agreed to by [CONTACT_1034]. If any a dditional study treatment is given (eg, after 
correction of electrolyte abnormalities and normalization of QTcF), it will be at a reduced dose as agreed to by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator and the Sponsor.

nausea, vomiting, pain, rigors, headache, c ough, dizziness, rash, and asthenia. These 
symptoms are usually mild to moderate in severity, a nd occur infrequently with 
subsequent trastuzumab infusion. Thes e symptoms can be treated with an 
analgesic/antipyretic such as meperidine, or  an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. 
Serious adverse reactions to trastuzumab infusion including dyspnea, hypotension, 
wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycar dia, reduced oxygen saturation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_151952]. In rare cases, these events were associ ated with a clinical 
course culminating in a fatal outcome. Serious reactions have been treated with supportive 
therapy such as oxygen, beta-agonists, corticos teroids, and withdrawal of trastuzumab as 
indicated. If patients develop an infusion reaction: 
 Stop trastuzumab infusion and notify physician. 
 Assess vital signs.

FFPE tissue sections will be deparaffinized prior to antigen retrieval, blocking, and 
incubation with primary antibodies. Patients wi ll be dichotomized as to whether or not 
their tumor expresses c-Met and the association between expression and response to 
cabozantinib will be evaluated. 
 Please refer to Appendix F for archival tissue guidelines. 
 
9.2 Evaluate the incidence of c-Met positi ve circulating tumor cells at baseline 
Peripheral blood will be collected at baseline  for evaluation of c-met amplification in 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Two tubes of  whole blood will be co llected in CellSave 
tubes.  CTCs will be collected using the automated CellSearch processing technique 
(Veridex).  The captured cells are permeabilized and labeled with cytokeratin CD45

Stained cells are collected by [CONTACT_152014] a “MagNest” cartridge. This 
cartridge is automatically scanned. Semi-aut omated counting is performed according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions by a trai ned pathologist. The MET/CEP 7 bacterial 
artificial chromosome (BAC) probe will be obtained from Vysis Molecular (Abbot Park, 
Illinois). BAC MET (RP11-95I20) will be obtained from CHORI (Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151955]). Labeling will be completed with the Nick Translation 
Kit (Vysis Molecular (Abbot Park, Illinois). Slides will be maintained in a horizontal 
position throughout the entire hybrid ization and washing proce dure.  Briefly, cells are 
fixed with methanol-acetic acid  (3:1), dehydrated in an al cohol series (50%, 75%, 90%, 
100%) and air-dried. Five microliters of the pr obe mixture are applied, and the slides are 
covered with cover glass and sealed with rubber cement. Pre-hybridization is done with 
hybridization buffer without dextran sulfate for 1 hour at 37 oC. Denaturation is 
performed at 94
oC for 5 minutes. Hybridization is completed overnight at 37oC. 
Following hybridization, slides are washed in 1x SSC 3 times for 10 minutes each at 
37oC (maintaining the horizontal position), br iefly air dried, and counterstained with 
Vectashield/DAPI (Vector). Two-color FISH  slides will be created for each MET 
amplification analysis. Manual quantification of tumor cells will be performed by [CONTACT_152015] (DAPI-positive signals).  This will be performed in [CONTACT_152069]’s laborat ory at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.  
Patients will be grouped as to whether or not their tumor has amplified Met and the association between amplific ation and response to cabozantinib will be evaluated.

dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI; and T2-based, termed dynamic susceptibility 
contrast (DSC) MRI. There are limitations to DCE-MRI, because enhancement depends 
on multiple factors (blood flow, blood volume, permeability and surface area of the 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_99996]). It is therefore important to measure both blood flow  and blood volume.  
The following measurements will be described at baseline and following the first cycle of 
cabozantinib (on Cycle 2 Day 1). These an alyses are exploratory and hypothesis-
generating only. Any promising findings will be further studied in future clinical trials. 
 Perfusion MRI Markers 
We will quantitatively describe relative cerebral blood volume/flow (rCBS, rCBF), mean transit time (MTT), and mean vessel diameter from perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) and arterial spin labeling.

 Diffusion 
We will measure the full water self-diffu sion tensor on a voxe l-by-voxel basis. 
Water mobility can regionally increase due to tissue edema, increased matrix 
degradation caused by [CONTACT_152020], and/or  tumor necrosis. We will also 
measure tensor fractional anisotropy (FA); FA can be used to define white matter 
tract directions, and tumor invasion may induce effects like displacement, 
infiltration, or disruptio n of white matter tracts. 
 Resting State (optional) 
We will measure the default mode connec tivity using functiona l MRI to assess the 
infiltration, or disruptio n of white matter tracts.

74 Analgesic medications will be recorded on a daily participant diary matching the dates 
of the pain questionnaire (described above). Analgesic medications to be recorded on the 
diary include narcotics and corticosteroids used to trea t pain symptoms.  Every effort 
should be made to collect responses for ever y day during the 7 day assessment interval.  
However, collection of a minimum of 4 out of  the 7 days in the interval (need not be 
consecutive) will be deemed sufficient for assessment completion. 
The pain questionnaire and analgesic medication diary will be due on  the last 
week of the cycles that patients are scanned on ( ie end of cycle 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, etc.) until the date 
of the participant’s last follow-up visit . The first pain questionnaire completed can be used 
to report pain that the participant experienced th e week prior to the date of the study consent 
signature.   
9.6 Tumor biopsies With agreement of the investigator and w ith the participant’s consent tumor tissue 
samples may be optionally collected, pref erentially, during the screening period 
(preferably 1-2 weeks prior to initi ation of cabozantin ib treatment).  
Please refer to Appendix F  for specimen collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_15381]. 
 
Tumor analyses may involve evaluation of the signaling pathways related to 
cabozantinib targets (eg, VEGF R, MET, KIT, RET) and include methods such as 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], fluorescence in situ hybridizati on (FISH) and/or Immuno-histochemistry 
(IHC). Mutation and/or amplification status  of disease-specific tumor-promoters or 
suppressors may also be determined to char acterize the potential impact on response or 
resistance to cabozantinib (eg, HER2, EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PTEN, PIK3CA,

Version 7/ October 18, [ADDRESS_175064] 1.1. Volumetric assessments of 
CNS response will also be conducted. Re sponse and progression in non-CNS sites 
will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_86048] (RECIST) Committee (Therasse, 
2000). Changes in only the largest diameter  (unidimensional measurement) of the 
tumor lesions are used in the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_175065] their response clas sified according to th e definitions stated 
below. (Note: Participants who exhibit objective disease progression or die prior to 
the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) All participants who receive at least one dose of cabozantinib will be cons idered in the denominator for calculation 
of objective response rate.

accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter  >20 millimeters

Version 7/ October 18, [ADDRESS_175068] ed in millimeters (or decima l fractions of centimeters). 
A lesion in a previously irradiated area is not eligible fo r measurable disease 
unless there is ob jective evidence of progression of the lesion prior to study 
enrollment. Lesions in previously irradiated areas must be clearly identified as 
such . 
Clinical lesions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  
Malignant lymph nodes.  
To be considered pathologically enlarged  and measurable, a ly mph node must be > 
[ADDRESS_175069] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no great er than 5 mm). At baselin e and in follow-up, only the 
short axis will be m easured and followed. 
Non-measurable disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with > 10 to < 15mm short axis, are considered non-
measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pul monis, inflammatory breast  disease, a bdominal masses 
identified by [CONTACT_152022], 
and cystic lesions are all considered non-measurable. 
Target lesions.  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_175070] a short axis > 15 mm. The short axis should be included 
in the sum of the lesions in the calculation of  response. Nodes that shrink to < 10 mm 
are considered normal. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest diameter) a nd their suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements (either by [CONTACT_152023]).  For CNS and non-CNS 
sites, the sum of the longest diameter (LD)  for all target lesions will be calculated

Methods of Evaluation for CNS Measurable Disease 
MRI Brain: Imaging with MRI brain is re quired for all participants on study to 
evaluate brain lesions. MRI images will  include T1-weighted images with and 
without gadolinium contrast, T2-weighted images, and FLAIR (fluid attenuated 
inversion recovery) images. 
 
Methods of Evaluation for Non-CNS Measurable Disease 
Clinical lesions. Measurable skin lesions  will be documented by [CONTACT_152024], 
including use of a ruler to es timate the size of the lesion. 
Chest x-ray. Lesions on chest x-ray are accep table as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surr ounded by [CONTACT_6776]; howe ver, CT is preferable. 
Conventional CT and MRI. Th ese techniques should be perfo rmed with cuts of [ADDRESS_175074], abdomen, and 
pelvis. Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific 
protocols. 
Ultrasound (US). When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response 
evaluation, US should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a 
possible alternative to clini cal measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, 
subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the 
complete disappearance of superficial lesion s usually assessed  by [CONTACT_15077]. FDG PET and PET/CT. The acquisition of FDG PET and FDG PET/CT scans should 
follow the NCI Guidelines for using FDG PET as an indicator of therapeutic response 
(Shankar et al., 2006). Patients should avoi d strenuous exercise and be on a low 
carbohydrate diet for [ADDRESS_175075] a serum glucose of less than 200 
mg/dL at the time of FDG injection. A 10-[ADDRESS_175076] cancer with brain metastases

84 should be paid to ensure consistent patie nt preparation and ac quisition parameters 
between the follow-up scan and the baseline scan.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy. The utilization of  these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific 
context require sophisticated e quipment and a high level of expertise that may only be 
available in some centers. Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective 
tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in reference centers. 
However, such techniques may be useful to  confirm complete pathological response 
when biopsies are obtained . 
Tumor markers. Tumor markers alone cann ot be used to as sess response.  
11.4 Response Criteria 
11.4.1 Response Criteria for Target Lesions (RECIST 1.1) 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of al l target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decreas e in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% incr ease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest su m on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study).  In addition to  the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as refe rence the smallest sum diameters while on 
study. 
 
11.4.2 Response Criteria for Non-Target Lesions (RECIST 1.1) 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of al l non-target lesions a nd normalization of 
tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in  size (<10 mm short 
axis).

CONFIDENTIAL 
This document is confidentia l. Do not disclose or use except as authorized. 
85 Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper norma l limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more  non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion stat us.  It must be representati ve of overall disease status 
change, not a single lesion increase.      Although a clear progressi on of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_151956], and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Prin cipal Investigator). 
 
11.4.3 Evaluation of New Lesions 
 
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal  (i.e. not due to difference in scanning 
technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to repr esent something other than 
tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions  may be simply healing or flare of pre-
existing lesions). However, a lesion identif ied on a follow-up scan in an anatomical 
location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a 
new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow-up evalua tion will clarify if it 
truly represents new disease and if PD is  confirmed, progression should be declared 
using the date of the initial scan  on which the lesion was discovered. 
 
11.4.4 CNS Volumetric & Composite Response Criteria 
 
RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used to de termine response but volumetric/composite 
response will also be done as an exploratory study. 
CNS Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be satisfied: 
 Complete resolution of all measurable (≥  1 cm diameter) and non-measurable 
brain metastases 
 No new CNS lesions (n ew lesion defined as ≥  6 mm diameter) 
 Stable or decreasing steroid dose 
 No new/progressive tumor-related neurologic signs or symptoms

86  No progression of systemic (non-CNS)  disease as assessed by [CONTACT_152025] (PR): All of the following must be satisfied: 
 ≥ 50% reduction in the volumetric sum of all measurable ( ≥ 1 cm diameter) brain 
metastases compared to baseline 
 No progression of non-measurable lesions 
 No new lesions (new lesion defined as ≥ 6 mm) 
 Stable or decreasing steroid dose 
 No new/progressive tumor-related neurologic signs or symptoms 
 No progression of systemic (non-CNS)  disease as assessed by [CONTACT_152026] (SD): All of the following must be satisfied: 
 < 50% reduction in the volumetric sum of all measurable ( ≥ 1 cm diameter) brain 
metastases compared to baseline, and not fulfilling the criteria for progressive 
disease 
 No progression of non-measurable lesions 
 No new lesions (new lesion defined as ≥ 6 mm) 
 Stable or decreasing steroid dose 
 No new/progressive tumor-related neurologic signs or symptoms 
 No progression of systemic (non-CNS)  disease as assessed by [CONTACT_152027]: CNS lesions were initially evaluable ( ≥ 1 cm diameter) at baseline and have 
decreased in size on trial therapy to < 1 cm  diameter will continue to be assessed 
volumetrically for response. 
CNS Progression (PD): Patients will be considered to have PD if ANY of the following 
are satisfied: 
 ≥40% increase in the volumetric sum of a ll measurable lesions as compared to 
the smallest volume since protocol -based therapy was initiated, OR 
 Progression of non-measur able lesions*, OR 
 New lesions (new lesion defined as ≥ 6 mm), OR 
 Increasing steroid requirement (As CNS progr ession is an eligibility requirement, 
increasing steroid dose within 4 weeks after study entry will not necessarily constitute disease progression), OR 
 New/progression tumor-related neurologic signs and symptoms (NSS) except for 
transient worsening lasting ≤ 14 days. (As CNS progres sion is an eligibility

necessarily constitute disease progression), OR 
 Progression of systemic (non-CNS)  disease as assessed by [CONTACT_393] 
*Note: Progression of non-measurable ( non-target) CNS lesions is defined as 
follows: 
 A lesion initially at baseline ≤  5 mm in diameter that increases to ≥ 10 mm in 
diameter, or 
 A lesion initially at baseline 6-[ADDRESS_175077] 5 
mm in diameter. 
These criteria were chosen to minimize cl assifying subjects as  having progressive 
disease due to MRI sampling error, gi ven an MRI slice thickness of 3 mm.

Note:   Participants with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
"symptomatic deterioration". Every effort should be made to document the objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment. 
 
11.4.6 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall re sponse: The duration of  overall response is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR  (whichever is first recorded) until the 
first date that recurrence or  PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD 
the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. 
 Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent 
disease is objectively documented.

89 Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is  measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taki ng as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started. 
 
11.4.7 Progression-Free Survival 
 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of  time from start of treatment to 
time of objective disease progression or tim e of death from any cause, whichever comes 
first.  Included in the definition of progr ession for PFS are: objective progression of CNS 
lesions on MRI, neurologic deterioration leading to study discontinuation, global 
deterioration of health stat us requiring discontinuation of treatment, and death. For 
neurologic symptoms, the default will be to  assume that worsening of neurologic 
symptoms requiring discontinuation of treatment is related to progressive disease. However, it is anticipated that some patients may discontinue due to peripheral 
neuropathy or other neurologic symptoms that are more likely related to cumulative drug toxicity rather than CNS progression. For patients who are ta ken off of protocol treatment 
for a reason(s) other than progression, the date  of PFS will be censored at the date of last 
staging study (either while on or  off protocol therapy) on wh ich the patient is documented 
not to have progressed, or th e date of initiation of alternative anti-cancer therapy, 
whichever comes first. 
11.4.[ADDRESS_175079] as part 
of the DF/HCC Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) facility. CNS response will be 
assessed centrally using the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_175080] 1.1 and recorded in the CRF by 
[CONTACT_152028].  
 
11.5 Neurological Signs and Symptoms (NSS) 
Tumor-associated NSS will be recorded  on Appendix E at each study visit. 
Improvement or worsening of non-tumor associated NSS will not constitute a change in 
NSS. 
Improvement of NSS will be defined if all of the following are satisfied:

90  Decrease by [ADDRESS_175081] 3 weeks (1 cycle) later 
 No development or worsening in any tu mor related NSS during this interval 
 Stable or decreasing steroids during this interval 
In addition, Appendix E contains a global ques tion for the treating investigator, asking 
whether a patient’s neurological status is impr oved, stable or worse. The response to this 
question will be analyzed in relation to the itemized portion of the NSS worksheet, in 
order to further evaluate the utility of th e worksheet in evaluating NSS longitudinally 
over time. 
12 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
12.1 Definitions 
12.1.1  Adverse Event (AE) 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirabl e sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience that develops or worsens in sever ity after starting the first dose of cabozantinib 
or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not cons idered to be related 
to the study.  Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or requi re treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
12.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless 
of causality that:  
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening. Life-threatening means that the person was at immediate risk 
of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191] (i.e., the event required at least a 
24-hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151957] 7/ October 18, 2016

91 length of stay). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151958]/or surgical operations scheduled 
to occur during the study  period, but planned prio r to study entry are not 
considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled 
in the trial, provided that it did not de teriorate in an unexpected manner during 
the trial (e.g., surgery perform ed earlier than planned). 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ab ility to conduct normal life functions. 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
 Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
it may jeopardize the partic ipant and require medical  or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcome s listed above. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convul sions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of  drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Events not considered to be seri ous adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not  associated with 
any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
 Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pr e-existing condition that did not worsen 
 Emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] 
12.1.3  Expectedness 
Adverse events can be 'Exp ected' or 'Unexpected.'  
Expected Adverse Event 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identif ied as resulting from 
administration of the agent. For the purpos es of this study, an adverse event is 
considered expected when it appears in the cu rrent adverse event list , the Investigator’s

Unexpected Adverse Event 
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected when it varies 
in nature, intensity or frequency from info rmation provided in the current adverse event 
list, the Investigator’s Brochur e, the package insert or when it is not included in the 
informed consent document as a potential risk.   
12.1.4  Attribution 
Assessment of the relationship of the AE to the cabozantinib by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator is based 
on the following two definitions: 
 Not Related: A not-related AE is defined as an AE that is not associated with the 
cabozantinib and is attribut able to another cause. 
 Related: A related AE is defined as an  AE where a causal relationship between 
the event and the cabozantinib is a reas onable possibility. A reasonable causal 
relationship is meant to convey that there are facts (eg, evidence such as 
dechallenge/ rechallenge) or other clin ical arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship between the AE and cabozantinib.

15 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
15.1 Study Design / Endpoints 
This is a two-stage phase [ADDRESS_175098] cancer 
with known brain metastases, and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_151961]184 for ER+ and TN breast cancer 
with known brain metastases. 
  The primary endpoint is response, defined as  a confirmed CR or confirmed PR per CNS 
objective response.  Patients who do not ach ieve a confirmed CR or confirmed PR will 
be considered non-responders. Assuming th e study does not terminate early and all 
patients enrolled begin protocol therapy, the 95% CI for the response rate will be determined accounting for the two-stage design. 
 All other analyses are exploratory with no pl ans for formal hypothesis testing given the 
limited sample size. Analyses will treat as cat egorical variables c-MET amplification in 
CTC’s, or marker levels that  can be categorized using esta blished cutpoints. Variables 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_152032]. For markers without an established cutpoint, 
analyses will involve summary statistics by [CONTACT_152032]. PFS and OS, as defined 
in Section 11.4.5, will be described using the method of Kaplan-Meier.  The point 
estimate of median PFS and OS, as well as esti mates of PFS and OS at other time points, 
will be presented with 95% confidence intervals derived using log(-log(PFS)) methodology.  
15.2 Sample Size / Accrual Rate 
There are no data on the res ponse rate to XL184 in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
and brain metastases.  A true rate of 30% among predominantly pretreated patients with 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer would be considered worthy of further study. A 
true rate of 5% or less woul d not be of clinical interest . This is a one-arm two-stage 
Phase II study of cabozantinib in breast cancer with brain metastases    
Version 7/ October 18, [ADDRESS_175099] high power (90%) with 
a Type I error no more than 10%.   In the first stage, [ADDRESS_175100] a response rate, the regimen will be considered worthy of 
further study.  With this design, the probability  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16505] 70% if the 
true response rate is 5%, and 8%  if the true response rate is 30%. If the true response rate 
is 5%, the chance the regimen is declared wort hy of further study is 10% and if the true 
response rate is 30% the chance that the regi men is declared wort hy of further study is 
90%.  Update: As of October 20, 2015, there have been  no confirmed CNS objective responses 
by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_175101] seven patients enro lled in the HER2+ cohort.  There has been 
one volumetric partial response (PR) in the brain, along with a partial response (PR) in 
the body (Table 17). In addition, patients have  remained on trial for a significant amount 
of time, with two of seven patients on st udy for 9 cycles, and one on for 8 cycles, with 
continued stable disease. Given that there seems to be t meaningful clinical benefit 
received with the agent, we felt further study of  this agent is warrant ed in this population.  
Thus, an additional 14 patients will be enro lled to a maximum of 21 HER2+ patients in 
order to have more precise estimates of the efficacy of cabozantinib  in patients with 
metastatic breast cancer and brain metastases.  Table 17 : Data for the HER2+ Cohort as of October 20, [ADDRESS_175102] Volume

partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progre ssive disease, 5) early death from malignant 
disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early  death because of other cause, or 9) unknown 
(not assessable, insufficient data). By [CONTACT_152033], category 9 usually designates 
the "unknown" status of any type of data in a clinical database.              
16 PUBLICATION PLAN

Procedures for Collecting and Shippin g Optional Research Biopsy Tissue 
Tissue specimens will be collected from recurrent or metastatic lesions using standard 
institutional procedures. The am ount of tissue collected  will follow the guidelines listed below:  
 Breast: A goal of 3-[ADDRESS_175124] mass. 
 
Skin/chest wall: A goal of 1-2 5-mm punch biops ies will be obtained.  
 Lymph node: A goal of 3-6 core biopsy specimens will be obtained using an 18-gauge needle.  
 Liver:  A goal of 3-6 core biopsy specimens will be obtained using an 18-gauge needle. 
 Lung: Because of the risk of pneumothorax associated with core needle biopsies of lung nodules, 
no core biopsies of lung nodules wi ll be performed on this protocol; unless if they are clinically 
indicated.   
Bone:  Because the yield of malignant  tissue from bone biopsies tends to be relatively low, if a 
patient has another accessible site  of disease (i.e. skin, lymph node, liver), that site should be 
biopsied preferentially. If bone is the only biopsy-acce ssible site, then a goal of 3-6 core biopsy 
specimens will be obtained using an 11-13 gauge needle. 
 Pleural Fluid:  A goal of [ADDRESS_175125] thoracentesis 
procedure, with or without image guidance, acco rding to the clinical judgment of the treating 
physician and clinician performing the procedure.  Less than the goal amount is acceptable, and 
should be based upon the clinical judgment of the Investigator and the clinician performing the 
procedure. If more than the goal amount of fluid is obtained, then the enti re specimen (with the 
exception of what is needed for c linical purposes, if app licable) will be stored  in the tissue bank.

CONFIDENTIAL 
This document is confidentia l. Do not disclose or use except as authorized. 
118  Ascites fluid:  A goal of [ADDRESS_175126] paracentesis 
procedure, with or without image guidance, acco rding to the clinical judgment of the treating 
physician and clinician performing the procedure.  Less than the goal amount is acceptable, and 
should be based upon the clinical judgment of the Investigator and the clinician performing the 
procedure. If more than the goal amount of fluid is obtained, then the enti re specimen (with the 
exception of what is needed for c linical purposes, if app licable) will be stored  in the tissue bank. 
 
Please note that the above are guidelines for the amount of tissue to be obtained, and are 
not meant to replace clinical judgment at  the time the procedure is performed . Less than the 
goal quantity of tissue is accepted for each type  of biopsy, and will be left to the clinical 
judgment of the physician performing the  procedure. If ascites or pleural fluid is to be used as the 
investigational biopsy specimen,  consideration should be given to confirming the malignant 
nature of the ascites or pleural  fluid prior to study entry.  
 If a patient is undergoing resection of a lesion for clinical reasons (i.e. wedge resection of a 
new lung lesion for confirmation of diagnosis or re-testing of hormone receptor or HER2 status; 
or, resection of a chest wall lesi on; or, resection of a lymph node ), then the patient may opt to 
have a portion of that tissue (roughly equivalent to the goal amount of tissue listed in the 
guidelines above, i.e. the equiva lent of two 5-mm punch biopsies of the skin, or 3-6 18-gauge 
core biopsies) stored for research at the time of the procedure (provided that the tissue is 
processed as specified), in whic h case, the patient would not be  required to undergo a separate 
research biopsy for entry into this protocol. 
 
Half of the cores should be frozen in OCT and the other half should be placed in formalin 
and made into paraffin blocks.

              SPECIAL NURSING CONSIDERATIONS UNIQUE TO THIS PROTOCOL Study Design 
 It is estimated that approximately 10-15% of women with metastatic breast cancer will eventually develop brain 
metastases. Recent data suggests that anti-angiogenic therapy can be safely given to patients with brain 
metastases and clinical activity has been not ed.  Evidence from studies suggests that cabozantinib  has anti-
angiogenic activity, CNS penetration, activity in breast canc er and could be efficacious in the treatment of brain 
metastases from breast cancer.  In this study, par ticipants with HER2-positive will also be treated with 
trastuzumab  (humanized anti-HER2 antibody). Study Design – Section 1.1; Study Rationale – Section 2.6; A 
cycle is 21 days  – Section 1.1 Dose

three weeks until disease progression [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 92 
 
4 2.3 Important Dosing Considerations 93 
If the patient has missed a dose of Herceptin by [CONTACT_152045], then the usual maintenance dose 94 
(weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly schedule: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as 95 
possible.  Do not wait until the next planned cycle.  Subsequent Herceptin maintenance doses should 96 
be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules, 97 
respectively. 98 
If the patient has missed a dose of Herceptin by [CONTACT_74563], a re-loading dose of 99 
Herceptin should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly schedule: 4 mg/kg; three- 100 
weekly schedule: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible.  Subsequent Herceptin maintenance doses (weekly 101 
schedule: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly schedule 6 mg/kg) should be administered 7 days or 21 days later 102 
according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules, respectively. 103 
Infusion Reactions 104 
[See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]  105 
• Decrease the rate of infusion for mild or moderate infusion reactions 106 
• Interrupt the infusion in patients with dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension 107 
• Discontinue Herceptin for severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. 108 
Cardiomyopathy 109 
[See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  110 
 Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of Herceptin and at regular [ADDRESS_175146] 4 weeks for either of the 112 
following: 113 
•  ≥ 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values 114 
• LVEF below institutional limits of normal and ≥ 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from 115 
pretreatment values. 116 
 Herceptin may be resumed if, within 4−8 weeks, the LVEF returns to normal limits and the 117 
absolute decrease from baseline is ≤ 15%. 118 
 Permanently discontinue Herceptin for a persistent (> 8 weeks) LVEF decline or for suspension of 119 
Herceptin dosing on more than 3 occasions for cardiomyopathy. 120 
2.4 Preparation for Administration 121 
 To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being 122 
prepared and administered is Herceptin (trastuzumab) and not ado-trastuzumab emtansine. 123 
420 mg Multiple-dose vial 124 
Reconstitution 125 
 Reconstitute each 420 mg vial of Herceptin with 20 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection 126 
(BWFI), USP, containing 1.1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative to yield a multiple-dose solution 127 
containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab that delivers 20 mL (420 mg trastuzumab).  In patients with 128 
known hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol, reconstitute with 20 mL of Sterile Water for Injection 129 
(SWFI) without preservative to yield a single use solution. 130 
 Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: 131 
• Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the 20 mL of diluent into the vial containing the 132 
lyophilized cake of Herceptin.  The stream of diluent should be directed into the lyophilized 133 
cake. The reconstituted vial yields a solution for multiple-dose use, containing 21 mg/mL 134 
trastuzumab. 135 
• Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution.  DO NOT SHAKE. 136 
• Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution.  Allow the vial to stand 137 
undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes. 138 
 
5 • Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration [ADDRESS_175147] visually for 140 
particulates and discoloration.  The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to 141 
slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. 142 
• Store reconstituted Herceptin in the refrigerator at 2○C to 8○C (36°F to 46°F); discard unused [ADDRESS_175148] any unused portion.  Do not freeze. 145 
Dilution 146 
• Determine the dose (mg) of Herceptin [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)] .  Calculate the 147 
volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted Herceptin solution needed, withdraw this amount from 148 
the vial and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 149 
USP.  DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION. 150 
• Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. 151 
• The solution of Herceptin for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags 152 
containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 153 
46°F) for no more than 24 hours prior to use. Do not freeze. 154 
 155 
150 mg Single-dose vial 156 
Reconstitution 157 
 Reconstitute each 150 mg vial of Herceptin with 7.4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) 158 
(not supplied) to yield a single-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab that delivers 7.15 159 
mL (150 mg trastuzumab). 160 
 Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the following reconstitution steps: 161 
• Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.4 mL of SWFI (not supplied) into the vial containing 162 
the lyophilized 150 mg Herceptin, directing the diluent stream into the lyophilized cake. The 163 
reconstituted vial yields a solution for single-dose use, containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab. 164 
• Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution.  DO NOT SHAKE.  165 
• Slight foaming of the product may be present upon reconstitution.  Allow the vial to stand 166 
undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes.  167 
• Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration [ADDRESS_175149] visually for 169 
particulates and discoloration.  The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear to 170 
slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. 171 
• Use the Herceptin solution immediately following reconstitution with SWFI, as it contains no 172 
preservative and is intended for single-dose only. If not used immediately, store the 173 
reconstituted Herceptin solution for up to 24 hours at 2○C to 8○C (36○F to 46○F); discard any 174 
unused Herceptin after 24 hours.  Do not freeze.  175 
Dilution 176 
• Determine the dose (mg) of Herceptin [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] .   177 
• Calculate the volume of the 21 mg/mL reconstituted Herceptin solution needed. 178 
• Withdraw this amount from the vial and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 179 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  DO NOT USE DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION. 180 
• Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. 181 
• The solution of Herceptin for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags 182 
containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 183 
46°F) for no more than [ADDRESS_175150] after 24 hours.  This storage time is 184 
additional to the time allowed for the reconstituted vials.  Do not freeze. 185

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 194 
5.1 Cardiomyopathy 195 
 Herceptin can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling 196 
cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death [see Boxed Warning: Cardiomyopathy] .  197 
Herceptin can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 198 
 There is a 4−[ADDRESS_175151] absolute incidence occurs when Herceptin is administered with an 201 
anthracycline. 202 
 Withhold Herceptin for ≥ 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF 203 
value below institutional limits of normal and ≥ 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment 204 
values [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .  The safety of continuation or resumption of 205 
Herceptin in patients with Herceptin-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been 206 
studied. 207 
 Patients who receive anthracycline after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151971] 208 
cardiac dysfunction [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .   [ADDRESS_175152] thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination 211 
of LVEF by [CONTACT_152046].  The following schedule is recommended: 212 
• Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of Herceptin 213 
• LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of Herceptin 214 
• Repeat LVEF measurement at 4 week intervals if Herceptin is withheld for significant left 215 
ventricular cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  216 
• LVEF measurements every [ADDRESS_175153] 2 years following completion of Herceptin as 217 
a component of adjuvant therapy. 218 
 In Study 1, 15% (158/1031) of patients discontinued Herceptin due to clinical evidence of 219 
myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in LVEF after a median follow-up duration of 220 
8.7 years in the AC-TH arm.  In Study 3 (one-year Herceptin treatment), the number of patients who 221 
discontinued Herceptin due to cardiac toxicity at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up was 222 
2.6% (44/1678).  In Study 4, a total of 2.9% (31/1056) of patients in the TCH arm (1.5% during the 223 
chemotherapy phase and 1.4% during the monotherapy phase) and 5.7% (61/1068) of patients in the 224 
AC-TH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 4.2% during the monotherapy phase) 225 
discontinued Herceptin due to cardiac toxicity. 226 
 Among 64 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (Studies 1 and 2) who developed congestive [ADDRESS_175154] follow-up.  Approximately 24% 229 
of the surviving patients had recovery to a normal LVEF (defined as ≥ 50%) and no symptoms on [ADDRESS_175155] follow-up.  Incidence of congestive heart failure 231

Pharmacology (12.3)]. 274 
5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity 275 
 Herceptin use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity.  Pulmonary toxicity includes 276 
dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic 277 
pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], and 278 
pulmonary fibrosis.  Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions  [see Warnings and 279 
Precautions (5.2)] .  Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor [ADDRESS_175162] more severe toxicity. 281 
5.5 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia 282 
 In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3−4 283 
neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving Herceptin in combination 284 
with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone.  The 285 
incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received Herceptin and those who did not 286

requiring interruption or discontinuation of Herceptin treatment include CHF, significant decline in 300 
 
9 left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity [see Dosage and 301 
Administration (2.3)] . [ADDRESS_175164] common adverse reactions (≥  10%) that were 303 
increased (≥  5% difference) in the Herceptin arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm were [ADDRESS_175165] exposure to one-year Herceptin therapy across three randomized, 315 
open-label studies, Studies 1, 2, and 3, with (n  = 3678) or without (n  = 3363) trastuzumab in the [ADDRESS_175166] exposure to Herceptin in 318 
1678 patients; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks and median number of infusions was 18.  319 
Among the 3386 patients enrolled in the observation and one-year Herceptin arms of Study 3 at a 320 
median duration of follow-up of 12.6 months in the Herceptin arm, the median age was 49 years 321 
(range: 21 to 80 years), 83% of patients were Caucasian, and 13% were Asian. 322

 325 
 In Study 3, a comparison of 3-weekly Herceptin treatment for two years versus one year was also 326 
performed.  The rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year Herceptin 327 
treatment arm (8.1% versus 4.6% in the one-year Herceptin treatment arm).  More patients [ADDRESS_175167] one adverse reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the 2-year Herceptin treatment arm 329 
(20.4%) compared with the one-year Herceptin treatment arm (16.3%). 330 
 The safety data from Studies 1 and 2 were obtained from 3655 patients, of whom 2000 received 331 
Herceptin; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks.  The median age was 49 years (range: 332 
24−80); 84% of patients were White, 7% Black, 4% Hispanic, and 3% Asian.   333 
 In Study 1, only Grade 3−5 adverse events, treatment-related Grade 2 events, and Grade 2−5 334 
dyspnea were collected during and for up to 3 months following protocol-specified treatment.  The 335 
following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2 −[ADDRESS_175168] 2% greater 336 
among patients receiving Herceptin plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone:  fatigue 337 
(29.5% vs. 22.4%), infection (24.0% vs. 12.8%), hot flashes (17.1% vs. 15.0%), anemia (12.3% vs. 338 
6.7%), dyspnea (11.8% vs. 4.6%), rash/desquamation (10.9% vs. 7.6%), leukopenia (10.5% vs. 339 
8.4%), neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3%), headache (6.2% vs. 3.8%), pain (5.5% vs. 3.0%), edema (4.7% 340 
vs. 2.7%), and insomnia (4.3% vs. 1.5%).  The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity.  341 
 In Study 2, data collection was limited to the following investigator-attributed treatment-related 342 
adverse reactions: NCI-CTC Grade 4 and 5 hematologic toxicities, Grade 3−5 non-hematologic 343 
toxicities, selected Grade 2−5 toxicities associated with taxanes (myalgia, arthralgias, nail changes, 344 
motor neuropathy, and sensory neuropathy) and Grade 1−5 cardiac toxicities occurring during 345 
chemotherapy and/or Herceptin treatment.  The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of 346 
Grade 2−[ADDRESS_175169] 2% greater among patients receiving Herceptin plus 347 
chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone:  arthralgia (12.2% vs. 9.1%), nail changes 348

12 The overall median treatment duration was 54 weeks in both the AC-TH and TCH arms.  353 
The median number of infusions was 26 in the AC-TH arm and 30 in the TCH arm, including 354 
weekly infusions during the chemotherapy phase and every three week dosing in the monotherapy 355 
period.  Among these patients, the median age was 49 years (range 22 to 74 years).  In Study 4, the [ADDRESS_175171] exposure to Herceptin in one randomized, open-label study, Study 5, of 360 
chemotherapy with (n  = 235) or without (n  = 234) trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast 361 
cancer, and one single-arm study (Study 6; n  = 222) in patients with metastatic breast cancer.  Data 362 
in Table 4 are based on Studies 5 and 6. 363 
 Among the 464 patients treated in Study 5, the median age was 52 years (range: 25−77 years).  364 
Eighty-nine percent were White, 5% Black, 1% Asian, and 5% other racial/ethnic groups.  365 
All patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of Herceptin followed by 2 mg/kg weekly.  The 366 
percentages of patients who received Herceptin treatment for ≥ 6 months and ≥ 12 months were 58% 367 
and 9%, respectively. 368 
 Among the 352 patients treated in single agent studies (213 patients from Study 6), the median 369 
age was 50 years (range 28−86 years), 86% were White, 3% were Black, 3% were Asian, and 8% in 370 
other racial/ethnic groups.  Most of the patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of Herceptin followed 371 
by 2 mg/kg weekly.  The percentages of patients who received Herceptin treatment for ≥ 6 months 372 
and ≥ 12 months were 31% and 16%, respectively. 373

 Serial measurement of cardiac function (LVEF) was obtained in clinical trials in the adjuvant [ADDRESS_175173] cancer.  In Study 3, the median duration of follow-up was 12.6 months 394 
(12.4 months in the observation arm; 12.6 months in the 1-year Herceptin arm); and in Studies 1 and 395 
2, 7.9 years in the AC-T arm, 8.3 years in the AC-TH arm.  In Studies 1 and 2, 6% of all randomized [ADDRESS_175174]-AC LVEF evaluation were not permitted to initiate Herceptin following 397 
completion of AC chemotherapy due to cardiac dysfunction (LVEF < LLN or ≥ 16 point decline in 398 
LVEF from baseline to end of AC).  Following initiation of Herceptin therapy, the incidence of 399 
new-onset dose-limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving Herceptin and 400 
paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in Studies 1 and 2, and in patients 401 
receiving one-year Herceptin monotherapy compared to observation in Study 3 (see Table 6, 402 
Figures 1 and 2).  The per-patient incidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction, as measured by 403 
LVEF, remained similar  when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow-up of 2.0 404 
years in the AC-TH arm.  This analysis also showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular 405 
dysfunction, with 64.5% of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC-TH group being [ADDRESS_175175] follow-up, and 90.3% having full or partial LVEF recovery. 407

Herceptin concurrently with anthracyclines. 436 
 In Study 7, 5.0% of patients in the Herceptin plus chemotherapy arm compared to 1.1% of 437 
patients in the chemotherapy alone arm had LVEF value below 50% with a  ≥ 10% absolute decrease [ADDRESS_175178] commonly reported were chills and 441 
fever, occurring in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials.  Symptoms were treated with 442 
acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and meperidine (with or without reduction in the rate of 443 
Herceptin infusion); permanent discontinuation of Herceptin for infusion reactions was required in 444 
< 1% of patients.  Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases 445 
at tumor sites), rigors, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, elevated blood pressure, rash, and 446 
asthenia.  Infusion reactions occurred in 21% and 35% of patients, and were severe in 1.4% and 9% [ADDRESS_175179] been reported.   450 
Anemia 451 
 In randomized controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of anemia (30% vs. 21% [Study 5]), 452 
of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2–5 anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7% [Study 1]), and of anemia requiring 453 
transfusions (0.1% vs. 0 patients [Study 2]) were increased in patients receiving Herceptin and 454 
chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone.  Following the administration of 455 
Herceptin as a single agent (Study 6), the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 anemia was < 1%.  In 456 
Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer), on the Herceptin containing arm as compared to the 457 
chemotherapy alone arm, the overall incidence of anemia was 28% compared to 21% and of NCI- 458 
CTC Grade 3/4 anemia was 12.2% compared to 10.3%. 459 
Neutropenia 460 
 In randomized controlled clinical trials in the adjuvant setting, the incidence of selected 461 
NCI-CTC Grade 4−5 neutropenia (1.7% vs. 0.8% [Study 2]) and of selected Grade 2−5 neutropenia 462 
(6.4% vs. 4.3% [Study 1]) were increased in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy [ADDRESS_175180] cancer, the incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% vs. 22%) and 465 
of febrile neutropenia (23% vs. 17%) were also increased in patients randomized to Herceptin in 466 
combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone.  In Study 7 467 
(metastatic gastric cancer) on the Herceptin containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone 468 
arm, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 36.8% compared to 28.9%; febrile 469 
neutropenia 5.1% compared to 2.8%. 470 
Infection 471 
 The overall incidences of infection (46% vs. 30% [Study 5]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2−5 472 
infection/febrile neutropenia (24.3% vs. 13.4% [Study 1]) and of selected Grade 3−5 473 
infection/febrile neutropenia (2.9% vs. 1.4%) [Study 2]) were higher in patients receiving Herceptin [ADDRESS_175181]. 476 
 In Study 4, the overall incidence of infection was higher with the addition of Herceptin to AC-T 477 
but not to TCH [44% (AC-TH), 37% (TCH), 38% (AC-T)].  The incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3−4 478 
infection were similar [25% (AC-TH), 21% (TCH), 23% (AC-T)] across the three arms. [ADDRESS_175182] cancer, the reported incidence of 480 
febrile neutropenia was higher (23% vs. 17%) in patients receiving Herceptin in combination with [ADDRESS_175183] cancer, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC 485 
Grade 2−5 pulmonary toxicity (14.3% vs. 5.4% [Study 1]) and of selected NCI-CTC Grade 3−5 486

and Precautions (5.4). 503 
Thrombosis/Embolism 504 
 In 4 randomized, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of thrombotic adverse events was higher 505 
in patients receiving Herceptin and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in three studies 506 
(2.6% vs. 1.5% [Study 1], 2.5% and 3.7% vs. 2.2% [Study 4] and 2.1% vs. 0% [Study 5]). [ADDRESS_175186] cancer, the incidence of NCI-CTC 509 
Grade 2−5 diarrhea (6.7% vs. 5.4% [Study 1]) and of NCI-CTC Grade 3−5 diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0% 510

12.6  months median duration of follow-up]) were higher in patients receiving Herceptin as compared 512 
to controls.  In Study 4, the incidence of Grade 3−4 diarrhea was higher [5.7% AC-TH, 5.5% TCH 513 
vs. 3.0% AC-T] and of Grade 1−4 was higher [51% AC-TH, 63% TCH vs. 43% AC-T] among [ADDRESS_175187] cancer, 25% experienced diarrhea.  An increased incidence of diarrhea was [ADDRESS_175188] cancer. 518 
Renal Toxicity 519 
 In Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer) on the Herceptin-containing arm as compared to the 520 
chemotherapy alone arm the incidence of renal impairment was 18% compared to 14.5%.  Severe 521 
(Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the Herceptin-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the 522 
chemotherapy only arm.  Treatment discontinuation for renal insufficiency/failure was 2% on the 523 
Herceptin-containing arm and 0.3% on the chemotherapy only arm.  [ADDRESS_175189] cancer, human anti-human antibody (HAHA) to Herceptin was detected in one 532

  The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population 577 
is unknown.  In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects 578 
and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.   579 
Clinical Considerations 580 
Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions [ADDRESS_175195]-marketing reports, use of Herceptin during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios 587 
and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting in the fetus as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal 588 
abnormalities, and neonatal death.  These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant 589 
women who received Herceptin either alone or in combination with chemotherapy.  In some case 590 
reports, amniotic fluid index increased after Herceptin was stopped.  In one case, Herceptin therapy 591 
resumed after amniotic index improved and oligohydramnios recurred. 592 
Animal Data 593 
 In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during the 594 
period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the 595 
recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the 596 
early (Gestat ion Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation.  The 597 
resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% 598 
and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse [ADDRESS_175196] human IgG is present in 604

Trastuzumab was present in the milk of lactating Cynomolgus monkeys but not associated with 606

with the mother’s clinical need for Herceptin treatment and any potential adverse effects on the 608 
breastfed child from Herceptin or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should 609 
also take into account the trastuzumab wash out period of 7 months [see Clinical Pharmacology 610 
(12.3)].  [ADDRESS_175197] milk at about 0.3% of 613

8.5 Geriatric Use 632 
 Herceptin has been administered to 386 patients who were 65 years of age or over ([ADDRESS_175201] cancer treatment settings).  The risk of cardiac [ADDRESS_175202] cancer preclude a determination of whether the toxicity profile of 638 
Herceptin in older patients is different from younger patients.  The reported clinical experience is not 639 
adequate to determine whether the efficacy improvements (ORR, TTP, OS, DFS) of Herceptin 640 
treatment in older patients is different from that observed in patients < 65 years of age for metastatic 641 
disease and adjuvant treatment. 642 
 In Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer), of the 294 patients treated with Herceptin, 108 (37%) were 643 
65 years of age or older, while 13 (4.4%) were 75 and over.  No overall differences in safety or 644 
effectiveness were observed. 645

10 OVERDOSAGE 647 
 There is no experience with overdosage in human clinical trials.  Single doses higher than 8 mg/kg [ADDRESS_175203] not been tested. 649

11 DESCRIPTION 651 
 Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds 652 
with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 653 
protein, HER2.  Trastuzumab is produced by [CONTACT_94988] a mammalian cell 654 
(Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture containing the antibiotic gentamicin.  Gentamicin is not detectable [ADDRESS_175204]. 656 
 Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a sterile, white to pale yellow, preservative-free lyophilized powder for 657 
Injection, for intravenous administration.   658 
 Each multiple-dose vial of Herceptin delivers 420 mg trastuzumab, 381.8 mg α,α-trehalose 659 
dihydrate, 9.5 mg L-histidine HCl monohydrate, 6.1 mg L-histidine, and 1.7 mg polysorbate 20.  660 
Reconstitution with 20 mL of the appropriate diluent (BWFI or SWFI) yields a solution containing 661 
21 mg/mL trastuzumab at a pH of approximately 6.   If Herceptin is reconstituted with SWFI without 662 
preservative, the reconstituted solution is considered single-dose. 663 
 Each single-dose vial of Herceptin delivers 150 mg trastuzumab, 136.2 mg α,α-trehalose 664 
dihydrate, 3.4 mg L-histidine HCl monohydrate, 2.2 mg L-histidine, and 0.6 mg polysorbate 20. 665 
Reconstitution with 7.4 mL of sterile water for injection (SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 666 
mg/mL trastuzumab that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab), at a pH of approximately 6. 667

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 669 
12.1 Mechanism of Action 670 
 The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, 671 
which is structurally related to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506].  Herceptin has been shown, in 672 
both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress 673 
HER2. 674 
 Herceptin is a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).  In vitro , 675 
Herceptin-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing 676 
cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 677 
12.2 Pharmacodynamics 678 
Cardiac Electrophysiology 679 
 The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval [ADDRESS_175205] on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum 682 
trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive 683 
solid tumors.  684 
12.3 Pharmacokinetics 685 
 The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic (PK) [ADDRESS_175206] cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) [ADDRESS_175207] cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage; however, the reason for this [ADDRESS_175208] 95% of breast cancer and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3% 699 
of the population predicted steady-state trough serum concentration (approximately 97% washout) 700

Specific Populations 713 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically significant differences were observed 714 
in the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab based on age (< 65 (n = 1294); ≥ 65 (n = 288)), race (Asian 715 
(n = 264); non-Asian (n = 1324)) and renal impairment (mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 60 to 716 
90 mL/min) (n = 636) or moderate (CLcr 30 to 60 mL/min) (n = 133)).  The pharmacokinetics of [ADDRESS_175209] 722 
not been observed. 723 
Paclitaxel and doxorubicin: Concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin and their major 724 
metabolites (i.e., 6-α hydroxyl-paclitaxel [POH], and doxorubicinol [DOL], respectively) were not 725 
altered in the presence of trastuzumab when used as combination therapy in clinical trials. 726 
Trastuzumab concentrations were not altered as part of this combination therapy. 727 
Docetaxel and carboplatin: When Herceptin was administered in combination with docetaxel or 728 
carboplatin, neither the plasma concentrations of docetaxel or carboplatin nor the plasma 729 
concentrations of trastuzumab were altered.   730 
Cisplatin and capecitabine: In a drug interaction substudy conducted in patients in Study 7, the [ADDRESS_175210] 738 
Ames bacterial and human peripheral blood lymphocyte mutagenicity assays at concentrations of up 739 
to 5000 mcg/mL.  In an in vivo micronucleus assay, no evidence of chromosomal damage to mouse 740 
bone marrow cells was observed following bolus intravenous doses of up to 118 mg/kg of 741 
trastuzumab. 742 
 
26  A fertility study was conducted in female Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times the 743 
weekly recommended human dose of 2 mg/kg of trastuzumab and has revealed no evidence of [ADDRESS_175211] cancer were evaluated in an integrated analysis of two randomized, 750 
open-label, clinical trials (Studies 1 and 2) with a total of [ADDRESS_175212] randomized, open-label, clinical trial (Study 3) with a total of 752 
3386 women at definitive Disease-Free Survival analysis for one-year Herceptin treatment versus 753 
observation, and a fourth randomized, open-label clinical trial with a total of 3222 patients (Study 4). [ADDRESS_175213] tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by 756 
IHC) or gene amplification (by [CONTACT_4656]).  HER2 testing was verified by a central laboratory prior to 757 
randomization (Study 2) or was required to be performed at a reference laboratory (Study 1).  758 
Patients with a history of active cardiac disease based on symptoms, abnormal electrocardiographic, 759 
radiologic, or left ventricular ejection fraction findings or uncontrolled hypertension 760 
(diastolic > 100 mm Hg or systolic > 200 mm Hg) were not eligible. 761 
 Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by 762 
paclitaxel (AC→paclitaxel) alone or paclitaxel plus Herceptin (AC →paclitaxel + Herceptin).  763 
In both trials, patients received four 21-day cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 764 
600 mg/m2.  Paclitaxel was administered either weekly (80 mg/m2) or every 3 weeks (175 mg/m2) 765 
for a total of 12 weeks in Study 1; paclitaxel was administered only by [CONTACT_152047] 766 
Study 2.  Herceptin was administered at 4 mg/kg on the day of initiation of paclitaxel and then at a 767 
dose of 2 mg/kg weekly for a total of 52 weeks.  Herceptin treatment was permanently discontinued 768 
in patients who developed congestive heart failure, or persistent/recurrent LVEF decline [see 769 
Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .  Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after the 770 
completion of chemotherapy.  Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy.  771 
The primary endpoint of the combined efficacy analysis was Disease -Free Survival (DFS), defined [ADDRESS_175214] cancer, other second 773 
primary cancer, or death.  The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). 774 
 A total of 3752 patients were included in the joint efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint of 775 
DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC→paclitaxel + Herceptin arm.  The 776 
pre-planned final OS analysis from the joint analysis included 4063 patients and was performed 777 
when 707 deaths had occurred after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC→paclitaxel + 778 
Herceptin arm.  The data from both arms in Study 1 and two of the three study arms in Study 2 were 779 
pooled for efficacy analyses.  The patients included in the primary DFS analysis had a median age of 780 
49 years (range, 22−80 years; 6% > 65 years), 84% were white, 7% black, 4% Hispanic, and 4% 781 
Asian/Pacific Islander.  Disease characteristics included 90% infiltrating ductal histology, 38% T1, 782 
91% nodal involvement, 27% intermediate and 66% high grade pathology, and 53% ER+ and/or 783 
PR+ tumors.  Similar demographic and baseline characteristics were reported for the efficacy 784 
evaluable population, after 8.3 years of median follow-up in the AC→paclitaxel + Herceptin arm.  [ADDRESS_175215] tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression (3+ by [CONTACT_4658]) or 787 
gene amplification (by [CONTACT_4656]) as determined at a central laboratory.  Patients with node-negative [ADDRESS_175216] ≥ T1c primary tumor.  Patients with a history of congestive heart 789 
failure or LVEF <  55%, uncontrolled arrhythmias, angina requiring medication, clinically significant 790 
 
27 valvular heart disease, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, poorly controlled hypertension 791 
(systolic > 180 mm Hg or diastolic > 100 mm Hg) were not eligible. 792 
 Study 3 was designed to compare one and two years of three-weekly Herceptin treatment versus 793 
observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery, established chemotherapy and 794 
radiotherapy (if applicable).  Patients were randomized (1:1:1) upon completion of definitive [ADDRESS_175217] radiotherapy.  Patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ disease received systemic 798 
adjuvant hormonal therapy at investigator discretion.  Herceptin was administered with an initial 799 
dose of 8 mg/kg followed by [CONTACT_13250] 6 mg/kg once every three weeks.  The main 800 
outcome measure was Disease -Free Survival (DFS), defined as in Studies 1 and 2. 801 
 A protocol specified interim efficacy analysis comparing one-year Herceptin treatment to 802 
observation was performed at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months in the Herceptin arm and 803 
formed the basis for the definitive DFS results from this study.  Among the 3386 patients 804 
randomized to the observation (n  = 1693) and Herceptin one-year (n  = 1693) treatment arms, the 805 
median age was 49 years (range 21−80), 83% were Caucasian, and 13% were Asian.  Disease 806 
characteristics:  94% infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 50% ER+ and/or PgR+, 57% node positive, 32% 807 
node negative, and in 11% of patients, nodal status was not assessable due to prior neo-adjuvant 808 
chemotherapy.  Ninety-six  percent (1055/1098) of patients with node-negative disease had high-risk 809 
features: among the 1098 patients with node-negative disease, 49% (543) were ER− and PgR−, and 810 
47% (512) were ER and/or PgR+ and had at least one of the following high-risk features:  811 
pathological tumor size greater than 2 cm, Grade 2−3, or age < 35 years.  Prior to randomization, 812 
94% of patients had received anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. 813 
 After the definitive DFS results comparing observation to one-year Herceptin treatment were 814 
disclosed, a prospectively planned analysis that included comparison of one year versus two years of 815 
Herceptin treatment at a median follow-up duration of 8 years was performed. Based on this 816 
analysis, extending Herceptin treatment for a duration of two years did not show additional benefit 817 
over treatment for one  year [Hazard Ratios of two -years Herceptin versus one-year Herceptin 818 
treatment in the intent to treat (ITT) population for Disease-Free Survival (DFS) = 0.99 (95% CI: 819 
0.87, 1.13), p-value  = 0.90 and Overall Survival (OS)   = 0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value  = 0.78].   [ADDRESS_175218] tumor specimens were required to show HER2 gene amplification (FISH+ only) [ADDRESS_175219] one of the following high-risk features:  ER/PR-negative, tumor 824 
size >  2 cm, age < 35 years, or histologic and/or nuclear Grade 2 or 3.  Patients with a history of 825 
CHF, myocardial infarction, Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmia, angina requiring medication, clinically 826 
significant valvular heart disease, poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic >  100 mm Hg), any T4 or [ADDRESS_175220] cancer were not eligible. 828 
 Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by 829 
docetaxel (AC-T), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by [CONTACT_152048] 830 
(AC-TH), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus Herceptin (TCH).  In both the AC-T and AC-TH arms, 831 
doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 were administered every 3 weeks for 832 
four cycles; docetaxel 100 mg/m2 was administered every 3 weeks for four cycles.  In the TCH arm, 833 
docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin (at a target AUC of 6 mg/mL/min as a 30- to 60-minute 834 
infusion) were administered every 3 weeks for six cycles.  Herceptin was administered weekly 835 
(initial dose of 4 mg/kg followed by [CONTACT_152049] 2 mg/kg) concurrently with either T or TC, and 836 
then every 3 weeks (6 mg/kg) as monotherapy for a total of 52 weeks.  Radiation therapy, if 837 
administered, was initiated after completion of chemotherapy.  Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors 838 
received hormonal therapy.  Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was the main outcome measure. 839 
 
28  Among the 3222 patients randomized, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% 840 
≥ 65 years).  Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive.  Prior to [ADDRESS_175221] cancer. 842 
 The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of Studies 1 and 2, Study 3, and Study 4 and OS 843 
results for the integrated analysis of Studies 1 and 2, and Study 3 are presented in Table 9.  For 844 
Studies 1 and 2, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC→TH arm 845 
is presented in Figure 4, and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the 846 
AC→TH arm is presented in Figure 5.  The duration of DFS for Study [ADDRESS_175222] was different 849 
from that of the overall patient population: patients with low tumor grade, patients within specific 850 
ethnic/racial subgroups (Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander patients), and patients  > [ADDRESS_175223] ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74).  At 8.3 years of median 852 
follow-up [AC→TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC →TH arm and 79.4% in 853 
the AC→T arm.  The final OS analysis results from Studies 1 and 2 indicate that OS benefit by [CONTACT_654], 854 
hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and 855 
surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In 856 
patients ≤ 50 years of age (n  = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in 857 
patients > 50 years of age (n  = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the 858 
subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) 859 
(n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with 860 
hormone receptor-negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n  = 1830), the hazard ratio for 861 
OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size ≤  2 cm (n  = 1604), the [ADDRESS_175224] ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size >  2 863

disease.  Tumor specimens were tested by [CONTACT_4658] (Clinical Trial Assay, CTA) and scored as 0, 1+, 2+, 898 
or 3+, with 3+ indicating the strongest positivity.  Only patients with 2+ or 3+ positive tumors were 899 
eligible (about 33% of those screened).  Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or 900 
in combination with Herceptin given intravenously as a 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by [CONTACT_12884] 901 
doses of Herceptin at 2 mg/kg.  For those who had received prior anthracycline therapy in the 902 
adjuvant setting, chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 over [ADDRESS_175235] six cycles); for all other patients, chemotherapy consisted of anthracycline plus 904 
cyclophosphamide (AC:  doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 or epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962] 75 mg/m2 plus 600 mg/m2 905 
cyclophosphamide every 21 days for six cycles).  Sixty-five percent of patients randomized to 906 
 
33 receive chemotherapy alone in this study received Herceptin at the time of disease progression as 907 
part of a separate extension study. 908 
 Based upon the determination by [CONTACT_152053], the patients 909 
randomized to Herceptin and chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer median time to 910 
disease progression, a higher overall response rate (ORR), and a longer median duration of response 911 
as compared with patients randomized to chemotherapy alone.  Patients randomized to Herceptin 912 
and chemotherapy also had a longer median survival (see Table 11).  These treatment effects were 913 
observed both in patients who received Herceptin plus paclitaxel and in those who received 914 
Herceptin plus AC; however the magnitude of the effects was greater in the paclitaxel subgroup. 915

14.3  Metastatic Gastric Cancer 934 
 The safety and efficacy of Herceptin in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine 935 
(capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) were studied in patients previously untreated for metastatic  gastric or 936 
gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (Study 7).  In this open-label, multi-center trial, 937 
594 patients were randomized 1:1 to Herceptin in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine 938 
(FC+H) or chemotherapy alone (FC).  Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_152056] (metastatic 939 
vs. locally advanced), primary site (gastric vs. gastroesophageal junction), tumor measurability (yes 940 
vs. no), ECOG performance status (0,1 vs. 2), and fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine vs. 5-fluorouracil).  941 
All patients were either HER2 gene amplified (FISH+) or HER2 overexpressing (IHC 3+).  Patients [ADDRESS_175238] adequate cardiac function (e.g., LVEF > 50%). 943 
 On the Herceptin-containing arm, Herceptin was administered as an IV infusion at an initial dose 944 
of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression.  On both study arms 945 
cisplatin was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m2 Day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles as a 2 hour IV 946 
 
35 infusion.  On both study arms, capecitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m2 dose orally twice daily 947 
(total daily dose 2000 mg/m2) for 14 days of each 21 day cycle for 6 cycles. Alternatively, 948 
continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) 5-fluorouracil was administered at a dose of 800 mg/m2/day 949 
from Day 1 through Day 5 every three weeks for 6 cycles.   950 
 The median age of the study population was 60 years (range: 21−83); 76% were male; 53% were 951 
Asian , 38% Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, 5% other racial/ethnic groups; 91% had ECOG PS of 0 or 1; 952 
82% had primary gastric cancer and 18% had primary gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.  Of these 953 
patients, 23% had undergone prior gastrectomy, 7% had received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant 954 
therapy, and 2% had received prior radiotherapy. 955 
 The main outcome measure of Study 7 was overall survival (OS), analyzed by [CONTACT_152057]- [ADDRESS_175239]. The final OS analysis based on 351 deaths was statistically significant (nominal 957 
significance level of 0.0193).  An updated OS analysis was conducted at one year after the final 958 
analysis. The efficacy results of both the final and the updated analyses are summarized in Table 13 959

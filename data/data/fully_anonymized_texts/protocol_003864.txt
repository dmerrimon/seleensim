Name [CONTACT_790]/Company:  Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc.  
Name [CONTACT_791]:  PTG -300 
Protocol Number:  PTG -300-06 Country:  Multiple  
Title of Study: Open -label Study of PTG-300 in Subjects with Hereditary Hemochromatosis 
Study center(s): Multicenter  
Phase of development: 2  
Indication:  Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH)  
Objectives:  
1. To assess the safety and tolerability of PTG -[ADDRESS_808789] of PTG -300 therapy on transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin . 
3. To assess the effect of PTG -300 on iron absorption in a subset of subjects . (For subjects 
participating in the iron absorption substudy). 
4. To assess PTG -300’s efficacy for treating HH subjects as defined by [CONTACT_609991]. 
5. To assess the effect of PTG -300 on quality of life (QoL). 
6. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of 
PTG -300. 
Study Design:  
This is a multicenter, single -arm, open- label study in subjects with HH. Subjects will receive 
subcutaneous PTG-300 for up to 24 weeks. Subjects will start at an initial dose of 10 mg per week 
subcutaneously. The dose may be increased to 20 mg per week, and subsequently to 40 mg and to 
80 mg per week if needed, based on tolerability and the pharmacodynamic marker TSAT . In addition, 
subcutaneous dosing schedules of 10 mg , 20 mg, and 40 mg twice weekly (Day 1 and either Day 4 or 
Day 5) may be tested.  
Subjects’ safety and blood iron parameters ( serum iron, serum ferritin, transferrin, and TSAT ) will be 
collected  to monitor  the pharmacodynamic effect of PTG -300. Effect on phlebotomy need and QoL 
data ( 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [ SF-36], and  Patient’s Global Impression of Change 
[PGI-C]) will also be collected and tabulated. 
A subset of subjects (approximately 6 subjects) will participate in a two -way crossover sequential iron 
(57Fe) absorption substudy. The oral iron absorption substudy  will be conducted once during the 
3-week screening period  and then following approximately 4 to 6 weeks of PTG -300 treatment. 
Methodology: 
Screening (Study Day -21 to - 1) 
After giving written informed consent, subjects will be screened for eligibility according to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion  section) within 2 1 days of 
dosing. Subjects will continue their individual iron restri cted diet throughout the study. During this 
period l iver iron concentration (LIC) will be assessed by [CONTACT_9252] (MRI) . 
Subjects will begin treatment with PTG -[ADDRESS_808790] Therapeutics, Inc. 
Protocol Amendment 3 – 14 September  2020 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  5 of 67 phlebotomy, with iron paramet ers measured before (Screening labs) and after the phlebotomy  (pre-
dose Study Day 1) . Each individual subject’s pre-phlebotomy serum  ferritin level and TSAT will be 
used as a criterion for phlebotomy  during the study, i.e., the threshold at which a phlebotomy should 
be considered during the study. The serum ferritin level and TSAT obtained during Screening will be 
used as baseline to assess the change from these measurements post -dosing with PTG -300. 
After eligibility has been c onfirmed, subjects will be enrolled in the study. 
Treatment Period (Week 1 to Week 25)  
Study Drug Administration: Dosing with PTG-[ADDRESS_808791] subcutaneous (SC) injection at the clinic and will be instructed on how to self- administer the 
injection (or have a caregiver administer the injection) and on appropriate safety monitoring before being discharged.  
On Study Day 2, subjects will return to the clinic for serum iron parameters and PTG -300 blood 
concentration  (PK) measurements.  
Individual Subject Dose and Schedule Escalation : Individual subject dose and schedule will be 
determined  based on the pharmacodynamic (PD) marker TSAT measured at two time points: once at 
peak PD  effect one day post dose and once at trough PD effect. The intent of dose and schedule 
adjustment is to  reduc e TSAT and serum iron levels. The dose of PTG-300 may be increased weekly 
in a sequential manner from 10 mg to 20 mg and, if necessary, to 40 mg and 80 mg until the TSAT is 
less than approximately 40 % at peak PD  effect one day post dose and at the trough PD effect prior to 
the next dose of PTG -300. In addition, the dose may be adjusted to maintain serum ferritin to no more 
than 1.5 times the screening value or 150 ng/mL, whichever is greater. Investigators may consider 
once a week or twice a week dosing of PTG -[ADDRESS_808792] is 
the TSAT value  measured 7 days after the PTG -300 dose (and before the next dose) for once weekly 
dosing or [ADDRESS_808793] 3 days apart (e.g., on Day 1 and Day 4 or 5 of each week). The twice weekly  PTG -300 dose may be escalated to a maximum of 40 mg twice weekly . To fa cilitate 
dose escalation and the identification  of a therapeutic dose, investigators may assess TSAT values on 
days subjects come to the clinic for any dose adjustments . These assessments may occur at times 
other than the regular sched uled visits  indicated on the schedule of events . 
Subjects will continue treatment by [CONTACT_6270]- administering PTG -300 at home (or in the c linical center as 
appropriate) for up to 24 weeks based on acceptable safety and tolerability of the drug (see Safety 
Monitoring). Subjects will return for clinic visits to have safety  assessments; serum iron parameters 
plus soluble transferrin receptor  (sTfR ), hepcidin and antidrug antibodies ( ADA) ; and efficacy 
evaluated according to the schedule of assessments.  
Subjects’ iron parameters will be monitored throughout the study.  
Change in Starting Dose : The starting dose may be increased from 10 mg to 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg 
as appropriate if <[ADDRESS_808794] 4 subjects (or ≤25% of a larger number of subjects) treated at a given 
dose have both peak and trough TSAT values approximately <40% and no safety signals have been noted. 
Criteria for a Phlebotomy: Subjects should undergo an on-study phlebotomy when the subject’s 
serum f erritin levels and  TSAT value are higher than the pre- phlebotomy serum ferritin and TSAT 
values obtained during Screening. In addition, a phlebotomy may be performed when the Investigator assesses it is necessary for subject care.

Protocol Amendment 3 – [ADDRESS_808796] of the study 
population. 
Subjects consenting to participate in the iron absorption  substudy will receive the stable iron isotope 
57Fe orally (approximately 4 mg as ferrous sulfate) on two occasions ; once prior to starting PTG-300 
(i.e., a fter the phlebotomy performed during the Screening period; Iron Absorption A),  and a second 
dose approximately 4 to 6 weeks after starting PTG -300 (i.e., post -treatment; Iron Absorption B) . The 
post- treatment Iron Absorption B administration will occur approximately [ADDRESS_808797] for 
approximately 4 hours after the 57Fe dose. Blood samples will be collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours 
for measurement of 57Fe levels  and for measurement of  iron parameters —serum iron, serum ferritin, 
transferrin, and TSAT . Add itional blood sam ples will be obtained at 0, 4, 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_808798]-Treatment / Early Termination Safety Follow -up (Week 29)  
Subjects who complete the treatment or who discontinue treatment early will undergo Visit 8 /end of 
treatment (EOT) assessments as well as follow -up safety evaluations approximately [ADDRESS_808799] dose of study drug (Visit 9/end of study [EOS]). 
Safety Monitoring: Safety will be monitored throughout the study.  
Safety measures ( including but not limited to physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests , 
complete blood count [ CBC ], vital signs, electrocardiograms [ ECGs ], adverse event monitoring 
[AEs], and concomitant medications) will be evaluated and recorded over the course of the study. 
Any adverse event (AE) that emerges from the time the subject signs an informed consent form (ICF) 
until Study Exit will be recorded and reported. Safety will be assessed using the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.[ADDRESS_808800] one of the following criteria will require  a dose reduction: 
• CTCAE Grade 3 hematological toxicity or worsening of ≥2 grades in hematological parameters not clearly resulting from the underlying disease and/or without a clear-cut 
alternative that does not respond adequately to medical therapy. 
• CTCAE Grade 3 non- hematological toxicities not clearly resulting from the underlying 
disease and/or without a clear -cut alternative that does not respond adequately to medical 
therapy. 
• Treatment -related decrease of hemoglobin ( Hgb) from baseline >20% or Grade 2 anemia, 
whichever is lesser, confirmed by a repeat value and not due to phlebotomy. Prior to 
resumption of PTG -300 at a reduced dose a follow -up Hgb should be assessed to confirm that 
Hgb has stabilized or improved to Grade 1. 
• Investigator determines that the subject has experienced a clinically significan t decrease in 
Hgb due to PTG-300. 
If a treatment -related  increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
>3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) is seen, dosing with PTG-[ADDRESS_808801] and/or ALT levels return to baseline within 14 days; if the levels do not 
return to baseline within 14 days, a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) should be conducted to assess 
whether there is an increase in iron accumulation . 
Protocol Number PTG-300-[ADDRESS_808802] Therapeutics, Inc. 
Protocol Amendment 3 – [ADDRESS_808803] from further treatment with study drug:  
• Any CTCAE Grade 4 hematological or non -hematological toxicity  not clearly resulting from 
the underlying disease and/or without a clear- cut alternative . 
• CTCAE Grade 3 hematological toxicity or worsening of ≥2 grades in hematological 
parameters not clearly resulting from the underlying diseas e and/or without a clear-cut 
alternative persists over 7 days after adequate PTG -300 dose decrease.  
• CTCAE Grade 3 non- hematological toxicities not clearly resulting from the underlying 
disease and/or without a clear -cut alternative explanation that do not improve within 14 days 
with maximal medical therapy and adequate PTG -300 dose decrease.  
• When the Investigator in consultation with the medical monitor ( MM) consider s that it is in 
the subject’s best interest to discontinue treatment with PTG -300 (i.e., persistent, worsening 
or recurrent AEs).  
• If a subject requires a dose reduction below 10 mg administered every 2 weeks. 
• ALT, AST >5 × ULN and rising . 
• ALT, AST remains >5 × ULN w ith no change in total bilirubin for more than 2 weeks . 
• A worsening of clinical symptoms with no other acceptable explanation. 
• The product meets Hy’s Law 
— Any test showing an increase of serum ALT >3 × ULN or >2 × ULN total bilirubin 
should be repeated within [ADDRESS_808804], alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
and total bilirubin . If the repeat value for ALT or total bilirubin is unchanged or indicates 
decreasing activity, monitoring should continue at weekly intervals until the results are 
acceptable o r normalized. 
• Evidence of increased iron accumulation in liver from baseline.

Protocol Amendment 3 – [ADDRESS_808833] Therapeutics, Inc. 
Protocol Amendment 3 – [ADDRESS_808834] Therapeutics, Inc. (Protagonist) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_609985]-300, an injectable peptide 
mimetic of the endogenous hormone hepcidin, as a potential treatment for hereditary 
hemochromatosis ( HH). 
HH is a  rare genetic disorder that disrupts the body’s regulation of iron, caus ing the body to 
absorb too much iron from the diet. In HH types I-III, mutations in genes encoding hepcidin 
regulators, or hepcidin itself lead to diminished production of hepcidin, thus decreasing the 
inhibitory effect of hepcidin on duodenal iron absorption and causing clinical iron overload (Brissot 2011). Hepcidin deficiency  lead s to increased circulating transferrin saturation, and 
ultimately, iron accumulation in organs such as the liver, pancreas, heart, and bone. Iron in excess may induce or favor the development of complications such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, diabetes, heart failure, hypogonadism, but also, complaints such as asthenia and disabling 
arthritis.  If left untreated, HH can lead to morbidity and eventually death ( Katsarou 2019).  
Therapeutic phlebotomy to reduce iron loading is standard treatment for HH. The phlebotomy 
frequency required for a patient is based on serial measurements of their serum ferritin  levels and 
transferrin saturation ( Crownover 2013) . Therapeutic phlebotomy is highly efficient in removing 
excess iron and preventing most of the complications associated with excess iron in the body. However, this treatment does not target the biological mechanisms involved in the iron metabolism disturbance.  
In a hepcidin- deficient mouse model of hemochromatosis, a minihepcidin was effective for 
decreasing iron loading in the liver and heart compared to solvent control in mice that were not 
iron overloaded ( Ramos 2012). These observations suggest t hat a hepcidin mimetic such as 
PTG -300 may be effective for preventing iron overload in patients with hemochromatosis. 
5.1.1. Rationale for the Development of PTG-300 
PTG -300 is a peptidic agent structurally related to natural hepcidin that mimics its inhibitory 
activity on ferroportin. Hepcidin is a peptide hormone that is the body’s main regulator of iron 
homeostasis ( Liu 2016, Ruchala 2014). Hepcidin binds to ferroportin causing internalization and 
degradation of ferroportin. Hepcidin binding to ferroportin on enterocytes blocks iron absorption 
from the gastrointestinal tract. The inhibitory effect of hepcidin on ferroportin in macrophages 
and hepatocytes leads to a decrease in the efflux of iron from t hese cellular sites of iron storage 
(Camaschella 2013 ). Because there are no mechanisms for the efflux of iron from cells other 
than ferroportin, and because iron is both essential and (in excess) toxic, the role of hepcidin is of central importance to iron regulation and erythropoiesis. Hepcidin’s critical role in iron metabolism suggests that hepcidin mimetics such as PTG-300 may be effective for treating a 
variety of conditions characterized by [CONTACT_609994]. The rationale for testing PTG -300 in patients with HH is based on its potential ability to restore normal hepcidin function 
in patients with HH and thereby [CONTACT_609995]. 
The overall goal of the current protocol is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PTG -300 in  
reducing phlebotomy requirement in patients with HH. The protocol is a Phase 2, single- arm, 
open- label  study (with an iron absorption substudy).

guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
5.2. Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Studies  
5.2.1. Nonclinical S tudies  
PTG -300 is a peptidic agent structurally related to natural hepcidin and PTG-300’s effects in 
toxicology studies mimic the effects of hepcidin. In studies of wild type mice, rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys, single dose subcutaneous or intravenous administration of PTG-[ADDRESS_808836] on serum iron is brisk in onset (within a few 
hours of subcutaneous dosing in the thalassemic mouse model) and, depending on the dose, can 
be quite profound and prolonged. For example, in wild type healthy mice, the ef fect of a 
2.5 mg/kg subcutaneous dose on serum iron persists for at least 30 hours with serum iron 
declining to a nadir (90% reduction) 10 hours after dosing. 
PTG -300 was evaluated in a comprehensive toxicology program including Good Laboratory 
Practice (G LP)-compliant studies. Specific GLP studies included up to 26-week rat and up to 
39-week cynomolgus monkey toxicology studies with 4- week or 5 -week reversal periods, as 
well as genetic toxicology studies to assess potential in vitro  mutagenesis, in vitro  chromosomal 
aberrations, and in vivo chromosomal aberrations. Safety pharmacology studies included hERG 
assay and i n vivo studies to assess potential effects on cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , and 
neurobehavioral parameters.  
In toxicology studies, PTG-300 caus es exaggerated pharmacological responses in rat s and 
cynomolgus monkeys when dosed for up to 26 or 39 weekly doses. The primary effects of 
PTG -300 in rats and cynomolgus monkeys are decreases in red blood cell count, hematocrit, and 
hemoglobin (Hgb) with e ither compensatory increases of reticulocyte counts at lower doses of 
PTG -300 or decreases of reticulocyte counts at high doses of PTG-300. Rats dosed with 
25 mg/kg PTG- [ADDRESS_808837], as well as hepatocellular necrosis that could be secondary to excess iron in 
liver. Rats dosed with 10 mg/kg/dose for [ADDRESS_808838] level ( NOAEL ) was 
determined to be 10 mg/kg/dose based on a 26- week  toxicology study in rats receiving weekly 
doses of PTG-300 of up to 10 mg/kg/dose. Cynomolgus monkeys dosed with 10 mg/kg PTG-[ADDRESS_808839]. 
Cynomolgus monkeys dosed with 6 mg/kg/dose for 13 weeks had no- adverse effects consistent 
with the expected pharmacology of PTG-300. The NOAEL was determined to be 2 mg/kg/dose 
following 39 weekly doses of PTG-300 at 0.6, 2, and 6 mg/kg/dose in cynomolgus monkeys. 
PTG -300 does not cause adverse injection site reactions in rats dosed up to 26 weeks or 
cynomolgus monkeys dosed up to 39 weeks. In a stand -alone single- dose rat local tolerance 
study with PTG-300 up to 280 mg/kg (280 mg/mL in dose concentration), the incidence and severity of injection site reactions were generally proportional to the dose and showed incomplete but progressive ongoing reversal by [CONTACT_995] [ADDRESS_808840] Therapeutics, Inc. 
Protocol Amendment 3 – 14 September  2020 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  20 of 67  
PTG -300 was also evaluated for embryo-fetal development toxicity in rats and rabbits and 
fertility and early embryonic development toxicity in both male and female rats. The maternal 
NOAEL was 3 mg/kg/dose and the NOAEL for the embryo- fetal development was 
0.3 mg/kg/dose in the definitive embryo- fetal development toxicity study in rats. The maternal 
NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/dose and the NOAEL for the embryo- fetal development was 
0.3 mg/kg/dose in the definitive embryo- fetal development toxicity study in  rabbits. The NOAEL 
for paternal toxicity and the NOEL for effects on male fertility and early embryonic development were considered to be 10 mg/kg/dose in fertility and early embryonic development toxicity study in male rats. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity and the NOEL for effects on female fertility and 
early embryonic development were 3 mg/kg/dose in fertility and early embryonic development 
toxicity study in female rats.  
Principle findings in nonclinical toxicology studies are alterations in red cell m ass. PTG -[ADDRESS_808841] on cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or neurobehavior in safety pharmacology studies. PTG-300 is not genotoxic. 
5.2.2. Clinical S tudies  
To date, PTG-300 has been studied in one completed Phase 1 study in healthy subjects. A 
Phase 2 study of PTG -300 and the study’s open -label extension for treatment of β -thalassemia 
investigat ed doses over a range of [ADDRESS_808842] adverse events were typi[INVESTIGATOR_609986] β -thalassemia. The frequency of adverse 
events did not increase with increasing dose of PTG-300. Adverse events reported in >5% of subjects were upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (11.1%), injection site erythema (9.5%), injection site pain (12.7%), urinary tract infections (7.9%), headache (7.9%), fatigue (6.3%), and pyrexia 
(6.3%). One subject experienced an SAE of confusion, which was considered by [CONTACT_609996]-300. The event fully resolved within [ADDRESS_808843]- in-human 
(FIH), single ascending dose (SAD) and repeat dose study of PTG-300 administered subcutaneously ( SC) in 62 healthy male subjects to evaluate safety/tolerability, PK and PD 
activity (as assessed by [CONTACT_609997]).  Subjects received single doses of 
1 mg to 80 mg PTG -300 or two 40 mg doses 1 week apart.  
Following single dose administration of PTG-300 there was a dose-related reduction in serum 
iron with a maximal reduction of approximately 65% from baseline. The relationship between 
dose and effect appeared to plateau at [ADDRESS_808844] 72  hours at higher doses. In subjects that received 
two 40- mg doses 1 week apart (QW×2) the effects on iron were comparable for both 40-mg

Protocol Amendment 3 – 14 September  2020 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  21 of 67 doses. Serum iron levels did not return to baseline prior to the second dose. Serum iron levels 
generally returned to baseline approximately 1 to 2 weeks following the second dose of 
PTG -300. Following single dose administration area under the concentration -time curve ( AUC ) 
and maximum concentration (C max) increased  with dose; however, the increase was less than 
dose-proportional. 
PTG -300 was well tolerated  by [CONTACT_117954], with no SAEs or dose- limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) at single doses as high as [ADDRESS_808846] frequent advers e events ( AEs) were injection site reactions (characterized primarily by a 
transient erythema at the injection site), headaches and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014]. 
These preclinical and clinical data support clinical development of PTG-[ADDRESS_808847] s with HH who are in maintenance phase and who are on a stable 
phlebotomy regimen. 
5.4. Selection of Doses  
Subjects will initially  receive a subcutaneous dose of 10 mg per week . The dose was based on 
data in healthy subjects indicating that a dose of 10 mg PTG-300 results in an average reduction 
of approximately 19% in serum iron. Iron levels returned to baseline within [ADDRESS_808848]’s dose may be increased to [ADDRESS_808849] 3 days apart (e.g ., on Day 1 and Day 4 or 5 of each week) .
 The intent of 
dose and schedule adjustment is to reduce TSAT and serum iron levels. These higher doses are 
based on Phase 1 data that showed greater decreases in serum iron and TSAT and longer 
duration of decrease compared to the 10 mg dose. A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) has 
determined that doses as high as [ADDRESS_808850] not been observed in nonclinical 
species, however administration of PTG -300 carries theoretical liabilities (immunologically

PTG -300 was well tolerated, with the majority of AEs other than injection site reactions 
(primarily transient erythema) considered to be unrelated to PTG-300. In two ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_808852] s will receive an oral administration of approximately 4 mg 57Fe as a 
ferrous sulfate solution. Stable isotopes are non- radioactive atoms of the same chemical element, 
which differ only in their number of neutrons ( Bodamer 2001).  Such studies are common in 
nutrition science and are often conducted to examine the absorption of selected elements (e.g., 
iron) from various foods and the impact of various diseases. These tracers are considered safe 
and may be particularly important for the validation of new treatment modalities, such as novel drug treatmen ts (Bodamer 2001).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  24 of 67 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a multicenter, single -arm, open-label study in subjects with HH. Subjects will receive 
subcutaneous PTG-300 for up to 24 weeks. Subjects will start at an initial dose of 10 mg per 
week subcutaneously. The dose may be increased to 20 mg per week, and subsequently to 40 mg 
and to 80 mg per week if needed, based on tolerability and the pharmacodynamic marker TSAT. In addition, subcutaneous dosing schedules of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg twice weekly (Day 1 
and either Day 4 or Day 5) may be tested. 
Based on a review of the TSAT and safety data from at least the first 4 subjects, the starting dose 
and/or the dosing regimen may be modified for subsequent subjects to reduce exposure to 
ineffective doses. 
Subjects’ safety and blood iron parameters ( serum iron, serum ferritin, transferrin, and TSAT)
 
will be collected  to monitor the pharmacodynamic effect of PTG -300. Effect on phlebotomy 
need and quality of life ( QoL) data ( 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [ SF-36], and Patient’s 
Global Impression of Change [ PGI-C]) will also be collected and tabulated.  
A subset of subjects (approximately 6 subjects ) will participate in a sequential two -way 
crossover iron (57Fe) absorption substudy. The oral iron absorption substudy will be conducted 
once during the 3- week screening period  and then following approximately 4 to 6 weeks of 
PTG -300 treatment.  
Subjects will participate in this study for up to 3 1 weeks as follows:  
• Screening: Up to 3 weeks  
• PTG -300 Treatment: Up to 24 weeks (may include iron absorption substudy for 
selected subjects)  
• Safety follow up: 4 weeks. 
7.1.1. Screening (Study D ay -21 to -1) 
After giving written informed consent, subjects will be screened for eligibility according to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria ( see Section  8) within 21 days of dosing. Subjects will continue their 
individual iron restricted diet throughout the study. During this period liver iron concentration (LIC) will be assessed by [CONTACT_9252] (MRI). Subjects will begin treatment with PTG -300 within approximately 7 days following a regular phlebotomy, with iron parameters 
measured before (Screening labs) and after the phlebotomy (pre -dose Study Day 1). E ach 
individual subject’s pre- phlebotomy serum ferritin level and TSAT will be used as a criterion for 
phlebotomy during the study, i.e., the threshold at which a phlebotomy should be considered 
during the study. The serum ferritin level and TSAT obtained during Screening will be used as 
baseline to assess the change from these measurements post -dosing with PTG-300. All 
concomitant medications received by [CONTACT_609999] [ADDRESS_808856] Therapeutics, Inc. 
Protocol Amendment 3 – 14 September  2020 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  25 of 67 After eligibility has been confirmed, subjects will be enrolle d in the study. Those subjects who 
choose to participate and complete informed consent for the iron absorption substudy will 
complete their Iron Absorption A session during Screening ( See Section  7.1.3 below). 
7.1.2. Treatment Period (Week 1 to Week 25) 
Study Drug Administration: Dosing with PTG-[ADDRESS_808857] subcutaneous (SC) injection at the clinic and will be instructed on how to self-administer the injection (or have a caregiver administer the injection) and on appropriate safety monitoring before being discharged. 
On Study Day 2, subjects will return to the clinic for serum iron parameters and PTG-300 blood concentration (PK) measurements.  
Individual Subject Dose and Schedule Escalation : Individual subject dose and schedule will be 
determined based on the pharmacodynamic (PD) marker TSAT measured at two time points: once at peak PD effect one day post dose and once at trough PD effect. The intent of dose and schedule adjustment is to reduce TSAT and serum iron levels. The dose of PTG-300 may be 
increased weekly in a sequential manner from 10 mg to 20 mg and, if necessary, to 40 mg and 
80 mg until the TSAT is less than approximately
 40% at peak PD effect one day post dose and at 
the trough PD  effect prior to the next dos e of PTG -300. In addition, the dose may be adjusted to 
maintain serum ferritin to no more than 1.5 times the screening value or 150 ng/mL, whichever is greater. Investigators may consider once a week or twice a week dosing of PTG-[ADDRESS_808858] is the TSAT value measured 7 days after the PTG -300 
dose (and before the next dose) for once weekly dosing or [ADDRESS_808859] 3 days 
apart (e.g., on Day 1 and Day 4 or 5 of each week ). The twice weekly PTG -300 dose may be 
escalated to a maximum of 40 mg twice weekly. To facilitate dose escalation and the identification of a therapeutic dose, investigators may assess TSAT values on days subjects come to the clinic for any dose adjustments. These assessments may occur at times other than the regular scheduled visits indicated on the schedule of events. 
Subjects will continue treatment by [CONTACT_6270] -administering PTG -300 at home (or in the clinical center 
as appropriate) for up to 24 weeks based on acceptable safety and tolerability of the drug 
(Section  7.2). Subjects will return for clinic visits to have safety assessments; serum iron 
parameters plus  soluble transferrin receptor  (sTfR), hepcidin and antidrug antibodies (ADA); and 
efficacy evaluated according to the schedule of assessments.  
Subjects’ iron parameters will be monitored throughout the study. 
Change in S tarting Dose: The starting dose may be increased from 10 mg to 20 mg, 40 mg, or 
80 mg as appropriate if <[ADDRESS_808860] 4 subjects (o r ≤25% of a larger number of subjects) treated 
at a given dose have both peak and trough TSAT values approximately <40% and no safety 
signals have been noted.

Protocol Amendment 3 – 14 September  2020 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  26 of 67 Criteria for a Phlebotomy: Subjects should undergo an on-study phlebotomy when the subject’s 
serum ferritin levels and TSAT value are higher than the pre-phlebotomy serum ferritin and 
TSAT values obtained during Screening. In addition, a phlebotomy may be performed when the Investigator assesses it is necessary for subj ect care.  
7.1.3. Iron Absorption Substudy  (See Table 3 ) 
Iron absorption subjects will be treated and monitored in an identical manner as the rest of the study population. 
Subjects consenting to participate in the iron absorption substudy will receive the stable iron 
isotope 
57Fe orally (approximately 4 mg as ferrous sulfate ) on two occasions; once prior to 
starting PTG -300 (i.e., after the phlebotomy perfo rmed during the Screening period, Iron 
Absorption A), and a second dose after 4 to 6 weeks after starting PTG -300 (i.e., post- treatment; 
Iron Absorption B).  The post -treatment Iron Absorption B administration will occur 
approximately [ADDRESS_808862] 
for approximately 4 hours after the 57Fe do se. Blood samples will be collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 
24 hours for measurement of 57Fe levels  and for measurement of iron parameters —serum iron, 
serum ferritin, transferrin, and TSA T. Additional blood samples wi ll be obtained at 0, 4, 8, 12, 
and [ADDRESS_808863] 12 hours, after which subjects may stay overnight or be discharged 
home (at the discretion of the subject and investigator) and return the next day (approximately 
24 hours following 57Fe administration).  
7.1.4. Post-Treatment / Early Termination Safety Follow-Up (Week 29) 
Subjects w ho complete the treatment or who discontinue treatment early will undergo Visit 8/end 
of treatment (EOT) assessments as well as f ollow-up safety evaluations approximately [ADDRESS_808864] dose of study drug (Visit 9/end of study [EOS]). 
7.2. Safety 
Safety will be monitored carefully throughout the study. 
Safety measures ( including but not limited to physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests , 
complete blood count [ CBC], vital signs, electrocardiograms [ ECGs ], adverse event monitoring 
[AEs], and concom itant medications) will be evaluated and recorded over the course of the study 
according to the schedule of assessments ( Table 2 ). Clinical sites may co nduct local laboratory 
tests if required by [CONTACT_100412]. 
Any AE that emerges from the time th e subject signs an informed consent form (ICF) until Study 
Exit will be recorded and reported. Safety will be assessed using National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v5.[ADDRESS_808865] Therapeutics, Inc.

phlebotomy level at Screening. 
12.1.2. Iron Absorption (Iron Absorption Substudy)  
Subjects consenting to participate in the iron absorption substudy will have their iron absorption 
meas ured at two time points, pre- treatment with P TG-300 (Iron Absorption A) and after 
approximately 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with PTG -300 (Iron Absorption B). The purpose of the 
iron absorption substudy is to quantify the absorption of iron, marked by [CONTACT_941] 
57Fe isotope and the 
effect of PTG -300 on absorption of iron following oral dosing. 
12.2. Quality of Life Instruments  
12.2.1. Medical Outcome Study Questionnaire Short Form Health Survey (SF -36) 
The Medical Outcome Study Questionnaire Short Form Health Survey (SF-36;  Appendix 3) is a 
36-item short- form (SF -36) questionnaire constructed to survey health st atus in the Medical 
Outcomes Study (MOS) ( Ware 1992 ). The SF -36 includes one multi- item scale that assesses  
eight health concepts: 1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health 
(psychological distress and well- being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because of 
emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions. 
12.2.2. Patient Global Impression of Change ( PGI-C) 
Patient Global Impression of Change ( PGI-C; Appendix 4) is a self -report measure that reflects a 
patient ’s belief about the efficacy of treatment.  The patient will compare his/her condition from 
the start of the study on a 7-point scale ranging from “Very much worse” (1) to “Very much

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  43 of 67 14. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
14.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_89944]:  
• ECGs , clinical laboratory tests  including CBC ( Appendix 1),  and physical 
examinations findings (including vital signs). 
• Adverse events and concomitant medications will be evaluated throughout the course 
of the study. 
• Adverse events of interest will be assessed and reported separately and include the following: hematological toxicity >  Grade 3 ( CTCAE criteria, Version 5.0). 
Vital signs  will include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] , and 
temperature. 
Electrocardiograms will include ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT, RR and QTcF. 
The specific timing of safety assessments is  presented in Table [ADDRESS_808912] signs the 
ICF until the completion of the safety follow -up/end of study visit. Treatment- emergent AEs and 
SAEs will be evaluated from study drug dosing until the end of study visit. 
14.2.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any event, side effect, or other untoward medical occurrence that occurs in conjunction 
with the u se of a medicinal product in humans, whether or not considered to have a causal 
relationship to this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (that could include a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product. An AE may include an increase in severity of a pre-existing condition 
included in a subject’s medical history, and symptoms or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose. “Lack of efficacy” per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs 
and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they 
fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on the signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented 
as the AE (and SAE if serious) and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity of an Adverse Event  
Severity of adverse events will be assessed and reported following CTCAE Version 5.0 criteria  
(National Cancer Institute 2010). Severity of adverse events that do not match CTCAE criteria 
will be assessed as follows:  
• Mild  (Grade 1) : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated  
Protocol Number PTG-300-[ADDRESS_808913] Therapeutics, Inc. 
Protocol Amendment 3 – 14 September  2020 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  44 of 67 • Moderate (Grade 2) : discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
• Severe (Grade 3) : incapacitating with inability  to work or do usual activity 
• Life-threatening  (Grade 4) : could reasonably lead to death without medical 
intervention 
• Fatal (Grade 5)  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship of an Adverse Event to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the relationship between study drug and the occurrence of each AE. 
The investigator’s assessment of the relationship of each AE to study drug will be recorded in the 
source documents and the CRF. Alternative causes, such as medical history, concomitant 
therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study drug should be considered and investigated, if appropriate. The following definitions are general guidelines to help assign grade of attribution:  
• Not related:  The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the subject. This is especially so when an event occurs prior to the commencement of treatment  with 
the study drug. 
• Unlikely:  The event was most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or a concomitant drug administered to the subject and does not follow a known response to the study drug. 
• Possibl y: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study 
drug administration or follows a known response to the study drug but could have 
been produced by [CONTACT_1605]'s clinical state, other therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs administered to the subject. 
• Related : The temporal relationship is compelling between the administration of the 
study drug and the AE cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Action Taken with Study Medications  
Action taken with study medications will be recorded on the AE CRF page, as follows, regardless if a particular category is possible or not in this study: 
• Dose Increased  
• Dose Not Changed 
• Dose Reduced  
• Dose Interrupted  
• Dose Withdrawn  
• Not Applicable 
• Unknown

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  45 of 67 [IP_ADDRESS]. Outcome of an Adverse Event  
Outcome of an AE will be recorded on the AE CRF as follows: 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
• Not Recovered/Not Resolving 
• Fatal  
• Unknown 
14.2.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that are not one of the above may be considered to be SAEs by [CONTACT_32845], based upon appropriate medical judgement, they are considered to be 
clinically sig nificant and may jeopardize the subject, or when medical or surgical intervention 
may be required to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
An AE is considered “life-threatening” if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_609987], 
its occurren ce places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity, 
whereas ser iousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  14.2.2. An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 
14.2.3. Pregnancy  
The Investigator must report to the Sponsor any pregnancy occurring in a study subject (or 
subject’s partner) during the subject’s participation. The report should be submitted within the same timelines as an SAE, although a pregnancy per se is not considered an SAE unless the birth 
results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_609988] a contraceptive medication or method. Spontaneous miscarriages  should also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without 
complications should not be handled as AEs. 
A pregnancy should be followed-up until reporting of the pregnancy’s outcome and the birth 
date.

Protocol Amendment 3 – 14 September  2020 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  46 of 67 As information is available, a pregnancy diagnosed during the study will be reported 
immediately to the Investigator and Sponsor (or designee), including pregnancy in female 
partners of male subjects. The pregnancy will be followed to term or outcome and this outcome will be reported to the Sponsor. 
14.2.4. Other Safety Parameters and Related Information 
Additional safety parameters (laboratory tests  including CBC, 12-lead ECGs, physical 
examinations, and vital signs) and concomitant medications are collected as shown in the 
Schedules of Assessments in Table 2. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Appendix 1. 
Abnormal findings, other than pharmacodynamic markers, that are deemed clinically significant 
or are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as AEs (or recorded as an SAE if they meet the criteria of being serious) as described previously. 
The Investigator should exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Usually, the abnormality should be associated with a clinically evident sign or symptom. 
A clinically significant laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms 
may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent immediate consequences. For example, a markedly low serum glucose concentration may not be accompanied by [CONTACT_39597], yet be of a magnitude to require glucose administration to prevent such sequelae. 
14.3. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_610005]’s normal clinical practice and on the AE page of the case report 
form (CRF). SAEs that occur during the study must be documented in the subject’s medica l 
record, in the AE CRF, and on the SAE form. 
If there is evidence of an AE or SAE through report or observation, the Investigator or designee 
will evaluate further and record the following information: 
• Time of onset and resolution 
• Severity  
• Causality/relation to study treatment 
• Action taken regarding study drug 
• Outcome 
14.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
Adverse Events : All AEs, regardless of their relationship to PTG-300, will be reported on the 
AE Case Report Form. In order to ensure timely safety oversight of the trial, AEs should be reported routinely. All reports should include time of onset and resolution, severity ( see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), relationship to PTG-300, action taken regarding PTG-[ADDRESS_808916] Therapeutics, Inc. 
Protocol Amendment 3 – 14 September  2020 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  47 of 67 SAEs : In order to meet the requirements for expedited reporting of SAEs to applicable 
regulatory authorities and IRBs, all SAEs, must be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_808917] is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain events. It is the Princi pal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB  or IEC of all SAEs that occur at his 
or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug-related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical trial. Each s ite is responsible for notifying its 
IRB or IEC of these additional SAEs. 
14.5. Follow- Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs that are deemed possibly related or probably related to PTG -[ADDRESS_808918] to follow -up. The Investigator is responsible to ensure that follow-
up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate as completely as practical the nature and/or causality of the AE/SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, the 
Sponsor should be provided with a copy of any post-mortem findings, including histopathology.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  48 of 67 15. STATISTICS  
Summary statistics for all efficacy, safety, and PK/PD data, along with the estimation of 
PTG -300's treatment effect, will be provided. A detailed s tatistical analysis plan (SAP) will be 
prepared prior to performing any analysis. In case of differences between the protocol and the 
SAP, the SAP  will take precedence. 
15.1. Study Design and Sample Size Estimation  
This is a multicenter, single- arm, open-label study. 
This trial is exploratory and no rigid criteria for sample size are pre -specified. The choices are 
based on risk/benefit assessment of accumulating results. However, there will be at least 80% 
power for a sample size of [ADDRESS_808920] a 50% reduction in the number of phlebotomies from baseline. The power calculation is based on a hypothesized effect size of 0.5 (mean change = 1, with SD = 2) over [ADDRESS_808921] at  alpha=10% level. Twenty -
eight (28) subjects will be enrolled in the study, assuming an approximate 25% dropout. 
15.2. Demographics/Baseline Comparability  
The demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_10609], with and without 
the iron absorption substudy, respectively,  and overall using descriptive statistics. Demographics 
information includes age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Baseline dis ease characteristics will be 
included if necessary . 
15.3. Data Presentation  
Serum chemistries and measurements related to iron studies will be obtained at the clinical site  
and/or at a central laboratory. The central laboratory value will be used for data presentation and 
study endpoints. The clinical laboratory value may be used for clinical decision making. 
15.4. Definition of Baseline  
For the phlebotomy frequency, the subjects’ pre-study phlebotomy history will serve as the baseline. For serum ferritin and TSAT, measurements obtained during the screening period will serve as the baseline.  
15.5. Analysis of Efficacy Data  
Efficacy data will be analyzed for all the subjects included in the Intent- to-Treat Analysis Set 
defined below. 
In general, continuous endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_262309] (mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). Categorical endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_22977].  
Hypothesis testing will be performed by [CONTACT_941] t-test for each of the change from baseline endpoints listed below to evaluate if the change is signif icantly different from zero. P-value will not be 
adjusted for multiple comparisons since this is an early phase safety and proof of concept study. In addition, the point estimate (i.e., mean and/or median) and the confidence interval associated

Protocol Amendment 3 – [ADDRESS_808923] 
phlebotomy data.  
Data collected for subjects electing to participate in the iron absorption substudy will be analyzed 
separately in addition to the analyses for all the Intent- to-Treat subjects. Serum iron, 57Fe, TSAT , 
serum ferritin, sTfR, and transferrin pertaining to the iron absorption substudy will be analyzed for the subgroup as defined as Iron Absorption analysis set below.  
15.6. Analysis Populations

The Iron Absorption (IA ) Analysis Set will include all ITT subjects who complete Iron 
Absorption B. 
15.7. Handling of Missing Data  
Missing data will not be imputed for calculation of mean changes and other quantitative analyses since the aim for those analyses is to estimate mean changes and other quantitative outcomes in subjects who remain on treatment. Missing data are assumed missing at random for subjects remaining on treatment at each respective time point.  
15.8. Analysis of Safety  
The safety analysis will include all subjects who receive any amount of study medication. 
Reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
All AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_610006], for AEs any time during the study. The severity, seriousness, and 
relationship to study medic ation will also be summarized in a similar manner . Each AE (based 
on preferred term) is counted once for a given subject. If the same AE occurred on multiple occasions, the highest severity and least complimentary relationship will be assumed. 
The incidenc e of TEAEs and SAEs will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_610007], 
respectively . 
Additionally, laboratory test data, physical examinations, vital signs, and ECGs  will be 
summarized overall and by [CONTACT_610007], respectively.

2 Protocol Summary  
Title:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63102] 
(MILO)  
Population:  Caregivers (age 18 or older) of individuals ages 15 -35 experiencing 
early course psychotic disorders; N = 100 
Intervention:  Motivational Interviewing for Loved Ones, “MILO”  
MILO consists of four  60-minute sessions of communication skills 
training  delivered by a trained provider in person o r via secure 
telehealth  
Objectives : Evaluate the effectiveness of MILO for (1) facilitating the 
engagement of IP with evidence -based treatments and (2) reducing 
distress among PCSO  
Design /Methodology : Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive MILO (50%) 
or the waitlist condition (50%)  as a partial cross -over design.  
Total Study Duration:  3/1/21 -7/31/[ADDRESS_67967] Participation Duration:  Four to six months , depending on whether participant is assigned to 
immediate intervention vs. waitlist condition as well as the pace  
 
3 Background /Rationale  & Purpose  
 
3.[ADDRESS_67968] Epi[INVESTIGATOR_63104] (FEP) often represents a time of crisis for young people and their families. Since 
peak onset occurs during late adolescence and early adulthood, the onset of serious mental health 
challenges can disrupt plans for education, relationships, and other milestones of independence. 
Although some psychoses are brief and self -limiting, more often these symptoms portend a potentially 
chronic and disabling psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia. FEP can also be acutely dangerous: 
youth with FEP are far more likely to die in the year following their diagnosis re lative to the general 
population of 16 -30-year old’s in the [LOCATION_002]. Approximately 100,000 youth in the [LOCATION_002] 
experience FEP every year. Young people identified by [CONTACT_63129]. A review of privately insured adolescents and 
young adults in the US showed that 62% of young people in the US with FEP filled no outpatient 
prescriptions, and 41% received no outpatient psychotherapy, in the year following their ind ex 
diagnosis.  Among those who do have an initial encounter with specialized FEP outpatient care, high 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63102] (MILO)   Version 1 3.2.21  
 
Page 4 of 18 attrition is a common problem, with 30% of individuals initially enrolled in first epi[INVESTIGATOR_63105].  
 
Many individuals experiencing psychosis are reluctant to seek mental health treatment due to lack of 
insight and fear of psychiatric interventions. Young adults may be torn between distress and 
dissatisfaction relating to their symptoms and functioning, an d mistrust of mental health providers and 
irritation with their parents’ concern. Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques are designed to elicit 
this ambivalence through nonjudgmental listening, so that discrepancies between current behaviors and 
ideal o utcomes can be explored. Clinician -delivered MI has been identified as effective for enhancing 
adherence once individuals with psychosis are involved in care, and MI may also be useful for engaging 
those who are not yet interested in treatment. Several stu dies have found positive results in training 
and deploying non -professionals to use MI to influence others’ health behaviors. MI training for parents 
and concerned significant others (PCSO) is a promising venue through which PCSO can specifically 
influence  their loved one’s decision to seek care and adhere to treatment plans.  
 
The PI ( [CONTACT_63144] ) has developed a brief 4 -5 session training course for caregivers called “motivational 
interviewing for loved ones” (MILO). Each training session lasts 45 -60 minutes  and consists of teaching 
the participant a n MI based communication skill, reviewing previously discussed skills, or offering 
referral information for treatment for their IP. The training can be done in -person or virtually. In a 
feasibility focused pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], the intervention was found to be highly valued by [CONTACT_4317], with 94% of 
consented participants completing at least three sessions. This application represents the continuation 
of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_63106] l Center and which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_63107].  
 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, applicable regulatory requirements, and 
BMC/BU Medical Campus Human Research Protection policies and procedures.  
 
3.2 Rationale  and Purpose  
 
MILO aims to address the critical problem of delayed treatment and under -treatment in early course 
psychosis by [CONTACT_14659] a motivational interviewing (MI) based skills intervention for parents or other 
concerned significant others (PCSO) of individuals with psychosis (IP) who refuse treatment. This 
intervention will offer psychoeducation and concrete skills for communicating with the IP about the 
potential benefits of seeking care. The primary aim of the intervention is to increase the likelihood of IP 
engaging with evidence -based treatment. Secondary outcomes include reductions in PCSO distress and 
increases in PCSO well -being.  
 
4 Objectives  
 
4.1 Study Objectives  
 
The initial aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_63108]. The secondary aims 
are to evaluate the effectiveness of MILO for ( a) facilitating the engagement of IP with evidence -
based treatments and ( b) reducing distress among PCSO. We hypothesize that the intervention 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63102] (MILO)   Version 1 3.2.21  
 
Page 5 of 18 will be superior to control condition for both enhancing IP engagement with mental health 
services and reducing PCSO distress.  
 
 
4.2 Study Outcome Measures  
 
4.2.1 Primary Outcome Measure s 
 
Feasibility  will be analyzed using the following descriptive metrics: # participants screened; # 
Eligible; # Enrolled; # not enrolled and corresponding reasoning; # Meeting DSM -5 Adjustment 
Disorder criteria; Percentage of study  sessions completed; study  Satisfaction ; % assessments 
completed; Duration of assessments . A demographics questionnaire, a clinician -administered 
assessment containing information relevant to the DSM -5 diagnosis of adjustment disorder, and 
the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire will be used.

5 Study Design  
 
The study population is parents and concerned significant others (PCSO) of individuals 
experiencing psychosis (IP) who are not currently engaged with treatment. The IP has to have a 
recent onset of psychosis within the past [ADDRESS_67970] 
condition control arm. Participants  will be randomly assigned to either receive MILO (50%) or the 
waitlist condition (50%)  in a cross over design.   
 
The study is designed to minimize participant burden. Concerns about the ethics of 
randomization are allayed by [CONTACT_63130] (effectiveness is not proven), and that the 
control condition represents treatment as usual. Thus the risk benefit ratio, even for those 
assigned to “treatment as usual /waitlist”, is favorable given that typi[INVESTIGATOR_63109]/significant others attempting to connect their loved one 
with care. Phase 1 of the study was completed at its initial site at Beth Israel Deaconess Me dical 
Center. Phase 2 was also started at the previous sight and will be completed at [LOCATION_011] Medical 
Center.  
 
We will be collecting data through REDCap surveys administered via email link to the 
participants. Those assigned to the MILO treatment condition will be assessed at 4 time points 
(study entry, post intervention, 8 week follow up, 12 week follow up). Those in the waitlist condition 
will be assessed at 5 time points (study entry, end of waitlist, post intervention, 8 week follow up, 
12 week follow up ). Please see the following measures:

6 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
6.1 Risks  
 
Potential risks to PCSO participating in MILO include: 1) There is a potential risk that confidential 
health information collected during the course of the study may be disclosed to others. 2) 
Participating PCSO may at times feel inconvenienced by [CONTACT_63131]/or research assessments. 3) Participants may experience frustration or anxiety in 
learning to use the motivational interviewing communication skills. They may experience sadness 
or discomfort when discussing personal problems or in interacting with a family member. 
Discussing or experiencing the IP’s psychiatric problems may be upsetting to the family. 4) There 
is a potential risk that participants will be subjected to stigma or und ue anxiety from identification 
with the study. 5) The individuals with psychosis will be discussed in detail during study sessions. 
These individuals might find it distressing to know that their circumstances are the topic of their 
loved ones’ research par ticipation.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_63110]:

Page 8 of 18 1) Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_19917] a study number, and 
coding all data collected with that number. Identifying information and study data will be 
stored separately on secure BMC servers. To protect the confidentiality of the I P being 
discussed, his/her name [CONTACT_63142]. All computer databases will 
be password protected, and hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_63111]. All study personnel will be certified to conduct researc h with human 
subjects and will be aware of the importance of maintaining strict confidentiality. Audio 
recordings of participants will be saved in digital files on a secure BMC server. Audio files 
will be destroyed at the conclusion of the study unless exp licit consent to use audio files 
(e.g. for training purposes) is obtained from participants.  
 
2) The assessment battery has been designed to minimize participant burden.  
 
3) The study PI [CONTACT_832] a very experienced clinician and will provide ongoing supervision to eac h 
individual working on the protocol to ensure that they are equipped to provide appropriate 
support when necessary and to recognize signs of distress and discomfort . It is not 
expected that participants will feel any more sadness or discomfort talking abo ut personal 
problems or interacting with a family member than they would at home or if they took part 
in psychotherapy in the community. If participants or family members experience 
frustration or distress, the PI, will offer participants emotional support  and validation. She 
will also offer strategies for managing the situation and accompanying emotional 
responses. Participants will also be informed that they can receive and follow -up on 
outside referrals for counseling outside of the study at any time wit hout being dropped 
from the protocol.  
 
 
4) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_63112]. Study participants who are 
judged by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_63113]/treatment or medical consultation will be referred as clinically indicated. This 
includes endorsement of self -harm and suicidality which will be addressed immediately. 
The participants will be frequently asked whether they desire additional referral or 
consultation for their own or their loved one’s safety. If imminent danger is reported, 
participants will develop a safety plan with [CONTACT_63145] as described below.  
 
5) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_63114]. Staff will be 
trained to recognize signs of di stress (for instance, hopeless statements) and will report 
to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_63115]. If needed, study staff will provide  crisis intervention, 
recommendati ons or referrals for adjunctive medical/pharmacological interventions, and 
when necessary, referral to emergency or inpatient treatment facilities. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_63116]. Staff  will seek written release  to 
coordinate care with other mental health providers prior to the start of treatment to avoid 
need for acute care when increased outpatient supports may be sufficiently garnered. 
Participants will be told they may decline to answer any questions or parti cipate in any 
component. Staff will make the study assessments and MILO sessions as pleasant as 
possible by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_63117] .  
6) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_63118] a result of the study. However, first epi[INVESTIGATOR_63119]. Any safety con cerns 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63102] (MILO)   Version 1 3.2.21  
 
Page 9 of 18 relating to either the PCSO’s or IP’s wellbeing will be carefully discussed with the 
participant. Whenever reason for concern arises, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_63120] a plan in collaboration with the participat ing PCSO to 
address such risk. This could involve calling [ADDRESS_67972] that rates of illness complications will be higher if the parents or 
significant others of IP participate in the study.  
7) Risks to subjects will be closely monitored as described in Section 6.1.  Adverse events will be 
documented and reported per BMC/BUMC HRPP policies.  Any event or set of events meeting the 
definition of Unanticipated Problem (UP) will be reported in an expedited  timeframe (within 7 days) of the 
study team learning of the UP.  
8) Staff will maintain regular contact [CONTACT_63132], consents, 
recruitment materials, and human subject protection plan.  
 
 
 
6.2 Potential Benefits  
 
If it is effective, the intervention has tremendous upside to both participants and their love d ones 
with psychosis. The goals of the intervention are to shorten DUP, increase service utilization by 
[CONTACT_33249], and reduce caregiver distress.  These parents and other loved ones are often desperate to 
seek help on behalf of the IP. Learning MI skills may benefit participants by [CONTACT_63133], 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_63121], and giving them information about 
how they can better facilitate the IP’s connection or adherence to treatment.  
 
Those randomized to the waitlist w ill be offered  a 30-minute consultation during which the PCSO 
is provided with information about treatment options (e.g., community mental health and FEP 
coordinated specialty care programs) and contact [CONTACT_63134]/her area. This will be done in perso n or by [CONTACT_756].  This consultation represents the 
minimum standard of care for caregivers of individuals with recent -onset psychosis being treated 
at BMC . Additionally, waitlist participants will have the opportunity to re ceive MILO training after 
a six-week wait.  
 
Concerns about the ethics of randomization are allayed by [CONTACT_63130] 
(effectiveness is not proven), and that waitlisted participants will also be offered the MILO 
intervention after a short waitin g period .  
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_67973]. There are no manipulations 
of drug treatments. Pharmacotherapy is not required and if participants opt for it, they will be 
referred to a ppropriate providers. Thus the risk benefit ratio, even for those assigned to “waitlist ”, 
is favorable.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63102] (MILO)   Version [ADDRESS_67974] meet all of the following criteria:  
• PCSO is 18 years or older  
• PCSO is able to communicate in English  
• PCSO is a primary care giver or an individual who has ≥[ADDRESS_67975] 
with an IP  
• PCSO is able to provide informed consent  by [CONTACT_63135], study staff  will establish via 
the participating PCSO that the individual with psychosis is : 
• Aged 15 -35 
• Has bee n diagnosed with a DSM -5 psychotic disorder by a health 
professional, OR has clearly observable (by [CONTACT_63136]) symptoms/behaviors 
indicating psychosis  
• Experienced onset of observed symptoms or first psychosis diagnosis 
occurred within past five years  
• Is not  optimally  engaged in outpatient treatment  
Identifiable information about the individual with psychosis is not kept in study records. The 
information gathered about the IP is based on participants ’ reporting and perceptions.  
 
 
 
Subject Exclusion Criteria  
 
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:  
• Current mental health crisis: if study staff determine that the potential participant is in serious 
emotional distress during the eligibility  determination and consent process, staff will consult 
with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_63122]  
 
8 Study Intervention  
The active  intervention includes four to five  45-60 minute sessions. Sessions will be conducted 
individually with the clinician, or if two or more PCSO (e.g., parents) wish to participate together, 
they will meet at the same time with the clinician. The first two sessions will focus prima rily on 
teaching through concept review, demonstration, and role play. In the third and fourth sessions, 
the clinician will learn about PCSOs’ efforts to initiate a conversation about treatment with the IP 
using, and will provide feedback, problem -solving,  and encouragement regarding the PCSO’s 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63102] (MILO)   Version [ADDRESS_67976] to provide additional coaching, consultation, 
and psychoeducation relevant to MILO topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].  See Table 1 for details about session content.   
 
Session  Content  
1 Participants talk with a study clinician about the IP’s illness history and how the 
experience has impacted them and their family. Treatment and psychoeducational 
resources are offered (e.g. NAMI support groups). Study staff teach participants a bout 
the philosophy of motivational interviewing and the potential value of listening and 
asking questions instead of giving advice or solving the problem.  
2-3 Study staff teach participants core MILO communication skills (reflections, questions, 
asking p ermission before offering advice) and practice the skills during the session.  
4-5 (5th 
session 
optional 
depending 
on 
participants’ 
preference)  Participants review their attempts to use MILO skills with the IP and receive feedback 
and encouragement from M ILO clinicians. Participants have the opportunity to role 
play with the clinician to obtain additional practice.  
 
 
The waitlist condition offers a one -time consultation session to participants while they are on a [ADDRESS_67977]  Potential participant contacts study staff via 
email or phone communication. This is a 
dedicated study phone number. Study staff 
schedule a 10 minute phone call with potential

pre-screen.  
Pre-Screen  Study Staff confirm that potential participant is 
interested in learning more, reads the Consent to 
Phone Screen, asks eligibility criteria questions   
Eligibility Determination  Study staff review the answers to the eligibility 
questions, if any answer is unknown or needs 
clinical input, study staff contacts the Principal

MILO Treatment  Participants randomized to immediate MILO , as 
well as  those who have already finished the 
waitlist period, are scheduled for their first  MILO 
training  session.  Sessions are offered via a 
secure telehealth platform,  HIPAA compliant 
Zoom  or in person if the participant does not 
have access to appropriate technology . All in 
person operations will  follow BMC’s COVID 
procedures.  Sessions are 45 -60 minutes and 
participants are offered 4 -5 sessions. All sessions 
are conducted by [CONTACT_3665]. Study staff 
receive weekly individual supervision from the PI.

9.1 Definitions  
The following definitions will be used in the assessment of safety:  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any 
abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered 
related to the subject’s particip ation in the research.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any adverse event that  
(1) Invasion of privacy  
(2) Breach in confidentiality  
(3) Breach in the protection of participant data  
(4) Any abnormal or harmful behaviors  
 
Unanticipated Problem  is defined as an event, experience or outcome that meets all three  of the 
following criteria:  
• is unexpected ; AND  
• is related or possibly related  to participation in the research; AND  
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk  of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Possibly related  means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_51408], severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with either:  
• the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the 
research that are described in (a) the protocol –related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed 
consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and 
package inserts; or  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63102] (MILO)   Version 1 3.2.21  
 
Page 14 of 18 • the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the 
subject(s) experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the 
adverse event.  
 
9.2 Safety Review  
 
Both the risks li sted in Section 4.1 and unknown risks will be monitored as follows:  
Study staff who are meeting with participants will participate in weekly supervision with the PI. Staff are 
trained to identify signs of acute participants’  distress and potential suicida lity. Via direct observation or 
supervision, t he PI [INVESTIGATOR_63123]. Any and all adverse events will be reported to the IRB. Any adverse events 
will be evalua ted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_63124] a licensed PHD psychologist in accordance to IRB requirements and 
changes will be made to the protocol to prevent future adverse events if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_63137]/or the IRB.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_63125] d/or her department chair [CONTACT_63146] if she has any question about whether  to report an event to the IRB immediately or during 
annual review.  
 
 
9.3 Reporting Plans  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_51398]/BU Medical Campus will report Unanticipated Problems, safety 
monitors’ reports, and Adverse Events to the BMC/BU Medical Center IRB in accordance with IRB 
policies:  
• Unanticipated Problems occurring at BMC/BU Medical Campus will be reported to the IRB within 7 
days of the investigator learning of the  event.  
• Reports from safety monitors with recommended changes will be reported to the IRB within 7 
days of the investigator receiving the report.  
• Adverse Events (including Serious Adverse Events) will be reported in summary at the time of 
continuing revie w, along with a statement that the pattern of adverse events, in total, does not 
suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously 
known.  
• Reports from safety monitors with no recommended changes will be repor ted to the IRB at the 
time of continuing review.  
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_67981] will be withdrawn from the study if adverse event(s) occur that per the PI’s judgment require  
subject withdrawal.  Example s would be a participant who endorses suicidal ideation  or reports a violent 
altercation with the IP.  
 
There are no specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].

Study monitor s or other authorized representatives of the sponsor (i.e. NIMH) may inspect all 
documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, 
medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records f or the subjects in this study. The 
clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
 
The study is registered and regularly updated on clinical trials.gov, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] . 
  
 
10.2 Source Documents  
 
Source data and source documents will be stored on BMC secure servers. They include study team 
administrative  notes, study clinician notes and progress checklists, recorded data from automated 
instruments including REDCap, audio files and audio transcripti on documents.  Data generated by [CONTACT_63139]' study progress notes.

10.4 Study Records Retention  
 
All records will be saved on BMC’s secure servers electronically  and retained at least seven years after 
completion of the study . At the completion of the study, any paper notes will be scanned and uploaded 
as electronic documents to the BMC server. Within the informed consent process, participants indicate 
whether their audio recordings can be used for  research and  teaching purposes.  Examples on how they 
may be used include during training new study staff on the measure or used as an example during a 
research presentation.  Audio recordings of participants who say that their recordings can be used will be 
retained and others will be de leted at the end of the study. Any identifying information disclosed within 
the audio files will be removed  by [CONTACT_63141] , the files themselves are de -identified . 
 
11 Statistical Plan 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63102] (MILO)   Version [ADDRESS_67985] (e.g., proficiency using MILO skills, 
confidence, stress, caregiving attitudes , and caregiver -reported IP treatment engagement ).  
 
3. Participants attending MILO sessions will show more improvement with regard to outcomes of 
interest within the first six weeks of study participation relative to those on the waitlist.  
 
4. After attending MILO sessions, waitlisted participants will “catch up” to those randomized to 
receive the intervention immediately with regard to changes on outcomes of interest.  
 
5. Gains in MI proficiency as demonstrated via scored audio recordings will mediate the impact of 
the intervention on other outcomes such as reduced conflict and stress and increased 
confidence and caregiver -reported IP treatment engagement.  
 
 
11.2 Sample Size Determination  
 
The overall target for recruitment is 100 participants. 52 participants  will be recruited for the protocol 
once appro ved by  [CONTACT_51406] (48 participants were recruited at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center which 
was the original recipi[INVESTIGATOR_63126] K23 funding support) . This study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_63127]. Alth ough true “pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]” studies focus an on 
intervention’s feasibility, rather than effects per se, the current study  reflects a two -phase hybrid of 
priorities balancing the need to focus on feasibility while also investigating whether the intervention 
impacts t he hypothesized treatment targets (MI skills, self -efficacy) and whether it is more effective in 
achieving the primary outcome (IP engagement in FEP treatment) than a control condition representing 
“treatment as usual” and a waiting period. The control gro up will be small relative to the active 
treatment group, thus maximizing the feasibility -focused sample. Thus the study may be somewhat  
underpowered to detect statistically significant effects, but has been designed to yield high quality 
feasibility metric s, highlight important factors for implementation, and provide a rough estimate of 
effect size that will inform a later, fully powered RCT.  
 
11.3 Statistical Methods  
 
Feasibility  will be analyzed using the following descriptive metrics: # participants screened; # 
Eligible; # Enrolled;  # not enrolled and corresponding reasoning  # Meeting DSM -5 Adjustment 
Disorder criteria; Percentage of Treatment sessions completed; Treatment Satis faction; % 
assessments completed; Duration of assessments.  
 
The outcome s of interest will be compared between the intervention and waitlist groups, and 
also within the waitlist group (comparing the pre -post intervention changes to the pre -post 
waitlist time changes.  Prevalence of IP treatment seeking in each group will also be analyzed 
via odds ratios. Secondary outcomes, i.e. changes in PCSO distress and quality of life, will be

hypothesized mediators of effects (MI skill proficiency and self -efficacy) will be examined via 
repeated measures ANOVAs examining group -by-time changes. Analyses will be conducted 
using SPSS software.  
 
12 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects  
 
This study is to be conducted according to applicable US federal regulations and i nstitutional policies 
(which are based in federal regulation s, guidance, and ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines ). 
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to the [LOCATION_011] Medical Center and [LOCATION_011] 
University Medical Campus IRB , for formal approval of the study conduct. The decision of the IRB 
concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator . A copy of the initial IRB 
approval letter  will be provided to the sponsor before commencement of this study .  
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a  consent form describing this study and providing sufficient 
information for subjects to make an informed decision about thei r participation in this study. The 
consent form will be submitted with the protoc ol for review and approval by [CONTACT_1201] . The consent of a 
subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject is sub mitted to any 
study procedure. Consent will be documented as required by [CONTACT_1201].

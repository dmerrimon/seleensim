Background  
Primary aldosteronism  (PA)  is the excessive endoge nous production of the 
mineralocorticoid aldosterone1. Although various rare forms of PA exist, the vast majority 
of cases are accounted by [CONTACT_392085] -producing  adenoma (APA) or bilateral 
adrenal hyperplasia, also described as idiopathic hyperaldosteronism  (IHA)2, 3. During the 
last decades the prevalence of PA has  risen, predominantly due to better awareness of 
disease . Several  studies esti mated  a prevalence  of PA up to 17% in an unselected 
population of hypertensive patients . However, in a population with resistant hypertension 
the reporte d prevalence is even higher: 17 -23%. This emphasiz es the clinical impact of PA  
on morbidity and mortality due to high blood pressure4-7. Since both hypertension and 
aldosteronism  are independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity, the aim  of 
treatment is curation or reduction  of both8.     
After an adrenalectomy for APA normalization of biochemical abnormalities is achieved in 
almost all cases. Nevertheless , curation  of hypertension (SBP <140 and DBP <90 mmHg) 
without the need of antihypertensive medication is accomplished in only 35 -45% of the 
cases9-11. In 200 8 Zarnegar et al . developed the Aldosteron oma Resolution Score  (ARS) . 
This score predict s the likelihood of complete resolution of the hypertension in patients 
with an aldosteronoma  and has been validated by  [CONTACT_2312]9-11. 
Reduction  of hypertension is also an important clinical outcome  and is reported in 90-98% 
of the patients after surgery9-11. In most studies reduction is defined  as a certain  decrease  
in blood pressure or antihypertensive medicati on. However, there is no consensus on the 
precise definition of reduction in these patients, which leads to incomparable results. Up 
until now only one study has analyzed the characteristics predicting clinical ly relevant  
reduction  of hypertension12. In a st udy by [CONTACT_392086] . reduction  was defined as: reduction 
of the numbe r of antihypertensive drugs  ≥ 33% with a systolic blood pressure ≤ 130mm 
Hg. They  showed reduction  in 72% of the cases(n=58) . Preoperative systolic blood 
pressure and serum creatinine were significantly higher in patients showing no reduction  
of hypertension.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Objectives  
Although complete  resolution of hypertension is the primary goal of unilateral 
adrenalectomy, reduction of hypertension leads to  a lifelong  decrease  of cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality. Moreover, reduction of hypertension can lead to decrease of 
antihypertensive medication  and thereby [CONTACT_392087] . 
There fore , reduction  of hypertension is also a favorable result of adrenalectomy. The aim of 
the proposed study is to determine the proportion of patients with clinically relevant 
reduction of hypertension after adrenalectomy in a large cohort. Furthermore, we aim  to 
determine the characteristics predicting this clinical ly relevant reduction . Additionally , we 
evaluate  the predictive value of the  Aldosteronoma Resolution Score for clinical ly relevant 
reduction  and aim to develop a scoring system to help clinician s predict  the likelihood of  
reduction  of hypertension after adrenalectomy so it can be used for patient counseling .    
 
Definitions/ Outcome measures  
To evaluate differences between those  patients  who were cured  versus  who had reduction 
versus  who had no reduction , patients will be  stratified based  on clinical response to 
adrenalectomy. Definitions are based on both American and European guidelines for the 
management of hypertension13, 14 .  
Patients  who were complete ly off anti hypertensive drugs  and had a postopera tive systolic 
blood pressure < 140  mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg are considered as 
‘’resolution of hypertension ’’.  
‘’reduction  of hypertension ’’ is defined as : a decrease in the number of anti hypertensive 
drugs  for preoperative normotensive patients  (SBP  < 140 and DBP < 90 mm Hg ) or a 
decrease  of postoperative  blood pressure (SBP < 140 and DBP < 90 mm Hg ) with the same 
or less number  of antihypertensive drugs  for patients with preoperative resistant 
hypertension .  
Patients  who are not meeting these endpoints are stratified as ‘’no reduction of 
hypertension’’ . 
 
Research Design  
An international multicenter  retrospective cohort study .  
 
 
Inclusion Criteria  
1. Patients with biochemical evidence of primary aldosteronism who underwent 
adrenalecto my on account of an aldosteron e-producing adenoma(APA), proven by 
[CONTACT_392088](CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) or Adrenal 
Venous Sampling(AVS).  
2. Operated between [ADDRESS_492522] to 6 months after adrenal ectomy.  
 
Study Variables  
Patients demographics and preoperative disease characteristics will be  queried, including 
age at time  of operation, gender, history of cardiovascular events, BMI, mean preoperative 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure , preoperative number  of antihypertensive drugs , 
duration of hypertension , family history of hypertension , smoking, hypercholesterole mia, 
diabetes  and possible  supplementation of potassium. The ARS will be calculated  for each 
patient.  Furthermore, results of imaging and AVS will be  collected.  Laboratory data 
collected include serum aldosterone, potassium and creatinine levels and plasma renin 
activity. The aldosterone to renin ratio will be calculated . Also operative  characteristics 
(i.e., approach and tumor laterality) and pathologic diagnosis ( i.e., aldoster onoma  or 
hyperplasia and tumor size)  will be  reported.  
 
Study Outcomes  
The primary outcomes of this study are the postoperative mean systolic and  diastolic blood 
pressure and the number of antihypertensive drugs . Secondary outcomes are 
postoperative serum aldosterone and potassium levels . Both primary and secondary 
outcomes will be measured at approximately 6 months after adrenalectomy (range 3 -9 
months).  
 
Statistical analysis  
To determine characteristics predicting clinical ly relevant reduction  univariate analysis  
will be conducted  with Pearson’s chi -square test and Mann -Whitne y U test. A P value of < 
0.05 will be  considered statistically significant. Binary logistic regression mo deling will be  
carried out on variables demonstrating statistical significance in univariate analysis. A P 
value of < 0.05 will be  considered statistically significant. The predictive accu racy of the 
ARS for reduction of hypertension  will be reported  as the proportion of patients with 
reduction  in each likelihood level  of the ARS: low (ARS 0 -1), medium (ARS 2 -3), high (ARS 
4-5). When possible a new prediction model for reduction  of hyperten sion after 
adrenalectomy will be  developed by [CONTACT_392089].

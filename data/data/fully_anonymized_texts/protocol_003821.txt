 No secondary o bjective.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1. Study Disease  
Patients with thyroid nodules will be studied .  
 
2.2. Study Agent /Device /Imaging procedure  
 
Patients are not given a treatment or imaging agent. They are having a procedure - an 
Elastography  Ultrasound (experimental) as well as a standard of care ultrasound .  
 
 
2.3. Clinicaltrials.gov  
This investigation  does not require an Investigati onal New Drug application (IND) . 
 
2.4. Rationale  
 
Thyroid nodules are extremely common, affecting nearly half of the  adult population. 
Although extremely common, a minority, between 1.5  – 10% of thyroid nodules, are 
malignant. [1] Differentiation between  benign and malignant nodules however, based on 
phys ical examination  and ultrasound imaging is very difficult and generally is referred 
for invasive percutaneous biopsy or surgical excision for definitive  diagnosis.   
 
Because of the very common occurrence of thyroid nodules in the  general public, there is a  
great need for a noninvasive means of  stratifying those who are at greater risk of 
malignancy from those who  are more likely to harbor a benign nodule for which no treatment 
is necessary.   
 
Recent studies have examined elastography in thyroid nodules with  findings of high 
sensitivity and good specificity. [2] Other  investigators have looked at elastography in 
evaluation of other   [3] [4]  It is thought that lesions that are stiffer are more likely to  represent 
malignancy or other pathology than benign or no rmal tissue  which tend to be more softer.   
 
Elastography is a noninvasive ultrasound technology which can evaluate  the stiffness of a 
lesion compared to the background tissue. There are two major methods of measuring 
stiffness: strain imaging, and shear wave velocity measurement. In strain imaging, 
ultrasound maps the relative tissue deformity by [CONTACT_204334] a color 
map. Greater deformation with pr essure corresponds to more elastic tissue and less 
deformation corresponds to stiffer tissue. In the second method, shear waves are sent 
through a given volume of tissue and the speed of the shear wave propagation is measured. 
Since stiffer tissues have hi gher shear wave velocities, this can be correlated with tissue

Version # 1, Date  04/03/2017  Page 7 of 22 CONFIDENTIAL  stiffness to provide a more quantative measurement. Velocities can then be used to 
calculate Young modulus in kPa. [5] 
 
Most shear wave elastography measurements  currently available  use a singl e point 
measurement; however, a new [ADDRESS_243902] one point, which may be more representative of the 
nodule’s overall stiffness.  
 
 
 
2.5. Preliminary results  
Preliminary results show that the stiffness or elast ography values of malignant nodules tend to be 
greater than benign thyroid nodules.  
 
2.6. Study Design  
• Single Group  
 
• There will be one intervention arm  
 
• The study will be open: no masking is used  
 
• The study is not randomized  
 
 
3. PARTICIPANT SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES

4. IMAGING AGENT /DEVICE /PROCEDURE  INFORMATION  
 
4.1. Name [CONTACT_204345] /Device/Imaging Procedure  
 
No imaging agent will be used in this study.  
 
• The examination will consist of an ultrasound elastography assessment in which an 
ultrasound machine is used to evaluate elastography measurements of a thyroid 
nodule.  
• Each patient will undergo one ultrasound elastography assessment of the thyroid 
prior to either fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_204328] 
(invasive procedure is not part of the study)  
• No radiation will be used for this examination. Ultrasound is an imaging modality that 
uses sound waves, not radiation in imaging.  
• Ultrasound machines are FDA approved.

7.1. Potential Adverse Events  
There are no known side effects or adverse events from elastography. However, if any are   
detected, they will be reported.  
 
7.2. Adverse Event Reporting  
 
 No adverse events are expected to occur in this study.  
 
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4.0.  Both Serious and Non -Serious 
Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study specific  
Case Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will assess each 
Adverse Event (AE) to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed 
Consent, Protocol Document, or Investigator’s Brochure s, and related to the investigation . 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution  and [ADDRESS_243906] 
dose of the study treatment.  
 
8. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1. Institutional Review of Protocol  
 
 
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related 
to the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_204335] (SRC) .  Any changes made to the 
protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by [CONTACT_204336].  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment 
information to all participating investigators.  
 
8.2. Data Ma nagement Plan  
Data will be stored in Oncore and REDCap. Other data will be stored on a password 
protected and encrypted computer or on a HIPAA compliant server through Stanford, BOX.  
 
8.3. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
During the clinical investigation, the  Protocol Director will evaluate the progress of the trial, 
including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, 
accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, and other factors that can affect study 
outcome.  
 
The Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC ) will audit 
study  related activities at least annually in accordance with the DSMC SOP to determine 
whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard  
operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may 
include review of regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility checklists, and source 
documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse events a nd protocol 
deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of human subjects.  Results 
of DSMC audit s will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities 
at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.

Version # 1, Date  04/03/[ADDRESS_243907] velocity measurements of thyroid nodules (which are calculated 
by [CONTACT_204337]) will be compared 
to fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_204330], if applicable.  
 
9.3. Measurement Time Points  
Elastography shear wave velocity measurements of thyroid nodules will be compared to fine 
needle      aspi[INVESTIGATOR_204330], if applicable. No 
follow -up imaging or assessment will be required.  
 
9.4. Response Review  
No response review is planned.  
 
9.5. Secondary Outcome  
There is no secondary outcome.  
 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1.  Statistical Design  
This is a prospective single arm blinded study in which patients who come for biopsy or 
surgical resection will be analyzed with elastography prior to biopsy or surgical resection. A 
sample size of 10 vs 43 provide 80% power for detecting a difference of 0.84 m/sec  at the 
significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_243908] assuming that the sound velocity 
for benign (and malignant nodules) follows a Gaussian distribution ).  The standard deviation 
is 0.79  meters/second based on the observed standard deviation from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299].  
 
We propose to use Wilcoxon rank sum test for its robustness in cases where the velocity does 
not follow the Gaussian distribution. Even if the Gaussian assumption is true, the Wilcoxon 
rank sum test is almost as powerful as the param etric t -test.  
 
Randomization  
Patients are not randomized in this study.  
 
10.2.  Interim analyses  
There will not be a statistical stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. Every three months, the data collected will be 
analyzed and a record of the monitoring activities wil be maintained by  [CONTACT_3476].  
 
10.3.  Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis  
 The distribution of the elastography measurements will be summarized by [CONTACT_204338]. If the distribution is highly non -Gaussian, then median and other 
quantiles  will be provided as well.  The summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_204339].   
 
10.4.  Primary Analysis   
The primary analysis will be a comparison of tissue stiffness measured by [CONTACT_204340] 2

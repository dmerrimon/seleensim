IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 8 of 61  23 November  2020  1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
• To reduce the incidence of relapse at [ADDRESS_708832] crisis  from a historical baseline of 45% to 25%, 
using ibrutinib maintenance therapy.  
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To study the incidence and severity of post -transplant complications in subject s 
receiving ibrutinib maintenance after allogeneic HCT.  
• To study the incidence of infectious complications in subject s receiving 
maintenance ibrutinib after allogeneic HCT.  
• To study the impact of ibrutinib maintenance on minimal residual disease after 
RIC and allogeneic HCT.  
• To study the impact of maintenance ibrutinib on immune reconstitution and 
alloreactivity after allogeneic HCT, specifically on Th1/Th2 polarization, T 
follicular cell number, T- and B -cell repertoire, serum immunoglobulin levels, and 
alloantibody formation. 
2. BACKGROUND  
2.[ADDRESS_708833] a higher risk of relapse compared to those receiving high- dose conditioning (1, 2) .  The incidence of post -transplant relapse in this setting is 
approximately 45% with current transplant approaches (1-6).  
2.[ADDRESS_708834] -in-class, potent, orally -administered, covalently -binding inhibitor of 
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK).  Inhibition of BTK blocks downstream B -cell receptor 
(BCR) signaling pathways and thus prevents B -cell proliferation.  In  vitro, ibrutinib 
inhibits purified BTK and selected members of the kinase family with 10- fold specificity 
compared with non- BTK kinases Ibrutinib (I mbruvica) is approved by [CONTACT_941] U  S Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of:  1) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in 
patients who have received at least one prior therapy based on overall response rate;   
2) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in patients who have received at least one prior 
therapy ;   3) CLL in patients with 17p deletion;  and 4)  Waldenström macroglobulinemia.  
Ibrutinib is currently under investigation in various indications .  It is not currently 
approved as a maintenance therapy for acute leukemia following allogeneic HCT, so this clinical trial requires an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.  
B-cells are lymphocytes with multiple functions in the immune response, including 
antigen presentation, antibody production, and cytokine release.  B -cells express cell

Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Leukemia  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 9 of 61  23 November  2020  surface immunoglobulins comprising the B -cell receptor (BCR), which is activated by 
[CONTACT_14178].  Antigen binding induces receptor aggregation and the clustering and 
activation of multiple tyrosine kinases, which in turn activate further downstream 
signaling pathways  (7).  
The process of B -cell maturation, including immunoglobulin chain rearrangement and 
somatic mutation, is tightly regulated.  It is thought that B -cell lymphomas and CLL 
result from mutations and translocations acquired during normal B- cell development (8) .  
Several lines of evidence suggest that signaling through the BCR is necessary to sustain the viability of B -cell malignancies.   
The role of BTK in BCR signal transduction is demonstrated by [CONTACT_543145] X- linked agammaglobulinemia and the mouse genetic 
disease X -linked immunodeficiency, both caused by a mutation in the BTK gene.  These 
genetic diseases are characterized by [CONTACT_147458] a failure to generate mature B -cells.  The BTK protein is expressed in most hematopoietic cells with the 
exception of T- cells and natural killer cells, but the selective effect of BTK mutations 
suggests that its primary functional role is in antigen receptor signaling in B -cells (9).  
Data from Study PCYC -[ADDRESS_708835] -dose at dose levels 
≥ 2.5 mg/kg.  In Study PCYC- [ZIP_CODE],  the BTK occupancies for the 2.5 mg/kg/day to 
12.5 mg/kg/day cohorts and for the 560 mg continuous dosing cohort, were all above 
90% at either [ADDRESS_708836] anti -tumor acti vity in AML .  The 
drug’s target, BTK, is constitutively activated in many forms of AML, and BTK inhibition with ibrutinib prevents AML blast proliferation in pre- clinical studies (10) .  Ibrutinib has 
also been shown to inhibit SDF1/CXCR4 interactions, thus interfering with the migration of leukemic cells and potentially rendering them more vulnerable to cytotoxic chemotherapy or graft --vs-leukemia effects by [CONTACT_543146] (11) .  Given the activity of ibrutinib against B -cells, t his compound is 
also under active investigation for its anti -tumor effects in acute B -lymphoblastic 
leukemias (12) . 
Recent studies show that B -cells are key mediators of chronic GvHD.  Dysfunctional 
B-cells have been identified in chronic GvHD, where patients have a relatively higher 
number of activated memory B -cells, higher levels of B -cell-activating factor of the tumor 
necrosis family (BAFF), and donor -derived alloantibodies (13) .  It has been 
demons trated that pathogenic antibody deposition occurs in human chronic GvHD, and 
a network of alloreactive T- helper cells, including Th1, Th2, Th17 and Tfh (T- follicular 
helper) cells infiltrate tissues and produce effector cytokines thereby [CONTACT_543147], similar to autoimmunity .  In addition, genetic studies 
confirmed that ITK and BTK are independently critical for chronic GvHD.  Ibrutinib, which hits both targets, showed effectiveness in both T- cell-driven and 
alloantibody -driven chronic GvHD models .  Ibrutinib treatment delayed progression, 
improved survival and ameliorated clinical and pathological manifestations in mouse models of sclerodermatous and alloantibody -driven chronic GvHD (14). 
A Phase [ADDRESS_708837] for AML and ALL.  The rationale for the use of ibrutinib in this setting is twofold:  ibrutinib may have direct anti -tumor effects against both AML and ALL, as described 
above; and ibrutinib may potentiate the immunologic graft --vs-leukemia effect driven by 
[CONTACT_48919] T- cells after allogeneic HCT.  In addition to the BTK -mediated effects of ibrutinib, 
the compound is known to inhibit ITK, a tyrosine kinase which plays a central role in T-cell differentiation (15) .  By [CONTACT_5219], ibrutinib may drive donor T- cells toward a 
Th1 phenotype, which is hypothesized to generate more effective graft --vs-leukemia 
reactions.  
2.[ADDRESS_708838] s in Appendi ces A & B.  Eligibility will 
be assessed initially before allogeneic HCT, and second confirmation of eligibility will be assessed prior to the administration of ibrutinib, between Day  +60 and 
Day +[ADDRESS_708839].  
3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
3.1.1 Inclusion Criteria for enrollment (pre- transplant)  
• D iagnos is of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute biphenotypic leukemia, or 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) .  CML transformed to blast crisis is  eligible.  
• Planned allogeneic HCT using FLU/MEL or FLU/BU conditioning (regimens 
defined below).  
• Planned GvHD prophylaxis consisting of TAC/MTX or TAC/SRL (regimens 
defined below).  
• HLA- identical sibling donor, HLA -matched unrelated donor, or donor mismat ched 
at 1 HLA allele or antigen.  
• Less than or equal to 5% blasts on bone marrow examination within 60 days  of 
starting conditioning.  
• Age ≥ 18 years  and ≤ 70 years . 
• Able to give informed consent.  
Subject s will be eligible if their planned conditioning regimen for  allogeneic HCT 
consists of one of the two following standard reduced- intensity conditioning regimens:  
• FLU/MEL :  Fludarabine 120 to 180 mg/m
2;  melphalan ≤ 150 mg/m2 
• FLU/BU:  Fludarabine 120 to 180 mg/m2;  busulfan ≤ 8 mg/kg orally or 
≤ 6.4 mg/kg int ravenously  
A Phase [ADDRESS_708840]-grafting immunosuppression consists of 
one of the two following regimens : 
• TAC/MTX:  Tacrolimus (oral or intravenous) and intravenous methotrexate 
administered according to institutional standard pr actice.  
• TAC/SRL :  Tacrolimus (oral or intravenous) and oral sirolimus, administered 
according to institutional standards of care.  
These two regimens of post -grafting immunosuppression have been shown to produce 
equivalent rates of GvHD , relapse- free survival, and GvHD- free survival in a 
prospective, randomized controlled trial  (16), and we thus view them as equivalent for 
the purposes of this clinical trial .  Immunosuppressant doses and taper schedules will 
be adjusted based on institutional standard practice and clinical factors, at the discretion of the attending physician, as in previous clinical trials of these regimens (16) .

A Phase 2 Study of Ibrutinib Maintenance After Reduced- Intensity Conditioning and Allogeneic 
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Leukemia  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 16 of 61  23 November  2020  Medications to be Used with Caution 
CYP3A Inhibitors/Inducers  
Ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A .  Avoid co -administration with strong 
CYP3A4 or moderate CYP3A inhibitors and consider alternative agents with less 
CYP3A inhibition.  
• If a strong CYP3A inhibitor ( eg, ketoconazole;  indinavir ;  nelfinavir ;  ritonavir ;  
saquinavir ;  clarithromycin ;  telithromycin ;  itraconazole;  nefazadone;  or 
cobicistat) must be used, reduce ibrutinib dose to 140 mg or withhold treatment 
for the duration of inhibitor use.  Subjects should be monitored for signs of 
ibrutinib toxicity.  
• If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor ( eg, voriconazole;  erythromycin;  amprenavir ;  
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] ;  atazanavir ;  ciprofloxacin;  crizotinib ;  darunavir/ritonavir ;  diltiazem ;  
fluconazole ;  fosamprenavir ;  imatinib ;  verapamil ;  amiodarone;  or dronedarone) 
must be used, reduce ibrutinib to 140 mg (for 840 mg/day dose, reduce to 
280 mg) for the duration of the inhibitor use.  Avoid grapefruit and Seville 
oranges during ibrutinib/placebo treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (see Appendix E  Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A ). 
• No dose adjustment is required in combination with mild inhibitors.  
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers ( eg, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, 
phenytoin, and St  John’s  Wort).  Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction.  
A list of common CYP3A inhibitors and inducers is provided in Appendix  E.  A 
comprehensive list  of inhibitors, inducers, and substrates may be found at 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main- table/ .  This website is continually revised 
and should be checked frequently for updates.   
Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Levels Altered by [CONTACT_543151] v
itro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of P -glycoprotein (P -gp), but is a 
mild inhibitor (with an IC 50 of 2.15  μg/mL).  Ibrutinib is not expected to have systemic 
drug- drug interactions with P -gp substrates.  However, it cannot be excluded that 
ibrutinib could inhibit intestinal P -gp after a therapeutic dose.  There is no clinical data 
available; therefore, to avoid a potential interaction in the GI tract, narrow therapeutic 
range P -gp substrates such as digoxin, should be taken at least 6 hours before or after 
ibrutinib . 
QT-prolonging Agents 
Any medications known to cause QT prolongation should be used with caution; periodic 
ECG and electrolyte monitoring should be considered.  
Antiplatelet Agents and Ant icoagulants 
Fatal bleeding events have occurred in subject s treated with ibrutinib .  Grade  3 or 
higher bleeding events (subdural hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria and 
post procedural hemorrhage) have occurred in up to 6% of subject s.  Bleeding events of 
A Phase [ADDRESS_708864] s receiving antiplatelet or 
anticoagulant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  See Section  6 (Dose Modification) for recommendations 
regarding ibrutinib dosing in subject s undergoing surgery or other invasive procedures.  
Warfarin or vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with 
ibrutinib .  Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided.  
Use ibrutinib with caution in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platelet function.  Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied.  Ibrutinib should be held at least [ADDRESS_708865] -surgery depending 
upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.  
Subjects requiring the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (other than warfarin or a vitamin K antagonist) during the course of the study should have treatment with ibrutinib held, and ibrutinib should not be restarted until the subject is clinically stable and has no signs of bleeding.  Subjects should be observed closely for signs and 
symptoms of bleeding .  No dose reduction is required when study drug is restarted.  
Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
Any chemotherapy, anticancer immunotherapy, experimental therapy, or radiotherapy is 
prohibited while the subject is receiving study treatment with ibrutinib .  Localized, 
hormonal, or bone- sparing treatment for non- hematologic  may be considered with 
approval of the PI.  
The Sponsor -investigator must be notified in advance (or as soon as possible 
thereafter) of any instances in which prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_23730].  
Permitted Concomitant Medications 
Supportive medications in accordance with standard practice (such as for emesis, 
diarrhea, etc ) are permitted.  Use of neutrophil growth factors (filgrastim and 
pegfilgrastim) or red blood cell growth factors (erythropoietin) is permitted per 
institutional policy and in accordance with relevant institutional and national guidelines.  Transfusions may be given in accordance with institutional policy.  
Antimicrobial prophylaxis 
All subject s should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis appropriate for allogeneic HCT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], according to institutional standard practice.  If no institutional standard 
practice exists, one recommended (although not required) approach is as follows:  
• Acyclovir [ADDRESS_708866] or until discontinuation of 
all systemic immunosuppressive medication, whichever occurs later.  
• Bactrim  SS [ADDRESS_708867] or until 
discontinuation of all systemic immunosuppression, whichever occurs later.  
• Fluconazole 400 mg daily from start of transplant conditioning until Day +[ADDRESS_708868] s’ clinical condition.  
4.[ADDRESS_708869] -transplant , or until one of the following 
occurs :  dise ase relapse; or discontinuation due to adverse events .  Subject s with 
leukemia relapse after allogeneic HCT will discontinue the study drug, and may be 
treated with any and all appropriate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including investigational agents, at the discretion of t he treating physician.  
Subject s will be withdrawn from study treatment if one of the following occurs :  leukemia 
relapse; unacceptable toxicity requiring interruption of ibrutinib for more than 28 continuous  days ; investigator decision; withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_543152]/or follow -up; pregnancy; or study termination.  All enrolled subject s, 
regardless of discontinuation of study treatment, will be followed for leukemia relapse and survival until [ADDRESS_708870]  withdraws consent 
for follow -up. 
Withdrawal from the study will occur under the following conditions :  withdrawal of 
consent for follow -up observation by [CONTACT_423] ; loss to follow- up; study termination; or 
death.  When an enrolled subject  withdraws from the study, the reason for withdrawal 
should be documented, as should the subject ’s willingness to participate in follow -up 
visits or assessments.

5. INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT  INFORMATION  
5.1  Investigational Agent   
The investigational agent utilized in this clinical trial is ibrutinib, administered at a dose 
of 420 mg orally once -a-day (with dose adjustments for concomitant medications or 
toxicity as described elsewhere in this protocol) and continued for 1 year, until disease 
progr ession, or until discontinuation due to adverse events.   EXCEPTION:  The starting 
dose for subjects with mild liver impairment (Child- Pugh Class  A) is defined to be 
140 mg/day.  
Ibrutinib capsules are size 0, hard gelatin capsules for oral administration and contain 
140 mg of micronized ibrutinib (content may be adjusted for water content and purity) 
and the following compendial excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (National Formulary, Pharmacopoeia Europe, Japan Pharmacopoeia) :  microcrystalline cellulose; croscarmellose sodium; sodium 
lauryl sulfate; and magnesium stearate.  Capsules are packaged in high- density 
polyethylene bottles with an induction seal and a child resistant screw -top cap.  The 
number of capsules per bottle is indicated on the label.  
A Phase 2 Study of Ibrutinib Maintenance After Reduced- Intensity Conditioning and Allogeneic 
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Leukemia  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 19 of 61  23 November  2020  Ibrutinib capsules should be stored according to the storage conditions indicated on the 
label .  The recommended storage condition for ibrutinib capsules is 15° C to 25° C (59° 
F to 77° F) with excursions permitted to 30° C (86° F) .  Ibrutinib should be administered 
orally once daily with a glass of water at approximately the same time each day .  The 
capsules should be swallowed whole with water and should not be opened, broken, or chewed.  Ibrutinib must not be taken with grapefruit juice.  
There are limited data on the effects of ibrutinib overdose.  No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached in the Phase 1 study in which subjects received up to 
12.5 mg/kg/day (1400 mg).  In a separate study, one healthy subject who received a 
dose of 1680 mg experienced reversible Grade 4 hepatic enzyme increases (AST and 
ALT) .  There is no specific antidote for ibrutinib.  Subjects who ingested more than the 
recommended dosage should be closely monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment.  
For the most comprehensive information regarding ibrutinib, refer to the current version of the Investigator's Brochure.  
Pharmacology  
Ibrutinib was designed as a selective and covalent inhibitor of Brut on’s tyrosine kinase 
(17).  In vitro, ibrutinib is a potent inhibitor of Btk activity (IC50 = 0.39 nM).  The 
irreversible binding of ibrutinib to cysteine- 481 in the active site of Btk results in 
sustained inhibition of Btk catalytic activity and enhanced selectivity over other kinases that do not contain a cysteine at this position.  When added directly to human whole blood, ibrutinib inhibits signal transduction from the B -cell receptor and blocks primary 
B-cell activation (IC50 = 80 nM) as assayed by [CONTACT_14181] -IgM stimulation followed by [CONTACT_398]69 
expression (18) . 
Ibrutinib arrested cell growth and induced apoptosis in human B -cell lymphoma cell 
lines in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo in xenograft models (18).  Ibrutinib also 
inhibited adhesion and migration of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells in co- culture and 
reduced tumor burden in lymph node and bone marrow in a murine model of MCL dissemination and progression (19) . 
Toxicology 
In safety pharmacology assessments, no treatment -related effects were observed in the 
central nervous system or respi[INVESTIGATOR_14128].  Further, no 
treatment -related corrected QT interval (QT
c) prolongation effect was observed at any 
tested dose in a cardiovascular study using telemetry -monitored do gs.  
Based on data from rat and dog including general toxicity studies up to [ADDRESS_708872] potential for human toxicity with ibrutinib is predicted to be in lymphoid tissues (lymphoid depletion) and the gastrointestinal tract (soft feces/diarrhea with or without inflammation).  Additional toxicity findings seen in only one species with no observed human correlate in clinical studies to date include pancreatic acinar cell

Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Leukemia  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 20 of 61  23 November  2020  atrophy (rat), minimally decreased trabecular and cortical bone (rat) and corneal 
dystrophy (dog).   
In vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies showed that ibrutinib is not genotoxic.  In a rat 
embryo- fetal toxicity study ibrutinib administration was associated with fetal loss and 
malformations (teratogenicity) at ibrutinib doses that result in approximately 6 times and 14 times the exposure (AUC) in subject s administered the dose of [ADDRESS_708873] not been conducted with ibrutinib.  Ibrutinib was not 
mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in a chromosome aberration assay in mammalian (CHO) cells, nor was it clastogenic in an in vivo b one marrow micronucleus assay in mice at doses up to 2000 mg/kg.  Fertility 
studies with ibrutinib have not been conducted in animals .  In the general toxicology 
studies conducted in rats and dogs, orally administered ibrutinib did not result in adverse effects on reproductive organs.  
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism  
Following oral administration of ibrutinib at doses ranging from 1.25 to 12.5 mg/kg/day 
as well as fixed dose levels of 420, 560, and 840 mg/day, exposure to ibrutinib 
increased as doses increased with substantial intersubject variability.  The mean half-life (t
1/2) of ibrutinib across 3 clinical studies ranged from 4 to 9 hours, with a median 
time to maximum plasma concentration (T max) of [ADDRESS_708874] dose exposure.  
The results of human mass balance study of [14C] -ibrutinib conducted in six healthy 
male subjects demonstrated that less than 10% of the total dose of [14C] -ibrutinib is 
renally excreted, whereas approximately 80% is recovered in feces.  Subjects with mild and moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance > 30 mL/min) were eligible to 
enroll in Study PCYC- 1102- CA in which pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments were 
included.  No dose adjustment is needed for mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance).  There is no data in subject s with severe renal 
impairment or subject s on dialysis.  The study of ibrutinib in hepatic impaired subjects is 
currently in progress.

Risks  
Bleeding- related events 
There have been reports of hemorrhagic events in subjects treated with ibrutinib both 
with and without thrombocytopenia.  These include primarily minor hemorrhagic events such as contusion;  epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] ;  and petechiae; and some major hemorrhagic events 
including gastrointestinal bleeding;  intracranial hemorrhage;  and hematuria. Use of 
ibrutinib in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platelet function may increase the risk of bleeding.  
Leukostasis 
There were isolated cases of leukostasis reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  A 
high number of circulating lymphocytes ( > 400,000/µL) may confer increased risk .  
Consider temporarily holding ibr utinib.  Subjects should be closely monitored.  
Administer supportive care including hydration and/or cytoreduction as indicated.   
Lymphocytosis 
Upon initiation of treatment, a reversible increase in lymphocyte counts (ie, ≥  50% 
increase from baseline and an absolute count > 5000/µL), often associated with 
reduction of lymphadenopathy, has been observed in most subjects with chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) treated with ibrutinib.  
This effect has also been observed in some subjects with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
A Phase [ADDRESS_708876] few  week s of 
ibrutinib therapy (median time 1.1 week s) and typi[INVESTIGATOR_36065] a median of 
8.0 week s in subjects with MCL and 18.7 week s in subjects with CLL/SLL.  
A large increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes ( eg, > 400,000/µL) has been 
observed in some subjects .  Lymphocytosis was not commonly observed in subjects 
with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia treated with ibrutinib.  Lymphocytosis appeared to occur in lower incidence and at lesser magnitude in subjects with CLL/SLL receiving ibrutinib in combination with chemoimmunotherapy.  
Atrial Fibrillation  
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib, 
particularly in subjects with cardiac risk factors,  hypertension,  acute infections, and a 
previous history of atrial fibrillation.  For atrial fibrillation which persists, consider the risks and benefits of ibrutinib treatment and follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section  6).
 
Cytopenias 
Treatment- emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and 
anemia) were reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.   
Diarrhea Diarrhea is the most frequently reported non- hematologic AE with ibrutinib monotherapy 
and combination therapy .  Othe r frequently reported gastrointestinal events include 
nausea, vomiting, and constipation.  These events are rarely severe.  Should symptoms 
be severe or prolonged follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section  6).  
Infections  
Fatal and non-f atal infections have occurred with ibrutinib therapy .  At least 25% of 
subjects with MCL and 35% of subjects with CLL had Grade 3 or greater infections per 
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) .  The most 
commonly reported infections include pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infection and 
sepsis .  Although causality has not been established, cases of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in subject s treated with ibrutinib.   Cases of 
hepatitis E, which may be chronic, have occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib. 
Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms (such as fever, chills, weakness,  
confusion, vomiting and jaundice, and abnormal liver function tests) and appropriate therapy  should be instituted as indicated.  
Lymphocytosis 
Upon initiation of treatment, a reversible increase in lymphocyte counts ( ie, ≥ 50% 
increase from baseline and an absolute count > 5, 000/µL), often associated with 
reduction of lymphadenopathy, has been observed in most subjects with CLL/SLL 
A Phase [ADDRESS_708877] few weeks of ibrutinib therapy (median time 1.1 week s) and typi[INVESTIGATOR_36065] a median of 
8.0 week s in subjects with MCL and 18.7 week s in subjects with CLL/SLL.  
A large increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes ( eg, > 400,000/µL) has been 
observed in some subjects .  Lymphocytosis was not observed in subjects with WM 
treated with ibrutinib.  Lymphocytosis appeared to occur in lower incidence and at lesser magnitude in subjects with CLL/SLL receiving ibrutinib in combination with chemoimmunotherapy.  
Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer  
Non-melanoma skin cancers have occurred in subject s treated with ibrutinib.  Monitor 
subject s for the appearance of non- melanoma skin cancer.  
Rash  
Rash has been commonly reported in subjects treated with either single- agent ibrutinib 
or in combination with chemotherapy .  Rash occurred at a higher rate in the ibrutinib 
arm than in the ofatumumab arm in Study 1112.  Most rashes were mild to moderate in severity. 
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)  
There have been reports of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) events in subjects treated with 
single- agent ibrutinib or in combination with chemotherapy .  Subjects at risk of tumor 
lysis syndrome are those with comorbidities and/or risk factors such as high tumor burden prior to treatment, increased uric acid (hyperuricemia), elevated lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), bulky disease at baseline, and pre‐ existing kidney abnormalities  
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) 
Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been reported in subject s treated with 
ibrutinib .  Monitor subject s for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD .  Should 
symptoms develop, follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section  6). 
5.[ADDRESS_708878] s.  
No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached in the Phase 1 study , in which 
subjects received up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (1, 400 mg/day) .  Healthy subjects were 
exposed up to single dose of 1, [ADDRESS_708879] experienced reversible 
Grade 4 hepatic enzyme increases (AST and ALT) after a dose of 1, [ADDRESS_708880] more than the recommended dosage should be closely monitored and given 
appropriate supportive treatment.  
Refer to Section  7.2 for further information regarding AE reporting.   
6. DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
The study dose levels of ibrutinib are defined as follows.  
Dose level 0:  420 mg orally once a day.  
Dose level - 1:  280 mg orally once a day.  
Dose leve l -2:  140 mg orally once a day.  
Dose level - 3:  Disconti nue ibrutinib.  
The dose of ibrutinib should be modified according to the dose modification guidelines 
in Table 2 if any of the following toxicities occur  and are considered to be due to 
ibrutinib . 
Hematologic Adverse Events  
• Grade 3 ANC ( < 1,000/ µL) with an associated temperature ≥  38.5°C  
• Grade 4 ANC ( < 500/µL) for more than 7 days  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia ( < 50,000/µL) in the presence of Grade ≥ 2 bleeding 
events  
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia ( < 25,000/µL)  
Non-Hematologic Adverse Events  
• Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea if persistent, despi[INVESTIGATOR_9025] -emetic 
and/or anti -diarrheal therapy  
• Any other Grade 4 or unmanageable Grade  3 toxicity attributed to ibrutinib

may be re- escalated after 8  week s of a dose reduction in the absence of a recurrence of 
the toxicity that led to the reduction.  
Dose modifications for use with CYP3A inhibitors  
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors which would be taken chronically 
(eg, ritonavir ;  indinavir nelfinavir ;  saquinavir ;  boceprevir ;  telaprevir ;  nefazodone) is 
not recommended.  For short -term use (treatment for 7  days  or less) of strong CYP3A 
inhibitors ( eg, antifungals and antibiotics) either reduce ibrutinib dose to [ADDRESS_708885] 
be used ( eg, fluconazole;  darunavir ;  erythromycin;  diltiazem ;  atazanavir ;  aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] ;  
amprenav ir;  fosamprevir ;  crizotinib ;  imatinib ;  verapamil ;  and ciprofloxacin) .  Subject s 
taking concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be monitored more closely for signs of ibrutinib toxicity.  
As most study subject s are expected to be receiving azoles (fluconazole;  
voriconazole;  posaconazole) until at least Day  +[ADDRESS_708886], the dose 
of ibrutinib will be 140 orally once daily while on such medications.  Once these 
agents are stopped, the dose may be escalated to 420 mg once daily.

Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Leukemia  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 26 of 61  23 November  2020  Dose modifications for hepatic impairment  
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver and therefore subjects with clinically significant 
hepatic impairment at the time of screening ( Child -Pugh  Class B or C)  are excluded 
from study participation.  For subjects who develop mild liver impairment while on study (Child -Pugh C lass A), the recommended dose reduction for ibrutinib is to 140 mg daily 
(1 capsule) .  Subjects who develop moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
(Child -Pugh C lass B or C) will have study drug withheld until resolved to mild  
impairment ( Child -Pugh  Class A) or better .  Subjects who completely resolve liver 
impairment may re-initiate ibrutinib treatment according to Table 2.  Subjects who 
resolve liver impairment to mild (Child -Pugh  Class A) may re -start ibrutinib treatment at 
140 mg daily ( 1 capsule) .  Continue to m onitor subjects for signs of toxicity and follow 
dose modification guidance as needed (Refer to Table 2 ). 
Dose modifications for planned surgery or invasive procedures 
The following recommendations should be considered during the perioperative period 
for subjects who require surgical intervention or an invasive procedure while receiving ibrutinib:  
a. For any planned major surgery or invasive procedure requiring sutures or staples 
for closure,  ibrutinib should be held at least [ADDRESS_708887] 7 days  after the procedure, and restarted at the discretion 
of the investigator when the surgical site is reasonably healed without serosanguineous drainage or the need for drainage tubes.  
b. For planned minor procedures (such as a central line placement, needle biopsy, 
thoracentesis, or paracentesis) ibrutinib should be held for at least [ADDRESS_708888] ’s clinical situation, and the 
urgency of the procedure.  
6.[ADDRESS_708889] if any of the following occur . 
• Grade 4 treatment related (ie, possibly -, probably -, or de finitely -related) 
non-hematologic toxicity  
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >  21 days  
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting > 21 days or associated with clinically 
significant bleeding (requiring >  [ADDRESS_708890] loss OR bleeding from a site which in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_197727] a

7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES 
7.1 Potential Adverse Events 
Please see “Risks” in Section  5.1 above for a full description of known risks and 
toxicities associated with ibrutinib.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4.03 .  Both Serious and 
Non-Serious Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation and listed on 
study  specific Case Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will 
assess each Adverse Event (AE) to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed Consent, Protocol Document, or Investigator’s Brochure, and related to the investigation.  All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution, or until [ADDRESS_708891] dose of the study treatment.  
An adverse event (AE) will be defined as any medical change in the subject’s baseline or pre- treatment condition (occurring during the course of the clinical study) after 
receiving the study drug (ibrutinib), whether considered treatment -related or not .  
Adverse events will be monitored spontaneously by [CONTACT_543153] a result of general questioning by [CONTACT_543154].  All adverse events will be recorded.  As far as possible, each adverse event will be 
described by [CONTACT_13662] (start and end dates), frequency (single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], intermittent, continuous), severity (mild, moderate, severe) and assessment of its cause (the underlying study indication, co- existing disease, concomitant medication, investigational 
drug,  or other), relationship to investigational drug (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, 
probably, definitely) , whether it influenced the course of treatment, whether it required 
specific therapy and what is expected or unexpected.  All adverse events will be graded on a three point scale of increasing severity .  Serious adverse events will be reported to 
the IRB and appropriate regulatory agencies.  
An adverse event is any significant medical occurrence in a subject  treated on this 
protocol both during treatment and follow -up period, regardless of causality 
assessment .  This includes adverse clinical or laboratory findings, inter -current illness , 
or an exacerbation or progression of a condition present at the time of study initiation.  An adverse event is considered serious if it fulfills one of the following criteria:  
a. Results in death 
b. Life-threatening ( subject  at risk of d eath at the time of the event)  
c. Requires in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability  
e. Other medical events that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_543123]  
A Phase [ADDRESS_708892] s will be evaluated for adverse events at every clinic visit .  All adverse events will 
be documented by [CONTACT_543155], if known : 
a. Medical diagnosis of the event  
b. Date and time of onset of event  
c. Date and time of resolution of event  
d. Severity of the event according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Toxicity Criteria and Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria, version 4.0 
e. Frequency of the event  
f. Intervention 
g. Outcome  
h. Likelihood of association between the event and the study drug 
The following are NOT considered AEs:  
• Pre-existing condition:  A pre -existing condition (documented on the medical 
history CRF) is not considered an AE unless the severity, frequency, or character of the event worsens during the study period.  
• Pre-planned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_543124], but rather a therapeutic intervention.  However, if during the pre- planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_543125], which prolongs the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14149], the event will be considered an SAE .  Surgeries or interventions that were under 
consideration, but not performed before enrollment in the study, will not be considered serious if they are performed after enrollment in the study for a 
condition that has not changed from its baseline level .  Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_543126], solely for the administration of chemotherapy, or due to long 
travel distances are also not SAEs.  
• Diagnostic Testing and Procedures:  Testing and procedures should not to be 
reported as AEs or SAEs, but rather the cause for the test or procedure should 
be reported.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_708893] Cancer Center Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) using the study specific CRF regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation.  Following review by [CONTACT_6802], events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be reported to the IRB using eProtocol within [ADDRESS_708894] provide follow -up information as soon as it is known.  
Adverse events that are serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, and are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug ibrutinib (S[LOCATION_003]R per 
21CFR§312.32) , will be reported to the FDA via IND Safety Report [21CFR§312.32] 
A Phase 2 Study of Ibrutinib Maintenance After Reduced- Intensity Conditioning and Allogeneic 
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Leukemia  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 29 of 61  23 November  2020  within 14  calendar  days , or within 7  calendar  days if the event is an unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening suspected adverse reaction.  
In addition, all serious adverse events (initial and follow -up information) will be reported 
on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form from Pharmacyclics and sent via em ail or 
fax to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety or designee within [ADDRESS_708895] follow -up and other additional 
information from the Investigator (for instance, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]/discharge notes and laboratory results) .  The contact [CONTACT_3031] (phone, email and fax) for Pharmacyclics 
Drug Safety can be found on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form and instructions.  
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an aggressive therapy for the treatment of a number of life- threatening malignant and non- malignant disorders .  Individuals 
considered for HCT have generally exhausted other avenues of effective therapy .  The 
non-relapse mortality (NRM) associated with a sibling- donor myeloablative allogeneic  
transplant is approximately 20% and the NRM for an unrelated- donor myeloablative 
allogeneic transplant ranges from 20- 50%.  In the setting of reduced- intensity 
conditioning and allogeneic HCT, the NRM is approximately 10% with a sibling donor and 20% with an unrelated donor . 
As an aggressive therapy , HCT is associated with a large number of AEs and SAEs.  
The toxicities associated with HCT are related to the following:  1)  the underlying 
disease;  2) therapy antecedent to HCT;  3) the health status of the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] , 
including co- existing conditions ;  4) the preparative regimen employed before 
transplant ;  5) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_543127] -related complications 
(eg, immunosuppressants for the prevention of GvHD);  and 6)  the treatment of 
complications of HCT.  
The use of toxicity grading scales such as the NCI CTC is a standard in the medical 
community for the reporting of AEs and SAEs in the investigation of new drugs or 
devices.  The use of this type of scale is less helpful in the evaluation of AEs and SAEs associated with a treatment, such as HCT.  In an effort to report to regulatory agencies the toxicities that are relevant and meaningful for the evaluation of risks and benefits to potential HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , the following guidelines will serve to determine which events 
are reported as AEs and SAEs.  
The following SAEs require reporting to the Stanford Cancer Institute Data Safety Monitoring Board for subjects on research protocols.  If the event is unexpected, serious , and harmful , then it will also  require reporting to the IRB:  
1) Deaths  
All deaths:  
• while the subject  is receiving treatment on a protocol  
• up to 60 days  (autologous) or 90 days  (allogeneic) after last dose of protocol 
treatment  
• or any death that occurs more than 60 days  (autologous) or 90 days  (allogeneic) 
after protocol treatment has ended that is felt to be treatment related.  
A Phase [ADDRESS_708896] be noted that obtaining detailed information on the cause and circumstances of a death occurring at another  institution can be difficult .  Excludes deaths related to 
relapse of underlying disease, which will reported to the IRB at the time of protocol 
renewal.  
2) All serious and unexpected toxicities  
Defined as those toxicities not identified in the transplant literature, product inserts , or 
study  consent form.  
The following will be recorded, but generally will  not be reported as AEs or SAEs , 
unless also considered related to the study  drug.   
1) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_543128] 50% of allogeneic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_543129].  The most common indications for readmission of an allogeneic HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_119761], failure to maintain nutritional status , and GvHD.   NOTE:  Events 
that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_543130].  
2) Relapse of disease Relapse unfortunately remains a significant problem following both autologous and 
allogeneic HCT.  The risk of relapse is influenced by [CONTACT_543156] .  The risk of relapse following allogeneic transplant is extremely dependent 
on the disease being treated but ranges from 10% (for subject s with severe aplas tic 
anemia) to 80% (for subject s with refractory acute leukemia).  
3) Common and expected toxicities of HCT ≤  Grade  [ADDRESS_708897] disease, hematuria , hypertension, hypotension, hypoxia, incontinence, infections, insomnia, laboratory abnormalities, mental stat us changes, mood alterations, mucositis, nausea , 
neutropenia, pain, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, rash, seizures, sepsis, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy, tremor, vomiting.  For IND studies, SAEs  that are S[LOCATION_003]Rs per 21CFR§312.32 will 
be reported as IND  Safety  Reports (see above).  
4) Acute and chronic GvHD 
Acute and chronic GvHD are major complications of HCT and account  for most 
non-relapse mortality .  The incidence of GvHD  will be reported as part of the 
secondary outcomes and to the IRB at the time of the protocol annual review.  
A Phase 2 Study of Ibrutinib Maintenance After Reduced- Intensity Conditioning and Allogeneic 
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Leukemia  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 31 of 61  23 November  2020  5) Secondary Malignancies  
The occurrence of secondary malignancies and associated mortality is a known risk 
of cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The occurrence of secondary malignancies will be reported to the IRB at the time of the protocol annual review.  
6) Special reporting situations  which may require expedited reporting and/or 
safety evaluation include, but are not limited to: 
• Overdose of any study drug 
• Suspected abuse/misuse of a study drug 
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a study drug 
• Medication error involving a product (with or without subject exposure to the 
study drug)  
Occurrence of any special reporting situation  should be recorded in the CRF.  If any 
special reporting situation meets the criteria for an adverse event, it should be 
recorded on the adverse events CRF.  If the adverse event is considered serious, it 
should be recorded on the adverse events CRF as serious and should be reported 
on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form .  The SAE Report Form should be sent 
via email or fax to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety or designee within [ADDRESS_708898] (AESI)  
Specific adverse events, or groups of adverse events, will be followed as part of 
standard safety monitoring activities .  The following  events (regardless of seriousness) 
will be reported to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety per SAE reporting timelines.  
Major Hemorrhage  
Major hemorrhage is defined as any of the following:  
• Any treatment -emer gent hemorrhagic adverse events of Grade 3 or higher* .  Any 
treatment -emergent serious adverse events of bleeding of any grade 
• Any treatment -emergent central nervous system hemorrhage/hematoma of any 
grade  
*All hemorrhagic events requiring transfusion of red blood cells should be reported 
as Grade [ADDRESS_708899]. 
Expediting Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
All serious adverse events and AESIs (initial and follow -up information) will be 
reported on FDA Medwatch (Form  3500A) or Suspect Adverse Event Report 
(CIOMS  Form  1) IRB Reporting Form and sent via email ( @pcyc.com ) 
or fax ( [PHONE_4272]) to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, within [ADDRESS_708900]'s participation in the study, must be followed until any of the following occurs:  
• The event resolves  
• The event stabilizes  
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is avai lable  
• The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors 
unrelated to study  conduct  
• It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or 
health care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow up after demonstration of due diligence with follow -up efforts)  
8. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
We propose a series of correlative laboratory studies using blood samples collected 
from stud y participants, with the aim of elucidating the impact of ibrutinib on immune 
reconstitution after allogeneic HCT and on the development of alloreactivity, graft-- vs-tumor effects, and GvHD . 
Background 
Alloreactive T - and B -cells play a crucial role in development of both beneficial 
graft-vs-tumor effects and harmful GvHD after allogeneic HCT.  In chronic GvHD, 
T follicular helper cells (TFH), Th2, and Th17 T- cells activate B -cells and elicit fibrotic 
cascades underpi[INVESTIGATOR_543131].  To 
understand the impact of ibrutinib on alloreactivity after allogeneic HCT, we will perform 
global B - and T- cell immune phenotype analysis using multiplexed CyTOF analysis, 
focused on quantifying Th2 subversion and cytotoxic T- cell preservation, T follicular cell 
composition, and T-ce ll functional activation.  These laboratory assays will be correlated 
with clinical evidence of GvHD and GVL effects (quantified by [CONTACT_543157] T- and B -cell immune receptors with clonoSEQ 
technology (in subject s with ALL) and via multi -parameter flow cytometry (in subject s 
with AML).  
T- and B -cell repertoire reconstitution will be monitored via immune receptor 
high- throughput sequencing (HTS) and H -Y alloreactive B -cell phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  We will 
determine the effect of  ibrutinib on serum immunoglobulin levels, cytokine quantification, 
protective anti -EBV and anti -tetanus immunity, and allogeneic H -Y antibody responses 
after allogeneic HCT.  
Minor histocompatibility antigens expressed on the Y chromosome are called H -Y 
antigens and are frequently targeted by [CONTACT_543158] s 
undergo sex -mismatched transplantation (F M HCT).  [CONTACT_543171]’ lab has demonstrated 
that H -Y specific B- cells and antibodies are associated with chronic GvHD following 
FM HCT .  We hypothesize that ibrutinib will preferentially target and deplete 
A Phase [ADDRESS_708901] s with female 
donors (F M HCT) .  Recogniz ing this limitation for H -Y antigen studies, as well as 
limitations in the number of PBMC available for research per subject , we have decided 
to dedicate F M HCT subject  samples to H -Y B-cell analyses while using samples from 
all other donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_543132] (not F M) for T -helper cell and 
functional T- cell analyses as shown in Table  3 below .  Historically, F M allotransplants 
account for 35- 40% of cases of chronic GvHD. 
Sample collection  
As in the PCYC 1129 protocol, 50 mL of blood will be collected in five 10 mL 
heparinized green- top tubes before the start of conditioning therapy; before ibrutinib 
intiation; and then again at Day +180, [ADDRESS_708902] University, providing three vials of 1.5 mL 
plasma and five 1 mL vials of viably frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
separated by [CONTACT_543159]1129 laboratory 
manual .  PBMC cell yields will be recorded and evenly distributed into five vials 
irrespective of cell quantity .  Plasma will be stored at -80° C and PBMC will be stored in 
liquid nitrogen on- site.  Comprehensive multiplexed B - and T-cell phenotype analysis 
will be performed on all samples at all time points using CyTOF.  In addition, B - and 
T-cell repertoire analyses will be determined using immune receptor high- throughput 
sequencing (HTS) .  We plan to reserve a single vial of PBMC and [ADDRESS_708903] Pre-

A Phase [ADDRESS_708904] s, ibrutinib rapi[INVESTIGATOR_543133]- germinal -center B -cells (CD19+CD38+CD27+IgD+), which have previously 
been associated with development of c hronic GvHD.  In contrast, memory B -cells 
(CD19+CD27+IgD-CD38-) persisted, and total serum IgG levels were maintained despi[INVESTIGATOR_543134] .  Subset analysis of T- cells showed a 75% reduction in 
GATA3 -expressing Th2 cells, while Tbet -expressing Th1 cells remained unaffected.  
Tfollicular cells (CD4+CXCR5+BCL6+) were likewise depleted rapi[INVESTIGATOR_543135] (Figure 1).  Taken together, these preliminary results 
support the hypothesis that ibrutinib treatment after allogeneic HCT will result in Th1 polarization of the T- cell repertoire, preservation of CD8+ T- cells, and depletion of T 
follicular cells, all of which would be expected to reduce GvHD risk while maintaining 
beneficial anti -tumor alloreactivity .  Of note, these preliminary data were obtained in 
subject s treated with ibrutinib for relapse, while the proposed study herein attempts to 
elucidate the role of maintenance ibrutinib on immune reconstitution and GvHD.

Secondary endpoints include the incidence of acute GvHD  Grades  II–IV and III –IV at 
Day +[ADDRESS_708908] s. 
10.1.2 Measurement  Definition  
For the primary outcome measure, relapsed leukemia is defined as > 5% leukemic 
blasts detected in bone marrow or peripheral blood.  Subject s will also be considered to 
have relapsed leukemia if they receive any active treatment for progressive leukemia 
after allogeneic HCT, even if they have <5% leukemic blasts .  Withdrawal of 
immunosuppression alone is not considered an active treatment for progressive disease.  
For the secondary outcome measures, acute GvHD will be graded and scored 
according to standard criteria (Appendix  C).  Chronic GvHD will be graded and scored 
according to the 2014 NIH consensus criteria (Appendix D) .  Minimal residual disease 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_5019]- throughput sequencing (ClonoSEQ) for subject s with ALL, and 
by [CONTACT_5019]- sensitivity flow cytomet ry for subject s with AML or acute biphenotypic leukemia.  
Minimal residual disease will be considered present if > 1 x 10
-6 leukemic clones are 
detected by [CONTACT_543162]  (20), or if any aberrant blasts matching the original leukemic 
immunophenotype are detected by [CONTACT_5019]- sensitivity flow cytometry (21). 
10.1.3 Measurement Methods and Time Points 
The primary outcome will be measured by [CONTACT_543163]  +90;  
Day +180;  and [ADDRESS_708909] s with AML or myeloid leukemias, 
and by [CONTACT_217022] -blood high- throughput sequencing on Day  +90;  Day +180;  1 year;  
18 months;  and [ADDRESS_708910] s with ALL .  Minimal residual disease 
detection by [CONTACT_5019]- throughput sequencing is not itself diagnostic of relapse, but should 
prompt a bone marrow examination to assess definitively for relapse.  Routine monitoring of peripheral blood counts and differential will also be performed according to clinica l standards of care, with bone marrow examination performed in response to 
any concerning findings to assess for relapse.  
The secondary outcomes will be measured as follows :  acute GvHD  will be scored 
weekly  (if returning to the transplant center that frequently)  from initiation of ibrutinib 
through Day +100 using the criteria described above.  Chronic GvHD will be assessed 
at Day +180, at [ADDRESS_708911], using the criteria described above. Minimal residual disease will be assessed as 
described above on Day  +90;  Day  +180;  1 year;  and [ADDRESS_708912].  
For the Day  +100 and Day  +180 timepoints, the relevant evaluations may be performed 
within +/ - 2 week s of the specified timepoint .  For  the 9 -month; 1-year; 15-month;  and 
18-month timepoints, the relevant evaluations should be performed within +/ - 4 week s of 
the specified timepoint.  
11. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to the study ( eg, advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_543164] (SRC).  Any changes made to the protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by [CONTACT_14226].  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information to all participating investigators.  
11.[ADDRESS_708913] and site investigators and their research staff.  The Protocol Director will review data to assure the validity of data, as well as the safety of the subjects.  The Protocol Director will also monitor the progress of the trial.  The Protocol Director will be responsible for maintaining the clinical protocol, reporting adverse event, assuring the consent is obtained and documented, reporting of unexpected outcomes and reporting 
the status of the trial in the continuing renewal report submitted annually to the IRB and SRC.  
A safety monitoring committee (SMC) will be composed of the Protocol Director and 
research staff, including other site principal investigators.  The SMC will conduct regular 
teleconferences on at least a quarterly basis or more frequent communication between the Protocol Director and research staff may occur via email or teleconference as necessary.  
The data will be monitored continuously over the accrual and follow up periods by [CONTACT_543165].  The Protocol Director will be responsible for maintaining the clinical protocol, reporting adverse event, assuring the consent is obtained and documented, reporting of unexpected outcomes and reporting the status of the trial to the IRB and the Stanford University Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
11.3 Data Management Plan 
The Protocol Director, or his/her designee, will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate participant case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study.  Study -specific electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs) will document treatment 
outcomes for data analysis.  T he RedCAP database system will be used and  
maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or his designees .  The eCRFs will be  secured via confidential 
username [CONTACT_543170] . 
A Phase [ADDRESS_708914].  Therefore, study 
subjects will be assigned a unique study identification (ID) number .  Referring 
physicians will be sent letters by [CONTACT_543166]'s 
status , including information regarding the expected side effects of the treatment, 
necessary precautions and also the appropriate follow -up.  Specific information 
regarding the study would not be routinely shared with the referring physician.  
Subject s will be assigned a study -specific identification number (a unique number) and 
their data are entered into a secure database .  Access to the database is 
password- restricted a nd limited to study personnel.  
Research records will be maintained in a secure BMT office, and electronic data will be 
maintained in a study -specific, secure database.  In addition, information from the main 
Stanford BMT database may be uploaded into the study -specific database.  
All study staff will be required to complete HIPAA training.  All research staff must complete the IRB human subjects research training.  The study subject data are identified by a unique study ID number in the research documents .  Access to the 
research database is limited to approved clinical and research staff .  The code is 
maintained by [CONTACT_543167]’s BMT Database System Administrator, and kept in a secure location.  
Study subjects will not be directly identified in any publications, presentations or correspondence.

12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.[ADDRESS_708915] Size, and Sample Size 
This study is designed as a single-a rm efficacy trial using historical published controls .  
This study’s primary endpoint is the incidence of relapse at [ADDRESS_708916] for AML/ALL.  Baseline relapse rates after reduced- intensity conditioning for these 
diseases in the published literature vary from 40– 60% (1-6).  For the purposes of study 
design, we will use a relatively conservative baseline relapse risk of 45% .  This study is 
designed to detect a decrease in relapse rate from 45% to 25% .  Therefore, in the 
power analysis we will assume that the true relapse rate in the study population is 25%, while the null hypothesis holds that the relapse rate is 45% .  Under these conditions, 
using intent -to-treat analysis, a sample size of [ADDRESS_708917] s will provide 84% 
power to conclude that the relapse rate is lower than 45% at the two- sided significance 
level of 0.05.  Conservatively assuming that [ADDRESS_708918] s meet the secondary 
criteria  to continue to ibrutinib treatment  (Appendix  B) and are treated with ibrutinib, a 
subgroup analysis restricted to these [ADDRESS_708919] 78% power to conclude that 
the relapse rate is <  45% with a significance level of 0.05.

Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Leukemia  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 41 of 61  23 November  2020  12.2 Interim analyses  
We will monitor major adverse event rates as described above, in particular serious 
bleeding complications (hemorrhage Grade 3 or 4, as defined by [CONTACT_400605] v4.0) .  We will 
monitor and estimate the incidence rate of serious bleeding in study participants, and 
report all occurrences and corresponding analytic summaries (such as the estimated incidence rate with 95% confidence intervals) to the DSMB to assist in decision- making 
regarding early termination for safety.  
Allogeneic HCT is an intensive therapy with many associated side effects and toxicities related to the transplant conditioning regimen;  the ensuing immunosuppressed status ;  
adverse effects of standard post -transplant medications ;  and graft -vs-host interactions 
or GvHD.  Toxicities, including Grade 4 toxicities, are relatively common.  Non- relapse 
mortality  (NRM) is a definitive endpoint which captures fatal effects of any aspect of the 
transplant process outside of disease relapse, and thus represents the most accurate and reproducible measure of the toxicity and safety of the allogeneic HCT pr ocess.  
The baseline cumulative incidence of NRM after allogeneic HCT for acute leukemia with FLU/MEL conditioning was estimated in a recent large cohort study at 20%  (22).  
In order to ensure that patients are not harmed by [CONTACT_34144], the formal 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_543137].  
The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_543138] [ADDRESS_708920].  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_543139] 5 evaluable patients .  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_543140]:

If the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16510], the study will be terminated, and FDA so notified.  This 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_543141] 80%  power to detect an increase in NRM with a type I error rate 
of 0.05.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_543142].  The rule was created using R  v.3.1.[ADDRESS_708921] s who are enrolled but never treated with ibrutinib ( eg, due to failure to meet the 
secondary criteria to continue to ibrutinib treatment ) will be included in the primary 
analysis, which will be performed as an intention- to-treat analy sis.  However, they will 
not be counted toward the overall accrual goal of [ADDRESS_708922] for AML/ALL at Stanford in calendar 
year 2014.  We will also plan to open this study at UCSF (with [CONTACT_543172]) and City 
of Hope (with [CONTACT_543173]).  We anticipate accruing [ADDRESS_708923] that study accrual will take 1 year to complete.

Assessment of chronic GvHD will be performed using the 2015 NIH consensus criteria 
(23).  The diagnosis of chronic GvHD  requires at least [ADDRESS_708935] 1 distinctive manifestation plus a pertinent biopsy, laboratory, 
or other tests ( eg, pulmonary function tests [PFT], Schirmer’s test), evaluation by a 
specialist (ophthalmologist, gynecologist), or radiographic imaging showing chronic 
GvHD in the same or another organ, unless stated otherwise.  
The follow table describes the diagnostic, distinctive, other features, or features common to both acute and chronic GvHD: 
A Phase [ADDRESS_708936]  has a diagnosis of 
chronic GvHD.  Organ systems will be scored as outlined in the following table:

1. Abstract  (Provide no more than a one pag e research abstract briefly stating the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research. ) 
 
Our mobile application is reinventing the cardiology discharge process to assist the heart attack patient 
in navigating from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65271] e. These patients may have  had a stent placed or by[CONTACT_906271], and they will have had critical medications prescribed to help 
prevent further blockage.  At present, the discharge process for cardiology patients is  antiquated, 
involving last minute paper -based instructions often delivered by [CONTACT_906272]. In this context, non -adherence to evidence -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_906255], and our app is designed t o ultimately change this. There are now emerging scientific 
and clinical data strongly indicating that post -discharge -related complications including medication 
adherence and readmissions can be significantly reduced through interventions initiated prior t o 
discharge, and our app  will maximize inpatient time, engaging patients from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19156] 1.  This study 
has shown feasibility and usability of  our mobile application for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906256] 30-day readmissions . We are also collect ing prospective data on ED visits, medication 
adherence, p atient satisfaction scores, app usability, and patient activation/engagement . Our research 
team  collaborate s with inpatient care teams to assist patients with downloading the app which provid es 
functionality allowing patients  to develop medication self -management skills, coordinate follow -up 
appointments, learn about heart health, and connect with health resources .  
 
2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
Primary objective: To assess time to first readmission  within [ADDRESS_1272572] of care comparison group .   
Secondary objectives : To assess  medication adherence, patient satisfaction scores, app usability, 
patient activation , user engagement , user knowledge, and cost -effectiveness  in patients recovering from 
acute myocardial infarction who use the mobile application . To assess recu rrent myocardial infarction , 
ED visits, observation visits,  and mortality in both groups.  
 
3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, drug or 
device, and any other relevant information to justify the research ) 
 
Nearly [ADDRESS_1272573] to healthcare system is $17.[ADDRESS_1272574]. Seth S. Martin, MD, MHS, PI, has an extensive  clinical research  experience and experience in  
clinically testing mobile health technology , including a blinded, randomized mHealth Activity Trial 
(mActive) , and evaluation of the Instant Blood Pressure mobile application. [CONTACT_56559]  leads the

Participants 
receiving therapy 
when study ends or 
if a participant’s 
participation in the 
study ends 
prematurely  Participants  in the Corrie group will co ntinue to have access to the App  on their 
personal smartphone  after dis continuation of the study or if their participation in 
the study ends prematurely , but will need to return the Apple Watch  after the 
study period . If an iPhone is loaned to a participant , then he or she will need to 
return it after the study period.  
 
 
 
 
 
Procedural steps  Procedural steps for the Corrie Digital Health group:  
 
a.     Patients presenting with  acute  myocardial infarction as the primary diagnosis 
for admission to a  participating site , and meeting other eligibility criteria,  will be 
recruited  
b.     Participants  must be approved to participate in this research study by [CONTACT_5657]/her  
primary care team   
- As resources allow, to make participation possible for participants who are not 
iPhone owners, we will offer a n “iShare” d evice share program  wherein w e loan 
an iPhone along with the Apple Watch during the study period  
- We will also introduce a family and friends program wherein we offer the app 
(but not Apple Watch) to family and friends who have an iPhone and would like 
to use the app for the purpose of supporting the participant  (participant must agree 
and designate the family/friend, including email and phone number, in the app)  
c.    If the participant  passes screening questions for study inclusion (i.e., owns a 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 4 of 10 
 smartphone and not limited from norma l smartphone usage due to conditions such 
as visual, motor, auditory impairment), the participant  will proceed to e -Consent   
d.      e -Consent will be done through ResearchKit  on a study iPad  
e.      The study team member will  be present to guide the parti cipant and  give the 
participant  an opportunity to ask questions before having the participant  sign the 
consent form.  If consent is provided, a Corrie sign will be placed on the door or in 
the room to indicate study participation to clinical staff or an Epi c research flag 
will be placed.  
f.     Next, the study team member  will guide the participant through  download of 
the app, and setup of the app including input ting medications  and profile 
information . Participants will also be given a StartKit (See Supplem ental Study 
Documents) which will include information on how to use the app to reference 
following discharge.   
g.     Consenting participants will be given an Apple Watch , Silicone Healthband , 
and iHealth blood pressure monitor (FDA approved),  and will be  instructed to  
wear the Apple Watch /Silicone Healthband  on their non -dominant wrist . The 
Apple Watch  and iHealth blood pressure monitor  will be paired with the iPhone.  
h.     To promote privacy of health information a login will be required for access 
to app (created upon e -consent)  and the iPhone will be set to password protected 
mode / touch ID activated   
i.     At the time of enrollment, app permissions will be given . In order for an 
application to access any information on an iOS/Android smartphone, the  
application must ask the user for permission and only if that permission is 
granted, can the application access that information. This is inherently enforced 
on all applications by [CONTACT_374511]. In our case we only will ask for 
permissions to acce ss: 
- relevant digital -health data from HealthKit, in particular physical activity and 
heart rate  
- photos to store an insurance card or other card like a stent card; even if the 
access -permission is granted, it is limited to the images specified by [CONTACT_502510] 
- display notifications, such as an alert to take medications  
- a send email function to allow users to send a PDF of their consent form or a 
PDF of relevant health info (e.g., medication list) to care providers; no application 
is allowed to read any da ta from the mail app  
 
j.    Participants will be advised that they will need to return the Apple Watch (and 
iPhone, if loaned)  after 30 days.  They will be  advised that the app can be used 
freely after the study’s conclusion.  
k.     Participants will recei ve $10 (cash, check, or gift card) after successful 
completion of all follow -up surveys (see below).   
l.       At enrollment participants will fill out the mHealth literacy scale  and 
knowledge survey . Participants will also be asked whether they own a home  
weight scale and blood pressure cuff and their perceived value of Corrie.  
m.     All participant s will be emailed a usability -feasibility survey, satisfaction 
survey, and patient activation measure [ADDRESS_1272576] media consent form.  
o.     The study team will also assess the level of adherence based on data 
collected on usage and self -reported medication and therapeutic adherence 
collected through the app functionality  as well as through The Adherence to 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007

 Refills and Medication Adherence sub scale (ARMS). The ARMS will be emailed 
to participants [ADDRESS_1272577]  approximatel y 1-5 days 
depending on length of inpatient admission  and time of enrollment . The objective 
of the study team is to enroll the participant as early as possible in their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
s.    All participants  will continue receiving routine care.  
t.     W hen the study ends or a participant’s participation ends prematurely, those 
participants may keep their app  (in which case their use will continue to be 
tracked) , Healthband, and iHealth blood pressure monitor,  but will be asked to 
return the Apple Watch.  
u.     After study completion, participants will be sent the previously mentioned 
surveys (see Supplemental Study Documents) 3 and 30 days following discharge. 
If at both of these time points, participants don’t respond to the online surveys 
within 7 days  a member of the study team will attempt to obtain their responses to 
the surveys via a phone interview.  
v.     After study completion , participants will participate in a phone interview, if 
they agree, to gather more information about their experience, u sing a 
standardized set of questions (see Supplemental Study Documents).  
w.     Participants may be given the option to participate in future research studies.  
 
Data collection for the Corrie Digital Health group and the historical standard of 
care compar ison group to assess the primary outcome:  
a. Following study completion , we will submit requests to Johns Hopkins 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906257], [LOCATION_005] General 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906258], and Reading Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906259]: age, sex, race, language, body 
mass index, marital status, smoking status, diagnosis of STEMI versus 
NSTEMI, insurance status (payor index), admission date, discharge date, type 
of intervention received in ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (PCI or CABG), a discrete count of 
AHRQ identified Elixhauser comorbidities based on ICD -9-CM and ICD -[ADDRESS_1272578] of

 participant identifiers to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906260].  
d. In an ancil lary study restricted to both groups of Hopkins participants, we will 
perform an Epic data extraction focused on measures of 2018 AHA/ACC 
guideline -directed cholesterol management such as  serum lipid values upon 
admission through 12 months of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190309], whether patients were on 
lipid lowering therapy at the time of admission, prescription of lipid lowering 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_906261] -statins, whether 
the statin was a high intensity statin regimen at the time of hosp ital discharge,  
if patients were not on statin therapy due to a history of side effects, very high 
risk vs not very high risk status,  and whether additional lipid lowering 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_906262] 12 months of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].   
 
Data collection  for patients who were deemed ineligible/declined to participate in 
the Corrie Digital Health group to assess selection bias:  
a. Following study completion, we will submit requests to Johns Hopkins 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906263] 541 patient who were deemed 
ineligible/declined to participate in the Corrie intervention group : age, sex, 
race, marital status, smoking status, diagnosis of STEMI versus NSTEMI, 
insurance status (payor  index), readmission, days to readmission, and reason 
for readmission .  
b. These variables will be obtained via the administrative databases to ensure 
standardization of variables and collection to those who were enrolled in the 
Corrie intervention group.  
 
 
 
MiCORE Reading Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906264]:  
Reading Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906265] a grant from the Reading Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699759]. The 
participation of patients recruited from Reading will be limited to the 30 -day (approximate) initial 
enrollment perio d. The data collected from this cohort will be used to support the study’s primary outcome: 
30-day readmission rate.  
Study procedures for Reading Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906266] e entirety of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906267]. This inpatient phase will last approximately 1 to 5 days, 
depending on the length of stay and the enrollment date, with the goal being to 
enroll the patient participant as early as possible in his/h er hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Then 
enrollment will continue for 30 days following discharge for an approximate 
study duration of 30 to 40 days.

6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.  
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non -FDA approved 
indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant  populations are changed.  
c. Justification and safety information if non -FDA approved drugs without an IND will be administered.  
 
Device s: Smartphone + Apple Watch + Silicone HealthBand  + iHealth BP monitor +/ - Apple TV  
-Corrie is available for iPhone and will be available for Android .  
-The Apple Watch is only available for iPhone users.  
-The Silicone HealthBand is an optional component of the program available to all participants.  
-The iHealth BP monitor is available to all par ticipants through a layered app.  
-As the Corrie app includes Hopkins -approved Emmi educational videos for AMI patients, and there may 
be an enhanced experience by [CONTACT_4317] (possibly along with friends and family) watching these videos 
on the television  monitor in their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223], we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_906268] s to allow the 
participant to AirPlay the video to the television monitor.   
-In discussion with an FDA -consultant , because the functionality of the application  is as an 
organizational a nd navigational tool for patients,  it does not require pre -approval from FDA before use 
with patients. It falls within the category of mobile applications for which the FDA is exercising 
enforcement discretion.  
- Patients meeting the eligibility  criteria  with an iPhone will rece ive the App , and the Apple 
Watch/Silicone Healthband.  Those without an iPhone may be enrolled in the Device Share Program  or 
the Android program when available . 
- The study team will deploy a light -weight silicone HealthBand with the  team’s Corrie logo. It  is a one -
size fits all band with no native technology functionality at this time.  Participants  will be asked if they 
have a silicone allergy prior to offering th e HealthBand. The band is optional.  The purpose of the 
Healthband  is to serve as an inpatient reminder to nurses and the treatment team that individual  is part of 
study and as a “pledge” by [CONTACT_906273].

Study Statistics   
Primary outcome :  Time  to first readmission within [ADDRESS_1272580] discharge  
Secondary outcome : ED visits, observation visits, recurrent AMI, mortality, medication 
adherence, p atient satisfaction scores, app usability, patient activation, 
user engagement, 12-month readmission,  and cost-effectiveness   
Statistical plan including 
sample size justification and 
interim data analysis.  Allowing for 10% of drop -outs during 30 -day follow -up, the aim was 
to recruit N=200 in the intervention group and N=1 ,000 patients in the 
comparison gro up to provide around 90% power at the 2 -sided 5% 
level of significance to detect a hazard ratio of 0.5 (ie, 50% reduction 
in a hazard of the intervention group), assuming 85% of patients in the 
comparison group survive or are not readmitted by [CONTACT_5638] s tudy 
(Stata stpower). The incident readmission rate of patients in our 
historical comparison group admitted to JHH and JHBMC was [ADDRESS_1272581] a 50% risk reduction in 
readmission rates because our solution is comprehensiv e in nature and 
it is estimated that 76% of 30 -day readmissions are potentially 
preventable using proven standards of care.  
 
Our statistics will be primarily descriptive.  We will examine 
characteristics of participants who join the study including 
demograp hics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, level of education, 
mHealth literacy, body mass index, marital status, occupation, annual 
income , insurance coverage ) and clinical characteristics (e.g., severity 
of MI by [CONTACT_906274]/GRACE score, Killip Class, severity of ca rdiovascular 
disease by [CONTACT_390021], medications, cardiac risk factor profile 
including dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_906269] ), hypertension, diabetes , smoking, prior history of MI, and other 
comorbidities such as COPD , anxiety, and depression . We will 
examine primary and secondary outcomes as frequencies (percentage) 
for categorical variables and mean (SD) for continuous variables 
according to site of enrollment (JHH or JHBV) and type of mobile 
device (iPhone or Android). We will  compare baseline characteristics 
of study participants using χ2 and t-tests for categorical and continuous 
variables, as appropriate.  
 
In assessing readmissions and cost -effectiveness, c oncurrent and 
historical controls will be matched to enrolled patien ts based on 
sociodemographic/clinical variables, and risk stratification using APR 
DRG  / severity of illness scores (which are show n in the literature to 
be predictive for readmissions). We will conduct a Cox survival 
analysis to compare time to first read mission between the Corrie 
digital health group and the historical comparison group. We will build 
a Markov model of cost -effectiveness with the perspective of a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906270], taking into account the lifelong 
outcome and cost of the Corrie discharge process versus the standard

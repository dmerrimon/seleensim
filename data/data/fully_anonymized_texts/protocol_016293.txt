2Synopsis
Purpose
Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects over six million individuals globally. With increasing 
life expectancy, this number is estimated to double by 2040. PD patients experience 
cognitive problems, especially executive dysfunction, even in the early stages of the 
disease affecting their everyday functioning. Currently, pharmacological treatment 
provides, at most, modest benefit for symptoms of PD-dementia and there is no effective 
treatment for milder cognitive problems. 
Cognitive training programs in PD have gained popularity with varying degrees of 
success for the cognitive domain that is treated. However, the benefits have not been 
generalizable, and more importantly, not transferred to real-life tasks. Therefore, there is 
an urgent unmet need to develop effective treatment strategies to help PD patients 
independently manage the cognitive demands of everyday life. 
Our previous work using guided motor and visual imagery training showed improved 
motor performance and increased functional connectivity in specific brain networks in PD 
patients. Grounded in this previous work, we now propose a phase 1 randomized clinical 
trial to determine the effectiveness of a 6-week mental imagery training program in 
improving cognitive functions during everyday tasks and to investigate the brain 
mechanisms of this training using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and 
functional connectivity analyses in PD patients. 
Our mental imagery training differs from existing cognitive training programs in 
important ways: It will 1) focus on cognitive functional improvement in relevant real-world 
tasks, 2) foster the development of personalized and practical skills that can be applied 
flexibly to real-life situations, and 3) measure whether the training effects are transferred 
to other standard tests of executive function. 
PD patients (N=120) with mild-to-moderate disease, who do not have mild cognitive 
impairment according to the Movement Disorders Society Level II criteria will be randomly 
assigned in parallel to either the experimental (mental imagery, PD-MI) or control 
(psychoeducation, PD-Con) group. The PD-MI group will practice mental imagery of 
everyday tasks in a supervised manner and via homework, whereas the PD-Con group 
will receive psychoeducation on cognitive functioning and brain health in PD. 
The primary cognitive target engagement outcome will be the self-reported 
improvement on cognitive functioning during tasks of daily life. The primary 
neurobiological target engagement outcome will be the task-specific changes in 
coordinated brain network interactions during naturalistic fMRI tasks that will mimic real-
world demands. We will also examine whether the putative post-training changes in 
cognitive function and functional connectivity will be sustained over a 12-week period. 
Moreover, we will explore whether the functional connectivity changes will predict the 
cognitive outcomes at the 6- and 12-week timepoints. We will use mixed ANOVA tests to 
assess the short- and longer-term changes in outcomes before and after training.
Findings will provide critical early data for longer-term efficacy trials. If successful, 
mental imagery can be developed into a personalized neurocognitive rehabilitation 
program in PD. 
Primary Objective
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether mental imagery training for 
6 weeks will improve everyday cognitive functions and brain functional connectivity during 
naturalistic fMRI tasks in people with PD.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 9/28/2023Protocol Number                                       09/13/2023 Version #[ADDRESS_399950] a phase 1 clinical trial with two groups of PD patients randomly 
assigned in parallel. The experimental group (PD-MI) will receive mental imagery training 
and the control group (PD-Con) will receive psychoeducation on cognition and brain 
health. The mental imagery training will be delivered one-on-one and via audio-recorded 
scripts. Psychoeducation will be delivered in pre-recorded lecture format. Other research 
procedures will include neurological exams, standardized cognitive tests, surveys, and 
MRI scans. The immediate and sustained training effects on cognitive function and brain 
functional connectivity will be tested at 6- and 12-weeks, respectively. 
Study Date Range and Duration
  The expected length of the study is [ADDRESS_399951] at two sites: The Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC) and 
the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI) Church Street Research Unit.
Primary Outcome Variables
1) Quality of life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) Scores
Timeframe: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.  
Rationale: The Neuro-QoL is a set of self-report measures that assesses the health-
related quality of life of adults and children with neurological disorders. Neuro-QoL 
instruments were developed through a collaborative, multisite NINDS-sponsored research 
initiative to construct psychometrically-sound and clinically-relevant health-related quality 
of life measurement tools for individuals with neurological conditions including PD. The 
Neuro- QoL instruments enable within-disease as well as cross-disease comparisons and 
are intended for use in both neurology clinical trials and clinical practice. We will use the 
Neuro-Qol version [ADDRESS_399952]-training self-reported 
changes in cognitive functions.
Change in the Neuro-Qol version 2 Cognitive Function scores from T0 to T1 and across 
T2 will be the primary cognitive outcomes of this study. Significant increase in the 
Cognitive Function scores at T1 will be considered significant improvement in self-
reported cognitive function in everyday life. Significant increase in these scores across T2 
will be considered sustained improvement in self-reported cognitive function in everyday 
life.
2) Questionnaire on Mental Imagery (QMI) Vividness of Imagery Scale scores
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: The QMI is a measure of vividness of an individual’s multisensory and motor 
imagery on a scale of 1 to 7 (1: perfectly vivid image, 7: no image present at all). 
 
Change in the QMI scores from T0 to T1 and across T2 will serve as the manipulation 
check for the mental imagery intervention. Significant increase in these scores at T1 will 
be considered improved imagery vividness. Significant increase in these scores across T2

4will be considered sustained improvement in imagery vividness. 
3) Task-specific whole-brain pairwise functional connectivity
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: We will calculate the whole-brain pairwise functional connectivity during mental 
imagery and video-watching of naturalistic goal-directed tasks in the MRI scanner for each 
subject. 
Change in task-specific pairwise functional connectivity from T0 to T1 and across T2 will 
be the primary imaging outcomes of the study. Significantly increased task-specific 
pairwise functional connectivity in major networks (e.g., default mode network during 
mental imagery and frontoparietal executive network during video-watching) at T1 will be 
considered improved task-specific functional reorganization of these networks. 
Significantly increased task-specific pairwise functional connectivity in major networks 
across T2 will be considered sustained improvement in task-specific functional 
reorganization of these networks.
Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables 
1) Composite executive function test scores (Secondary)
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: We will calculate the composite z-scores of the executive function test scores 
(i.e., Stroop, F-A-S letter fluency, and Trail Making A-B tests) for all subjects. 
Change in composite executive function test scores from T0 to T1 and across T2 will be 
the secondary cognitive outcomes of the study. Significant increase in these scores at T1 
will be considered improved executive function. Significant increase in these scores 
across T2 will be considered sustained improvement in executive function.
2) Local and global functional connectivity-based graph measures (Secondary)
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: We will calculate the local (i.e., clustering coefficient) and global (i.e., 
betweenness centrality) network graph measures during mental imagery and video-
watching tasks in the MRI scanner. These measures will provide information about the 
context-dependent changes in the functional organization of the brain networks. 
Change in graph measures from T0 to T1 and change in graph measures across T2 will 
be secondary imaging outcomes the study. Significantly increased task-specific clustering 
coefficient in major networks (e.g., default mode network during mental imagery and 
frontoparietal executive network during video-watching) and significantly increased 
context-dependent betweenness centrality between major network nodes (e.g., stronger 
between the default mode and frontoparietal networks during mental imagery) at T1 will 
be considered improved task-specific functional differentiation of these networks. 
Significant increases in the same graph measures across T2 will be considered sustained 
improvement in task-specific functional differentiation of these networks.

53) Modified Six-Elements Test scores (Exploratory)
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: The Modified Six-Elements Test is a measure of goal-directed planning and 
execution. 
Change in these test scores from T0 to T1 and across T2 will be the secondary cognitive 
outcomes of the study. Significant increase in these scores at T1 will be considered 
improved performance in goal-directed planning and execution. Significant increase in 
these scores across T2 will be considered sustained improvement of performance in goal-
directed planning and execution.
4) Global cognition scores (Exploratory) 
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: The Repeated Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status 
(RBANS) is a commonly used battery with alternate versions allowing repeated testing of 
the cognitive domains of attention, verbal and visual memory, language, and visuospatial 
functioning. 
Change in total RBANS scores from T0 to T1 and across T2 will be the exploratory 
cognitive outcomes of the study. Significant increase in these scores at T1 will be 
considered improved global cognition. Significant increase in these scores across T2 will 
be considered sustained improvement of global cognition.
5) Post-training brain-cognition relationship (Exploratory)
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: We will examine whether the post-training changes in whole-brain pairwise 
functional connectivity and graph measures will predict the post-training differences in the 
cognitive function in each group at T1 and T2. 
Study Population
  The study population will be people with PD defined according to the Movement 
Disorders Society (MDS) diagnostic criteria with mild-to-moderate PD, who do not have 
mild cognitive impairment, aged 40 and above, and are physically independent.
Idiopathic PD is an adult-onset neurological disorder. In the [LOCATION_002], the incidence 
of idiopathic PD cases before the age of 40 is extremely low. Therefore, individuals with 
PD who are 40 years and older will be included and there will be no upper age limit for 
participation in the study. 
  There is no restriction for gender, race, or ethnicity. The approximate male-to-female 
ratio in PD is 1.5 to 1. This ratio will be reflected in the enrollment. We will seek a racially 
and ethnically diverse enrollment.
Subjects will be recruited through:
1. The Yale Movement Disorders outpatient clinics
2. The outpatient clinics in the new Yale PD Comprehensive Care Center

141 Background/Literature Review
1.1 Background
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurological disorder and affects over six 
million individuals globally. With increasing life expectancy, this number is estimated to double 
by 2040.[ADDRESS_399961] resolution, dual task performance, and 
decision making.9 Apathy and depression are also associated with executive dysfunction in 
PD.9 
Knowledge gap: Executive dysfunction in PD has been established using standard 
cognitive tests, but the functional deficits in everyday life associated with executive dysfunction 
have not been investigated systematically. We aim to fill this gap by [CONTACT_324050]-training changes thereof in PD patients in daily life.
Neural substrates of cognitive/executive dysfunction in PD
Altered resting-state functional connectivity within and between the cognitive networks 
including the default mode, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and salience networks plays a role 
in cognitive impairment in PD.[ADDRESS_399962] been found to 
correlate with reduced functional connectivity in the sensorimotor network, and posterior

15cortical deficits (visuospatial skills, memory) to correlate with reduced functional connectivity 
in the frontoparietal executive network and increased functional connectivity in the temporal 
network.[ADDRESS_399963] demonstrated abnormal 
activation in these circuits and aberrant activations in other brain regions depending on the 
medication status and task features.28 For example, hypodopaminergic state is usually 
associated with reduced activation in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum during planning 
and working memory tasks in PD.27,29 Increased or decreased activation in the prefrontal 
cortex also depends on the basal ganglia involvement during the task.30 Aberrant and 
compensatory frontostriatal hyperactivation has also been observed and is usually associated 
with worse and preserved executive performance, respectively.31,32  
Knowledge gap: The neural substrates of executive functions in PD during tasks mimicking 
real-world situations have not been investigated. We will examine the baseline and post-
training interactions within and between the brain networks supporting goal-directed behavior 
in PD patients using naturalistic fMRI tasks.33,[ADDRESS_399964] once a week with some components administered in individual sessions, and 
usually combined with unsupervised practice (e.g., homework). In a meta-analysis of 
randomized clinical trials, cognitive training in nondemented PD patients was found to show a 
small but significant effect.[ADDRESS_399965] studies focused on the rehabilitation of 
frontal executive dysfunction in PD and the effects were heterogeneous mainly due to the 
variability of cognitive profiles of subjects, small sample sizes, and lack of control groups in 
some studies.40 A multi-pronged program in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
demonstrated that the combination of cognitive, psychomotor, and real-world transfer training 
was superior to any of these components alone in promoting a more active life style and more 
confidence in activities of daily living. Importantly, cognitive training was found to be arduous 
at times and psychomotor training was preferred by [CONTACT_3038].[ADDRESS_399966]-training skill retention, and replicability across studies. 
Knowledge gap: Currently, the cognitive training programs in PD do not fulfill all of the 
Institute of Medicine criteria.2 Specific to the PD population, it has also been recommended to 
include subjects with homogeneous cognitive profiles, target executive/attention dysfunction, 
include supervised training, use a personalized approach, and include measures of 
(instrumental) activities of daily living.40 Our proposed mental imagery training program

patterns during kinesthetic motor46,47 and visual imagery.48 Importantly, the results 
demonstrate that PD patients are capable of mental imagery, can improve their imagery skills 
with practice, and the practice effects can be captured in the functional reorganization of 
specific brain circuits subserving the corresponding imagery modes
Self-regulation and self-efficacy in PD
We also investigated the behavioral and neural corelates of self-regulation and self-
efficacy skills in community dwelling PD patients. Self-regulation and self-efficacy are 
metacognitive skills that enable people to mobilize the motivation and cognitive resources to 
exert control over events 49 and to guide their goal-directed activities over time and across 
changing circumstances.50 These skills correlated negatively with apathy scores and global 
disease severity in our PD cohort. Moreover, a resting-state functional connectivity analysis 
including the main nodes of the major networks (i.e., default mode, dorsal attention, salience, 
sensorimotor, visual, language, and cerebellar) revealed that stronger functional connectivity 
between the salience network nodes including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior 
insula correlated positively with self-regulation and self-efficacy scores. The self-regulation 
scores also showed a significant negative correlation with the functional connectivity between 
the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and left lateral parietal cortex, which is a major node of the 
default mode network (Figure. 2).[ADDRESS_399968] that attentional self-regulation and 
self-efficacy require a salience-detection mechanism in order to switch efficiently from a self-
referential to a goal-oriented mental state. This mechanism seems to be subserved by [CONTACT_324051].

Relevance of mental imagery for cognitive improvement in the PD population
Our mental imagery training will target cognitive/executive functioning in the service of 
goal-directed tasks in everyday life of PD patients. Subjects will learn to mentally simulate the 
planning and implementation steps of these tasks. The training will emphasize the experiential 
vividness and epi[INVESTIGATOR_324029], enable the subjects to mentally 
and affectively prepare for the planned actions, and learn to self-regulate attention and 
executive resources as their plans unfold in real life. The training will be personalized, and 
once acquired as a skill, can be used flexibly in all real-life situations. 
The study will also provide mechanistic insights into the neural correlates of cognitive 
functional difficulties of PD patients using naturalistic fMRI tasks. These correlates and the 
dynamic, context-dependent interactions among them will be the neurobiological targets of 
the mental imagery intervention. Moreover, we will examine whether the potential benefits of 
mental imagery training are sustained in the short term.
Our study has the potential to benefit people with PD directly. Cognitive problems create 
a significant burden on the individuals with PD, caregivers, and public health. Novel treatments 
are critically needed to alleviate the cognitive problems affecting everyday functioning of PD 
patients. If successful, mental imagery training can be incorporated into cognitive 
neurorehabilitation programs for patients with PD.  
2.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact 
The study aims to investigate the potential role of mental imagery training as a noninvasive 
and nonpharmacological intervention to improve 1) goal-directed cognitive functioning during 
tasks of daily living and 2) functional connectivity of cognitive brain networks in PD patients. 
The study has the potential for high-impact findings and direct clinical significance for 
patients with PD:
1) The mental imagery training will be personalized, so that PD patients can continue to 
use the skills and strategies they have acquired during training and apply them flexibly 
and autonomously to real-life situations. If successful, mental imagery training could

19also be incorporated into cognitive rehabilitation programs for PD. 
2) The study will also provide mechanistic insights into the neural correlates of cognitive
function of PD patients using naturalistic fMRI tasks mimicking real-world demands. 
Research on the brain pathophysiology in PD, as a basis for novel treatment options, as 
well as investigation of the therapeutic potential of noninvasive and nonpharmacological 
interventions, such as mental imagery training, has the potential for improvement of the quality 
of life in a considerable proportion of the general older population. 
      Innovations in our study can be summarized as:
Innovations in experimental medicine approach
Our proposal builds on the basic tenets of the experimental medicine approach as laid out 
in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Science of Behavior Change Program report.74
 • This study will, for the first time, use mental imagery as an intervention targeting executive 
functioning to improve performance in goal-directed tasks in everyday life (putative cognitive 
target engagement). 
• The proposed cognitive training program is unique in that it is directly linked to the 
naturalistic tasks of everyday living and promotes an implicit strategy (i.e., mental imagery) 
that can be personalized and flexibly applied to real-life situations. 
• Real-world behavior is complex and multidimensional. Naturalistic fMRI paradigms 
representing real-world demands lend stronger ecological validity to human neuroimaging 
experiments.33,[ADDRESS_399973] time, examine the specific interactions within and 
between core brain networks supporting goal-directed cognitive functioning in PD using 
mental imagery and video-watching of naturalistic tasks of daily life. We will determine the 
changes in the coordinated network interactions as a result of training and how they relate to 
the cognitive changes (putative neurobiological target engagement). 
• Knowledge gained from our empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-grounded and mechanism-based approach will help 
us refine the mental imagery intervention and predict treatment response in PD.  
Innovations in clinical applications
• The proposed training has direct therapeutic implications, and if successful, can be 
developed into a personalized neurocognitive rehabilitation program in PD. 
• The program could also be customized to meet the needs of PD patients with MCI.
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits
2.3.1 Potential Risks 
The proposed research plan involves screening for clinical history, MRI safety, and global 
cognitive impairment; online surveys; neurological and movement examination, cognitive 
evaluation, performance-based tests, training via videoconferencing, pre-recorded 
psychoeducation lectures, and daily homework (listening to imagery audio files and filling out 
online surveys for the experimental group and taking brief online quizzes for the control group); 
and MRI scans. The potential risks associated with individual study procedures are as follows: 
Immediate risks
Medication status 
Subjects who are on medications for PD (e.g., carbidopa/levodopa, dopamine receptor 
agonists) will always be tested and scanned early in the day while they are on their regular 
medication regimen. This will minimize the risk of occurrence of symptoms related to being off 
medication such as excessive slowness or stiffness, freezing of gait, balance problems or falls, 
and severe anxiety.

20Videoconferences for screening and training
The online Zoom platform will be used for videoconferences. There is no medical risk 
associated with videoconferences. There is a potential confidentiality risk (e.g., hacking of the 
conferences or user cameras).
Online surveys and homework
Online surveys and quizzes created on the Yale REDCap online database and survey  
platform will be emailed to subjects individually. Subjects will also submit their homework via 
REDCap. There is no medical risk associated with the online surveys and homework. No 
personally identifiable information will be collected, therefore, the surveys and homework do 
not pose a confidentiality risk.
Clinical, cognitive, and behavioral evaluation 
The clinical evaluation including neurological and movement examination, paper-pencil 
tests for cognitive evaluation, and performance-based tests do not entail any medical risk. All 
of these evaluations will be performed in controlled laboratory settings. No personally 
identifiable information will be collected during these evaluations. 
MRI in [ADDRESS_399974] metal objects in their bodies 
(e.g., pacemakers, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, implanted delivery pumps, cochlear 
implants, shrapnel fragments). Welders and metalworkers are also at risk for injury because 
of possible presence of small metal fragments in the eye, of which they may be unaware. 
Individuals with fear of confined spaces (i.e., claustrophobia) may become anxious during 
MRI. The scanner makes a thumpi[INVESTIGATOR_324030]. The noise can be loud enough to damage hearing. On rare occasions, 
some people might feel dizzy, get an upset stomach, have a metallic taste or feel tingling 
sensations or muscle twitches. These sensations usually go away quickly. Subjects might 
experience discomfort from lying flat on their back during scanning.
Long-range risks
We do not foresee any long-range risks associated with this study.
Risk Minimization
Informed consent and assent 
Verbal consent will be obtained for the screening visit over the phone or via email. 
Electronically signed informed consent will be obtained at the beginning of the video screening 
visit. A member of the research team authorized to obtain consent will give the subjects 
detailed information about the study and go over all aspects of the research. The purpose, 
research procedures, any risk that these procedures might entail, and any possible benefits 
will be discussed in detail in language appropriate for the individual’s level of understanding. 
Subjects will be encouraged to ask questions and given enough time to discuss any aspect of 
the study with the research team. Subsequently, they will have to demonstrate understanding 
of the study procedures and what is expected of them. Once subjects understand the study, 
they will be asked if they wish to participate. If they do, they will be asked to electronically sign 
the consent form. 
Capacity will be assessed directly in the course of attempting to obtain informed consent. 
When the member of the research team authorized to obtain consent has reviewed the study, 
they will ask the subject to explain the major elements of the study. Those elements are a) 
this is a research study (not routine treatment), b) participation is voluntary, c) study 
procedures, d) risks, e) benefits. Open-ended questions such as “Can you tell me the main 
things that you would do in this study? Can you tell me the main risks of the study?” will be 
used to assess understanding and appreciation of the facts. Subject will then be expected to

21make a rational choice: “Considering the risks and benefits we have discussed, would you like 
to take part in this study?” Based on the subject’s responses the team member will make a 
final judgment about capacity for consent. If the subject has capacity and agrees to the study, 
they will sign the consent form.
Subject monitoring 
Subject’s participation will be terminated under the following conditions: 1) Subject 
develops a serious medical condition. 2) Subject is not compliant with protocol evaluations. 3) 
Subject requests withdrawal from the study. Subjects may choose to stop participating in the 
clinical, cognitive, behavioral, and MRI evaluations at any time. During the experiments, the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_324031]. Subjects will maintain their regular medication 
regimen throughout the experiments. MRI scanning will be terminated immediately upon 
subject’s request or if an adverse event occurs.
MRI-related risk management
Magnetic resonance (MR) is a technique that uses magnetism and radio waves, not x-
rays, to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_324032]. The [LOCATION_002] 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set guidelines for magnet strength and exposure to 
radio waves, and we carefully observe those guidelines. Subjects will be watched closely 
throughout the MR study. Some people may feel uncomfortable or anxious. If this happens, 
they may ask to stop the study at any time and we will take them out of the MR scanner. On 
rare occasions, some people might feel dizzy, get an upset stomach, have a metallic taste or 
feel tingling sensations or muscle twitches. These sensations usually go away quickly but 
subjects will be instructed to tell the research staff if they have them. There are some risks 
with an MR study for certain people. If subjects have a pacemaker or some metal objects 
inside their body, they may not be in this study because the strong magnets in the MR scanner 
might harm them. 
Another risk is the possibility of metal objects being pulled into the magnet and hitting 
them. To lower this risk, all people involved with the study must remove all metal from their 
clothing and all metal objects from their pockets. We also ask all people involved with the 
study to walk through a detector designed to detect metal objects. No metal can be brought 
into the magnet room at any time. Also, once the subject is in the magnet, the door to the room 
will be closed so that no one from outside accidentally goes near the magnet. 
Subjects will be asked to read and answer very carefully the questions on the MR Safety 
Questionnaire related to their personal safety. They will be asked to tell us any information 
they think might be important. Subjects will be informed that this MR study is for research 
purposes only and is not in any way a complete health care imaging examination. The scans 
performed in this study are not designed to find abnormalities. Subjects will also be informed 
that the principal investigator, the lab, the MR technologist, and the Magnetic Resonance 
Research Center are not qualified to interpret the MR scans and are not responsible for 
providing a health care evaluation of the images. If a worrisome finding is seen on the subject’s 
scan, a radiologist or another physician will be asked to review the relevant images. Based on 
his or her recommendation (if any), the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_324033], inform them of the finding, and recommend that they seek medical advice 
as a precautionary measure. Subjects will be informed that the investigators, the consulting 
physician, the Magnetic Resonance Research Center, and Yale University are not responsible 
for any examination or treatment that they receive based on these findings. The images 
collected in this study are not a health care MR exam and for that reason, they will not be 
routinely made available for health care purposes.

capturing and sending images are also disabled. 3) All messages are encrypted. 4) Cloud 
recording is disabled. Recordings are saved locally. To ensure security, each time a different 
invitation link with a unique meeting ID and password will be emailed to the subjects 
individually. As soon as the subject joins, the meeting will be locked to prevent others from 
joining. Meetings will be recorded by [CONTACT_324054]. Once the data has been transcribed, the videos will be deleted. Subjects will 
be permitted to record the meetings as well.  Zoom software will be updated regularly to ensure 
that new security features are incorporated.

3.2 Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether mental imagery training will 
improve goal-directed cognitive functioning in everyday life and brain functional connectivity 
in patients with PD.  
3.3 Secondary Objective 
The secondary objective is to determine whether the behavioral and imaging effects (as 
outlined in the primary objective) of mental imagery training are sustained after a 12-week 
period in patients with PD. A final exploratory objective is to determine if there is a potential 
brain-cognition link to predict the corresponding cognitive functional outcomes. 
[ADDRESS_399979] a phase 1 clinical trial with two groups randomly assigned in parallel. The 
experimental group (PD-MI) will receive mental imagery training and the control group (PD-
Con) will receive psychoeducation (see Figure 3). 
Within two weeks of obtaining consent and completing initial phone and online video-
screening, subjects will complete online surveys and arrive for an in-person visit to complete 
the screening process including the comprehensive evaluation of baseline cognitive 
functioning, performance-based tests, and neurological exam. At the end of this visit, eligible 
subjects will be randomized to two groups, PD-MI and PD-Con. 
Within two weeks of Visit 1, subjects will return for Visit [ADDRESS_399980] the mental 
imagery scripts (each 5-10 min) for self-practice on none-training days in the first 4 weeks and 
for daily homework in the subsequent 2-week block. After each daily practice in the 2-week 
block, subjects will be asked to submit a detailed mental imagery diary via the Yale REDCap 
online survey platform. Subjects will also be called once a week in the 2-week block for check-
in.
The control group (PD-Con) will receive psychoeducation 3 times a week for 4 weeks 
regarding cognitive functioning and brain health in PD.  Subjects will receive private video links 
with pre-recorded PowerPoint lectures covering topi[INVESTIGATOR_324034], 
neuroplasticity, attention-executive function, memory, speech-communication, hallucinations 
and delusions, sleep, diet, physical activity, mood disorders, stress, and social bonds. On no-
lecture days and in the subsequent 2-week block, subjects will receive online quizzes covering 
the lecture topi[INVESTIGATOR_324035]. Subjects will also 
be called once a week in the 2-week block for check-in.
Upon completion of the 6-week training, all subjects will return for Visit 3 which will entail 
repeat cognitive evaluations and performance-based tests as in Visit 1, and mental imagery 
vividness rating and fMRI scans as in Visit 2. After Visit 3, subjects in the PD-MI group will be

(e.g., Visit 1).  
4.2 Outcome Variables
4.2.1 Primary Outcome Variables
1) Quality of life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) Scores
Timeframe: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.  
Rationale: The Neuro-QoL is a set of self-report measures that assesses the health-related 
quality of life of adults and children with neurological disorders. Neuro-QoL instruments were 
developed through a collaborative, multisite NINDS-sponsored research initiative to construct 
psychometrically-sound and clinically-relevant health-related quality of life measurement tools 
for individuals with neurological conditions including PD. The Neuro- QoL instruments enable 
within-disease as well as cross-disease comparisons and are intended for use in both 
neurology clinical trials and clinical practice. We will use the Neuro-Qol version [ADDRESS_399982]-training self-reported changes in cognitive functions.
Change in the Neuro-Qol version 2 Cognitive Function scores from T0 to T1 and across T2 
will be the primary cognitive outcomes of this study. Significant increase in the Cognitive 
Function scores at T1 will be considered significant improvement in self-reported cognitive 
function in everyday life. Significant increase in these scores across T2 will be considered 
sustained improvement in self-reported cognitive function in everyday life.
2) Questionnaire on Mental Imagery (QMI) Vividness of Imagery Scale scores
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: The QMI is a measure of vividness of an individual’s multisensory and motor 
imagery on a scale of 1 to 7 (1: perfectly vivid image, 7: no image present at all).  
Change in the QMI scores from T0 to T1 and across T2 will serve as the manipulation check 
for the mental imagery intervention. Significant increase in these scores at T1 will be 
considered improved imagery vividness. Significant increase in these scores across T2 will be 
considered sustained improvement in imagery vividness. 
3) Task-specific whole-brain pairwise functional connectivity
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: We will calculate the whole-brain pairwise functional connectivity during mental 
imagery and video-watching of naturalistic goal-directed tasks in the MRI scanner for each 
subject. 
Change in task-specific pairwise functional connectivity from T0 to T1 and across T2 will be 
the primary imaging outcomes of the study. Significantly increased task-specific pairwise 
functional connectivity in major networks (e.g., default mode network during mental imagery 
and frontoparietal executive network during video-watching) at T1 will be considered improved 
task-specific functional reorganization of these networks. Significantly increased task-specific 
pairwise functional connectivity in major networks across T2 will be considered sustained

27improvement in task-specific functional reorganization of these networks.
4.2.2 Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables 
1) Composite executive function test scores (Secondary)
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: We will calculate the composite z-scores of the executive function test scores (i.e., 
Stroop, F-A-S letter fluency, and Trail Making A-B tests) for all subjects. 
Change in composite executive function test scores from T0 to T1 and across T2 will be the 
secondary cognitive outcomes of the study. Significant increase in these scores at T1 will be 
considered improved executive function. Significant increase in these scores across T2 will 
be considered sustained improvement in executive function.
2) Local and global functional connectivity-based graph measures (Secondary)
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: We will calculate the local (i.e., clustering coefficient) and global (i.e., betweenness 
centrality) network graph measures during mental imagery and video-watching tasks in the 
MRI scanner. These measures will provide information about the context-dependent changes 
in the functional organization of the brain networks. 
Change in graph measures from T0 to T1 and change in graph measures across T2 will be 
secondary imaging outcomes the study. Significantly increased task-specific clustering 
coefficient in major networks (e.g., default mode network during mental imagery and 
frontoparietal executive network during video-watching) and significantly increased context-
dependent betweenness centrality between major network nodes (e.g., stronger between the 
default mode and frontoparietal networks during mental imagery) at T1 will be considered 
improved task-specific functional differentiation of these networks. Significant increases in the 
same graph measures across T2 will be considered sustained improvement in task-specific 
functional differentiation of these networks.
3) Modified Six-Elements Test scores (Exploratory)
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: The Modified Six-Elements Test is a measure of goal-directed planning and 
execution.
Change in these test scores from T0 to T1 and across T2 will be the secondary cognitive 
outcomes of the study. Significant increase in these scores at T1 will be considered improved 
performance in goal-directed planning and execution. Significant increase in these scores 
across T2 will be considered sustained improvement of performance in goal-directed planning 
and execution.
4) Global cognition scores (Exploratory) 
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.

28Rationale: The Repeated Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) 
is a commonly used battery with alternate versions allowing repeated testing of the cognitive 
domains of attention, verbal and visual memory, language, and visuospatial functioning. 
Change in total RBANS scores from T0 to T1 and across T2 will be the exploratory cognitive 
outcomes of the study. Significant increase in these scores at T1 will be considered improved 
global cognition. Significant increase in these scores across T2 will be considered sustained 
improvement of global cognition.
5) Post-training brain-cognition relationship (Exploratory)
Time frame: This measure will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after 6 weeks of 
intervention (T1), and 12 weeks thereafter (T2) from all subjects.
Rationale: We will examine whether the post-training changes in whole-brain pairwise 
functional connectivity and graph measures will predict the post-training differences in the 
cognitive function in each group at T1 and T2. 
4.3 Study Population
The study population will be subjects with PD defined according to the Movement 
Disorders Society (MDS) diagnostic criteria with mild-to-moderate PD75, who do not have mild 
cognitive impairment76, aged 40 and above, and are physically independent.
Idiopathic PD is an adult-onset neurological disorder. In the [LOCATION_002], the incidence 
of idiopathic PD cases before the age of 40 is extremely low.77 Therefore, individuals with PD 
who are 40 years and older will be included, and there will be no upper age limit for 
participation in the study. 
There is no restriction for gender, race, or ethnicity. Parkinson’s disease affects more 
males than females with most studies reporting a male-to-female ratio ranging from 1.[ADDRESS_399983] selection. 
There is no restriction in participation regarding race or ethnicity. We will seek a racially 
and ethnically diverse enrollment. According to the [LOCATION_002] Census Bureau, the 2020 
census demographic data in Connecticut showed the following distribution:79 White only 
66.4%, Black only 10.8%, Asian only 4.8%, Hispanic or Latino 17.3%. The percentage of other 
racial categories was very small. The numbers in the planned enrollment table were calculated 
based on these ratios. 
Subjects will be recruited through:
1. The Yale Movement Disorders outpatient clinics
2. The outpatient clinics in the new Yale PD Comprehensive Care Center
3. The local PD support groups and nonprofit organizations (e.g., American PD 
Association Connecticut Chapter, Beat PD Today exercise program) that provide 
educational and wellness programs for the greater PD community in Connecticut
4. Neurology practices in Connecticut who care for patients with PD. 
5. JDAT recruitment services (EPIC/MyChart alerts & mailing)
6. Department/Center newsletters

5 Study Methods/Procedures 
5.1 Study Procedures
All study procedures will be performed for research purposes. 
Recruitment: 
We will recruit individuals with PD directly through the Yale Movement Disorders outpatient 
clinics. The outpatient clinics in the new Yale PD Comprehensive Care Center will also be a 
source of recruitment. PD patients will be informed about the study during their visit at the 
clinics and provided with the study material. Interested patients will be contact[CONTACT_324056].  
We will also attend meetings at the local PD support groups and nonprofit organizations 
(e.g., American PD Association Connecticut Chapter, Beat PD Today exercise program) that 
provide educational and wellness programs for the greater PD community in Connecticut to 
present the proposed study to potential subjects.    
Recruitment flyers will also be mailed to the providers at the neurology practices in 
Connecticut who care for patients with PD. Letters including study flyers will also be mailed to 
interested candidates.
In addition, the recruitment services at the YCCI will be used. Specifically, we will be 
utilizing the YCCI recruitment database. YCCI has an ever growing “Help us Discover” 
database of more than 14,[ADDRESS_399986] and 
clinical trial recruitment after each YCCI email campaign.
We will also make use of the recruitment services offered by [CONTACT_203744] (EPIC/MyChart alerts 
& mailing) and Department/Center newsletters.
Consent 
Verbal consent will be obtained for the screening visit over the phone or via email. 
Electronically signed informed consent will be obtained at the beginning of the video screening 
visit. A member of the research team authorized to obtain consent will give the subjects 
detailed information about the study and go over all aspects of the research. The purpose, 
research procedures, any risk that these procedures might entail, and any possible benefits 
will be discussed in detail in language appropriate for the individual’s level of understanding. 
Subjects will be encouraged to ask questions and given enough time to discuss any aspect of 
the study with the research team. Subsequently, they will have to demonstrate understanding 
of the study procedures and what is expected of them. Once subjects understand the study, 
they will be asked if they wish to participate. If they do, they will be asked to electronically sign 
the consent form. 
Capacity will be assessed directly in the course of attempting to obtain informed consent. 
When the member of the research team authorized to obtain consent has reviewed the study, 
they will ask the subject to explain the major elements of the study. Those elements are a) 
this is a research study (not routine treatment), b) participation is voluntary, c) study 
procedures, d) risks, e) benefits. Open-ended questions such as “Can you tell me the main 
things that you would do in this study? Can you tell me the main risks of the study?” will be

make a rational choice: “Considering the risks and benefits we have discussed, would you like 
to take part in this study?” Based on the subject’s responses the team member will make a 
final judgment about capacity for consent. If the subject has capacity and agrees to the study, 
they will sign the consent form
Study Schedule
See also Figure 4 for study schedule and timeline. 
Initial Screening: After obtaining verbal consent, subjects will complete an initial phone call 
screening for MRI safety and medical history. If the subject fails the MRI safety screening or 
meets any of the exclusion criteria for medical history, they will be excluded from the study. 
Subjects who are still eligible will be scheduled for a follow-up video-screening via the Zoom 
videoconferencing platform. Consent process will take place at the beginning of this visit. 
Subjects will electronically sign the consent form via REDCap. The screening will be for 
demographic data, global cognition, and functional abilities. We will administer the MoCA to 
assess global cognition.[ADDRESS_399988] scores below the eligibility criteria of our screening, they will 
be excluded from the study and their data will not be used.

Brief description of the tests:
Weschler Test of Adult Reading: Is an assessment of intelligence that has participants 
pronounce [ADDRESS_399992] typi[INVESTIGATOR_20187] 5-10 minutes to complete. 
RBANS: Assesses 5 domains of cognition, 1) immediate memory, 2) Visuospatial/
Constructional, 3) Language, 4) Attention, 5) Delayed Memory. Completion time is roughly 
[ADDRESS_399993]: Is a measure of attention that has the participant read through a list of words or 
naming colors as quickly as possible within [ADDRESS_399994]: Measures verbal fluency by [CONTACT_324057] F, A, and S, within a one-
minute timespan. 
Trail Making Tests A & B: Consist of [ADDRESS_399995] by [CONTACT_43638] a specific pattern in a 5-minute timespan. 
For all eligible subjects: We will administer the Neuro-QoL version [ADDRESS_399996] consists of three tasks (simple 
arithmetic, written pi[INVESTIGATOR_320516], dictation) each of which has two subtasks. The subject is 
required to attempt at least part of each of the six subtasks within 10 min, but without switching 
directly between subtasks within the same task category. The tests assess the ability to create 
and maintain goals and intentions, formulate a plan, organize behavior over time, and execute 
the plan at appropriate times.99 
For eligible subjects in the PD-MI group: We will perform a structured cognitive interview 
to determine the subject’s cognitive difficulties during everyday tasks. Information gathered 
from this interview will help with personalized mental imagery guidance. 
Visit 2: Baseline neuroimaging experiments: Visit 2 will be scheduled within two weeks 
following Visit 1. All subjects will complete the Questionnaire upon Mental Imagery (QMI) 
Vividness of Imagery Scale100 for evaluation of baseline imagery skills. All subjects will then 
perform fMRI tasks in the scanner. The mental imagery tasks will always be performed before 
the video-watching tasks to avoid possible carryover effects from the videos.
Mental imagery tasks: All subjects will receive instructions on how to perform mental imagery 
of goal-oriented daily tasks and practice guided imagery first outside the scanner. Subjects 
will then perform mental imagery of four different goal-oriented tasks in the scanner. We will 
keep the goals constant across subjects, but will not prescribe the specific steps or events. 
After each imagery run in the scanner, subjects will give an account of their imagery content 
which will be recorded.
Video-watching tasks: All subjects will also watch videos of four different everyday tasks (e.g., 
grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], preparing a meal) in the scanner. After each video-watching run in the 
scanner, subjects will answer questions about the content of the videos.
Scanning procedures: We will conduct the MRI experiments in a Siemens Prisma 3.[ADDRESS_399997], T1-weighted high-
resolution MPRAGE anatomical images (voxel size: 1 x 1 x 1 mm) will be collected for an 
accurate localization of the fMRI data. Then, axial, T2*-weighted, echo planar functional 
images will be collected (voxel size: 3.5 x 3.5 x 4 mm, 36 slices, FoV: 224 mm, TR: 2000 ms, 
TE: 25 ms, flip angle: 90). There will be four mental imagery and four video-watching runs 
each lasting 4 min 18 s. During the mental imagery tasks, subjects will keep their eyes closed 
at all times and receive auditory instructions. During the video-watching runs, subjects will 
keep their eyes open and receive visual instructions.

33Training period
Mental Imagery Training: Subjects in the PD-MI group will receive personalized training 
during one-on-one sessions [ADDRESS_399998] 4 weeks. Training will be offered via 
Zoom. Subjects will be guided to mentally simulate the planning and implementation of 
everyday tasks (e.g., going grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]). The training sessions will last about 15-[ADDRESS_399999] 2 weeks for check-in.  
Psychoeducation: Subjects in the PD-Con group will receive psychoeducation [ADDRESS_400000] 2 weeks for check-in.  
Visit 3: Short-term outcome visit. Upon completion of the 6-week training, all subjects will 
return for repeat 1) mental imagery assessment using the QMI, 2) cognitive evaluation using 
a different form of the RBANS and the frontal-executive tests, 3) Neuro-QoL survey, 4) 
Modified Six-Element Test, and 5) fMRI scans while performing mental imagery and video-
watching of the same goal-directed daily tasks as in Visit 2. We will use modified versions of 
the videos to minimize learning effects. After Visit 3, subjects in the PD-MI group will be 
encouraged to incorporate goal-directed mental imagery into their daily life. Subjects in the 
PD-Con group will be encouraged to retain the psychoeducational information.
Visit 4: Long-term outcome visit. This will be the final visit. Twelve weeks after Visit 3, all 
subjects will return for repeat cognitive and imaging evaluations. The same procedures as 
described in Visit [ADDRESS_400001] will be used to enter clinical evaluation results, and

Plan for Grading Adverse Events: 
The severity of adverse events noted during the study will be graded as mild, moderate, 
or serious.
Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events 
In addition to grading the adverse event, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_57185] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). An adverse event is 
considered serious if it results in any of the following outcomes: 
1- Death
2-A life-threatening experience in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929];
3-A persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
4-A congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR
5-Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in this definition.

Reporting of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be reported in accordance with federal and Yale University IRB rules. 
For each adverse event, the principal investigator, [CONTACT_324072], will record the onset, end, 
intensity, required treatment, outcome, seriousness, and action taken. Serious or unexpected 
adverse events will be reported to the Yale University IRB, within [ADDRESS_400004] contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  Electronically signed informed consent 
will be obtained at the beginning of the initial Zoom video screening visit via REDCap. 
Time estimate for initial screening: 1 hour
There will be a total of 4 in-person visits:
Visit 1: Baseline Clinical Evaluation. Subjects will undergo detailed clinical evaluations to 
determine disease severity and level of cognitive functioning.
Time Estimate: 3 hours 
Visit 2: Baseline Neuroimaging Experiments. Subjects will rate their mental imagery vividness 
at baseline and perform fMRI tasks in the scanner. Subjects will also receive instructions on 
their respective training and homework assignments. 
Time Estimate: 2 hours 
Training: Subjects will receive their respective training 3 times per week for 4 weeks. On non-
training days during the week and in the subsequent 2-week block, subjects will complete 
homework.

the study flyer will be used for advertisements. We will also utilize the YCCI recruitment 
database. YCCI has an ever growing “Help us Discover” database of more than 14,[ADDRESS_400006] and clinical trial 
recruitment after each YCCI email campaign.
Lastly, we will also make use of the recruitment services offered by [CONTACT_203744] (EPIC/MyChart 
alerts & mailing) and Department/Center newsletters.

compliance and retention. The Yale MRRC and YCCI are located in the Yale School of 
Medicine campus in close proximity to each other. No other research sites will be involved. 
We will email subjects the video link of a virtual tour of the MRRC and YCCI outpatient facility, 
so that they can familiarize themselves with the research sites (lobby, waiting area, behavioral 
testing rooms, scanner rooms, etc.) prior to their visit. Subjects will also be provided written 
directions and maps to the research site. Parking is always available in two garages near both 
research sites. Subjects who do not feel comfortable driving and have nobody else to drive 
them will be offered transportation. Subjects will be compensated for their participation and for 
travel expenses (e.g., parking, cab ride). 
The one-on-one mental imagery training for the experimental group and psychoeducation 
for the control group will be administered via the Zoom video platform and private video links, 
respectively, eliminating the burden of in-person visits on the subjects. The video visits will be 
scheduled at convenient times for the subjects. Several surveys will also be administered 
online via the Yale REDCap survey platform, which will provide the subjects with enough time 
and flexibility to fill them out. All subjects will also submit their homework via REDCap, which 
will allow us to monitor compliance in a timely fashion.
At the first screening visit, the study procedures, expectations, and the importance of their 
participation will be explained to subjects in detail and all questions will be answered. Plans 
to minimize risk and discomfort and to ensure safety and confidentiality will be discussed, and 
subjects will be encouraged to ask questions. At their first visit, subjects will receive a study 
folder containing brief descriptions of the study procedures, specific instructions for each 
research visit, calendar of research activities throughout the study period, and appointment 
cards. The subsequent visits will be scheduled considering the best availability of the subjects 
to avoid scheduling conflicts. Regular reminders for upcoming visits will be sent via email 
and/or phone. Subjects will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_324060], concerns, or requests. 
In our previous imagery study, the dropout rate was approximately 15%. This included 
subjects who did not complete the study and those who were not compliant with homework 
requirements. The dropout rate was not significantly different between the experimental and 
control groups. All others (a total of 44) successfully completed four research visits spanning 
6-[ADDRESS_400008] a similar level of compliance and motivation, and not 
more than 15% dropout in the current study. We also considered specific factors regarding 
the control group in the current proposal that will help minimize the attrition rate. The control 
group will be actively engaged in psychoeducation tasks during video lectures and will 
complete homework (quizzes). Time spent with staff during research visits will also be 
matched between the experimental and control groups. We will explain to all subjects that their 
effort and compliance will play a major role in their success and potential benefit from the 
intervention. Therefore, we do not anticipate attrition problems related to subject motivation. 
In our sample size calculations, we have accounted for a 15% dropout rate between visits. 
If we experience a higher rate, we will identify the challenges of study participation and 
determine new or additional ways to facilitate retention (e.g., adjust the start time of visits, offer 
meals during long visits). 
In summary, we believe that the study design and logistics, as well as the resources for 
clinical research available at Yale will allow us to reach the recruitment and retention goals of 
the study within the proposed time frame.

405.4 Statistical Method
5.4.1 Statistical Design  
This is a phase 1 randomized clinical trial aiming to enroll 120 subjects with Parkinson’s 
disease (PD) assigned in parallel to the experimental PD-MI (N=60) and active control PD-
Con (N=60) groups. The units of observation are the subjects in these groups. Subjects will 
be enrolled continuously and randomized to two groups using the “minimization” method.[ADDRESS_400011] will be allocated 
to either group considering the factors age, gender, and disease stage. This method will allow 
us to minimize the imbalance between the groups in terms of demographic and clinical 
characteristics while at the same time preserving the randomness of group allocation.
We will use independent-sample t-tests and nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests to 
compare subjects characteristics between the PD-MI and PD-Con groups. 
We will use mixed ANOVA tests with interaction terms to assess the short- and longer-
term changes in cognitive and imaging outcomes before and after training. 
Our overall statistical approach is designed to address the outcomes of four different aims:
AIM 1: To determine the effects of mental imagery training on goal-directed everyday 
cognitive functioning in PD 
Primary outcome: Change in Neuro-QoL version 2 Cognitive Function scores.97
Manipulation check:  Change in QMI Vividness of Imagery Scale scores.100
Neuro-QoL version 2 Cognitive Function scores (Visit 1) and QMI scores (Visit 2) obtained at 
baseline and immediately upon conclusion of the 6-week intervention (Visit 3) will be 
compared between the PD-MI and PD-Con groups using a 2x2 mixed ANOVA with an 
interaction term (dependent variables: test scores, between-subject factor: group, within-
subject factor: time with two levels, i.e., baseline and post-training, interaction: group-by-time) 
(p < 0.05, two-tailed). 
Secondary outcomes: Change in composite z-scores obtained from the executive function 
tests.
We will calculate a composite z-score from the executive function test scores (i.e., Stroop,94 
F-A-S letter fluency,95, and Trail Making A-B tests96) for all subjects. 
Composite executive function test z-scores obtained at baseline (Visit 1) and immediately 
upon conclusion of the 6-week intervention (Visit 3) will be compared between the PD-MI and 
PD-Con groups using a 2x2 mixed ANOVA with an interaction term (dependent variables: test 
scores, between-subject factor: group, within-subject factor: time with two levels, i.e., baseline 
and post-training, interaction: group-by-time) (p < 0.05, two-tailed). 
Exploratory outcomes: 1) Change in RBANS scores,93 2) and change in The Modified Six-
Element Test scores.[ADDRESS_400012] scores obtained at baseline (Visit 1) and 
immediately upon conclusion of the 6-week intervention (Visit 3) will be compared between 
the PD-MI and PD-Con groups using a 2x2 mixed ANOVA with an interaction term (dependent 
variables: test scores, between-subject factor: group, within-subject factor: time with two 
levels, i.e., baseline and post-training, interaction: group-by-time) (p < 0.05, two-tailed). 
AIM 2: To determine the brain effects of mental imagery training in PD.
Primary outcome: Change in task-specific whole-brain pairwise functional connectivity.
We will generate group-level, task-specific, pairwise functional connectivity maps for the 
mental imagery and video-watching tasks using the CONN Toolbox.53 These maps at baseline 
(Visit 2) and immediately upon conclusion of the 6-week intervention (Visit 3) will be compared 
between the PD-MI and PD-Con groups using a 2x2 mixed ANOVA with an interaction term 
(dependent variables: whole-brain pairwise functional connectivity maps, between-subject 
factor: group, within-subject factor: time with two levels, i.e., baseline and post-training,

41interaction: group-by-time). We will use the false discovery rate (FDR)-correction for multiple 
comparisons (p < 0.05, two-tailed).102
Secondary outcomes: Change in task-specific graph-based local and global network 
measures.
Based on the pairwise functional connectivity maps, we will compute the clustering coefficient 
and betweenness centrality representing local and global graph measures, respectively, using 
the CONN Toolbox.53 These graph measures associated with the mental imagery and video-
watching tasks performed at baseline (Visit 2) and immediately upon conclusion of the 6-week 
intervention (Visit 3) will be compared between the PD-MI and PD-Con groups using a 2x2 
mixed ANOVA with an interaction term (dependent variables: graph measures, between-
subject factor: group, within-subject factor: time with two levels, i.e., baseline and post-training, 
interaction: group-by-time). We will use the FDR-correction for multiple comparisons (p < 0.05, 
two-tailed).102
Behavioral scanning data: We will add up the number of key elements of the recorded mental 
imagery descriptions for each scan (e.g., entities, sensory descriptions, spatial/temporal 
references, thoughts, actions, emotions, task components) and average them across scans 
to obtain an average imagery content score per subject. We will also average the number of 
correct answers to content-related questions after video-watching scans to obtain an average 
accuracy score per subject.  The average mental imagery content and video-watching 
accuracy scores performed at baseline (Visit 2) and immediately upon conclusion of the 6-
week intervention (Visit 3) will be compared between the two groups using a 2x2 mixed 
ANOVA with an interaction term (dependent variables: average scores, between-subject 
factor: group, within-subject factor: time with two levels, i.e., baseline and post-training, 
interaction: group-by-time) (p < 0.05, two-tailed). 
AIM 3: To determine whether the cognitive and brain effects of mental imagery training 
in PD are sustained
The primary, secondary and exploratory outcomes as outlined in Aims 1 and 2 will also apply 
to Aim 3. All cognitive and functional MRI tasks will be repeated 12 weeks after the completion 
of the training program (Visit 4). These results will then be compared with those obtained at 
baseline and 6-week post-intervention using a 3x2 mixed ANOVA with an interaction term 
(dependent variables: cognitive test scores and functional connectivity and graph measures, 
between-subject factor: group, within-subject factor: time with three levels, i.e., baseline, 6-
weeks post-intervention, and 12-weeks post-completion, interaction: group-by-time) (p < 0.05, 
two-tailed). A significant interaction will be followed by [CONTACT_324061](s) of interaction. 
AIM 4: To explore the brain-cognition link associated with mental imagery training in 
PD
Exploratory Aim: We will examine the post-training brain-cognition relationship at the 6-week 
and 12-week timepoints in each group. We will test whether the post-training changes in task-
specific whole-brain pairwise functional connectivity and graph measurements will predict the 
post-training differences in the Neuro-QoL Cognitive Function and composite executive test 
scores in each group. 
Exploratory outcomes: This brain-behavior relationship at 6 weeks will be the exploratory 
outcome of Aim 2 and that at 12 weeks will be the exploratory outcome of Aim 3.
5.4.2 Sample Size Considerations
We calculated the sample size based on the primary cognitive outcome, i.e., Neuro-QoL 
version 2 Cognitive Function scores. The Neuro-QoL Cognitive Function validation study with 
120 PD patients who had mild disease (Hoehn & Yahr stage 2) showed mean ± SD = 50.46 ±

patient-reported outcome measures.103
 We estimated the sample size based on the assumption that there will be an average of 
4 T-score improvement after mental imagery training using the G*Power 3.[ADDRESS_400014] size of f=0.266 (corresponding to a moderate effect size 
d=0.53), alpha 0.05, and power 0.80 yielded a total sample size of 86 (43 in each group). With 
an estimated 15% drop out (86/0.85 ≈ 101) during the 6-week intervention period and another 
15% drop out (101/0.85 ≈ 120) in the subsequent 12-week period, we plan to recruit 120 
subjects in total. 
In our previous work with PD patients using motor (N=22) and visual (N=22) imagery 
training, we showed robust task-specific pairwise functional connectivity changes post-training 
especially in the respective motor and visual networks.4 Therefore, we think this sample size 
will also be adequate for the primary imaging outcome.
5.4.3 Planned Analyses
Analysis of executive function and performance-based tests
We will obtain a composite executive function score by [CONTACT_113116] z-transformed 
individual scores on the Stroop, letter fluency (F-A-S), and Trail Making A-B tests.94-[ADDRESS_400015] score 
as the number of subtasks attempted minus the number of violations of the task switching 
rules.98 
Analysis of behavioral data during scanning
We will adopt the qualitative analysis approach used in our previous study.4 We will add 
up the number of key elements of the recorded mental imagery descriptions for each scan 
(e.g., entities, sensory descriptions, spatial/temporal references, thoughts, actions, emotions, 
task components) and average them across scans to obtain an average imagery content score 
per subject. We will also average the number of correct answers to content-related questions 
after video-watching scans to obtain an average accuracy score per subject. These scores 
will then be used in statistical analyses.  
Preprocessing of fMRI data
We will use the CONN toolbox for all fMRI data analysis steps.[ADDRESS_400016] MNI template, and 
smoothing with an 8-mm kernel to account for inter-individual anatomical variability will be 
performed. De-noising steps will include the elimination of signal originating from the white 
matter and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872], regression of motion artifacts and outliers from the time series, 
linear detrending, and high-pass filtering (0.008 < f < Inf). 
Pairwise functional connectivity analysis
To compare the task-specific whole-brain functional connectivity changes between the 
groups, we will perform pairwise functional connectivity analyses using the generalized 
psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) model. We will first convolve the 3-min task blocks in 
each mental imagery and video-watching run with the canonical hemodynamic response 
function. We will use the functionally defined cortical and subcortical nodes (N=268) of the 
whole-brain Shen atlas.[ADDRESS_400017] the average blood oxygenation 
level-dependent signal time courses calculated via the gPPI [INVESTIGATOR_324037]. The r values will correspond to the 
functional connectivity strength between node pairs. We will Fisher z-transform the r values 
and obtain group-level functional connectivity maps for statistical analyses.

43Graph analysis
To compare the task-specific changes in local and global network properties between the 
groups, we will perform graph analyses on the pairwise functional connectivity data. 
Specifically, we will compute the 1) clustering coefficient, which shows the connectivity 
strength between neighboring nodes and is a measure of local network efficiency, and 2) 
betweenness centrality, which shows how well-connected a particular node is with all other 
nodes and is a measure of that node’s potential as an integrative hub.[ADDRESS_400018] Characteristics 
We will perform independent-sample t-tests to compare the normally distributed 
continuous baseline data (e.g., MoCA, MDS-UPDRS) and nonparametric Mann-Whitney U 
tests to compare the discrete baseline data (e.g., symptom onset side, Hoehn & Yahr score) 
and non-normally distributed continuous data between the PD-MI and PD-Con groups (p < 
0.05, two-tailed) using the statistical software package SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics version 
28). If the nonmotor survey data (e.g., mood, fatigue) differ significantly between the groups, 
we will use them as covariates in the mixed ANOVA tests explained above. 
5.4.5 Interim Analysis 
N/A
5.4.6 Handling of Missing Data
We assume that the missing data will be missing at random. If the proportion of missing 
data is not more than 5%, we will ignore the missing data and perform complete case analyses. 
Otherwise, we will use multiple imputation to replace the missing data at follow-up for the 
primary cognitive outcome. Regardless of the proportion of missing data, we will constrain the 
voxelwise imaging analyses to complete cases because to our knowledge, there is no 
validated method to correct for missing data in such analyses.

6.1 Ethical Considerations: Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization
Possible Deception
There is no possibility for deception. 
Payment
Subjects will be compensated for their participation and for travel expenses (e.g., parking, 
cab ride). The in-person visits are lengthy and training sessions require daily time commitment. 
Therefore, we think it is important to reimburse subjects for their time.

physician will be asked to review the relevant images. Based on his or her recommendation 
(if any), the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_324038], inform the 
subject of the finding, and recommend that they seek medical advice as a precautionary 
measure. 
Permanent Medical Records
No information will be added to the subject’s permanent medical records. 
Consent 
Consent forms will be Yale IRB-approved and the participant will be asked to read and 
review the document. A member of the research team authorized to obtain consent will explain 
the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. This 
conversation will take place in a private environment via Zoom.
Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask 
questions prior to signing. The participants will have the opportunity to discuss the study with 
their family or surrogates, or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will 
sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the 
study. Participants will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw 
from the study at any time, without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will 
be given to the participants for their records. 
The purpose, research procedures, any risk that these procedures might entail, and any 
possible benefits will be discussed in detail in language appropriate for the individual’s level 
of understanding. Subjects will be encouraged to ask questions and given enough time to 
discuss any aspect of the study with the research team. Subsequently, they will have to 
demonstrate understanding of the study procedures and what is expected of them. Once 
subjects understand the study, they will be asked if they wish to participate. If they do, they 
will be asked to electronically sign the consent form at the Zoom video-call screening visit. 
Evaluation of Subject’s Capacity to Provide Consent 
Capacity will be assessed directly in the course of attempting to obtain informed consent. 
When the member of the research team authorized to obtain consent has reviewed the study, 
they will ask the subject to explain the major elements of the study. Those elements are a) 
this is a research study (not routine treatment), b) participation is voluntary, c) study 
procedures, d) risks, e) benefits. Open-ended questions such as “Can you tell me the main 
things that you would do in this study? Can you tell me the main risks of the study?” will be 
used to assess understanding and appreciation of the facts. Subject will then be expected to 
make a rational choice: “Considering the risks and benefits we have discussed, would you like 
to take part in this study?” Based on the subject’s responses the team member will make a 
final judgment about capacity for consent. If the subject has capacity and agrees to the study, 
they will sign the consent form.
Subject Coercion 
The voluntary nature of the study will be stressed and reiterated throughout conversations 
with potential participant during the consent process. It will be made clear that the individual’s 
refusal to participate will in no way affect the care which they are entitled to.

a written report within [ADDRESS_400025]. Tinaz becoming aware of the event to the 
IRB. 
Any other UPs that are not life-threatening will also be reported immediately followed 
by a written report within [ADDRESS_400026]. Tinaz becoming aware of the event to 
the IRB in accordance with policy 710.
All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_8706]'s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), 
and the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within 5 business days of the 
IRB's receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator.
Inclusion or exclusion criteria may have to be modified or added safety monitoring 
practices may have to be put in place to mitigate risk newly identified by a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]. Newly 
identified risks will be outlined in the informed consent if changes do not completely address 
the problem. Past participants will also be informed of newly identified risks if applicable. If 
needed, trial enrollment will be suspended until safety measures and/or criteria modification 
can be implemented to address the risk.

CONFIDENTIAL 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1 Disease Background 
2.1.1 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex multi-organ autoimmune disease that is 
characterized by [CONTACT_66867] a wide variety of autoantibodies, especially to 
components of the nucleus, specifically to DNA, RNA, and histones, in addition to red blood 
cells, platelets, serum proteins, and phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  
SLE affects young adults, occurs more frequently in females than males (9:1 ratio), and is 
more common in African American, African Caribbean, Hispanic, and Asian populations 
(approximately 200 cases per 100,000) than in Caucasians (approximately 40 cases per 
100,000). It is estimated that there are approximately 250,000 patients with SLE in the 
[LOCATION_002] of America (U.S.). 1, [ADDRESS_702694] been developed by [CONTACT_204172] (ACR) 4, 5, with a proposed revision by [CONTACT_539250] (SLICC)6.  
SLE is thought to be the result of dysfunction of multiple components of the immune system, 
including defective clearance of apoptotic cellular components, a break in T-cell tolerance 
induction, and generation of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) such as anti-double stranded 
DNA (anti-dsDNA) 7. These ANAs complex with antigens to create antigen-antibody 
(Ag-Ab) complexes which are deposited in various tissues and initiate inflammatory 
reactions via complement activation (e.g., arthritis and glomerulonephritis). Type II 
hypersensitivity reactions can also occur in which antibodies directly target host cells and 
activate immune effector mechanisms that lead to phagocytosis (e.g., hemolytic anemia or 
immune thrombocytopenia). These inflammatory reactions lead to excessive complement 
activation, secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and activation of macrophages and 
neutrophils. 
Currently, there is no cure for SLE. Treatment is targeted at controlling inflammation with a 
variety of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents including mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA), cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], other 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antimalarials 8. Of the 3 types of 
treatments approved for SLE, NSAIDs were approved in 1948; hydroxychloroquine and 
corticosteroids were approved in 1955; and belimumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the 
B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), was approved in 2011 9.

CONFIDENTIAL 2.1.2 Lupus Nephritis 
Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious complications of SLE. LN is a disease 
comprising a spectrum of vascular, glomerular, and tubulointerstitial lesions and develops in 
about 50% of SLE patients within 10 years of their initial diagnosis 10(also see: EMA Draft 
Guideline Feb 2015 11). LN is associated with considerable morbidity, including an increased 
risk of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or renal transplantation and an increased risk 
of death. The prevalence of LN is approximately 74,000 in the U.S. and varies by [CONTACT_545], 
occurring in approximately 20% of Caucasians and up to 60% of Blacks, Hispanics, and 
Asians with SLE2, [ADDRESS_702695] results when Ag-Ab complexes (predominantly DNA-anti-DNA) are deposited in the 
glomerular mesangium and glomerular basement membrane and activate serum complement.
The resulting inflammatory response causes damage to the glomerular epi[INVESTIGATOR_539242]. It is often accompanied by [CONTACT_539251]. Histopathologically, LN can take many forms, ranging from a normal 
glomerular architecture with Ag-Ab complexes identified by [CONTACT_31122], to 
proliferative glomerulonephritis or wide-spread sclerosis of the glomeruli associated with 
end-stage renal disease. The proliferative and membranous forms of glomerulonephritis are 
most frequently associated with proteinuria which often reaches nephrotic levels. LN is 
classified according to the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society 
2003 classification of lupus nephritis (ISN/RPS) (see Section 14.3 ).[ADDRESS_702696] Rheumatism guidelines 15, 10recommend 
treatment with corticosteroids, including an optional initial pulse intravenous (IV) 
methylprednisolone, then prednisone or equivalent, in combination with either MMF or high- 
or low-dose cyclophosphamide, followed by [CONTACT_539252]. 
Approximately 50% of patients respond to these treatment regimens with improvement in 
proteinuria, but only about 25% attain a complete renal response that is frequently defined as 
normalization of proteinuria and stabilization or improvement in serum creatinine, after 
1 year of treatment 16,17. Attainment of complete renal response leads to a dramatic decrease 
in risk of end-stage renal disease 18. Thus, approximately 75% of patients with LN have a 
sub-optimal response to induction therapy. These patients may subsequently receive 
treatment with a variety of alternative immunosuppressive or experimental agents, including 
rituximab, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or other agents, in combination with long-term 
corticosteroids 19. These patients remain at risk for the development of end-stage renal 
disease, in addition to complications from continued treatment with immunosuppressive 
agents and long-term corticosteroids.

one SLE therapy, including oral corticosteroid, immunosuppressant (MMF, AZA, MTX, or 
leflunomide), and/or antimalarial agents, with stable dosage regimen. As these patients 
continue to have active SLE disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_201700], they are in need of an 
effective new treatment. As this is the first multiple dose study of KZR-[ADDRESS_702698] 4 evaluable patients in a cohort 
will depend on review by a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).  
In the Phase 1b portion of the study, a 4-week period of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) 
evaluation for at least [ADDRESS_702699] (with or without Class V disease) will be enrolled to receive KZR-[ADDRESS_702700] and SLE including 
evaluation for improvements in kidney function (changes in proteinuria and estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), changes in lupus disease assessments (Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 [SLEDAI-2K] and, for the Phase 1b only, the 
British Isles Lupus Assessment Group [BILAG]), changes in serum biomarkers of disease 
(ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, anti-ribonucleoprotein [anti-RNP], anti-Ro/La [anti-
SSA/SSB], C3/C4, and 50% hemolytic complement [CH50]), and changes in daily 
corticosteroid use.

responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (such 
as receipt, reconciliation and final disposition records).  
6.2 Study Drug Accountability
On receipt of the study drug, the investigator (or deputy) will conduct an inventory of the 
supplies and verify that study drug supplies are received intact and in the correct amounts. 
The monitor may check the study supplies at each study center at any time during the study. 
It is the responsibility of the study monitor to ensure that the investigator (or deputy) has 
correctly documented the amount of the study drug received, dispensed, and returned on the 
dispensing log that will be provided. A full drug accountability log will be maintained at the 
study center at all times. The study monitor will perform an inventory of study drug at the 
closeout visit to the study center. All discrepancies must be accounted for and documented.

assessment instruments will not be recorded for the brief physical examination unless they 
are classifiable as SAEs.
8.2.4 Electrocardiogram 
A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is to be performed prior to vital signs, following 
[ADDRESS_702701] x-ray that has no 
evidence of malignancy, active infection, or clinically significant abnormalities (unless due 
to SLE) is required for enrollment. 
8.2.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory tests for safety (hematology, serum chemistries, urinalyses, coagulation 
tests, serum pregnancy) and other tests during scheduled visits will be performed at a central 
laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests may be performed at the site using a licensed test.
Abnormal safety laboratory results that are considered clinically significant (or potentially 
clinically significant) should be repeated as soon as possible (preferably within 24-48 hours).  
Unscheduled or additional laboratory samples may be collected and analyzed by [CONTACT_539253]-emergent AEs 
or dosing determination. Unless otherwise noted, when scheduled simultaneously with a 
dosing visit, samples for laboratory evaluations should be collected prior to administration of 
study medications.  
Detailed instructions for sample collection, processing, storage and shipment will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual.

CONFIDENTIAL CLASI
The CLASI consists of 2 scores; the first summarizes the activity of the disease and the 
second is a measure of the damage done by [CONTACT_90050]46. Activity is scored on the basis of 
erythema, scale/hypertrophy of skin and mucous membranes, acute hair loss, and nonscarring 
alopecia. Damage is scored in terms of dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_231727], including scarring 
alopecia. Patients are asked whether dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_539243] [ADDRESS_702702] 
affected lesion within that area for each symptom.  
Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity  
The Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA) is used to quantify disease 
activity and is measured using an anchored visual analog scale (VAS). The PGA will be 
determined on a continuous VAS that asks the investigator to assess the patient’s current 
disease activity from a score of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on a 100-mm VAS, with the 
assessment made relative not to the patient’s most severe state but the most severe state of 
SLE per the investigator’s assessment. 
When scoring the PGA, the assessor should always look back at the score from the previous 
visit. This assessment by [CONTACT_539254].  
Patient Reported Outcomes Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity
Patients will rate their global assessment of their SLE disease activity for the day of the visit 
in response to the statement “Considering all the ways your SLE affects you, please mark a 
vertical line on the scale below for how you are feeling today” using a 100-mm VAS where 0 
is “very good, no symptoms” and 100 is “very poor, very severe symptoms.”  
Patient Global Assessment of Pain
Patients are asked to assess the severity of pain in the past week on a 100-mm VAS with 0 
being no pain and 100 being severe pain. The assessment should be completed prior to the 
painful, tender, and swollen joint count examination. This assessment is part of the Health 
Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). 
Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index 
The HAQ-DI will be used to assess the functional status of each patient.47 This 20-question 
instrument assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks of daily 
living in 8 functional areas (domains; i.e., dressing, arising, eating, hygiene, walking, 
reaching, grip, and outside activities) over the past week. Scores range from 0 (without any 
Kezar Life Sciences  07JUL2020
KZR-616-002 Version 5.0 Page 61 of 96
CONFIDENTIAL difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). The highest scoring item in each domain is chosen. If an aid or 
device is used, or if assistance is required from another individual, then minimum score for 
that functional area/domain is 2. The final scores are equal to the mean of these [ADDRESS_702703] 
scores and range from 0-3, with higher scores indicating greater functional disability.  
8.3 Pharmacokinetic Measurements  
Phase 1b only:  
Blood and urine samples will be collected from all patients to measure the blood and urine 
concentration of KZR-616 (and its metabolites, e.g., KZR-[ZIP_CODE]) as outlined in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section 14.1 , Appendix A).
Blood samples will be collected as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 14.1, 
Appendix A) to measure the plasma concentration of KZR-616 (AUC, maximum 
concentration [C max], time to maximum plasma concentration [T max]), and other PK 
calculations, etc.). At the visits and times specified, blood samples of approximately [ADDRESS_702704] concentration and metabolism and/or 
protein binding will be retained for as long as legally permitted in the country of origin.

blood samples collected as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  14.1 , 
Appendix A, and Section  14.2 , Appendix B, for Phase 1b and Phase 2, respectively).  
CT-L peptidase activity will be measured by a cleavable fluorogenic substrate enzymatic 
activity assay.  
KZR-616 occupancy of individual subunits of the proteasome in whole blood and PBMCs is 
measured by [CONTACT_539255]/Immunoproteasome Subunit enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (ProCISE), a subunit-specific proteasome active site ELISA.

8.5.1 Cytokine Activity 
Phase 1b and Phase 2:  
Blood samples will be collected for assessment of cytokine activity and circulating 
leukocytes as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 14.1, Appendix A, and 
Section  14.2 , Appendix B, for Phase 1b and Phase 2, respectively). 
8.5.2 Gene Expression/Pharmacogenomics 
Phase 1b and Phase 2:  
Gene expression (RNA) profiling and genomic DNA genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_539244]. A whole blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenomic analysis for storage 
and analysis at a later date as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 14.1 , 
Appendix A, and Section 14.2, Appendix B, for Phase 1b and Phase 2, respectively) and to 
the extent permitted by [CONTACT_511484]/or local laws and regulations. 
Samples will be used to conduct retrospective disease or population genetic research as a 
separate analysis not included in this study. Samples will be used to investigate variable 
response to KZR-616 and to investigate genetic variants thought to play a role in the diseases 
under investigation in this study. Assessment of variable response may include evaluation of 
AEs or differences in efficacy. The results may be reported in the separate report.

All samples will be coded with the patient number. Samples and any data generated can be 
linked back to the patient as detailed in Section 4.3.
Biomarker samples donated for future research may be retained by [CONTACT_539257]. Additional consent for storage of samples will be 
requested as a separate approval line on the ICF. Remaining de-identified unused clinical 
samples (blood/urine) will be retained by [CONTACT_539258]’s future 
research, including but not limited to the evaluation of immunoproteasome activity and of 
additional targets for novel therapeutic agents, the biology of the immunoproteasome, and to 
identify biomarkers for response and/or safety.

AEs will be elicited by [CONTACT_99020] a nonleading question, for example, “Have you 
experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?” AEs 
should be reported on the appropriate page of the eCRF.
10.1.[ADDRESS_702706] information (e.g., investigators brochure for an unauthorized investigational 
medicinal product or summary of product characteristics for an authorized product). 
All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be subject to expedited 
reporting. The sponsor and/or the CRO shall ensure that all relevant information about a 
S[LOCATION_003]R that is fatal or life-threatening is reported to the relevant competent authorities and 
IEC/IRB within 7 days after knowledge by [CONTACT_322263] a case and that relevant 
follow-up information is communicated within an additional 8 days. All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs will 
be reported to the relevant competent authorities and IEC/IRB within [ADDRESS_702707] be reported by [CONTACT_68477]. 
10.7 Data Monitoring Committee 
To enhance the safety and integrity of the study data, a study-specific DMC consisting of 
principal investigators, medical monitors, and Kezar Life Sciences (hereafter, Kezar) 
designees will be convened to review the accumulating safety data for the study.  
For Phase 1b, safety review will occur for each cohort as it completes the first [ADDRESS_702708] been 
enrolled and received study drug and progressed to Week 4. Decisions to escalate, expand, or 
modify dose level(s) or frequency will depend on review of safety data by [CONTACT_1363].  
The DMC will review cumulative Phase 1b study data and provide a recommendation for the 
Phase 2 dose.  
For Phase 2, the DMC will convene and review cumulative data on a periodic basis to be 
defined in a separate DMC charter. 
The specific responsibilities and composition of the DMC are outlined in a separate DMC 
Charter. In addition, the details of outputs provided for the meetings will be referenced in the 
separate document.

CONFIDENTIAL Laboratory, vital sign, ECG, and efficacy data will be summarized descriptively (mean, 
median, standard deviation [SD], and minimum and maximum values) by [CONTACT_2715]/treatment 
group and overall and will be summarized by [CONTACT_539260] a 
summary of change from baseline at each protocol specified time point. Changes in physical 
examinations will be listed for each patient and described.  
PK analyses will include determination of plasma levels of KZR-616 including C max, Tmax, 
and AUC.  
All patients who receive any amount of study drug (Safety Population) will be included in 
the safety analyses. Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for 
categorical variables and the numbers, means, SDs, medians, minimums and maximums for 
continuous variables will be provided by [CONTACT_2715]/treatment group overall. 
11.2.[ADDRESS_702709]-dose 
concentration of KZR-616 measured will be included in the PK analysis population. Any 
protocol deviations affecting PK analyses may result in exclusion from summaries for 
individual time point concentrations, complete profiles, and/or PK parameters. These 
exclusions will be reviewed before database lock and confirmed with the sponsor before the 
implementation. 
Pharmacodynamics Analysis Population  
All patients who receive any amount of study drug and who have any measured results for 
PD assessment will be included in the PD analysis population. Any protocol deviations 
affecting PD analyses may result in exclusion from summaries for individual time point 
concentrations and/or complete profiles. These exclusions will be reviewed before database 
lock and confirmed with the sponsor before the implementation. 
11.3 Assessments 
11.3.1  Criteria for Evaluation – Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability is the primary endpoint for Phase 1b and a secondary endpoint for 
Phase 2. 
Safety for the study will be evaluated through monitoring and assessment of all AEs, 
physical examination findings, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, pulse, and body 
temperature), ECGs, and clinical laboratory test results (hematology, serum chemistry, 
urinalysis) including quantitative serum immunoglobulins.  
Kezar Life Sciences  07JUL2020
KZR-616-002 Version 5.0 Page 76 of 96
CONFIDENTIAL Severity of AEs will be assessed using the NCI-CTCAE, Version 4.03.  
All AEs occurring on or after treatment on Week 1, Day 1 through Week 25, Day 169 for 
Phase 1b and through Week 37, Day 253 for Phase 2 will be summarized by [CONTACT_539261], preferred term, grade, and investigator assessment of causality.  
In addition, all SAEs, including deaths, will be listed separately and summarized. Extent of 
exposure to the study treatment will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
Full details of the analyses will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). With 
regard to inconsistencies, the SAP will take precedence over the protocol.  
11.3.2  Criteria for Evaluation – Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Phase 1b: 
Assessment of the Secondary Endpoint:  
Blood samples will be collected from all patients to measure the plasma concentration of 
KZR-[ADDRESS_702710] measured concentration 
(AUC last), and other applicable parameters such as elimination parameters data permitting, 
will be calculated for KZR-616. The PK parameters will be listed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_2715]/treatment group and type of the disease as applicable. Dose proportionality assessments 
and other comparisons such as effect of the type of disease may be performed. 
Concentrations will be listed and summarized for all patients by [CONTACT_539262]. The excluded data will be flagged and explained in the footnotes. 
Urine PK of the drug will be analyzed from urine samples pooled from [ADDRESS_702711]-dose 
(see Section 8.3). Total amount of excreted unchanged and metabolized drug (Ae) and 
percent fraction of dose excreted (%Fe) will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_2715]/treatment 
group and type of disease, where applicable. Exploratory correlation between %Fe and eGFR 
may be evaluated. 
The PK results will be presented graphically as individual and mean plasma concentration 
plots. Statistical models will be presented by [CONTACT_539263]. The details of the analysis will be further described in the SAP. 
11.3.3  Criteria for Evaluation – Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed in both Phase 1b and Phase 2. The extent of 
proteasome activity in whole blood and isolated PBMCs will be assessed in blood samples 
collected.  
The PD effects of KZR-[ADDRESS_702712]-L peptidase activity will be measured by a cleavable fluorogenic substrate 
enzymatic activity assay. The inhibition of proteasome activity will be expressed relative to 
Kezar Life Sciences  07JUL2020
KZR-616-002 Version 5.0 Page 77 of 96
CONFIDENTIAL individual patient matched pre-dose levels in whole blood and PBMCs, representing selective 
inhibition of constitutive proteasome and immunoproteasome, respectively.  
KZR-616 occupancy of individual subunits of proteasome in whole blood and PBMCs is 
measured by [CONTACT_539264]-specific proteasome active site ELISA (ProCISE). KZR-616 
occupancy/ inhibition of constitutive and immune-proteasome specific subunits will be 
expressed relative to individual patient matched pre-dose levels. ProCISE will further 
confirm selective inhibition of constitutive proteasome and immunoproteasome by [CONTACT_539265]-616. 
11.3.4  Criteria for Evaluation – Biomarker and Other Analyses 
Obtain material to assess gene transcriptional and proteomic changes following KZR-616 
treatment including (i.e., RNA) profiling through ex vivo analysis of whole blood and PBMC 
samples. In the Phase 1b, blood samples will be collected on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5, 17, and 25 
(For DNA genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a sample will be collected only on Day 1, Week 1). In the Phase 2, 
blood samples will be collected on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 17, 25, and 37 (For DNA genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
sample will be collected only on Day 1, Week 1). 
The immunomodulatory activity of KZR-616 will be assessed by [CONTACT_539266], including change from baseline.  
11.3.5  Criteria for Evaluation – Efficacy Analyses
Phase 2:  Assessment of Primary and/or Secondary Endpoints  
Please see Section 11.1.2 for a listing of secondary endpoints for Phase 2. 
Rate of renal response will be assessed at 24 weeks. Renal response will be classified as 
complete, partial [50% reduction in UPCR], or no renal response. Summary statistics (e.g., 
total number of patients with observed data, mean, median, SD, min, max for continuous 
endpoints; for binary endpoints: total number of patients observed, number of patients with 
the event of interest, percent) will be provided by [CONTACT_539267] 1b and for all patients 
combined in Phase 2. The primary efficacy endpoint in Phase 2 is percent of patients with 
50% reduction in UPCR after 24 weeks of treatment when compared to baseline. The null 
hypothesis is that the percentage is < = 20%; the alternative hypothesis is that the percentage 
is > 20%. The test of hypotheses will be carried out with an exact binomial test. The 
KZR-616-002 Statistical Analysis Plan contains details of the planned analysis.  
Phase 1b and Phase 2: Exploratory Endpoints:  The efficacy of KZR-616 on SLE will be assessed using changes from baseline in study 
administered questionnaires/disease assessment tools and changes from baseline in 
laboratory measures.  
Kezar Life Sciences  07JUL2020
KZR-616-[ADDRESS_702713] and/or the study will be included in 
all analyses regardless of the duration of treatment. There will be no imputation for missing 
data, unless otherwise specified. 
11.4 Determination of Sample Size  
The study is not powered using statistical hypothesis testing.
11.5 Interim Analysis 
Review of safety data will be carried out after each cohort in Phase 1b as explained above. 
There is no formal statistical interim analysis planned.

2. Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objectives  
Child Participants (Aim 1):  
1. To examine the effects of the Building Resilience Program (BRP) on copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], 
engagement, self-regulation, emotional health, quality of life, and stress in preschool 
participants aged 24 -66 months with history of ACEs  
2. To evaluate the effectiveness of Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) as a measurement tool for 
tracking individual progress and changes pre -post intervention  
Caregiver Participants (Aim 2):   
3. To examine the effects of the Building Resilience Program on caregiver resilience, emotional 
management, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262]  
4. To assess caregiver satisfaction with program methods and outcomes  
2.2 Primary Hypotheses  
Child Participants:  
• All child participants will demonstrate improved copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], engagement, quality of 
life, self -regulation, and emotional health by [CONTACT_647741]  
• GAS will prove an effective tool for capturing individualized therapeutic change in 
trauma -exposed preschoolers  
Caregiver Participants:  
• Caregivers participating in the BRP will demonstrate improved resilience and copi[INVESTIGATOR_647734] -report assessments  
• Caregivers will report high satisfaction with program methods and perceived benefits for 
both themselves and their children  
3. Background and Rationale  
Children living in under -resourced, poverty -stricken neighborhoods face significantly elevated 
risks for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and trauma. The study location serves 
neighborhoods where 36.5 -41.6% of residents live in poverty (compared to 11.9% nationally), 
with 52.8 -54.9% of children living in poverty. The Early Learning Center annual data indicates 
97% of children come from single -parent households, 88% live in poverty, 51% report 1 -5 
ACEs, and 14% report 6 -10 ACEs.  
Preschool -aged children (ages 3 -5) are particularly vulnerable to ACEs impacts due to rapid 
brain development and critical socioemotional growth occurring during this period. Recent 
neurobiological research demonstrates that toxic stress during preschool y ears can significantly 
alter developi[INVESTIGATOR_647735], particularly in regions associated with executive function, 
emotion regulation, and stress response systems.  
The American Academy of Pediatrics identifies the critical need for interventions that build 
resilience and address maladaptive responses due to toxic stress from ACEs. Occupational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_647736] -suited to integrate trauma -informed care into service delivery through their 
expertise in occupation -based interventions, particularly using play as the primary occupation for 
young children.  
4. Study Design  
4.[ADDRESS_867351] control design . *Original program was designed for 
two, 8 -week sessions totaling 16 weeks. Unforeseen circumstances (a flood at the facility) 
shortened the available study period to 14 weeks, so the control condition was shortened and the 
content condensed and combined to maintain intervention integrity.  
4.2 Study Design Overview  
• Phase 1: Intervention Group 1 (IG1) receives BRP intervention for 7 weeks while 
Intervention Group 2 (IG2) receives standard care (waitlist control)  
• Phase 2: IG2 receives BRP intervention for [ADDRESS_867352] care 
activities  
• Total study duration: 14 weeks  
4.3 Randomization  
Participants will be randomly assigned to IG1 or IG2 within each of the four pre -existing 
classrooms using a random number generator, with 5 -6 students from each classroom assigned to 
each condition to eliminate potential bias from natural classroom differ ences.

8. Statistical Analysis Plan  
8.1 Sample Size Justification  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_647739] (n=40 maximum 
enrollment). Post -hoc power analyses indicated observed power below 20% for standardized 
measures due to small sample sizes, despi[INVESTIGATOR_647740]. Future studies require:  
• PROMIS Flexibility (d=0.68): 21 participants per group for 80% power  
• PROMIS Persistence (d=0.63): 25 participants per group for 80% power  
• PedsQL Social Functioning (d=0.53): 35 participants per group for 80% power  
8.2 Statistical Methods  
8.2.1 Primary Analysis - Standardized Measures  
Baseline Comparisons:  Independent samples t -tests for continuous variables to assess 
randomization success  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  Analysis of Covariance (ANCOV A)

• Dependent Variables: Week 7 standardized assessment scores  
• Covariates: Baseline scores, any maturation effects identified in IG2 waitlist period  
• Effect sizes: Cohen's d with 95% confidence intervals  
Secondary Analysis:  Paired samples t -tests for within -group changes  
• One-tailed tests for intervention effects (directional hypotheses)  
• Two-tailed tests for control period effects  
8.2.2 Primary Analysis - Goal Attainment Scaling  
Data Conversion:  Individual GAS scores converted to T -scores (M=50, SD=10)  
Baseline Comparisons:  Independent samples t -tests for GAS T -scores across three domains  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  ANCOV A comparing IG1 (weeks 0 -7) vs. IG2 (weeks 7 -14) 
• Covariates: Baseline domain differences, IG2 control period changes  
• Combined score calculated by [CONTACT_647742] T -scores  
Secondary Analysis:  
• Within -group paired samples t -tests for intervention effects  
• Maintenance analysis for IG1 (weeks 8 -14) 
• Clinical significance threshold: 10+ T -score point improvements  
8.3 Missing Data Handling  
Approach:  Listwise deletion for each analysis Rationale:  Participants included only with 
complete baseline and outcome data for each specific measure Impact:  Sample sizes range from 
n=17 -19 for primary ANCOV A analyses (8 -10 participants per group)

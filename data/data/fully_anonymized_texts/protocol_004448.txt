2. RESEARCH PLAN  
Purpose of Study:  
To compare scar infiltration with 0.5 -1% Lidocaine at a dose of 3 mg/kg (max dose 300 mg) or scar deactivation with 
acupuncture surface release technique to determine which is more effective in reducing pain in adult patients with chronic, 
post -surgical pain related to the site of incision after low transverse Cesarean section  compared to standard of care physical 
therapy with the McKenzie Method . 
Hypotheses, Research Questions, or Objectives : 
● Objective 1 : Compare whether a scar infiltration protocol with Lidocaine is more effective then scar deactivation with 
acupuncture surface release technique at improving pain in adults with chronic, post -surgical pain related to low transverse 
Cesarean section incision.  
● Null Hypothesis 1:  0.5-1% Lidocaine at a dose of 3 mg/kg ( max dose 300 mg) does not reduce pain outcomes acutely and over 
time.  
● Null Hypothesis 2:  Scar deactivation with acupuncture surface release technique does not reduce pain outcomes acutely and 
over time.  
● Alternative  Hypothesis 1 : 0.5 -1% Lidocaine at a dose of 3 mg/kg (max dose 300 mg) reduces pain outcomes acutely and over 
time.  
● Alternative  Hypothesis 2 : Scar deactivation with acupuncture surface release technique reduces pain outcomes acutely and 
over time.   
Significance:  
According to CDC 2015 data, 32% of all births are delivered via Cesarean section1. In patients who undergo Cesarean section, 
studies estimate 7 -18% will experience chronic post -operative pain at the site of their incisional scar2. These statistics indicate  
that up to 1 in 6 out of every pregnancy is at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_600989], and a significant portion of these members will seek care in the primary care clinic.  
Military Relevance:  
In 2016, the Department of Defense employed 1,288,596 active duty service members, of which 15.9% were women3. This age 
range is consistent with peak childbearing age, which  extrapolates to a large portion of the female active duty force with the 
potential to have children during their military careers. Determining whether Scar infiltration or scar deactivation is more 
effective treatments for the reduction of chronic, post -surgical low transverse Cesarean section pain in military beneficiaries 
would  result in less: lost duty days, profiles, and physical fitness testing exemptions in our active duty population, as well as a n 
improved quality of life for all DoD beneficiaries.  Scar infiltration is a technique using high dose and high volume lidocaine to 
infiltrate the scar . Scar infiltration uses 40cc to 60cc of 0.5% to 1% lidocaine, which  is injected throughout the scar with a goal 
of 3-4mg/kg per injection. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a series of [ADDRESS_795892]

   2 Background and Revie w of Literature:  
Existing Knowledge:  The etiology of chronic, post -surgical abdominal wall and/or pelvic pain after Cesarean section has 
multiple hypotheses. These possible sources include development of intra -peritoneal adhesions restricting fascial planes, 
anterior cutaneous nerve entrapme nt, and disruption of the autonomic nervous system within the intracellular fluid matrix 
known as an “interference field”2,4,5,6,7. While there is not a clearly established and widely accepted  pathophysiological cause to 
this post -operative pain, studies h ave estimated  that between 7 -33%  of patient s experience chronic peri -incisional pain after 
Cesarean section with Pfannenstiel incision – a type of abdominal surgical incision that allows access to the abdomen and the 
most common method for performing Cesar ean sections today – defined as pain persisting beyond the period of expected 
healing, approximately 3 months2,7.  
 
Gaps in Knowledge:  Management of chronic peri -incisional pain after Cesarean section requires an extensive workup including 
laboratory testing (CBC, ESR, Urinalysis, STI testing) and imaging (transvaginal ultrasonography and abdominal CT) to rule out 
organic causes5, 6, 8. Once a visceral etiology from postoperative pain has been excluded, there is not a well -established 
guideline dictati ng standard of care, however treatment can include analgesics such as Acetaminophen or Non -Steroidal Anti -
inflammatory Drugs, and in refractory cases suggestive of neuropathic pain Tricyclic Antidepressants, Gabapentin, Pregabalin,  
and Serotonin -Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_600990]5, 6, 8. If medicinal therapy fails to manage symptoms, 
consultation for pain management specialists and/or surgical evaluation is often considered5, 6, 8. 
 
Scar deactivation is used as standard of care  for treatment and  resolution of scar associated pain in patients with a history of 
Cesarean section  by [CONTACT_600999] , both abdominal and/or low back pain that began after the cesarean section . Scar 
infiltration with lidocaine has been used in numerous clinical set tings, masquerading under different names. Referred to as 
“Neural Therapy” in [LOCATION_013], the technique of injecting short -acting local anesthetic into the dermal subcutaneous junction of 
scar tissue has been widely applied;  however there is limited readily a vailable clinical trial evidence supporting its reported 
effectiveness9, 10, 11. Theoretically, it is postulated that the anti -inflammatory effects of local anesthetics play a role in mitigating 
the autonomic nervous system disruption of “interference fields” caused by [CONTACT_601000]9, 10, 11. Local anesthetics promote anti -
inflammatory activity through a variety of mechanisms including  reversibly inhibiting leukocyte adhesion by [CONTACT_601001] -1, limiting leukocyte migration, reversible inhibition of phagocytosis, 
inhibition of phospholipase A2, inhibition of prostaglandins,  inhibition of thromboxane release, inhibition of leukotriene 
release, inhibition of histamine release, reduction in free rad ical formation, inhibition of cytokine release of IL -1β, IL -[ADDRESS_795893]-cell involvement 
(15). In traditional Chinese medicine, injuries resulting in scar tissue formation are thought of as areas of blood and 
subsequently Qi stagnation (16). Disruptions in the flow of Qi at the point of scar tissue can result in abnormal s kin sensations 
such as pain, itching, and numbness in addition to systemic effects16. A case report has demonstrated effective pain relief in 
with an acupuncture protocol utilizing scar deactivation technique16.

3. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Research Design and Methods:   
Active  duty  members  and DoD  beneficiaries,  age 18 years  of age or older,  meeting  the inclusion/exclusion  criteria  will be 
offered  an opportunity  to participate.  They  will be recruited  from  the clinics  located  at Nellis  AFB and Scott  AFB.  All of the 
below  items  are research -related  unless  marked  as ‘standard  of care’:   
 
Pre-Eligibility review : Subjects  who responded to advertisements or recruitment letters or have given their permission to be 
contact[CONTACT_601002] a study staff member to discuss the subject’s  interest in the research study and to receive a 
pre-eligibility screening for study participation. The attached “Pre -Eligibility Review Script” will be used and response will be 
recorded.  If the subject is interested in participating in the study, the study staff member will schedule a screening visit while 
the subject waits on the phone or in -person, in order to confirm the schedule appointment with the subject. Following the pre -
screenin g procedure, the script will be shredded.  
 
Screening Visit:  
● Obtain and document signed Informed Consent document and HIPAA Authorization.  
● Review past medical history to verify the inclusion/exclusion criteria including previous encounter, medication list ( including 
analgesic medication  currently taking), co -morbidities, demographics, and problems list.

   4 ● Record date of birth, age, gender, race, ethnicity, DoD ID, current email address, height (inches), weight ( in pounds -not 
stated weight ), obstetrical history , history of relevant pain and interventions.  
● Instruct subjects to discontinue any current acupuncture treatment at the onset of entering the study.  It is theorized that 
any acupuncture treatment can have a positive or a negative effect on treatment response regardless of the technique or 
treatment indication.  
● If the subject is an active duty member, we will ask:  
o Have you or are you currently on a fitness restriction  for this condition.  
o If so, what are /were  the dates of the restriction?  
 
Randomization:  
● Subjects will be randomized into one of three  research -related treatment  groups using block randomization with repeated 
measures : 
o Group 1: Scar Deactivation Surface Release Technique protocol:  
▪ Alternating placement of Spring Ten (0.30x40 mm)  acupuncture needles to surround scar left in place for a treatment 
duration of 20 minutes.  Needles will be placed at intervals of 1cm to 1.5 cm and will surround the scar with a 
maximum of 20 needles per treatment.  
o Group 2: Scar Infiltration with 0.25 -1% Lidocaine:  
▪ Will consist of calculation of 3 mg/kg dose of 0.5 -1% Lidocaine and a dermal followed by [CONTACT_454234] 
1.5 inch 25 G needle and syringe appropriate for v olume based on calculated dose.  
o Group 3: Physical therapy : 
▪ Will be a referral  to physical therapy specifying McKenzie protocol treatment for the presenting complaint.  The 
McKenzie protocol is a form of standard of care physical therapy in which the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_600991] a cause 
and effect relationship between the positio ns the patient usually assumes while sitting, standing, or moving, and the 
location of pain because of those positions or activities. The therapeutic approach requires a patient to move through 
a series of activities and test movement to gauge the patient’ s pain response. The approach then uses that 
information to develop an exercise program designed to centralize or alleviate the pain.

This study will follow all FDA requirements for the safe use of the acupuncture needles . The Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) regulates acupuncture needles (see 21 CFR 880.5580) as a class II medical device, because they are intended for use in 
the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or are inten ded to affect the structure or function of the body 
of man. The needles being used are Spring Ten 0.30x40mm Acupuncture needles (see figure 1 below ), which are exempt from 
premarket notification by [CONTACT_601003] . 
 
a. Interventions and Observations:  
Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Score (POSAS):  Scar evaluation tool which has been shown to be appropriate for 
evaluation of linear scars, such as the Pfannenstiel  incision, with good reliability and internal consistency . This scale evaluates 
for pain and itching at the scar site, change in color of the skin, change in stiffness or thickness of the scar, change in 
irregularity of the scar and overall assessment of c hange in the scar.  
 
Secondary Outcomes:  
a. Reduction in the POSAS score  
b. Reduction in related symptoms including  
i. dyspareunia,  
ii. decreased libido, or  
iii. Seemingly unrelated symptoms.

Coding Plan?   
Describe the method that will be 
used to create and assign unique 
study codes to data.  The unique study code will be assigned in sequential order beginning with 001 at each recruiting 
site. Subjects at Nellis AFB will be named such as NE001 and subjects at Scott  AFB will begin 
with SC001. The code will be placed in a Master Key of identifiable PHI/PII for each subject at 
each collaborating site  
Describe the method that will be 
used to create and assign unique 
study codes to specimens.  ☒N/A, not collecting specimens  
What is the format of the key?  ☒Electronic  
Who will have access to the key?  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Designated Research Coordinator  at each study site  
Where will the key be stored and 
how will it be protected?  Location(s): Each collaborating site will maintain a Master Key of identifiable PHI/PII that will be 
kept in an electronic database  separate from the coded, de -identified research data , which will 
be encrypted, password protected and the access will be restricted to the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Designated  
Research Coordinator. The Ma ster Key will not be stored on any non -government or personal 
computers or laptops . At the conclusion of the study, the data from each site will be de -
identified prior to review and analysis.  
 
Confidentiality measures: The coded research data will be kept in a locked cabinet in a locked 
office and only the research department has the key. The coded research data will be retained 
until the conclusion of the research study. Once a Final Report has been approved by [CONTACT_1201], all 
the paper records will be de -identified and any key linking the subject to their records will be 
destroyed, based on AFI 33 -332, “The Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program” and the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication (NIST SP 800 -88) for the 
approve d methods to destroy PII. The anonymized research data will not be utilized for further 
research activity beyond the protocol stipulations without additional IRB approval.

4. HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTION  
Recruitment and Consent Processes:   
All potentially eligible patients will be offered an opportunity to participate. Primary Care Manager (PCM) referrals, with t he 
patient’s oral or written authorization, and posted advertisements will be utilized for recruiting subjects to the study. Som e 
patients may be patients of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_83852]; however, they will have another study staff recruit their patients to prevent any 
misconception of coercion or undue influence. When a potential subject is identified by [CONTACT_481803], the patient will 
either be provided a contact [CONTACT_342157], the Research Staff will be given the potential subjects contact 
[CONTACT_601005], or the Research Staff will speak with the patient directly.  It is not standard of care to perform this 
type of acupunct ure on pregnant women.  
 
Consent Processes:  
Informed Consent and HIPAA authorization will be sought in advance of any screening and study -related procedures from each 
prospective study subject and appropriately documented in accordance with 32 CFR 219.117. Potential candidates will be 
notified about  the study either through posted advertisements or by [CONTACT_601006]. The study coordinator will provide a written copy of the 
Informed Consent Document (ICD) . The subject may decline to consent without prejudice. At the subjects’ discretion, they may 
take the ICD home to discuss further with family members or another physician, prior to making a decision. If they decide the y 
are interested in participating in the study, they can contact [CONTACT_481808]. If the subject consents, a copy of the 
signed ICD and HIPAA Authorization Document will be given to the subject. No vulnerable populations are included in this 
research study. Subjects who cannot provide  Informed Consent will not be allowed to participate. No Legally Authorized 
Representatives (LAR) will be utilized. Each subject will be asked to place their de -identified research data into the “Nellis 
Acupuncture Research Data Repository  (FWH20140048H) for future research. If the subject does not give their authorization, 
then the de -identified research data  will be destroyed no later than at 3 years after closure of the study.

Safeguards for Protecting Information:   
The research consents and HIPAA Authorization Documents will be stored in a locked cabinet in a locked room with restricted 
access. All identifiable research data including patient demographics will be kept in an electronic database  separate from the 
coded  research data , which will be encrypted, double password protected and the access will be restricted . The research data 
will be coded and any links to identifiable data (i.e., Master Key) will be destroyed as soon as all data mergers have occurred, 
or no l ater than at the closure of the study, all identifiable patient information will be destroyed based on AFI 33 -332, “The Air 
Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program” and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication (NIST S P 
800-88) for the approved methods to destroy PII. The anonymized research data will not be utilized for further research 
activity beyond the protocol stipulations without additional IRB approval. At the conclusion of the study, the data will be de -
identified prior to review and analysis.  
Data and Specimen Storage Plan  
How will coded or identifiable data/specimens be stored?  
☒ Paper data, including completed consent forms  The research consents and HIPAA Authorization Documents will 
be stored in a locked cabinet in a locked room with restricted 
access.  
☒ Electronic data  Medical records will be annotated with ICD -[ADDRESS_795899]’s participation in a research study , in which 
they are receiving a research -related treatment intervention . All 
research data that includes the Master Key of identifiable 
patient demographics and PHI/PII will be kept in an electronic 
database at each site , separate from the coded research data , 
which will be encrypted, password protected and the access will 
be restricted.  
☒ Long -term storage (following completion of the 
study and inactivation of IRB approval)  The research data will be coded and any links to identifiable 
data will be destroyed (an approved shredding bin) as soon as 
possible or no later than at the closure of the study, with the 
exception of those study subjects that consent to place their de -
identified research data into the “Nellis Acupuncture Research 
Data Repository (FWH20140048H)” for future research . The 
anonymized research data will not be utilized for further 
research activity beyond the protocol stipulations without 
additional IRB approva l. All de -identified research data will be 
maintained for 3 years following study closure.  
 
Safeguards for Protecting Subjects Relative to Reasonably Expected Risks:

5. ALTERNATIVES  
Alternatives:   
Acupuncture and lidocaine for scar infiltration are done in the Family Medicine Residency as part of standard of care. However, 
other medicinal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as Acetaminophen or Non -Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs, Tricyclic Antidepressants, 
Gabapentin, Pregabalin, and Serotonin -Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_600998]. If medicinal therapy fails to manage 
symptoms, consultation for pain management specialists and/or surgical evaluation is often considered. Subjects may choose 
to receive any of these types  of treatment  options  without participating  in this study.  
6. DATA ANALYSIS  
Data Analysis:  
Outcome Measures:  
The primary outcome measures are the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), and the Defense and Veterans 
Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS).   
 
The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale consists of the total score of two numeric scales measured by [CONTACT_5363] 
a qualified observer . Each scale assesses the scar by [CONTACT_601008] [ADDRESS_795901] imaginable condition for that characteristic. The Total Score of both scales is calculated by 
[CONTACT_601009] a range of 6 to 60 . The POSAS is treated as an interval variable; therefore, 
parametric methods will be used for this  outcome17.  
 
The DVPRS consists of an [ADDRESS_795902] for p ain 
measurement throughout DoD and VHA health systems. The DVPRS has demonstrated linear scale qualities allowing 
parametric methods to be used.18, 19. 
 
 
Outcome Measures : 
Primary outcome:  Pain reduction and reduction of DVPRS score. The goal for pain reductions will be 50% as a primary 
outcome.   
Secondary outcomes : Reduction of POSAS score, improvement in related and unrelated symptoms as identified by [CONTACT_601010], and willingness to undergo further treatment . 
 
Sample Size Estimation/Power Analysis:   
The study is organized as a mixed effects, randomized complete block design with repeated measures . Subject is a random 
effect as subjects will have been randomly subjected to C -section from the population of patients obtaining similar care at 
these Air Force medical treatment facilities, randomly enrolled from this population of patients, and randomly assigned to  3  
treatment groups at the time of study enrollment. Fixed effects are treatment group and time of  repeated measure as these 
effects cannot be generalized to other treatments and times.  
 
A priori power was assessed using G*Power Version [IP_ADDRESS].20 Mean (SD) Total POSAS scores for non -hypertrophic scars 
resulting from vertical incisions have been found to b e 21.1 (8.3) and 21.4 (7.4).21,22,[ADDRESS_795903] a 1 SD difference . Mean (SD) DVPRS pain intensity for  a broad sample consisting of inpatients and 
outpatients suffering from acute and chronic pain has been found to be 4.4 (2.4), and will serve as the effect size for this 
outcome.   
 
59th Medical Wing Institutional Review Board  
Version: [ADDRESS_795904] the minimal 
clinically important difference at alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_795905] the minimal clinically important difference at al pha = 0.05. Post hoc tests within smaller 
subgroups may be required, such as differences due to time within a treatment group. Therefore, to achieve a power for post 
hoc tests of 0.95 at alpha = 0.05, a sample size of 45 subjects will be required .  
 
Statistical Analysis:  
Sample and treatment group means and standard deviations will be calculated for normally distributed interval variables and 
medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for non -normally distributed interval variables. Frequency distributio ns will be 
produced for nominal and ordinal variables.   
 
The statistical hypotheses of null effects for POSAS and DVPRS outcome measures will be tested by a mixed effects repeated 
measures analysis of covariance (rANCOVA) . In the event the rANCOVA null hy pothesis is rejected, contrasts will be used to 
investigate effects and differences within time intervals.  
 
In the event multiple comparison tests are used to investigate effects, the Holm method will be used to correct the significa nce 
level of α to p = . 05. [ADDRESS_795906] Matter Expert for Clinical Research Management under contracts 
OMNI 0004 3 -82 and OMNI 0005 3 -126, is the statistical consultant supporting this study. Statistical analysis will be performed

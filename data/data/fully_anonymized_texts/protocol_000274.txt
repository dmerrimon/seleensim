completion, and 75 -90% of patients in the terminal phase of illness.1, 5, 17 -19 Nearly 60% 
of these patients experience  moderate to severe pain,1, 5 for whom opi[INVESTIGATOR_790659].20, 21 Pain has devastating consequences for patients’ quality of life, 
mood, relationships, and functional wellbeing.[ADDRESS_1089933] common reasons for emergency room,22, 23 and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based care.24, 25 Approximately 25% of acute care epi[INVESTIGATOR_790660],10, 24, 25 underscoring need for strategies to bolster outpatient 
management  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_790661] -based treatment guidelines,20, 26, 27 cancer 
pain is often poorly managed.4, 6, 28 Guideline -driven management - which includes a 
stepwise treatment  approach, use of standing and as -needed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], with frequent 
monitoring and titration – is able to relieve symptoms for the vast majority of patients.3 
Unfortunately, cancer pain is often poorly controlled.2-6, 28 Over 40% of patients are 
prescribed pain regimens insufficient for their symp tom severity.4, 6, 28 This may be due 
to clinicians’ underestimation of pain,6, 29 gaps in clinical knowledge, and lack of 
time/resources needed to reassess and adjust management.15, [ADDRESS_1089934] patients are reticent to take opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], they are 
advised to “ stay ahead of their pain”20, 26 – a proactive approach that requires repeated 
coaching. Patients must also cope with  opi[INVESTIGATOR_790662], nausea, 
and sedation.12, 31 Constipation is notable because it is nearly universal and requires 
patients to become facile using and titrating various laxatives, usually with little 
guidance. When management strategies are ineffective, patients frequently avoid 
calling for help, not wanting to “bother” clinicians; therefore, problems are often not 
recognized or acted upon until routine clinic visits. These everyday challenges highlight 
the critical need for interventions to support patients, caregivers and providers in the 
outpatient management of cancer pain.  
Systems enabling electronic symptom self -assessments are a promising strategy to 
alleviate cancer pain.  Patient reported outcome (PRO) assessments of cancer symptoms 
have been demonstrated to improve symptom -related quality of li fe,32-[ADDRESS_1089935] coupled PRO’s 
to self-management support,33, 34, 37, 38 clinician alerts,32, 35, 39 and occasionally to clinician

management recommendations.15, 16, 40 Sadly the application of PRO’s to cancer pain are 
underdeveloped7 due to several critical barriers. First, cancer pain fluctuates greatly based 
on medication use, activi ty, and other factors. To convey useful data to clinicians, 
assessments must be much more nuanced than existing PRO’s. Second, to enable helpful 
management recommendations, systems must accurately capture medications, assess and 
account for their effects. Lastly, new platforms are needed to harness these data to 
generate clinical decision support (CDS) for both patients and providers. We propose 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_790663] -specific PRO’s and 
medication use, conveying this dat a to care teams, and offering tailored management 
advice to patients and clinicians around pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_27293]. The STAMP 
application could be not only an effective tool for cancer pain, but a powerful platform 
for future symptom interventions.  
 
3.0 Objectives*  
 
Overall Research Goal:  To leverage the study team’s expertise in oncology, nursing, 
palliative care, clinical decision support, and informatics, to develop STAMP  
(Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain): a novel mHealth applicati on to 
support cancer patients and providers in the management of chronic cancer pain with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Grounded in Wagner’s Chronic Care Model, STAMP will support patient self -
management through education, PRO assessment and medication reminders; offer 
tailore d decision -support to both patients and providers; and thereby [CONTACT_790699]. Specifically, the study aims of 
this project are to:  
Aim 1:  Develop STAMP, a novel mHealth app to optimize management of chroni c cancer 
pain with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
Focus groups and iterative usability testing will inform functionalities and user 
interfaces. The patient application  will track symptoms, provide multimedia 
education, offer behavioral and medication advice for pain and common opi[INVESTIGATOR_790664]. Importing medications and key clinical data from the electronic 
health record will enable tailored self -management support f or patients, and 
specific management recommendations for clinicians. Within the clinician portal  
of STAMP, a dashboard will present trended symptom data, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and 
specific recommendations for poorly controlled symptoms. Severe symptoms 
will prompt p atients to contact [CONTACT_168198], and trigger clinical alerts. 
Summary reports (with trended symptom data, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -use data, and 
management recommendations) will be distributed to oncologists prior to clinic 
visits, facilitating productive interactions an d timely medication adjustments.   
Aim 2:  Conduct pi[INVESTIGATOR_790665], and their cancer care providers.   
STAMP will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_155923] [ADDRESS_1089936] recently initiated or titrated a short and long -acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_790666]: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)

moderate to severe pain. Patients will use the app for an 8 -week period, during 
which time their symptoms, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], quality of life, use of and satisfaction 
with STAMP will be assessed via 1) app -based symptom self -assessments, 2) 
longitudinal surveys, and 3) semi -structured interviews. Chart abstraction will 
assess patient outreach resulting from STAMP alerts, management changes 
prompted by [CONTACT_790700] -directe d management suggestions; and care utilization 
(e.g. ER visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_736780]). Results will be used to refine the 
intervention, and apply for R01 funding to conduct a randomized trial evaluating 
the impact of STAMP on severity of cancer pain , symptom related quality of life, 
distress, care satisfaction, and healthcare utilization.    
 
4.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*  
 
The eligibility criteria vary for each activity. See section 5. 0 below for more details.  
 
5.0 Protocol Activities  
 
There are 5 protocol activi ties, each detailed in section 5.0.  
• Activity 1 – Content development ( interviews and working groups)  
• Activity 2 – Programming and testing of app algorithms   
• Activity 3 – User Acceptability Testing  
• Activity 4 – Pi[INVESTIGATOR_62701]  
• Activity 5 – Patient Qualitative Interviews  
5.1 Activity 1 – Content development (working groups and interviews)  
**PLEASE NOTE: Activity 1 was originally approved as NHSR via protocol #17 -375.  
As of 7/31/19, protocol #17 -375 is now COMPLETE. All future content development 
activities will fall under activity 1 of this protocol.   
Brief description of activity:  
Since fall 2018, patient and clinician working groups have assisted the project team in 
content development for the application, including development of educational 
materials and survey elements that will be included in the ultimate STAMP application. 
This work has been determined NHSR via protocol #[ADDRESS_1089937] the study team 
in testing  application study assessments  and education . These focus  groups and

Version 8, November 23, [ADDRESS_1089938] feedback.  The interviews will also be audio recorded  to facilitate the team’s ability to 
document participant feedback; however, all a udio recordings will be destroyed after 
comparison to hand -written notes, and will not be electronically stored, or directly  reference d 
during future manuscript development .  
The “About ST AMP/Ap p Roadmap ” document (Appendix U) describes a broad overview of the 
functionalities of the proposed STAMP application.  
 
Participants will fall into one of four eligibility cohorts:  
 
Cohort A =  Patient Content Testing through  semi-structured interviews  
 
Cohort B =  Patient Wireframe Testing  through individual interviews or focus groups  
 
Cohort C = Clinician Content Interviews/ Focus Groups  
 
Cohort D = Clinician Wireframe Testing  through individual interviews or focus groups  
 
Semi -structured interviews with participa nts in Cohort A will focus on the 
understandability and clarity of  application content , using an interview guide  (see 
Appendix L).  Application content includes survey elements , educational materials about 
pain management  and patient educational videos  about pain management and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (Appendices P ,Q, and V , respectively).  These interviews will use standard 
cognitive interviewing techniques to make iterative revisions to survey elements that 
will ultimately be integrated i nto the STAMP application. Up to 20 participants will be 
consented (see Appendix JA) and enrolled in to this cohort, or fewer , depending upon 
when the content is considered clear/acceptable to patients and no new major themes 
arise during interviews . After their interview is complete, participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_1089939].  
 
Qualitative interviews with patient participants in Cohort B will involve presenting 
wireframes (Appendix R) of the application and receiving their feedback on the “look 
and fe el” of the application and their ability to interpret and navigate the various 
screens , using an interview guide (see Appendix L). Participants will be asked to provide 
feedback on the usability and display but will not specifically be asked about content.  
The content in the wireframes will include previously vetted materials, seen in 
Appendices P  and Q. Up to 20 participants will be consented (see Appendix JB) and 
enrolled in this cohort, or until thematic saturation has been achieved. After their 
intervie w is complete, participants will receive at $[ADDRESS_1089940].  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, 2021  
 Page 9 of 55  
Semi -structured interviews and focus groups with clinician participants in Cohort C will involve 
discussing content of the application and receiving feedback regarding the acceptability of that 
content. These interviews will focus on potential patient symptom reports  within the 
application, and reviewing messages that patients may receive in r esponse to those symptoms 
(e.g. to contact [CONTACT_790701]) to ensure that they are clear, 
appropriate, and meet current standards of clinical practice  (Appendix S) . The interviews and 
focus groups will be conduct ed using a guide  (see Appendix M). Up to 20 total clinicians in this 
cohort will participate, either in individual interviews or in groups of 3 -8 clinicians, until thematic 
saturation has been achieved. For this cohort, there will be a waiver of signed consent, and each 
participant will receive a study information letter  (Appendix K) .  
 
Semi -structured interviews and focus groups with participants from Cohort D will in volve 
presenting wireframes of the clinician portal of the application (Appendix T) and receiving 
feedback on its “look and feel” and their ability to interpret and navigate various screens . The 
content in the wireframes will include previously vetted materials, seen in Appendix S. The 
interviews and focus group will be conducted using a guide  (see Appendix M). Up to 20 total 
clinicians in this cohort will participate, either in individual interviews or in groups of 3 -8 
clinicians, until thematic saturation has been achieved. For this cohort, there will be a waiver of 
signed consent, and each participant will receive a study information letter  (Appendix K) .  
Human Subjects Research Category (NHSR, exempt, expedited, full review): All human subjects 
research described in activity 1 is considered exempt . Exempt status for human subjects 
research involving cohorts  A & C is explained by 45 CFR 46.101(b) (2), which states that research 
involving the use of survey procedures (e.g. survey pretesting) is considered exempt as long as 
the research poses little risk to the participants and information is recorded in a manne r that the 
subjects cannot be identified.  Exempt status for cohorts B & D is justified based upon 45 CFR 
46.101(b)(6), because it involves standard procedures used in consumer acceptance studies, 
namely wireframe testing to ensure that the application is laid out in a user -friendly  manner. 
Similarly, these activities are negligible risk and data will be stored in hand -written/typed notes 
and will not include any identifying information.  Audio recordings of focus groups and 
interviews will be used for note -taking purposes only, and will be destroyed after the 
interviews/comparison with note -taking, and will not be stored in study files. All other 
identifiable information will not be captured.  
 
Informed Consent: Written consent will be obtained from all patient participants (Cohorts A and 
B)). Separate consents will be u tilized  for patient  content  testing  and wireframe  testing : Patient 
participants selected for content testing  (Cohort A) will be consented using the patient content 
consent (Appendix JA). Participants who will be testing wireframes (Cohort B) will be consented 
using the wireframe consent (Appendix J B) A waiver of informed consent is being requested for 
all clinician participants  (Cohorts C and D). Instead, these participants will be given a study letter 
(Appendix K ).   
Methods that will be used to identify potential subjects:  All potential participants will be 
identified by [CONTACT_9154]  [INVESTIGATOR_790667]/HCC clinicians.    
 
In addition, under a HIPAA waiver  previously granted for this study , study staff will look in the 
electronic medical record and scheduling systems to identify pot entially eligible patients who 
meet the eligibility criteria for Cohorts A and B .  Study staff may also query Epic,

Cohort D will take part in wireframe testing.  
 
When, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited: For Cohorts A and B (Patients), the 
clinical/study staff will approach patients in -person during a clinic visit to see if they are 
interested in participating  in either the content testing or the wireframe testing .  If a patient is 
interested in participating, the site will have the participant sign consent  (Appendi ces JA or JB) 
and set up a time for an interview.  For Cohorts C and D (Clinicians), t he study PI [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her 
designee will send emails/call/discuss in -person to all potential working group  and/or interview  
participants.  If interested, the clinicians will be given a stu dy letter (see Appendix K) explaining 
the expected participation, they will be given a brief demographic survey and the 
interview/focus group will be scheduled.  
 
Materials that will be used to recruit subjects:  None.

 Page 11 of 55  
Duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects:  We anticipate that it will take six months to 
enroll all participants.   
 
Study design:  Qualitative interview/user acceptability testing .  
 
Description of all research procedures being performed: Participants in Cohorts A and C 
will help test study assessments  and educational content. During interviews, 
participants will also provide feedback on iterations of the developed mobile app  
(wireframes) in Cohorts B and D . To elaborate:  
 
Cohort A  
After signing consent  (Appendix  JA), all patient participants will take part in a one -on-
one interview wi th the study team. The interviewer will show application content 
(Appendices P , Q and V ) and follow the developed interview guide (see Appendix L). 
Interviews will take approximately 30-60 minutes and can be conducted in -person or 
over the phone. Upon completion of the interview, the study team will complete a 
limited structured chart abstraction  (Appendix N) to collect basic non -identifiable 
clinical/demographic information , including the following:   
• Gender  
• Age 
• Ethnicity  
• Race  
• Education  
• Cancer type  
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5536]  
• Treatment receiving  
• Seeing Palliative Care  
 
Cohort B  
After signing consent  (Appendix J B), all patient participants will take part in a one -on-
one interview with the study team. The interviewer will show application wireframes  
(Appendix R)  and follow the developed interview guide (see Appendix L). Interviews will 
take approximately 30-60 minutes and can be conducted in -person.  Upon completion 
of the interview, the study team will com plete a limited structured chart abstraction  
(Appendix N) to collect basic non -identifiable clinical/demographic information , 
including the following:

 Page 12 of 55  
• Seeing Palliative Care  
Cohort C  
After verbal consent and review of the study letter (see Appendix K), all clinician 
participants will take part in either a one -on-one interview or a focus group with the 
study team. The interviewer will show application content (Appendix S) and follow the 
developed interview guide (see Appendix M). Participants will also  complete a brief 
demographic survey, collecting non -identifiable information only (e.g. age cohort, years 
in practice, clinical role) – see Appendix O. Interviews or focus groups will take 
approximately 30-60 minutes and can be conducted in -person or over  the phone.  
 
Cohort D  
After verbal consent and review of the study letter (see Appendix K), all clinician 
participants will take part in either a one -on-one interview or a focus group with the 
study team. The interviewer will show application wireframes (Appendix T) and follow 
the developed interview guide (see Appendix M). Participants will a lso complete a brief 
demographic survey, collecting non -identifiable information only (e.g. age cohort, years 
in practice, clinical role) – see Appendix O. Interviews or focus groups will take 
approximately 30-60 minutes and can be conducted in -person or o ver the phone.  
 
Monitor subjects for safety or minimize risks:  The risk to participants is minimal with the 
primary risk being loss of confidentiality/privacy. To monitor the risk of loss of 
confidentiality/privacy, the study team will ensure that the STAMP app is HIPPA compliant and 
meet the privacy and security stan dards set by [CONTACT_102927]/HCC. In addition, all collected study data will 
be maintained in a secure location and personal identifiers will be removed.  
 
What data will be collected and how:   
• Interview data: Verbal feedback will be collected from all focus group and interview 
participants regarding their understanding and acceptability of survey elements, other 
app content, and app wireframes.  A study team member will take hand -written and/or 
typed notes of all interviews/focus groups. Additionally, these interviews w ill be audio -
recorded  to supplement and confirm accuracy of hand -written notes . Audio recordings 
will be destroyed immediately after comparison to hand -written notes  (within 5 
business day s of the actual interview), will not be stored on any physical or vi rtual file , 
and will not be directly referenced during future manuscript development .   
• Demographic surveys: Cohorts C & D (clinicians) will complete a brief survey (Appendix 
O) assessing demographic and professional characteristics (e.g. clinical role, age cohort, 
years in practice), without any direct or indirect identifiers.  
• Chart abstraction: for cohorts A & B (patients), the team will complete a limited 
structured chart abstraction (Appendix N) to collect basic non -identifiable 
clinical/demogra phic information (e.g. age cohort, diagnosis, etc.)  
  
Long -term follow -up: Not applicable for this activity.

o Basics of pain psychology  
• Education about specific medications will be linked to pat ients’ 
“medicine cabinet” function  
• Educational content will be pushed to patients based on their 
daily symptom reporting. This includes advice to call care 
providers for any severe symptoms.  
o  
▪ The clinician facing portal is deigned to be monitored by a clinic nurse, 
and will include :

o Clinician -facing training materials (when and how to use STAMP ). 
• The final STAMP app  will be HIPPA compliant and compliant with DFCI security and 
privacy standards   
• During  the app build, graphics designers will develop wire frames for the STAMP user 
interfaces. The study team will present these wire frames to the participants in the 
study work groups (outlined in Activity  1). Group participants will review the wireframes 
and provide feedback on their visual appeal, readability, ease of navigation, and 
usefulness. Results will be used to modify the wireframes, which will be re -tested if 
necessary , prior to programming the STAMP application.

SYMPTOM EDUCATION FOR PATIENTS (selected examples adapted from ACS)  
Talk with your cancer team about your pain  – where it is, when it began, how long it lasts, what it feels 
like, what makes it bette r, what makes it worse, and how it affects your life.  
Take your pain medicine exactly as prescribed. Check with your cancer team if this schedule needs to 
be adjusted.  
As the pain is relieved with medicines, increase your activity level.  
Don’t wait until the pain is severe  before taking medicine for breakthrough pain.  
Keep track of any other side effects  that you notice. Discuss them with your cancer team.  
Call your cancer team if:  1) you have new or worse pain, 2) you can’t take anything by [CONTACT_1966], including 
the pain medicine, 3) you do not receive any pain relief, or 4) you become constipated, nauseated or 
confused.

5.3 Activity 3 – User Acceptability Testing  and Focus Groups   
 
Brief description of activity:  Once the application has been built, the study team will 
conduct laboratory user acceptability testing and field user acceptability testing (UAT). 
UAT will be conduct ed through individual interviews with patients and oncology 
providers. This activity will allow the study team to test the preliminary application in 
both laboratory and “real life” environments, in order to solve any unforeseen 
programming and design chal lenges before conducting a pi[INVESTIGATOR_583308] .

 Page 19 of 55  
When, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited:   
Cohort s A & B:  Potentially eligible patients will be identified by 1) referrals from clinic staff, or 2) 
by [CONTACT_790704]. Once the study team identifies a potentially eligible patient, th e team will reach out 
to the treating clinician for permission to approach.  
 
Once approved to approach, the clinical/study staff will approach patients in -person during a 
clinic visit to see if they are interested in participating. Alternatively, the study staff can send 
eligible patients an introduction to the study via mail/email and call them to offer participation 
(Appendices VA or VB ). 
 
Interested participants will then  review the study letter with a research team member 
(Append ix VA  or VB) and if interested provide verbal consent.  Next, they will  set up a time for 
the interview (Cohort A) or initial study visit (Cohort B).  
 
Cohort C: Clinicians will be recruited through interactions with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or email 
invitation fro m the study team. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee will send emails/call/discuss in -
person to all potential interview participants. If interested, the clinicians will be given a study 
letter ( Appendix VC) explaining the expected participation and the interview/focus group wi ll be 
scheduled.  
 
Materials that will be used to recruit subjects: See Appendices VA and VB  for study letters for 
Cohorts A and B . 
 
Duration of subject’s participation in the study:   
• Cohort A:  Patient  Laboratory UAT  and qualitative debriefing interviews will take 
approximately 30-60 minutes , and will occur in person , over the phone,  or via a compliant 
and secure video chat/screen -share platform (i.e. Zoom) . 
• Cohort B: Patient  UAT Field study will include patients using  the application at home for 
up to one week  at home . The initial study visit will occur in -person or via phone or secure 
video chat/screen -share platform (i.e. Zoom ) and will take about [ADDRESS_1089946] been 
designed to take no more than 5 minutes , and to review tailored feedback/symptom 
education that the app provides in response to reported symptoms . Patients can spend as 
long as they want to review education content  also provided on the app . It is expected 
that it will take patients 1 minute to review brief pearls and 5-15 minutes to review  more 
in-depth  content  (optiona l). Upon completion of the field UAT, participants will complete 
an in -person  or over the phone  interview with the study team which will take 
approximately 30 minutes.  
• Cohort C:  Clinician Laboratory UAT will  take approximately 30-60 minutes  and will occur 
either in -person, over the phone, or via a compliant and secure video chat/screen -share 
platform (i.e. Zoom).  
 
Duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects: We anticipate that it will take three  to six  
months to enroll all UAT participants.  Analysis will start after the first patient is enrolled and 
continue after completion of all activities as needed to revise the application.

Study design: Qualitative interview s/user acceptability testing   
 
Descript ion of all research procedures being performed:  
Cohort A – Patient Lab UAT : After providing consent, participants will schedule 
a time to take part in the study interview. Next, the interview will be conducted with the 
internal study team in a private room  in DFCI, or remotely via a HIPPA -compliant secure 
video -chat platform (i.e. Zoom). Participants will be provided a study phone with the 
application already downloaded onto it, or they will be provided a link to temporarily 
download the STAMP application o nto their own phone (depending upon patient 
preference).  Participants will be recorded while  asked to “think aloud” for [ADDRESS_1089947] common health technology UAT method, 
identifying >70% of usability problems within the first few interviews. 104,105 Verbal/non -
verbal data will be transcribed and analyzed qualitatively to identify themes rel ated to 
usability concerns and in response to open -ended questions about the app . 
 
Participants will then be guided through a semi -structured interview about the usability 
and acceptability of the application and  subsequently  complete a validated usability 
survey (the e -acceptability scale) (Appendix ZA). Medical record abstraction will then be 
completed for each enrolled participant (Appendix XA). 
 
Detailed qualitative analysis is not appropriate for this aim. Rather, the goal is to identify and 
address any problems with the proposed application. Iterative revisions will occur in response to 
these themes, after which we will enroll additional patient s. UAT will continue until no new 
themes emerge and usability scores are > 3 out of 5. We anticipate conducting UAT with 5 -6 
patient participants, and no more than 12 participants. Each participant will receive a $[ADDRESS_1089948] upon completion of the study activity.  
 
Cohort B – Patient Field UAT:  After completion of testing with Cohort A and 
modifying the application in response, the study team will conduct field testing with up to 
12 participants. Participants in Cohort B will be asked to use the STAMP app at home for 
up to a week (on their own mobile device), which involves completing daily symptom 
assessments within the app and reviewing educational resources within the app as 
desired.  
During the first study visit (remote or in -person), patients will down load the app on their 
personal device using a secure email or text link, with assistance from the research 
assistant (RA) as needed. The RA will then review the primary app features and 
familiarize the participant to symptom reports and app capabilities. T he RA and study 
nurse will input the participant’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_173681], other pain medications, and laxative 
medications to the “medic ine cabinet” feature of the app. All medications will be 
reviewed with the patient and reconciled by [CONTACT_790705].  
The participant will then be asked to use the app on their own smartphone through this 
“test” phase, for up to one week at home. Use during this week will include completing a 
daily symptom survey (estimated to take <5 minutes) on the app a nd reviewing 
educational content they receive within the app in response to their surveys. Of note, if 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, [ADDRESS_1089949] their clinical team (see Table [ADDRESS_1089950] of  severe symptoms).  
Following participant’s use of the app at home, we will conduct an interview with them 
to evaluate perceived app functionality, usability, and acceptability, and complete 
modifications to the application (Appendix ZB). Interviews will be recorded for note -
taking purposes. Each participant will receive a $[ADDRESS_1089951] upo n completion of the 
study activity.  
A study research nurse from the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center (GCC) will monitor 
cohort B’s app -reported symptoms within a web -based portal on a daily basis. The portal 
includes a color -coded system to highlight poorly controlled symptoms, allowing for 
more proactive outreach to patients. It also presents patients’ symptom and medication -
use data, facilitating triage calls and changes in management. This nurse who monitors 
the portal is part of the nurse navigators team for the GCC, and during usual care would 
be part of the team of people who contact [CONTACT_790706]/symptoms and 
coordinate management decision. The nurse will follow usual clinical judgement 
regarding patient outreach and management changes and will notify participants’ care 
team (i.e. physician or mid -level provider) if they think that further medical work -up or 
medication changes are required based upon reported symptoms.  
 
A structured medical record abstraction will be completed for each e nrolled participant at the 
end of the study period to assess any clinical interactions (i.e. phone calls, clinic visits), 
healthcare utilization (i.e. ER visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_790674]), or changes in pain/symptom 
management over the one -week study peri od and the week after (Appendix XB). 
 
Cohort C: Clinician Lab UAT:  Concurrent to Cohort A testing, we will conduct UAT of the 
web -based clinician portal of the application with relevant clinicians. With similar methodology 
to Lab UAT for Cohort A, up to 10 clinicians will “think aloud” while reviewing the clinician 
interf aces of STAMP (pre -populated with a set of test cases, not real patient data). Clinicians will 
be directly observed by [CONTACT_193152] a secure video -based screen -sharing platform (i.e. 
Zoom), or in person. Sessions will be recorded to assist with not e taking. Following “think aloud” 
testing, clinicians will undergo a brief semi -structured debriefing interview and complete a 
validated usability survey (modified acceptability e -scale) (Appendix ZC). Clinicians will also 
complete a demographics survey (A ppendix Y). 
 
Findings will inform iterative revisions with repeat testing as needed. If common barriers are 
observed, the tool will be modified and repeat field UAT will be conducted until STAMP is found 
to be usable to most patients and providers.  
 
Monito r subjects for safety or minimize risks:  
The risks to participants in cohorts A, B, and C are minimal. The primary risk is loss of 
confidentiality/privacy. To monitor the risk of loss of confidentiality/privacy, the study team will 
ensure that the STAMP ap p is HIPPA compliant and meet the privacy and security standards set 
by [CONTACT_102927]/HCC. In addition, all collected study data will be maintained in a secure location and 
personal identifiers will be removed. As described above, UAT interviews will be recorded for 
the purpose of note -taking only, and will be destroyed as soon analysis concludes.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, [ADDRESS_1089952], the applic ation has clear disclaimers that the 
portal is not monitored continuously, and that it should not substitute calling care teams for 
worrisome symptoms. Secondly, when patients report potentially serious symptoms , they are 
specifically instructed to notify their care team by [CONTACT_736800] (the clinic 
number is included in the application). See below for the list of symptoms that prompts phone 
contact:   
 
[CONTACT_50489] 5. Severe Symptoms  
Pain • Worst pain = 9 -10 
• Worst pain = 7 -10 and new pain  
Red Flag Symptoms  • Severe weakness or fatigue  
• Lightheadedness or feeling like I was going to pass out  
• No gas or stool from my bottom (or ostomy) in the last 2 days  
• Vomiting [ADDRESS_1089953] 24 hours  
• Fever of 100.5 or greater  
• New or worsening chest pa in 
• New or worsening shortness of breath  
• New or worsening back pain  
• New numbness and weakness in one or both of your legs  
• Severe difficulty eating or drinking  
• Hallucinations/nightmares  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_378428]  • Hallucinations  
Constipation  • No bowel movement in four days  
• Haven’t passed gas from bottom or ostomy  
• New or severe abdominal pain  
• Vomiting two or more times  
 
Severe symptom notification:  
“Your care team needs to know about your symptoms. Take a break from the 
survey and call them [link to clinic number ]. If it's after hours, ask to have your 
doctor paged .” 
 
Additionally, for less severe symptoms, patients are encouraged to call their care t eams if they 
are worried about their symptom or if it is worsening. If patients report pain that is in a 
moderate range of severity, or if they report that it is unacceptable to them, they are presented 
with the following message : 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, 2021  
 Page 23 of 55  
“Below, you’ll find some tips to help. Remember, your providers care about your 
pain. If this level of pain is not acceptable to you, or if you are worried about it, 
they want to hear from you. You can call them at [insert  clinic  number]. ” 
 
Finally, the patient -facing applica tion contains clear disclaimers on each survey that the 
portal is not continuously monitored, using the following language:  
“My Pain Pal is not constantly monitored. It is not monitored at all outside of 
regular business hours. For urgent problems, contact  [CONTACT_736801] 
(link to clinic number) or call 911. ” 
 
An additional risk for Cohort B is running out of data on their smartphone’s data plan; it is 
possible that using the study app could lead to extra charges from the smartphone carrier. For 
this reason, we recommend that participants are connected to Wifi while using the application.  
To mitigate this risk, eligibility criteria for this cohort outline that participants must have a 
smartphone data plan and access to Wifi.  
 
What data will be collected and how:  
• Symptom Reporting . Participant responses to the symptom reporting questions within 
STAMP will be collected for research purposes for Cohort A, and for both use in clinical 
care and for research purposes for Cohorts B. Cohort C data will only include 
hypothetical patient data related to clinical care.  
• Interview Data (Cohorts A and B) . Audio and video f eedback will be collected from all 
interview participants  regarding their understanding and acceptability of the mobile 
application.  
• Intervi ew Data (Cohort C).  Verbal f eedback will be collected from all interview 
participants  in Cohort C. Clinicians will be asked to evaluate whether patients’ needs are 
accurate, clear, and clinically appropriate when  presented in the portal . Additionally, 
participant  responses to usability and acceptability will also be collected.  
• E-Acceptability  (Survey)  Data : Participants in all Cohorts (A, B, and C) will complete an 
acceptability survey (see Appendices ZA, ZB, and ZC, respectively)  
• Demograp hics Survey : Clinicians in Cohort C will complete a non -identifiable 
demographics survey ( Appendix Y). 
• Chart Abstraction : Baseline demographic and clinical data will be collected from all 
patient participants (Cohorts A and B) via chart abstraction. Additi onally, for cohort B an 
end-of-study abstraction will evaluate any clinical interactions or management changes 
related to pain management that might have been influenced by [CONTACT_99023] (see 
Appendices XA and XB).  
App Usage Data:  Data on STAMP  app usage by [CONTACT_706377].  
 
Long -term follow -up: Not applicable for UAT.

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_790676]:  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_790677].  This will be a single arm study with  up to 20 patients . 
Patients with advanced so lid tumors who are using opi[INVESTIGATOR_790678] (GCC, palliative care), and they will be asked to 
use the app for 4 weeks. Once a patient is enrolled in the study, a research assistant (RA) 
will set up the app , putting in the patient’s prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_790679] . Patient  will 
have access to educational materials about pain management and patient educational 
videos about pain management and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]  (See Appendices P,  Q, and V, respectively , 
appro ved 01/13 /2020 - reference # 321742 ) through the app .  Patient will be prompted 
to take daily surveys for symptom reporting and medication updates. At the end of each 
survey  patients receive , a summary of their symptom severity, with links to tailored 
educational content about pain management, and recommendat ions about how to safely 
titrate over -the-counter laxatives to manage opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced constipation. This laxative 
advice operates within the parameters of normative and approved over -the-counter 
laxative use, and has been extensively reviewed, vetted, and a pproved by [CONTACT_7163] -
disciplinary groups of clinicians. If patients report any severe symptoms, they are 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_378450] , with a telephone number included on 
the application screen  (see Table 6) . If patients’ pain is poorly co ntrolled but not severe 
enough to be prompted to immediately contact [CONTACT_168198] (for example if their 
average pain is above a 4 and not acceptable),  they are reminded to contact [CONTACT_790707] . Finally, if they report any 
concerning abdominal symptoms ( e.g. no bowel movement in 4 or more days, haven’t 
passed gas from bottom or ostomy, new or severe abdominal pain, vomiting two or more 
times in the past 24 hours ), patients are not given any laxat ive titration instructions and 
are instead advised to contact [CONTACT_790708]. See Table [ADDRESS_1089954] their care team

interview will assess adherence to STAMP’s self -management recommendations, 
perceived usefulness of STAMP and its impact  on care team interactions  (see appendix 
AG for interview guide) .  
 
There will be a maximum of three attempts to contact [CONTACT_102]. During each attempt, 
the patient will be called, and if there is no response, a voicemail will be left [See 
Appendix AL for phone call and voicemail scripts]. Patients will be considered opt ed-out 
of the study if they do not respond to the maximum of 3 attempted contacts, or if they 
indicate that they would like to opt -out of the study during the call or their reply to the 
voicemail.  
 
 
Nurse navigators, physicians and mid -level providers  involved in  the care  of participating 
patients  will also be offered participation in the study . Once they agree to participate, 
clinicians  will be led  by [CONTACT_790711] 
[See Appendix AD ]. Clinicians will also complete a brief survey and semi -structured 
interview at end -of-study assessing satisfaction with STAMP and suggested 
enhancements  (see appendices AK and AJ respectively) .

Informed Consent:  Written consent will be obtained from all patient participants  (Appendix AH) . 
A waiver of informed consent is being requested for all clinician participants. Remote consenting 
will be permitted if a patient cannot be approached at an upcoming clinic visit. We will contact 
[CONTACT_790712]/zoom to request permiss ion to approach the patients. If 
their physician approves, we will  ask the m to introduce the study to the patient  at a regularly 
scheduled visit and ask permission of the patient for the research team to contact [CONTACT_790713] .  
 
When a treating clinician gives permission to approach their patient for participation, the study 
team will call the patient to explain the study and offer participation. We will also send the 
patient a study letter via mail or via email (depending on the patient's preference), but we will 
not wait for receipt of the letter to approach the patient. If the patient returns an opt out card, 
they will not be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
 
If a patient is being contact[CONTACT_3012] , the patient will be asked to confirm their identity and 
verify their personal information (i.e. date of birth, address). C onsent forms  will be sent  by [CONTACT_790714] a secure and personalized link in the FDA and HSSH compliant Mass 
General Brigham/Partners REDCap da tabase. During the consent discussion, the study staff will 
emphasize that participation is voluntary and the participant may stop participating at any time. 
Consent discussions may take place over the phone or HIPAA compliant Zoom.  
 
Methods that will be used to identify potential subjects:  
Under a HIPAA waiver, study staff will look in the electronic medical record and scheduling 
systems to identify potentially eligible patients who meet the eligibility criteria.  Study staff may 
also query Epic, administrative/operations/billing databases, order entry databases, and/or 
cancer registry databases to identify potentially eligible participants.  Study staff may also 
accept potential patient referrals from site clinicians . Clinicians will  be identified through direct 
referral from the study PI.

trajectory, medicatio n use, and quality of life. End of study survey will largel y replicate the 
baseline survey,  additionally,  patients will rate their satisfaction with STAMP using the 6 -item 
Acceptability E -scale.57 See Appendix AE for the Baseline survey items  and Appendix AI for end -
of-study survey items . Additionally, patients will  invited for a qualitative interview  to ask  a few 
open -ended questions about their experience to guide future refinements to the app  (see 
Appendix AG) .   
 
Intervention  
 
Cohort A: All patients on Cohort A will  use the STAMP mo bile phone App for 4 weeks. See below 
for a description of the interventi on.  
 
Intervention  (Cohort A ): After  the patient completes the baseline survey, the RA will 
meet with the patient (in person or virtually),  to assist in downloading the application  
onto participants’ mobile device , register the patient  to the a pp and help set up  any 
preferences . The RA will then conduct a 15 -minute tutorial on the STAMP app and its 
intended use  [Appendix AC]. The RA will also input the patient ’s pain medications and 
laxatives from  Epic, reconciling this list with the patient, and  with  the patient’s nurse 
navigator if there are any discrepancies . During the trial, t here is also a function in the 
app that allows participants to notify the research team if a medication needs to be 
changes and reflected in the app.  
Participants will utilize STAMP for 4-weeks . As reviewed in section 5.2 (Activity 2) , 
STAMP  hosts and org anizes patients’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_790685]. It has 
an extensive multi -media library of education content related to pain management 
(approved 01/13/2020 ( reference #321742) ). STAMP  prompts patients to take daily 
surveys for symptom reporti ng and medication updates. At the end of each survey 
patients receive, a  summary of their symptom severity, with links to tailored educational 
content about pain management, and recommendations about how to safely titrate over -
the-counter laxatives to mana ge opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced constipation. This laxative advice 
operates within the parameters of normative and approved over -the-counter laxative use, 
and has been extensively reviewed, vetted, and approved by [CONTACT_7163] -disciplinary groups of 
clinicians. If patients rep ort any severe symptoms, they are instructed to contact [CONTACT_790719] , with a telephone number included on the application screen , See table 
6. If patients’ pain is poorly controlled but not severe enough to be prompted to 
immediately contact  [CONTACT_168198] (for example if their average pain is above a 4 and 
not acceptable ), they are reminded to contact [CONTACT_790720] . Finally, if they report any concerning abdominal 
symptoms ( e.g. n o bowel movement in four days, have n’t passed gas from bottom or 
ostomy , new or severe abdominal pain  or vomiting two or more times ), patients are not 
given any laxative titration instructions and are instead advised to contact [CONTACT_790721].  
 
 Two protocol -mandated clinician outreaches  to patients will occur within a week of 
enrollment: 1) an RA will call to assess any technical or usability problems with the app, 
and 2) the nurse will review PRO’s in the STAMP portal and call patients to discuss 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, [ADDRESS_1089959] twice daily (Mon -
Fri), and contact [CONTACT_13935]’ nurse for any symptom that is flagged as “Red” in the 
portal . To assist in population management, a tiered system of color -coded flags  (Red, 
yellow and green) in the portal will  indicate symptom severity, need for outreach and/or 
management changes  (See Table 7 ). Of note, the system always prompts the patients to 
contact [CONTACT_790722].  These procedures have been approved by [CONTACT_790723] . Of note, nurses will also have access to this STAMP dashboard and be able 
to review patients’ primary symptom reporting data through a personal log -in and 
secure password.  
To minimize the burden of the intervention on clinicians, there are no automated 
clinician alerts (i.e. email  or in -basket message) for severe symptoms, rather, patients 
are prompted to call  their ca re teams  or 911 (emergency services)  if they report  severe 
symptoms . Patients are reminded frequently throughout the application that the 
clinician portal is not moni tored around the clock and therefore they should reach out 
for urgent needs . Symptom data are visible within the clinician portal. Reports , (with 
graphical symptom overviews, opi[INVESTIGATOR_378427], side effects ) will be sent to oncologists 
ahead of scheduled cli nic visits to enable effective communication, opi[INVESTIGATOR_736781], and 
other management changes.  
At the end of the 4 -week period, patients will be asked to complete an end of study 
survey [4-8 weeks] . Patients will also be invited to complete a short semi -structured 
interview about their experiences using the application ( See Appendix AG ). See below 
for description of the surveys.  
 
Clinici ans’ involvement in the study ( Cohorts B and C): Participating nurse navigators will also 
undergo a 30 -minute tutorial in which they get oriented to the clinician portal and how t o find 
the information about the pati ents  (appendix AD). The RA and study nurse will undergo more 
extensive trainings in use of the app and study procedures, led by [CONTACT_790724].  
The nurse navigators will be expected to reach out to their patients enrolled in the study within 
a week of enrolment after reviewing the PRO’s in the STAMP portal. During this call, they will 
discuss symptoms and self -management challenges. They may also  assist patient s with problem 
solving and offer medical advice.  After the initial check -in, the nurse navigators  will be asked to 
monitor the portal daily (Mon -Fri) and contact [CONTACT_790725].  The RA will also be 
monitoring the portal and reac hing out the Nurse Navigators as necessary.  Nurse navigators will 
be asked to fill out a usability survey at the end of their involvement. Physicians will receive 
reports from the app prior to seeing their patients who are enrolled in the study, and they b e 
asked for feedback after their patients completing the study. Clinicians will be asked to fill out a 
survey and will be invited for a 30 -minute interview at the end -of-study over the phone or via 
Zoom. The survey can be completed remotely though a link to a Partners Healthcare compliant 
electronic survey system (e.g. REDCap), over the phone with the RA, over Zoom with the RA; in 
person with pen and paper or on a tablet.

Chart Abstraction :  The study tea m will complete a limited structured chart abstraction  at 
baseline and at end -of-study  to collect basic non -identifiable clinical/demographic information  
(See appendix AF ). Chart abstraction will assess clinical actions responding to STAMP 
data, clinicians ’ adherence to STAMP CDS recommendations (methods previously 
described);16 and healthcare utilization (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ER visits, urgent clinic visits 
for symptom management.) Information collected will including the following :  
 
• Demographics : Gender, age, ethnicity, race  
• Cancer : Patient’s date of diagnosis, diagnosis (cancer type), stage at diagnosis, status of 
active curative or palliative treatment, and history and date of surgery related to cancer , 
patient seen palliative care (yes/no)  
• Pain : patient’s las t pain rating, type of pain, location of pain, surgeries or operations for 
pain, documented calls about pain.  
• Prescribed Pain Medicines : Patient’s prescribed short -acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], long -acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], 
and non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2454], and length of time taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
• Prescribed Laxative Medications : Patient’s prescribed laxative medications.  
• Medication side effects : Constipation or related s ymptoms.  
• Clinic visits : Unplanned or urgent clinic visits  [ADDRESS_1089960] -
intervention  
• Mental Health Diagnoses : Whether the patient has a mental health diagnosis and what 
mental health diagnosis the patient has.  
  
 
Monitor subjects for safety or minimize risks:  
Risks to Subjects  
• Physical  risks: Physical  risks to subjects include if they feel reassured by [CONTACT_9426]’s 
feedback/content and choose not to contact [CONTACT_378458] . It is 
also theoretically possible that patients are given laxative titration advice that is either 
ineffective at relieving constipation, or results in side effective such as diarrhea or 
abdominal pain.   
• Psychological risks: Reporting pain daily may be  distressing for some patients.  
• Privacy risks: There is a risk of privacy violation or loss of confidentiality; however, this is 
anticipated to be minimal, and the study team is committed to guaranteeing adequate 
protection against risk as described in the following section.   
 
 
Protection  Against  Risks  
 
Recruitme nt and Informed  Consent  
 
Participants will be sent a study letter and given the option to opt out of the study. If they 
do not opt out, p articipants will be approached  in by [CONTACT_215050] a private  and confid ential  
manner.  If the  patient  is eligible and interest ed in partic ipation,  the study letter and 
consent form  will be reviewed  with and signed by [CONTACT_2299].  The RA will keep  all 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, [ADDRESS_1089961] protected folder or locked cabinet , accessib le only  to the 
PI-designated  study  team  member.  
 
In the case of remote approach, Consent forms will be sent by [CONTACT_736795] 
a secure and personalized link in the FDA and HSSH compliant Mass General Brigham/Partners 
REDCap database. During the consent discussion, the study staff will emphasize that 
participation is vol untary and the participant may stop participating at any time . Consent 
discussions may take place over the phone or HIPAA compliant Zoom.  
 
The informed  consent  to participate  will adhere  to strict  standards  regarding  its 
content. Required  sections  include:  Introduction;  Why  is this  research  study  being  
done?  What  other  options  are there? What  is involved  in the research  study?  How 
long  will I be in this research  study?  What  are the risks  or discomforts  of the research  
study?  What  are the benefits  of the research  study?  Can I stop  being  in the resea rch 
study  and what  are my rights?  What  are the costs?  What  happens  if I am injured  or 
sick because I took  part in this research  study? What  about confidenti ality? Whom  do 
I contact  [CONTACT_39646] I have  questions  about  the research  study?  
  
Protection  against  the 3 types  of risk to this study:  
 
• Protection against physical risks: The study team has placed extensive protections 
against the aforementioned physical risks of the app. These protections significantly 
exceed the level of support and guidance that patients would receive with usual care. 
Moreover, patients’  symptom reports will be reviewed daily by [CONTACT_790726]/or 
nurse navigators, which represents closer monitoring than usual care. Finally, the 
patient -facing app always instructs patients to contact [CONTACT_790727].  
o First, the application sets a low b ar for instructing patients to contact [CONTACT_790728]. This includes reporting any new pain, fever, new 
or worsening back pain, new or worsening chest pain, any pain rated > 8 out of 
a 0 to 10 scale (S ee table 6 for the detailed lis t). Moreover, if patients report 
moderate to severe pain levels that do not meet the previous criteria, in 
addition to receiving education about their pain management, they are also 
reminded that their care team wants to hear from them if they are concerne d 
about their symptoms or if their symptoms are not improving. A link to their 
care team’s number is included in the application. This level of support is much 
greater than what patients have usually with routine care.  
o Regarding constipation advice, our team developed algorithms that replicate 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_790686]. These algorithms were generated from a 
rigorous development process guided by a multidisciplinary expert panel [ DFCI 
protocol #18-662].  Furthermore, the algorithms are built off o f titrating over -
the-counter laxatives within the parameters of acceptable doses on the package 
instructions. The app will also not provide any laxative advice if the patient 
reports severe abdominal symptoms including not passing gas in the last 48 
hours,  new or severe abdominal pain, no bowel movement in 4 or more days, 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, [ADDRESS_1089962] 24 hours.  
 
• Protection against psychological risks: if in the course of their participation patients raise 
significant emotional distress, the appropriate care team members i.e. nurse navigator, 
physician, mid -level provider will be contact[CONTACT_790729].  
 
Protection against privacy risks: To mo nitor the risk of loss of confidentiality/privacy, the 
study team has ensured that the STAMP app is HIPPA compliant and meet the privacy 
and security standards set by [CONTACT_102927]/HCC. In addition, all collected study data will be  
maintained in a secure location and personal identifiers will be removed.   
 
To maximize data security, both REDCap and STAMP employ:  
 
User Privileges - To ensure that users have access only to data and information that they are 
supposed to have within the  application, user privileges are utilized within the software. 
Each user has their own account, and their user account will only have access to information 
that they themselves have created or to which administrators have granted them access.  
  
Password -protection & Authentication - Both systems are password protected and 
implement authentication to validate the identity of end -users that log in to the system.  
Auto -logout setting will automatically log a user out of the system if they have not had any 
activity (e.g. typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], moving the mouse) on their current web page for the set amount of 
time. This prevents someone else from accessing their account and their data if they leave a 
workstation without properly logging out or closing their browser window.  
  
Logging and Audit Trail - Both systems maintain built -in audit trails that log all user activity 
and all pages viewed by [CONTACT_362877].  
 
What data will be collected and how:  
• Study -related health information (including, demographics, cancer type, cancer stage, 
treatment plan, recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], prescription drugs) will be collected via medical 
record (and/or local cancer registry) review  at baseline . 
• Health service utilization (e.g. ED visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], unplanned urgent clinic visits,  
changes to opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]) will be assessed by [CONTACT_790730].   
• Participant responses to the symptom reporting questions within STAMP will be 
collected for both use in clinical care and for research purposes.  
• Data on ST AMP usage by [CONTACT_706377].  
• Patient survey  at baseline and end of study  
• Semi -structured patient interviews at end of study (Zoom or phone)  
• Clinician survey at end of study

Brief description of activity: The study team will interview up to 30 patients (including 
DFCI inpatients and outpatients) about their experiences with a cancer diagnosis and 
chronic pain management. Interviews will be one -on-one, semi -structured, and 
cond ucted using the developed interview guide (see Appendix G). All interviews will be 
audio -recorded, transcribed, and coded for common themes. All patients for this activity 
will fall into one of two eligibility cohorts:  
Cohort A = patients visiting DFCI for a regular appointment with ongoing chronic 
cancer pain management issues  
OR 
Cohort B = patients visiting DFCI via the outpatient  care clinic or patients recently 
admitted to the DFCI inpatient clinic at BWH for an active pain crisis.  
 
Human Subjects Research Category (NHSR, exempt, expedited, full review): Full review     
 
Informed Consent: Written consent will be obtained from all  patient participants.  
 
Methods that will be used to identify potential subjects:  Under a HIPAA waiver, study staff will 
look in the electronic medical record, scheduling systems, and inpatient lists to identify 
potentially eligible patients who meet the  eligibility criteria.  Study staff may also query Epic, 
administrative/operations/billing databases, order entry databases, and/or cancer registry 
databases to identify potentially eligible participants.  Study staff may also accept potential 
patient refe rrals from site clinicians.  Purposive sampling based on data from the electronic 
medical record (e.g., demographics, cancer stage, number of recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], number of 
prescription drugs) will be used to ensure that perspectives of diverse patient s are included.

When, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited: Potentially eligibl e patients 
will be identified by 1) referrals from clinic staff, and 2) by [CONTACT_790732], and 3) by [CONTACT_790733]. Once the study team identifies a potentially eligible 
patient, the team will reach out to the treating clinician for permission to approach for 
an interview. Patients will sign informed consent according to IRB procedures. A $ 25 
incentive  will be provided after study completion.  
 
Materials that will be used to recruit subjects: NONE – if eligible, the study team will approach 
patients in -person to discuss.    
 
Duration of subject’s participation in the study: Patients will take part in a o ne-time, 1 -hour 
interview with the study team. All interviews will be in -person or over the phone.    
 
Duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects: We anticipate that the interviews will take 6 
months to complete. Analysis will follow, thereafter.  
 
Study design:  Semi -structured, qualitative interview  
 
Description of all research procedures being performed: After signing consent, all study 
patients will take part in a one -on-one interview with the study team. Prior to the 
interview, all patients will c omplete a one -time baseline survey (see Appendix I). The 
baseline survey involves demographic questions as well as validated pain measures. 
Patients can complete the survey via hard copy or online via REDCap. Once completing 
the baseline survey, patients w ill participate in the one -time interview. The interviewer 
will follow the developed interview guide (see appendix G). Interviews will take 
approximately one hour and can be conducted in -person or over the phone.  
 
As the study team member asks the interviewee questions from the interview guide, 
s/he will audio -record their responses and take notes. The audiotape and pa per onto 
which s/he records their responses will NOT contain an identifier of any kind (to 
elaborate, it will NOT contain the interviewee’s name, MRN, SSN; only a study ID 
number). After conducting each interview, we will store the interview responses (pap er 
and audiotape) in a locked drawer in our office (D‐1011). Once the data has been 
entered into an electronic medium, the electronic files will be kept on a secure, 
password‐protected server at Dana‐Farber Cancer Institute. The audio -recordings will be 
transcribed verbatim, using a secure system. All audio -recordings and study materials 
will be kept for 5 years following study completion, at which time they will be 
destroyed.  
 
Monitor subjects for safety or minimize risks: Not applicable.   
 
What data will  be collected and how: (see appendix H)  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, 2021  
 Page 38 of 55  
 
Basic demographic information (i.e. to explore gender or age stratification in qualitative 
results) will be collected from all participants via chart abstraction. Collected 
information will include:  
• Cancer : Patient’s date of diagnosis, diagnosis (cancer type) , stage at diagnosis, status of 
active curative or palliative treatment, and history and date of surgery related to cancer  
• Pain : Patient seen palliative care (yes/no), patient’s last pain rating, type of  pain, and 
location of pain.  
• Prescribed Pain Medicines : Patient’s prescribed short -acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], long -acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], 
and non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2454], and length of time taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
 
Statistical Analysis: Because interviews produce qualitative results,  statistical analyses 
will not be employed as part of this study. Q ualitative thematic analysis will use a 
grounded theoretical approach in which two or more investigators will code transcripts 
and assign labels using an open coding approach. Investigators  will name [CONTACT_790739]. Analyses will be conducted using NVIVO 
analytic software, which the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_790689].  
 
ENDPOINT:  The study team will use the qualitative results to h elp develop and modify  a 
new pain mobile health app for cancer patients.

7.0 Study -Wide Recruitment Methods*  
Each activity utilizes slightly different recruitment methods.  See section 5.0 for details.  
 
8.0 Multi -Site Research*  
Not applicable – this is NOT a multi -site research project.  
 
9.0 Study Timelines*  
The duration of an individual subject’s participation in the study and the duration 
anticipated to enroll all study subjects varies by [CONTACT_21398].  See section 5.[ADDRESS_1089964] will be dedicated to developi[INVESTIGATOR_790690]. We anticipate enrolling 4 -5 patients per week on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], and should 
thus complete the study within 3 -4 months.  The study timeline may change due to 
unforeseen circumstances.  
 
The estimated  date for the investigators to complete this study (complete primary 
analyses) is August 31, 202 1. 
 
10.0  Study Endpoints*  
 
Analysis of activity 1 (Focus groups and interviews):  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, 2021  
 Page 40 of 55  
Because interviews produce qualitative results, statistical analyses will not be employed as part 
of this study. The study  team w ill review qualitative feedback from both patients and clinicians  
across the four cohorts and  find common themes. The study tea m will use the common themes 
to guide development of the applicatio n. 
 
Analysis of activities 2 (application build) – Not applicable.  
 
Analysis of activity 3 (user acceptability testing):  
 
Patients that take part in UAT will complete a validated usability  survey57 and respond 
to open -ended questions about the app.58, 59 Verbal/non -verbal data will be transcribed 
and qualitatively analyzed to identify common themes related to usability problems and 
comprehension.  Detailed qualitative analysis is not appropriate for this aim. Rather, the 
goal is to identify and address any problems with the tools. After responsive rev isions, 
additional patients will participate in additional testing. UAT will occur until no new 
themes emerge, and the average usability score exceeds 4 (out of 5 on a 5 -point Likert 
scale).  
 
With identical methodology, providers that take part in UAT will “think aloud” using the 
clinician interfaces of STAMP, with iterative revisions and repeat testing as needed. The 
think -aloud method is the most common form of UAT for health technology, and has 
been shown to identify >70% of usability problems within th e first few interviews.  60, 61   
 
Analysis of activity 4 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124]): The primary outcomes for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_790691] .  
• Feasibility: Descriptive statistics will characterize  the proportion of eligible days on study 
that they complete a STAMP symptom sur vey, and the number of times patients log into 
the application. Other metrics of feasibility will include the study participation rate 
(proportion of eligible patients approached who consent to the study), completion rates 
of each study assessment, and the  proportion of patients who consent and enroll on 
study who complete the study.  
• Acceptability: summary statistics will characterize  acceptability ratings (e.g. mean and 
standard deviation), using  #7 from our modified acceptability scale  as our primary 
acceptability measure  (“how would you rate your overall satisfaction with My Pain Pal 
App?” , with response options ranging from 1 -5). Summary statistics will also assess 
acceptability on domains of ease of use, understandability, enjoyability, time required 
for use, learning, helpfulness, and likely to recommend to another patient.  
• Usability: summary statistics will characterize usability from the system usability scale  
• Exploratory outcomes: we will examine the number of symptom alerts generated by 
[CONTACT_790734], th e proportion of alerts that result in clinical action (e.g. phone calls or clinic 
visits), and medication changes.  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, 2021  
 Page 41 of 55  
Exploratory analyses will evaluate patient’s symptom trajectories using a marginal 
model with GEEs, and mixed -effects models with patient as  the random and time as the 
fixed effect.64 
 
Analysis of activity 5 (qualitative patient interviews): Because interviews produce qualitative 
results, statistical analyses will not be employed as part of this study. Q ualitative thematic 
analysis will use a grounded theoretical approach in which two or  more investigators will code 
transcripts and assign labels using an open coding approach. Investigators will name [CONTACT_790740]. Analyses will be conducted using NVIVO analytic 
software, which the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_790692].  
 
ENDPOINT: The study team will use the qualitative results to help develop a new pain mobile 
health app for cancer patients.   
 
11.0  Procedures Involved*  
The study design, study procedures and safety monitoring varie s by [CONTACT_21398].  See section 
5.0 for details.  
 
12.0  Data and Specimen Banking*  
This study does not involve any specimen collection/banking of any kind.  
Personal health information will be collected as part of this study.  
 
All data collected during this study will be stored and used for future research.   Any personal 
identifiers will be removed so that the information cannot be linked back to a patient.  
 
Investigators can request the data collected from this study for new r esearch.   Data may also be 
shared with outside non -profit academic investigators as well as with for -profit pharmaceutical 
investigators or commercial entities with whom Dana -Farber collaborates.  Requests must be 
sent to the study chair (Andrea Enzinger) and must be approved by [CONTACT_262968] -Farber IRB as well 
as the NIH prior to sharing.  
 
The consent form informs the participant that data collected for this study may be used in the 
future.  By [CONTACT_108930], participants agree.  Participants will not be asked to  provide additional 
informed consent for the use of de -identified information in future research.  
There is no scheduled date on which the information and data that is being used or 
shared for this research will be destroyed, because research is an ongoing  process.   
 
13.0  Data Management*  and Confidentiality  
 
DF/HCC uses a clinical trial management system (CTMS) called OnCore, which is managed by [CONTACT_790735] (ODQ).  
• Activity 1 involves focus groups  and interviews  and is considered exempt rese arch . 
We will NOT be collecting identifiable information from these participants. 
Therefore, we will not be using OnCore for participant registration.    
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, 2021  
 Page 42 of 55  
• Activity 2 is NHSR; registration in OnCore is not applicable.  
• Activity [ADDRESS_1089965] each participant’s initials and date of birth.  We will enter summary/batch 
accrual information into Dana -Farber’s CTMS OnCore for Activity 3. Individual 
registration is not feasible as OnCore mandates DOB.  
• Activity [ADDRESS_1089966] each participant’s initials and date of birth.  We will 
enter summary/batch accrual information into Dana -Farber’s CTMS OnCore for 
Activity 3. Individual registration is not feasible as OnCore mandates DOB.  
• Activity [ADDRESS_1089967] basic demographic information. Patient participants 
WILL be registered in OnCore.  
 
Data security: PHI data will be collected using multiple applications: REDCap and the 
STAMP app.  
 
REDCap:  For this study, data will be collected using the Partners instance of REDCap 
(redcap.partners.org).  In collaboration with the Harvard Catalyst | The Harvard Clinica l 
and Translational Science Center, REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free, 
secure, HIPAA compliant web -based application hosted by [CONTACT_790736], Enterprise Research Infrastructure & Services (ERIS).  Vanderbilt 
Unive rsity, with collaboration from a consortium of academic and non -profit 
institutional partners, develops this software application for electronic collection and 
management of research and clinical study data. Data collection is customized for each 
study or clinical trial by [CONTACT_790737].  REDCap is built around HIPAA guidelines and is 21 CFR Part 11 capable.   
 
STAMP App: The final application will be HIPPA compliant and compliant with DFCI 
security and priv acy standards  
 
To maximize data security, both REDCap and the STAMP App will employ:  
 
User Privileges.  To ensure that users have access only to data and information that they 
are supposed to have within the application, user privileges are utilized within the 
software. Each user has their own account, and their user account will only have access 
to information that they themselves have created or to which administrators have 
granted them access.  
 
Password -protection & Authentication.  Both systems are passwo rd protected and 
implement authentication to validate the identity of end -users that log in to the system.  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, [ADDRESS_1089968] not had 
any activity (e.g. typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], moving the mouse) on their curre nt web page for the set 
amount of time. This prevents someone else from accessing their account and their data 
if they leave a workstation without properly logging out or closing their browser 
window.  
 
Logging and Audit Trail.  Both systems maintain built -in audit trails that log all user 
activity and all pages viewed by [CONTACT_362877].  
 
Study specific procedure to maximize data security:  
 
Controlled access:  The REDCap and STAMP app administrator s will set up all user 
accounts so that each user only has access to their own relevant participant  data.  
 
Use of unique study ID numbers:  REDCap automatically assigns unique study ID 
numbers to each new case.   
 
Extensive training:  All personnel involved in  this study are required to complete and 
document completion of extensive protocol training.  Furthermore, all research 
personnel are required to have valid certification of human subjects research training.  
 
Quality control: The staff  at Dana -Farber will be responsible for monitoring the data for 
completion, accuracy, and compliance.  
 
14.0  Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects*  
 
This is a social behavioral research project, not a treatment protocol.  The study involves 
questionnaire -based assessments and symptom reporting and monitoring.  As such, the 
only adverse event that will be monitored and reported is psychological distress as 
determined by [CONTACT_258791]. For any  patient  who exhibits  severe  distress as 
result  of the  study  procedures,  the study  research assistant  will notify  the patients’  
oncologist  and social  worker for appropriate  response, including possible  mental  health  
referral  if necessary.  Further more, participants  will be reminded  that participation  is 
voluntary  and can be stopped  at any time for any  reason.  See the DSMP (appendix F) for 
more details.  
 
15.0  Withdrawal of Subjects*  
Subjects who do not  complete the baseline assessment within 1 week of study 
enrollment will be withdrawn from the research study without their consent.  These 
patients will be informed of their withdrawal from the study by [CONTACT_464].  
The overall DF/HCC study PI, [CONTACT_790741], will make all decisions regarding early 
termination of the study. The study team will then notify all participants accordingly.   
 
16.0  Risks to Subjects*  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP)  
Version 8, November 23, [ADDRESS_1089969] practices, rules, and regulations surrounding privacy and 
confidentiality, collecting research data using unique study ID numbers instead of names 
or other identifying information, and use of data collection systems t hat meet the NIH’s 
data security standards.  
 
17.0  Potential Benefits to Subjects*  
Using the STAMP app and taking part in this research study may or may not benefit participants.  
We hope that by [CONTACT_790738], patients are able to better manage their  symptoms and 
the increased flow of information between a patient and their care team improves their 
experiences.  We also hope the information learned from this research study will provide more 
information about  how to best help patients, caregivers, and their care team work together 
during and between visits to achieve better symptom management in cancer patients.  
 
18.0  Vulnerable Populations*  
This research does not involve vulnerable populations of prisoners, children, cognitively 
impaired adults, or pre gnant women. Prisoners, children, cognitively impaired adults, 
and pregnant women are excluded.

Roswell Park Protocol Number:  I [ADDRESS_901330] appeal among smokers. This study, part of a series (I [ZIP_CODE], I [ZIP_CODE]) will help 
determine whether a regulatory requirement to reduce ventilation will lower demand for cigarettes 
without unintended consequences This project will assess the effect of variation in pack messaging 
about filter ventilation on consumers’ rating of product appeal, perceptions of health risks, and 
changes in cigarette consumption in a 2-week field study. Our premise is that messaging about 
risks of filter ventilation will reduce the appeal of cigarette smoking and increase the likelihood 
that smokers would either quit smoking or switch to an alternative product (e.g., electronic 
cigarettes). This project is well-integrated with the other studies in this P01, using the same 
standardized research cigarettes with defined ventilation characteristics and design parameters, as 
well as relying on common biobehavioral measures.
The aim of the proposed study is to assess how adding messaging to cigarette packages about filter 
vents and filters influences respondents awareness of filter ventilation, beliefs about the function 
of filter vents and filters, smoking behavior, ratings of cigarette satisfaction, smoking topography, 
exposure to nicotine and carbon monoxide, perceptions about the risk of smoking, and intention 
to stop smoking.[ADDRESS_901331] appeal among smokers.  Ventilated cigarettes dilute smoke, which 
promotes perceptions of “smoothness” and therefore lower health risk, contributing to the overall 
appeal of these products. Tobacco product appeal is driven by [CONTACT_667498] (i.e. 
the potential for tobacco products to initiate and maintain nicotine dependence), subjective 
responses (e.g., liking, satisfaction, taste perceptions), and perceptions of cigarette pack messaging 
and other marketing strategies (including normative beliefs, risk perceptions, perceived benefits, 
outcome expectancies, use intentions, & product purchase). These perceptions and beliefs are 
further shaped by [CONTACT_667499]’ use of descriptive terms and colors on packaging 
designs and advertising.
In this project, we will assess whether messaging about ventilation from cigarette filters lowers 
cigarette product appeal among smokers. This project is significant because it will generate

2.2 Relevant Preliminary Data
The PI (O’Connor) and the investigative team have extensive experience in examining 
biobehavioral responses to cigarette design. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_667475] (Rees, 
unpublished) assessed responses to “light” cigarettes and packaging. Participants (N=90) were 
current smokers whose brand of choice was Marlboro “Lights”/Gold. Using a factorial design, 
participants were randomized to receive a Marlboro “Lights” cigarette presented in one of three 
pack conditions 1) text descriptors present; 2) text descriptor removed; and 3) plain (brown) pack. 
Participants smoked two cigarettes, in counterbalanced order: 1) blocked and 2) unblocked. A 
significant interaction was observed between pack design and ventilation on measures of smoking 
Effect (p=0.007), with the ventilated cigarette producing greater perceived effect as pack 
descriptors were removed, and Throat Impact (a cue for nicotine delivery) (p=0.039). Pack design 
and ventilation also interacted to influence sensory perceptions of irritation, and taste (p’s< 0.017), 
with higher ratings seen on plain packs with blocked ventilation.

Figure [ADDRESS_901333] and liking. Web-based survey work (conducted in August-September 2016) funded under 
the prior COMET project (under protocol I 218912) included items on awareness of filter 
ventilation among smokers,113 and an administration of the mCEQ.96 Among the 1986 current 
smokers in the sample, 44.7% were aware of filter vents in cigarettes, while 45.7% were unaware, 
and 9.7% replied ‘don’t know.’  Smokers aged 18-34 were more likely than those aged 35+ to be 
aware of vents (49.9% vs. 32.4%, <.001). Men were substantially more likely than women to be 
aware of vents (60.1% vs. 30.0%, p<.0001). Most smokers (among those aware; n=1079) believed 
that covering the vents would make the cigarette taste stronger (58.6%), though 15% reported 
‘don’t know.’ Those aged 18-34 were slightly more likely to believe covering vents would make 
cigarettes stronger (59.9% vs. 52.1%), though older smokers were more likely to say ‘don’t know’ 
(10.9% vs. 27.4%). All in all, these data suggest continued lack of awareness of filter ventilation 
among smokers.  Overall, 30.4% of smokers believed their cigarette was lighter in taste than other

compared to ‘regular’ cigarette smokers, while often being exposed to higher concentrations of 
tobacco toxicants that reach deeper parts of the lung 22,30-41 and likely contributing to a higher risk 
for lung adenocarcinomas.  Unfortunately, many smokers continue to believe that ‘low tar’ 
cigarettes are less hazardous to their health.18,19,42-[ADDRESS_901335]

Product appeal and risk perception. Two inter-related domains drive consumer trial and adoption 
of tobacco products 54-67, as illustrated in Figure 2. These include: i) perceptions of product 
APPROVED RPCI IRB

Roswell Park Protocol Number:  I [ADDRESS_901336] packaging; and ii) responses to product use, which 
include both sensory and other subjective response measures. Taken together, these consumer 
responses reflect the combined effects of product design and branding, and the subsequent 
outcome of product use behavior.
Sensory factors in smoking. There is substantial evidence that sensory effects of smoking, such as 
harshness, smoothness, and taste of smoke, are important drivers of continued use.  Initial work 
showed that sensory blockade reduced urge to smoke.87,[ADDRESS_901337],92,93,95 which would later be refined into a modified 
Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire.96 The release of internal tobacco industry research revealed 
the extent to which sensory factors were studied as important components of cigarette 
design.55,68,97,98 Continued misperceptions of cigarettes with misleading descriptors (e.g., “light”, 
“ultralight”, “mild”) are likely due to the sensory characteristics such as strength and harshness/ 
irritation 4,9 and filter ventilation level is related to perceptions of the relative harshness and 
strength of cigarettes.40,41 Expectancies of positive sensory effects of smoking (e.g., look, feel, and 
taste) are predictive of smoking behavior and willingness to try different cigarettes.99-[ADDRESS_901338].
Summary & Scientific Premise. Cigarette product design directly impacts product appeal via 
cognitive and sensory perceptions. Ventilated cigarettes dilute smoke, which is perceived as 
“smoother” and thus having lower health risks, contributing to the overall appeal of these products. 
These perceptions and beliefs are shaped by [CONTACT_667500]. The FDA, through the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco 
Control Act (FSPTCA),[ADDRESS_901339] relates to the agency’s ability to issue and enforce product standards. While there are 
substantial studies about the impact of filter ventilation on smokers’ perceptions, to date there are 
none about the impact of removing filter ventilation. Our premise is that messaging about filter 
ventilation will reduce the appeal of cigarette smoking and increase the likelihood that smokers 
would either quit smoking or move to alternative nicotine delivery systems (ANDS), e.g., e-
cigarettes or nicotine replacement therapy.

and receive a callback for scheduling pending eligibility.
Additionally, we plan to implement a chain referral method. This method has been successfully 
used in other participant-based studies. Here, all participants who complete the study will be given 
a “coupon book” containing 3 “coupons” (Appendix A), each with a unique code per participant. 
The participant may give a coupon to a friend/colleague/relative if they choose. The friend, in turn, 
may voluntarily call in to complete the screener, just as if they saw an ad. Should the friend 
successfully complete the study and return the coupon, the original participant may earn $10 per 
referral (up to a maximum of $30). A gift code (e.g., Amazon, Target) will be e-mailed upon the 
close of the entire study, guaranteeing the maximum amount of time to earn the largest monetary 
reward.  Finally, letters (Appendix A) will be mailed to the home address of participants who have 
previously completed a tobacco-related studies as the one of the three study sites (i.e., Roswell 
Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, and Harvard School 
of Public Health) and gave consent to be contact[CONTACT_667502].

Filters from these sessions will be used to examine within-cigarette compensatory smoking 
behaviors (e.g., vent blocking; mouth level exposure).114-116
11.2 Treatment
This study will use two types of cigarettes. On set of cigarettes are commercially available 
Marlboro cigarettes (Philip Morris [LOCATION_003], Richmond, VA), all combustible King size (83mm) 
cigarettes consisting of filler, filter paper, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_481529], cigarette paper, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_667477].  Specific varieties are listed in the table.  Products will be sourced at retail from local outlets.  
Alternatively, participants may receive investigational “roll your own” (RYO) cigarettes 
that will be prepared in the laboratory. These cigarettes will be made to match the 
commercially available Marlboro cigarettes. These cigarettes will be prepared with 
conventional tobacco (e.g., Good Stuff) rolled using an automatic rolling machine (e.g., 
Powermatic III+) and packaged into 20 rod packs. The investigational RYO cigarettes 
will use ventilated filter tubes (e.g., ~25-37% filter ventilation). The dose of nicotine in 
these RYO cigarettes will be similar to conventional cigarettes.
Within each pair of products is a nonmenthol and menthol equivalent.  Participants who report 
regularly smoking menthol cigarettes will receive the menthol versions for the study.

Additionally, cigarettes will be paired with messaging about filter ventilation. This message will 
be affixed to the front exterior of each package provided to participants. 
No Message (e.g., unaltered cigarette pack).
Neutral Message: “Nothing about this product’s color or name [CONTACT_667524] a

messages will determine if added messaging about the health risks of filter ventilation affect 
behavior/perceptions, and which type of message has the greater impact.
 11.3 Study Procedures
The proposed study is a between-subjects design in which participants will be randomized to 1 of 
4 conditions for 2 weeks. 
No Message (e.g., unaltered cigarette pack).
Neutral Message: “Nothing about this product’s color or name [CONTACT_667524] a

Data will be collected in three remote video sessions and via EMA conducted over 2 weeks. Each 
study session is expected to take 0.5 hours. For each condition, active data collection is expected 
to take no more than 15 minutes. Study materials (cigarettes, CO monitor, containers for cigarette

attitudes, and beliefs about filter vents. In addition, participants complete questionnaires on 
message perceptions (response to messaging, health risk, purchase intention) for all pack 
messages. Questionnaires also will be used to get baseline assessments of the user’s usual brand 
of cigarettes (Duke Sensory Scale, Product Evaluation Scale, Hedonic Attribute Scale). 
Participants will be instructed to record each smoking event using the EMA app provided

Remote Data Collection. Participants will complete the two-week study remotely using EMA 
methods. At the conclusion of Session 1, participants will be trained to record their assigned 
product use via EMA for data collection. Specifically, participants will respond to [ADDRESS_901354] consumption, context of 
use (e.g., location, social situation), and subjective responses (e.g., withdrawal, product evaluation, 
message attention - more details on surveys provided below). Participants will be prompted to 
measure their exhaled-air CO level and product weight twice each day using a personal monitor 
provided to them. Participants will also retain all spent cigarette butts and unused products 
throughout the two weeks.
Day 3 Check-in: Research assistants will monitor EMA data to ensure the participant is compliant 
with study procedures. Participants will send a secure text message (via Twilio) or arrange a phone 
call to discuss the participant’s compliance in the initial days of data collection. Participants that 
are not responding to prompts will be retrained to ensure they understand procedures and warned 
that compliance must increase to continue participating in the study.

attempts) 
Delay discounting
A series of previously used items will assess knowledge and perceptions of filter 
vents.113,117 
Nicotine dependence will be assessed using: 
oFagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND118) 
oPROMIS
Behavioral aspects of cigarette dependence will be assessed using:
The Glover-Nilsson scale 120,121 
The different scales are used to capture different dimensions of tobacco dependence.122 
Exhaled air CO will be collected by [CONTACT_667505] a personal CO 
monitor provided by [CONTACT_41314]. The CO monitors provided are coVita iCo™ 
Smokerlyzers®, which are intended for research and consumer use and are compatible with 
a Smartphone or tablet (iOS or Android).
Perceptions of product messaging: In this study, we are interested in risk perceptions, smoking-
related expectancies, and behavioral intentions. We will assess risk perceptions for specific 
products using a risk ladder.129 More generalized perceptions of risk for cancer are captured using 
the tripartite risk (TRIRISK) measure, which captures deliberative, affective, and experiential 
components of risk perception.130 The adult smoking consequences questionnaire (SCQ) will 
assess smoking-related expectancies.103,131 Behavioral intention is assessed using Juster’s 
consumer purchase probability scale, a widely used marketing metric.132-134 Additional questions 
will include responses to messaging (e.g., message was powerful, memorable).
Responses to product use will be assed in a number of ways:  Response to nicotine dose will be 
assessed using the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (symptoms of nicotine withdrawal).[ADDRESS_901359] Evaluation Scale and Drug 
Effects/Liking Scale.
Cigarette tracking via EMA: For the field study, the key outcome is the total number of cigarettes 
smoked. Participants will be asked to complete REDCap questionnaires on their personal phone 
(iOS or Android). Participants can use the MyCap application to respond to questionnaires. 
Additionally, REDCap can interface with Twilio, a secure text-messaging platform, to send study 
related messages and surveys via SMS (text messaging). Proposed EMA methods are based on 
established best practices. Participants will complete 5 questionnaires every day. These 
questionnaires will occur at the same time each day: 11am, 1:30pm, 4pm, 6:30pm, and 9pm. These 
daily reports will be used to assess cigarette and e-cigarette consumption, and 10 items relating to 
subjective ratings of nicotine withdrawal (e.g., craving, irritability) and mood (e.g., calm/relax, 
happy). At 11am only, participants will complete selected items from the Hedonic Attribute Profile 
and Product Evaluation Scale. At 9pm only, participants will be asked to rate the taste, satisfaction,

asked to take a CO measurement at this time. At the 1:30 and 6:30 prompts, participants will be 
asked about situational factors related to use (Location, smoking permitted, with others, activity, 
craving) and complete the Duke Sensory Evaluation scale. Participants also will be asked to take 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_667481]. Surveys will be open for 1 hour 
after the scheduled time for completion. Appendix C demonstrates the EMA schedule and the 
questions asked at each daily report and pseudo-random prompt. Participants can earn up to $10 
for each day of EMA compliance, with compliance being defined as responding to > 4 of 5 daily 
prompts (up to 14 days, totaling $140). Studies that used similar methods had >90% compliance. 
[189, 190].
12 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS
12.1 Anticipated Circumstances Under Which Subjects Will be Withdrawn From the 
Research Without Their Consent
Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they do not follow the study schedule or 
requirements. Participants are expected to reach 80% EMA compliance daily (>4 of 5 prompts). 
If a participant fails to reach 80% compliance for 3 consecutive days, that participant will be 
warned and retrained. If the participant continues to be noncompliant for 3 additional days, they 
will be withdrawn from the study. Failure to respond to any study prompts (0% compliance) for 
three consecutive days will result in withdrawal.
12.2 Procedures That Will be Followed When Subjects Withdraw From the Research, 
Including Partial Withdrawal From Procedures With Continued Data Collection
The participants will only be paid for the completed study sessions and then will be dismissed 
from the study. 
13 RISKS TO SUBJECTS
13.1 Foreseeable Risks
Answering questionnaires pose none to minimal risk. In the event a question causes any type of 
distress, information will be provided to identify psychological resources available to the

Cigarette smoking.
Since we are using commercially available cigarettes, the side effects of the cigarettes used in this 
study would be similar to the use of other commercial cigarette products, including those the 
participants smoke themselves. Participants could experience an increased risk for mouth sores, 
gum disease and tooth loss, nausea or stomach aches, vomiting, or high blood pressure. Some 
people who use cigarettes may experience irritation of the mucosal membranes of the upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352] (i.e., the membranes that line the mouth and throat), but as the participants in this 
study are already regular users, we do not think that this is likely to occur.

22 STATISTICAL PLAN
22.1 Data Analysis Plan
The analysis of EMA data will be analyzed using a linear mixed model with fixed effects for vent 
message (product design, color/name), as well as sex and other tobacco product strata (cigarettes 
only or dual use). The effect of packaging will be tested using a Bonferroni-corrected type-I error 
rate of 0.008 (0.05/6) to account for all possible pairwise comparisons of packaging types. Data 
from the field-study (e.g., change in product responses, risk, TNE, aldehyde-DNA adducts) will 
be analyzed using linear regression with terms in the model for vent message (no message, neutral, 
compensation, blocking), sex, and other tobacco product use.. Categorical outcomes for the field-
study will be analyzed using logistic regression.  As exploratory approaches, we will use time-
varying effects models (TVEMs) to explore the effect of message condition on smoking behavior 
(product compliance), craving, risk perception, and quit intention in the EMA data.[191, 192] 
TVEMs have been used previously to examine treatment effects on craving [193] and relapse.[194] 
TVEMs will provide daily effect sizes, thereby [CONTACT_667511] 
(and relationships with other predictors) change over time (i.e., early vs. later in product 
switching). Responses at Visit 1  can be treated as time invariant predictors and mCEQ from EMA 
can be treated as time-varying predictor (and/or outcome) of product use.

Dear [insert name],
We are contact[CONTACT_667518], and asked to be 
contact[CONTACT_667519].   
We are looking for regular cigarette smokers to participate in an important research project. The 
purpose of the study is to examine the impact of messaging about filter ventilation, a common 
design feature of cigarettes.  
To do this, we are asking people to participate in a study involving two weeks of remote data 
collection and three videoconferencing sessions in which you will be asked to use specific 
cigarettes. During the first videoconference session, we would ask you to answer questionnaires 
on your smoking behavior and train you on remote data collection procedures. During remote 
data collection, we will ask you to respond to [ADDRESS_901395] use, situational 
factors (location, social situation) and how you’re feeling. We hope findings from this study can 
inform the regulation of cigarette products by [CONTACT_667520].
This research has received ethics clearance from the Roswell Park Institutional Review Board 
and all the information you provide will be kept strictly confidential.  Only the investigators 
directly associated with the study will have access to this information. This study is funded by 
[CONTACT_29630], National Institutes of Health, and the investigators have no 
affiliations with any tobacco or pharmaceutical company.   
If you are interested, please contact [CONTACT_667521]], and ask for the VENT Study.  
You may also email  [insert  site email] with a good time to call you.  
Sincerely,

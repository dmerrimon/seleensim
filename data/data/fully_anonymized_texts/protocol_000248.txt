Active-controlled Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of 
Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_788412] 
(13-17 years old) With Schizophrenia
Clinical Phase/Trial 
Type:3/Therapeutic confirmatory
Treatment Indication: Schizophrenia
Objective(s): To evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_788413]: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and 
active-controlled trial designed to assess the effect of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_788414], ages 
13 to 17 years, with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders - Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of 
schizophrenia.  The initial diagnosis of schizophrenia should 
be made by [CONTACT_276168] (psychiatrist or 
local medical equivalent who is experienced in treating 
adolescents with schizophrenia).  The diagnosis should then be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_788477]-Present and Lifetime version 
(K-SADS-PL), performed by [CONTACT_788478].  The trial is planned to be conducted on an 
outpatient basis.
This trial has a 6-week double-blind treatment period.
After a minimum 3-day washout period, subjects who continue 
to meet all entrance criteria (including Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale [PANSS] Total Score ≥ 80) at the baseline 
visit (Day 1) will be randomized 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 double-blind 
treatment arms:

Confidential - Proprietary Information 4 Version 5.0, 05 Jul 2022 Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_788415] a minimum dose of 2 mg in 
8 days and aripi[INVESTIGATOR_788415] a minimum dose of 
10 mg, the therapeutic dose as per the [LOCATION_002] (US) 
package insert.  Subjects who are unable to tolerate the 
minimum dose will be discontinued.  At the end of the titration 
period, investigators will be able to adjust the dose of 
double-blind investigational medicinal product (IMP) not to 
exceed brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 4 mg/day or aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] [ADDRESS_1085591] dose 
increase, if the dose adjustment is not well tolerated, the dose 
may be reduced back to the minimum dose allowed by 
[CONTACT_990] (ie, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 mg and aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 10 mg).  
Subjects not able to tolerate the decreased dose will be 
discontinued from the trial.
Mandatory evaluations will take place at Day 1 (baseline), 
Day 4 (telephone call), and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
However, at the discretion of the treating physician, more 
frequent evaluations are permitted.
Eligible subjects who complete the 6-week double-blind 
efficacy phase may have the option to enroll into an open-label 
safety trial of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (Protocol 331-10-236).
All subjects who do not enroll in the open-label rollover trial 
(Protocol 331-10-236) will be assessed by a telephone 
assessment 21 (± 2) days after the last dose of IMP to assess 
adverse events (AEs).
Subject Population: The trial population will include male and female subjects 
between 13 and 17 years of age, inclusive, at the time of 
informed consent/assent and at baseline (Day 1) who continue 
to have a confirmed DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia and a 
PANSS Total Score ≥ 80 at screening and at baseline (Day 1).  
Approximately 645 subjects are anticipated to be screened 
with the expectation that 315 subjects will be randomized.
Inclusion/Exclusion 
Criteria: Subjects must meet the inclusion criteria at both screening and 
baseline.  Key inclusion criteria include the following:
•Subjects ages 13-17 inclusive at time of consent/assent and 
at baseline (Day 1) with a current primary diagnosis of 
schizophrenia, as defined by [CONTACT_2681]-[ADDRESS_1085592], and a history of the illness (diagnosis 
or symptoms) for at least 6 months prior to screening.Clinical Study Report 331-10-234 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] [ADDRESS_1085594] deviation (SD) at Week 6 was 19.

placebo.  With the assumption of missing at random (MAR), a 
mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with fixed 
effect factors of treatment, trial site, visit, treatment visit 
interaction, and fixed effect covariates baseline and baseline 
visit interaction will be applied to the change from baseline 
from Week 1 to Week 6 based on all available data (observed 
case dataset).  The data will be modeled using an unstructured 
variance covariance matrix for the within subject variation.  A Clinical Study Report 331-10-[ADDRESS_1085598] squares (LS) mean differences at 
Week 6 of the MMRM analysis will serve as the analysis of 
the primary endpoint.
In case there is a convergence problem with the MMRM 
model with the unstructured variance covariance matrix, the 
following structures other than unstructured will be used in 
order of 1) heterogeneous toeplitz, 2) heterogeneous 
autoregressive of order 1, and 3) heterogeneous compound 
symmetry, and the first (co)variance structure converging to 
the best fit will be used as the primary analysis.  If a structured 
covariance has to be used, the “sandwich” estimator of the 
standard error of the fixed effects parameters will be used in 
order to deal with possible model misspecification of the 
covariance matrix.  
In order to explore the robustness of the primary analysis 
based on the MAR assumption, sensitivity analysis of the 
primary efficacy endpoint under a “missing not at random” 
assumption will be conducted, using a pattern-mixture model.
Trial Duration: Individual participation for subjects who complete the trial 
without early withdrawal will be approximately 13 weeks, 
consisting of a screening period of up to 28 days, a 6-week 
double-blind treatment period, and a 21 (± 2)-day follow-up, if 
applicable.  Subjects may have the option to enter an 
open-label rollover trial after completion of treatment.  Only 
subjects who do not participate in the open-label trial will be 
followed up via telephone contact 21 (± 2) days after the last 
dose of IMP.  Clinical Study Report 331-10-[ADDRESS_1085599] of Abbreviations and Definitions of Terms

In that trial, overall systemic exposure was measured by [CONTACT_2715]-normalized maximum 
concentration at steady state (C max,ss ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
to the last observable concentration (AUC τ), and was slightly higher (geometric mean 
ratio [GMR] adult/adolescent:  0.765 and0.904, respectively), and apparent clearance of 
drug from plasma after extravascular administration (CL/F) was slightly lower (GMR 
adult/adolescent:  1.11) in adolescents compared to adults in the more important PK 
evaluable population.  For the less important PK population, slightly lower 
dose-normalized area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours 
(AUC 0-24h) (GMR adult/adolescent:  1.05), and slightly higher dose-normalized C max 
(GMR adult/adolescent:  0.904) were observed in adolescents when compared to adults.  
The difference in the results for the two populations may be due to potential

Protocol 331-10-234
Confidential - Proprietary Information 30 Version 5.0, 05 Jul 2022 Trial 331-10-233 were assigned to a dosing cohort and entered a Dose Titration Phase 
during which they received a starting dose of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (0.5 mg or 1 mg) for 2 to 
10 days based on their assigned titration schedule.  Following the Dose Titration Phase, 
subjects entered the Fixed Dose Phase and were administered the assigned dose (0.5 mg 
to 4 mg) for that cohort for 14 days. For the final Cohort a Dose Titration of 1 mg on 
Days 1 and 2; 2 mg on Days 3 and 4; 2.5 mg on Days 5 and 6; 3 mg on Days 7 and 8; and 
3.5 mg on Days 9 and 10, followed by 4 mg daily for 14 days was followed.  
Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_123150] 0.5 mg/day, 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day, and 4 mg/day was 
generally safe and well tolerated in adolescent subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorder, or other related psychiatric disorders.  Overall, systemic exposure and apparent 
clearance did not appear to be significantly different between adolescent and adult 
subjects while high variability due to limited number of evaluable subjects contributed to 
small differences between the PK evaluable and PK populations.
Based on results of pi[INVESTIGATOR_788446], a dose 
range of 2 to 4 mg is shown to be efficacious (Rexulti Label).  Based on the safety and 
PK data in Trial 331-10-233, no dose adjustment is deemed necessary in children and 
adolescents and thus a similar efficacious dose range of 2 to 4 mg is proposed for this 
trial.  In adult patients, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_788447] 1 mg for 3 days followed by 2 mg for 
3 days, and a similar dose initiation is proposed in adolescent patients as a similar dose 
initiation scheme was evaluated in the final cohort of Trial 331-10-233 with no safety or 
tolerability concerns.  
2.3 Trial Objectives
The objective of the trial is to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_788448].

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Interruption
All attempts should be made to avoid treatment interruption during the trial.  For subjects 
who have an interruption of treatment, the investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_788492].  The sponsor should be notified when 
there is a planned or inadvertent treatment interruption of [ADDRESS_1085625]’s continuation in the trial.  This decision will be documented by [CONTACT_788493].  The treatment interruption 
will be recorded via eSource and also recorded as a protocol deviation (Section 3.13).
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Discontinuation
After randomization, a subject may stop treatment permanently for a variety of reasons.  
Treatment discontinuations may be initiated by a subject who is not satisfied with 
treatment or may become medically necessary due to AEs, required treatment with a 
disallowed medication or therapy, or other issues, as determined by [CONTACT_093].  
However, each investigator must comprehensively review the circumstances and offer the 
subject options for continued treatment to the degree possible as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
If a subject discontinues from the trial prematurely, the reason must be fully evaluated 
and recorded appropriately in source documents and in eSource.  If the subject is being 
withdrawn because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason for withdrawal.  
All subjects have the right to withdraw at any point during treatment without prejudice.  
The investigator can discontinue a subject’s participation in the trial at any time if 
medically necessary.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Documenting Reasons for Treatment Discontinuation
Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must discontinue IMP and be withdrawn 
from the trial:
a) occurrence of any AE, intercurrent illness or abnormality in a laboratory assessment 
which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], warrants the subject’s permanent withdrawal 
from the trial;
b) treatment with a prohibited concomitant medication other than the use of appropriate 
medications for the treatment of AEs under direction of the investigator;
c) subject noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the trial schedule 
or procedures (see Section 3.12);Clinical Study Report 331-10-234 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

e) subject becomes pregnant (see Section 5.5);
f) subject cannot tolerate the assigned dose of IMP;
g) subject is lost to follow-up;
h) death;
i) subject withdraws informed consent; or
j) termination of all or part of the trial by [CONTACT_456].
The investigator will notify the sponsor promptly when a subject is withdrawn.  Subjects 
withdrawn prior to Week [ADDRESS_1085626] complete the Week 6 evaluations at the time of 
withdrawal.  In addition, all subjects who withdraw prematurely from the trial will be 
assessed by a telephone assessment 21 (± 2) days after the last dose of IMP for evaluation 
of safety.  Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal of Consent
All subjects have the right to withdraw their consent from further participation in the trial 
at any time without prejudice.  Subjects’ parents or legal guardians can also withdraw 
their consent to allow subjects to continue participation in the trial.  Subjects cannot 
withdraw consent for use of data already collected as part of the trial, but only for future 
participation.  The investigator can also discontinue a subject’s participation in the trial at 
any time if medically necessary.  Unless the subject provides their written withdrawal of 
consent or there is other written documentation by [CONTACT_788494]’s verbal intent to completely withdraw from the trial, subjects should be followed 
for all protocol-specified evaluations and assessments, if possible.
Complete withdrawal of consent requires a subject’s refusal of ALL of the following 
methods of follow up:
•Participation in all follow-up procedures specified in the protocol (whether in-clinic, 
by [CONTACT_756], or by [CONTACT_28920]-home visit).
•Participation in a subset of protocol specified follow-up procedures (by a frequency 
schedule and method, as agreed by [CONTACT_330210]).
•Contact [CONTACT_330211], even if only by [CONTACT_756], to assess current 
medical condition, and obtain necessary medical or laboratory reports relevant to the 
trial’s objectives.
•Contact [CONTACT_308705](s) who have been designated in source records as being 
available to discuss the subject’s medical condition, even if only by [CONTACT_756], mail, 
or e-mail (eg, family, spouse, partner, legal representative, friend, neighbor, or 
physician).Clinical Study Report 331-10-234 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-10-234
Confidential - Proprietary Information 64 Version 5.0, 05 Jul 2022•Access to medical information from alternative sources (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic medical 
records, referring doctor’s notes, public records, dialysis, transplantation or vital 
registries, social media sources). 
Withdrawal of consent is a critical trial event and therefore should be approached with 
the same degree of importance and care as is used in initially obtaining informed consent.  
The reasons for a subject’s intended withdrawal need to be completely understood, 
documented, and managed to protect the rights of the subject and the integrity of the trial.  
A subject may initially express their desire to interrupt or discontinue IMP 
administration, which is not equivalent to a complete withdrawal of consent for further 
participation (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  A subject ma y, however, indicate 
that further trial participation is creating a burden on their work or social schedule.  
Therefore, the investigator should follow the procedures outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] to 
determine if the subject can continue participation in the trial if modifications to his/her 
treatment or schedule of assessments can be accommodated.  Only subjects who 
withdraw their permission for all of the above degrees of follow up are considered to 
have completely withdrawn their consent to participate in the trial.
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures to Encourage Continued Trial Participation
In all cases of impending IMP discontinuation or consent withdrawal, investigators will 
be given instructions to meet and discuss with the subject their options of continuing in 
the trial, preferably on therapy.  The investigator should ensure understanding and 
documentation of the reasons for the subject’s desire to withdraw consent.  
3.[ADDRESS_1085627] is one from whom informed consent is obtained and is 
documented in writing (ie, subject signs an ICF), but who is not started on treatment, 
whether through randomization or open assignment.  For the purposes of this trial, 
treatment begins with the first dose of double-blind IMP at the baseline visit.  If a subject 
fails to qualify for the trial during screening for a reason other than a positive screen for 
drugs of abuse, he/she is permitted to be rescreened at a later date.  In the event that a 
screen failure is rescreened for trial participation after the 28-day screening period 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054], a new ICF must be signed and a new screening number assigned.
3.[ADDRESS_1085628]-treatment follow-up contacts will not qualify as the “last scheduled visit.”  
Subjects who are not completers are defined as those who “discontinued the trial.”
3.[ADDRESS_1085629] a known reason for discontinuation (eg, withdrew consent or 
AE), and for whom a survival status at the end of the trial cannot be determined will be 
classified as “lost to follow-up” as the reason for discontinuation.  Survival status can be 
determined from a variety of sources, either by [CONTACT_788495] (ie, death certificate, medical records, public records, statement by a family 
member or primary care physician) or acceptable documentation for life (ie, direct 
contact [CONTACT_1155], medical records, successful telephone contact [CONTACT_1155], 
statement by a family member or primary care physician, or public records).
The site will make [ADDRESS_1085630] via certified mail or an alternative similar method, where appropriate, before 
assigning a “lost to follow-up” status.
3.[ADDRESS_1085631] Compliance 
Responsible trial personnel will dispense the IMP (ie, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], and 
placebo) to subjects.  Accountability and compliance verification should be documented 
in the subject’s trial records.  Subjects must be counseled on the importance of taking the 
IMP as directed at all trial visits.  If poor compliance continues after counseling (eg, 
multiple missed doses resulting in less than 80% overall compliance), discontinuation of 
the subject from the trial should be considered.
3.13 Protocol Deviations
This trial is intended to be conducted as described in this protocol.  In the event of a 
significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or mistake (eg, 
violation of informed consent process, IMP dispensing or subject dosing error, treatment 
assignment error, subject enrolled in violation of eligibility criteria or concomitant 
medication criteria), the investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_788496].  The investigator and sponsor will come as quickly as Clinical Study Report 331-10-[ADDRESS_1085632]’s best medical interests should guide the investigator in the management of 
conditions that are pre-existing or that develop during the trial (intercurrent illness or 
AEs).  The investigator should examine the acceptability of all concomitant medications 
not explicitly prohibited.  In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is 
administered, it is essential that subjects be instructed not to take any medications (either 
self-administered non-prescription drugs or prescription therapy prescribed by [CONTACT_3213]) without prior consultation with the investigator.  All trial personnel should be 
familiar with the content of the IB for brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_788454]’s 
condition adequately and select appropriate concomitant medications, if needed.
4.2.2 Non-therapy Precautions and Restrictions
[IP_ADDRESS] Precautions
Subjects should not undergo any elective medical procedure without prior consultation 
with the investigator.  An elective procedure (eg. minor surgery, dental surgery, 
orthopedic surgery) that might require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_788455].
[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions
With the exception of inpatient group therapy, new-onset psychotherapy is prohibited 
during the trial.  In other words, except for inpatient group therapy, subjects may only 
receive psychotherapy (eg, individual, group, marriage, or family therapy) if they have 
been participating in the therapy regularly (ie, weekly) for at least 6 weeks (42 days) prior 
to screening and commit to maintain their participation during the course of the trial at 
the current frequency or unless permission is obtained from the medical monitor.
Consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges, or Seville orange 
products within [ADDRESS_1085633] and unintended 
response to an IMP related to any dose administered.
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
IMP caused the AE.  For the purpose of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE.  
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality.
An SAE includes any event that results in any of the following outcomes:
•Death
•Life-threatening; ie, the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred.  It does not include an event that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
•Persistent or significant incapacity/disability or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions.
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908].
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_444437]; whenever possible the 
reason for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_92657].
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_92658] (ie, those 
required for reasons of convenience or other non-medical need) are not 
considered SAEs.
•Congenital anomaly/birth defect.
•Other medically significant events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above; eg, allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
Nonserious adverse events are all AEs that do not meet the criteria for an SAE.Clinical Study Report 331-10-[ADDRESS_1085634] be indicated on the AE screen 
in eSource.  Examples of AEs that are considered EPS include, but are not limited to:  
generalized rigidity, hyperkinesia, bradykinesia, akinesia, dystonia, hypertonia, akathisia, 
tremor, flexed posture, involuntary muscle contractions, athetosis, and chorea.  If a 
subject is experiencing [ADDRESS_1085635] be 
entered as “extrapyramidal syndrome” on the AE screen in eSource instead of the 
individual symptoms.  Permitted treatments for EPS are described in Section 4.2.1.
Immediately Reportable Event (IRE):
•Any SAE.
•Any AE related to occupational exposure.
•Potential serious hepatotoxicity cases (any increase of AST or ALT ≥ 3 times the 
upper normal limit or screening value with an increase in total bilirubin ≥ 2 times 
the upper normal limit or screening value) 
•Pregnancies are also defined as IREs.  Although normal pregnancy is not an AE, 
it will mandate IMP discontinuation and must be reported on an IRE form to the 
sponsor.  Pregnancy will only be documented on the AE screen in eSource if there 
is an abnormality or complication.
Clinical Laboratory Test Value Changes:  It is the investigator’s responsibility to review 
the results of all laboratory tests as they become available.  This review will be 
documented by [CONTACT_093]’s dated signature [CONTACT_444495].  For each 
abnormal laboratory test result, the investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal 
(ie, clinically significant) change from baseline for that individual subject.  This 
determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnormal 
value is observed.  The investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional 
tests to verify the results of the original laboratory tests.  If this laboratory value is 
considered medically relevant by [CONTACT_093] (subject is symptomatic, requiring 
corrective treatment or further evaluation), or if the laboratory value leads to 
discontinuation, or fulfills a seriousness criterion, this is considered an AE. 
Severity:  Adverse events will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported as indicated in 
eSource.  The intensity of an adverse experience is defined as follows:
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.
2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity.
3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.Clinical Study Report 331-10-234 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-10-234
Confidential - Proprietary Information 74 Version 5.0, 05 Jul 2022IMP Causality:  Assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the use of the IMP is 
defined as follows:
Related: There is a reasonable possibility of a temporal and causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Not Related: There is no temporal or causal relationship between the IMP and 
the AE.
5.2 Eliciting and Reporting Adverse Events
The investigator will periodically assess subjects for the occurrence of AEs.  To avoid 
bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the non-leading question:  “How have you 
felt since your last visit?”  All AEs (serious and nonserious) reported by [CONTACT_788497].  The AE 
collection is to begin after a subject has signed the ICF.  
Use medical terminology in AE reporting.  Adverse events should be reported as a single 
unifying diagnosis whenever possible or, in the absence of a unifying diagnosis, as 
individual signs or symptoms.  Exacerbation or disease progression should be reported as 
an AE only if there are unusual or severe clinical features that were not present, or 
experienced earlier, or not expected based on the course of the condition.  A reported AE 
that undergoes a change in severity, seriousness, or toxicity should be reported as a new 
AE in eSource.
Note:  Normal pregnancy is not an AE and should not be recorded as one in eSource; 
guidelines outlined in Section 5.[ADDRESS_1085636] be completed and sent by e-mail, fax, or overnight courier 
to the sponsor.  (Please note that the IRE form is NOT the AE screen in eSource.) 
Subjects experiencing SAEs should be followed clinically until their health has returned 
to baseline status, or until all parameters have returned to normal or have otherwise been 
explained.  It is expected that the investigator will provide or arrange appropriate Clinical Study Report 331-10-[ADDRESS_1085637]’s status to 
the sponsor.
5.[ADDRESS_1085638] or ALT that is ≥ [ADDRESS_1085639], a 
total bilirubin level should also be evaluated.  If the total bilirubin is ≥ [ADDRESS_1085640] or their partner will take effective measures (ie, double-barrier method) to 
prevent pregnancy during the course of the trial and for [ADDRESS_1085641] is sterile (ie, females who have had a bilateral oophorectomy or 
hysterectomy or who have been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months; or 
men who have had a bilateral orchidectomy) or remains abstinent, [ADDRESS_1085642] be used:  vasectomy, tubal ligation, vaginal diaphragm, intrauterine 
device, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], birth control depot injection, birth control implant, birth control 
patch, condom with spermicide, or sponge with spermicide.  Any single method of birth 
control, including vasectomy and tubal ligation, may fail, leading to pregnancy.  The 
contraceptive method will be documented at each trial visit.
Before enrolling females in this clinical trial, investigators must review the below 
guidelines about trial participation with all females.  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_78609]:
•General information
•Informed consent form
•Pregnancy prevention information
•Drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives
•Contraceptives in current use
•Guidelines for the follow up of a reported pregnancy
Before trial enrollment, females must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy.  The subject must provide assent or e-sign the electronic ICF stating that the 
above-mentioned risk factors and the consequences were discussed with her. 
A urine or serum pregnancy test for human chorionic gonadotropin will be performed at 
screening on all female subjects.  At any time during the trial if a urine test is performed 
and is positive, the investigator will follow up with a confirmatory serum test.Clinical Study Report 331-10-[ADDRESS_1085643] they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual cycle).
If a subject is suspected to be pregnant before she receives IMP, the IMP administration 
must be withheld until the results of serum pregnancy tests are available.  If the 
pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive the IMP and must not be enrolled in 
the trial.  If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is taking IMP, the IMP must be 
withheld immediately (if reasonable, taking into consideration any potential withdrawal 
risks) until the result of the pregnancy test is known.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the IMP 
will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary for subject safety) and the subject will be withdrawn from the trial.  Exceptions 
to trial discontinuation may be considered for life-threatening conditions only after 
consultations with the Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department (see the cover 
page of this protocol for contact [CONTACT_3031]).
The investigator must immediately notify the sponsor of any pregnancy associated with 
IMP exposure during the trial and for [ADDRESS_1085644] 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form(s) for monitoring the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Protocol-required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (eg, x-ray studies).  Other appropriate 
pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered, if indicated.  In addition, the 
investigator must report to the sponsor, on appropriate Pregnancy Surveillance Form(s), 
follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and 
neonatal outcome.  Infants will be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1085645] the sponsor/Clinical Research Organization 
(CRO) medical advisor to discuss their rationale for unblinding.  However, to prevent 
delays to the investigator or medical personnel responding to a potentially emergent 
situation, unblinding of IMP will not be dependent upon the investigator receiving 
approval from the sponsor/CRO medical advisor (ie, the investigator will be able to 
obtain the code break information independent of the sponsor/CRO medical advisor).  
The investigator must contact [CONTACT_456]/CRO medical advisor by [CONTACT_16062] e-mail 
with an explanation of the need for opening the treatment assignment code within Clinical Study Report 331-10-[ADDRESS_1085646] be notified immediately (see the cover page of this 
protocol for contact [CONTACT_3031]).  Documentation of breaking the blind should be 
recorded in the subject’s medical record with the date and time the blind was broken and 
the names of the personnel involved.  Once the blind is broken for a subject, that subject 
may not reinitiate treatment with the IMP.
5.[ADDRESS_1085647] be recorded on the 
AE screen in eSource with the current status noted.  For this trial, information on AEs 
will be followed for up to 21 (± 2) days after the last dose of IMP has been administered.  
All nonserious events that are ongoing at the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_788498].  For any AE having been identified throughout the trial, during 
analysis, additional relevant medical history information may be requested to further 
ascertain causality (including, but not limited to, information such as risk-related 
behavior, family history and occupation).
5.7.2 Follow-up of Serious Adverse Events
This trial requires that subjects be actively monitored for SAEs up to 21 (± 2) days after 
the last dose of IMP is administered and as described below in Section 5.7.3.
Serious adverse events that are identified or ongoing at the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_788499] 5.3.  This may i nclude unresolved previously 
reported SAEs, or new SAEs.  The investigator will follow SAEs until the events are 
resolved, stabilized, or the subject is lost to follow-up.  Resolution means that the subject 
has returned to the baseline state of health and stabilized means that the investigator does 
not expect any further improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition.  The 
investigator will continue to report any significant follow-up information to the sponsor 
up to the point the event has been resolved.Clinical Study Report 331-10-234 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-10-234
Confidential - Proprietary Information 79 Version 5.0, 05 Jul 2022The core dataset for all efficacy analyses is based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, 
which is defined in the Efficacy Sample above.  The observed case (OC) dataset will be 
used in the primary analysis of efficacy endpoints.  As described below, in order to 
handle missing data and restrictions imposed by [CONTACT_788500] (eg, change 
from baseline analysis), datasets derived from the ITT population will be used for the 
efficacy analyses.
7.[ADDRESS_1085648].
In general, missing data will be handled by [CONTACT_788501] 
(MMRM) methodology based on all data from protocol-specified visits in the ITT 
population under the assumption of missing at random (MAR), which is a reasonable 
assumption in longitudinal clinical trials with psychiatric drugs.  However, the possibility 
of “missing not at random” (MNAR) data can never be ruled out.  As sensitivity analyses, 
multiple imputation (MI) will be used to explore data missing mechanisms of MNAR and 
investigate the response profile of dropout reasons.  Details of these exploratory analyses 
will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
The OC dataset will consist of actual observations recorded at each visit during 
double-blind treatment and no missing data will be imputed.  An MMRM will be 
performed on the OC dataset.
In order to assess sensitivity of results due to missing data, a last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) analysis will be performed as a sensitivity analysis.  In contrast to the 
OC dataset, the LOCF dataset will include data recorded at a scheduled visit, ie, all OC 
data, or, if no observation is recorded at that visit, data carried forward from the 
previously scheduled visit.  Baseline data will not be carried forward to impute missing 
values for the LOCF dataset.Clinical Study Report 331-10-[ADDRESS_1085649] in the protocol uses the 
hypothetical strategy specified in the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E9 
Addendum.  The objective of the primary analysis is to compare the efficacy of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_788456].  The estimand, or target 
of estimation, following this hypothetical strategy is the treatment effect seen, assuming 
that no withdrawals occurred.  Subjects who withdraw from IMP treatment either could 
have lost their treatment effect had the subjects not taken any other treatment after 
withdrawal or could have had their treatment effect masked had the subjects taken other 
treatment after withdrawal.  This would mean that any observations made after subjects 
stop IMP will most likely not contribute relevant information about the treatment effect 
of the drug. Due to this strategy, the last efficacy assessment after premature trial 
discontinuation will be done only once at the ET Visit.  Every effort will be made to 
complete all of the ET evaluations prior to administering any additional medications for 
the treatment of schizophrenia or other prohibited medications.  In the case of terminal or 
lost to follow-up events, no ET evaluations would be expected, and only scheduled 
assessments would be performed before such an event occurred.
The primary estimand for this trial is defined by [CONTACT_13673]:
•Target Population: Adolescent subjects 13 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia who 
met the protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria and were qualified for the 
Efficacy Sample
•Endpoint: Change from Baseline to Week 6 in the PANSS Total Score
•Intercurrent Events: Refers to premature treatment discontinuation (ie, early dropout) 
prior to Week 6 attributable to adverse events, lack of efficacy, withdrawal of

•Measure of Intervention Effect:  Difference in endpoint means between the 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_788457].
In this hypothetical strategy, the event of withdrawing IMP is considered MAR, and the 
primary endpoint of the trial could be considered as a combination of the responses of on 
treatment completers at Week [ADDRESS_1085650] is brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2–[ADDRESS_1085651] covariates of baseline and 
baseline by [CONTACT_788502] 1 to 
Week 6 in PANSS Total Score based on all available data (OC dataset).  The data will be 
modeled using an unstructured variance covariance matrix for the within subject 
variation.  A statistical test of the least squares (LS) mean differences at Week 6 of the 
MMRM analysis will serve as the analysis of the primary endpoint.  The Efficacy Sample 
will be used in the analysis of the primary endpoint.  The comparison will be tested at a 
significance level of 0.05 (2-side).
In case there is a convergence problem with the MMRM model with the unstructured 
variance covariance matrix, the following structures other than unstructured will be used 
in order of 1) heterogeneous toeplitz, 2) heterogeneous autoregressive of order 1, and 
3) heterogeneous compound symmetry, and the first (co)variance structure converging to 
the best fit will be used as the primary analysis.  If a structured covariance has to be used, 
the “sandwich” estimator of the standard error of the fixed effects parameters will be used 
in order to deal with possible model misspecification of the covariance matrix.  
In order to explore the robustness of the primary analysis based on the MAR assumption, 
sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint under the MNAR assumption will be 
conducted, using a pattern-mixture model. 
Additional details, including pooling of small trial sites are provided in the SAP.

and regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_20618]/documents by 
[CONTACT_331690].  In all cases, subject confidentiality must be 
maintained in accordance with local regulatory requirements.
9.2 Data Collection
Source document and source data will be captured electronically in this trial and will 
meet the same fundamental elements of data quality (eg, attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, and accurate) as paper records.  These data will be collected 
into a system that is fully validated.  Changes to the data will be captured by [CONTACT_740900].
The trial site will be given a tablet to directly record subject data and clinical 
observations on electronic forms.  Designated trial site staff will not be given access to 
the system until they have been appropriately trained.  Information to be originally 
captured and reviewed electronically shall include details of the subject visit and the 
protocol-required assessments performed as a part of these visits, medical history, AEs, 
and concomitant medications.  Because this trial is using an electronic source record as 
the original point of data capture, there is no additional data entry step for the site for data 
collected directly into the application - rather, the electronic source record directly 
populates the trial database.
Some data may be captured via paper and then entered into the eSource.  These and any 
other data treated in this manner will be source data verified by [CONTACT_788506], and the location of the source data (ie, eSource, paper, or a local electronic 
system) will be documented before the trial start.  Any changes to information in paper Clinical Study Report 331-10-234 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

staff member authorized to make the change.  Changes will be made by [CONTACT_2724] a single 
line through erroneous data (so as not to obliterate the original data), and clearly entering 
the correct data (eg, wrong data right data).  If the reason for the change is not apparent, a 
brief explanation for the change will be written in the source documentation by [CONTACT_984].
Another exception will be safety laboratory data, where the official source documentation 
will be considered the report issued by [CONTACT_444491].
Remote monitoring of the original electronic source record will take place, however 
on-site monitoring inspections will continue to take place in order to review data entry 
source documentation directly captured on paper and transcribed into the system, to 
ensure protocol adherence, to assess site operational capabilities and to perform other 
monitoring activities that cannot be performed remotely.  
At the end of the trial, the investigator must certify that the data entered into the eSource 
application are complete and accurate.  After database lock, the investigator will receive 
an electronic copy of the subject data. 
9.3 File Management at the Trial Site
The investigator will ensure that the trial site file is maintained in accordance with 
Section 8 of the ICH GCP Guideline E6 and as required by [CONTACT_13762].  
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature 
destruction of these documents.  Per regulatory guidelines, sites must retain any 
documents that are uploaded to eSource.

3 periods:
•A period of at least 2 years after the date on which approval to market the drug is 
obtained (or if IMP development is discontinued, the date regulatory authorities were 
notified of discontinuation); OR
•A period of at least 3 years after the sponsor notifies the investigator that the final 
report has been filed with regulatory authorities.
•Longer, region-specific storage requirements, if applicable.Clinical Study Report 331-10-[ADDRESS_1085661] not dispose of any records relevant to this trial without either 
(1) written permission from the sponsor or (2) provision of an opportunity for sponsor to 
collect such records.  The investigator will be responsible to maintain adequate and 
accurate electronic or hard copy source documents of all observations and data generated 
during this trial including any data clarification forms received from the sponsor.  Such 
documentation is subject to inspection by [CONTACT_331692].  
If the investigator withdraws from the trial (eg, due to relocation or retirement), all 
trial-related records should be transferred to a mutually agreed-upon designee within a 
sponsor-specified timeframe.  Notice of such transfer will be given to the sponsor in 
writing.
10 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
10.1 Monitoring
The sponsor has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to follow this trial in accordance 
with established research principles, the ICH E6 GCP:  Consolidated Guidance, and 
applicable regulatory requirements and local laws.  As part of a concerted effort to fulfill 
these obligations (maintain current personal knowledge of the progress of the trial), the 
sponsor’s monitors will visit the site during the trial, as well as communicate frequently 
via telephone, e-mail, and written communications.  In addition, all investigators and 
clinical site personnel will undergo initial and ongoing training for this particular trial, 
and this training will be clearly documented.
10.2 Auditing
The sponsor’s Quality Assurance Unit (or representative) may conduct trial site audits.  
Audits will include, but are not limited to, IMP supply, presence of required documents, 
the informed consent process, and comparison of eSource with source documents.  The 
investigator agrees to participate with audits.
Regulatory authorities may inspect the investigator site during or after the trial.  The 
investigator will cooperate with such inspections and will contact [CONTACT_331687].
[ADDRESS_1085662] be conducted in compliance with the protocol, FDA regulations, ICH GCP 
Guideline (E6), international ethical principles derived from the Declaration of Helsinki 
and Council for International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS) guidelines, and

that documentation to the sponsor.  The IRB/IEC will evaluate the ethical, scientific, and 
medical appropriateness of the trial.  Further, in preparing and using screens in eSource, 
the investigator, subinvestigator, and their staff will take measures to ensure adequate 
care in protecting subject privacy.  To this end, a subject number and subject 
identification code will be used to identify each subject.
Financial aspects, subject insurance and the publication policy for the trial will be 
documented in the agreement between the sponsor and the investigator.
12 Confidentiality
All information generated in this trial will be considered confidential and will not be 
disclosed to anyone not directly concerned with the trial without the sponsor’s prior 
written permission.  Subject confidentiality requirements of the region(s) where the trial 
is conducted will be met.  However, authorized regulatory officials and sponsor personnel 
(or their representatives) may be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records, 
consistent with local requirements.  All IMPs, subject bodily fluids, or other materials 
collected shall be used solely in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to 
in writing by [CONTACT_456].
Subjects will be identified only by [CONTACT_772998].  If further subject 
identification is required, subjects’ full names may be made known to a regulatory 
agency or other authorized officials if necessary, subject to local regulations.
13 Amendment Policy
The investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without the sponsor’s prior 
written consent and subsequent approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1686]/IEC.  Any 
permanent change to the protocol, whether an overall change or a change for specific trial 
site(s), must be handled as a protocol amendment.  Any amendment will be written by [CONTACT_103].  Each amendment will be submitted to the IRB/IEC, as required by [CONTACT_13125].  Except for “administrative” or “non-substantial” amendments, investigators 
will wait for IRB/IEC approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_444443](s).  Administrative amendments are defined as having no effect 
on the safety of subjects, conduct or management of the trial, trial design, or the quality 
or safety of IMP(s) used in the trial.  A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to subjects should be implemented immediately after agreement by [CONTACT_331694], followed by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC notification within local applicable Clinical Study Report 331-10-234 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Confidential - Proprietary Information 97 Version 5.0, 05 Jul 2022Appendix 4 Handling and Shipment of Bioanalytical Samples
Handling of Specimens
Labels should be secured to each storage tube.  Labels should contain the following 
information:  Protocol number; subject number; time point of sample collection; and 
aliquot/matrix (eg, Plasma Aliquot 1 or Plasma Aliquot 2).  All tubes must be labeled 
such that the protocol number, date of collections, and protocol time can be verified.  It is 
important to note the exact time of the blood collection in eSource, not the scheduled 
time for the drawing.
Pharmacokinetic Plasma Samples
Collect PK blood samples using 4-mL draw green-top Vacutainer evacuated collection 
tubes containing sodium heparin.  After obtaining the blood sample, mix the collection 
tube thoroughly by [CONTACT_788507]/water bath.  
Within 45 minutes of collection, process collection tubes in a refrigerated centrifuge set 
at approximately 2000 x G for 15 minutes at approximately 5C ± 3°C.  Transfer 
duplicate plasma aliquots of approximately equal volume, using standard laboratory 
technique, into 2 appropriately labeled storage tubes.  Within 90 minutes of collection, 
store both plasma aliquot samples in a freezer set to maintain a temperature 
−70C ± 10°C.  Specimens must be neatly packed and restrained in an insulated container 
appropriate for dry ice, and organized by [CONTACT_788508].  Completely fill the 
insulated container and avoid air spaces that allow evaporation of the dry ice.  Samples 
must be shipped via an overnight carrier, Monday through Thursday, to the central 
laboratory.  Shipments should not be made on Fridays, Saturdays, or any day prior to a 
holiday.  Plasma Aliquot 1 samples should be shipped preferably on the day of collection 
or else within 1 week of sample collection.  Plasma Aliquot 2 specimens should be 
shipped to the central laboratory using the same procedure, once confirmation is received 
that the Plasma Aliquot 1 specimen was received. 
Pharmacogenomics Sample
Blood samples for pharmacogenomic analysis will be collected into one 6-mL K2EDTA 
Vacutainer tube.  Each tube should be gently inverted 10 times to ensure proper mixing 
with the anticoagulant.  Samples should be refrigerated in an upright position at 4 C for 
at least one day (no longer than 4 days).  The samples should then be stored at -20 C or 
below prior to shipment.  If refrigerating is not possible, samples may be frozen directly Clinical Study Report 331-10-[ADDRESS_1085669] be shipped to the central laboratory via an overnight carrier, 
Monday through Thursday, preferably on the day of collection or else within 1 week of

The C-GAS is a 100-point rating scale measuring psychological, social, and school 
functioning for children aged 6-17.  It was adapted from the Adult Global Assessment 
Scale and is a valid and reliable tool for rating a child’s general level of functioning on a 
health-illness continuum. 
100-91Superior functioning in all areas (at home, at school and with peers), involved in a range or 
activities and has many interests (e.g., has hobbies or participates in extracurricular activities 
or belongs to an organized group such as Scouts, etc.). Likable, confident, “everyday” 
worries never get out of hand. Doing well in school, no symptoms
90-81 Good functioning in all areas. Secure in family, school and with peers. There may be 
transient difficulties and “everyday” worries that occasionally get out of hand (e.g. mild 
anxiety associated with an important exam, occasional “blow ups” with siblings, parents or 
peers).
80-71 No more than slight impairment in functioning at home, at school, or with peers. Some 
disturbance of behavior or emotional distress may be present in response to life stresses (e.g., 
parental separations, deaths, births of a sib) but these are brief and interference with 
functioning is transient. Such children are only minimally disturbing to others who are not 
considered deviant by [CONTACT_420466].
70-61 Some difficulty in a single area, but generally functioning pretty well, (e.g., sporadic or 
isolated antisocial acts, such as occasionally playing hooky or petty theft; consistent minor 
difficulties with school work, mood changes of brief duration; fears and anxieties which do 
not lead to gross avoidance behavior; self doubts). Has some meaningful interpersonal 
relationships. Most people who do not know the child well would not consider him/her 
deviant but those who do know him/her well might express concern.

aggression without clear instigation; markedly withdrawn and isolated behavior due to either 
mood or thought disturbance, suicidal attempts with clear lethal intent. Such children are 
likely to require special schooling or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_788467] (but this is

(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)Lifetime Past 1 
year
Actual Attempt: 
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior 
was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any 
intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There 
does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls 
trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the 
behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other 
intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). 
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be 
inferred.

Have you done anything to harm yourself?
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?
What did you do?

Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?

Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself 
(like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?

Interrupted Attempt:  
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self-injurious 
act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this 
becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, 
gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the 
trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and 
taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is 
stopped from doing so.

actually have engaged in any self-destructive behavior. Examples are similar to interrupted attempts, 
except that the individual stops him/herself, instead of being stopped by [CONTACT_6615].

verbalization or thought, such as assembling a specific method (e.g., buying pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], purchasing a gun) or 
preparing for one’s death by [CONTACT_20673] (e.g., giving things away, writing a suicide note).

Confidential - Proprietary Information 133 Version 5.0, 05 Jul 2022SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)Since Last 
Visit
Actual Attempt: 
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part 
thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated 
with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or 
harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no 
injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or 
circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be 
inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, 
but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. 
Have you made a suicide attempt?
Have you done anything to harm yourself?
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?
What did you do?
Did you______ as a way to end your life? 
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____? 
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to 
relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior 
without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:  
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self-injurious act (if not 
for that, actual attempt would have occurred).
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an 
attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by 
[CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, 
it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has 
noose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

something stopped you before you actually did anything?

Aborted Attempt:  
When person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attempt, but stops themselves before they actually have 
engaged in any self-destructive behavior. Examples are similar to interrupted attempts, except that the individual 
stops him/herself, instead of being stopped by [CONTACT_6615].

Preparatory Acts or Behavior:
Acts or preparation towards imminently making a suicide attempt. This can include anything beyond a 
verbalization or thought, such as assembling a specific method (e.g., buying pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], purchasing a gun) or preparing 
for one’s death by [CONTACT_20673] (e.g., giving things away, writing a suicide note).

Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no actual medical 
damage, had potential for very serious lethality: put gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no 
medical damage; laying on train tracks with oncoming train but pulled away before run over).

Investigator's Brochure) and agree that it contains all the ethical, legal and scientific information 
necessary to conduct this trial in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practices and as 
described herein and in the sponsor's (or designee's) Clinical Trial Agreement.
I will provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_35008], nurses, and other professional personnel to 
whom I delegate trial responsibilities. I will discuss the protocol with them to ensure that they are 
sufficiently informed regarding the investigational new drug, OPC-[ZIP_CODE], the concurrent 
medications, the efficacy and safety parameters and the conduct of the trial in general. I am 
aware that this protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) or receive a 
favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_572581] (IEC) responsible for such matters in the 
clinical trial facility where OPC-[ZIP_CODE] will be tested prior to commencement of this trial. I agree to 
adhere strictly to the attached protocol (unless amended in the manner set forth in the sponsor's 
Clinical Trial Agreement, at which time I agree to adhere strictly to the protocol as amended).
I understand that this IRB- or IEC-approved protocol will be submitted to the appropriate 
regulatory authority/ies by [CONTACT_456]. I agree that clinical data entered on case report forms by 
[CONTACT_444493], such as for submission to 
governmental regulatory authorities or in combination with clinical data gathered from other 
research sites, whenever applicable. I agree to allow sponsor and designee monitors and 
auditors full access to all medical records at the research facility for subjects screened or enrolled 
in the trial.
I agree to await IRB/IEC approval before implementation of any substantial amendments to this 
protocol. If, however, there is an immediate hazard to subjects, I will implement the amendment 
immediately, and provide the information to the IRB/IEC within the required local applicable 
timelines. Administrative changes to the protocol will be transmitted to the IRB/IEC for 
informational purposes only, if required by [CONTACT_427].
I agree to provide all subjects with informed consent forms, as required by [CONTACT_35212]. I agree to report to the sponsor any adverse experiences in 
accordance with the terms of the sponsor's Clinical Trial Agreement and the relevant regional

3 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease Background  
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem that increases risks of end-
stage renal disease (ESRD) , cardiovascular disease (CVD) , fractures, and death, and it poses 
an enormous financial burden on the US health system.1-[ADDRESS_600494].   
CKD is complicated by [CONTACT_468553], characterized by [CONTACT_468554], calcitriol and klotho deficiency, and elevated levels of parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).[ADDRESS_600495], CVD and death.11-13  As potential explanatory mechanisms, phosphate excess 
induces arterial stiffness due to vascular calcification, and FGF23 excess contributes directly to the pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
14,[ADDRESS_600496] 
effectively reduce phosphate and FGF23  blood levels  in CKD.   We plan to advance this 
approach in future randomized clinical trials .   
The objective of this study is to perform a detailed physiologic study of healthy volunteers to 
assess the sho rt-term effects of nicotinamide alone, lanthanum carbonate alone, or both in 
combination,  on phosphate homeostasis.  The results from healthy volunteers will provide 
information needed for optimal design of studies for patients with CKD.  
1.2 Study Agent(s) /Devices Background and Associated Known Toxicities 
Nicotinamide will be used  at a dose of [ADDRESS_600497] -hoc analysis of a randomized 
study of niacin in 327 patients with CKD stages 2 and 3,  Rao et al found that, in addition to 
reducing phosphate levels  in the blood, niacin  decreased FGF23 levels by 10.9% from baseline 
over [ADDRESS_600498] demonstrated that this dose safely 
reduced urinary phosphate, signifying effective phosphate binding, i n CKD stages 3 −4.26,27  
Importantly, lanthanum carbonate has been used in the hemodialysis population, with 6 -year 
long safety data demonstrating a good safety profile.28 Lanthanum carbonate has also been 
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
4 used in healthy volunteers in whom it has also been found to be safe.  As in patients with CKD, 
doses of 1000 mg three times daily in healthy volunteers achieve maximal reduction in 24 -hour 
urine.29  
1.3 Other Agents /Devices  
N/A 
1.[ADDRESS_600499] changes following proposed interventions in  both 24 -hour and fractional urinary 
phosphate excretion.   
  
For this detailed physiologic study, we chose to use the 2x2 factorial  study design because we 
are specifically interested  in investigating  the effects of the combined interventions as compared 
to the effects of the placebo and to each monotherapy group.   
 
We chose plasma  phosphate, 24- hour urine phosphate, fractional urinary excretion of 
phosphate (FEPI) , FGF23 and PTH as end -points because we are interested in the effects of 
the interventions on phosphate handling and mineral metabolism (See Table).  Additional end-points will include markers of bone turnover, including N terminal propeptide of Type 1 
procollagen (P1NP) and C terminal cross -linked peptide (CTX) to assess the influence of the 
interventions on bone metabolism.

12 6.0        Response Criteria  
Plasma  Phosphate levels, CBC, LFTs, CK  will be monitored as safety 
labs through the intervention period.  
 
6.1   Safety/tolerability  
 
Analyses  of safety  will be performed for all patients having received at 
least one dose of study drug.  
7.[ADDRESS_600513] be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  
 
All patients experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug/device , will be monitored until:  
 the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse event return to baseline;  
 any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline;  
 there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the changes observed; or  
 death.  
7.2 Definitions  
7.2.1  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal  laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  
7.2.2  Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE is graded as follows:  
Mild (grade 1):  the event caus es discomfort without disruption of normal 
daily activities. 
Moderate (grade 2):  t he event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities. 
Severe (grade 3):  t he event makes the patient unable to perform normal 
daily activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status.  
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
13 Life-threatening (grade 4):  the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event.  
Fatal (grade 5):  t he event caused death.  
7.2.3  Serious  Adverse Events  
A “serious” adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any 
untoward medical occurrence that:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results in death.  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease 
should be reported as event (SAE) itself.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is life -threatening.  
(the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9959] ≥ 24  hours . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is an important medical event  
Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the 
judgment of the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be 
considered for reporting as a serious adverse event . The event 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“.  
For example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; convulsions that 
may not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; development of drug abuse or 
drug dependency.  
7.3 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires 
Expedited Reporting  
Step 1: Identify the type of adverse ev ent   
 
Step 2: Grade the adverse event  
 
Step 3: Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.

14 Note : This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_600514] dose 
of treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) 
must also be reported accordingly.  
 
Step 4: Determine the prior experience of the adverse event .  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent . An adverse event is considered unexpected, for 
expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not  listed in:  
• the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section 
of this protocol;  
• the drug package insert;  
• the current Investigator’s Brochure  
7.4 Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
7.4.1  Expedited Reporting  
• The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9960] [ADDRESS_600515] administration of the study drug.  
• The IRB must be notified within 10 bus iness days of “any 
unanticipated problems involving ri sk to subjects or others” 
(UPR/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]).  
The following events meet the definition of UPR:  
1. Any serious event (injuries, side effects, deaths or other problems), which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_89644], involved risk to subjects or others, and was 
possibly related to the research procedures.  
2. Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB -
approved protocol that alters the level of risk.  
3. Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to 
eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research subject.  
4. Any new information (e.g., publication, safety monitoring report, 
updated sponsor safety report), interim result or other finding that 
indicates an unexpected change to the risk/benefit ratio for the 
research.  
5. Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or others.  
6. Any complaint of a subject that indicates an unanticipated risk or 
that cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_079].

The goal of the planned labor atory correlative studies is to understand how changes in 
phosphate homeostasis affect endocrine regulators of bone and mineral metabolism and 
markers of bone turnover.  Additional stored samples will be archived for future analyses 
of newly discovered bio markers related to bone and mineral homeostasis and its 
regulation. S ubmission of samples for correlativ e studies is mandatory. The consent 
form will have a statement that will inform participants about the planned use of archived samples. Participants who chose not to have their samples archived may opt out.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is a 2- week , randomized, double- blinded, 2x2 factorial design study  of 80 healthy 
volunteers (20 in each of the four treatment groups) investigating the effects of the 
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
18 interventions on changes in plasma  and urinary phosphate.  Participants will be 
randomized to one of the four groups: 1) lanthanum carbonate + nicotinamide; 2) 
lanthanum carbonate + n icotinamide placebo; 3) lanthanum carbonate placebo + 
nicotinamide; 4) lanthanum carbonate placebo + nicotinamide placebo.  
The end- points are listed in the table below:  
 
Summary of End Points  
End-Point  Primary  Secondary  Justification  
Plasma  Phosphate  X  Marker of phosphate handling  
24-hr Urine 
Phosphate  X  Marker of phosphate handling  
FePI  X  Marker of phosphate handling  
PTH  X Hormonal regulator of mineral metabolism  
FGF23   X Hormonal regulator of mineral metabolism  
P1NP   X Bone formation marker  
CTX  X Bone resorption marker  
 
10.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
Assumptions based on prior studies:  
• Data on effects of nicotinamide on blood  or urine phosphate in healthy volunteers are 
not available.  
• Similiarly, data on the combined use of the nicotinamide and lanthum carbonate are 
lacking.  
• Therefore, we relied on published data of the effects on lanthanum carbonate on 24-hour urine phosphate.  In previous short -term studies of healthy volunteers, 
lanthanum carbonate at the dose that we will use in our study decreased 24- hour 
urine phosphate by 236 to 468 mg/day.
[ADDRESS_600520] deviation of 
change in 24- hour urine phosphate ranged from 168 to 294 mg/day.29  
 
Derivation of the sample size for this study:  
Using th e PS Power and Sample Size calculator  (independent t test) , we es timated that 
a sample size of 20 participants per group will yield 80% power to detect a difference of 
273 mg/dl in urine phosphate, at α=0. 05, assuming a within group SD of the change in 
24-hour urine phosphate  of 300 mg/day .  Assuming a conservative within g roup SD of 
the change in plasma phosphate of 0.55 mg/dl, the sample size of [ADDRESS_600521] a difference as small as 0. 50 mg/dl in plasma phosphate.   
Importantly, we based our power calculations on t -tests that compare pre to post 
intervention changes across two groups.  Because the repeated measures analyses we 
will employ using linear mixed models will reduce within- subject variability, we expect to 
have more power than is tabulated above and view the presented power calculations as 
conservative estimates.   Additionally, power for main effects analyses (effects of 
lanthanum carbonate alone and nicotinamide alone; 4 0 participants per groups; margin 
comparison) will be greater than the presented power for comparisons of dual treatment to placebo ( 20 participants per group; individual cell comparison).  
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
19 10.3 Data Analyses Plans  
• We will study changes over time in absolute levels of the primary and secondary 
end-points.   
• We will use mixed -model, repeated -measures analyses to assess the changes.  
• Model terms will include:  
o fixed -effects treatment terms ( treatment group ); 
o the interaction between each treatment and time (nicotinamide x time and lanthanum carbonate x time);  
o the interaction between treatments (nicotinamide x lanthanum carbonate);  
o the interaction between treatments and time (nicotinamide x lanthanum 
carbonate x time);  
o random -effects terms, connoting individual participants.  
• If the interaction term between treatments and time (nicotinamide x lanthanum 
carbonate x time) is significant, we will compare the response in the dual 
intervention group to the placebo group.   
• If the interaction term between treatments and time (nicotinami de x lanthanum 
carbonate x time) is not significant, we will examine the main effects of each 
intervention .   
• We will use natural log transformation for end points with skewed distribution.  
• If there are significant differences (p<0.05) in age, gender and baseline eGFR 
across randomized treatment groups, we wi ll adjust for these covariates.  
• Standard descriptive  analyses will be used for safety evaluations .

For any such emergency modification implemented, a IRB modification 
form must be completed within five (5) business days of making the 
change.  
11.6.2  Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
All other planned deviations from the protocol must have prior approval by 
[CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_72616] . According to the IRB, a protocol 
deviation is any unplanned variance from an IRB approved protocol that:  
• Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or the value of the data collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if the variance:  
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study. 
STU00090161 
________________________________________________________________________ 
21 • Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
• Demonst rates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal 
regulations, State laws, or University policies.

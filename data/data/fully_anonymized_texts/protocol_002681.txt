 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
PROTOCOL TITLE  A Feasibility Trial using Molecular -guided therapy for the treatment of 
patients with relapsed and refractory childhood cancers  
PROTOCOL NUMBER  NMTRC 008  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT  Feasibility  
OBJECTIVES  Primary  
Determine feasibility of using tumor samples to assess genomic mRNA 
expression arrays and DNA Mutation Panels using predictive modeling 
to make real -time treatment decisions  for children with 
relapsed/refractory cancers . 
 
Secondary  
• To continue to evaluate the safety of allowing a molecular tumor 
board to determine individualized treatment plans  
• To determine the activity of treatments chosen based on:  
• Overall response rate (ORR)  
• Progression free survival (PFS)  
•  (Voluntary) To explore the relationship between tumor 
phenotype/genotype and response by [CONTACT_59506] a correlative biologic study  
• To compare PFS interval to PFS intervals of previous 
chemotherapy regimens since relapse for each subject . 
STUDY DESIGN  A prospective open label, multicenter study to evaluate efficacy  of 
molecularly guided therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory 
childhood cancers  
 
A total of [ADDRESS_64523] relapsed  on conventional therapy will be treated  
with molecular guided therapy.  
 
Subjects will be evaluated in 3 strata:  
• Stratum 1 : 16 subjects with refractory/relapsed neuroblastoma 
• Stratum 2 : 16 subjects with relapsed or refractory brain tumors  
Stratum 3 : 16 subjects with refractory or relapsed rare tumors  
 
Guided therapy will allow the use of any therapeutic combination (up 
to 4 agents) provided it  includes medications contained in the study 
report. All subject s will be followed for survival, disease response, 
progression and safety.  All subject s will be treated according to the 
discretion of the treating oncologist and study committee (minimum [ADDRESS_64524]). Extent of disease will be measured 
and assessed for changes throughout the course of the study.    
 
 
Clinical Protocol. NMTRC [ADDRESS_64525] histologically proven neuroblastoma , brain 
tumor, or rare tumor  and confirmation of refractory or recurrent 
disease with h istologic confirmation at diagnosis or at the time of 
recurrence/progression  
2. Subject s must be age >[ADDRESS_64526] be age   ≤ [ADDRESS_64527] m easurable disease as  demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_59507] a primary or metastatic site measuring 
more than 1 cm in any dimension by [CONTACT_59508] (CT or 
MRI); tumor must be accessible for biopsy.  Subject s with bone 
marrow only disease expected to be >7 5% tumor are eligible to 
enroll.  
5. Current disease state must be one for which there is currently no 
known curative therapy   
6. Lansky or Karnofsky Score must be more  than [ADDRESS_64528] an ANC > 
750/μl. 
8. Adequate liver function must be demons trated, defined as:  
a. Total  bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age 
AND 
b.  ALT  (SGPT ) < 10 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age  
9. A negative serum pregnancy test is required for female 
participants of child bearing potential (≥13 years of age or after onset of menses)  
10. Both male and female post -pubertal study subjects need to agree 
to use one of the more effective birth control methods during 
treatment and for six months after treatment is stopped. These 
methods include total abstinence (no sex), oral contraceptives 
(“the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]”), an intrauterine device (IUD), levonorgestrol implants 
(Norplant), or medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-
provera shots). If one of these cannot be used, contraceptive foam 
with a condom is recommended.  
11. Informed Consent: All subject s and/or legal guardians must sign 
informed written consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be 
obtained according to institutional guidelines  
Exclusion Criteria  
1. Subjects who have received any cytotoxic chemotherapy within 
the last [ADDRESS_64529] 14 days (radiation may be included in 
treatment decision after biopsy).  
3. Subject s receiving anti -tumor therapy for their disease or any 
investigational drug concurrently. 
Clinical Protocol. NMTRC [ADDRESS_64530] s with serious infection or a life -threatening illness 
(unrelated to tumor) that is > Grade 2 (NCI CTCAE V4.0), or 
active, serious infections requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy.  
5. Subject s with any other medical condition, including 
malabsorption syndromes, mental illness or substance abuse, 
deemed by [CONTACT_59509] a 
subject ’s ability to sign or the legal guardian’s ability to sign the 
informed consent, and subject ’s ability to cooperate and 
participate in the study  
 
Additional criteria:  
Subject s willing to participate in the correlative biologic studies will 
sign an additional consent form to provide tumor tissue . 
ESTIMATED NUMBER OF 
PATIENTS /GEOGRAPHIC 
REGIONS  48 evaluable ( 53-59 total) relapsed/refractory pediatric cancer  patients - 
16 neuroblastoma tumors, 16 brain tumors, and 16 rare tumors.  
Patients will enroll at Arnold Palmer Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MD 
Anderson Cancer Center Orlando)  ,St. Louis University /Cardinal 
Glennon Children's Medical Center , Helen DeVos Children’s Hospit al,

Efficacy Measures: Secondary objectives  
• Response:  
 To determine the overall response rate (ORR) by [CONTACT_59510] e by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional CT or MRI 
imaging and/or  by [CONTACT_59511].  
 Duration of response, defined as the period of time from when 
measurement criteria are met for complete response (CR) or 
partial response (PR), whichever is first recorded, until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease (PD) is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started)  
 The assessment of response will include the initial measurable 
targets and will be performed after cycle 2, then after every other cycle.  
• A subject will be defined as a responder if CR/PR is observed at 
any time of the treatment  
• Clinical response will be seen if stable disease and decrease in 
tumor markers by ≥ 50%  or CR of bone marrow.  
• Time to progression, defined as the period from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met taking as 
reference the screening measurements

Relapsed or refractory  neuroblastoma, brain tumors, and rare childhood tumors.  
 
1.2 Rationale  
 Lethality of Relapsed/Refractory Pediatric Cancers  is an Unmet Clinical Need . 
 Neuroblastoma  
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, with 700 new diagnoses projected for 2011. It accounts for 7% to 10% of childhood cancers [ 1, 2].  Whereas the prognosis 
for infants with neuroblastoma is generally good, currently only 30% of children diagnosed after 
12-15 months of age survive despi[INVESTIGATOR_59313] [ 3, 4].  Even with high- dose 
chemotherapy (HDC) followed
 by [CONTACT_59512] (HSCT) and 
maintenance therapy with retinoic acid the 5 -year event -free survival remains below 50% [5, 6].  
Long- term survival of patients who are treated with conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59314] 
<5%. As such, neuroblastoma accounts for 15% of all pediatric cancer deaths in the [LOCATION_002] 
[7]. Consequently, the evaluation of new drugs is strongly needed in this disease.  
Recent evidence has established the genetic heterogeneity of the disease and revealed the 
existence of several major molecular subsets that collectively may provide prognostic value for 
future disease management [ 8] [9]. While the poor prognosis for older neuroblastoma patients 
underscores the need for new treatment strategies, the elucidation of specific biologic subsets of 
neuroblastoma suggests a way to improve disease management. The current standard- of-care 
treatments for relapsed neuroblastoma include a variety of Phase II or Phase I studies that 
generally have only modest response rates (10% -35%) [4]. Even in responding patients, tumors 
often go on to further rapid relapses and novel strategies to treat this patient population are 
urgently needed. There are currently few treatment options from which pediatric oncologists can 
select with any degree of confidence to improve the management of multiply recurrent 
neuroblastoma patients. The current strategy is to add salvage therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59315], which often lead s to drug- related toxicity but may or may 
not extend life. The identification of agents that target specific molecular pathways associated 
with the development and/or progression of neoplastic diseases holds promise. Improved 
approaches that identify in a more rational (data- driven) fashion combinations of existing agents 
that are likely to be effective should result in a survival benefit in the clinical setting, while 
avoiding the toxicity associated with agents that are unlikely to be beneficial. [ 10]. 
 
CNS Tumors  
CNS tumors are the most common solid tumors in children, with 3000- 40 
00 new diagnoses each year.  CNS tumors account for approximately 25- 30% of all childhood 
cancers. Though many of these CNS tumors are quite treatable, the 5- year survival for pediatric 
CNS tumors is only 71% [11]. Patients who have relapsed and refractory CNS tumors are those 
most likely to succumb to their disease, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_59316], often 
followed by [CONTACT_59513] [12, 13]. Therefore, new treatment strategies are needed for control of CNS 
tumors.

Issued 12 June 2013  
  
There is a growing focus on treating CNS tumors based on the biology of the disease [14, 15] 
rather than with “one size fits all” therapy. Risk stratification in CNS tumors based on biology is 
increasingly understood to be a priority. For example, medulloblastoma has been broken into 4 biologic categories with different genetic mutations and different clinical outcomes [16-18]. 
Similar to neuroblastoma, these differences in the biology and clinical outcome of patients with 
medulloblastoma suggest new strategies to improve disease management. The current standard -
of-care treatments for relapsed CNS tumors include Phase I and Phase II therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59317], if any, responding patients [19, 20]. Again reflecting the challenges in neuroblastoma, 
responding patients with high grade CNS tumors often experience multiple relapses and are in 
dire need of novel treatment strategies. Improved approaches that can inform treatment regimens 
based on the biology of the disease could result in a survival benefit in this challenging patient 
population.  
 
Rare Cancers  
Although improvements in the past [ADDRESS_64533] led to markedly improved survival rates of approximately 80% overall for pediatric cancers, patients with relapsed, rare and advanced stage 
tumors still have a very poor prognosis. Soft tissue sarcomas account for ~ 7% of pediatric 
cancers, with 850 -900 new cases annually in the [LOCATION_002] [ 21].  Rhabdomyosarcoma, the 
most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents, affects nearly 350 children in the 
[LOCATION_002] each year [ 21].  Patients with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma have a poor prognosis 
with an overall survival rate of ~30% [ 22]. The non -rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas 
affect ~[ADDRESS_64534] long -term survival < 20% [ 23].  Malignant bone tumors (mainly Ewing’s Sarcoma 
and Osteosarcoma) account for 6% of childhood cancers, with ~400 cases of osteosarcoma and 
200 cases of Ewing’s Sarcoma diagnosed annually [ 21]. Patients with localized osteosarcoma, 
who have a poor response to pre -operative chemotherapy have a survival rate of around 50%, 
while patients with metastatic osteosarcoma or Ewing’s sarcoma disease at presentation, have a 
survival of < 20% [ 24, 25].  Renal Cancers account for ~6% of pediatric cancer diagnoses, with 
95% of cases being Wilms Tumor, which has a very favorable prognosis [ 21].  However, rare and 
high risk renal tumors such as metastatic anaplastic Wilms tumor, clear cell sarcoma of the 
kidney, renal cell carcinoma, and malignant rhabdoid tumor have an inferior outcome, with 
survival of < 20% [ 26, 27]. For all these patients survival remains poor, despi[INVESTIGATOR_59318] -
intensified multi- agent chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Therefore, new approaches 
such as targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59319].  
 
Molecular Networks as the Drug Target .  
It is now firmly established that cancer results from perturbations in the molecular networks 
within cellular systems that disturb the normal homeostatic state [ 28-30]. Fluctuations in these 
networks can result from genetic or epi[INVESTIGATOR_59320]/or changes in the molecular 
constitution of the tumor microenvironment, which collectively dictate the phenotype of the 
biological system. The molecular networks engaged during tumor development and/or 
progression are complex. Molecular networks have evolved to provide the ultimate level of 
cellular plasticity, allowing cells to adapt to or exploit extracellular cues within the local milieu [31]. The complexity of a tumor system is further exaggerated by [CONTACT_59514], which leads to an accelerated micro -evolutionary process that results in 
further cellular and tumor sub- system heterogeneity [ 32, 33]. This variability combined with the 
adaptability of many molecular pathways provides a somewhat predictable and highly probable 
path to resistance for any given agent that targets a subset of cellular systems within a tumor’s

 molecular and genetic repertoire [ 34]. A fundamental challenge in the area of targeted cancer 
treatment is how to identify optimal therapeutic combinations that can treat heterogeneous tumors 
that are both highly adaptive and that exhibit significant inter - and intra -patient variation [ 28, 35-
37]. Our proposal outlines an approach by [CONTACT_59515] a growing pharmacopeia [38, 39] in 
conjunction with standardized biomarker assessments to deliver targeted combinations of effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59321].  
 
Practice and Promise of Biomarkers for Patient Treatment Planning . 
A panel of individual biomarkers has recently been identified that can be used in the clinical 
setting to identify neuroblastoma patients most likely to respond to a specific therapy. For 
example, activation of the ALK gene through sequence variation mutations has been identified in 
a subset of neuroblastoma patients, and small -molecule inhibition of the ALK -encoded receptor 
tyrosine kinase caused cytotoxicity in affected neuroblastoma cell lines [ 40]. Such studies, in 
conjunction with a large body of in vitro and in vivo data, have further demonstrated that the 
efficacy of specific treatment modalities is dependent upon the molecular constitution of the 
tumor, and that the observed variations in tumor response to current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59322].  
 While individual biomarkers may be predictive of responses to specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], especially in the context of front -line treatment, a different approach to the management of patients with 
refractory disease is needed in order to identify effective treatments from the catalog of available agents. Advances in informatics and molecular technologies, coupled with our expanding knowledge of molecular networks and mechanism of action of the existing pharmacopeia, 
provide a great opportunity in translational medicine to develop a model that more accurately 
predicts tumor response. The studies outlined in this proposal are a step in the development of personalized oncology, in which each patient is truly treated individually based upon the 
systematic molecular analysis of their disease. Our project is focused on testing the merits of a 
specific data- driven predictive method through which any number of drugs in our current 
knowledge base has a chance of being recommended, of these only the FDA approved drugs 
listed in Appendix III will be used. Although this novel approach to personalized therapeutics 
brings with it to the concern that toxicities that may arise from novel combinations of agents, it is 
strongly felt by [CONTACT_59516] a committee 
of highly qualified physicians and pharmacist s in order to identify drug candidates for 
consideration in the treatment of a patient population with few alternative options is a worthwhile 
endeavor. The systematic biomarker -driven approach outlined in this proposal, by [CONTACT_59517] a 
combination of drugs targeting the specific molecular composition of a tumor —irrespective of 
tumor classification or anatomical origin — provides a feasible alternative to the conventional 
approach that targets specific organs or tissues without consideration of the underlying tumor 
biology.  
 Validation of Gene Expression as a Predictive Biomarker.  
The determination of gene transcript abundance through gene expression profiling has been frequently exploited in biomarker research. The mRNA analyte provides an estimation of the dynamic molecular events within a biological specimen. Moreover, various technologies that 
permit gene expression profiling have provided a systematic and high- throughput means to assess 
multiple mRNA transcripts simultaneously within a  biological sample on a genomic scale, and 
have created an abundance of empi[INVESTIGATOR_59323] [ 41]. Within the field of cancer research, gene expression profiles derived 
Clinical Protocol. NMTRC [ADDRESS_64535] been used to identify molecular subtypes associated with 
tumor cell behavior, patient outcome and response to a wide range of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [ 42]. For example, 
gene expression signatures have been utilized to create a connectivity map in which the genomic 
consequences of drug exposure can be aligned with de -regulated genes within a tumor specimen 
to identify compounds that may reverse the tumorigenic genotype [43]. Screening of a large 
number of potential therapeutic agents in a panel of cancer cell lines with a baseline gene 
expression profile has permitted the association between a gene expression signature [CONTACT_59635] [ 44, 45]. Thus, a wealth of publicly available genomic 
datasets and predictive methodologies coupled with increasing evidence demonstrating the utility 
of gene expression signatures as a valid biomarker argues for increased efforts towards 
implementing a more systematic approach to molecular -based theranostics in the prospective 
clinical setting. We propose to integrate the results of different predictive methodologies based upon the consistent input of tumor -derived gene expression data, to provide consolidated 
information to the treating physician regarding treatment options with predicted efficacy. The 
predictive methods under evaluation include the rudimentary analysis of expression of target 
genes, as well as the more sophisticated analysis of molecular network topology and signature 
[CONTACT_59636][INVESTIGATOR_59324]. Throughout the project, we will seek to establish 
the potential predictive value of standardized gene expression data and the described 
methodologies for predicting efficacious agents for refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma patients 
and determine which, if any, of these individual predictive methodologies holds the most promise for further development as a diagnostic standard. Additionally, while beyond the scope of this 
specific proposal, the tumor resource created will also be used to assess the potential predictive 
value of emerging molecular technologies that assess other molecular aberrations associated with differential therapeutic response (such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, DNA sequencing, 
gene amplifications/deletions, gene promoter methylation, protein modifications, etc [ 28, 30]. 
  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_59325].  
In conjunction with community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59326], the Van Andel Research Institute under the direction of [CONTACT_59645] recently completed a proof -of-feasibility study 
in which a heterogeneous group of fifty late stage cancer patients were enrolled to determine the 
feasibility and potential impact of providing physician’s with molecular -based therapy predictions 
and to provide an early assessment of the first generation pr edictive methodologies. In this 
feasibility study, clinical investigators worked closely with [CONTACT_59645] to coordinate a multi -
disciplinary team that included individuals from adult and pediatric oncology, surgery, 
interventional and non- interventional radiology, pathology, pharmacy, clinical research, statistics, 
bioinformatics, and clinical and basic science laboratories.  
 
Table [ADDRESS_64536] of care diagnostic procedure were 
processed in a real -time fashion to obtain a gene expression profile from each qualified tumor 
specimen. Consistent with current practices, a series of essential quality control (QC) standards 
were implemented to ensure assay validity which included criteria regarding the proportion of 
viable tumor cells within surgical specimens, RNA quality, cDNA synthesis and amplification, 
GeneChip hybridization, data normalization and analysis. After obtaining a gene expression 
profile on the tumor specimen, researchers utilized the XB -BIS system to generate a standardize 
report for physicians to utilize in determining patient drug regimen. It is important to note that our

 current procedures permit a < 3 week  turnaround from receipt of an individual tumor sample to 
the generation of a standardized report predicting drug efficacy. Our ability to provide real time 
feedback in less than 3 weeks  is critical to permit the consideration of the predicted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59327], and is concomitant with the wash out period between the 
patient’s prior treatment and administration of a new regimen.  
 
Table I: Sample of patient feasibility assessments.  
 
 
While this first 50 -patient study was designed to determine the feasibility of the overall approach 
in different tumor types and to establish the necessary logistical workflow between the multiple 
disciplines, some anecdotal signs of tumor response and physician- reported patient benefit were 
observed (Table 1). As the Table illustrates, useful data was generated on 39/50 patients.  Of these,  24 out of the 34 cases utilized the report information.  Treatment decisions were based on 
the reported data for 24 patients, and 9 patients experienced tumor responses (37.5% response

 rate) determined through objective assessment of tumor burden (radiological imaging and/or 
biomarker endpoints, manuscript in preparation). While these findings remain anecdotal due to 
the uncontrolled nature of the study, they provide significant impetus to move ahead with the 
disease focused trial design outlined in this proposal. Moreover, these preliminary studies have demonstrated the feasibility of the approach in the real time prospective clinical setting.  
 
Use of Transcriptional Analysis to Assess Gene Target Expression.  
In the proof -of-feasibility study, the specific predictive methodologies were being developed and 
refined throughout, and led to the standardized methods outlined in this proposal. The most rudimentary method of transcriptional analysis relates to assessment of target gene expression. In 
some cases, the over -expression of a specific drug target at the transcriptional level is associated 
with efficacy of an inhibitor against the corresponding protein target; for example over -
expression of Her2 indicates use of trastuzumab in breast cancer [ 46]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_59328] (which is partially addressed 
through development of our network topology method described below), the simple assessment 
of target transcript abundance showed early promise in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. For example, a complete 
response was observed in a female adolescent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 
following the administration of a multi- kinase inhibitor that was selected based upon a significant 
over-expression of one of the drugs known targets ( Flt-3) at the transcriptional level (z -score 
>+10). Thus, while we now also incorporate a more sophisticated analytical method to infer target activation status based upon analysis of network topology (see below) and will also be 
testing the utility of well published signature -based methods for selecting drug candidates [43-45, 
47, 48] simple target gene expression remains a rational method for identification of drug 
candidates. The knowledge base utilizes the existing pharmacopeia’s postulated molecular 
mechanisms of action and contains molecular entities that are targeted by [CONTACT_8422], many of which 
are approved for human use. This includes several targets of particular relevance to neuroblastoma including VEGFA -VEGFR, TRK, mTOR, ALK, HDAC etc [ 8]. The 
transcriptional status of each of these targets is reported using the standardized z -score where the 
relative level of each target within an individual’s tumor is determined through a comparison with 
a whole body reference set.  
 
Novel Molecular Network Topology Analysis to Improve Utility of Targeted Pharmacopeia.  
A novel method developed in partnership with GeneGo over the past few years relates to the analysis of molecular network topology [ 49]. As stated above, the expression of a target gene 
does not necessarily equate to activation of the target protein. Nonetheless, we investigated the 
possibility of utilizing known protein- protein and protein- small molecule interactions within 
GeneGo’s MetaCore™  database (over 200,000 interactions) in conjunction with transcriptional 
data to infer key network targets that if modulated with a targeted agent, may disrupt the disease 
system(s) identified within each patient’s tumor. As with all methodologies in this proposal, 
tumor -derived transcriptional data (normalized to a reference set of normal whole body samples) 
provides the consistent input to the algorithm. This specific methodology was applied retrospectively to the data generated during the first 50- patient feasibility study and anecdotally 
corroborated the potential of this systematic approach for identifying key target hubs within perturbed molecular networks. For example, in the leukemic cells of the pediatric patient with ALL described above, Flt -3 was identified as a likely input point to an integrated transcriptional 
network. This patient responded well to a targeted therapy that inhibits multiple kinases including Flt-3. In an adult patient with metastatic non -small cell lung carcinoma, analysis of network 
topology highlighted Egfr as a likely input to a highly connected transcriptional network, and 
subsequent treatment with erlotinib showed some efficacy (patient exhibited a partial response). 
Clinical Protocol. NMTRC [ADDRESS_64537]. Webb’s group applied the methodology to a public dataset derived 
from the transcriptional profiling of skin from psoriasis patients. They were quickly able to 
identify several key targets and some associated targeted agents using this approach, many of which have been validated in the psoriasis literature. Collectively, we believe that the approach to 
the identification and subsequent analysis of neuroblastoma networks outlined in this proposal 
provides an exciting tool for systematically selecting network- based targeted regimens for the 
treatment of refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma patients. The systematic and automated 
approach described in this proposal is readily applicable to uncovering high quality therapeutic 
targets, and holds great promise for developi[INVESTIGATOR_59329]- based combinational treatment strategies 
for a wide range of diseases especially for diseases such as neuroblastoma which have a low 
survival rate and are in need of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. [ 2, 30]. 
 
 
Methods to be used in generating this reports are;  Drug  Target Expression Algorithm, Network 
Target Activity (Systems Biology Method, GeneGo); Drug Response Signatures Algorithm (Connectivity Map), and Drug Sensitivity Signatures Algorithm (PGSEA).   These are fu rthered 
explained in section 3 . 
 
Reference Set:   Whole body bank of normal tissue gene expression levels are used as the 
reference set for the normalization calculations.  Whole body reference is chosen to provide a 
wide variance of gene expression for comparison in order to better identify signal from tumor tissue.  This reference set will also help to decrease risk for toxicity as it will not identify targets 
that are highly expressed in normal tissues.
    
 
Normalization Calculations  
A z-score is calculated using the mean gene expression level from the reference set to the same 
gene's expression level from the patient's tumor.  A z -score is a quantitative measure of the 
number of standard deviations above or below the mean of the observed value (patient’s gene) in 
comparison to the same observed value (the same gene in the reference set).  Positive z- scores 
reflect the number of standard deviations that the observation being evaluated is above the mean 
(over -expressed) and conversely negative z -scores represent the number of standard deviations 
that the observation being evaluated is below the mean (under -expressed).  
 
Drug Knowledgebase  
The drug knowledgebase is comprised of publically available, peer -reviewed and clinically 
relevant pharmacological data.  Numerous sources contribute to the knowledgebase including 
GeneGo, DailyMed, DrugBank, UpToDate, Entrez Gene, Entrez Pubmed, PharmaGKB, 
MedTrust Online and MedTrack.  
 
 
Preclinical Model for Neuroblastoma Patients  
Neuroblastoma cells can be isolated from either tumor biopsies or the bone marrow of patients 
using flow cytometry panel (GD2, CD81, CD9, CD56, CD34, CD45)  or ficoll gradient isolation 
[50]. The bone marrow cells have been sorted and mRNA isolated for expression arrays. The 
patient cells have been cultured in our lab resulting in both adherent neuroblastoma cells and neurospheres. These cells have been grown for drug testing in vitro and injected into mice for in 
vivo tumor formation. This will be an important correlative study to continue  to use in 
comparison to clinical response in patients .

Analysis of OncInsight’s Drug Prediction Compared to Empi[INVESTIGATOR_59330] -N-
AS and SH -SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cell Lines  
Total RNA preparations from each of SK -N-AS and SH -SY5Y from [CONTACT_59646]’s laboratory were 
analyzed using Affymetrix’s HG -U133 Plus 2 platform.  Raw MAS5 data was converted using 
Intervention Insight’s whole body expression data, a collection of [ADDRESS_64538]. Khan’s  laboratory supplied Intervention Insights with CEL file data 
from Affymetrix’s HG -U133 Plus 2 platform generated in their laboratory to be used as a 
comparator of cross -laboratory expression data.  An Intervention Insights, OncInsights report of 
predicted drugs was prepared exactly as described elsewhere in the protocol.  
 
Fifty -six compounds were tested at high and low concentrations in a cell growth assay for each of 
SK-N-AS and SH -SY5Y (determined as percent growth at [ADDRESS_64539] drug treatment) [51].  Of 
the fifty -six compounds tested, the OncInsights system could select up to eighteen drugs.  Of the 
eighteen drugs selectable, nine were selected (50%, selected either as sensitive or insensitive).  
Seven drugs were selected in the analysis of SK -N-AS and nine drugs were selected in the 
analysis of SH -SY5Y.  Thirty two overlaps were comparable [SK -N-AS high concentration (7); 
SK-N-AS low concentration (7); SH -SY5Y high concentration (9) and SH -SY5Y low 
concentration (9)]. For SK -N-AS, 79% agreement was observed and 21% disagreement was 
observed.  For SH -SY5Y, 61% agreement was observed and 39% disagreement was observed.  
Combined, OncInsights accurately predicted growth sensitivities for SK -N-AS and SH -SY5Y 
63% of the time.  
 
Analysis of OncInsight’s Drug Prediction Compared to PPTP drug sensitivity.  
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has established the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program 
(PPTP) for testing drugs against in vitro and in vivo childhood cancer models to aid in the 
prioritization of drugs considered for early phase pediatric clinical trials. Drugs tested in xenograft models and predicted to be effective were evaluated using the OncInsights report as a 
comparison.  
 
AZD2171 Response in Rhabdoid Kidney Tumor  
FGFR2 overexpression has been identified to affect a variety of bone, skin and cancer

xenograft KT -16 was analyzed using Affymetrix’s HG -U133 Plus 2 platform and converted using 
Intervention Insight’s whole body expression data.   The OncInsights platform using the Drug 
Target Expression Method identified AZD2171 as a potential therapeutic option, based on the overexpression of FGFR2 (Z=3.978) from this mouse xenograft.

Dasatinib Response in B -Cell ALL  
Several recent papers have demonstrated the effectiveness of dasatinib in the treatment of patients 
with ALL [53-55] . In this PPTP mouse xenograft of B -cell ALL (ALL- 4), treatment with 
dasatinib resulted in a complete response. The mRNA from the xenograft  ALL -4 was analyzed 
using Affymetrix’s HG -U133 Plus 2 platform and converted using Intervention Insight’s whole 
body expression data.   The OncInsights platform showed that three of the seven targets of dasatinib were found to be activated in this tumor using the network- based Transcription Factor 
Activity Method.

 Neuroblastoma Gene Target Analysis Platform Reproducibility  
Activities  
Five core needle biopsies were processed for the reproducibility study: MGT 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. 
One of these, MGT 4, was subsequently found to be a neuroendocrine carcinoma . Since five such 
samples are required, completion of the reproducibility study requires one additional patient.  
Back ground and 
Goal The Neuroblastoma 
Gene Target Analysis 
Platform (IDE # G100111) includes a 
process that, based on 
core needle biopsies of a neuroblastoma solid tumor, provides 
genome- wide expression profiles, 
comparative gene expression profiles based 
on a reference collection of normal tissues, 
and a set of drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], each of which 
has a score (Figure 1). We proposed to study reproducibility of the IDE by [CONTACT_59519]. The primary goal of the reproducibility study is to evaluate the variation among sets of drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59334]. Secondary 
goals are 1) to compare the variation among sets of drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59335] 2) to evaluate variation associated with earlier steps in the process, in particular, expression profiles and 
comparative expression profiles (Figure 1).  
Design  
The design employed (Figure 2) was a hierarchical component that allows us to quantify variation within biopsies and to evaluate it 
within the context of the variation between biopsies as well as a cross -classification by [CONTACT_59520].  
Methods  
Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide array technology is used to obtain gene expression profiles, 
�Eg|g∈G�, where G is the set of probe sets on the GeneChip. The OncInsights service calculates 
comparative expression profiles, �Zg�, from the sample mean and sample standard deviation, 
��E�gR, sgR��, of a Reference collection of normal tissue expression profiles using Zg=Eg−E�gR
sgR.  
The OncInsights service uses comparative expression profiles to obtain a set of drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
Dpr, for each patient, p, and replicate biopsy, r, as well as scores, �Sprd�, for each drug, d in Dpr. 
The reproducibility of the identification of a drug, d∈Dpr, is defined as the proportion of other 
drug sets associated with the same patient that identify the drug   
Figure 2. Reproducibility study design. Triplicate 
patient biopsies allow us to  quantify variation 
within biopsies and to evaluate it in the context of 
the variation between biopsies . Each of the three 
biopsy sections is  processed to obtain cDNA. cDNA 
samples are split and processed in two batches, 
allowing us to evaluate variation associated with 
processing batch.

where H i s an indicator function that equals 1 when its argument is true and 0 otherwise, Rp is the 
set of replicates, and �Rp� is the size of Rp (3, the number of replicates). Fdpr= [ADDRESS_64550]= [ADDRESS_64551]. We 
consider the average reproducibility associated with each patient, F�p, that is, the average of Fprd 
over replicates and drugs,

a minimum score

We note that a method that uniformly identifies every drug would not be an acceptable method 
yet would exhibit perfect reproducibility. We therefore evaluate the variation among drug lists associated with the same patient in the context of the variation among drug lists from different patients. Methods developed by [CONTACT_59521], Anderson, and their coworkers [ 56-58] and the Jaccard 
distance allow us to use the framework familiar from univariate ANOVA. More precisely, these methods allow us to test the null hypothesis that the variation among sets lists associated with different patients can be accounted for by [CONTACT_59522].

 Results  
Expression profiles  
Distance- based nonparametric multi variate 
analysis of variance [ 57, 58] allowed us to reject the null hypothesis that variation between 
biopsies can be accounted for by [CONTACT_59523] (p=0.001). That the variation 
among expression profiles associated with the same biopsy is small compared with the variation between expression profiles associated with different biopsies is apparent from Principal 
Component Analysis (Figure 3).  
 
Sets of drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59336], the variation among drug sets associated with the same biopsy is small compared with 
the variation among drug lists associated with different biopsies (p=0.001). The reproducibility 
averaged over patients, replicates, and drugs is 0.68.  As the threshold score increases the reproducibility increases to 1 (Figure 4).  
 Conclusion  
Collectively, the early preclinical and current  clinical data suggests that this integrated approach 
is highly feasible  and safe in neuroblastoma and that it is reproducible among repeat samples 
within patients.  It is also clear that an investigation of this approach in other targeted patient 
populations is warranted. Brain tumors, and rare solid tumors are logical diseases in which to evaluate this approach, based upon the analogous need to develop a more rational -based approach 
to therapeutic selection in these difficult to treat tumors. Furthermore, the ongoing collaborative efforts between the co -investigators of this proposal in identifying novel molecular -based 
treatments for pediatric cancers  and provides further justification to develop this analysis further 
to include DNA mutation analysis in tumor board decision making.

 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objectives  
Determine feasibility of using tumor samples to assess genomic mRNA expression  arrays and 
DNA mutation panel s using predictive modeling to make real -time treatment decisions  for 
children with relapsed/refractory cancers . 
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
♦ To continue to determine the safety of allowing a molecular tumor board to determine 
individualized treatment plans   
♦ To determine the activity of treatments chosen based on:  
• Overall response rate (ORR)  
• Progression free survival (PFS)

♦ To compare PFS interval to PFS intervals of previous chemotherapy regimens since 
relapse for each subject . 
[ADDRESS_64553] s will undergo a scheduled surgical resection and/or diagnostic biopsy procedure. 
Common sample identifiers will be provided by [CONTACT_59525] s ample, data and 
report alignment between participating organizations.  At the time of tissue resection or biopsy, two fresh tumor sample s will be committed for this specific research study (referred to as 
“Primary Sample s”), and prepared immediately per Appendix II and section 9.3. Primary 
Samples will be sen t to Clinical Reference Laboratory (CRL) and Spectrum Health Molecular 
Diagnostics . Samples will be review ed by [CONTACT_59526] >75% tumor and >75% 
tumor cell viability which is required for microarray analysis . In the absence of an adequate 
tumor specimen from the enrolled subject, this would represent a non- feasible outcome for this 
subject on the study.  Tumor samples will also be sent for research purposes (referred to as 
“Secondary Samples.”) A portion of the tumor tissue biopsy will be shipped overnight to  the 
Neuroblastoma Translational Research Laboratory  on dry ice.  
Upon arrival of the tumor specimens at the Clinical Reference Laboratory (CRL), Spectrum 
Health,  the Neuroblastoma Translational Research Laboratory , and TGen, the samples will 
be logged and immediately processed according to details in Section 9.  
Clinical Protocol. NMTRC [ADDRESS_64554] RNA isolated and amplified for hybridization to an Affymetrix 
U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip®. This step will be performed by [CONTACT_59527] (CLIA certified lab) in Lenexa, KS. The 
RNA extraction, amplification, hybridization, and scanning procedures adhere to strict standard 
operating procedures to ensure that results are highly accurate and reproducible. The operation 
includes stringent controls over quality including measurements of RNA quality to minimize the 
chance that inaccurate data will be utilized in the study. By [CONTACT_15094], a failure in an individual step 
will result in a re -run of that specific step if suitable material remains. A second failure will result 
in exclusion of the subject  from the study unless an additional fresh surgical specimen can be 
obtained. Standard metrics include the 260/280 ratio and the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_59337]) which provides a measure RNA degradation as an RNA integrity number (RIN). To pass 
QC, the 260/[ADDRESS_64555] has already started protocol trea tment, this information will be 
communicated to the treating site Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_59338] a mutual decision about continued treatment will be made . 
3.3 DNA Mutation Panel  
 Ion Torrent Deep Amplicon Sequencing of Tumor Samples : Deoxyribonucleic acid will be 
extracted from tumor tissues and quantitated using the Qubit2 fluorometer (Invitrogen). Ten 
nanograms of DNA will be used for multiplex PCR of a panel covering 739 mutations in 46 
cancer -related genes (Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel, Life Technologies). Subsequent processing of 
samples will be performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Library constructions of the 
amplicons and subsequent enrichment of the sequencing beads will be performed using the 
OneTouch system. Sequencing will be done on the 314 chip with 10 megabases capacity using 
the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (Life Technologies) as per the manufacturer’s 
protocol. Data analysis, including alignment to the hg19 human reference genome and base 
calling, is done using built -in software.  De-identified Data will be sent to the NMTRC via secure 
e-mail for creation of the DNA Mutation Panel Drug Prediction Report.  
3.[ADDRESS_64556]  will be assigned a unique anonymous identifier by [CONTACT_59528]  (NMTRC ), which will 
be used to track the “Subject” derived “Samples” and performed “Experiments”.  At each entity 
level, pertinent data can be associated; for example, primary and secondary clinical endpoints can ultimately be associated with the Subject and the  histopathological assessment of the donated 
Sample, and experimental parameters with each Experiment.   For the proposed work it should be 
adequate to exchange sample information in tables that provide for easy identification of the 
subject  identifier.  In addition, the normalized Affymetrix GeneChip data will be associated with 
the Experiment for further analysis as described below.  Upon exchange of the normalized 
GeneChip data and all associated experimental parameters, an additional QC check will be

While quality control parameters are checked  by [CONTACT_59529], a secondary 
assessment provides an additional level of quality assurance.  If no failures are noted upon this 
review, a complete analysis of the molecular data will proceed.  
 
3.4.1  Intervention Insights OncInsights mRNA Expression Service  
 
The following describes the Intervention Insights OncInsights service which utilizes data 
generated from the RNA Microarray analysis (as described in section 3.2 above).  
 A consistent step for the OncInsights methodologies outlined in this proposal is the conversion of 
normalized probe set intensities to a relative measure of transcript abundance.  While many 
studies use an arbitrary fold change threshold relative to a reference sample as a means to 
determine significant changes in gene expression, we prefer to utilize a standardized z- score 
method (described below in Signal Pre -Preprocessing and Z -Score Calculation ) to determine 
statistically significant differences in each neuroblastoma sample relative to a whole body 
reference.  This method assigns a z -score to each probe set based upon the number of standard 
deviations from the normal sample population mean.  This provides a good assessment of 
transcript “ differences ” relative to a whole body reference set which may not necessarily be 
associated with large fold changes in transcript expression. Having established a consistent data input of relative transcript abundance in each subject s tumor specimen, the following  analytical 
methods will be applied to the standardized data to predict drug efficacy.  
 
Predicted Therapeutic Compounds:  At this time, there are currently greater than [ADDRESS_64557] Online and MedTrack.  
 Whole Body Reference Set:  A whole body bank of forty- five normal tissue gene expression 
levels are used as the reference set for the normalization calculations.  A whole body reference was chosen to provide a wider variance of tissue specific gene expression for comparison in order to best identify expression differences from tumor tissue.  The reference also helps to decrease 
toxicity risk by [CONTACT_59530].  
 
Signal Pre -Processing, Z-Score Calculation  and Sibling Probeset Logic  
Signal Pre -Processing.   Signal data from the Affymetrix U133 2.0 Plus  GeneChip is normalized 
using Affymetrix’s MAS5.0 Normalization Algorithm.  Using Affymetrix Annotation version 32 (released August 2011), probesets which map to more than one gene (potential cross -hybridizing) 
are removed from the analysis.  Probesets marked “present” by [CONTACT_11072] P/M/A algorithm are 
included in the OncInsights method calculations.  In addition and to include down regulated 
genes, probesets marked “absent” or “marginal” are included in the OncInsights method based on the following logic:  probesets with a tumor signal value less than the mean reference signal value 
and the reference probeset is marked “present” by [CONTACT_11072] P/M/A logic 50% or more of the 
Clinical Protocol. NMTRC [ADDRESS_64558] deviation as follows: 
 
 
 
Where x is the signal intensity, µ is the mean probeset intensity from the reference standard and σ 
is the standard deviation of the mean of the referenc e.  Interpretation of the z -score is 
straightforward and has no special case.  Positive z -scores represent the number of standard 
deviations that the observation being evaluated is above the mean; conversely negative z -scores 
represent the number of standard deviations below the mean.  Observations with high, positive z -
scores are said to be “up -regulated” or “over -expressed” whereas observations with low, negative 
z-scores are said to be “down -regulated” or “under -expressed”.  Finally, it is important to note 
that the z -score represents the individual z -score relative to the same probeset in the normal 
reference group and not its z -score among all other probesets within the total expression data . 
 
Sibling Probeset Logic.  Within the Affymetric Annotation file, numerous probesets map to the 
same Entrez Gene, these probesets are called siblings.  To merge multiple probeset measurements 
(converted to Z -score), the OncInsights systems using an industry accepted logic as follows:  
 
A probeset maps to a single Entrez Gene, the z- score value is assigned to the Entrez Gene.  
 Two probesets map to a single Entrez Gene, the maximum observed z -score value is assigned 
to the Entrez Gene.  
 Three or more probesets map to a single gene, the median observed z -score vaule is assigned 
to the Entrex Gene,  
 Upon conclusion of these methods, the OncInsights system has a list of genes with their associated z- score value.  These genes and their measured z- score values are used in all 
subsequent OncInsights methods except the Drug Response Signatures Algorithm which uses only probeset values as described below.  
 BioMarker Based Rules (Sensitive and Insensitive Rules)  
The method employs predefined and published rules maintained in the drug knowledgebase in which a drug effect has been associated with an expression of a genomic marker.  This method not only predicts drugs which would be suited to treat a specific condition (sensitive), it also flags 
drugs which are predicted to be insensitive given a subject ’s tumor biomarker expression 
(insensitive).   Genes with z- score values within the rule range (positive or negative z -score 
values) trigger display of the therapeutic compound.  As an example, one rule within the BioMarker Based Algorithm refers to AR, androgen receptor, and bicalutamide.  When tumor AR 
z-score is ≥ +3.0 (three standard deviations above the reference mean) the rule is trigger and 
bicalutamide is included in the OncInsights report.  This is an example of a therapeutic compound that is “sensitive” when “over- expressed”.  Other rules trigger “sensitive” when “under -
expressed” as when tumor ERCC1, excision repair cross -complementing repair deficiency, z-
score ≤ -3.0 (three standard deviations below the reference mean) triggers carboplatin as xzµ
σ−=

 “sensitive”.  While simple and practical in nature, one concern with this methodology is that 
over-expression of a drug target can represent a means by [CONTACT_59531] a 
targeted agent [35].  In addition, BioMarker Based Rules can trigger “insensitive” when gene 
expression is “over -expressed” or “under -expressed”.  Currently there are [ADDRESS_64559] two or more publically available sources in which the therapeutic agent (drug) has an 
effect on the gene target.  
 
Drug Target Expression Algorithm  
Genes with z- scores ≥ +3 (three standard deviations above the reference mean) are submitted to 
the method and therapeutic compounds which meet the rule requirement are selected and 
displayed in the OncInsights report.  This is analogous to the current approaches of detecting 
Her2 and Egfr gene amplification or over -expression prior to treatment with the appropriate 
targeted inhibitors [ 59, 60]. For this approach, we utilize public domain knowledge of the existing 
pharmacopeia and their molecular mechanisms of action [ 38, 39].  For example, one rule within 
the Drug Target Expression Algorithm refers to ESR1 , estrogen receptor 1 , and tamoxifen .  When 
tumor ESR1  z-score expression is ≥ +3.[ADDRESS_64560] two or more publically available sources in which the therapeutic agent (drug) has an inhibitory effect on the gene target . 
 
Network Target Activity (Systems Biology Method, GeneGo)  
A major consideration for the future of predictive therapeutics is the identification of active (or 
inactive) molecular networks within a tumor to permit network -directed therapeutic strategies 
[28, 30, 61].  In partnership with GeneGo  (www.genego.com) , we have developed a systems 
wide biology method based upon network topology for predicting drug target status and 
contribution within tumor -specific networks [ 62].  The method looks at biological pathways by 
[CONTACT_2164] a shortest path network within a list of the subject ’s genes which are above a 
predefined threshold (z -score ≥ +2).  Using these genes, a global network representing known 
geneomic pathways is constructed using knowledge contained in GeneGo’s master database of publically available, peer -reviewed literature describing protein -protein interactions.  These two 
networks are then compared to determine which genes may represent significant pathways with 
respect to the subject ’s tumor biology.  Genes are “scored” using the comparison of the two 
networks.  The method is designed to uncover regulatory proteins (kinases, transcription factors) 
which may not be affected at the differential gene expression level, but drive down stream 
transcription activity through transcription factors.  Statistically, this method evaluates the 
enrichment in transcriptional targets compared to the global protein network and evaluates 
whether there is a higher proportion of possible transcriptional targets in the gene set of interest 
than would be expected in a random collection of genes.  This algorithm yields a robust analysis 
of tertiary expression of targets and downstream effects of regulation.  
 Drug Response Signatures Algorithm (Connectivity Map)  
The method uses a publically available data set called The Connectivity Map developed at the Broad Institute [ 43, 48] and recently commercialized by [CONTACT_59532].  In the original 
description of the method, Lamb et al were able to successfully predict cell lines that were 
responsive to estrogen receptor inhibitors [ 43].  Subsequently, the general approach has been 
applied to several datasets to hypothesize potential drug efficacy in the background of different 
disease contexts [ 42, 49].  It was developed to elicit gene expression signatures from human cells 
associated with drug exposure to identify a functional (disease state) connection.  The top 500 
Clinical Protocol. NMTRC 008  
 
Version 2.0 Final  Page 37 of 268 Confidential  
Issued 12 June 2013  
 genes ranked by z -score with a z- score ≥ 1.5 and the bottom 500 genes ranked by z -score with a 
z-score ≤ -1.5 are submitted to the OncInsights Drug Response Signature [CONTACT_59637].  The 
connectivity score is calculated from a nonparametric, rank -based pattern -matching strategy 
based on the Kolmogorov- Smirnov statistic with p -values estim ated by [CONTACT_59533] 
(n=5 0,000 tests) as described previously [ 63, 64].  Upon completion of the analysis, drugs with p-
values ≥ 0.05 (negative enrichment scores) are included in the report.  A negative enrichment 
score implies that genes that are down -regulated by [CONTACT_59534]- regulated in the tumor sample 
and vice versa.  The implication is that the drug reverses the gene expression changes associated 
with the disease and thus may act to reverse the disease.  
 
Drug Sensitivity Signatures Algorithm (PGSEA)  
The Drug Sensitivity Signatures algorithm reproduces the published implementation of the Parametric Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (PGSEA) using the NCI -60 cell line sensitivity 
signatures [44, 45].  A PGSEA drug signature [CONTACT_59638] -expressed genes (determined pre -drug 
treatment) to drug sensitivity as measured by [CONTACT_59535] (IC50) of 
the cell line studied.  The drug signature [CONTACT_832] a collection of Entrez Gene IDs that were found to be 
over-expressed in drug sensitive cells.  Based on this evidence, if a tumor’s gene signature [CONTACT_59639]-expression is similar to a sensitive cell’s gene signature [CONTACT_59640] -expression the drug may 
also be effective for the tumor cells.  To evaluate potential sensitivity to a signature, a one sample 
t-test is applied to evaluate if the mean of the z -score values is significantly greater than zero.  
The analysis only tests for a difference in the positive z -score direction.  A negative z- score trend 
even if it is significant is discarded.  This approach is consistent with well published methods for inferring drug sensitivity utilizing the NCI 60 cell line dataset [45, 51].

3.4.2  DNA Mutation Panel Analysis  
 The following describes  a process  which utilizes data generated from the DNA Mutation 
Panel analysis (as described in section 3. 3 above).

The data from the Spectrum Health Ion Torrent Cancer Panel will be provided to the NMTRC .. A 
knowledge database created from published research literature linking mutations with targeted 
drugs  in cancers will provide a report for the tumor board showing the mutations and predicted 
therapeutics from the list provided in Appendix III.  
 
An in -house software application is implemented that produces reproducible, rules -based lists 
linking gene mutations with potential drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. An electronic rule -capture interface is used 
to import a spreadsheet database, that contains genes, measurement types, and  values for those 
measurements, and any other additional columns.  Rules (for each gene) are assigned to the 
application by [CONTACT_473], without  modifying the core software code. All conditions  follow 
the basic form "<measurement> <verb> <value>". These verbs include <, <=, >, >=,  equals, is 
present, is not present. Every rule may have any number of modifiers that effectively serve as sub-rules that  associate  the rule with  other potential drug treatment for the parent rule.

 Report:  
The process of report generation begins with gene specific input with accompanying aberration 
data. If gene matches gene in the database then aberration is checked. This will generate a rule in 
table -format stating a direct relationship, indicate/do not indicate drug. If an aberration is not 
exactly matched it will trigger an inferred relationship, indicate/do not indicate  drug.  The 
generated report includes a PubMed ID for each rule, which will be included as both 
supplementary data and an outbound hyperlink. The software enables only authorized 
investigators to access the underlying system configuration. Users of this application are able to 
access the data only through the GUI "front -end", thereby [CONTACT_59536]. This software takes into account the following:  
1. 100% reproducible output given the same input.   
2. Simple yet sophisticated rules management.   
3. Cross reference data with several open source data sets.  
4. Generation of a clinically understandable, actionable report.  
 Positive mutation findings from the Ion Torrent Panel will be verified using Sanger Sequencing. 
While all attempts will be made to have this data available to the tumor board, due to the potential 
length of time to process Sanger Sequencing samples, these results may not be available until 
after the tumor board has met and the patient has started protocol treatment. If Sanger Sequencing 
results differ from Ion Torrent results and the subject has already started protocol treatment, this information will be communicated to the treating site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_59339] a mutual decision about continued treatment will 
be made.

Map, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis , or DNA mutation panel ). For the se panel s the 
analytical methods are independently applied to the standardized and normalized (relative to whole body reference set) gene expression data derived from the profiling of each 
subject ’s tumor. Each method is associated with an objective statistical threshold that 
must be exceeded in order for a specific drug to be predicted and reported for 
consideration. Multiple lines of evidence (e.g. multiple methods predicting the same 
drug, multiple targets for the same drug) will be considered during the review process. 
Clinical Protocol. NMTRC [ADDRESS_64562] and safe dosing schedules (s ee 
drug dosing below Section 3.5 .1.2). Those without known pediatric dosing will be 
excluded.  
3. Potential drug choices will be analyzed with regards to safety, mechanism, availability 
and cost. Focus will be on low -toxicity, targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
4. Drug combinations will be allowed, up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_64563]’s routine medications and supplements. F or drug interactions and known 
toxicities the following databases will be used: MicroMedex LexiComp, E -facts, Natural 
Medicines Database.  
Subject s’ history and previously received treatments will be reviewed. Drugs which a subject  
has failed will be given low priority and used only if there is a rationale for synergy in 
combination therapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recommended priorities for determining drug dosing to be used in 
individualized treatment plans include the following:  
1. For a given proposed individualized combination of drugs the first priority to establish doses will be to identify the same combination of drugs in a peer -reviewed journal article 
or presented as a reviewed abstract, or which is part of an ongoing peer -reviewed clinical 
trial registered with clinical trials.gov.  
2. When a proposed individualized combination of drugs has not previously been reported, 
the process to establish doses will be to then identify individual members of the proposed 
combination that have been used in combination with other cytotoxic agents similar to 
those being considered for combination therapy. The source of information will be a 
peer-reviewed journal article or presented as a reviewed abstract, or which is part of an 
ongoing peer -reviewed clinical trial registered with clinical trials.gov.  
3. When a proposed individualized combination of drugs have no available combination data, dosing guidelines will start with the MTD determined from a phase I/II pediatric 
study.  Reference information will be based upon either a peer -reviewed journal article or 
presented as a reviewed abstract, or which is part of an ongoing peer -reviewed clinical 
trial registered with clinical trials.gov.  Doses will be reduced to compensate for potential 
additive toxicities of combination agent s (refer to protocol section 3.5 .1.1 #5 that 
describes pharmacy  programs that are used to evaluate potential interactions and 
combination dosing for all medications).  
Please note that many of the drugs that will be considered for proposed individualized combination therapy in this protocol are not considered cytotoxic agents and therefore will not 
have previously been specifically tested as part of conventional antineoplastic protocols.

7.3 Response Criteria  
Overall response rate (ORR) in subject s with radiologically assessable disease will be determined 
by [CONTACT_59548] -sectional imaging, MIBG /PET  scans, and/or bone marrow assessment.  
Response Assessment:  Each subject will be classified according to their “best response” for the 
purposes of analysis of treatment effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
objective statuses described below.  
Response Criteria for Subjects with Solid Tumors : This study will use the (RECIST) 
Response Evaluation Criteria measurements in Solid Tumor from the NCI (Therasse, et al, 2000) modified for pediatrics.  
• Measurable disease:  The presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension with the longest diameter at least 10 mm  
• Serial measurements of lesions are to be done with CT or MRI, using the same method of assessment is to be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
• Quantification of Disease Burden The sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions 
will be calculated and reported as the disease measurement.  For this evaluation, all scans will 
undergo central review.  
 
 
   
 
Version 2.0 Final  Page 50 of 268  Confidential  
Issued 12 June 2013  
 • Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  
• Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the disease measurement, taking as 
reference the disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease at study entry.  
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR or sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD from study entry.  
• Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of all 
target lesions compared to study entry, the appearance of unequivocal new lesions, or 
laboratory evidence of clinical progression (e.g., spread to bone marrow or increasing 
catecholamines).  
 
Response Criteria for Subject s with Bone Marrow Disease:  
• Those subject s with morphologic evidence of neuroblastoma by [CONTACT_59549] H and E staining 
(NSE staining only is not evaluable) will be evaluable to assess bone marrow response.  
• Complete response: No tumor cells detectable by [CONTACT_59550][INVESTIGATOR_59345].  
• Progressive disease: Tumor seen on morphology on two consecutive bone marrows done at least three weeks apart in subject s who had NO tumor in bone marrow at study entry. (Note: 
Subject  may be declared as progressive disease in bone marrow after only one diagnostic bone 
marrow at the discretion of the treating physician after discussion with the study chair.)  
• Stable disease : Persistence of an amount of tumor in the bone marrow by [CONTACT_59551].  
 
 
Response Criteria for Subject s with MIBG or PET  Positive Lesions  
• Subject s who have a positive MIBG or PET scan at the start of therapy will be evaluable for 
MIBG or PET  response. All MIBG’s  and PET scans  will be performed at the research 
institution and then centrally reviewed.  
• Complete response = complete resolution of all positive lesions  
• Partial response = resolution of at least one positive lesion, with persistence of other MIBG 
positive lesions.  
• Stable disease = no change in scan in number of positive lesions (includes subject s who have 
same number of positive lesions but decreased intensity)  
• Progressive disease = Development of new positive lesions  
 
Duration of response : 
Duration of response is defined as the period of time from when measurement criteria are met for 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), whichever is first recorded, until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented (taking as reference for PD 
the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The assessment of response will include the initial measurable targets and will be performed after 
the first and second cycle, then after every other cycle (or [ADDRESS_64584]). Serial 
results of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], biopsies and urinary catecholamines will be reviewed for responding subject s to confirm response or lack of progression.   
 
Clinical Response  
A subject will be defined as having a clinical response if they have stable disease or better and  a 
decrease in their tumor markers by ≥ 50%. Clinical response will also be defined as a subject that 
has a complete clearing of a previously positive bone marrow while on study.  
   
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_64585] day of administration of study drug until 
the criteria for progression are met taking as reference the screening measurements, will be assessed.   
8 Sample Size Justification  
 
Feasibility  
Since this is primarily a feasibility trial, the definition of feasibility for this study will include:  
 
“Enrollment onto study, RNA expression profile completed, DNA Mutation Panel 
completed, genomic analysis and report generation, tumor board held with treatment decision, treatment review completed and start of treatment by [ADDRESS_64586] biopsy/surgical 
resection date, and then completion of 1 cycle of therapy.”  
 
Our preliminary results for [ADDRESS_64587] a sample collection success rate of 
5/5 (100%) subject s, a genetic report profile success rate of 5/5 (100%) within the 7- 10 day time 
window as well as a treatment agreement success rate of 5/5 (100%) within the 5 day time window.  The average time (+/ -SD) for completion of the genetic profile was 6.6 days (+/ -1.7 
days) with a median of 7 days.   The average time (+/ -SD) for time to Treatment was 3.2 days (+/ -
0.8 days) with a median of 3 days.   Data preliminary to date for each of these three feasibility 
markers are very consistent with our anticipated performance standards.   
  
Our initial feasibility trial continues to show that it is feasible and safe to use RNA expression 
analysis for tumor boards creating treatment decisions for patients without curative options. This 
study will ask the feasibility of adding a DNA mutation panel and expansion to other non-curative pediatric cancers as well.  
  Assumptions :  The feasibility o utcome is a binary measure for each of the three clinical strata 
with a lower success null value of 50% which would require reconsideration of the full process and an upper success value of 75% for the alternative which would be deemed worthy of further consideration for an efficacy trial at the next phase. A binomial distribution was used for the 
testing process with a combination of Type I error levels (10%) and Power (75 %).  The  basic 
design overall is a MiniM ax approach which minimizes the overall sample size. The MiniMax 
design with an interim look will require an overall sample size of n = 16 .  Each of the three 
clinical strata will use a two stage decision rule.  
 
The Two -Stage Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_59346]:  
 Stage 1: Stop and accept the null hypothesis if the observed feasibility rate is less than or equal to 
5/9.  Otherwise, continue to stage 2.  
 
The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10036] 0. 746 when Ho is true and 0.166 when Ha is true.  
 
Stage 2: Stop and accept the null hypothesis if the observed feasibility rate is less than or equal to 10/16.  Otherwise, stop and reject the null hypothesis.

Version 2.[ADDRESS_64588]  Samples:  
 
At screening, subject s will have biopsy samples sent. The main sample for study report will be 
referred to as the “Primary Sample.”  
 The “Primary Sample” will be a current solid tumor biopsy or core bone marrow biopsy  (with 
>75% tumor) . 
 
If a solid tumor sample cannot be obtained and the subject ’s bone marrow is <75%  tumor then 
they will be ineligible for study.  
 In addition to the “Primary Sample”, if subject s have signed the additional consent for optional 
sample collection, they will also have these secondary samples sent as follows.

 9.4 Correlative Biology Studies  
 
At the Neuroblastoma Translational Research Laboratory  tumor cells (from either biopsy 
or bone marrow samples) will be grown to 70% confluency in neurobasal media with 
EGF and FGF. Cell lines will be maintained in culture for these and future biology 
studies. These will include studies such as determining the growth curves and 
responsiveness of cells derived from these tumors to a variety of agents identified on the report in vitro (both the chosen regimen as well as alternate options). Cells will be 
injected into the inguinal fat pad of NOD SCID mice for generation of subject xenografts. 
These mice will be used for correlative drug testing experiments based on predictive 
models. Evaluation of mechanism of action of new drug combinations will be evaluated 
in mice models through immunohistochemical staining, western blotting, and RNA 
expression profiling of tumor preps. These models will allow us the opportunity validate 
predictive modeling in a laboratory model.  
 . 
 Samples will be sent to the Translational Genomics Institute (TGen) for DNA and RNA 
sequencing. Isolation of DNA and RNA from subject samples will be performed for use 
in genomic studies. Nucleic acids will be extracted from blood, bone Marrow or tumor 
tissues.  Analysis for mutations or Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) in tumors, using 
germ line DNA as control, will be conducted using blood and fresh or frozen tumor tissue.  Comparative Genomics Hybridization, whole genome sequencing of tumor and 
germline DNA, messenger RNA sequencing and expression analysis and epi[INVESTIGATOR_59356].  
 
Bone marrow samples will also be sent to Spectrum Health to be sorted by [CONTACT_59553][INVESTIGATOR_59347]- color, ganglioside GD2, analysis using 
monoclonal antibodies to membrane antigen expression of ganglioside GD2FITC dye, 
CD81FITCdye, the absence of CD45PerCPdyeleukocytic antigen, and the presence of 
CD56APC NCAM antigen, CD9, and/or CD34.  Cells or tumor samples will have RNA 
isolated and run on an Affymetrix U133+ Array chip. Data will be analyzed for 
comparison of bone marrow tumor and solid tumor expression profiles.  
9.5 Storage  
 
Blood and tumor samples collected for any studies performed in this protocol, and any 
other components from the processed cells, may be stored indefinitely  to research 
scientific questions related to cancer and/or study drugs. The subject retains the right to 
have the sample material destroyed at any time by [CONTACT_59554].  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_64606] , the 
NMTRC  research coordinator will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (via e- mail). If a spot is available at the time, the 
potential subject  will undergo consent and completion of all required screening procedures and 
certification of all inclusion and exclusion criteria by [CONTACT_737].  If the subject  fits all 
enrollment criteria, the site will again contact [CONTACT_59555], Spectrum Health, Neuroblastoma Translational Research 
Laboratory , TGen , and Intervention Insights in preparation for collection and processing of tissue 
sample. The research coordinator at NMTRC  will organize the convening of members of the 
tumor board for discussion of the current case once the full report is available. In addition, a study 
enrollment form will be faxed to the coordinator at  NMTRC , a unique subject  identifier will be 
assigned and the enrollment form will be sent back to the participating site. The NMTRC  will 
contact [CONTACT_59556] e -mail if the study enrollment is on hold or closed at any time.  
 Subject  samples will be collected at each institution and follow the flow chart above.  Once the 
report s are generated they will be sent to NMTRC/ [CONTACT_59647].  The Principal Investigator

unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
An untoward medical event which occurs outside the period of follow -up as defined in the 
protocol will not be considered an adverse event unless related to study drug.  Worsening of a medical condition for which the efficacy of the study drug is being evaluated will not be 
considered an adverse event.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_64608] medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)  
• Requires in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity   
• Results in  a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59358].  Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of an event; the event itself 
may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache).  This is not the same 
as “serious”, which is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject ’s life or functioning.    
10.1.[ADDRESS_64609] , physical examination and review of laboratory results.   
 All adverse events, whether serious or not, will be described in the source documents and Grade 2 
or higher (per CTCAE 4.0) adverse events that occur while on study should be captured on the 
adverse event case report form.  All Baseline AE’s will be captured on a separate baseline Adverse event case report form. All Grade [ADDRESS_64610] be captured.  
 
Information to be reported in the description of each adverse event includes:  
• A medical diagnosis of the event (if a medical diagnosis cannot be determined, a description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event should be recorded)  
• The date of onset of the event and relatedness to treatment regimen.  
• The date of resolution of the event and whether the event is serious or not  
• Action taken; drug treatment required; non- drug treatment required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59359]; diagnostic procedure performed; subject

 10.1.5  Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All fatal or life –threatening adverse events must be reported to the NMTRC  immediately by 
[CONTACT_756], fax, or e -mail within 24 hours  of knowledge of the event. If full information is not 
known, additional follow -up by [CONTACT_59558].  
 
All other serious adverse events that are unexpected (not listed in the relevant appendices) which 
occur any time  after the subject has been consented up to [ADDRESS_64612] be reported to the study chair  
and appropriate regulatory authorities (local IRB and FDA if required)  within 7 days of 
notification of the event . 
 All Grade 3 and 4 (CTCAE), events that are not in the relevant appendices and that are possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to the research, but are not included in the SAE category above 
should also be reported to the study chair and appropriate regulatory authorities within [ADDRESS_64613] be followed until resolution or stabilization.   Unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, serious 
adverse events related to participation in the study, and all volunteer deaths related to 
participation in the study should be promptly reported to the NMTRC . 
 
 
10.1.6  Grading and Relatedness of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Grading of Severity of an Adverse Event  
Each adverse event (Grade 2 or higher) will be graded for severity per the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V 4.0), and these criteria must be used in grading the severity of adverse events.  The criteria can be found at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
. 
 Grading of Severity of an Adverse Event Not Listed in Published Criteria:  
For those adverse events which are not listed as part of the NCI CTCAE V 4 .0, the same grading 
system should be used, where:  
• Mild corresponds to an event not resulting in disability or incapacity and which resolves 
without intervention  
• Moderate corresponds to an event not resulting in disability or incapacity but which 
requires intervention  
• Severe corresponds to an event resulting in temporary disability or incapacity and which 
requires intervention  
• Life-threatening  corresponds to an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the 
time of the event  
• Fatal  corresponds to an event that results in the death of the subject  
 
   
 
Version 2.0 Final  Page 63 of 268 Confidential  
Issued 12 June 2013  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Relatedness to Study Drug  
The Investigator must attempt to determine if an adverse event is in some way related to the use 
of the study drug and define an attribution category. This relationship should be described as 
follows:  
 
RELATIONSHIP  ATTRIBUTION  DESCRIPTION  
Unrelated to 
investigational 
agent/intervention  
 Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT related to the 
intervention.  
The event is clearly due to causes distinct from the use of 
the study drug, such as a documented pre -existing 
condition, the effect of a concomitant medication, or a new 
condition which, based on the pathophysiology of the condition, and the pharmacology of the study drug, would 
be unrelated to the use of the study drug . 
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related to the intervention.  
Adverse event does not have temporal  relationship to 
intervention,  could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state, could have been due to 
environmental or other interventions, does not follow 
known pattern of response to intervention, does not 
reappear or worsen with reintroduction of intervention . 
Related to 
investigational 
agent/intervention  
 Possible  The AE may be related to the intervention.  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug and the event follows a known response pattern to the study drug BUT the event 
could have been produced by [CONTACT_59559], based on the pathophysiology of the condition, and the pharmacology of the study drug, would 
be unlikely related to the use of the study drug OR the 
event could be the effect of a concomitant medication . 
Probable  The AE is likely related to the intervention.  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug, the event follows a known response pattern to the study drug AND the event 
cannot have been reasonably explained by [CONTACT_59560] a 
concomitant medication . 
Definite  The AE is clearly related to the intervention.  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug, the event follows a known response pattern to the study drug and based on the 
known pharmacology of the study drug, the event is 
clearly related to the effect of the study drug.  The adverse event improves upon discontinuation of the study drug and 
reappears upon repeat exposure.  
 
 
 
 
   
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_64614] Off -Therapy  
Subjects will be removed  from the study therapy for the following reasons:  
• Progressive neoplastic disease 
• Subject  or guardian withdraws consent to continue in the trial  
• Subject  develops an intercurrent illness that precludes further participation, or requires a 
prohibited concomitant treatment  
• The Investigator withdraws the subject  in the subject ’s best interests  
• Subject  is lost to follow -up (defined as the inability to contact [CONTACT_59561] 3 separate 
occasions over a period of 2 weeks)  
• Administrative reasons (e.g., the subject  is transferred to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677])  
• An adverse event, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], precludes further trial 
participation or fulfills the protocol requirements for withdrawal  
• Death  
 
11.[ADDRESS_64615] Off -Study  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study completely which includes withdrawal from survival follow -up for the following reasons:  
• Completion of all study requirements  
• Subject or guardian withdraws consent to continue in the trial  (if this occurs, no further 
study visits or data may be collected)  
• Subject is lost to follow -up (defined as the inability to contact [CONTACT_1175] 3 separate 
occasions over a period of 2 weeks)  
• Death  
 
11.3 Trial Discontinuation   
The Neuroblastoma and Medulloblastoma Translational Research Consortium (NMTRC) may 
discontinue the trial as a whole or at an individual investigational site at any time. Reasons for 
early trial discontinuation may include, but are not limited to, unacceptable toxicity of 
treatment regimens, a request to discontinue the trial from a regulatory authority, protocol 
violations at an investigational site, violations of good clinical practice at an investigational 
site, or poor enrollment. The NMTRC  will promptly inform all Investigators in the event of 
premature study discontinuation and provide all Investigators with instructions regarding the 
disposition of subject s still on study. Should the study be terminated prematurely, all case 
report forms and any other study material will be returned to the NMTRC .  
 
[ADDRESS_64616] (DSMB)   
An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will oversee the conduct of the 
study. The members of this Board will receive database summaries, including adverse event 
reports, and will convene either in person or via teleconference according to section 3.[ADDRESS_64617] will be responsible for decisions regarding possible termination and/or early reporti ng of 
the study.  
12.[ADDRESS_64618] deviations, and 95% confidence intervals.  The total time duration to treatment initiation and time to completion of the first cycle of treatment will also be 
examined using Kaplan- Meier plots since some patients who are considered process failures or 
who do not complete the full duration to the completion of the first cycle of treatment may 
contribute censored data.  The formal hypothesis testing of the feasibility or success is based upon 
the 2 -stage Mini -Max testing process outlined in Section 8: Sample Size Justification.   Further 
quantification of the feasibility success rate will be based upon the percentage of the n = [ADDRESS_64619] 95% confidence interval using a Binomial distribution model due to 
the small sample size involved.  
12.4 Secondary Data Analysis  
Overall response rates (ORR) will be examined using rates for each of the clinical response categories supplemented using exact 95% confidence intervals.  Progression free survival (PFS) data for each of the three clinical strata will be examined using Kaplan -Meier time to event plots.  
Differences in the PFS for the current treatment protocol with historical PFS values will be explored using Cox proportional hazard rate methods when possible.  
 
[ADDRESS_64620] ’s legal representative 
has given written informed consent. The NMTRC  will provide the site Investigators with a 
sample informed consent document that conforms to all the requirements for informed consent 
according to ICH GCP and US FDA guidelines (21 CFR 50). However, it is up to each site 
Investigator to provide a final informed consent that may include additional elements required by [CONTACT_737]’s institution or local regulatory authorities. The IRB/EC for each investigational 
site must approve the consent form document prior to study activation; changes to the consent 
form during the course of the study may also require IRB/EC approval. The informed consent 
document must clearly describe the potential risks and benefits of the trial, and each prospective 
participant must be given adequate time to discuss the trial with the Investigator or site staff and 
to decide whether or not to participate. Each subject  who agrees to participate in the trial and who 
signs the informed consent will be given a copy of the signed dated and witnessed document. The original copy of the signed, dated and witnessed informed consent document will be retained by 
[CONTACT_59562]. After the tumor board has made a therapy decision and that 
decision has been reviewed by  [CONTACT_32335] , a therapy specific treatment memo  will be signed.  
 
   
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_64621]  to use and/or disclose protected 
health information in compliance with the Health Insurance Portabiltiy and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA). Written HIPAA authorization may be obtained as part of the informed consent process.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_64622] of the Study and IRB/IEC Approval   
The study will be conducted according to the principles of the [ADDRESS_64623] s about the trial to the local IRB/IEC for approval prior to enrolling any subject  
into the trial. The IRB/IEC should be duly constituted according to applicable regulatory requirements. Approval must be in the form of a letter signed by [CONTACT_59563]/IEC 
or the Chairperson’s designee, must be on IRB/IEC stationary and must include the protocol by 
[CONTACT_59564]/or designated number. If an Investigator is a member of the IRB/IEC, the approval 
letter must stipulate that the Investigator did not participate in the final vote, although the 
Investigator may participate in the discussion of the trial. The Investigator will also inform the 
IRB/IEC of any serious adverse events that are reported to regulatory authorities and will provide to the IRB/IEC a final summary of the results of the trial at the conclusion of the trial.  
 
Any amendments to the protocol will be done through the NMTRC , and will be submitted to the 
coordinating IRB/IEC for review and written approval before implementation.  
 
13.3 Monitoring   
An independent study monitor will make regularly scheduled trips to the investigational site to 
review the progress of the trial. The actual frequency of monitoring trips will depend on the 
enrollment rate and performance at each site. At each visit, the monitor will review various 
aspects of the trial including, but not limited to, screening and enrollment logs; compliance with 
the protocol and with the principles of Good Clinical Practice; completion of case report forms; 
source data verification; facilities and staff.  
 
During scheduled monitoring visits, the Investigator and the investigational site staff must be 
available to meet with the study monitor in order to discuss the progress of the trial, make 
necessary corrections to case report form entries, respond to data clarification requests and 
respond to any other trial -related inquiries of the monitor.  
 
In addition to the above, representatives of the NMTRC  or government inspectors may review the 
conduct/results of the trial at the investigational site. The Investigator at each site must promptly 
notify the NMTRC  of any audit requests by [CONTACT_12721].  
 
A separate monitoring plan will be provided for additional monitoring guidelines.

Bevacizumab  
 
The following table outlines the side effects of bevacizumab that we know about. The side effects 
presented may not be dose -dependent, which means that a higher dose of bevacizumab many not 
result in more severe side effects.  More importantly, it means that a lower dose may not mean 
fewer side effects and that serious side effects may occur even at the lowest doses tested.

* There have been reported cases but the relationship to the study drug is unclear.  
**The use of bevacizumab is associated with an increased risk of conditions related to clots in the arteries, including stroke or heart attack; these conditions can be life- threatening or fatal.  When 
several studies were looked at together, problems due to clots in arteries were increased up to 4 -
   
 
Version 2.0 Final  Page 95 of 268  Confidential  
Issued 12 June 2013  
 5% in patients receiving chemotherapy plus bevacizumab compared to chemotherapy alone (2%).  
Patients who were elderly and with past history of clots in the arteries appeared to be at a greater risk for these problems.  
 There is currently no experience using bevacizumab in children.  Studies of the drug in animals showed a decrease in ovarian function and abnormal bone growth.  These side effects appeared to be at least partially reversible, but have not been assessed in cases of long -term use of the drug.  
The greatest effects on growth were on the long leg bones of growing animals.  Adult women of child -bearing age who have received bevacizumab have continued to have normal periods.  The 
potential risks for impaired growth and development are of particular concern to children.   
  In studies in adults, many patients experience mild to moderate increases in blood pressure which 
may need to be lowered with medication.  Uncontrolled high blood pressure can be serious or 
life-threatening. Some patients have also experienced excessive amounts of protein in the urine 
which has rarely progressed to permanent and serious kidney disease. Because this drug acts on blood vessels bleeding and blood clots appear to be more common than with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Minor bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_59385].  However, bleeding has 
occurred in the brain, the stomach and intestines and within the tumor itself, occasionally causing it to rupture.   Blot clots are most often associated with intravenous catheters, but can also involve 
the brain  (stroke), the lungs (pulmonary embolus) and the blood supply to other vital organs of 
the body.   In adults these side effects, while infrequent, have been life -threatening and even fatal. 
We will closely monitor children on this study for all of these effects.  
 
Patients who develop anemia or low platelet counts may require red blood cell or platelet 
transfusions and as a result transfusion of blood and/or blood components may be necessary. Transfusions may be accompanied or followed by [CONTACT_59572]/or reactions that can cause kidney 
failure, heart failure, anemia, hepatitis, A.I.D.S. (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and 
other infections . 
 
If a person gets pregnant while receiving bevacizumab, it could be dangerous for the baby. You 
should not become pregnant or father a baby [CONTACT_56035]. You should not nurse (breast feed) a baby [CONTACT_56035]. Ask about counseling and more information about preventing pregnancy. 
 
We will tell you if we learn any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to stay in this study.

Dasatinib 
Likely: 
• Low platelet count which may lead to bleeding or bruising 
 
• Diarrhea  
 
Less Likely:  
 
• Low Blood Counts:  low red blood cell count may make you feel tired; low white 
blood cell count increases the risk of infection, fever or pneumonia.  
 
• Skin-related:  reddening of the face with feelings of warmth; itching; rash with 
peeling of the skin.  
 
• Stomach/Intestine- related:  loss of appetite; excessive gas in the intestines; 
nausea; vomiting; bloating; loss of water from the body; stomach pain  
 
• General:  infection; headache; tingling, burning, or prickling sensation; fatigue; 
fever  
 
• Laboratory test -related:  abnormal liver function; temporary increase in the 
blood of creatinine which may indicate kidney damage  
   
 
Version 2.0 Final  Page 132 of 268 Confidential

• Risk of Bleeding:  there is a risk of bleeding which may be life -threatening.  
Specifically, damage to the intestine may result in bleeding.  
 
• Fluid Retention:  fluid buildup in the lungs that can make you feel short of breath  
 
 
Rare But Serious:  
 
• Damage to the sac around the heart which can lead to a build -up of fluid around 
the heart which may be painful and affect the ability of the heart to work 
normally. 
 
• Tumor Lysis Syndrome:   very rapid death of cancer cells releases chemicals 
which may lead to reduced kidney function.  Accumulation of these chemicals 
may harm muscle or nerve function.  
 
Side effects reported by [CONTACT_1962], but it is not certain yet if they are related to taking the drug 
Dasatinib:  
 
• Low Blood Counts:  decrease in the number of immune system cells; low numbers 
of white blood cells called lymphocytes that may last a long time and make it 
easier to get infections which may be life threatening.  
 
• Heart -related:  a rapid heart rate of over 100 beats per minute; chest pain that 
may mean heart damage; irregular heartbeat; problems with the electrical system 
of the heart; high blood pressure  
 
• General:  inability to sleep; rigors/chills; changes in your weight  
 
 • Skin-related:  an allergic reaction in the blood vessels of the skin which turn the 
skin red, inflamed and bumpy and which may lead to skin breakdown; acne; 
changes in your nails; open sores on the skin; hives; puffiness or swelling around the eyes  
 
• Stomach/Intestine- related:  constipation; dry mouth; inflammation of the small 
intestine; difficulty or discomfort in swallowing; ulcer in the small intestine; heartburn; painful mouth sores  
 
• Fluid Retention:  excess buildup of fluids in body tissues; usually the tissues of 
the head, neck, buttocks, and genital areas  
 
• Laboratory test -related:  high levels of enzymes in the blood which could affect 
liver, kidney, and heart functions; decrease in the level of magnesium in the blood. 
 
• Muscle/Joint -related:  stiffness of the neck, pain in the muscles and bones; pain 
throughout the body; back pain; pain in the arms and legs.

 Decitabine  
While on the study, you are at risk for side effects (see table below). You should discuss these 
with your child’s doctor. If you experience any side effects you may be given other medications 
to make them less serious or uncomfortable. We believe that most side effects will go away 
shortly after treatment with decitabine is stopped, but in some cases side effects may be serious, long lasting or permanent. There may also be other side effects that we cannot predict.  There is also a small, but real possibility that life -threatening complications, death, or a second cancer may 
occur.

stomach or pelvic pain and /or may lead to 
the appearance of blood in the urine  • Inflammation of the 
pancreas  
• Stomach and intestinal 
tract bleeding from 
ulcers  
• Infections 
• Increased pressure in 
the brain which can lead to difficulty seeing, pressure in the 
eyes and headache

• Serious changes in 
mood, personality and/or severe 
depression 
* This effect happens less often in patients less than 10 years of age.  
 Steroid drugs, such as dexamethasone (and less frequently prednisone), are known causes of a 
disease called “osteonecrosis” (ON). Osteonecrosis results from the temporary or permanent loss of the blood supply to the bones. Without blood, the bone tissue dies and causes the bone to 
breakdown. ON is most commonly seen in the hip joint. If the bones near a joint breakdown it can 
cause the joint to collapse. ON can cause pain and if severe, the patient may need to have surgery. The exact reason why corticosteroids cause ON is not known.

*  One patient with no known history of liver problems died on study due to liver failure. This patient was also taking acetaminophen (Tylenol®), also known as paracetamol in 
European countries. It is recommended you adhere carefully to the instructions and 
warnings on the acetaminophen package label.  Additionally, it is recommended that over-the- counter medications be carefully reviewed, as these may possibly contain 
combinations of drugs, including acetaminophen or paracetamol.  
  Since there is an increased risk of bleeding when taking imatinib mesylate 
(Gleevec), the blood anticoagulant warfarin sodium must not be taken. Your doctor will discuss alternatives with you. However, even when alternative anti clotting drugs are used it will be 
necessary to closely watch for bleeding and to maintain platelet counts at a safe level with 
transfusion if necessary.  Bleeding may occur into a tumor or a space near the tumor and may be dangerous.

seen so far in people getting this drug are listed below.  Some of these problems might not have been related to the drug.  
  
 Risks and side effects related to CC -5013 include:  
  
 Low blood counts:  low number of red blood cells, increased or decreased levels of white 
blood cells which help fight infection, low number of platelets which help the blood to clot, breakdown of red blood cells.  
  
 Heart -related:  abnormal heart rhythm, unusually fast or slow heartbeat, changes in your 
heart tracing (EKG), chest pain, high or low blood pressure, blockage of blood vessels decreasing the blood supply to the heart. A [ADDRESS_64646] been related to the CC -5013. She recovered, but 
people can die from heart attacks.  
 CC-5013 can cause blood clots in veins.  These clots could break off and block veins or 
arteries in other parts of the body, such as the heart or lungs.  Blood clots may be more 
likely in patients who are getting certain medicines like corticosteroids (prednisone, 
dexamethasone), interferon, erythropoietin (a medicine to make the red blood cells increase) or chemotherapy.  Patients who smoke or who do not move around very much 
may also be more likely to have blood clots.  If you have pain or swelling in an arm or 
leg, or feel chest pain or have trouble breathing, you should call your doctor right away.  You might need to come to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59462].

Risks and Discomforts  
If you agree to enroll in this study, there may be some risks to your health and well -being.  
Known side effects associated with minocycline use are: sensitivity to sunlight (frequent; greater 
than 20%); dizziness; constipation; nausea; vomiting; and loss of appetite (occasional; 2 to 20%).  
To avoid sunlight sensitivity, you can use sunscreen, wear clothing with long sleeves and long pants, and try to stay out of direct sun as much as possible.  In rare cases (less than 2%), staining 
of the outer layer of teeth, kidney disease, anemia (low iron and red blood cells which may cause 
tiredness and shortness of breath), and liver disease have been reported.   
 Rare instances of inflammation of the esophagus (or food pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836]) and ulcers in the esophagus have 
also been reported with minocycline.  To reduce the risk of irritation of the esophagus, your study 
medication, if taken by [CONTACT_1966], should be taken with a full glass of water (8 ounces).  If you 
   
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_64649] report this to your study doctor immediately. The 
study medication can be taken with or without food.  
 
Other side effects of minocycline include rash, hives, headache, joint pain, and allergic reactions 
(rare; 1 -3%).  
 Serious allergic reactions that can be life- threatening may occur with minocycline use.  
 You should be very careful when driving or using machinery until you know  how the study 
drug(s) will affect you.  This is because the study medication(s) may cause drowsiness, dizziness, 
lack of coordination, or slow your reaction time.  
 
There may be other risks which are not known at this time and which we cannot predict.  
 Minocycline may not be as effective if taken with any antacids, calcium supplements, iron products, and laxatives containing magnesium. None of these medications may be taken within 2 hours before or after taking Minocycline.  
In addition, minocycline may interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.  Therefore, for female subjects of childbearing potential, the addition of a barrier method of contraception (condom or diaphragm) will be required during the study.  Minocycline may be dangerous to an 
unborn child (fetus or embryo). If, at any time during the study, you suspect that you are 
pregnant, you must immediately notify your study doctor.

Saha  
 
You may have side effects while on the study.  Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects.  However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen.  Side effects may be mild or very serious. Your health care team may give you medicines to help 
lessen side effects. Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking SAHA.  In some cases, 
side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away .  The combination of SAHA and 
13-cis RA (for those children who will take both) may result in an unexpected toxicity.   
 You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study.    
 
A child getting SAHA had blood clotting in his blood vessels, and this may be related to the SAHA.  
 
There have been reports of changes in blood clotting ability in patients who received both 
coumadin  and SAHA. If you are receiving coumadin, you will be monitored carefully for signs related to 
increased risk of bleeding (such as easy bruising, bleeding from nose, gums etc.) In addition, the 
ability of your blood to clot will be watched more closely (at least monthly).  
 
 
Risks and side effects that adults who have been given SAHA had included those which are:  
 Likely  
 
• Low Blood Counts: decreased red blood cells (anemia), lower numbers of white 
blood cells (infection fighting cells) which may increase your risk of infection, decrease in the type of blood cells that act to help stop bleeding when you are 
cut. 
• feeling tired  
• weight loss  
• decreased appetite 
• diarrhea (watery bowel movements)  
• nausea  
• vomiting

 • weak kidney function  
• high levels of sugar in the blood  
• bleeding of the upper digestive tract  
Less Likely:   
 
Low Blood Counts: decreased number of a type of white blood cells, fever with dangerously low 
white blood cell count, infection that occurs when the white blood cell count is low.

• Severe allergic reactions which can be life threatening or fatal with may include shortness of breath, low 
blood pressure, rapid heart rate, chills and fever,  aches and pains in the muscles or joints, and abnormal 
laboratory values in blood tests  
• Severe allergic reaction which can be life threatening with rapid build -up of fluid under the skin, in the 
lining of the intestine and possibly in the throat or swelling of the tongue which could make it difficult to breath.  
• Irritation of the small airways of your lungs that can make you cough and wheeze  
• Inflammation of the part of the intestines known as the colon which can lead to infection, blood in the stools and abdominal (belly) pain  
• Severe rashes which can affect the skin and mucous membranes and be life- threatening  
• Bleeding due to irritation of the gastrointestinal tract and/or from erosion of the lining of the stomach 
(an ulcer) which if untreated could rupture and may be fatal    
• Inflammation or damage to the liver which can be severe and life -threatening and which may lead to an 
enlarged liver, a yellow appearing skin, and fluid collection in the abdomen which makes it look larger.  
• Inflammation of the pancreas (an organ in the abdomen which produces insulin and certain digestive 
chemicals) which may affect the function of the pancreas and which may cause pain in the abdomen (belly)which can be severe and may increase the blood sugar  
• Severe damage to the kidney which may be irreversible and lead to kidney failure  
• Drugs of this type called non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have been associated with 
severe cardiovascular events such as heart attack, high blood pressure or stroke. This is more likely to occur in patients who are older, who have had coronary artery surgery or who have diseases that make them more susceptible to events of this type.  
• Seizures   
• Changes in mood which may include severe depression, feelings of suicide, and feelings of 
aggressiveness  
• Temporary inflammation of the brain which could lead to a stiff neck and severe headaches.  
• Damage to the heart muscle which may make you tired, weak, feel short of breath, and retain fluid  
• Fewer white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets in the blood  
-a low number of white blood cells can make it easier  
 to get infections  
-a low number of red blood cells can make you feel  
 tired and weak  
-a low number of platelets causes you to bruise and

            * Trastuzumab rarely causes decreases in heart function when administered by [CONTACT_5071]. 
When Trastuzumab is given alone, these changes in heart function are usually reversible.  
When Trastuzumab is given in combination with chemotherapy drugs called 
anthracyclines (for example doxorubicin) or cyclophosphamide, there is a much greater 
risk of heart damage, though this complication is still uncommon. Such damage can result in a rapid heart beat, decreased pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_59498], and accumulation 
of fluid in the lungs which may rarely interfere with breathing.  
          **Some patients may have a severe of life -threatening reaction during or after treatment 
with Trastuzumab.  These reactions can involve a drop in blood pressure and shortness of breath, and have resulted in death in several patients.  These severe reactions may be 
more common in patients who already have breathing difficulties or lung disease.  If you develop any clear discomfort during or after a treatment with Trastuzumab, you should contact [CONTACT_59626].

Vorinostat 
 
Risks and side effects related to the vorinostat include those which are:  
Likely  
• Low Blood Counts: decreased red blood cells that carry oxygen in the body 
(anemia), decrease in a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, decreased total numbers of white blood cells (infection fighting cells) which may increase your risk of infection, decrease in the type of blood cells called platelets that help 
to clot blood.  
• fatigue 
• weight loss  
• loss of appetite  
• diarrhea  
• nausea  
• vomiting  
• high blood level of creatinine, a substance normally eliminated by [CONTACT_59629] 
• high level of sugar in the blood  
 
 
  
 Less Likely   
• Low Blood Counts: decreased number of a type of white blood cell called 
lymphocytes 
• changes in heart rhythm  
• abnormal levels of blood protein in a blood test to check blood clotting ability  
• fever  
• chills  
• hair loss  
• constipation 
• dehydration 
• dry mouth  
• heartburn 
• taste alteration  
• fever with dangerously low white blood cell count  
• infection  
• swelling of the limbs such as the arms or legs  
• low levels of a blood protein called albumin  
• abnormal liver or bone enzyme level  
• abnormal liver enzyme level  
• abnormal level of bilirubin in the blood.  Bilirubin is a bile pi[INVESTIGATOR_59503].  
• decreased  blood calcium level  
• increased blood magnesium  level  
• decreased blood phosphate level  
• decreased blood potassium level

 • decreased blood sodium level  
• muscle spasms  
• muscle weakness  
• dizziness  
• Condition of the nervous system that causes numbness, tingling, burning.  
• pain in the abdomen or belly  
• headache  
• cough 
• shortness of breath  
• formation or presence of a blood clot inside a blood vessel.

Likely  
Happens to 10-
30  patients out 
of every 100  Less Likely  
Happens to 3- 10 patients out of every 100  Rare But Serious  
Happens to less than 3 patients 
out of every 100  
• Fatigue 
(tiredness) 
• Flu-like 
symptoms 
including 
fever, chills, 
and joint and muscle aches, which are generally seen after the first infusion 
• Low levels of calcium in the blood which may cause 
muscle cramps  
• Anorexia (loss 
of appetite)  
      
 • Headaches  
• Insomnia 
• Anxiety 
• Stomach irritation  
• Bone, back, muscle, and joint pain  
• Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)  
• Abnormal kidney function tests  
• Diarrhea • Tingling in the fingers and toes  
• Nausea, vomiting, constipation, and /or 
abdominal pain  
• Low red blood cell counts which may cause tiredness, shortness of breath or fatigue 
• Allergic reactions, which include itching, flushing, rash, and shortness of breath  
• Low levels of potassium, magnesium, and/or phosphate in the blood. In almost all cases, you would not experience symptoms from these effects. If these levels fall to extremely low levels, possible side effects could include muscle twitching, muscle weakness, and abnormal heart rhythm.  
• A reaction at the injection site, which might include pain, redness, tenderness, 
swelling, and/or bruising.  • Kidney failure  
• Severe allergic reactions  
• Permanent damage to the jawbone that may be painful and might require surgery to remove the 
damaged area.  There is more 
information about this below.* 
This might be more likely to happen in patients who have certain dental procedures. If you see a dentist, you should inform them that you are receiving zoledronic acid.  
• Serious eye problems. If you suspect you are having an eye side effect after receiving the study 
drug, you should call the study 
doctor.  
• Chest pain  
• Red puffy eyes (conjunctivitis)  
• Low platelets (increased risk for bleeding)  
• Low white blood count (increased risk of infection)  
• Low blood pressure  
*A condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been seen in patients taking zoledronic 
acid or other bisphosphonates. This happens in less than 1% of patients.  ONJ can show up as a non-healing wound in the gum tissue covering the jaw bone, or roof of the mouth, that exposes 
the bone. The wound can be painful, can worsen over time and often involves an infection in the 
area with ONJ. This means a portion of the jawbone becomes permanently damaged, may be

were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids.  Other risk factors for ONJ include 
radiotherapy and concurrent medical conditions (for example, anemia, a defect in the blood 
clotting mechanism, infection and pre -existing oral disease).  In most cases, the patient also had 
surgery in the mouth or a tooth removed.  ONJ has been much less frequently reported in non-
cancer patients taking bisphosphonates.  For patients requiring oral surgery, there are no data 
available to suggest whether stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_59504].  In 
patients who develop ONJ, surgery at the affected area may make the condition worse.  If you 
think you have this condition see your Study Doctor and dentist immediately.

We will analyze number of use, the cumulative and per day usage of analgesic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536].  
  Background ( Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):   
 
Ureteroscopy is one of the mainstays of the surgical management of upper urinary tract calculi. In most 
cases, a ureteral stent is left postoperatively which unfortunately can lead to significant morbidity and discomfort for the patient.
1 More than 80% of patients with a stent post-ureteroscopy report pain that interferes 
with their daily activities.[ADDRESS_331762] age- adjusted rates of drug overdose deaths 
in the country.3 Rates of death from overdose in Arizona was also shown to be increasing in recent years. Give n 
the dramatic increase in opi[INVESTIGATOR_271627], there has been a significant move towards finding alternative medications to manage patients’ pain.  
There are numerous biologically active compounds derived from Cannabis sativa, including the main 
phytocannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabindiol (CBD)
4,5. THC is the psychoactive 
cannabinoid derived from the flowers and leaves of the marijuana plant with intoxicating effects through the CB1 receptor. CBD is the main component of oil derived from the flowers and leaves of the hemp plant. It has a more complex mechanism of action than THC and has been shown to reduce inflammation, anxiety, and seizures
4. Federal and state laws permit the growth and sale of hemp products, including CBD oil, provided the 
THC content does not exceed 0.3% of the dry weight5. Products with a THC content not exceeding 0.3% of the 
dry weight should not have the psychoactive effects known with THC and therefore theoretically have less risk of misuse or diversion and better safety profile than narcotics
5.  
CBD oil has been purified as an oral solution as the drug Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]. It received FDA approval for the 
treatment of rare seizure disorders in 2018 (FDA approval). Preclinical data have shown promise for the use in chronic pain with anti- inflammatory, antinociceptive and in the treatment of addiction
5. It has not been studied 
in the postoperative or postureteroscopy setting. 
There is a significant amount of research studying the role of cannabinoids in chronic pain management, 
however very little research has been done on post-operative pain management with cannabinoids.[ADDRESS_331763] been shown to be effective in chronic pelvic pain syndrome/chronic prostatitis and help bladder dysfunction in multiple sclerosis patients.
7,8 Cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) 
are present in the bladder, testis, prostate, and vas deferens.[ADDRESS_331764]- surgery in general, but with increasing criticism on opi[INVESTIGATOR_271628], it is an arena that warrants investigation. Therefore, we propose a novel double blind randomized controlled study to compare pain control and safety with CBD oil and oxycodone (opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]) in the post- operative 
setting after ureteroscopy for urinary calculi.

 Randomization and allocation 
Patients will be randomized to one of two groups – trial medication or placebo.  Randomization 
schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_4305]. Block randomization will be used to ensure temporal 
balance.  Once patients have consented to being included in the study, they will be assigned a sequential study number, which will be passed onto the pharmacy study contact [CONTACT_271636].  They will then dispense encapsulated trial medication based on that allocation.  
 
Blinding  
This is designed to be a double blinded, placebo controlled trial in which neither the patient nor the 
clinical team is aware of the group allocation.  The medications will be packaged inside a syringe .  The 
medication will be dispensed to the patient with a label that describes both  medications, strengths, and 
administration schedule.  The clinical team will be blinded to the allocation and will only receive the dispensed drug from the pharmacy contact [CONTACT_271637].  
 Preoperative and perioperative procedures  
• Patient will undergo standard preoperative procedures including baseline blood work (CBC, BMP, and 
LFTs ), imaging, and medical clearance as required.  
• The procedure itself will be performed per standard practice of the surgeon, including choice of instruments, manner of fragmentation, and postoperative management of patient with regards to follow 
up appointments, stent placement and removal.   
Postoperative procedures  
• The study pharmacy will disguise the appropriate drug into an unlabeled generic container and dispense 
the prescription with appropriate instructions.   
• In the recovery room, the patient will fill out a 100mm pain visual analog scale sheet which will be kept in the study drawer in the urology department. 
• The patient will then be given a packet of materials for data collection along with the syringe  with the 
blinded medication with full administration instructions and safety leaflet.   
• The patient will fill out the data sheets for pain scale, trial, rescue and other medication usage, and adverse events on a daily basis for three days.  The patient will also fill out the Ureteric Stent Symp toms 
Questionnaire (USSQ) on postoperative days 1 and 3.   
• Patient will then mail the data sheets to the urology department using a provided stamped -addressed 
envelope or hand in the data sheets at their postoperative appointment. 
• The patient will be required to bring all unused trial medication to the postoperative appointment, which will then be returned to the pharmacy staff.   
 
Rescue medication protocol  
• Patients will be prescribed an opi[INVESTIGATOR_271629] 
(12 tabs of oxycodone 5 mg). This can be taken at the patient’s discretion for increased pain. 
• All usage of opi[INVESTIGATOR_271630].

 • Given that the presence of the stent itself can be a significant factor in the pain and discomfort for 
patients undergoing URS, we will also allow for patients to be prescribed oxybutynin, tamsulosin  and/or 
phenazopyridine at the discretion of the clinical team.  These two medications, along with tamsulosin 
(given to patients routinely following URS) are very commonly used to mitigate stent pain in post- URS 
patients.  Use of all adjunct medications will be recorded by [CONTACT_271638].  
Emergency situation procedures  
Participants will be given a patient card, which will have the study title, investigational medication product 
details, participant identification number and contact [CONTACT_271639].  If a patient has pain which is not controlled despi[INVESTIGATOR_271631], then patient will have the option to call into the surgeon’s office (during business hours) or the after-hours call number, which is usually directed to the resident on call.  The patient will give the trial information on the patient card to the resident returning the call. Treatment plan at that point will be developed by [CONTACT_271640].  This may include medications prescribed over the phone, scheduling office visits as well as emergency room visits.    
Subject withdrawal  
Participants will remain on the trial unless they choose to withdraw or they no longer meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.    
Outcome measures  
The primary outcome measure will be the pain score given by [CONTACT_271641] 100mm continuous visual analog 
scale (VAS).  The VAS is an easy to use instrument for evaluating pain severity.  It provides reproducible 
results that do not differ with age, gender or cause of pain.  It is sensitive to treatment effects and data derived 
from it can be analyzed with standard parametric statistical techniques.
 Each day, patients will record their 
maximum and average pain scores.  Surveys to record the pain scores and rescue drug (oxycodone) administration will be handed to the patient on day of surgery as well as emailed out via an external REDCap database. We will combine the results from each study and compare the primary outcome between the two groups (i.e. control group and CBD oil  group) in two ways: 1. overall, and 2. on a per day basis. 
Secondary outcomes 
• We will compare the number of use, the cumulative and per day usage of analgesic opi[INVESTIGATOR_271632]. 
• Usage of other medications, either self -administered, or prescribed will be compared 
• The rate of adverse clinical events defined  as the rate of adverse drug reactions, rate of unscheduled 
phone calls, emergency room visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], and clinic visits will be compared between the 
two groups. Collection of adverse events will be done by a combination of patient self -report on data 
sheets and data gathering from electronic medical record to search for evidence of phone calls, emergency room visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], clinic visit notes.  
• Comparison of ureteral stent symptom questionnaire (USSQ) scores on postoperative days 1 and 3.

 Data Analysis Plan:   All the study data will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086]. We anticipate the baseline characteristics between study groups will be comparable due to randomization. The point estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the primary and secondary outcomes (pain score and USSQ scores) will be reported and compared by [CONTACT_112913] -sample t- test. If there is imbalance in the baseline characteristics between groups, we will 
fit a regression model to adjust for the possible confounding effect. The use of analgesi c opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] 
(number of use, cumulative and per day usage) will be reported and compared by [CONTACT_112913]- sample t -test or Chi-
square test. All the adverse events observed during the study period will be reported and summarized by [CONTACT_271642].

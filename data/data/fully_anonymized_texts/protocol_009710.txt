Background Information
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide.

3,[ADDRESS_188156] the possible presence of these conditions. The PHQ-2 / PHQ-[ADDRESS_188157] commonly used diagnostic 
instrument. Even though the US Preventive Services Taskforce and the American Academy of 
Family Physicians recommend screening in individuals 12 and older,
9,10
with the US primary 
care visit averaging 16 minutes, mental health screening is frequently skipped,
11
and only an 
estimated 4.2% of primary care patients are screened for these conditions.
The DSM-5, the standard classification of mental disorders used by [CONTACT_162103], has definitions for MDD and anxiety disorders. However, reliability of psychiatric 
diagnosis is still low, even among psychiatrists.
12
Because psychiatric diagnoses are often 
based on inferences derived from observation of patient behavior and patient self-reports, 
interrater reliability are moderate, typi[INVESTIGATOR_162090] 0.4 to 0.6.
13
Primary care clinicians provide the majority and an increasing percentage of mental health 
care.
11
If the agreement between psychiatrists, specialists
trained specifically on mental health 
care is low - the expectation is that it will be even more challenging for primary care clinicians to 
diagnose depression and anxiety.
According to a global
Lancet study,
the General Practitioners’ 
sensitivity is 47.3%.

wellness and mental health over time to promote mental wellbeing. Based upon their preliminary 
work and user engagement, the Kintsugi team applied for and was awarded several National 
Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants to develop new Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) technologies in healthcare. Most recently, the team is developi[INVESTIGATOR_162091]-based 
algorithm that is able to detect signs of depression and anxiety from short clips of free-form 
speech. The Kintsugi Voice Device
is the result of
these efforts.
Voice biomarker technologies provide a unique way to scale access to mental healthcare by 
[CONTACT_162104]-volume environments where 
administrative burdens are high and mental health conditions are often overlooked. 
Researchers have attempted to find objective methods to increase the accuracy of depression 
and generalized anxiety disorder diagnoses, and voice-based biomarkers are attractive 
because of their non-invasive nature and ability to provide passive monitoring.

Study Device Description
The Kintsugi Voice Device (“Device”) is a software API [INVESTIGATOR_162092] a voice 
sample for analysis from an individual ≥ [ADDRESS_188159] to clinical assessment and provides a sensitive reliable estimate 
of the presence of vocal characteristics consistent with a significant depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_36192]/or a 
clinically significant anxiety state, which are a necessary condition for the diagnosis of lifetime 
mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder. The 
Kintsugi Voice Device is not to be used in-lieu of full patient evaluation or relied upon to make or 
confirm diagnosis but offers objective signals in the global assessment of mood and anxiety 
disorders.
The Device comprises of the following:
●
An API [INVESTIGATOR_162093]. Input of the API [CONTACT_832] a
patient voice sample that is at least 60 seconds
●
Underlying machine learning algorithm that drives the Device outputs (“Algorithm”)
●
Depression and Anxiety are separate algorithms
The Device output is the following:
●
For depression:
○
The voice sample contains characteristics of depression (the model has high
confidence that the speaker has depression),
○
The voice sample does not contain characteristics of depression (the model has
high confidence that the speaker does not have depression),
○
Indeterminate (the model doesn’t have high confidence to classify the patient as
depressed or not depressed)
●
For anxiety:
○
The voice sample contains characteristics of anxiety (the model has high
confidence that the speaker has anxiety),
○
The voice sample does not contain characteristics of anxiety (the model has high
confidence that the speaker does not have anxiety),
○
Indeterminate (the model doesn’t have high confidence to classify the patient as
anxious or not anxious)

System or Device Components Description
15

The
Device
is
composed
of
a
neural
network-based
algorithm
that
analyzes
voice
recordings
to
screen
for
signs
of
depression
and
anxiety.
The
audio
files
that
are
used
as
input
to
the
algorithm
are
recorded
by
[CONTACT_162105]
(e.g.,
cellphone,
tablet,
laptop)
and
are
stored
as
uncompressed
audio
in
raw
form.
It
is
then
pre-processed
using
the
following
process:
●
resample the data to match specifications
●
evaluate the quality of the speech sample
●
normalize the loudness of the audio
●
transcode the audio from the original encoding to linear pulse-code modulation
●
trim the pauses at the beginning and end of the audio file
Once
processed,
vocal
features
are
extracted
from
the
audio
and
inputted
into
the
neural
network
models.
The
software
interprets
the
acquired
signals
using
signal
processing
and
an
artificial
neural
network
to
quantitatively
evaluate
voice
characteristics
for
presence
of
indicators
correlated
to
depression
and
anxiety.
The
Kintsugi
Voice
Device
then
generates
an
output
for
signs
of
depression
and
anxiety
which
is
displayed
to
the
Device
Operator.
The
Kintsugi
Voice
Device
output
will
be
positive
for
depression
or
negative
for
depression
and
positive
for
anxiety
or
negative
for
anxiety.
The
outcome
can
also
be
“uncertain”
or
within
an
“indeterminate
range”
if the Device cannot provide a high-confidence result.
Study Objectives
This study seeks to evaluate the ability of the Device to aid clinical assessment for depression
and anxiety by [CONTACT_162106] a
diagnosis made by a specialist clinician based on DSM-5 criteria.
This is a prospective study of up to
100
subjects,
ages
>
22 years of age.
We are striving for a 50%/50% split of subjects who have depression and/or anxiety and
subjects who do not have depression and/or anxiety.

Study Endpoints
Effectiveness Endpoints
The primary endpoints of this study are to:
1.
Determine the specificity and sensitivity of the Device in discriminating the presence of a
significant depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_162094]-[ADDRESS_188161] (“gold standard”)
2.
Determine the specificity and sensitivity of the Device in discriminating the presence of a
clinically significant anxiety state using the SCID-5-CT as the established diagnostic
standard
The secondary endpoints of this study are:
●
Measurement of the percentage of all adults for whom the Device provided no result
●
Determine the speciﬁcity and sensitivity of the Device
in discriminating the presence
of a significant depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_162095]-9
●
Determine the specificity and
sensitivity
of the Device
in discriminating the presence of a
clinically significant anxiety state compared to the GAD-7
Safety Endpoints
Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected and reported from
enrollment, which is determined by [CONTACT_162107], through the completion of the
study.
Study Duration
The study is expected to last up to
[ADDRESS_188162]’s
involvement in the study will be approximately [ADDRESS_188163] clinical
ground truth for major depressive disorder
and for generalized anxiety disorder. Up to 100 participants
will undergo investigational and
comparator assessments for major depressive disorder and a clinically significant anxiety state.
The research coordinator will schedule a time with the participant for the evaluation. There will
be a two-part evaluation: a web-based study survey and a specialist clinician evaluation via the
SCID assessment. The SCID assessment will include questions about the past medical history
of the participant as well as questions from the Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale.
The order of the two evaluations will be randomized to minimize any potential bias.
The Device output will be positive for depression, negative for depression, or indeterminate for
depression and positive for anxiety, negative for anxiety, or indeterminate for anxiety. PHQ-[ADDRESS_188164] as the clinical comparator for
comparison with the Device output.
Clinicians and participants will both be blinded to the participant the Device output and the
participant assessment results (SCID, PHQ-9, GAD-7). Further, a SCID reviewer may review the
recorded SCID assessment and standard clinical assessment and completed SCID template to
minimize interrater variability.
Subject Identification and Recruitment, Process of Consent
Subjects may be recruited through various mediums including but not limited to social media,
Craigslist, and/or specialized clinical trial recruitment groups. At the time of enrollment, the
mental status of the participant will not be known. Subjects may be recruited from populations
that self-select as interested in mental health. Potential subjects will be provided with detailed
study information so that they are able to make an informed decision.
If subjects wish to enroll, they will need to answer brief pre-screening questions about the
inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine if they meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Subjects ineligible for the study will be told they do not qualify. Subjects eligible for the study will
receive an informed consent form if they are interested in participating. Participant identity will
be verified before enrollment.
[ADDRESS_188165] SCID
assessments conducted over a HIPAA-compliant video-conferencing platform will be recorded
for the purposes of the study and research. A copy of the consent form will be provided to the
participant after they consent. A clinical research coordinator will be available to answer
participant questions about the study.
Randomization
The order in which the online survey and SCID assessment occur will be randomized. All
participants will participate in investigational (Kintsugi Voice Device) and comparator
assessments (SCID assessment, PHQ-9, and GAD-7).
[ADDRESS_188166] signed the informed consent form.
Participants will receive instructions on completing our web-based Study Survey. If the audio
sample from the SCID assessment is not scorable (e.g. poor microphone quality, insufficient
length, excessive background noise), the participant may be asked to submit an additional audio
sample. A clinical research team member will run the audio sample through the Device.
Participants will fill out the PHQ-[ADDRESS_188167] two years of experience diagnosing depressive and anxiety
disorders. Specialists will also undergo psychiatric assessment scoring training for the SCID
assessment prior to providing diagnoses for the study to minimize discrepancies in scoring.
Participants will complete the SCID assessment through a HIPAA compliant teleconferencing
application such as Zoom Meetings. The meeting will be recorded, and the participant will need
to consent to the recording in order to participate in the study. After the SCID assessment, the
specialists will determine a diagnosis based on whether the participant meets the DSM-5 criteria
for Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

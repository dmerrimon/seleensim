1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic eye disease characterized by [CONTACT_286818] (macula) andis the leading cause of severe 
vision loss in people affecting 10%- 13% of individuals over the age of 65 years in 
North America, Europe, and Australia (Kawasaki et al 2010 ; Rein et al 2009 ; Smith et al 2001 ). 
Genetic, environmental and health f actors play an important role i n the pathogenesis of the 
disease (Wong et al 2014 ).
AMD is classified into 2 clinical subty pes: the non-neovascular (atrophic) or dry form and the 
neovascular (exudative) or wet form (Ferris et al 1984 ; Limet al 2012 ; Miller 2013). 
Neovascular AMD is characterized by [CONTACT_258403] 
(neovascularization) under the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] ( RPE) or subretinal space from the 
subjacent choroid, termed choroidal neovascularization (CNV) (Ferris et al 1984 ). These newl y 
formed vessels have an increased likelihood to leak blood and s erum, damaging the retina by 
[CONTACT_286819]. This damage to the retina results in 
progressive, severe, and irreversible vision loss (Shah andDelPriore 2007 ; 
Shah andDelPriore 2009 ). Without treatment, most affected eyes w ill have poor central vision 
(20/200) within 12 months ( Blinder et al 2003 ). 
VEGF has been shown to be elevated in patients with neovascular AMD, and is thought to play 
a key role in the neovascularization process (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_258375] 2000 ). The use of intravitreal (IVT) 
pharmacotherap y targeting VEGF has significantly  improved visual outcom es in patients with 
neovascular AMD (Bloch et al 2012; Campbell et al 2012 ). Anti- VEGF treatments, such as 
ranibizumab (L UCENTIS®) and aflibercept (EYLEA®), inhibit VEGF sign aling pathway s and 
have been shown to halt the growth of neovascular lesions and resolve retinal edema.
Brolucizumab
Brolucizumab (RTH258, formerl y ESBA1008) is a humanized single -chain Fv (scFv) antibod y 
fragment inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor with a molecular weight of ~26 kDa. 
Brolucizumab is an inhibitor of VEGF -A and works by [CONTACT_286820] -A molecule, thereb y preventing the interaction of VEGF -A with its receptors 
VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 on the surface of endothelial cells.
A low molecular weight (a surrogate for hydrodynamic radius) should increase drug distribution 
into the target site of action, ensuring effective control of anatomical disease activity .This could 
potentially  translate into a more durabl e efficacy  and a reduced treatment burden (number of 
injections) for the patient and health care professional.
Brolucizumab in nA MD
In a single ascending dose Phase I study  (C-10- 083), the median time until patients fulfilled 
protocol defined criteria forreceipt of standard of care treatment was 30 days longer for 
brolucizumab 6 mg (P = 0.036) versus ranibizumab, with the maximum effect on best-corrected 
visual acuity  (BCVA) and central subfield thickness (CSFT) reached at Week 6 for 
brolucizumab versus Week 4 for ranibizumab. In a separate repeat dosing Phase II study 
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 13
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 00 ) Protocol No. CRTH258A2309
(C-12-006, OSPREY) comparing brolucizumab 6 mg (n = 44) ever y 8 weeks (q8w), then ever y 
12 weeks (q12w) administration, i.e. administration every q8w and q12w, respectivel y, against 
afliberc ept (q8w administration, n = 45), brolucizumab achieved comparable visual outcome 
during the loading and q8w phase, with a lower number of patients requiring additional rescue 
treatments (5 out of 44 versus 10 out of 45, respectively). Brolucizumab demonst rated a trend 
for greater improvements and more stability  in retinal anatomy  during the 4 cycles of q8w 
dosing (up to Week 40).
In the Phase III Studies RTH258 -C001 (HAWK) and RTH258- C002 (HARRIER), 
brolucizumab demonstrated non-inferiority  to aflibercept in mean change in BCVA from 
baseline to Week 48 in both trials using a non-inferiorit y margin (NIM) of [ADDRESS_349935] observed at Week 48 was largel y maintained up to the end of the 
study  (Week 96) in all treatment arms and results for BCVA-related secondary  endpoints at 
Week 96 were overall comparable with those at Week 48. These results were achieved while a 
majority  of patients on brolucizumab 6 mg –56% in HAWK and 51% in HARRI ER –were 
maintained on a q12w (every  12 weeks) dosing interval following the loading phase (baseline 
to Week 8) through Week 48. Patients in the brolucizumab 6 mg treatment group who were on 
q12w at Week 44 revealed probabilities of 81.5 % and 75.4% to remain on q12w up to week 92 
in HAWK and HARR IER, respectively. Brolucizumab 6 mg achieved superior reductions in 
CSFT versus aflibercept in both the head -to-head and mainten ance phases (P = 0.0016 and 
P =0.0023 at Week 16 and Week 48, respectively, in HAWK; P < 0.0001 at both Week 16 and 
Week 48 inHARRI ER). The greater reductions in CSFT observed at Week 48 with 
brolucizumab 6 mg or 3 mg compared to patient s treated with aflibercept 2 mg were maintained 
through Week 96. Brolucizumab safety  was comparable to aflibercept, with the overall 
incidence of adverse events (AEs) balanced across all treatment groups in both studies.
This study , CRTH258A2309, is an ECG collection study on request of the Pharmaceuticals and 
Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) of Japan . Patients from US and Puerto Rico, 50 years old o r 
greater, diagnosed with nAMD will be eligible to participate. All enrolled patients will recei ve 
one (1)intravitreal dose of brolucizumab [ADDRESS_349936] ECG data after a single IVT injection of brolucizumab 
6mg in patients with neovascular age -related macular degeneration (nAMD).

Figure 3-[ADDRESS_349941] of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical 
Devi ces Agency  (PMDA) of Japan to provide ECG data on approximately  10-15 patients  at 
the time at which maximum systemic concentration is reached (Tmax) after a single injection 
of brolucizumab 6 mg. The study  design, study  duration, and patient population we re assess ed 
as adequate to meet the agency ’s request. The study is NOT a thorough QT study. The patient 
population is described in Section 5 Population below . 
Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are not expected to directly inhibit the function of 
ion channels responsible for cardiac repolarization ;therefore ,thorough QT studies are generally 
not required for biotherapeutics (Malik et al 2 010). There are no known preclinical 
cardiovascular safet y signals with b rolucizumab . T he systemic exposure was confirmed to be
very low in human with a median AUCinf ( Area under the concentration- time curve from time 
zero to infinity ) of 5580 ng*h/mL (Investigator’s Brochure) . 
Approximately  1 h before a single injection of brolucizumab, a Holter monitor will provide 
continuous ECG monitoring for 48h; capturing the approximate time at which maximum 
systemic concentra tion is reached (median Tmax was approximately  [ADDRESS_349942] dose). 
Asingle injection is deemed sufficient because it was previously  shown in the RTH258A2201 
study  thatbrolucizumab does not accumulate in the systemic circulation after repeated monthl y 
injections (SHRI KE, RTH258E003) . 
Additionally  long-term ECG data is being collected in an ongoing large Phase III study  of 
brolucizumab [ADDRESS_349943] treatment with brolucizumab 3mg, 6mg or aflibercept .

4.2 Rationale for dose/regimen and duration of treatment
The dose and regimen for brolucizumab are based on the following considerations:
Brolucizumab is well tolerated at a dose of 6 mg, based on the previous clinical Phase III 
program in which 1088 patients with nAMD received brolucizumab.
Brolucizumab [ADDRESS_349944] dose that has been tested. 
Brolucizumab 6 mg provides the higher s ystemic exposure after IVT injection as 
compared to the different dose strengths previously  investigated in patients and is foreseen 
as the therapeut ic dose . Thus, the proposed dose and route are appropriate to generate 
ECG data in its target population with brolucizumab.
4.3 Rationale for choice of control drugs
Not applicable. 
4.4 Purpose and timing of interim analy ses/design adaptations
Not applicable.
4.5 Risks and benefits
Intravitreal brolucizumab 6 mg has been administered to 1355 patient swith nAMD for up to 
2years treatment . Further details of the known and potential risks and benefits associated with 
brolucizumab are presented in the RTH258/brolucizumab Investigator’s Brochure.
All intravitreal injection procedures carry  the risk of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, 
vitreous or retinal hemorrhage, cataract, elevated intraocular pressure, and ocular inflammation. 
These cond itions are apparent on eye exam and most cause symptoms that prompt the patient
to seek immediate evaluation. With respect to endophthalmitis, current best clinical practices 
are used to reduce the risk of endophthalmitis. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_286810], endophthalmitis rates 
may approxima te 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 20,000.
As with any antibody , brolucizumab may carry the risk of anaphy laxis or hypersensitivity 
reacti ons and may also elicit the formation of human anti-drug antibodies ( ADA).
The risk to patient s in this trial may be minimized by [CONTACT_5345], as well as close clinical monitoring.
4.5.1 Blood sample volume
Approximately 6 mL of blood is planned to be collected over a period of up to 14days 
(during Screening ), from each patient as part of study screening . Additional samples may be 
required for safet y monitoring.
The timing of blood sample collection isoutlined in the Assessment Schedule ( Table 8-1).

8.1 Screening
Patients will be screened for eligibility  for up to 14 days prior to the Baseline visit. It is 
permissible to re-screen a patient if s/he fails the initial screening; however, each must be 
discussed and agreed with by[CONTACT_17190] a case-by-case basis. Information on what data 
must be collected for screening failures and further information on re-screening is outlined in 
the Site Operations Manual.
In the case where a safet y laboratory  assessment at screening indicates an electroly te imbalance, 
the invest igator should investigate if the electrol yte disturbance isdue to a chronic underl ying 
disease or if is the sequela of an intercurrent illness (e.g. such as vomiting ordiarrhea due to a 
recent stomach virus or flu) . If the electrolyte imbalance is due to a chronic underlying disease, 
then the patient must be excluded. If the electrol yte imbalance is due to an intercurrent illness 
and the investigator believes the intercurrent illness has adequatel y resolved, then the
investigator may repeat the testonce prior to treatment . If the repeat value remains outside of 
the specified ranges, the patient must be excluded from the study .
8.1.[ADDRESS_349956] demographics/other baseline characteristics
Patient demographic and baseline characteristic data are to be collected on all patient s. 
Relevant medical history /current medical condition present before signing the informed consent 
will be recorded. Investigators will have the discretion to record abnormal test findings on the 
appropriate CRF whenever ,in their judgment, the test abnormality  occurred prior to the 
informed consent signature. Details are outlined in the Site Operations Manual. 
8.3 Efficacy
Efficacy  / Pharmacod ynamics are not measured in this study .
8.4 Safet y
Safety  assessments are specified below with the assessment schedule detailing when each 
assessment is to be performed. For details on adverse event (AE )collection and reporting, refer 
to the AE section (Section 10.1.1). The methods, assessment, specification, and recording for 
each assessment will be detailed in the SOM.

Vital signs Vital signs include BP (systolic and diastolic pressure in mmHg) and pulse rate 
(beats per minute) measurements (see SOM Section 3.2 Vital signs for details) . 
In case there is an elevated blood pressure measurement as specified in the 
exclusion criteria, at the screening and baseline visits, the blood pressure 
measurement may be repeated up to two times within [ADDRESS_349958] 
measurement (i.e. [ADDRESS_349959] 
measurement ). If the final repeat measurement is elevated, then the patient is 
not eligible to be enrolled into the study.
If the case there is an out of range heart rateat screening andbaseline, two 
additional repeat readings can be obtained, so that a total of up to three 
consecutive assessments are made, with the subject seated quietly for 
approximately five minutes preceding each repeat assessment. The last 
reading must be within the ranges provided in the eligibility criteria in order for 
the subject to qualify.
On Day 1, vital signs will be measured before the administration of study  
medication. The res ults are rec orded in the eCRF.
Ophthalmic Exam Intraocular Pressure (IOP), Biomi croscopy (slit lamp examination), 
Ophthalmoscopy (funduscopy) will be performed (see protocol Section 8 .4.4

8.4.2 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Full details of all procedures relating to the ECG collection and reporting are contained in the
core reading center technical manual and in the Site Operations Manual .
Triplic ate 12 lead ECGs (performed at Screening, B aseline pre-injection , and Day 3) and [ADDRESS_349962] be reported as adverse 
events.
The Holter ECG recording is performed to capture comprehensive ECG data and should start 
approximately  onehour before IVT injection . The recording will end approximately  48 h after 
injection.
In the event that a clinically  significant ECG abnormality  is identified at the site (e.g. severe 
arrhythmia, conduction abnormality of QTcF > 500 ms), a copy of the assessment is sent to the 
core laboratory  for expedited review if applicable, and the ECG is r epeated to confirm the diagnosis.
If the patient is hemody namically  compromised, the investigator or a medically qualified person must 
initiate appropriate safety  procedures without delay  (for example cardioversion ).
Clinically  significant abnormalities must be recorded on the eCRF as either medical 
history /current medical conditions or adverse events as appropriate.
8.4.[ADDRESS_349963] pregnancy  testing at 
Screening . Additional pregnancy  testing might be performed if requested by [CONTACT_5277].
Local pregnancy  testing and associated results will not be collected on the e CRF.
Highl y effective contraception is required for women of child- bearing potential during the study 
drug administration and for 3 months after the investigational medication is administered.
8.4.4 Ophthalmic examination
The ophthalmic exam ination (including IOP, Biomicroscop y, and Ophthalmoscopy ) will be 
performed at Screening and Baseline (pre-dose and post -dose) as noted below:
Intraocular pressure (IOP) – IOP will be measured in mmHg and entered in the eCRF.
Screening: IOP is assessed in both ey es(OU) at Screening.
Baseline: IOP is assessed in the study  eye (SE) ONLY; pre -dose and post -dose 
measurements are required at Baseline.
Post-dose I OP should be assessed, approximately  30 -60 minutes after the IVT 
injection and, if ≥ 25 mmHg, the assessment should be repeated until back to normal . 
Treatment and close mo nitoring of an elevated IOP should be performed by  [CONTACT_286822] 29
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CRTH258A2309
Biomicroscopy (slit lamp examination) –The slit lamp examination will be completed 
to examine the structures of the study  eye. The results of the examination must be 
recorded in the source documents.
Screening: Biomicroscopy  is assessed in both ey es(OU).
Baseline: Biomicroscop y is assessed in the study eye (SE) ONLY; pre -dose and , if 
required, post dose examination s.
Ophthalmoscopy (funduscopy) – Ophthalmoscopy  will be completed to examine the 
peripheral retina and confirm that an intravitreal injection can be safely performed. 
Theresults of the examination must be recorded in the source documents.
Screening: Ophthalmoscopy  is assessed in both ey es(OU) at Screening.
Baseline: Ophthalmoscopy  is assessed in the study  eye (SE) ONLY; pre -dose and, if 
required, post -dose examinations 
Note: Pupil dilation for the slit lamp examination and ophthalmoscopy  is optional according to 
local practice. 
Clinically  significant abnormal findings (as judged by  [CONTACT_286823]) from slit lamp 
or ophthalmoscopy  observations should be recorded as an AE in the eCRF.
8.4.[ADDRESS_349964] ECG intervals and morphology  variables wi ll be assessed, and QTcF and QTcB will 
be calculated. Cardiac assessments will be based on the QTcF, although QTcB will be used for 
comparative and historical control. ECG data is collected at several time points (Screening, 
Baseline and then continuously between Baseline 1h pre -injection through 48h , and on Day 3).
It is appropriate to explore the within -and between -patient exposure -effect relationship.
Laboratory  samples will be drawn at Screening in order to identify  a  potential electrol yte 
imbalance (e .g. hy pokalemia) that might affect ECG parameters and morphology .
The other safet y assessments selected are standard for this indication/ patient population.
8.5 Additional assessments
No additional tests will be performed on patient s entered into this study .

Patient s will not be replaced on study . However, if a patient is conside red as non-evaluable , 
enrollment of a new patient will be considered by [CONTACT_286824] t he study . 
9.1.2 Withdrawal of informed consent
Patient s may voluntaril y withdraw consent to participate in the study  for any reason at any time. 
Withdrawal of consent occurs onl y when a patient :
Does not want to participate in the study  anymore, and
Does not allow further collection of personal data
In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) 
to understand the primary reason for the patient ’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and 
record this informati on.
Study  treatment must not be given (if not yet injected) and no further assessments conducted, 
and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing.
Further attempts to contact [CONTACT_286787] -up.
All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study  withdrawal. A final 
evaluation at the time of the patient ’s study  withdrawal should be made as detailed in the 
Assessment Schedule (Table 8 -1).
[COMPANY_001] will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data resulting from 
the analy sis of a patient ’s samples until the time of withdrawal) according to applicable law.

10.1 Definition of adverse events and reporting requirements
10.1.1 Adverse events
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory  findings], symptom or disease) in a patient or 
clinical investigation patient after providing written informed consent for participation in the 
study . Therefore, an AE may  or may  not be temporally  or causall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product.
The investigator has the responsibility  for managing the safet y of the individ ual patient and 
identify ing adverse events.
[COMPANY_001] qualified medical personnel will be readily  available to advise on trial related medical 
questions or problems.
The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by [CONTACT_105] -directive questioning of the patient at 
each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered b y 
the patient during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory  test 
findings, or other assessments.
Adverse events must be recorded under the signs, symptoms, or diagnosis associated with them, 
accompanied by [CONTACT_6644] (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to
Section 10.1.2 Serious adverse events):
1.The severit y grade:
mild: usually  transient in nature and generally  not interfering with normal activities
moderate: sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal activities
severe: prevents normal activities
2. Its rela tionship to the study  treatment .If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression 
of underl ying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) the assessment of causality 
will usually  be ‘Not suspected.’ The rationale for this guidance is that the symptoms of a 
lack of efficacy or progression of underl ying illness are not caused by [CONTACT_6645], they 
happen in spi[INVESTIGATOR_6532]/or both lack of efficacy  and progression of 
underly ing disease can only be evaluated meaningfull y by [CONTACT_6646], not on a 
single patient
3. Its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing, an outcome of not recovered/not 
resolved must be reported
4. W hether it constitutes anSAE (see Section 10.1.2 Serious adverse events for definition of 
SAE) and which seriousness criteria have been met
5. A ction taken regarding with study  treatment
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 33
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CRTH258A2309
All adverse events must be treated appropriately . Treatment may include one or more of the 
following:
Dose not changed
Dose reduced/incre ased
Drug interrupted/withdrawn
6. Its outcome
Conditions that were alread y present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in 
medical history  of the patient.
Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underly ing signs and s ymptoms.
Adverse event monitoring should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_349969] be followed unt il its resolution or until it is judged to 
be permanent (e.g. continuing at the end of the study ), and assessment must be made at each 
visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of an y changes in severity, the suspected relationship to 
the interventions requ ired to treat it, and the outcome.
Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the 
Investigator ’sBrochure (IB).
Abnormal laboratory  values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least 
one of the following criteria:
they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms
they are considered clinically  significant
they require therapy
Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  values or test results must be identified through a 
review of values outside ofnormal ranges/clinically  notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typi[INVESTIGATOR_286813] s with 
the underl ying disease.
Follow the instructions found in the Site Operations Manual for data capture methodology 
regarding AE collection for patient s that fail screening.
10.1.2 Serious adverse events
An SAE is defined as any adverse event appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing)
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following 
criteria:
Fatal
Life-threatening
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically  might have 
caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the ICH-E2D Guidelines 2004 ).
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 34
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 00) Protocol No. CRTH258A2309
Results in persist ent or significant disability /incapacity
Constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]: 
Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication , not associated with 
any deterioration in condition 
Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to 
the indication under study  and has not worsened since signing the information 
consent
Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_5316]’s 
general condition
Treatment on an emergency  outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any  of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]
Is medicall y significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situati ons should 
be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18534]. Such events should be 
considered as “medicall y significant”. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_286814] (please refer to the 
ICH-E2D Guidelines 2004 ).
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically  significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met and the malignant neoplasm is not a disease progression of the 
study  indication.
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.
All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse 
event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_349970] be 
reported to [COMPANY_001] safety  within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Detailed instructions 
regarding the submission process and r equirements are provided to each site.
Screen failures ( e.g.a patient who is screened but is not treated)
SAEs occurring after the patient has provided informed consent until the time the patient is 
deemed a Screen Failure must be reported to [COMPANY_001].

Treated Patients
SAEs collected between time patient signs ICF until [ADDRESS_349971] be reported separatel y as a new event.
If the SAE is not previously  documented in the Investiga tor’s Brochure (new occurrence) and 
is thought to be related to the study  treatment, a CMO & PS Department associate may urgentl y 
require further information from the investigator for health authorit y reporting. [COMPANY_001] may 
need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in an y stud y 
with the same study  treatment that this SAE has been reported.
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to 
the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 
2011/C 172/[ADDRESS_349972] be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy 
should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary  termination, 
details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any  birth defects, congenital abnormalities, 
or maternal and/or newborn complications.
Pregnancy  should be recorded and reported by [CONTACT_37288]  (CMO&PS). Pregnancy  follow -up should be recorded on the same 
form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the investigational 
treatment of any pregnancy  outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy  must be reported.
10.1.5 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse
Study  treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be recorded on 
the appropriate CRF irrespective of whether or not it is associated with an AE/SAE and reported 
to Safety  (only if associated with an SAE ). 
Misuse or abuse will be collected and reported in the safet y database irrespective of it being 
associated with an AE/SAE within 24 hours of Investigator’s awareness.

Schedule ( Table 8 -1) and can be recorded directl y on the CRFs. All other data captured for this 
study  wi ll have an external originating source (either written or electronic) with the CRF not 
being considered as source .
All data should be recorded, handled and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, 
interpretation and verification.
Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_286825] (eCRF). The eCRFs are built using fully  validated secure web -enabled software 
that conforms to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. Automatic validation programs check for data 
discrepancies in the eCRFs, allow modification and/or verification of the entered data by [CONTACT_286826]. Investigator site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they 
have bee n trained. 
The investigator/designee is responsi ble for assuring that the data recorded on CRFs (entered 
into eCRF) is complete, accurate, and that entry  and updates are performed in a timely  manner. 
The Investigator must c ertify  that the data entered is complete and accurate .

11.2 Database management and quality  control
[COMPANY_001] personnel (or designated CRO) will review the data entered by [CONTACT_49432] . Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and 
requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values. Queries aresent 
to the investigational site via the EDC s ystem. Designated investigator site staff are required to 
respond promptly  to queries and to make any  necessary  changes to the data.
Concomitant treatments and prior medications entered into the database will be coded using the 
WHO Drug Reference List, which employ s the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification 
system. Medical history /current medical conditions and ad verse events will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) terminology .
Once all of the necessary  actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be 
complete and accurate, it will be locked and made availab le for data analy sis/moved to restricted 
area to be accessed by[CONTACT_286827]. Any changes to the 
database after that time can only be made after written agreement by [CONTACT_49434].
11.3 Site monitoring
Before study initiation, ata site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a [COMPANY_001] or 
delegated CRO representative will review the protocol and data capture requirements 
(i.e.eCRFs) with the investigators and their staff. During the study , [COMPANY_001] employ s several 
methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality /integrity  of the sites’ data. 
The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy  
of data capture / data entry , the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the 
progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and 
accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the 
field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be 
performed by a  centralized [COMPANY_001] or delegated CRO /CRA organization. Additionally , a 
central analytics organization may analyze data & identify  risks & trends for site operational 
parameters, and provide reports to [COMPANY_001] clinical teams to assist with trial oversight.
The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study , consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the 
patient ’s file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed b y the 
patient (a signed cop y is given to the patient).
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their 
consistency  with the data capture and/or data entry . [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require full 
verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criter ia, 
documentation of SAEs and of data that will be used for all primary  variables. Additional checks 
of the consistency  of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -
specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity  of the patient s 
will be disclosed.

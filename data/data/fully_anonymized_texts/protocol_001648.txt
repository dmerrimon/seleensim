Protocol Title  
A Phase 1/2 Study of In Situ Vaccination with  Tremelimumab and IV Durvalumab  (MEDI4736)  
Plus the Toll-like Receptor Agonist PolyICLC in Subjects  with Advanced, Measurable , Biopsy -
accessible Cancers  
 
Objectives and Synopsis  
This is an open -label, multicenter , Phase 1/2 study of  the CTLA -4 antibody , tremelimumab , 
and the PD -L1 antibody , durvalumab  (MEDI4736) , in combination with the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) modulator polyICLC, a TLR3 agonist, in subjects with advanced, 
measurab le, biopsy -accessible cancers.  Subjects will receive intratumoral and intramuscular 
(IM)  administration of polyICLC and intravenous ( IV) administration of durvalumab , together 
with either IV or intratumoral administration of tremelimumab .  The study will be conducted 
in 2 phases.  
Phase 1 Cohorts:  There will be enrollmen t to [ADDRESS_604000]  cohorts  in Phase 1 , with staggered 
initiation of enrollment.   
• Cohort 1A : IV Durvalumab + intratumoral /IM polyICLC.   After safety is demonstrated in the 
first [ADDRESS_604001] s in Cohort 1A, Cohort s 1B and 1C  will open to enrollment.  
• Cohort 1B: IV Durvalumab  + IV Tremelimumab + intratumoral/IM  polyICLC. 
• Cohort 1C: IV Durvalumab + intratumoral Tremelimumab + intratumoral /IM polyICLC . 
Dose de -escalations for determination of the recommended combination doses (RCDs)  
through the  assessment of dose -limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) will be performed based on the dose 
levels  in the table below  and respective standard 3 + 3 rules .

1.1 Biopsy -accessible Advanced, Measurable Cancers  
The eligible disease types for this study were selected for inclusion based either on their ability 
to be accessed through  biopsy  (as defined in Section 5.1 ) and/or  on their viral etiologies (i.e., 
non-viral- associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [HNSCC] and Merkel cell 
carcinoma [MCC] ). 
1.1.1 Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma  
The incidence of HNSCC is  45,000 cases  per year, with a mortality of > 12,[ADDRESS_604015] s per year.  
While viral- associated HNSCC is associated with 80% overall survival (OS) following treatment, 
recurrence rates remain high in n on-viral- associated HNSCC , despi[INVESTIGATOR_471336], chemotherapy , and radiation.   Up to 50% of non -viral-associated cases may  present 
with advanced disease, in which  the likelihood of complete resection decreases .  Subject s with 
unresectable tumors have been selected for eligibility in this study because of the acc essibility of 
the lesions, indications of some responses to immunotherapy, and usual progression and 
regional disfigurement despi[INVESTIGATOR_360365] . 
1.1.[ADDRESS_604016] cancer has a high rate of clinical response with hormonal therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and/or  trastuzumab .  However, a subset of patient s develops  recurrent breast cancer locally on 
the chest wall, which is accessible for biopsy, and may include skin, subcutaneous, or nodal metastases alone or in  addition to systemic disease.  Especially among patients with local 
recurrence within [ADDRESS_604017] -conserving surgery, the probability of survival is less than 
10% .(1) 
1.1.[ADDRESS_604018] 
systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Sarcomas available for biopsy and injection may be eligible for this study.  
1.1.4  Merkel Cell Carcinoma  
MCC is a malignancy arising from Merkel cells in the skin, which can be aggressive and 
unrespo nsive to systemic therapy.  MCC is responsive to radiation therapy, but systemic 
metastases are often lethal.  Approximately  80% of MCCs  are linked etiologically to the Merkel 
cell polyomavirus (MCV) .(2, 3)  MCC arises on the skin and often metastasizes to r egional or 
distant skin sites.  
1.1.5  Cutaneous T -cell Lymphoma  
The cutaneous T -cell lymphomas (CTCLs)  comprise a heterogeneous group o f T-cell 
lymphoproliferative disorders such as mycosis fungoides and S ézary syndromes.  Patients with 
advanced -stage disease with significant nodal, visceral , or blood involvement can be treated 
with biologic -response modifiers, HDAC inhibitors , and/or chemotherapy.  Patients refractory to

SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3 
LUD2014- 011 Protocol Amendment 6.0  (Final, 02-NOV -2021)  Page [ADDRESS_604019] responded to intratumoral CpG treatment, suggesting that TLR agonists may 
benefit these patients .(4) 
1.1.6  Metastatic  Melanoma  
Until recently, darcarbazine  (DTIC) and high -dose IL -2 were the only agents approved for use in 
the [LOCATION_002]  (US)  for the tre atment of metastatic melanoma.  Durable responses to 
high-dose IL -[ADDRESS_604020] been approved  by [CONTACT_471366] -mutant melanoma, and 
the CTLA -4 antibody ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Yervoy ®) and PD-1 antibodies pembrolizumab (Keytruda®)  and 
nivolumab (Opdivo®)  have been approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.  Benefits 
of high -dose IL -2, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] , and PD1 antibodies  are mediated d irectly or indirectly through 
T-cell activation; thus, they are proof- of-principle for the ability of T -cell- directed therapie s 
to control melanoma.  However, some patients will fail or be ineligible for all of these 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Melanoma often metastasizes to distant skin and regional sites, which are 
accessible for intralesional therapy and biopsies , and there have been reports of responses to 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_471337] (imiquimod) and intralesional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( IL-2, BCG,  and talimogene 
laherparepvec ). 
1.1.7  Genitourinary Cancers with Accessible Metastases ( Bladder, Renal , Prostate ) 
Breakthrough status has recently been given for anti -PD-L1 agents in advanced bladder cancers, 
and checkpoint blockade inhibition with other monoclonal antibodies is being actively tested in 
genitourinary ( GU) cancers.  Tumor infiltration with T cells  and responsiveness to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471338] -[ADDRESS_604021] effects in the TME.  Since these cancers are accessible for intralesional injection 
and biopsy, patients who  are refractory to other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , including checkpoint blockade 
inhibitor s, would be eligible for treatment.  
1.2 Toll -like Receptor : PolyICLC  
The toll-like receptors  (TLRs)  are a family  of pathogen  recognition  receptors  expressed broadly  
on hematopoietic cells  (e.g.,  myeloid  dendritic  cells  [mDC ], plasmacytoid  [pDC], monocytes, and 
B cells)  that recognize pathogen -associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), activate  innate  
immune  responses,  and facilitate  the development of  adaptive  responses.   The engagement of  
specific  TLRs  leads  to the activation  of different  cell populations  and the production of  distinct  
patterns  of cytokines and  other  inflammatory mediators,  resulting  in alternative  immune  
response  profiles.  
Polyinosinic -polycytidylic acid ( polyIC ) is a double -stranded RNA (dsRNA) that acts as a TLR3 
agonist.  However, its short half- life limits its usefulness.   To increase half- life and its practical 
use in the clinical setting, polyIC  has been stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose  
as polyICLC  (Hiltonol® , Oncovir Inc.) .  Like polyIC, polyICLC is a TLR3 agonist. TLR3 is expressed in 
the early endosome of myeloid DC; thus polyICLC preferentially activates myeloid dendritic cells, 
favoring a Th1 cytotoxic T -cell response .(5, 6)  PolyICLC also activates natural killer ( NK) cells and 
induces cytolytic potential .(6)  It has been administered intratumorally  in a sarcoma patient with  
dramatic clinical tumor regression .(7)  A clinical trial further testing intratumoral  polyICLC is 
underway ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3 
LUD2014- 011 Protocol Amendment 6.0  (Final, 02-NOV -2021)  Page 9 of 102 PolyICLC  is provided as a clinical grade reagent for experimental use in single -use vials 
containing 1 mL of approximately  2 mg/mL solution under contract from Oncovir to the Ludwig 
Institute for Cancer Research and  the Cancer Vaccine Consortium.  
PolyICLC  has been used safely in cancer patients, with  intravenous ( IV) doses up to 300 µ g/kg .(4)  
In this study, 1  mg of polyICLC will be administer ed per dose, as used in other trials (e.g. , 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) and as administered intr atumorally with clinical benefit  (7) 
(e.g., [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).  
1.3 CTLA -4 Antibody: Tremelimumab  
CTLA -4 (CD152) is constitutively expressed by T lymphocytes within the cytoplasm but is 
expressed  at the cell surface  upon antigen activation.  Its ligation on CD80 or CD86  down  
regulates the stimulatory signal of the T -cell receptor.  Blockade of CTLA -4 abrogates this 
negative signal, supporting T -cell activation and expansion.  Therapeutic blockade of CTLA -4 in 
murine models and in humans can lead to durable objective regressions of metastatic cancer.  
The mechanism also may be mediated in part by [CONTACT_38252] T cells.  One CTLA -4 
blocking antibody (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) has been approved by [CONTACT_471367].  The CTLA -4 blocking antibody in the present study (tremelimumab) has similar 
clinical activity but has not yet been approved for use in humans.  
Tremelimumab  is briefly de scribed in this section below.   Refer to the current Investigator’s 
Brochure for complete and current information.  
Tremelimumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig)G2 monoclonal  antibody (mAb) being 
investigated as a cancer immunotherapeutic agent.  Tremelimumab is  specific for human 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte -associated antigen 4 (CTLA -4; CD152), a cell  surface receptor that is 
expressed primarily on activated T cells and acts to inhibit their activation.  
As of the data cutoff date of 12Nov2014 (for all studies except D4190C00006 that has a 
cutoff date of 04De c2014), [ADDRESS_604022] received tremelimumab or placebo in the ongoing double -blinded, Phase 2b 
mesothelioma study, D4880C00003 (DETERMINE; data remain blinded). Tremelimumab in combination  with other anticancer agents has been administered to 208 subjects with a 
variety of tumor types in 12 of the 22 clinical studies, 7 of which are ongoing.
 
In clinical subjects, tremelimumab exhibits linear (dose -proportional) PK following IV 
infusion.  
Across the clinical development program for tremelimumab, a pattern of efficacy has emerged, also observed for the related anti -CTLA -4 antibody, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], which appears to 
be consistent across tumor types for this mechanism of action. In genera l, tumor r esponse 
rates to anti -CTLA -4 antibodies are generally low, approximately 10%. However, in subjects 
who respond, the responses are generally durable, lasting several months even in subjects with aggressive tumors such as refractory metastatic melanoma. Some subjects may have what is perceived to be progression of their disease in advance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_471339] -C01-TMP -3 version 3 
LUD2014- 011 Protocol Amendment 6.0  (Final, 02-NOV -2021)  Page [ADDRESS_604023] on conventionally -defined 
progression -free survival (PFS) can be small; however, the d urable response or stable 
disease seen in a proportion of subjects can lead to significant prolongation of overall 
survival (OS).  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_471340] - and second -line treatment of 
subjects with metastatic melanom a.  The melanoma data with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_471341] a small proportion of subject s with an objective response had significant prolongation of 
OS, supporting the development of this class of agents in other tumors.  Although Phase [ADDRESS_604024] activity of tremelimumab in 
melanoma. (8, 9)  In a large Phase 3 randomized study comparing tremelimumab with 
dacarbazine (DTIC)/temozolomide in subject s with advanced melanoma, the reported median 
OS in the final analysis was 12.58 months for tremelimumab versus 10.71  months for 
TIC/temozolomide (HR = 1.1416, p = 0.1272). (9) 
The profile of adverse events (AEs) and the spectrum of event severity have remained stable across the tremelimumab clinical program and are consistent with the pharmacology of the target. To date, no tumor type or stage appears to be associated with unique AEs (except for 
vitiligo that appears to be confined to subjects with melanoma).   As of the data cutoff date of 
12Nov2014 (for all studies except D4190C00006 that has a cutoff date of 04Dec2014), AEs (all grades, regardless of causality) report ed in > 10% of subjects in the completed and rollover 
tremelimumab monotherapy studies (N = 973, integrated data) were diarrhea (45.3%), fatigue (37.5%), nausea (32.5%), rash (28.8%), pruritus (27.3%), decreased appetite (22.8%), vomiting (22.5%), pyrexia (15.3%), cough (15.0%), constipation (14.4%), abdominal pain (13.9%), headache (13.8%), dyspnea (12.4%), and decreased weight (10.2%). Based on integrated data 
from completed studies of tremelimumab in combination with other agents (N = 116), AEs (all 
grad es, regardless of causality) reported in > 15% of subjects were diarrhea (54.3%); nausea 
(40.5%); fatigue (38.8%); rash (35.3%); pruritus, decreased appetite (30.2% each); vomiting 
(27.6%); pyrexia (26.7%); influenza like illness (20.7%); arthralgia (19.8% ); constipation (19.0%); 
thrombocytopenia, injection site reaction (18.1% each); and increased aspartate aminotransferase (15.5%). Most of these events occurred at a higher rate with tremelimumab plus sunitinib than with other combinations. The events of d iarrhea, rash, and pruritus are 
considered identified risks of tremelimumab. Acute renal failure was reported in subjects who received the combination of tremelimumab and sunitinib; however, acute renal failure has not been an expected AE for single -agent tremelimumab. The incidence and/or severity of many of 
the AEs observed following administration of tremelimumab can be reduced by [CONTACT_471368] -related toxicitie
s. 
Clinical studies of tremelimumab are ongoing in  several solid tumor types, including malignant 
mesothelioma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  
1.4 PD-L1 Antibody: Durvalumab (MEDI4736)  
Programmed d eath -1 (PD -1, CD279) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IGSF) of 
molecules involved in regulation of T cell activation.  PD-1 acquired its name ‘programmed 
death’ when it was identified in 1992 as a gene upregulated in T cell hybridoma undergoi ng cell 
death .(10)  The structure of PD -1 is composed of 1 IGSF domain, a transmembrane domain, and 
an intracellular domain containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibitory motif (ITIM)

partners: PD -L1 (B7 -H1, CD274) and PD -L2 (B7 -DC, CD273), distant relatives of the B7 -1 and B7 -2 
molecules.  PD-L1, discovered in 1 999, is expressed quite broadly, on both hematopoietic and 
non-hematopoietic lineages .(14-16)  It is found on T cells, B cells, macrophages, NK cells, DCs, 
and mast cells .(17)  It has also been described on peripheral tissues including cardiac 
endothelium, lung, small intestine, keratinocytes, islet cells of th e pancreas, and 
syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta as well as a variety of tumor cell types .(17-28)  PD-L1 is 
constitutively expressed on many hematopoietic cells, but may be upregulated in hematopoietic 
and non -hematopoietic cells .(29)  Regulation of PD -L1 is mediated, in part, by [CONTACT_24975] I and type II 
interferons.  PD-L2 was identified in 2001 .(30, 31)  Its expression is far more restricted and is 
confined  largely  to hematopoietic cells .(32)  However, PD -L2 is expressed on some pulmonary

Engagement of PD -1 on T cells in hibits activation , with downstream effects on cytokine 
production, proliferation, cell survival, and transcription factors associated with effector T cell function .(34-38)  Inhibitory signaling by [CONTACT_4002] -1 is thought to depend upon the cytosolic ITSM 
domain, which associates with phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2.(39, 40)  
Durvalumab  is briefly described in this se ction below.  Refer to the current Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB) for complete and current information.  
Durvalumab  is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody (MAb ) directed against 
human PD -L1.  Durvalumab  has an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa, includ ing 
N-linked oligosaccharides.  The antibody is composed of 2 identical heavy chains of 
approximately 49,670 Da each, and 2 identical light chains of approximately 23,390 Da each. The 
fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of durvalumab  contains a triple mutation in the constant 
domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the compleme nt component C1q and 
the Fcm receptors, responsible for mediating antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity 
(ADCC) .(41)  Subsequent to this triple mutation, the anticipated lack of durvalumab -mediated 
ADCC and complement -dependent cytotoxicity were confirmed using cell based functional 
assays. Durvalumab  is selective for recombinant PD -L1 and blocks the binding of recombinant  
PD-L1 to the PD -1 and cluster of differentiation (CD) 80 receptors.  
As of the data cutoff dates in the IB (15Apr2015 to 12Jul2015), a total of 1,[ADDRESS_604025] been enrolled and treated in 30 ongoing durvalumab  clinical studies, including 20 sponsored (6 
monotherapy and 14 combination therapy) and 10 collaborative studies. Of the 1,883 subjects, 1,279 received durvalumab  monotherapy, 440 received durvalumab  in combination with 
tremelimumab or other anticancer agents, 14 received other agents (1 gefitini b, 13 MEDI6383), 
and [ADDRESS_604026] ent with the pharmacology of the target and other agents in the immune checkpoint 
inhibitor class. No tumor types appeared to be associated with unique AEs. Immune -related AEs 
(irAEs), which are important risks of immune checkpoint inhibitors,  have been ob served with 
durvalumab  and include colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis/hepatotoxicity, neuropathy / 
neuromuscular toxicity, endocrinopathy, dermatitis, and nephritis. In addition, pancreatitis is an important potential risk particularly with durvalumab  and tre melimumab combination therapy.

LUD2014- 011 Protocol Amendment 6.0  (Final, 02-NOV -2021)  Page 13 of 102 2 Study Rationale  
Recent studies indicate that local ( intratumoral) delivery of monoclonal antibodies (including 
anti-CTLA -4 therapy ) in mi ce stimulates equivalent immune responses while limiting the 
autoimmune toxicity often observed with systemic administration of these agents .(42, 43)  An 
ongoing clinical study of intratumoral ipi[INVESTIGATOR_471343]-101 (a toll- like receptor [ADDRESS_604027]) and local radiation is currently investigating the safety and efficacy of this technique in 
subject s with low -grade B- cell lymphomas (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
The current  study will implement intratumoral administration of tremelimumab , and 
hypothesizes that (1)  the combination of intratumoral  and systemic therapy  with check point 
blockade agents and polyICLC will be safe, (2) the combination of intratumoral and systemic 
therapy will induce clinical tumor responses in cancers that do not respond well to systemic 
checkpoint blockade alone, ( 3) the combination regimen will induc e systemic antitumor T -cell 
and antibody responses, including responses to autologous tumor antigens, and ( 4) the 
combination regimen will induce immune signatures in the treated tumors, with upregulation of IFNγ, PD -L1 expression, T -cell recruiting chemokines, and T -cell infiltrates.  
According to Med immune, the combination dose selection of 1 mg/kg Q4W for trem elimumab 
and 20 mg/kg Q4W for durvalumab  was based on the identification of an optimal dose of 
durvalumab  that would “yield sustained target suppression, optimize synergy of the 
combination, while maintaining the balance of safety in combination with treme limumab.”  This 
is consistent with the dosing  regimen to be evaluated in the Med immune program going 
forward.  
The fixed dosing is based on information  from Med immune , which  indicates that the dose and 
schedule of [ADDRESS_604028] variability with fixed dosing regimens.  A fixed 
dosing approach is preferred by [CONTACT_118424]. Given expectation of similar PK exposure and variability, Med immune considers  it 
feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens. Based on an average body weight of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 750 mg Q2W durvalumab  is equivalent to 10 mg/kg Q2W, 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab  is 
equivalent  to 20 mg/kg Q4W, and 75 mg Q4W tremelimumab is equivalent t o 1 mg/kg Q4W.   
The 1500 mg Q4W dosing  of durvalumab is recommended only for subjects with >  30 kg body 
weight  in order to limit endotoxin exposure.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for details regarding 
durvalumab dose requirements for instances when a subject’s body weight drops to ≤ 30 kg 
while on the study .  
See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for additional details regarding the dose de -escalation cohorts for 
durvalumab and tremelimumab.

3.1 Study Design  
This is an open -label, multicenter , Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the CTLA -4 antibody , 
tremelimumab , and the PD -L1 antibody , durvalumab , in combination with the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) modulator polyICLC , a TLR3 agonist,  in subject s with advanced, 
measurable, biopsy -accessible cancers  (as defined in Sect ion 5.1). 
Subjects will receive intratumoral and intramuscular (IM)  administration of polyICLC and 
intravenous ( IV) administration of durvalumab , together with either IV or intratumoral 
administration of tremelimumab .  The study will be conducted in [ADDRESS_604029]  cohorts  in Phase 1 , as described in Section 3.1.2 .   
Dose de -escalations for determination of the recommended combination doses (RCDs)  through 
the assessment of dose -limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) will be performed based on the available dose 
levels and respective standard 3 + 3 rules . 
Once determined, the RCD of the dosing regimen will then be expanded in the Phase 2 portion 
of the study .  If Cohort 1C is not cleared, the RCD of the previously cleared cohort will be used 
for Phase 2.

3.1.2  Enrollment/Randomization  
For Phase [ADDRESS_604030]  cohorts, with staggered initiation 
of enrollment :  
• Cohort 1A : IV Durvalumab  + intratumoral/IM  polyICLC.   
• Cohort 1B: IV Durvalumab  + IV Tremelimumab + intratumoral/IM  polyICLC.  
• Cohort 1C: IV Durvalumab  + intratumoral Tremelimumab + intratumoral /IM polyICLC . 
After safety is demonstrated in the first 3 -6 subjects in Cohort 1A, Cohorts 1B and 1C will open 
with alternating enrollment .   
For Phase 2 (Cohort 2), e nrollment will occur without randomization.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for

This study will be conducted at u p to 8  sites  in the US , with up to 102 subjects estimated for 
enrollment . 
Phase 1  will enroll up to 36 subjects to determine the RCDs of durvalumab or durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab within each cohort  (3-6 subjects per dose level for each of the 3 cohorts) . The 
RCD for each arm is defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 o f 6 subjects (i.e., 
< 33%) experience DLTs.  
Phase 2  will evaluate u p to 66 subjects treated with the RCDs of the dosing regimen.  
3.1.6  Sample Size and Statistical Considerations  
Phase 1 : The primary endpoint for  the Phase 1 portion of the study is safety. The objective for 
Phase 1  is to determine the recommended combination dose (RCD). In each of the Phase 1 
cohorts, a 3+3 design is used.  Each cohort will be  evaluated on its own.  The only modification 
to the design i s that the protocol evaluates up to 2 dose levels and starts at the desired dose 
level  (Level 0) . As only one drug is being modified in each c ohort, the principles of a 3+[ADDRESS_604032] dose leve l at which no more 
than 1 of 6 subjects experience DLTs.  
The Cohort 1A doublet (durvalumab + p olyICLC) will be enrolled first , starting at Level [ADDRESS_604033] s in the Cohort 1A  doublet , the Cohort 1B triplet (durvalumab + p olyICLC + IV 
tremelimumab) and the Cohort 1C  triplet  (durvalumab + p olyICLC + intratumoral tremelimumab) 
will open to enrollment.  
Based on the DLT assessment, th e starting dose Level [ADDRESS_604034] 3+3 design , 
whereby a dose level may be reduced as well as escalated based on the DLTs observed.  
The table  below  gives  the probabilit ies of de-escalation to dose  Level -1, based  on true DLT 
rate in the 3+3 design.

has been determined in Cohort 1C, up to 66 subsequent  subjects will be enrolled into the P hase 
2 cohort at  the RCD according to Cohort 1C. If Cohort 1C is not cleared, the RCD of the 
previous ly cleared cohort will be used for P hase 2.  
For the  Cohort 1A  doublet, if dose L evel -1 is too toxic, the RCD cannot be determined and the 
study will stop.  Otherwise, Cohorts 1B and 1C  triplets  will open in parallel at the doublet RCD of 
Cohort 1A, and the triplet RCD will be  determined in both Cohorts 1B and 1C.

SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3 
LUD2014- 011 Protocol Amendment 6.0  (Final, 02-NOV -2021)  Page 16 of 102 If no triplet RCD can be determined, Phase 2 of the study will be done at  the Cohort 1A doublet 
RCD .  If triplet RCDs are determined for both Cohorts 1B and 1C, the triplet RCD of Cohort 1C will 
be used in Phase 2 .  If a triplet RCD can only be determined in Cohort 1B, that triplet RCD will be 
used in Phase 2 . 
Phase 2 : The phase [ADDRESS_604036] s. 
Response is defined in this protocol as achieving a partial response (PR) or complete response 
(CR) by [CONTACT_44859] -related RECIST or RECIST 1.1, or stable disease (SD) for at least [ADDRESS_604037] been previou sly investigated in Phase 1 and 2 studies. Response 
rates range from 8% to 25% overall, and from 10% to 35% in the squamous subpopulation (44). 
This combination therapy trial seeks to improve on these response rates. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_471344] [ADDRESS_604038] s for each tumor type, results in a rejection rate 
of <20% if the true response rate for a particular tumor type is 25%. A total of (8)(6)= [ADDRESS_604039] s 
will be initially enrolled for the P hase 2 portion plus a potential additional (3)(6)= [ADDRESS_604040] one response in the initial group (tot al of 48+18= [ADDRESS_604041] s). 
For tumor types accruing 6+6= [ADDRESS_604042] 90% confidence interval for response rate 
will be computed.   
The safety of the regimen taken into Phase [ADDRESS_604043] been enrolled and treated in a disease cohort, a review of 
the data from the cohort will be conducted by [CONTACT_471369] a 
decision (based on efficacy as well as safety) will be made whether to expand the disease cohort 
to 12 subjects. At any time during the study , the Medical Monitor and/or the internal data 
safety monitoring panel  may stop the cohort or the study if t he toxicity seen is not acceptable.  
Respective study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_48946] 3.1.[ADDRESS_604044] a DLT, then 
accrual to that disease type cohort will be terminated.  
The expansion phase sample size of 66 subjects is deemed to be sufficient for the assessment of 
safety and tolerability as it provides sufficient precision for estimation of adverse events.   The 
confidence intervals (CI) for estimating the incidence of AEs ranging from 10% to 90% (in increments of 10%) are listed below.   The margins of error (half width of the CI) are deemed 
acceptable for the estimation  of AE incidences in this early phase trial.

3.1.7  Treatment Arms  and Treatment Schema  
Table 1 presents the schedule of treatment administr ation  within each 28 -day cycle . 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  (Phase 1) , Table 2 and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] (Phase 2) describe further details regarding 
study drug adminis tration within each phase. See Section 6 for the sequence of drug 
administration on dosing days when multiple drugs are given.  
NOTE: For each subject, there will be  one allowed delay of up to one week for a scheduled visit; 
however , the delay can only occur after Cycle 1 is complete.   Starting with Cycle 5, the intervals 
for visit days will change to ±7 days; however, a [ADDRESS_604045] be maintained between 
durv alumab  doses  (See Flowchart in Section 3.2 ). 
• Intratumoral  administration  
The intratumoral dose of tremelimumab was based on  approximately 10% of the systemic 
dose , utilizing a fixed  dose of 10 mg (with a de -escalation dose of 3 mg) for this study,  given 
for 4 cycles .  The intratumoral tremelimumab  and intratumoral polyICLC  will be 
administe red according to the schema in Table 1 and Table 2 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for volume 
of tremelimumab dose) .   
A 7-day dosing window is permitted for polyICLC  dosing provided that all intratumoral 
injections are administered within the first [ADDRESS_604046] 24 hours apart. One delay of dosing exceeding specified dosing 
windows  may also be permitted for reasons other than toxicity (e. g., scheduling conflict , 
severe weather affecting travel ). 
The total volume of study drug to be injected  intratumorally  should be administered to a 
single tumor if possible, but may be delivered to a maximum of 3 smaller tumors  if 
necessary.  Tumor (s) selected for injection must be identified at Baseline (pre -injection), 
including the volume of  study drug to be administered, and the selected tumor (s) must be 
treated with this  assigned volume for the duration of the study . 
• Systemic administration will be  delivered in accordance with the dose  de-escalation schema 
(see Table 2) to determine the RCDs .  The treatment schema in Table 1 will be followed for 
all cohorts.  Following completion of intratumoral dosing in Cycle 1 and throughout Cycle 2, 
polyICLC will be administered at a  dose of 1  mg IM  twice weekly .  During Cycle 3, polyICLC  
will be administered on Days 1 and 4 and will be discontinued  thereafter .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase 2: Expansion Phase  
Once the RC D of the triplet dosing regimen has been determined  in Cohort 1C, subsequent  
subject s will be enrolled  into Cohort 2 to receive the RCDs of both checkpoint antibodies in 
combination with polyICLC , according to the treatment schema in Table 1.  Up to 66 evaluable

cohort will be used for Phase 2.  
Cohort 2 will expand the c ohort that was treated at the RCD  from the dose- finding phase .  Up to 
6 subjects per tumor type will be initially enroll ed into Cohort 2.  Data from all subjects who are 
treated with the dosing regimen in either the cleared dose- finding cohort  or Cohort 2 will be

3.1.9   Dose -limiting Toxicity  
DLTs will be asse ssed for the period from Day 1 of the study up to and including the Week 7,  
Cycle 2/ Day 15 study visit; this is  defined as the “DLT Evaluation Period” for each subject in 
Cohorts 1A through 1 C.  The decisions for dose de -escalations and RCD, as described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS], will be based primarily on the number of subjects with DLTs occurring during the DLT 
Evaluation Period.  DLTs occurring outside the DLT Evaluation Period will also be evaluated and 
may impac t such decisions.  
DLTs are defined as any adverse events that  are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the 
administration of tremelimumab, durvalumab , and/or polyICLC  and fulfill any of the following 
criteria:  
1. Any Grade ≥ 3 colitis , pneumonitis , neurological event, or uveitis.  
2. Any Grade 2 pneumonitis, neurological event, or uveitis  with the following exception : 
• Grade 2 pneumonitis , neurological event, or uveitis  that downgrades to Grade ≤ 1 
within 3 days after onset, whereby [CONTACT_218427],  including systemic 
corticosteroids, is permitted.  
3. Any other  Grade ≥ 3 toxicity, with the following exceptions : 
• Grade 3 irAEs (see definition below) that downgrade to Grade ≤ 2 within 3 days, or 
to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline within 14 days after onset, whereby [CONTACT_218428], including systemic corticosteroids, is permitted.  
• Grade 3 endocrinopathy  that becomes asymptomatic  when  managed with or 
without systemic corticosteroid therapy and/or hormone replacement therapy.  
• Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response (e.g., 
inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc.).  
• Grade 3 fat igue for ≤ 7days.  
• Grade 3 infusion -related reaction (first occurrence and in the absence of steroid 
prophylaxis) that resolves within 6 hours with appropriate clinical management.

• Grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic increases in amylase or lipase levels for which 
appropriate evaluation shows no clinical evidence of pancreatitis . 
IrAEs are defined as adverse events ( AEs) of immune nature (i.e., inflammatory) in the absence 
of a clear alternative etiology. I n the absence of clinical abnormality, repeat laborato ry testing 
will be conducted to confirm significant laboratory findings prior to designation as a DLT.

best interest of the subject, the I nvestigator and S ponsor may agree to continue treatment, 
possibly at a lower dose  level.  
Maximum tolerated doses (M TDs) will not be determined. Instead, RCDs will be determined in 
the context of the predefined d ose levels used during the dose  de-escalation phase as per 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].   
3.1.[ADDRESS_604062]  will be withdrawn from study treatment  for any of the following reasons : 
1. Withdrawal of consent for further treatment  
2. Pregnancy or i ntent to become pregnant.

chemistry parameter, descriptive statistics will be presented for the changes f rom baseline to 
each post -treatment assessment time point.   Descriptive statistics will be presented for the 
changes in vital signs from baseline to each post -treatment assessment time point.    
4.2 Clinical Efficacy  
4.2.1  Endpoints and  Assessment Methods  
Clinical efficacy will be  determined by [CONTACT_20363] (ORR), p rogression -free survival 
(PFS), and overall survival (OS).  Disease assessments will be done in accordance with the 
flowchart in Section 3.2.  Subsequent imaging at [ADDRESS_604081] be performed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Objective Response Rate  
The primary method of assessment of response and ORR  will be irRECIST (see Section  8.5) and 
the secondary method will be RECIST  1.1, modified for the tumor biopsies  such  that tumors 
biopsied during the study will not be considered measurable for ORR  but will be assessed as 
non-measurable lesions to the extent that marked progression of a non -measurable lesion is 
inconsistent with an objective response ; these lesions will be identified prospectively prior to 
the first treatment.   ORR is defined as the percentage of evaluable  subject s meeting criteria of 
CR or PR , confirmed at a subsequent time point (≥ 4 weeks) . Disease control is defined as SD  for 
6 months , PR, or CR.   Every attempt should be made to use whichever imaging techniqu e(s) and 
test(s) are used initially for repeat evaluations throughout the study, whereby [CONTACT_471375] 4 weeks from the prior assessment.  Regression of treated 
and untreated tumors will be recorded separately and track ed as well.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Progression -free Survival  
Progression -free survival will be defined as the number of days from the date of first dose of 
study drug to the date of earliest disease progression based on irRECIST , or to the date of death, 
if disease progression d oes not occur.   PFS based on RECIST 1.1 will also be recorded but will not 
be the primary endpoint.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overall Survival  
OS will be measured for each subject  from the date of first dose of study drug  until the recorded 
date of death or last follow -up.  Subjects who are  still alive will be censored on  the date of last 
follow -up.  Every effort will be made to follow subject s for OS after they discontinue the study.  
NOTE: Per Amendment 6.0, all post study follow -up for the collection of survival data will b e 
discontinued as of 28 February 2022 (see rationale in Section 8.1 , Amendment 6.0 on Page 80 ).

LUD2014- 011 Protocol Amendment 6.0  (Final, 02-NOV -2021)  Page [ADDRESS_604082]  Evaluation and  Statistics  
The analysis of clinical efficacy  will be based on both the intent -to-treat (ITT) and the PP 
population  for Clinical Efficacy .  Subject s who receive at least [ADDRESS_604083] s who are fully evaluable per protocol , as defined in 
Section 3.1.11 , will be included in the PP population  for Clinical Efficacy . 
4.3 Biological Activity  
4.3.1  Endpoints and  Assessment Methods  
Correlative data will be obtained to assess the effects of the dosing regimen  on the TME , 
including P D-L1 expression  (baseline by [CONTACT_44847], changes over time during and after 
intratumoral therapy ), T-cell infiltration , chemokine profiles, i mmune gene signatures, TLR 
signaling , and m arkers of immunogenic cell death (LC3, intact ER stress response, HMGB1).  
Any observed effects will also be assessed to determine whether these changes (or baseline 
levels) may predict clinical response to combination therapy, including blockade of PD -L1 and 
CTLA -4. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Microenvironment  
Tumor  biopsies will be conducted on all subjects at Baseline ( pretreatment) , Day 15, and, 
provided there is sufficient tumor to biopsy, at Day 29  (Cycle 2, Day 1) , and optionally at the 
time of progression and at the end of treatment .  Subjects must have adequate tissue available 
as outlined in the inclusion criteria (Section 5.1). Biopsies will be obtained via incisional, 
excisional, or core biopsies. Additional biopsies may be obtained as appropriate.  These biopsies 
will be prepared in 3  conditions: formalin -fixed tissue, quick -frozen tissue, and RNA later® . In 
subjects with large biopsies, viable cell suspensions may be collected and prepared as single -cell 
suspensions and viably  cryopreserved.   Endpoints include induction of a favorable i mmune

One syringe should be filled aseptically from 1 vial for each dose.   
The intratumoral injections will be administered by a physician or nurse under physician 
supervision . For particularly large lesions (>  [ADDRESS_604111] diameter), the dose  can be divided 
and administered into more than [ADDRESS_604112] lesions, the 
needle can be moved within each quadrant of the lesion, or if the lesion is too large , separate 
injections will be given for the total dose  (to cover more of the lesion ). During injections , it is 
recommended that the investigator distribute the injectate throughout the lesion targeted. If 
the injected lesion regresses completely before all of the intratumoral  injections are 
administered, no further intratumoral injections will be given . Alternat ively, if the lesion is too 
small to inject the complete volume of intratumoral study drug, the dose may be divided among 
a maximum of [ADDRESS_604113](s). Fully functional resuscitation facilities 
should be available.  
The subject s will be monitored before and for at least 1 hour after the intratumoral injections , 
including a determination of temperature, blood pressure, heart rat e, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] . 
The total time between needle puncture  of the tremelimumab vial to start of administration 
should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature , or 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  If 
tremelimumab  administration has to be delayed, a  new dose must be prepared from new vials.  
Tremelimumab  does not contain preservatives, and any unused portion must be discarded.

polyvinylidine fluoride DRF (PVDF).  
• Syringes made of polypropylene and latex -free.  
• Needles made of stainless steel.  
 
Preparation of tremelimumab and pre paration of the IV bag are to be performed aseptically by 
[CONTACT_471381]. No incompatibilities between tremelimumab and 
polyvinylchloride or polyolefin have been observed.  
Tremelimumab  will be  administered using a n IV bag containin g 0.9% (w/v) saline or 5% (w/v) 
dextrose and delivered through an IV administration set with a 0.2 - or 0.22 -μm in -line filte r. The 
IV bag size should be chosen such that the final concentration of tremelimumab after dilution in 
the bag is between 0.10 mg/m L and 10 mg/mL. The appropriate IV bag size should be chosen for 
the respective dose. For the [ADDRESS_604114] manager or qualified personnel will be responsible for preparing the 
IV doses using the following steps:  
• Add the required  dose volume of tremelimumab  to the IV bag ; ensure the allowable 
concentration range stated above is maintained for the IV bag size .  
• Gently mix the solution in the bag by [CONTACT_118454]. Avoid shaking the IV bag to prevent foaming.  
Tremelimumab does not contain preservatives and any u nused portion must be discarded . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Administration of Tremelimumab for Intravenous Infusion  
Following preparation of the  dose , tremelimumab will be administered according to  the 
following guidelines:  
• Tremelimumab must be administered at room temperature (25°C) by [CONTACT_471382] a peripheral vein  or central line .  
• Prior to the start of the infusion, the  IV bag contents must be  at room temperature to 
avoid an infusion reaction due to the administration of the solution at low temperatures.  
• A physician must be present at the site or immediately available to respond to emergencies during all administrations of investigational product. Fully functional resuscitation facilities should be available.  
• Tremelimumab solution should not be infused wi th other solutions or medications.

Intratumoral injections as scheduled will be administered by a physician or nurse under 
physicia n supervision at a dose of 1 mg.  For particularly large lesions (>  [ADDRESS_604126] 
diameter), the polyICLC  dose can be divided and administered into more than [ADDRESS_604127] lesions, the needle can be moved within each quadrant of the 
lesion, or if the lesion is too large , separate injections will be given for a total dose of 1 mg  (to 
cover more of the lesion ). During injections , it is recommended that the investigator distribute 
the injectate throughout the lesion targeted.   If the lesion is too small to inject the complete 
volume of intratumoral study drug, the dose may be divided a mong a maximum of 3 lesions.  If 
the injected lesion regresses completely before all of the intratumoral  injections are 
administered, no further intratumoral injections will be given unless the lesion grows again 
during the intratumoral  injection period.  
One syringe  should be filled aseptically from 1  vial according to the directions above . 
Pain medication to be administered includes, if needed, acetaminophen , diphenhydramine , 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]. Other analgesics may be given at the discretion of the investigator.  
Some degree of inflammatory response in the injected lesion is expected as part of the therapy.  
Prior to each intratumoral injection, the maximal diameter of peritumoral inflammation will be 
recorded in millimeters and photographicall y, if appropriate in the judgment of the investigator, 
as a baseline for subsequent post -injection measurements.  
The subject s will be monitored before and for at least [ADDRESS_604128]  and i nvestigator preference and will be recorded in the

7.1 Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events  
7.1.1  General AE/SAE Definitions per ICH Guidelines  
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (inves tigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product . 
N.B.:  The definition above, provided for in the GCP -ICH Guideline E6, is being extended for the 
purpose of LICR studies to include any events, intercurrent diseases and accidents observed 
while the subject  is on study, i.e., during the actual treatment period, as well as during drug -
free, pre - and post -treatment periods .,  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
1. Results in death,  
2. Is life -threateningA, 
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
5. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or  
6. Is another medically important conditionB. 
A The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject  is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
B Medically important conditions that may not result in death, be immediately life -
threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_471353], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  or may require intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes l isted in the definition above. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
N.B.:  The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of an event (such as: 
mild, mod erate, or severe, e.g., pain). The event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on 
subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to 
subject ’s life or vital functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.

If a subject  becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study drugs  should be 
disconti nued immediately.   
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_218403] a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities or birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs  (see section 7.1.6) .  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  
The outcome of all pregn ancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented 
even if the subject  was discontinued from the study.   
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the stud y, the Investigator or other site personnel 
should inform the Sponsor  within 1 day, i .e., immediately, but no later than 24 hours  of when 
he or she becomes aware of it.   
The Sponsor will work with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided within 1 to 5  calendar days for SAEs and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.    
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_604135] dose of tremelimumab

congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_604136] drug 
dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented.

Therefore, the local study team should adopt the generic ICF template in line with local procedures and submit it to the relevant Ethics Committees (ECs)/Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs) prior to use .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overdose  
Any overdose (as defined in Section 6.6 ) of a study subject , with or without associated AEs/SAEs, 
is required to be reported within [ADDRESS_604138] be recorded and reported as an SAE according to Section 7.1.6. There is currently no specific treatment in the 
event of an overdose of the study drugs . The  Investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any 
overdose. See Section 6.6 for additional details.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatic Function Abnormality  
Hepatic function abnormality (as defined in Section 7.1.8)  in a study subject, with or without 
associated clinical manifestations, is required to be reported as “hepatic function abnormal” within 24 hours of knowledge of the event  to the Sponsor , unless a definitive underlying 
diagnosis for the abnormality (e.g., cholelithiasis or bile duct obstruction) that is unrelated to investigational product has been confirmed.  
• If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established and is 
unrelated to investigational product, the decision to continue dosing of the study 
subject will be based o n the clinical judgment of the I nvestigator.  
• If no definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality is established, dosing of the 
study subject must be interrupted immediately. Follow- up investigations and inquiries 
must be initiated by [CONTACT_38238] . 
Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be followed by [CONTACT_471389] M edImmune /[COMPANY_008].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  New Cancers  
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE. New primary cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the IP and have been identified after the subject’s inclusion in this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the study treatment period, or within the protocol -defined 
follow -up period (On Study Follow -up) after the administration of the last dose of study 
drug, must be reported as follows:  
• Death clearly resulting f rom disease progression should be reported to the Study 
Monitor/Physician at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the 
eCRF. It should be reported as an SAE  if it meets SAE reporting criteria per 
Section  7.1.6 . 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3 
LUD2014- 011 Protocol Amendment 6.0  (Final, 02-NOV -2021)  Page 54 of 102 • Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease under 
study, the AE causing the death must be reported to the Study Monitor/Physician as an SAE within 24 hours. It should also be documented in 
the eCRF.  
• The report should contain a comment regarding the co involvement of PD, if 
appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death.  
• Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. It should also be documented in the eCRF.  
• A post  mortem may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if 
performed, a copy of the post -mortem results should be forwarded to LICR 
within the usual timeframes.  
Deaths occurring after the protocol -defined safety follow- up period after the 
administration of the last dose of study drug should be documented only in the Post 
Study Follow -up eCRF form. If the death occurred as a result of an event that started 
after the defined safety follow -up period and the event is considered to be due to a late 
onset toxicity to study drug, then it should also be reported as an SAE.  
LICR and [COMPANY_008] retain the right to request additional information for any subject 
with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
7.1.3  Severity of an Adverse Event  
The severity of all serious and non -serious adverse events should be assessed according to the 
National Cancer Institute CTCAE Scale ( Version 4.03).  
7.1.4  Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The relation ship of all serious and non -serious adverse events to the investigational agent(s) will 
be determined by [CONTACT_218450], using one of the 
following terms (in accordance with NCI Guideline “Expedited Adverse Event R eporting 
Requirements for NCI Investigational Agents”, NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, January 
2001):  
Definitely related  (The AE is clearly related to the investigational agent)  
Probably related  (The AE is likely related  to the investigational agent ) 
Possibly related  (The AE may be related to the investigational agent)  
Unlikely related  (The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent)  
Unrelated  (The AE is clearly not related  to the investigational agent)  
N.B.:  When making the assessment on causality, it should be taken into consideration that 
immune -therapeutic agents have the potential to cause very late and/or permanent effects on 
the immune system, i.e., a causal relationship could exist despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a lack of apparent temporal 
relationship. Information provided in the IB and/or in Section  1 (Background) of this protocol 
may support these evaluations.

relationship.   The documentation includes: dates of onset and resolution, sev erity, seriousness, 
study drug intervention, treatment and outcome, as well as, the causal relationship between the 
event and the study drug in accordance with Section  7.1.4 .  This documentation is required for 
all AEs that occur:

b. until the off -study date or [ADDRESS_604140] administration of study drug, whichever 
is longer, or until a new treatment is initiated (see Section 3.1.10  for subjects who begin 
other anti -cance r treatment).  
Immune Related Adverse Events (irAEs) will be collected from the time of informed consent 
through [ADDRESS_604141] study treatment (regardless of initiation of 
another therapy) .

In addition to the General Reporting Requirements specified in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_604142] 
be reported by [CONTACT_67852]’s Drug Safety Contact (primarily) or, 
alternatively, to the Primary Sponsor Contact, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event  
(see contact [CONTACT_31307]) . SAEs should be reported via the Medidata RAVE data 
capture  system (which utilizes “Safety Gateway”) , using the respective Adverse Event and 
Safety Case Summary eCRFs.   This includes any deaths that occur after the off -study date, but 
within [ADDRESS_604143], the SAE should be reported using the “Initial Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form ,” provided by [CONTACT_1034] . 
Note: If an SAE cannot be reported via Medidata RAVE  or the “Initial Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form” within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, the Sponsor’s Drug Safety 
Contact (primarily) or, alternatively, the Primary Sponsor Contact, must be contact[CONTACT_299628] [ADDRESS_604144] or  an “Initial Serious

Serious adverse events must also be reported by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_218404] a serious adverse event t racking number by [CONTACT_429]. Institutional Review Boards may have specific rules on which Adverse Events need to 
be reported expeditiously, as well as,  the time frames for such reporting.  
SAE Reports will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1034]’s Med ical Monitor. Regulatory authorities and 
other investigators, as well as institutional and corporate partners, will be informed by [CONTACT_471391], laws and regulations in the countries where the 
investigational agent is being ad ministered. In particular, SAEs that are unexpected and for 
which a causal relationship with the study drug (s) cannot be ruled out, will be reported by [CONTACT_152245]  15 calendar days; if they are life -threatening or fatal, they will be reported within 
7 Calendar days.  
Serious adverse event reporting to [COMPANY_008]/Medimmune is described in  a separate 
agreement.  
7.1.7  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Follow -up Requirements  
Subjec ts experiencing SAEs should be followed closely until the condition resolves or stabilizes, 
and every effort should be made to  clarify the underlying cause. Follow -up information related 
to SAEs must be submitted to the Sponsor as soon as relevant data are available, using the “SAE 
Follow -up Report form”, provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
7.1.[ADDRESS_604148] (AESIs)  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI ) is an event of scientific and medical interest specific 
to understanding of the investigation al products and may require close monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to the S ponsor. An AESI may be serious or non -serious. The 
rapid re cording of all AEs including AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to 
characterize and understand them in association with the use of th e investigational products.   
AESIs for durvalumab and tremelimumab  include but are not limited to events with a potential 
inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent  
monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone

durvalumab monotherapy and combination therapy. An immune -related adverse event (irAE ) is 
defined as an adverse event that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune -mediated mechanism of action and where there is no clear alternate aetiology. 
Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, shou ld be used to support 
an irAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, 
metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the irAE.  
If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an AE being an irAE, the Investigat or should 
promptly contact [CONTACT_1689].  
If an AESI also meets SAE criteria, the event will be reported as an SAE per Section 7.1.6 . 
AESIs observed with durvalumab and tremelimumab and those considered AESIs for the 
purpose of this study are listed below.  Further information on these AESIs (e.g. presenting 
symptoms) can b e found in the current versions of the durvalumab (MEDI4736) and 
tremelimumab Investigator’s Brochures. Guidelines for the management of subjects experiencing toxicities for durvalumab and tremelimumab can be found in Section 8.3  and in the 
following Medimmune guideline: “Medimmune’s Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune - mediated, Infusion Related, and Non Immune -mediated 
Reactions (MEDI4736 (durvalumab) Monotherapy or Combination therapy with Tremelimumab or Tremelimumab monotherapy).
” 
• Diarrhea/ Colitis  and Intestinal Perforation 
Diarrhea and colitis are the most commonly observed treatment -emergent AEs 
following dosing with study medications.  In rare cases , colon perforation may occur 
that requires surgery (colectomy) or can lead to a fatal outcome, if not properly 
managed.  
• Pneumonitis /Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)  
Adverse events of pneumonitis have been observed with anti -PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 
antibodies  (see IB). Initial work -up should include high -resolution CT scan, ruling out 
infection, and pulse oximetry.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], p ulmonary consultation is required.  
• Hepatic Function Abnormality (Hepatitis / transaminase increases ) 
Increased transaminases have been reported during treatment with anti- PD-L1/anti -PD-
1 antibodies (see IB).  Inflammatory hepatitis has been reported in 3% to 9% of subjects treated with anti -CTLA -4 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).  The clinical 
manifestations of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -treated subjects included general weakness, fatigue, 
nausea and/or mild fever and increased liver function tests such as AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and/or total bilirubin. Hepatic function abnormality is defined as any incre ase in ALT or AST to greater than 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in total bilirubin 
to be greater than 2 × ULN.  Concurrent findings are those that derive from a single blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of each other.  Follow -up 
investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by [CONTACT_471392]/or whether there is objective 
evidence that clearly supports causation by a concurrent or pre -existing disease (e.g.,

than the investigational product. Cases where a subject shows an AST or ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_604150] or total bilirubin ≥  [ADDRESS_604151] may need to be reported as SAEs. These cases should b e 
reported as SAEs if, after evaluation they meet the criteria for a Hy’s Law case or if any 
of the individual liver test parameters fulfill any of the SAE criteria.    
• Neurotoxicity ( Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity ) 
Immune -mediated nervous system even ts include  encephalitis, peripheral motor and 
sensory neuropathies, Guillain -Barré, and myasthenia gravis . 
• Endocrine Disorders  
Immune -mediated endocrinopathies include hypo - and hyper -thyroidism, adrenal 
insufficiency, hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297] , and Typ e 1 diabetes mellitus.  
Type 1 diabetes mellitus: For subjects with suspected diabetes mellitus, Investigators 
should obtain an endocrinology consult and institute appropriate management which 
may include the administration of insulin.  
• Dermatitis /Rash  
Prompt treatment with steroids (topi[INVESTIGATOR_299587]) is important as per current established toxicity management guidelines.  
• Nephritis  and increases in Serum Creatinine  
A consult with a Nephrologist should be done as well as monitoring fo r signs and 
symptoms that may be related to changes in renal function (e.g., routine urinalysis, elevated serum BUN and creatinine, decreased creatinine clearance, electrolyte 
imbalance, decrease in urine output, proteinuria, etc.). Subjects should be thor oughly 
evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, infections, etc.). 
Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear alternative etiology even for low grade events (Grade 2), in order to prevent potential progression t o higher grade event . 
• Pancreati c Disorders  
Immune -mediated pancreatitis includes autoimmune p ancreatitis or labs suggestive of 
pancreatitis  (increased serum lipase, increased serum amylase) . 
• Myocarditis  
Myocarditis, a rare, but severe immune -mediated adver se event, presents with 
signs/symptoms such as decreased ejection fraction, arrhythmias, in particular 
occurrences of atrioventricular block. For patients with suspected myocarditis, 
investigators should obtain a cardiology consult and institute full diagn ostic work -up 
(that includes exclusion of other alternate causes such as infection) . 
• Myositis /Polymyositis  
Myositis or polymyositis should be suspected in patients who present with proximal 
muscle weakness and the evaluation should include an examination of the skin, muscle enzyme measurement, antibody testing, any systemic disease manifestations and exclusion of other diseases including drug- induced myopathy. Cases of myositis have 
been reported with myocarditis in which immune infiltration has been described in skeletal and cardiac muscle (see IB).

4. Section 3.1.3: “will be” was change d to “is.”  
5. Section 3.1.6: Phase 2 sample size language was clarified by [CONTACT_471395]:  
“The expansion phase sample size of 66 subjects is deemed to be sufficient for the assessment of 
safety and tolerability as it provides sufficient precision for estimation of adverse events.   The 
confidence intervals (CI) for estimating the incidence of AEs ranging from 10% to 90% (in 
increments of 10%) are listed b elow.   The margins of error (half width of the CI) are deemed 
acceptable for the estimation of AE incidences in this early phase trial.”  The following table was inserted:

will be enrolled into the P hase 2 cohort at  the RCD according to Cohort 1C. If Cohort 1C 
is not cleared, the RCD of the previo usly cleared cohort will be used for Phase 2. For the  
Cohort 1A  doublet, if dose Level -1 is too toxic, the RCD cannot be determined and the 
study will stop.  Otherwise, Cohorts 1B and 1C  triplets  will open in parallel at the 
doublet RCD of Cohort 1A, and the triplet RCD will be  determined in both Cohorts 1B 
and 1C.  If no triplet RCD can be determined, Phase 2 of the study will be done at  the 
Cohort 1A doublet RCD. If triplet RCDs are determined for both Cohorts 1B and 1C, the 
triplet RCD of Cohort 1C will be used in Phase 2 . If a triplet RCD can only be determined

• The durvalumab dosing requirements were added for subjects whose body weight drops 
to ≤ 30 kg while on the study . 
4. Section 3.1.8 (Dosing Adjustments, Delays and Discontinuations). The following paragraph was adde d: “If a toxicity occurs that requires toxicity management in accordance with 
Sections  8.3 or 8.4, and the toxicity causing drug can be clearly identified, then the respective 
guideline should be followed. If the toxicity causing drug cannot be identified, then the more conservative guideline (i.e., the guideline that provides for the greatest dose reduction, dose delays or holds)  should be followed . “

Appropriate summaries of AEs,  SAEs, DLTs,  laboratory data, and vital sign data will be 
presented. AEs will be listed individually per subject according to the NCI CTCAE , Version 
4.03,  and the number of subjects experiencing each AE will be summa rized using descriptive 
statistics. ” 
11. Section 4.3 (Tremelimumab PK) was deleted. Rationale: Systemic levels of tremelimumab 
after low intratumoral doses are  not of interest. Other sections were re- numbered 
accordingly.  
12. Section 5.1  (Inclusion Criteria)  #1 wa s modified based on PI [INVESTIGATOR_471357] (changes 
in bold):  “Subject s must have histologic confirmation of advanced  unresectable disease, have 
failed at least one standard of care therapy, and do not have curative options. Tumors should 
be biopsy -accessible  (see NOTE 1), measurable cancers of the following histologies:

HNSCC after failure of prior therapy  
- Locally recurrent or metastatic  breast cancer  
- Sarcoma  
- Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC)

scan (e.g., cutaneous lesions, inguinal nodes, supraclavicular or cervical nodes, superficial 
abdominal lesions, and lesions that are accessible by [CONTACT_471398]/structures).  NOTE 2: CTCL may respond very differ ently than solid tumors; 
therefore, the study will primarily focus on solid tumors, but a “signal- seeking” approach to 
including some subjects with CTCL will be supported.  There will be a limit of < 10 -20% CTCL 
for total enrollment.”  
13. Section 5.1 (Inclusio n Criteria) #2 was changed FROM:  
“Subject s with measurable disease as defined by  [CONTACT_299602] 1.1: at  least [ADDRESS_604195] 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) ,

TO: “Subjects need to have at least 2 lesions, as follows:  
(1) [ADDRESS_604199] 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded), 
where each lesion must be ≥ 10 mm when measured by [CONTACT_20420] (CT), 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or caliper measurement by [CONTACT_471401], or ≥ 
[ADDRESS_604200] 
be ≥ [ADDRESS_604201] or MRI. These lesions should not be 
injected with study drug or biopsied.  
(2) 1 larger lesion (approximately 2 cm or more) amenable to repeated multiple core 
biopsies  or at least [ADDRESS_604202] also be 
suitable for repeated injections of study drug, either as single injection in larger lesions 
(preferred) or multiple injections in up to [ADDRESS_604203] 1  additional lesion amenable to biopsy. Th is/th ese 
lesion (s) should not be injected with study drug. ” 
Rationale: The criterion was reworded to provide clarification for the lesions that are 
needed for the study.  
14. Section 5.2  (Exclusion Criteria):  
• #[ADDRESS_604204] (changes in bold): “Prior treatment with combination 
CTLA -4 and PD -1/PD -L1 blockade, with the exception of subjects with melanoma.”  
• #7 was updated as follows (changes in bold):  
“Active, suspected or prior documented autoimmune disease (including but not 
restricted to inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease,  irritable bowel syndrome , 
Wegner’s granulomatosis  and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis,  etc.). Participants with vitiligo, 
alopecia , type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism  (e.g., following Hashimoto 
syndrome ) due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis 
or any chronic skin condition  not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not 
expected to  recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.  Subjects 
without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only after consultation 
with the study physician. Subjects with celiac disease controlled by [CONTACT_471402].”  
Rationale: irritable bowel syndrome was deleted from the list of examples for 
autoimmune diseases, as it should not have been included in this category.  The 
remaining changes were clarifications and updates per standard language in current protocols.  
• #17 - contraception language was updated according to current recommendations from 
MedImmune.  
• #18 was updated for clarification (changes in bold): “ Any condition that, in the clinical 
judgment of the treating physician, is likely to interfere with the interpretability of the data or  to prevent the subject  from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that 
may put the subject  at unacceptable risk. ”

If a toxicity occurs that requires toxicity management in accordance with Sections  8.3 or 8.4, and 
the toxicity causing drug can be clearly identified, then the respective guideline should be 
followed. If the toxicity causing drug cannot be identified, then the more conservative guideline (i.e., the guideline that provides for the greatest dose reduction, dose delays or holds)  should be 
followed . 
8.3.1  Durvalumab  and Tremelimumab Dose Modifications due to Toxicity  
Durvalumab  (MEDI4736)  and tremelimumab administration  may  be modified or discontinued as 
a result of toxicities  as described in  the table below.   
Additional information and guidance  regarding dose modification due to toxicity are provided 
from Medimmune in the following guideline:

mediated, Infusion Related, and Non Immune -mediated Reactions (MEDI4736 Monotherapy 
or Combination therapy with Tremelimumab or Tremelimumab monotherapy) . 
Dose modifications will not be required for AEs that are clearly not attributed to durvalumab  or 
tremelimumab (such as an accident)  or for laboratory abnormalities that are not deemed to be 
clinically significant . 
MEDI4736 (M) and Tremelimumab (T) Dose Modification Due to Toxicity  
Note:  If M and T dosing is held temporarily until resolution of the event as per instructions 
below, treatment should resume at the next scheduled treatment date.  
Immune -related Adverse Events (irAEs)  
Immune -related adverse events are defined as AEs of immune nature (i.e., inflammatory) in 
the absence of a clear alternative etiology.  Maximum supportive care, including 
immunosuppressive medications, such as high dose steroids, is allowed to induce resol ution 
of the event.  However, infliximab should not be used for management of immune -related 
hepatitis.  
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of M and T depi[INVESTIGATOR_48393],  
permanently discontinue M  and T also for:  
• Any Grade rash with bullous skin formations.  
• Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10 mg of prednisone per day (or equivalent) within [ADDRESS_604218] dose of study drug/regimen.  
• Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -related AE following

LUD2014- 011 Protocol Amendment 6.0  (Final, 02-NOV -2021)  Page [ADDRESS_604222] Guidelines  
The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines were  revised in [ADDRESS_604223] 1.1. (55) These guidelines have been the widely accepted criteria to assess response and 
progression in solid tumors ; however, limitations have been noted in the use of RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_604224] shown that complete 
response, partial response, or stable disease status can still be achieved after an initial increase 
in overall tumor burden, and regression of initial lesions may occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_471360].  The Immune -related Response Criteria (irRC) were developed to address the need for 
response criteria in an immunotherapy setting. (56)  The main difference with irRC was that it 
considered the subject's total tumor burden  at each subsequent assessment and required 
confirmation of suspected disease progression with subsequent imaging, approximately four weeks later.  In addition, a greater number of lesions (10 vs.  5) were measured in a 
bidimensional manner instead of unidimensionally  as in RECIST 1.1 .  In 2013, Nishino et al. 
demonstrated that immune -related response criteria using unidimensional measurements were 
highly concordant with the bidimensional results of  irRC, but with less measurement 
variability. (57)  Based on these findings and in order to utilize both the  established criteria of 
irRC and RECIST 1.1, the two systems have been adapted, modified, and combined into the Immune -related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) .(58)  The adapted 
irRECIST criteria are modifications to the irRC, incorporating the findings of Nishino et al. and the advantages of RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_604225] 1.1 guidelines as published ( 55) and as summarized by 
[CONTACT_299649] -involved clinical trials .   
I. Disease Parameters for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_604226] diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_604227] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > [ADDRESS_604228] x -ray, as >[ADDRESS_604229] scan, or >[ADDRESS_604230] be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).   Note:  Tumor lesions tha t are 
situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol . 
NOTE for irRECIST: During target lesion selection the radiologist will consider information on the 
anatomical sites of previous intervention (e.g. previous irradiation, RF -ablation, TACE, surgery, etc.). 
Lesions undergoing prior intervention will not be selected as target lesions unless there has been a 
demonstration of progress in the lesion.

will be measured and followed.  
Non -measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease ), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmon itis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.   ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection 
as target lesions.  
NOTE for irRECIST: Lesions that are partially cystic or necrotic can be selected as target lesions. The 
longest diameter of such a lesion will be added to  the Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB) of all 
target lesions at baseline. If other lesions with a non -liquid/non -necrotic component are present, those 
should be preferred.  
Brain lesions detected on brain scans can be considered as both target or non -target lesions depending 
on the protocol definition.  
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded 
and m easured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  I t may be the case that, 
on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal les ions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be use d as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non -target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any non -measureable as well 
as measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified a s non -target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not 
required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follo w-up.  
II. Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never mor e than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.

SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3 
LUD2014- 011 Protocol Amendment 6.0  (Final, 02-NOV -2021)  Page 88 of 102 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluat ion by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions:   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph no des) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x- ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acce ptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness  is [ADDRESS_604232] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly 
impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of 
MRI is variable g lobally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  
Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as  was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the sam e type of scanner should be used , and 
the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuati on correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic C T (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT intro duces 
additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_251634], confirmation by 
[CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological

following c omplete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinic al response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian 
cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published .(59-61)  In 
additi on, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_604233] -line trials in ovarian 
cancer .(62)  
Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete res ponses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect 
of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
FDG -PET:   While FDG- PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG- PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified accord ing to the following algorithm:  
a) Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG- PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.  
b) No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a ne w site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the 
positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional 
follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at 
that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG- PET scan).  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
c) FDG -PET may be used to up grade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG- PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in 
the protocol and support ed by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion mean s one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than 
twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.

LUD2014- 011 Protocol Amendment 6.0  (Final, 02-NOV -2021)  Page 90 of 102 Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.    
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive  Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum mu st also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study  
B. Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non -CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor  
marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.   
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_471361], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
C. Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start o f the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement  and confirmation criteria.

below.  
I. Baseline Assessments in irRECIST  
In irRECIST , baseline assessment and measurement of measurable/non -measurable and 
target/non -target lesions and lymph nodes are in line with RECIST 1.1.  One new definition is 
added: If a subject has no measurable and no non -measurable disease at baseline the radiolo gist 
will assign ‘No Disease’ (irND) as the overall tumor assessment for any available follow -up time 
points unless new measurable lesions are identified and contribute to the total measured tumor 
burden ( TMTB ).  irND is a valid assessment in studies with adjuvant setting where the protocol 
and study design allow the inclusion of subjects with no visible disease  
II Follow -up Assessments  in irRECIST 
A. Follow -up recording of target and new measurable lesions  
A key difference in irRECIST is that the appearance n ew lesions do es not automatically 
indicate progression .  Instead, all measured lesions (baseline -selected target lesions and new 
measurable lesions) are combined into the total measured tumor burden (TMTB)  at follow up.   
Baseline -selected target lesions and new measurable lesions are  NOT assessed separately. 
Measurements of those lesions ar e combined into the TMTB, and one combined assessment 
provided.  
In order to be selected as new measurable lesions  (≤ 2 lesions per organ, ≤ 5 lesions total, per 
time point ), new lesions must meet criteria as defined for baseline target lesion selection and 
meet the same minimum size requirements of [ADDRESS_604235] 1.1 definitions for assessment of non -target lesions apply.  The response of non -target 
lesions primarily contributes to the overall response assessments of irCR and irNon -CR/Non -PD 
(irNN). Non -target lesions do not affect irPR and irSD assessments. Only a massive and 
unequivocal worsening of non -target lesions alone, even without progress in the TMTB is 
indicative of irPD .  In align ment with RECIST 1.1, baseline selected non -target lesions can never 
convert to measurable lesions, not even if they increase in size at subsequent time points and 
become measurable. Only true new lesions can be measured and contribute to the TMTB . 
C. Follow -up for New Non -Measurable Lesions  
All new lesions not selected as new measurable lesions are considered new non -measurable 
lesions and are followed qualitatively. Only a massive and unequivocal progression of new non -
measurable lesions leads to an overall assessment of irPD for the time  point. Persisting new 
non-measurable lesions prevent irCR.

organ, up to total 5  lesions) is  measured.   At each  subsequent tumor assessment, the SumD of  
the target lesions and of new, measurable lesions  (up to 2 new lesions per organ, total 5 new 
lesions) are added  together to provide the total measurable tumor burden (TMTB) . 
Overall Assessments by [CONTACT_299650] 
(irCR)  Complete disappearance of all measurable and non -measurable lesions. Lymph 
nodes must decrease to < 10 mm in short axis.  
Partial Response (irPR)  Decrease of ≥ 30% in TMTB relative to baseline, non -target lesions are irNN, 
and no unequivocal progression of new non- measurable lesions  
• If new measurable lesions appear in subjects with no target lesions at 
baseline , irPD will be assessed. That irPD time  point will be considered a 
new baseline, and all subsequent time points will be compared to it for 
response assessment. irPR is possible if the TMTB of new measurable 
lesions decreases by ≥ 30% compared to the first irPD documentation  
• irRECIST can be used  in the adjuvant setting , in subjects with no visible 
disease on CT/MRI scans. The appearance of new measurable lesion(s) 
automatically leads to an increase in TMTB by 100% and leads to irPD. 
These subjects can achieve a response if the TMTB decreases at follow -up, 
as a sign of delayed response.  
• Based on the above, sponsors may consider enrolling subjects with no 
measurable disease and/or no visible disease in studies with response 
related endpoints . 
Stable Disease (irSD)  Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPD 
Progressive Disease 
(irPD)  Minimum 20% increase and minimum [ADDRESS_604237] 
irPD assessment. An irPD confirmation scan may be recommended for subjects with a minimal TMTB % -increase over 20% and especially during the flare time -
window of the first 12 weeks of treatment, depending on the compound 
efficacy expectation s, to account for expected delayed response.  
• In irRECIST a substantial and unequivocal increase of non- target lesions  is 
indicative of progression.  
• IrPD may be assigned for a subject with multiple new non -measurable 
lesions  if they are considered to be a s ign of unequivocal massive 
worsening  
Other  irNE:  used in exceptional cases where insufficient data exist.  
irND:  in adjuvant setting when no disease is detected  
irNN: , no target disease was identified at baseline, and at follow- up the subject 
fails to meet criteria for irCR or irPD

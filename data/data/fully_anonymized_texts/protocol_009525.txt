The mean and standard deviation for each group will be used to apply a standard t-test to assess for statistical significance between the two groups. Rationale for Number of Subjects Sample size was guided by [CONTACT_894368]. Experiments focusing on post operative pain in breast surgery using regional nerve blocks showed statistical significance with sample sizes ranging from [ADDRESS_1252915] operative narcotic consumption.  1.1 Overview of Non-Clinical Studies N/A 1.[ADDRESS_1252916] reduction operations.  Understanding the efficacy of this intervention will help guide management for this population. 2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment Nerve blocks are performed under sterile conditions with topi[INVESTIGATOR_894361]. Ultrasound guidance is used to help avoid needle-to-nerve contact [CONTACT_894369]. Intravascular injection can also be avoided by [CONTACT_75461][INVESTIGATOR_894362]. Visualization of local anesthetic spread around the desired nerve is highly predictive of a successful block.  In this study, the nerve blocks are performed in the operating room. In the operating room, the blocks are performed while vital signs are continuously monitored using non-invasive blood pressure monitoring and pulse oximetry. Emergency medications and equipment is readily available.   [ADDRESS_1252917] reduction/simple mastectomy.  The patients will be assessed intra and post operatively. Our primary outcome will be the post operative pain scores using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Secondary outcomes that will also be investigated include: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_894363], length of stay and time to discharge from recovery room.  Total duration of subject participation will be one week.  Total duration of the study is expected to be 1 year 5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION 5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint      Reduction in NRS pain score by 2 points 5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints • Opi[INVESTIGATOR_17010]: Reduction in postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_105855] 20% • Length of stay: Reduction in length of stay by 60 minutes 5.3 Safety Evaluations • Incidence of adverse events [ADDRESS_1252918] therapy is allowed except for treatments noted in the exclusion criteria described above and as noted in the prohibited medications section below.

An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product.  An 
unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity or frequency than expected based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure. The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause. AE Severity The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the guidelines shown in Table 1 below should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious. Table 1.  AE Severity Grading Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well. Moderate (2) Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required. Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125]. Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  AE Relationship to Study Drug The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the guidelines in Table 2. Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug Relationship to Drug Comment Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846]. 
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_82978]. Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. Unrelated An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study drug. 11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE) An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: • death • a life-threatening adverse experience • inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] • a persistent or significant disability/incapacity • a congenital anomaly/birth defect  Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.   11.2.1 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per UCSF CHR Guidelines.  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed. In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site investigator will report SAEs to the IRB/IEC.   11.3 Medical Monitoring Esther Kim should be contact[CONTACT_560728].

Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following: • Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria • Use of a prohibited concomitant medication Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a protocol violation.  When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by a Sponsor representative and the Investigator. A copy of the form will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder and in the Sponsor’s files. 14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifications to the analysis plan described below.   14.1 Data Sets Analyzed All eligible patients who are randomized into the study and receive either the study drug or placebo will be included in the safety analysis. 14.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics The following demographic variables at screening will be summarized:  age, height and weight.   14.[ADDRESS_1252931]’s visit into the protocol-specific electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) OR paper CRF when the information corresponding to that visit is available.  Subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_92293] (or designee), but will be identified by a subject number and initials. For eCRFs: If a correction is required for an eCRF, the time and date stamps track the person entering or updating eCRF data and creates an electronic audit trail.  For paper CRFs:  If a correction is made on a CRF, the study staff member will line through the incorrect data, write in the correct data and initial and date the change. The Investigator is responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled in this study.  All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and verified for completeness and accuracy by [CONTACT_737].  A copy of the CRF will remain at the Investigator’s site at the completion of the study. 15.[ADDRESS_1252932] been entered into the study database, a system of computerized data validation checks will be implemented and applied to the database on a regular basis. Query reports (Data Clarification Requests) pertaining to data omissions and discrepancies will be forwarded to the Investigators and study monitors for resolution.  The study database will be updated in accordance with the resolved queries.  All changes to the study database will be documented. 15.[ADDRESS_1252933] unauthorized access by [CONTACT_1627]; appropriate backup copi[INVESTIGATOR_1493].

At critical junctures of the protocol (e.g., production of interim reports and final reports), data for analysis is locked and cleaned per established procedures. 
15.[ADDRESS_1252934] make study data accessible to the monitor, other authorized representatives of the Sponsor (or designee), IRB/IEC, and Regulatory Agency (e.g., FDA) inspectors upon request.  A file for each subject must be maintained that includes the signed Informed Consent, HIPAA Authorization and Assent Form and copi[INVESTIGATOR_29131].  The Investigator must ensure the reliability and availability of source documents from which the information on the CRF was derived. All study documents (patient files, signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_3110], Study File Notebook, etc.) must be kept secured for a period of two years following marketing of the investigational product or for two years after centers have been notified that the IND has been discontinued.  There may be other circumstances for which the Sponsor is required to maintain study records and, therefore, the Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_123819]. 15.6 Monitoring Monitoring visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_223698] U.S. CFR Title 21 Parts 50, 56, and 312 and ICH Guidelines for GCP (E6).    By [CONTACT_12570], the Investigator grants permission to the Sponsor (or designee), and appropriate regulatory authorities to conduct on-site monitoring and/or auditing of all appropriate study documentation. 15.[ADDRESS_1252935] confidentiality issues (if applicable) are covered in the Clinical Study Agreement. 16 ADMINISTRATIVE, ETHICAL, REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of Human Volunteers (21 CFR 50), Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 312). To maintain confidentiality, all laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports and other records will be identified by a coded number and initials only.  All study records will be kept in a locked file cabinet and code sheets linking a patient’s name [CONTACT_1639] a patient identification number will be stored separately in another locked file cabinet.  Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1622].  The Investigator must also comply with all applicable privacy regulations (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC). 16.1 Protocol Amendments Any amendment to the protocol will be written by [CONTACT_473].  Protocol amendments cannot be implemented without prior written IRB/IEC approval except as necessary to eliminate immediate safety hazards to patients.  A protocol amendment intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be implemented immediately, provided the IRBs are notified within five working days. 
16.2 Institutional Review Boards and Independent Ethics Committees The protocol and consent form will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC of each participating center prior to study initiation.  Serious adverse experiences regardless of causality will be reported to the IRB/IEC in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC, and the Investigator will keep the IRB/IEC informed as to the progress of the study.  The Investigator will obtain assurance of IRB/IEC compliance with regulations. Any documents that the IRB/IEC may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, protocol amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning patient recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) will be submitted to the IRB/IEC.  The IRB/IECs written unconditional approval of the study protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator before the study is initiated.  The IRB/IECs unconditional approval statement will be transmitted by [CONTACT_894370].  This approval must refer to the study by [CONTACT_82989]. Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may not be initiated without prior written IRB/IEC approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Such modifications will be submitted to the IRB/IEC and written verification that the modification was submitted and subsequently approved should be obtained.   The IRB/IEC must be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for review; serious and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the study in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB; new information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients of the conduct of the study; an annual update and/or request for re-approval; and when the study has been completed. 16.3 Informed Consent Form  Informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, US Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, if applicable), and local regulations. The Investigator will prepare the informed consent form, assent and HIPAA authorization and provide the documents to the Sponsor or designee for approval prior to submission to the IRB/IEC.  The consent form generated by [CONTACT_183113]/IEC.  The written consent document will embody the elements of informed consent as described in the International Conference on Harmonisation and will also comply with local regulations. The Investigator will send an IRB/IEC-approved copy of the Informed Consent Form to the Sponsor (or designee) for the study file. A properly executed, written, informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to entering the subject into the trial.  Information should be given in both oral and written form and subjects (or their legal representatives) must be given ample opportunity to inquire about details of the study.  If appropriate and required by [CONTACT_1036]/IEC, assent from the subject will also be obtained.  If a subject is unable to sign the informed consent form (ICF) and the HIPAA authorization, a legal representative may sign for the subject.   A copy of the signed consent form 
(and assent) will be given to the subject or legal representative of the subject and the original will be maintained with the subject’s records. 16.[ADDRESS_1252936] of 1996.  16.5 Investigator Responsibilities By [CONTACT_29184], the Investigator agrees to: 1.

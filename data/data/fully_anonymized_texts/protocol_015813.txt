only). 
The safety outcome measures to be assessed are:  
• Reported a dverse events (AEs) including treatment- emergent 
(TEAE)  monitored from time of consent through the end of 
study ; 
• Changes in clinical labs including c omplete blood count (CBC), 
chemistry, and urinalysis between Baseline and Day 85,  
• Subject’s r eports of burning/stinging obtained during visits on 
Day 1, Day 15, Day 29, Day 57, and Day 85.  
Pregnancy  testing will be conducted for women of child- bearing 
potential (WOCBP) at the Screening Visit, the Baseline Visit (if > 7 
days from Screening Visit) and at the  Day 29, Day 57 and Day 85 
Visits.  
Total Sample Size:  Approximately 200  subjects randomized 1:1 (100 subjects to 
BTX  1204 4% and 100 subjects to Vehicle)  will be enrolled.    
Methods:  Subjects will begin screening to determine eligibility to participate in 
the study.  Informed consent/as sent, medical history/review of systems, 
demographics, height and weight will be obtained.  Urine pregnancy 
testing (UPT) will be conducted for WOCBP  and a urine drug screen 
(UDS) will occur . Measurement of the total body surface area (BSA) 
of AD involveme nt and IGA will be assessed at Screening .  At selected 
photography sites , a target lesion will be identified .  
Within 28 days after the Screening Visit, Baseline assessments for 
safety (CBC, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be obtained on Day  1.  If 
the subject is eligible to participate, Screening and Baseline may occur 
at the same visit. If the Screening Visit and Baseline Visit are not 
concurrent, IGA, UPT, UDS, and BSA of AD, will be repeated at the 
  Page 10 
Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version 1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  Baseline Visit. Review of eligibility crite ria will be repeated.  Signs of 
AD and the EASI score s will be obtained. Subjects will be asked to rate 
their pr uritus using the itch numeric rating score (I -NRS) which is an 
average level of itch over the past 24 hours on a sc ale of 0 (no itch) to 
10 (worst imaginable  itch).  At selected sites, p hotographs and Signs of 
AD scoring  of the target lesion will be obtained.  Subjects will be 
randomized 1:1 using an Interactive Web- based Response System 
(IWRS) to receive active BTX 120 4 4% or Vehicle.  Subjects will 
receive their first dose of study drug applied by [CONTACT_684916] 15 minutes after the initial 
application .  Subjects  will be given 4 weeks  of study drug and instructed 
in the proper applicat ion for twice daily (BID) applications to cover 
their AD lesions , except on the scalp and groin.   
Subjects will be provided with a diary to record their daily pruritus 
score using the worst itch numeric rating score (WI -NRS) .  Subjects 
will record the WI -NRS  over the past [ADDRESS_928170] application 
techniques.  Another four weeks of study drug will be dispensed along 
with a new diary.       
  Page 11 
Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version 1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  The final study drug application will be applied in  the evening prior to 
the Day 85 Visit.   
Subjects  will return to the clinic for their final visit on Day 85 for safety 
assessments; blood samples for CBC  and chemistry, and urine sample s 
for urinalysis.   A UPT will be conducted for WOCBP.  Subjects will be 
queried for adverse events and changes in concomitant medications 
since their previous visit.  Returned study drug will be weighed and 
diaries will be reviewed for compliance.  The site will obtain IGA , BSA 
of AD, Signs of AD  score, and EASI Score. Subjects will be asked to 
rate their pruritus using the I -NRS.  At selected sites, the target lesion 
will be photographed and scored with the Signs of AD  score.   
If a subject discontinues from the study early, all Day [ADDRESS_928171] will be discharged 
from the study.  
  Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless 
otherwise stated.  
Analysis Sets : 
This study will be evaluated using 3 analysis sets: intent- to-treat (ITT), 
per protocol (PP), and safety.  Efficacy conclusions will be drawn from 
the ITT analysis set.  The ITT analysis set will consist of all randomized 
subjects with at least one post -baseline efficacy assessment and will be 
based on randomized study group, regardless of study drug received.  
The PP analysis set will be used to support the efficacy findings in the 
ITT analyses and will include subjects with no major protocol 
deviations.  Safety conclusions will be drawn from the safety analysis 
set.  The safety analysis set will include all subjects that received at 
least one application of study drug and had at least one post -baseline 
safety assessment with treatment based on study drug r eceived 
regardless of randomization group.   
Demographics will be summariz ed using the safety analysis set by 
[CONTACT_347704], gender, race, ethnicity , height , weight , and BMI .  The 
primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on the ITT population.  For 
conti nuous variables, the mean, standard deviation (SD), median , and 
range will be presented along with the 95% confidence interval  (CI).   
  Page 12 
Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version 1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  Categorical variables will be summari zed by [CONTACT_684734] 
95% CI.  
Handling of Missing Data:  
The primary meth od of handling missing efficacy data in the ITT 
analysis set will be based on LOCF .  Other imputation methods (e.g., 
mixed model for repeated measurement [MMRM]) may be used as a 
sensitivity analysis.  
All s afety analyses will be  conducted using  the safety  analysis set. No 
imputation s will be made for missing safety data.  
Efficacy Analyses:  
The efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT (primary) and 
PP (supportive) analysis sets. The efficacy variables include the IGA, 
BSA of AD, Signs of AD  score, and EASI s core collected at Screening  
and/or Baseline and all subsequent study visits. The primary efficacy 
endpoint for the study is  the proportion of subjects with IGA success 
defined as an IGA score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) with at least a 
2-grade improvement from Baseline at Day 85.  The IGA will be 
dichotomized into “success” and “failure” at study Day 15, Day 29, Day 
57, and Day 85.   
This Phase 2 a study is designed to identify the response to BTX 1204 
relative to vehicle. Statistical tests applied to the outcomes will be 
exploratory.  No adjustments for Type  1 error will occur.  
Success on IGA defined as a score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) and 
at least a 2 -grade improvement from Baseline at Day 15, Day 29, Day 
57, and Day  85 will be anal yzed using logistic regression, adjusting for 
Baseline IGA.   
The change from Baseline in BSA of AD at Day 15, Day 29, Day 57 
and Day 85 will be analyzed used ANCOVA with Baseline BSA of AD 
and treatment as covariates.   
Summary statistics will be pre sented for the change from B aseline in 
each of the  Signs of AD (erythema, exudation, excoriation, 
induration/papulation, and lichenification) at each timepoint (Day 15 , 
Day 29, Day 57 and Day 85).  A total score will be calculated based on 
the sum of each of t he Signs of AD (0, 1, 2, or 3; max score of 15) and 
the chang e from Baseline will be summariz ed for each timepoint.  The 
change from B aseline in Signs of AD at Day 15, Day 29, Day 57, and 
  Page 13 
Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version 1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  Day 85 will be analyzed using  ANCOVA with Baseline Signs of AD 
score and treatment as covariates.   
Summary statistics will be prepared for the change from Baseline in the 
EASI Score  and I -NRS at each timepoint (Day 15, Day 29, Day 57 and 
Day 85). Summary statistics will also be prepared for the change from 
Baseline in the  Signs of AD  score for the target lesion (selected sites)  
at each timepoint (Day 15 , Day 29, Day 57 and Day 85 ).  
Summaries of the pruritus scores reported by [CONTACT_684917].  
Safety Analyses :  
All subjects  who receive at least one confirmed dose of study drug and 
have at least one post -Baseline assessment will be included in the safety 
analyses. Safety analyses will include summaries of AEs, TEAEs, 
serious AEs (SAEs), and changes in laboratory assessments.  AEs, 
TEAEs and SAEs will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary and 
summarize d by [CONTACT_1570], the number of subjects  reporting 
events, system organ class, preferred term, severity, relat ionship to 
study drug, and seriousness. A  list of  subjects  who prematurely 
discontinue from the study due to an AE  and the reason for 
discontinuation will be provided. 
The number and percentage of subject s reporting each medication will 
be summariz ed.  Med ications taken by [CONTACT_684918].  
Changes in laboratory parameters from Baseline to Day [ADDRESS_928172]  will be listed.  
Sample Size:  
The sample size for this study is b ased on clinical considerations only. 
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 with 100 subjects in each treatment 
group for a total 200 subjects. This is considered adequate to evaluate 
the safety and tolerability and preliminary information on efficacy of

Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version 1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
1.1. Background Information  
Botanix Pharmaceuticals ' BTX 1204 contains the  active pharmaceutical ingredient , cannabidiol  
(CBD; 2-[(1R,6R) -6-isopropenyl -3-methylcyclohex- 2-en-1-yl]-5-pentylbenzene -1,3-diol).  CBD  is 
a member of a broader family of compounds known as cannabinoids, a class of c ompounds 
originally derived from the cannabis sativa plant. [Olah 2014] CBD is chemical ly synthesized  
under  Good Manufacture Practices ( GMP ) for use in this study.  
Interest in CBD -based therapeutics has increased significantly in recent years, as published  data 
has highlighted the potential efficacy and safety benefits of this compound. [Volkow 2015] CBD  
is not psychoactive and clinical trials have demonstrated  that CBD  may successfully treat epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], 
arthritis, pain , and even Fragile X Syndrome. [Fernande z-Ruiz 2012]  There are now more than 
[ADDRESS_928178] , or pending recruitment around 
the world that are studying CBD  in a range of diseases.  [ClinicalTrials.gov Aug 2018]  
Botanix Pharmaceuticals i s developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a number of topi[INVESTIGATOR_684898] -inflammatory effects of CBD that have reported in the 
literature.  Initial clinical development of  these topi[INVESTIGATOR_684899] 
a single dose or as multiple doses.  Subsequent clinical studies have again focused on establishing 
safety and local cutaneous tolerability in the disease state u nder investigation.  To date, Botanix 
Pharmaceuticals has completed 3 Phase 1 clinical studies with formulations containing 
concentrations of CBD up to 5% (w/w) with once  (QD) or twice daily ( BID) dosage  regimens for 
up to [ADDRESS_928179]  been well -tolerated on normal skin and on skin displaying 
the underlying pathology of acne or atopic dermatitis  (AD) .  In the most recent study, 37 subjects 
with mild to moderate AD were treated with either vehicle or BTX 1204 4% (w/w) BID for 28 
consecut ive days.  Evidence of a potential therapeutic benefit of BTX 1204 over vehicle was 
observed through at reduction in the Signs of AD  scores  from Baseline.  
This study is intended to establish safet y, tolerability  and efficacy  in subjects  with moderate AD 
treated BID with BTX 1204 4% (w/w) Liquid Formulation compared to subjects treated with 
Vehicle for [ADDRESS_928180] with other 
immunoglobulin E (I gE)-dependent atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, and 
food allergy. [Nowicki 2015]  The disease is  a skin disorder which presents itself as itchy, inflamed, 
red, and possibly lichenified ( i.e. thickened) skin with affected areas potentially distributed widely 
over the body . [National Eczema Organization, 2017]    The pathogenesis of the disease is thought 
  Page 21 
Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version 1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  to involve an acute T -helper 2 (Th2) cell response followed by a chronic response involving 
additional T -helper populations; although more recent research suggests that Th2 cells and a more 
generalized T -cell response are present during  both acute and chronic phases. [Gandhi 2017] The 
importance of Th2 cells and interleukin (IL) -4 and IL -13 signaling in the dis ease is supported by 
[CONTACT_684919][INVESTIGATOR_12458], a human monoclonal antibody specific to IL -4Rα that can block 
IL-4 and IL -13 signaling , to improve many symptoms of AD including pruritus, and reduction in 
AD area and severity . [Gandhi 2017]   
The classi cal steps of AD pathogenesis are the following ( Figure 1 ): 
• A skin barrier defect or entry of a skin irritant triggers the release of IL -25, IL -33, and 
thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) from keratinocytes, which activate dendritic cells 
(antigen -presenting cells in the skin) and Langerhans cells. 
• During the “acute phase” of onset, dendritic cells cause excessive Th2, T -helper 22 
(Th22) , and T -helper 17 (Th17)  cell activation  (note that these changes continue into the 
“chronic phase” of the disease) .    
o Th2 cells produce IL -4, IL -13, and IL -31, which then induce changes in 
keratinocyte gene expression, disrupt skin barrier function, and trigger itch 
symp toms.  IL -4 and IL -14 can increase additional TSLP release from 
keratinocytes, which causes further Th2 cell activation.   
o Activated Th22 cells release IL -22 which promote s keratinocyte hyperplasia, 
downregulates keratinocyte differentiation, and synergize s with IL -17 to induce 
pro-inflammatory S100 genes.   
o Activated Th17 cells release IL -17 which can regulate S100 protein and gene 
expression .  
• During the chronic stage (day [ADDRESS_928181]), dendritic cells recruit T -helper 1 (Th1) cell 
populations via  IL-12 and continue to recruit Th22 and Th17 cells.  Th1 cells release 
interferon -γ (IFN -γ), which may decrease the role of  Th2 cells  in the disease.  Th1, Th22, 
and Th17 cells induce responses that continue to attract additional immune cells to the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], alter keratinocyte differentiation, and induce epi[INVESTIGATOR_81184].

It is estimated that Th2 cell response is dominant in ~80% of AD cases (extrinsic AD), but in other 
instances (intrinsic AD ), there is a shift to a more pronounced Th22 and Th17 response . [D’Erme 
2017]  A recent study suggests that IL -[ADDRESS_928182] a more dominant role in AD than pr oposed in 
classical models [Tan 2017] : 
• Compared to healthy children, IL -17 protein levels were elev ated in AD skin lesions, but 
not in the serum of children with AD , indicating that IL -17 acts locally .   
• The effects of 2,4 -dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB; used to induce a model of AD in mice) 
were evaluated in IL -17 knockout and in wild -type C57Bl/6 mice.  D NCB was able to 
induce AD -like lesions in both types of mice; however, epi[INVESTIGATOR_684900] -17 knockout mice were significantly decreased compared to what 
was observed in wild- type mice.   
• Skin mRNA levels of the Th2 cytokines IL -4 and IL -13 were decreased in IL -17 
knockout mice compared to wild- type mice; however, there was no difference in skin 
mRNA expression levels of IFN -γ.  Splenocytes isolated from naïve IL -17 knockout mice 
released less IL -4 following conca navalin A (ConA) stimulation  (a model of T -cell 
activation) compared to splenocytes from treated wild- type mice.  
IL-17 has been shown to trigger a pro- inflammatory response in an immortalized human 
keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT cells) .  The addition of  IL-17 incre ased the release of  pro-
inflammatory  IL-6 and IL -8, but not IL -1β.  This suggests that IL -17 may play a key role in the 
immune response associated with AD.

Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version 1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  1.2.2. Rationale for the Development of BTX 1204 for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis  
The published literature suggests that CBD can potentially address the underlying immunological 
pathways and inflammatory response associated with AD.  CBD has been  shown to alter gene 
expression of antigen- primed T -cells to induce a state of anergy via  the Erg2 pathwa y and induce 
gene expression changes that lea ds to decreased antigen recognition in B -cells in an autoimmune 
disease model with a predominant Th17 response . [Kozela 2015 ] This suggests that CBD was able 
to decrease primed T -cell activity and also inhibit s ubsequent B -cell response.  CBD also altered 
gene expression in gingival stem cells to reduce antigen expression, thereby [CONTACT_684920] (Libro 2016), which could also provide 
a rationale for the use of CBD as a possible therapy for GvHD . [Yeshurun 2015a, Yeshurun 2015b]  
CBD  was also shown to suppress multiple T -cell populations and inhibit general T -cell activation .  
[Faubert Kaplan 2003, Ignatowska -Jankowska 2009]  Numerous  experimental models ha ve 
indicated that CBD can decrease concentrations of pro -inflammatory mediators and also increase 
the release of anti -inflammatory cytokines (such as IL -10).  CBD has also been shown to directly 
inhibit inflammatory responses due to the addition of IL -17A or IFN-γ. [De Filippis  2011, Harvey 
2014]  The potential for  CBD to inhibit the effects of IFN -γ and/or decreasing IFN -γ levels could 
serve a dual purpose; lower levels of IFN -γ could translate to a decreased inflammatory response 
and improve skin barrier f unction by [CONTACT_684921] -γ-mediated inhibition of long -chain fatty acid 
ceramide production in the skin. [Tawada 2014]  
Importantly, the literature indicate s that CBD can inhibit the migration, proliferation and cell 
maturation processes involved in Th17, Th1, and Th2 immune response s. [Kozela 2015, Kozela 
2016, L ee 2016]  These are considered critical immune pathways involve d in the pathophysiology 
of AD. [Guttman -Yassky 2017]  CBD  may have beneficial effects on AD due to direct antioxidant 
effects, and abilit y to improve antioxidant status in models of inflammation and autoimmune 
disease. [Ben Shabat 2006, Booz 2011, De Filippis  2011, Fouad  2011,  Mukhopadhyay 2011,  
Fouad 2012, Giacoppo 2015, Lee 2016]  Finally , CBD may also provide a therapeutic benefit for 
the treatment of AD by [CONTACT_684922].  CBD 
inhibited the production of monocyte chemotactic protein -2 (MCP -2), IL -6, IL -8, and tumor 
necrosis factor -α in polyinosinic -polycytidylic a cid stimulated human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells. 
[Petrosino 2018]   CBD has also been shown to directly inhibit the proliferation of keratinocytes . 
[Wilkinson 2007] .  The potential mechanisms  for CBD activity in AD are listed in  Table 1.  
Table 1  Potential Mechanisms of Cannabidiol as a Treatment for Atopic Dermatitis  
Atopic Dermatitis  
• Decrease differentiation and proliferation and activity of t-helper 1, 2, and 17 cells.  
• Decrease interferon- γ and IL -17 levels and downstream effects.  
• Decrease interferon- γ, which may have an inflammatory effect and improve ceramide 
production in the skin.  The latter may prevent deterioration of skin barrier fun ction.  
• Decrease monocyte chemotactic protein-2 (MCP -2), IL -6, IL -8, and tumor necrosis factor -α. 
• Decrease keratinocyte proliferation.  
• Increase intracellular expression of antioxidants and decrease reactive oxygen species.  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_928183] 
in the identified publications, some caution is warranted when trying to evaluate the potential 
effects of CBD for AD based on data from different autoimmune inflammatory disease models, as 
the unde rlying cause of the diseases models could differ.  For example, CBD had definitive effects 
on inhibiting IL17 release, decreasing Th17 cell activity and gene expression activity in an in vitro 
model of autoimmune encephalitis; however, CBD did not have any  effects on antigen -mediated 
TNF -α or INF -γ release in this same model . [Kozela 2013, Kozela 2015, Kozela 2016]  Similarly , 
in a murine model of type 1 diabetes, CBD was reported to inhibit Th1- mediated autoimmunity, 
but shift an immune response towards Th2 immunity, which was considered beneficial for the 
disease. [Weiss 2008]  It is unclear whether CBD would induce a shift in T -cell populations in AD.  
Although there were subtle differences in how specific pathways were affected by [CONTACT_684923], over all, CBD did demonstrate notable effects on inhibiting autoimmune responses in the 
test systems evaluated.  
An additional consideration needs to be given to a specific mechanism of action for CBD.  While 
not thoroughly investigated in each case, many of the se studies showed that the reported effects of 
CBD are  likely to be independent of cannabinoid receptors (CB 1 or CB 2).  Additional receptors 
that could be involved with CBDs effects on immune response and inflammation could be 
peroxisome proliferator -activ ated receptors (PPARs ), adenosine A 2 receptors, or the transient 
receptor potential cation channel subfamily V1  (TRPV1 ).  [De Filippis  2011, Esposito 2011, 
Hegde  2011,  Ribe iro 2012, Petrosino 2018]  However , the involvement of specific receptors is 
likely d ifferent for each model of autoimmune inflammation.        
1.2.3. BTX [ADDRESS_928184] identical siloxane -based  
formulation known as  BTX 1503.  The only difference between these formulations is that BTX 
1503 contains a very small amount of polydimethylsiloxane  (dimethicone) at 1.0% (w/w).  
Comparative in vitro biopharmaceutic studies have shown both formulations have comparable 
transdermal permeation rates and equivalent deposition into the e pi[INVESTIGATOR_684901] .  
To date, Botanix  Pharmaceuticals has performed a full battery of genotoxicity studies, an ocular 
irritation study, a single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], a 28 -day repeat -dose oral 
toxicology study in rats, 28-and 90- day dermal toxicology stud ies in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] , and a local lymph 
node assay (LLNA)  that support the safety of BTX 1204.  In addition, nonclinical information on 
systemic exposure to CBD obtained from the published scientific literature on the efficacy and 
safety pharmacology, on PK and metabolism, and on toxicity support the safety of CBD.  
  Page 25 
Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version 1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  The results from these studies along with a comprehensive review of the scientific literature has 
established the safety profile of CBD and supports  the proposed clinical investigation 
(BTX.2018.003 ) with topi[INVESTIGATOR_684902].  Details on the observations 
from Botanix  Pharmaceuticals’  studies and the extensive literature review can be found in the IB.   
In addition, to the nonclinical data, the safety and tolerability of BTX 1 204 4% (w/w) was 
evaluated in subjects with mild to moderate AD  (BTX.2017.004) .  In this study, BTX 1 204 4% 
(w/w) Solution or Vehicle was  applied to a target AD lesion and surrounding skin BID (180 mg 
CBD/day) for 28 consecutive days .  
Safety was assessed through collection of AEs, laboratory findings (CBC, chemistry, and 
urinalysis) , urine drug tests conducted to detect the presence of THC, signs of AD  score on the 
target lesion (erythema, exudation, excoriation, induration/papulation, and lichenification), and 
cutaneous tolerability assessments . 
This study demonstrated that daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_684903] 1204 4% (w/w) Solution BID was 
safe and well tolerated.  No early discontinuations occurred as a result of an AE.  There were no 
SAEs reported and the most common AEs were  general disorders and administration site 
conditions including application site erythema, application site pruritus, and application site pain. 
In studies conducted with BTX 1503, a formulation similar to BTX 1204 but with a drug load of 
5% (w/w), facial dryness and facial itchiness were reported as possible effects of the study drug 
treatment in a healthy volunteer study (BTX.2017.001). In an acne study (BTX.2017.002), slight 
to moderate erythema was repo rted most frequently in cutaneous tolerability assessments.  
However, most subjects that reported erythema pre -or post -study drug application had erythema 
at Baseline and treatment with BTX [ADDRESS_928185] had 
increased erythema from Baseline and this was reported at Day  35, seven days after their final 
application of study drug.  Slight scaling was reported in 2 subjects (9.5%), slight dryness was 
reported in 4 subjects (19.0%) and slight burning/stinging was reported in 5 subjects (23.4%).  
Only one positive cutaneous tolerability assessment (slight dryness) was reported at more than a 
single visit.  
There is adequate support for evaluating the use of BTX 1204 4% (w/w) Liquid Formulation in 
this clinical study based on the findings observed in nonclinical and clinical studies conducted by 
[CONTACT_684924].

Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version 1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits  
1.3.1. Known Potentia l Risks  
Based on studies conducted by [CONTACT_684925] 1204 4% and similar CBD 
products , the potential risks associated with BTX 1204 include:  
• Ocular irritation  
• Local application site AE’s  
• Cutaneous reactions which may include erythema, dry ness, scaling, and burning/stinging.   
In the current study, subjects will be allowed to use their usual moisturizers.  Subjects in this study 
will be given instructions on what to do if BTX  1204 liquid  accidentally gets into the eyes  via a 
provided “ patient  instruction” video.   
In the published scientific literature, the only target organ for toxicity that has been identified was 
the testes in rat and monkey studies.  It is uncertain if the reduction in spermatogenesis noted in 
these animal studies h as a clinical correlate.  In addition, this finding was not observed in the 28-
day oral rat study or in the  28- or 90-day dermal minipig stud ies conducted with Botanix 
Pharmaceuticals’ BTX 1503.   
The other aspect of systemic exposure to CBD reported in the published scientific literature was 
the potential for competitive binding to CYP450 isozymes, indicating a potential for drug -drug 
interactions.  Given the limited systemic exposure observed in Botanix Pharmaceuticals’ healthy 
volunteer study , the potential for a drug -drug interactio n is considered to be minimal.  
1.3.2. Known Potential Benefits  
This study is the second study in evaluating  the use of BTX 1204 4%  (w/w) in subjects  with AD.  
The preliminary efficacy of BTX  1204 4% (w/w) was evaluated in a Phase 1b, randomized, 
double -blind, vehicle -controlled study.  After only 4 weeks of treatment, subjects receiving BTX 
1204 4% (w/w) had improvements in the Signs of AD  score compared to treatment with V ehicle.    
A total of 34.8% of subjects receiving BTX 1204 had a ≥ 4- point improvement in the Signs of AD  
score compared to 18.2% of subjects receiving vehicle.  Improvement was observed primarily in 
erythema, exudation and lichenification.   
Based on the non- clinical and accumulating clinical data, the re is evidence that treatment with 
BTX 1204 4%  (w/w) in subjects  with AD may lead to decreased inflammation which may lead to 
a decrease in the signs and symptoms associated with AD.  As with any new form of treatment, 
potential benefits are not guaranteed.   Results from this study will provide guidance for additional 
safety and efficacy studies in AD and potentially  other target patient populations.

5.1. Study Drug   
5.1.1. Acquisition  
Study drug will be provided to the US study sites by [CONTACT_119372] (TCG) in Bastrop, [LOCATION_007], 
[LOCATION_003] and to the Australian sites by P CI Pharma Services (P CI) in Port Melbourne, Victoria, 
Australia.  Initial shipments will be made to supply the study sites prior to enrollment of the first 
subject. Additional supplies will be made available as needed based on subject enrollment.  
5.1.2. Formulations, Appearance, Packaging, and Labeling 
Botanix  Pharmaceuticals ’ BTX 1204 contains the  active pharmaceu tical ingredient, cannabidiol 
(CBD) .  CBD  is a member of a broader family of compounds known as cannabinoids, a class of 
compounds originally derived from the cannabis sativa plant. [Olah 2014]   CBD is chemical ly 
synthesized  under  Good Manufacturing P ractices (GMP)  for use in this study . 
BTX 1204 4%  Liquid Formulation (active)  is a clear to slightly yellow liquid solution with a 4%  
(w/w) concentration of CBD in a formulation of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , which have been used extensively in 
other topi[INVESTIGATOR_49186].  Th ese excipi[INVESTIGATOR_684908], silicone gum, 
polypropylene glycol (PPG) 15 stearyl ether , and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) .  The solution spreads 
easily and quickly evaporates leaving the CBD on the skin.   
Each milliliter of the BTX 1204 4% (w/w)  Liquid Formulation contains 30.0 mg of CBD.  The 
Vehicle will be identical to the BTX 1204 4%  (w/w) , but without the CBD.      
Study drug , active and vehicle, will be supplied in [ADDRESS_928199] ’s AD lesions (except scalp and groin).   
Pumps for all groups will be labeled identically, except for kit number and bottle number, to 
maintain the blind.   
Study drug will be applied directly to the AD lesion and spread to cover the AD lesion and up to 
[ADDRESS_928200] 
application, study drug will be pumped into the palm of one hand and applied to the AD lesion s.  
Adequate s tudy drug will be provided in kits for daily applications ( BID) through 4 weeks 
(Day 28).  Prior to d istribution, pumps will be weighed by [CONTACT_684928].  When a subject is enrolled, the site will access 
the IWRS to receive a kit number for the first [ADDRESS_928201] at the Day 29, 
Day 57, and Day  85 Visits and weighed to monit or compliance and document doses delivered.

(used and unused) at visits 29, 57, and 85.  The clinical site staff will review the diary and count 
and weigh  used/unused pumps to ensure subject compliance with dosing.   
5.2. Study Drug  Accountability Procedures  
At each study visit the clinical site will weigh each pump dispensed to the subject and returned 
from the subject to calculate the amount (grams) of study drug used.  The investigator will keep a 
current and accurate inventory of all clinical supplies received.  These records will be reviewed at  
each monitoring visit performed by [CONTACT_684929].  In case of drug accountabilities 
discrepancies (missing  pump, lost pump or non- compliance cases in which more product  was used 
compared to expected use) , investigators should obtain more information and explanation from the 
subjects.

to continue the study without additional treatment for the lesion areas , or if they require systemic 
treatment, the appropriate treatment should be administered.  Exacerbation of AD will be recorded 
as an AE .  The site will notify the study monitor immediately if this occurs.  The subject ’s 
continuation on the study will be decided on a case -by-case basis.  
6.7. Subject  Access to Study Agent at Study Closure  
Subjects  will not have access to the study drug after completion of their participation until the 
product is available commercially.

Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version  1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  7. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.1. Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1. Definition of Adverse E vents (AE)  
An AE is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a study subject  which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study treatment.  An AE can therefore be 
any unfavor able and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of study drug  treatment, whether or not considered 
related to the study drug .   
Any events involving illnesses or injuries with onset during the study or any events involving 
exacerbations of pre- existing illnesses should be recorded.  All clearly related signs and symptoms 
should be grouped together and recorded as a single diagnosis in the eCRF .  A pre -existing 
condition will not be reported as an AE  unless the condition worsens during the trial.  The 
condition, however, must be reported in the Medical History section of the e CRF. Scheduled or 
planned diagnostic and therapeutic procedures such as surgery will not be reported as AE s.   
7.1.2. Definition  of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
Each AE will be independently judged by [CONTACT_684749] .  A serious AE  
(SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684910] , 
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body 
structure,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude any one of th e outcomes listed in 
this definition.

Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version  1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  7.2. Classification of Adverse Events  
7.2.1. Relationship to Study Drug 
The investigator  will review each event and assess its  relationship (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, 
probably, definitely)  to drug treatment.  The following definitions will be used for these causality 
assessments.  
Unrelated  • The AE must clearly be caused by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, or the 
study procedure/conditions. 
• Definitely not related to drug.  
• Temporal sequence of an AE onset relative to administration of drug 
not reasonable.  
• Another obvious cause of an AE.  
Unlikely  • Time sequence is unreasonable.  
• There is another more likely cause for an AE.  
Possibly  • Corresponds to what is known about the drug.  
• Time sequence is reasonable.  
• Could have bee n due to another equally, likely cause. 
Probably  • Is a known effect of the drug.  
• Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable.  
• Ceases on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478].  
• Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_78456] ’s clinical state.  
Definitely  • Is a known effect of the drug (e.g., listed in IB). 
• Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable.  
• Event stops upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21395], event returns upon restarting drug.  
NOTE: Re -challenge will only be considered after consultation with 
the medical monitor and the sponsor. 
 
  Page 51 
Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version  1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  7.2.2. Severity of Event  
Each sign or symptom reported will be graded on a 5-point severity scale (Grade 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).   
The following definitions for r ating severity will be used: 
Grade 1  
 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  
 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive  intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.*  
Grade 3  
 Severe or medically significant but not immediat ely life -threatening; 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684731]; disabling; 
limiting s elf-care activities of daily living.**  
Note : An experience may be severe but may not be serious, ( e.g., severe 
headache).  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
Note:  A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
*Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self -care activities of daily living refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.  
7.2.3. Expectedness  
For this study, all AEs  will be recorded.   
The safety and tolerability of BTX 1204 4%  (w/w) Solution was evaluated in a Phase 1 b study in 
subjects with mild to  moderate atopic dermatitis.  Th is study demonstrated that BTX 1204 4% was 
safe and well tolerated with up to 3  mL applied BID for up to 28 days.  Adverse events reported 
as related to study drug treatments were administration site conditions including application site 
erythema, application site pruritus, and application site pain. 
Studies of the active ingredient (CBD) administered orally in multiple therapeutic settings has 
described no consistent findings for systemic AEs.  Based on findings in previous studies of CBD , 
mild skin irritation may occur  (see IB for details) . 
7.3. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
All AEs occurring after signing of the consent form through completion of Day [ADDRESS_928222] treatment with study drug  will be 
considered treatment emergent AE s (TEAEs) .  At each contact [CONTACT_1155] , the investigator 
  Page [ADDRESS_928223]  presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the  criteria for SAEs will be recorded. 
Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
severity, relationship to study drug  (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] 
a diagnosis), and tim e of resolution/ stabilization  of the event. All AEs occurring while on study 
must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate 
resolution.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject  is screened w ill be recorded in 
the Medical H istory eCRF and will be considered as B aseline and not reported as an AE. However, 
if the study subject ’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an 
AE.  
Changes in the severit y of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the 
event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized  as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
7.4. Reporting Procedures  
7.4.1. Adverse Events  Reporting 
All AEs will be recorded on the AE eCRF.  For each AE, the name [CONTACT_12581], date of onset, 
relationship to study drug, severity, seriousness (Y/N), whether a medication was used to treat the 
event, date of resolution (or ongoing), and outcome (fatal, recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved 
with sequelae, ongoing) will be noted. 
7.4.2. Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Each AE will be independently judged by [CONTACT_684749] .  A SAE is 
defined in Section 7.1.2.  
All SAEs will be reported to the sponsor  via e- mail or phone call  within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event, whether or not the serious events are deemed drug -related.  All serio us event 
reporting will adhere to 21  CFR  312.32 for Investigational New Drugs (IND) and to the Guidance 
for Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and 
Bioavailability/Bioequivalence, dated December 2012. The HREC /IRB  will be not ified of the 
Alert Reports.  
All AEs will be followed until resolution or until the investigator determines that  the subject ’s 
status has returned to normal  or has stabilized . 
  Page [ADDRESS_928224] ’s permission. Pregnancy will be follo wed until the 
outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e. miscarriage, abortion or birth), and the newborn condition 
is reported.  No further follow up is required after birth unless specifically requested by [CONTACT_35011]. It will be the responsibility of the study’s Medical Monitor to follow the subject  after the 
subject ’s withdrawal from the study.   
7.5. Safety Oversight  
Oversight of the safety of the study will be the responsibility of the Medical Monitor.  No Data 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be c onvened for this study.  Safety data will be regularly 
reviewed (monthly at a minimum).  If unexpected safety signals are observed, the Medical 
Monitor, the sponsor, and the HR EC/IRB , if necessary, will determine if the study requires a pause 
to further as sess the safety signal or termination.     
  Page [ADDRESS_928225] 
of the study  is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and 
with applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_17650].   
On-site monitoring will occur for initial site assessment and training throughout the study  and at a 
frequency adequate to assess the above based on the number of subjects  enrolled at each site and 
the time from enrollment of the subjects .  Comprehensive source data verification (100% ) will be 
conducted.  The monitor should have access to laboratory test reports and other subject  records 
needed to verify the entries on the Case Report Form.  The investigator (or his/her designee) agrees 
to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any pr oblems detected during these monitoring visits 
are resolved.  
A site visit monitoring report will be prepared for each visit.  The sponsor  will be provided copi[INVESTIGATOR_684911] 10 days of visit.  
Details of clinical site monitoring are documented in the Clinical Monitoring Plan  (CMP ). The 
CMP describes in detail who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be 
done, at what level of detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring 
reports.  
Independent audits may be  conducted by [CONTACT_684934], the sponsor, or regulatory 
agencies  to ensure monitoring practices are performed consistently across all participating sites 
and that monitors are following the CMP.

Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version  1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared for this study.  The statistical 
approaches to analysis of the data are summarized  in this protocol.  Further detail on the structure 
of tables, lis tings, and figures is provided in the SAP.   
9.2. Statistical Hypotheses  
The purpose of this Phase 2a study is to describe the safety and efficacy of treatment with the BTX 
1204 4% Liquid Formulation vs Vehicle with BID dosing in subjects with moderate atopic 
dermatitis.  E xploratory analysis  of the study drug ’s effect on  AD will be evaluated .  None of these 
assessments will use hypothesis testing to assess their treatment effect.   
Should any post -hoc statistical analyses be conducted to present study outcomes, the methods for 
analysis will be described in the final clinical study report.   
9.3. Description of Statistical Methods  
9.3.1. General Approach  
This study will be evaluated using 3 analy sis sets: intent -to-treat (ITT), per protocol (PP), and 
safety.  Efficacy conclusions will be drawn from the ITT analysis set.  The ITT analysis set will 
consist of all randomized subjects with at least one post -baseline efficacy assessment and will be 
based on randomized study group, regardless of study drug received.  The PP analysis set will be 
used to support the efficacy findings in the ITT analyses and will include subjects  with no major 
protocol deviations.  Safety conclusions will be drawn from the safety analysis set.  The safety 
analysis set will include all subjects that received at least one application of study drug and had at 
least one post -baseline safety assessment with treatment based on study drug received regardless 
of randomization group.   
Demographics will be summariz ed using the safety analysis set by [CONTACT_347704], gender, race, 
ethnicity , height , and weight.  The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on the ITT 
population.  For continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation (SD), median , and range will 
be presented along with the 95% confidence interval  (CI).   Categorical variables will be 
summariz ed by [CONTACT_684734] 95% CI. 
9.3.2. Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will include summaries of AEs, TEAEs, serious AEs (SAEs),  and changes in 
laboratory assessments.  AEs, TEAEs and SAEs will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary and 
summarize d by [CONTACT_1570], the number of subjects  reporting events, system organ class, 
preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness. A list of  subjects  who 
  Page [ADDRESS_928226]  will be listed.  
9.3.3. Efficacy Analys es 
The efficacy variables include the IGA, BSA of AD, Signs of  AD score, EASI s core, and pruritus 
scores (I -NRS)  collected at Screening/Baseline and all subsequent study visits  and the WI -NRS 
recorded  daily  by [CONTACT_1766] .  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the study is  the proportion of subjects with IGA success defined 
as an IGA score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) with at least a 2 -grade improvement from Baseline 
at Day 85.  The IGA will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” at study Day 15, Day 29, 
Day 57, and Day 85.  Success on IGA defined as a score of Cl ear (0) or Almost Clear  (1) and at 
least a 2 -grade improvement from Baseline at Day 15, Day 29, Day 57, and Day  85 will be 
analyzed using logistic regression, adjusting for Baseline IGA.   
Summary statistics will be prepared for the change from Baseline in  the percent of BSA affected 
by [CONTACT_684935] 15, 29, 57 , and 85.  The change from Baseline in BSA of AD will be analyzed used 
ANCOVA with Baseline BSA of AD and treatment as covariates.   
Summary statistics will be pre sented for the change from baseline in each  of the  Signs of AD 
scores (erythema, exudation, excoriation, induration/papulation, and lichenification) at each 
timepoint (Day 15, Day 29, Day 57 and Day 85).  A total score will be calculated based on the 
sum of each of the Signs of AD (0, 1, 2, or 3; max score of 15) and the chang e from baseline will 
be summaris ed for each timepoint.  The change from baseline in Signs of AD  score at Day 15, Day 
29, Day 57, and Day  85 will be analyzed used ANCOVA with Baseline Signs of AD score and 
treatment as covar iates.   
The proportion of subjects with an EASI 50 and EASI 75 score will be summarized at Day 15, 
Day 29, Day 57, and Day  85 and compared using logistic regression, adjusting for Baseline EASI 
score.  Summary statistics will be prepared for the change from B aseline in the EASI s core and 
I-NRS at each timepoint (Day 15, Day 29, Day 57 and Day 85).  
Summary statistics will be prepared for the change from B aseline in the Signs of AD  score for the 
target lesion (selected sites)  at each timepoint (Day 15, Day 29, Day 57 and Day 85).

Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version  1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  Summaries of the pruritus scores  (WI-NRS)  reported by [CONTACT_684936] p resentations.   
The percent change from Baseline the EASI will be presented along with the subject’s report of 
pruritus obtained from the Patient Diary .  Time to improvement of pruritus and subject’s 
assessment of the change in their AD from Baseline to Day  85 will be presented.  
9.3.4. Adherence and Retention Analyses  
Compliance with study drug administration will be summarized  based on dosing information from 
the clinical sites and based on the  diary information obtained from subjects .  Subjects  who drop-
out from the study for any reason will be summarized .   
9.3.5. Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
Demographics /Baseline characteristics  will be summari zed by [CONTACT_654], gender, race, ethnicity , height , 
weight , and BSA of AD.   The year of AD diagnosis will be cap tured to calculate and summarize  
the duration of AD.  
9.3.6. Planned Interim Analyses  
No formal interim analysis is planned.  Blinded subject  data will be reviewed as it is generated to 
monitor for any safety signals and to ensure that the study is being appropria tely executed.  
9.3.7. Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity  
This Phase 2a study is designed to identify the response to BTX 1204 relative to vehicle.  Statistical 
tests applied to the outcomes will be exploratory.  No adjustments for Type  1 error will occur .   
9.3.8. Handling of Missing Data  
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data in the ITT analysis set will be based on 
LOCF .  Other imputation methods (e.g., mixed model for repeated measurement [MMRM]) may 
be used as  sensitivity analys es.  
All s afety analyses will be  conducted using  the safety analysis set. No imputation s will be made 
for missing safety data.  
9.3.9. Tabulation of Individual Response Data  
Individual response data will be presented in data listings.     
9.4. Sample Size  
The sample size for this study i s based on clinical considerations only.  Subjects will be 
randomized 1:1 with 100 subjects in each treatment group for a total 200 subjects.  This is 
considered adequate to evaluate the safety and tolerability and preliminary information on efficacy

70 years of age .    
9.5. Measures  to Minimize  Bias 
9.5.1. Enrollment/Randomization/Masking Procedures  
A randomization code will be prepared by [CONTACT_89813].  This statistician will be the 
only person aware of the randomization code.  Randomization will be 1 :1 (100 active:  100 vehicle) 
and done by [CONTACT_3725].  Once a subject  is deemed eligible to enroll,  randomizat ion will occur.  T he site 
will contact [CONTACT_684937] /bottle  number (s) to be used for that subject  throughout the 
study.   
Study drug, active or vehicle, will be labelled identically except for the kit/bottle  number s.  All 
bottles of study dru g will contain 100 mL of  either BTX 1204 4%  (w/w) Liquid Formulation or 
Vehicle.  The vehicle study drug is indistinguishable from the active study drug.     
9.5.2. Breaking the Study Blind/ Subject  Code  
During the study, the randomization  code will not be broken except in the case of a safety concern, 
either for an individual subject  or for the entire study.  
If a subject  has an adverse event that may necess itate unblinding of the randomization code, the 
site will contact [CONTACT_684756].  If the 
site and sponsor agree that unblinding is in the best interests of the subject , the unblinded 
statistician  will be contact[CONTACT_684938].  Sealed, unblinding envelopes will be 
maintained at the investigators’ site only for circumstances where the CRO or sponsor cannot be 
contact[CONTACT_684939].   
At the completion of the study, the blind will be broken only after all data on all subjects  have  
been entered into the database and the database is locked.  Database lock procedures will follow 
Premier Research  SOPs.  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_928227] SOPs for quality management 
that describe:  
• How data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol, ethical standards, regulatory 
compliance, and accuracy in relation to source documents.  
• The documents to be reviewed (e.g., eCRF s, clinic notes, produc t accountability records, 
specimen tracking logs, questionnaires, audio or video recordings), who is responsible, and 
the frequency for reviews.  
• Who will be responsible for addressing QA issues (e.g., correcting procedures that are not 
in compliance with protocol) and QC issues (e.g., correcting errors in data entry).  
• Staff training methods and how such training will be tracked.  
• If applicable, calibration exercises conducted prior to and during the study to train 
examiners and maintain acceptable intra- and inter -examiner agreement.  
QC procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that 
will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be 
communicated to the site(s) for clarifica tion/resolution.  
Following written SOPs, the clinical study monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted 
and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, 
GCP, and the applicable regulatory requireme nts (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good 
Manufacturing Practices (GMP)).

This research will be carried out in accordance with the protocol, the ICH harmonized tripartite 
guideline regarding GCP  (E6 Consolidated Guidance, June 1996), the National Statement on 
Ethical Conduct in Human Research (updated May 2015), and the ethical principles set forth in 
the Declaration of Helsinki.  
11.1. Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations  
11.1.1. Informed Consent/Assent Process  
It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093] (if acceptable 
by [CONTACT_427]), to obtain written informed consent/assent from each subject participating in 
this study after adequate explanation of the aims, m ethods, objectives and potential hazards of the 
study.  It must also be explained to the subjects that they are completely free to refuse to enter the 
study or to withdraw from it at any time for any reason.  In states or institutions where permission 
is required from a legal guardian and the child is required to assent to participate, the appropriate 
assent -permission process will be followed according to the relevant local and/or state laws.  
Appropriate IRB/EC -approved forms for obtaining written informe d consent/assent will be 
provided by [CONTACT_684758].   
The case report forms for this study contain a section for documenting informed consent/assent 
and this must be completed appropriately.  If new safety information r esults in significant changes 
in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent/assent form will be reviewed and updated if necessary.  
All subjects (including those already being treated) will be informed of the new information, given 
a copy of the revised form  and be re -consented/assented to continue in the study.  
11.1.2. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)  
This protocol, the informed consent/assent form and any accompanying material provided to the 
subject (such as subject information sheets or desc riptions of the study used to obtain informed 
consent/assent) as well as any advertising or compensation given to the subject, will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_1201]/EC, and the study will not start until the IRB/EC has approved the protocol or a 
modification thereof .  The IRB/EC is constituted and operates in accordance with the principles 
and requirements described in [ADDRESS_928228] 
in Human Research (updated May 2015).  
Protocol modifications to this study must be made only after consultation between an appropriate 
representative of the sponsor and the investigator.  Protocol amendments must be prepared and 
approved by [CONTACT_684940]/EC prior to implementation. 
11.1.3. Subject and Data Confi dentiality  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, and the 
sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples 
  Page [ADDRESS_928229] party without 
prior w ritten approval of the sponsor.  
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, or representatives of the 
IRB/EC may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], 
including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records for 
the subjects in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
The study subject’s contact [CONTACT_21225]. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location 
as described in Section 12.1.1.  
Study subject  research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, 
will be transmitted to and stored at the CRO. This will not include the subject’s contact [CONTACT_10415]. Rather, individual subjects and their research dat a will be identified by a 
unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by 
[CONTACT_684760]’ research staff will be secured and password protected. At 
the end of the study, all study data bases will be de- identified and archived at the CRO and 
ultimately with the sponsor.  
11.1.4. Research Use of Stored Human Samples, Specimens or Data  
Samples and data collected under this protocol will be used to study the safety of the study drug, 
BTX 1503 liquid formulation. No genetic testing will be performed.  Samples and data will be 
stored using codes assigned by [CONTACT_145429], the CROs, and/or the laboratories assessing 
the samples. Data will be kept in password- protected computers. Only those enti ties participating 
in the study will have access to the samples and data.  
The study involves taking digital photographs of a target lesion  at selected sites. The subject or 
subject’s parent/guardian will consent/assent, in advance of any photographs being  taken, to the 
taking, copyright, publication, and use of their photographs.  The subject’s face will not be 
included in the photos . The photographs will be part of the study record and will be sent to the 
sponsor and regulatory agencies. The photographs w ill only be linked to the subject’s study code 
and not the subject’s name.   
11.1.5. Future Use of Stored Specimens  
All blood and urine samples used for assessment or study drug safety will be destroyed after 
analysis.  No specimens will be stored for future use. 
11.1.6. Key Roles and Study Administration  
The sponsor of this study is Botanix Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Botanix).  Botanix has engaged Premier 
Research (Durham, North Carolina, US) to oversee the conduct of the study.  Premier will conduct 
  Page 62 
Protocol BTX.2018.003 Version  1.0 21-AUG-2018  CONFIDENTIAL  the data management, clinical monitoring and statistical management of the study.  The medical 
monitor for this study will be provided by [CONTACT_684761].  His/her responsibility will be to oversee the 
safety of subjects in the study.   
The IRB/EC, which protects the rights and welfare of s ubjects, will be either local or centralized 
based on the study site.  Central IRBs will be preferentially used when possible.  Clinical sites 
outside of the US, will have IRB/EC oversight based on local and national requirements.  
Photography of a target l esion  at selected sites will be performed utilizing equipment from a 
photography vendor.  The vendor will provide a Photography Manual describing correct 
techniques for photographing subjects.  Photographs from the study are the property of Botanix 
and wil l become part of the study record.   
Study drug will be manufactured and distributed in Australia by [CONTACT_684941].  In  the [LOCATION_002] , The Coghlan Group (TCG; Bastrop, [LOCATION_007], [LOCATION_003]) is 
responsible for packaging, labeling, and distribution of the study drug  for US sites .  
A qualified vendor will act as the central lab for analysis of the blood and urine samples.  Results 
will be provided to the sites for their subject management and to Premier for data analysis.   
There will be n o DSMB for this study.  Blinded safety data will be reviewed in real -time by [CONTACT_684762].  
  Page [ADDRESS_928230] is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment -
limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome.  The 
investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to the 
sponsor in the eCRF’s and in all required reports.  
Clinical data (inc luding AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and 
clinical laboratory data will be entered into the electronic data capture (EDC) system, a [ADDRESS_928231]’s official study record.  
The investigator shall supply the sponsor or its designee on request with any required background 
data from the study documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly important when data on 
the electronic Case Report Forms requires clarification.  In  case of special problems/and or 
governmental queries or requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the 
complete study records, provided that subject confidentiality is protected.  
Source data are all information, original recor ds of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Examples 
of these original documents and data records include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinic 
and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subject s’ memory aids or evaluation checklists, 
  Page [ADDRESS_928232] of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should 
be classified into two different separate categories (1) Investigator’s Study File, and (2) Subject 
clinical source documents. The Investigator’s Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, 
Case Report and Query Forms, IRB/EC and governmental approval (as appropriate) with 
correspondence, sample informed consent/assent, study drug records, staff curriculum vitae and 
authorization forms and other appropriate documents/correspondence. All records defined in [ADDRESS_928233] of the following: completion, discontinuation of the study, or the regulatory submission for 
which the  study is being performed is no longer under review.  After that, the documents may be 
destroyed, subject to local regulations. 
Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another 
location, the sponsor must be notified in advance.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site for any or 
all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and the sponsor 
to store these in a sealed container(s) off- site so that they can be returned sealed to the investigator 
in case of a regulatory audit.  Where source documents are required for the continued care of the 
subject, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_231654].  
12.1.2. Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or other study 
requirements (e.g., SOPs, Laboratory Manuals, etc).  The noncompliance may be either on the part 
of the subject, the investigator, or the study site sta ff.  As a result of deviations, corrective actions 
are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
These practices are consistent with ICH E6:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1

IRB/EC per their guidelines. The site investiga tor/study staff is responsible for knowing and 
adhering to their IRB/EC requirements.  
It is not anticipated that waivers of eligibility requirements will be granted for any subjects.  
However, if eligibility requirements are waived in special circumstance s, waivers must be 
approved by [CONTACT_684942] a subject may be enrolled.  
Documentation of granted waivers will be maintained in the investigator’s and sponsor’s files.  
12.1.3. Publication and Data Sharing Policy  
The results of this stu dy may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  The investigator 
agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Botanix Pharmaceuticals at least [ADDRESS_928235].

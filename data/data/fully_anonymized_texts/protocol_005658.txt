Background and Significance:  
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERA S) pathways are intended to reduce physiologic 
stress of surgery and minimize organ dysfunction. ERAS pathways often include multi -modal 
patient education, early diet  advancement, early ambulation, and non -narcotic analgesia  with 
goals of earl ier return of bowel function, activity, and discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. While first 
developed for colorectal surgery, the principles of ERAS pathways have been applied to 
bariatric, urologic, gynecologic oncology, gastric, and pancreatic postsurgical pathways with 
good success.1–[ADDRESS_189379] 
(TAP) regional nerve block , can improve postoperative pain.6,[ADDRESS_189380]

demonstrated improved postoperative pain control .7–[ADDRESS_189382] patients 
benefiting primarily on the day of surgery.13 
In response to the need for improved , long -lasting  non-narcotic pain control, an extended 
release liposoma l bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (LB) was developed for use in surgical intervention . This product 
suspends bupi[INVESTIGATOR_163101] -based particle laye rs which are slowly absorbed by [CONTACT_10489], 
releasing bupi[INVESTIGATOR_163102] [ADDRESS_189383] been independently demonstrated to provide improved 
pain control over placebo, as well as improved pain control over other loc al anesthesia s as 
described above ,6,8–12,16 –21 it is unclear which may provide better analgesia for colorectal surgical 
intervention.  Currently, intravenous lidocaine is regularly used for assistance in pain control 
during colorectal surgery at this institution . This administered at the discretion of the attending 
surgeon . We hypothesize that administration of LB as a TAP block will provide longer -term and 
thus improved postoperative analgesia to patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal 
intervention, with resulting decreased narcotic use, earl ier ambulation, and earlier return of 
bowel function.  
 
Purpose of Study:  
To compare the analgesic impact of intravenous perioperative lidocaine  infusion  with 
preoperative liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_163103]. This is to be integrated into the standard ERAS 
protocol  currently utilized at Carolinas Medical Center . Primary endpoints will be  postoperative 
pain as measured by [CONTACT_163119] (VRS),  postoperative morphine equivalents utilized per 
day, and over 30 days. Secondary endpoints will include date of ambul ation, return of bowel 
function  (first flatus) , tolerance of goal diet, incidence of post -operative nausea and vomiting 
during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], length of stay  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_163104]) , post-operative morbidity (Clavien -
Dindo, related to both anesthesia and surger y), cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (operative, PACU, 
postoperative stay, and total ) and quality of life on follow up.  
 
Study Design:  
 
Enrollment of Subjects:  
Patients will be prospectively enrolled from Carolinas Medical Center Colorectal Surgery 
Outpatient Clini c and the Levine Cancer Institute Surgical Oncology Outpatient Clinic . Specific, 
IRB-approved consent will be obtained for enrollment in the study and for inclusion in the 
surgical outcomes database.  
Page 4 of 11 We will include patients 18  to 70  undergoing elective la paroscopic colon resection for 
benign or malignant disease. We will include laparoscopic, robotic assisted laparoscopic, and/or 
hand assisted cases. Cases converted to open will be included  for intention to treat analysis . 
Creation of ostomy will not precl ude enrollment.  
Patients who have a history of chronic pain  on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , currently on suboxone or 
methadone, or with a contraindication to lidocaine administration will be excluded. Planned open 
interventions as well as planned concurrent non-colorectal interventions will be excluded. 
Patients who are under [ADDRESS_189384] liver or renal dysfunction, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], psychomotor 
retardation, BMI >40, sleep apnea, or cardiac rhythm disorders,  or are pregnant will be excluded  
(image 1) . 
Patients  who have complications of Clavien -Dindo class 3 or greater will be included in 
calculations of complication rates. However, they will not be included in calculations of 
postoperative morphine equivalents, as repeat intervention will confound  the normal co urse of 
postoperative pain control.  
 
Data Collection:  
Research fellows, data analysts, and clinical research team will be responsible for 
tracking subject enrollment and compliance with protocol. Patient o utcomes and quality of life 
will be entered under a deidentified patient key in the  surgical outcomes database which is 
prospectively maintained.  
The patient key con taining PHI will be stored in a password accessed digital file on a 
limited access folder on a secure network. Access to this folder is only available to primary  
investigators  and associated staff . Password access to this file will be granted only to sub -
investigators. Computer access to this network is in an office space limited to employees during 
the working hours and requires fob access granted by [CONTACT_163120] -hours.  
Data of interest will be recorded on a deidentified spreadsheet with no linki ng patient 
information.  The spreadsheet will be kept on a limited access folder on a secure network. 
Following data collection period, all variables and data will be deidentified including during any 
subsequent data analysis or publication.  
 
Research Des ign: 
Creation of study arms:  
We plan to conduct a  single -center,  prospective, randomized, blinded study comparing 
the analgesic impact of perioperative IV lidocaine infusion with post-induction, pre -incision  LB 
TAP block. Patients will be randomized  to one  of two study  arms  using a computer -generated  
list. Allocation concealment will be ensured by [CONTACT_163121], opaque, 
sequentially numbered envelopes will be opened upon arrival of the patient in the operating 
room. Postoperative outcomes will be assessed by [CONTACT_163122].  
Groups will receive  administration of analgesia as follows:  
1. Intravenous Lidocaine infusion ( control arm, current standard of care)  n= 35 
a. 100 mg/5mL intravenous bolus of lidocaine 2% PF 5mL will be init iated by 
[CONTACT_163123].  
b. 1.5 mg/kg/hr to begin prior to incision and continue until discontinued [ADDRESS_189385] 30 
minutes after discontinuation of lid ocaine drip.  
Page 5 of 11 c. Adhesive tapes will be applied at the presumed level of TAP block puncture 
sites.  
2. Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_163103] (experimental arm)  n= 35 
a. Block will be administered after induction of anesthesia  and before incision  
by a specifically trained a ttending surgeon or surgical fellow with the 
colorectal service.  
b. A single vial of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (20 mL 1.3%, 13.3mg/mL, 266 mg) 
will be diluted in 50cc bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110771] a volume of  60cc  prior to 
administration. This will be divided into 2 doses for b ilateral TAP blocks.  
c. The LB will be administered under ultrasound guidance in the transversus 
abdominis plain per manufacturer recommendations.  
d. Adhesive tapes will be applied at the level of the TAP block puncture sites.  
 
Perioperative care (ERAS):  
All patients involved in this study will be enrolled in the current CMC ERAS protocol, 
which is current standard of care at this institution. This protocol includes:  
• Nutritional supplements 1 week before surgery  
• Clear liquids up to 2 hours before surgery  
• Early  postoperative ambulation  
• Clear liquid diet available immediately postoperatively  
• Standard postoperative pain control per ERAS protocol with scheduled acetaminophen, 
gabapentin , and o pi[INVESTIGATOR_163105].  
• Early Foley  catheter removal  (POD1 unless o therwise specified)  and encouragement of 
ambulation per current ERAS  protocol.  
 
Evaluation of primary outcomes : 
Patients will report pain by [CONTACT_163124] (VRS) every [ADDRESS_189386] with every pain medication administered, as well as with vital sign checks.  After 
discharge, pain/VRS scores will be measured at [ADDRESS_189387], as all analgesic medications are recorded 
at distribution by [CONTACT_75462].  After discharge, patients will bring opi[INVESTIGATOR_163106] u p appointments for accurate recording of usage, in addition to self -reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_163107].  
 
Evaluation of secondary outcomes:  
Page 6 of 11 Secondary outcomes will be recorded and evaluated, including  date of ambulation, return 
of bowel function (first flatus), toleran ce of goal diet, incidence of post -operative nausea and 
vomiting during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], length of stay (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_163104]), post -operative morbidity 
(Clavien -Dindo, related to both anesthesia and surgery), cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (operative, 
PACU, postopera tive stay, and total) and quality of life on follow up.  
 
Evaluation of adverse outcomes:  
Postoperative outcomes will be recorded and categorized per Clavien -Dindo 
classification of surgical outcomes. Outcomes of grade III or greater will be considered majo r 
complications, and these patients will be removed from further evaluation of pain control. These 
complications will be included in total outcomes.  
 
Endpoint  
Intravenous lidocaine or TAP Block will be used as a perioperative adjunct, then at the 
conclusio n of the study chart review will be performed to evaluate if either intervention provided 
superior pain control as demonstrated by [CONTACT_163125], VAS pain scale values, return of bowel 
function, time to diet, or length of stay (LOS).

Power and Sample Size:  
Based on differences detected in prior studies , a power analysis was performed using 
postoperative pain and length of stay as the primary outcome variables. We will need 20 patients 
per group to show a clinically significant reduction in pain and total morphine equivalents  with 
80% power and type I error rate of 5%. Anticipating study withdrawals (3 -5 per group) , and 
complications requiring further intervention (3 -5 per grou p), we will enroll 35 patients per group, 
70 patients  in total.  
 
Data Analysis:  
Data will be analyzed using standard statistical methods  utilizing the SAS program 
version 9.3 (SAS, Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]). Descriptive statistics including means and standard 
deviat ions, or counts and percentages, will be used to describe the study population on all 

Page 8 of 11 variables. Patients will be grouped based on study arm. Demographic and baseline measures will 
be compared for differences between groups. For continuous variables, compa risons will be 
made between groups using t -tests and Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney tests. For categorical variables, 
Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests will be used to make comparisons between groups. For the 
primary analysis, morphine equivalents, pain scores, w eight (kg), length of operation (min.), 
estimated blood loss (cc), total cost ($), and length of postoperative stay (days) will be compared 
between groups using the same tests as outlined above; additional analyses will compare 
prevalence of peri -operative  complications between groups. Multivariate regression will be used 
to control for potential confounding variables such as age, gender, or others as identified. The 
level of significance will be set at p <0.05 for all comparisons.  
 
Risks and Benefits:  
Both  analgesic  interventions (IV lidocaine and LB TAP block) have been demonstrated 
to be superior to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -only analgesia for postoperative pain control  in multiple studies. IV 
lidocaine is routinely used for augmentation of perioperative pain control in col orectal and other 
surgical procedures at this institution.7–13 The administration of a long acting LB has the 
potential to im prove pain control for a longer period postoperatively.6,16–19 Improved 
postoperative pain control can improve patient outcomes on multiple levels, including earlier 
diet, earlier ambulation, and earlier return of bowel function.  
Adverse outcomes to administration of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_163108]. The 
side effects of these medications are directly related to the serum level. For lidocaine, side effects 
are rare at serum levels within the 2 -6 mcg/mL range. Side effects are more pronounced in 
patients with liver dysfunction, pulmonary disease s where the predominant problem is carbon 
dioxide retention, and congestive heart failure, who are therefore excluded from this study. W e 
will comply with manufacturer and FDA warnings regarding the maximum dosage of 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183]/or lidocaine.14,22,23 Multiple precautions via pharmacy, anesthesia, and OR staff 
will be taken to prevent administration of both drugs to a single patient. Other adverse events 
include accessing confidential PHI, which we hope  to prevent using the data security plan 
detailed previously.  
 
Safety Monitoring:  
The safety monitor will provide a professional opi[INVESTIGATOR_163109].  The co -investigators  and research staff  will regularly 
review and document the operative and po stoperative course of patients enrolled in the study . 
The patient will be seen daily by [CONTACT_163126]. The 
patient will also be seen or reviewed daily by [CONTACT_163127] t hey are in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . The Co -investigators will  document adverse events as follows:  
1. Any adverse events potentially related to the intervention (IV lidocaine or liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_163103]) will be reported to the safety monitor, the primary 
investigator , and the IRB within 48 hours of discovery.  
Events potentially associated with the intervention include but are not limited to:  
a. Allergic reaction to administered medication as demonstrated by [CONTACT_932], puritis, 
airway compromise, or hives.  
b. Withdrawal from the study due to adverse reaction to medication.  
Page 9 of 11 c. Events potentially associated with lidocaine or bupi[INVESTIGATOR_163110].14,23,24 
i. Not severe: perioral numbness  
ii. Mild to Moderate: severe dizziness, decreased hearing, t remors, 
changes in blood pressure and heart rate  
iii. Severe: drowsiness, confusion, muscle twitching, convulsions, loss of 
consciousness, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest  
d. Events associated with injection of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_163111].  
i. Abdominal wall swelling or bleeding in excess of appropriate post -
surgical changes  
ii. Abdominal wall bleeding requiring transfusion or intervention  
2. All adverse events not potentially related to the interventio n will be recorded and 
reviewed per Clavien -Dindo complication classifications. A list of adverse events will  
be emailed to the primary investigator and the safety monitor every 6 months for 
review . Upon review by [CONTACT_163128] r, any adverse 
events potentially associated with the interventions performed (as listed above) will 
be submitted to the IRB within [ADDRESS_189388] -track bariatric surgery improves perioperative

Page 577 of 713  Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Populations  
Safety Population: All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of IMP, according to the treatment 
received.   
Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Population: All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of IMP will be 
included, according to the treatment sequence group to which they were randomized. Per -
Protocol (PP) Population: Includes all ITT subjects without major protocol 
violations/deviations. The list of major protocol violations/deviations will be identified and 
specified prior to final database lock for the trial that would lead to exclusion for the PP 
analysis.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population: Includes all trial subjects who have at least 1 PK sample 
taken during their participation.  
Safety Analyses   
Safety analyses will include incidence of AEs and SAEs, deaths, premature discontinuation 
from the trial due to an AE (regardless of relationship to IMP), and change in ECG, clinical 
laboratory data, and vital signs.   
Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT population. In general, categorical variables 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_86195] (N) and percentage of subjects (%). Continuous variables 
will be  
11 
summarized by [CONTACT_154562] -missing observations (N), mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum values.  All trial data are to be displayed in the data 
listings. Subject disposition summaries will include the number of subjects enrolled an d the 
numbers included in the ITT populations. The number and percentage of subjects who 
complete or discontinue from the trial will be summarized by [CONTACT_41794]. 
Subject’s age, sex, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and other demograph ic 
characteristics will be recorded and summarized. Medical history will be listed.  
Two primary endpoints are included in the primary endpoint family (6MWT and BTHS -SA - 
Total Fatigue).  Hochberg’s procedure will be used to control the family -wise Type I error 
rate at 0.05 (two -sided).  No adjustments will be made to alpha levels to accou nt for 
secondary efficacy measures. Statistical analysis of this trial will be the responsibility of the 
Sponsor or its designee.  
Additional details regarding analyses will be included in separate statistical analysis plan 
(SAP). 
Sample Size  
For this Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled crossover trial followed by [CONTACT_18428] -label treatment extension assessment, a sample size of approximately [ADDRESS_270058] deviation of paired differences of 50 meters for 
the 6MWT distance and 1.3 points for the BTHS -SA Total Fatigue score12 subjects provides 
for nearly 80% power to detect a mean improvement of 50 meters in the 6MWT or 1.3 points 
for the BTHS -SA Total Fatigue score, with each potentially te sted at the 0.025 (two -sided) 
level of significance (associated with a potential adjustment via Hochberg’s procedure), in 
Elamipretide (MTP -131 for SC Injection)  
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_49840] -[ADDRESS_270059] numbers are restricted by [CONTACT_224696] (availability of subjects) 
but that recruitment could be greater if subjects are available (up to 16 subjects).

4.1. Barth Syndrome  
Barth Syndrome (BTHS, 3 -methylglutaconic aciduria type II, MIM 300394) is a rare X -
linked disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1/300,000 –400,000 live births and 
characterized by [CONTACT_224697], skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, and growth abnormalities, 
among other features ( Ades L, et al., 1993 ). BTHS is caused by [CONTACT_224698] (G4.5), which 
encodes for Tafazzin, an acyltransferase involved in the remodeling of the mitochondrial 
phospholipid cardiolipin. Cardiolipin has important roles in mitochondrial function including 
maintaining cristae structure, supporting electron transport chain efficiency, and in apoptosis. 
(Hoch F., 1992 ). Deficiency of tafazzin results in abnormal cardiolipin content, a reduction of 
structurally mature tetralinoleyl -cardiolipin (L4 -CL) and an increase in structurally immature 
monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) ( Vreken P, et al., 2000 ).  Alterations in cardiolipin structure, 
content, and acyl chain composition are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction ( Paradies 
G, et al., 2014 ). Thi s dysfunction results in reduced function and efficiency of the electron 
transport chain (ETC), affecting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and results in reduced 
ATP and likely increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Presumably, 
disorganized oxidative phosphorylation and other aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction lead 
to signs and symptoms of disease.   
The diagnosis of BTHS is suggested by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_224669] (5 - to 20 -
fold) in urinary 3 -methylglutaconic acid (3 -MGC) and other urinary metabolites. The 
diagnosis is established via detection of a TAZ pathogenic variant on molecular genetic 
testing and/or a diagnostic assay measuring the elevation of the MLCL to L4 -CL ratio 
(MLCL/L4 -CL), which is both a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic measurement in 
bloodspots, nucleated cells, and tissues ( Clark S, et al., 2013 ; Sandlers Y , et  al., 2016 ). 
BTHS is a complex inborn error of metabolism and affects many systems of the body 
(Jefferies  J., 2013 ).  Though not always present, cardinal characteristics of this multi -system 
disorder often include combinations and varying degrees of:  
• Cardiomyopathy (usually dilated cardiomyopathy [DCM] with undulating 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [HCM], sometimes with left ventricular noncompaction 
[LVNC]  
and/or endocardial fibroelastosis [EFE]). This can result in ventricular 
arrhythmias/sudden cardiac death (SCD)

weakness) resulting in exercise intolerance due to extreme fatigue  
• Growth delay (short stature in the early years, followed by [CONTACT_224699] - 
to late puberty)  
19 
• Neutropenia (can be chronic, intermittent, cyclic, or not present) resulting in 
lifethreatening bacterial infections  
• Feeding problems (e.g., difficulty sucking, swallowing, or chewing; aversion to some 
food textures; selective or pi[INVESTIGATOR_224670]; frequent vomiting)  
• Biochemical abnormalities (cardiolipin composition abnormalities and variable 
3methylglutaconic aciduria and 3 -methylglutaconic acidemia)  
No treatment is approved for the treatment of individuals with BTHS  
4.2. Pharmacologic Basis for Elamipretide as a Potential Treatment for  
BTHS  
As previously described, alterations in cardiolipin structure, content, and acyl chain 
composition are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction ( Paradies G, et al., 2014 ). This 
dysfunction results in reduced function and efficiency of the electron transport chain (ETC), 
affecting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and results in reduced A TP and likely 
increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This increase in RO S may reach a 
threshold and trigger additional increased ROS generation by [CONTACT_224700], an  effect termed 
“ROSinduced ROS release (RIRR)” ( Zorov, D. et al., 2000 ; Zorov, D, et al., 2006 ).  These 
effects constitute a positive feedback mechanism for enhanced ROS production leading to 
potentially additional significant mitochondrial structural abnormalities, dysfunction and 
cellular injury. At a certain level of mitochondrial dysfunction (d ecreased ATP and increased 
ROS productions), patients experience signs and symptoms of their disease.  
Reactive Oxygen Species also attack and denature a number of components within the 
mitochondria, including the protein components of the ETC, membrane lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (particularly 
cardiolipin), and mtDNA. In particular, the denaturing of cardiolipin has been assoc iated with 
abnormal morphology of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), less association of the 
ETC complexes within that membrane, a decline in activity of the ETC (ATP production), 
and the release of cytochrome c which initiates apoptotic signaling ( Fry, M, et al., 1981 ; 
Chicco A,  et al., 2007 ). 
Studies of BTHS patient tissues and animal models of TAZ depletion have reported 
structurally abnormal mitochondria with inefficient oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in 
decreased ATP and increased ROS levels ( Saric A, et al., 2015 ). Elamipretide may help to 
Elamipretide (MTP -131 for SC Injection)  
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_49840] -[ADDRESS_270069] due to the dysfunctional mitochondria.  The associ ation of 
elamipretide with cardiolipin has been shown to normalize key cardiolipin properties that are 
modified during oxidative stress. The proposed interaction of elamipretide with the limited 
mature cardiolipin that exists in patients with BTHS may pres erve the optimal interaction of 
the protein complexes of the ETC, improve electron flow, increase ATP production, and 
decrease ROS generation.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Pre-clinical studies  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction of aged mice  
Elamipretide has been shown to be effective in restoring A TP production in preclinical 
models of both skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction of aged mice ( Siegel M, et al., 2013 ). 
In this study, skeletal muscle energetics were measured in vivo  one hour after injection of 
either elamipretide or saline using a combination of optical and 31P magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy in old and young mice (27 months and 5 months, respectively). ATP production 
in the old mice was found to increase and to be c omparable to  that in young mice one hour 
after a single treatment with elamipretide (Figure 1).  These findings demonstrated a rapid 
reversal of agerelated declines in resting and maximal mitochondrial ATP production, 
whereas, there was no observable effect on young, healthy muscle. In the same study, 
consistent results were observed after a week of dosing with elamipretide, with a favorable 
difference in the exercise tolerance of old mice, and again no significant effect was seen in 
young mice.

Page 591 of 713  Figure 1:  ATP Production in Young (5 month) and Old (27 month) Mice Following a Single 
Treatment with Elamipretide  
 
Several reports demonstrate elamipretide’s ability to prevent skeletal muscle atrophy. For 
example, in a rat model of muscle wasting, elamipretide reduced the loss of the diaphragm 
muscle function caused by 12 hours of mechanical ventilation ( Powers S, et al., 2011 ). 
Similarly, elamipretide prevented casting -induced (i.e., immobilization) skeletal muscle 
atrophy via protecting mitochondrial function ( Talbert E, et al., 2013 ). 
21 
Additionally, in a study using a mouse model, myopathy induced by [CONTACT_224701], which induced muscle atrophy, it was shown that elamipretide protected 
both skeletal and heart muscle atrophy via prevention of mitochondrial ROS dysf unction and 
myopathy production and is, therefore, suggesting its therapeutic potential in this setting of 
myopathy ( Min K, et al., 2011 ).    
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Cardiac muscle dysfunction of tafazzin (TAZ) knockdown (TAZKD) mice  
A pre -clinical mouse model of Barth Syndrome has been used to assess potential side effects 
and efficacy of elamipretide ( Soustek, M. S., et al. 2010 ). Upon induction of the TAZ -
specific shRNA in vivo  by [CONTACT_224702], TAZ mRNA levels in transgenic mice are reduced by 
>89% in cardiac and skeletal muscle. At week 8, elamipretide (5 mg/kg/day) or saline is 
administered via Alzet minipump for a period of 6 weeks. Cardiac echocardiograms are 
performed at wee ks 8 (prior to treatment), week 11 (3 weeks treatment) a nd week 14 (6 
weeks treatment) (Figure 2).

At week 14, the animals are sacrificed. The TAZKD mice had a 90% reduction in cardiolipin 
and approximately 10 -fold increase in MLCL. Treatment with elamipretide did not alter this 
distribution. Importantly, favorable findings regarding heart function, inc luding 
improvements in fractional shortening ( Figure 3 ), and histology (ventricle diameter and 
degree of fibrosis) were initially observed ( Figure 4 ). These changes were not significant 
across the full cohort due to variability resulting from sex and genot ype (hetero vs. 
homozygotes), and point to the difficulty in developi[INVESTIGATOR_224671].

elamipretide was explored using Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) parameters , 
patient reported outcomes (Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale [NMDAS] and a 
Daily Symptom Questionnaire [DSQ]), and plasma and urinary biomarkers.  
The highest dose of elamipretide examined in this trial, 0.25 mg/kg/hr, was associated with 
improvement in skeletal muscle function compared to placebo, as measured by [CONTACT_941] 6MWT

4.3.2.  Potential Risks  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Nonclinical Study Safety Findings  
The nonclinical testing of elamipretide encompasses a program of studies in pharmacology, 
metabolism, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology.   
Elamipretide was effective in multiple models of cardio -renal disease and skeletal muscle 
dysfunction and has been active across all species tested to date, including rat, guinea pig, 
rabbit, dog, sheep, and pig.  The effective dose range was 0.05 to 0.5 m g/kg/day.  Based on  
25 
results from a battery of secondary and safety pharmacology studies, elamipretide is not 
expected to cause any adverse off -target pharmacodynamic effects at therapeutic 
concentrations.    
Elamipretide did not cause end -organ toxicity at any dosage tested in either rats or dogs.  
Systemic toxicity at high doses was manifested primarily by [CONTACT_224704], which are mediated by [CONTACT_224705] -like reactions.  Effects were as sociated with 
maximum elamipretide plasma concentration (C max) and were rapi[INVESTIGATOR_224674] (and histamine) decreased.  Dose administration was not 
associated with any adverse effects on cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] o r central nervous system 
function; off -target non -adverse effects were limited to transient decrease of blood pressure 
and heart rate, consistent with histaminergic -like reactions.  In all studies, the severity of the 
effects was proportional to C max for elamipretide; thus, the safety margin is estimated based 
on C max, and not area under the plasma -concentration -time curve (AUC).  The plasma 
elamipretide threshold concentration for clinically -relevant adverse effects appears to be 
~20,000 ng/mL in both rats  and dogs, which is more than [ADDRESS_270076] cells at a concentrations ≥ 390 µg/mL. Elamipre tide was not 
associated with adverse effects on fertility or embryo -fetal development.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Human Safety  
Parenteral administration of elamipretide was assessed following single and multiple IV and 
SC doses in approximately 230 healthy subjects in 12 completed clinical pharmacology 
studies with data available. Single IV doses ranged from 0.005 mg/kg/hour to 0. 25 mg/kg/hr, 
and were typi[INVESTIGATOR_224675] 4 hours. Multiple -dose regimens ranged from 0.25 
mg/kg/hr administered over [ADDRESS_270078] been identified with administration of IV or SC elamipretide for up 
to seven days in these studies. The only systemic adverse event reported in over 5% of 
subjects was headache (8.8%).  Nausea (2.6%), hyponatraemia (2.6%), and dizzi ness (2.2%) 
were also reported. All other events were reported with incidence of <2.0%.  The majority of 
TEAEs were assessed by [CONTACT_224706], resolved without sequelae 
and did not require intervention.  There were no significant findings for group mean clinical 
laboratory, vital sign, electrocardiogram (ECG), or physical examination parameters within 
or across trials.  
The SC formulation of elamipretide has been studied in both single - and multiple -dose trials 
in healthy volunteers and patient populations. Generally, injection of SC elamipretide 
resulted in mild or moderate injection site reactions (ISRs), frequently cha racterized by 
[CONTACT_93489], induration, bruising, pruritus, pain, and/or urticaria. Injection site reactions were 
reported intermittently across dosing with elamipretide, with most subjects experiencing ISRs 
beginning upon first administration of elamipretide and continuing throughout treatment, 
with resolution of the ISRs typi[INVESTIGATOR_224676]. 
The resolution of ISRs, however, has occurred as late as [ADDRESS_270079].

Page 598 of 713  In subjects with renal impairment, exposure to elamipretide and both of its metabolites (M1 
and M2), as measured by [CONTACT_12265], increased proportionally to the degree of renal impairment. 
However, there was no evidence of increased toxicity as a consequence of im paired renal 
function. Similarly, in the drug -drug interaction studies carried out to date, co -administration 
of elamipretide with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], or with unfractionated heparin did not indicate 
a change in the nature, severity or frequency of A Es to the safety profile of either 
elamipretide or the comparator.  
Elamipretide, administered by [CONTACT_224707], was also assessed in completed studies in 
multiple patient populations including subjects with stable chronic heart failure, subjects with 
acute coronary syndrome who were undergoing primary percutaneous cor onary intervention 
and stenting for ST -elevation myocardial infarction, subjects with acute kidney injury 
undergoing percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty, subjects with PMM, subjects over 
60 years of age with evidence of skeletal muscle mitochondria l dysfunction, and in ongoing 
openlabel studies of in subjects with PMM and age -related macular degeneration. Single and 
multiple IV and SC doses of elamipretide were assessed with generally no notable 
differences between the elamipretide and placebo arms in the frequency or severity of 
adverse events, except for ISRs with SC elamipretide administration. Additionally, mild 
eosinophilia was reported as an adverse event in numerous subjects. Laboratory data 
demonstrated elevations (>0.45 cells x109/L) in eosi nophils beginning at approximately [ADDRESS_270080] after longer duration of 
treatment (16 weeks) and were demonstrated to have returned to within normal range or to 
baseline levels at the followup visit (up to 28 days after the end of elamipretide treatment). 
There wer e no other identified safety concerns in these trials with respect to other clinical 
laboratory results, physical examinations, vital signs, ECG data between the elamipretide and 
placebo. In general, the safety profile of systemic elamipretide was consiste nt with the pre -
existing, comorbid medical conditions.

concerns; hence the benefit:risk ratio of this trial is considered fav orable.

6.2. Discussion of Design and Control  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, two -period crossover trial in subjects 
with genetically confirmed Barth Syndrome, followed by [CONTACT_3440] -label treatment extension.  
Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to one of two sequence groups: 12 -weeks of treatment with 
SC elamipretide in Treatment Period 1 followed by 12 -weeks of treatment with placebo in 
Treatment Period 2 (separated by 4 -week washout period), or vice versa.   
A 4-week washout was selected to considerably reduce the likelihood of a carryover effect 
based on the known pharmacokinetics of elamipretide and anticipated turnover of 
mitochondria.  The crossover design was selected because of the additional anticipated  power

Page 605 of 713  due to subjects serving as their own control, given the anticipated scarcity of available 
subjects to participate in this study, due to the ultra -rare nature of this disease.  
Blinded treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation 
of endpoints.  
Part 2 is an open -label, uncontrolled treatment in which all subjects will receive elamipretide 
treatment for up to 192 weeks. This treatment period will allow for assessment of longer -term 
safety and tolerability in the target population, as well as allow  for detection of less -frequent

confirmed Barth Syndrome. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to one of two sequence 
groups: 12 -weeks of single daily subcutaneous (SC) doses of 40 mg elamipretide in 
Treatment Period 1 followed by 12 -weeks of treatment with placebo in Treatment Period 2 
(separated by 4 -week washout period), or vice versa. Subjects who will contin ue into Part [ADDRESS_270155] in the abdomen (rotating around the four abdominal quadrants) or thigh, provided that 
it is at least 5 cm from the previous day’s location of administration, by [CONTACT_5640] a trained 
caregiver or the subject. Admin istration of IMP will occur at approximately the same time 
every day (e.g. early morning, noon, early afternoon, or evening) during each Treatment 
Period.   
At the Treatment Period 1 Baseline and Treatment Period 2 Pre -dose Visits, IMP will be 
administered after completion of all specified procedures (Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 and Section

8.4. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Trial  
Multiple clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted to date, to assess the safety, 
tolerability and PK of elamipretide and its metabolites. Two similarly designed trials (SPI[INVESTIGATOR_224680] - 
101 and SPI[INVESTIGATOR_224680] -102) have been conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of single (2 -80 mg) and 7 -day repeat -dose administration (6 -80 mg) 
of ascending doses of elamipretide administered subcutaneously (SC) to healthy voluntee rs.  
In these studies, elamipretide was associated with no systemic safety issues.  Local injection 
site reactions were limited to transient, local erythema and occasional pruritus, pain, or 
swelling, which resolved spontaneously, generally within [ADDRESS_270157]-dose, without 
sequelae.   
The systemic exposure (in terms of mean AUC 0-τ on Day 7) to elamipretide following repeat 
SC injection at 40 mg in 1 mL was 3,810 ng∙h/mL, while mean C max on Day 7 was 1,320 
ng/mL.  No accumulation of elamipretide was seen following repeat dosing for seven 
consecutive days. Neither metabolite of elamipretide (M1 and M2) is active or implicated in 
toxicology.  
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_224673] -201 trial provides supporting information regarding safety and plasma exposure

systemic toxicity and local tolerability of elamipretide administered as S C injections, once

The data displayed demonstrate that exposure to elamipretide, M1 and M2 in the chronic 
toxicology studies are supportive of chronic dosing at 40 mg/day by [CONTACT_10530], in human, 
assuming an average body weight of approximately [ADDRESS_270159] ion (GFR > 
90 mL/min).  
The PK of elamipretide is body weight dependent.  In a clinical pharmacology study 
assessing the safety and PK of elamipretide administered as SC injection, once daily for 7 
days (SPI[INVESTIGATOR_224680]102), body weight plotted against C max and AUC 0-last of elamipretide and its’ 
metabolites demonstrated negative correlation; as body weight increases, C max and AUC 0-last 
will decrease in an approximately linear manner.  These data indicate that an individual with 
a body weight of [ADDRESS_270160] 25% greater expo sure to elamipretide and 
M1 and 45% greater exposure to M2 than an individual with a body weight of 75 kg at the 
same dose level of study drug.  Safety margins displayed in Table 3 demonstrate that an 
individual with a body weight of 30 kg administered 40 mg elamipretide SC would be 
expected to remain within acceptable ranges of exposure to elamipretide, M1 and M2 and are 
therefore included in the study population.  Patients with bod y weight < 30 kg are excluded 
from participation.  
Elamipretide and its’ metabolites are excreted by [CONTACT_10521], therefore decreased renal 
function impacts the PK of the compounds.  A clinical pharmacology trial in subjects with 
normal renal function or mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (SPI[CONTACT_50637] -101) 
demonstrates a negative correlation between GFR and exposure to elamipretide, M1 and M2; 
as GFR decreases C max and AUC 0-last will increase in an approximately linear manner.  
Exposure to elamipretide is expected to be approximately 2.[ADDRESS_270161] with 
GFR < 30 mL/min compared to the corresponding exposure in a subject with normal renal 
function while M1 and M2 increase approximately 3.9 -fold and 8.4 -fold respectively in the 
same comparison.  Safety margins displayed in Table 3 demonstrate tha t in order to maintain 
adequate toxicity exposure for dose levels in human, a dose level of 40 mg elamipretide SC 
would be expected to remain within acceptable ranges of exposure to elamipretide, M1 and 
M2 in subjects with GFR >60 mL/min,  
60 
assuming average body weight (75 kg).  Subjects with GFR < 60 mL/min are excluded from 
participation.  
Taken together, body weight and renal function effects on exposure of elamipretide and its’ 
metabolites allow the following inclusion criteria in this study:  
a. Patient body weight > 30 kg with GFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 OR

In case of an immediate medical emergency or if directed by [CONTACT_1034], and only if the 
information is required by [CONTACT_224716] a subject’s AE, is a subject’s treatment 
assignment to be unblinded prematurely. In cases of medical emergency, t he Investigator may 
unblind a subject’s treatment assignment using the computerized system according to the 
instructions received. The Sponsor must be notified as soon as possible regarding the reason 
for unblinding.  
Whenever the treatment assignment of an individual subject is unblinded, the individual who 
performed the unblinding, the date, time and reason for the unblinding must be logged in the 
computerized unblinding system (IWRS) and also included in source docum entation. The

Assessment of PK via a population model (see  Section 11.2.6 )  
9.2. Safety Endpoints  
The safety and tolerability endpoints will be assessed by: 
x AEs  
x Vital signs  
x ECGs  
x Ambulatory arrhythmias x 
Clinical laboratory evaluations  
x Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The safety profile of elamipretide will be assessed through the recording, reporting, and 
analyzing of adverse events, clinical evaluations, and laboratory tests.   
Comprehensive assessment of adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_224717]’s signature [CONTACT_43998], throughout the course of the 
trial, and until the conclusion of the clinical trial’s post treatment follow -up period.   
Subjects must be seen by a physician or designee (an appropriately trained healthcare 
professional) at every trial visit and the evaluation must be documented. Trial center 
personnel will report any adverse event (AE), whether observed by [CONTACT_737] (or 
designee), or reported by [CONTACT_423].

described in Section 9.10.[ADDRESS_270166] a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medi cinal product.  
9.4. Pre-Treatment Events  
Untoward events and/or incidental diagnoses that occur prior to IMP administration are by 
[CONTACT_108], unrelated to the IMP and will be reported as such in the data listings. Pre -treatment 
events or incidental diagnoses will be recorded on the past medical history electronic case 
report form (eCRF).  However, if a pre -treatment event is assessed by [CONTACT_224718] a trial procedure and/or meets seriousness criteria, it will be recorded as an AE on 
the AE eCRF, processed, and followed according ly.  
9.5. Baseline Medical Conditions  
Baseline medical conditions, related or not related to the therapeutic area of  
interest/investigation, that worsen in severity or frequency during the trial in a way that is not 
consistent with natural disease progression, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], should be 
recorded and reported as AEs.  
9.6. Medical and Surgical Procedures  
Medical or surgical procedures (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) scheduled prior to signing the 
informed consent, but occurring during the trial should not be captured as AEs. The condition 
leading to the procedure should be listed in the medical history and th e procedure should be 
captured on the concurrent procedures page. Medical or surgical procedures not scheduled 
prior to signing the informed consent should not be recorded as adverse events; the condition 
that led to the need to perform the medical or surg ical procedure will be the AE or SAE and 
the procedure should be captured on the concurrent procedures page.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131 for SC Injection)  
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_49840] -[ADDRESS_270167] be reported immediately to the trial Medic al Monitor.  
9.9. Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
A SAE is any AE that: 
x Results in death.  
x Is life -threatening. The term “life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the subject 
is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.  
x Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_224682]. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allerg ic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131 for SC Injection)  
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_49840] -[ADDRESS_270168] be recorded on 
the appropriate screen(s) of the subject’s eCRF.  
9.10.  Recording of Adverse Events  
Complete and accurate data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the reporting period  
(defined below) will be recorded on an ongoing basis on the Adverse Event Case Report 
Form (CRF).   All SAEs must be reported using the trial specific SAE Report Form, in 
addition to the Adverse Event CRF.  
It is important that each AE entry include a verbatim term along with, onset and resolution 
dates, severity, seriousness, relationship to the IMP, action taken with respect to the IMP, and 
its outcome.  
Investigators should use the adverse event definitions provided in the above sections and 
should observe the following guidelines when completing the AE pages of the CRF:  
65 
x Whenever possible, recognized medical terms should be used to describe AEs rather 
than colloquialisms (for example, ‘influenza’ rather than ‘flu’), and abbreviations 
should be avoided.  
x Adverse events should be described using a specific clinical diagnosis, if this is 
available, rather than a list of signs or symptoms (for example, ‘congestive heart 
failure’ rather than ‘dyspnea, rales and cyanosis’). However, signs/symptoms that are 
not associated with an identified disease or syndrome, or for which an overall 
diagnosis is not yet available, should be reported as individual AEs.   
x Provisional diagnosis (e.g. “suspected Myocardial Infarction”) is acceptable but should 
be followed up to a definite diagnosis if finally, available. Similarly, a fatal event with 
an unknown cause should be recorded as “Unknown”  
x In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a 
procedure is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.

Page 641 of 713  9.10.1.  Investigator Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Severity  
Severity , which is a description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from the 
regulatory definition of seriousness . The Investigator is required to grade the severity of each 
adverse event according to the following guidelines.  
Investigators must assess the severity/intensity of adverse events according to the following 
qualitative toxicity scale:  
Mild:  Associated with no limitation of usual activities or only slight discomfort; 
generally not requiring alteration or cessation of IMP administration; and/or 
not needing therapeutic intervention.  
Moderate:  Associated with limitation of usual activities or significant discomfort; 
generally requiring alteration or cessation of IMP administration; and/or 
requiring therapeutic intervention.  
Severe:  Associated with inability of subject to carry out usual activities or very marked 
discomfort; considered to be life -threatening; resulting in significant disability 
or incapacity; and requiring therapeutic intervention.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Relationship to the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP)  
Investigators must systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to the IMP(s) 
according to the following guidelines:  
Probable:  A causal relationship is clinically/biologically highly plausible, there is 
a plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration 
of the IMP, the event is unlikely to be attributed to 
underlying/concurrent disease, other drugs, or other fact ors, and there 
is a reasonable response on withdrawal.  
66 
Possible:  A causal relationship is clinically/biologically plausible and there is a 
plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of 
the IMP.  
Unlikely:  A causal relationship is improbable and/or another documented cause of 
the AE is most plausible.  
Unrelated:  A causal relationship is clinically/biologically improbable, there is not a 
plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of 
the IMP, the event is likely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent 
disease, other drugs, or other factors,  and there is no reasonable 
response on withdrawal.

Stealth BioTherapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 642 of 713  [IP_ADDRESS].  Outcome of an Adverse Event  
Investigators must follow all AEs and SAEs as described in Section 9.10.2 . Outcome is 
defined as:  
x Recovered/Resolved;    x 
Recovering/Resolving x Not 
recovered/Not resolved x 
Recovered/Resolved with sequelae; x 
Fatal; or x Unknown.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting of Injection Site Reactions (ISR)  
Local ISRs have been frequently experienced with SC elamipretide administration. 
Characteristics of these injection site reactions were mild erythema, mild swelling, and mild 
pruritus, commencing within the first hour of the injection and generally resolvi ng within 4 
hours.   
In order to standardize the reporting of ISRs, the following guidance should be 
followed: x Any ISR following SC administration should be reported as an AE.   
o The ISR should be assessed for severity using the “Table for Grading the 
Severity of Site Reactions to Injections” provided in Attachment 16 . 
o Any ISR that meets any of the criteria of an SAE ( Section 9.9 ) should be 
reported within [ADDRESS_270169] becoming aware of the event 
(as outlined in Section 9.11 ). 
o The ISR should be reported as the characteristic of the ISR, rather than the 
general term of “Injection Site Reaction”. For instance, erythema associated 
with an ISR should be reported as “injection site erythema” or “redness at 
injection site” rather than  the broad term “injection site reaction”.

SPI[INVESTIGATOR_49840] -[ADDRESS_270171] signs the informed consent and 
continues through the clinical trial’s post treatment follow -up period.  
After trial completion, all SAEs with an ongoing/unknown outcome will be followed -up until 
resolution or stabilization.  Additional information on SAEs, obtained after database lock, 
will reside solely in the safety database.   
9.11.  Serious Adverse Event Expedited Reporting  
In the event of a SAE occurring during the reporting period, the Investigator must 
immediately (within 24 HOURS after becoming aware of the SAE) inform the Sponsor by 
[CONTACT_756], by [CONTACT_152478] e -mail as detailed in the SAE form, completion instructions, CRF 
completion guidelines, and/or Safety Management Plan.   
For any SAE, the following minimum information is required as initial 
notification: x Investigator/Reporter with full contact [CONTACT_3031]  
x Subject identification details (trial number, center number, subject number), x 
IMP administration details (dose and dates)  
x Event Verbatim, a brief description of signs/symptoms/or diagnosis and the date of 
onset,   
x Seriousness criteria (ion) met, and,  
x Relationship of the event to the IMP (e.g., the causality according to the Investigator) 
All SAE reports should be transmitted according to the Safety Management Plan.    
The Investigator/Reporter must provide follow -up information as available or requested by 
[CONTACT_1034].   
9.11.1.  Pregnancy and Contraception  
For male subjects with female partners of child -bearing potential, highly effective methods of 
contraception must be adhered to prior to entry into the study and for at least [ADDRESS_270172] dose of study drug. Highly effective methods of contraception  is defined as the usage by 
[CONTACT_224719] -uterine device (which 
should be established prior to the start of the study) plus usage by [CONTACT_224720] -containing barrier meth od of contraception. Male subjects with 
pregnant partners must use a condom with spermicide from the start of treatment until at least 
2 months after the  
Elamipretide (MTP -131 for SC Injection)  
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_49840] -[ADDRESS_270173] be reported within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy even if 
no AE has occurred, as detailed in the Safety Management Plan. If th e investigator suspects 
the pregnancy has resulted from an interaction of the trial medication with contraceptives, 
then the pregnancy is considered as an AE; however, all pregnancies must be recorded in the 
AE page/section of the CRF.   
Investigators must actively follow up, document, and report on the outcome of every 
pregnancy, even if the subject is withdrawn from the trial, as detailed in the Safety 
Management Plan.  
9.11.2.  Responsibilities to Regulatory Authorities, Investigators and Ethics 
Committees  
The Sponsor will send appropriate safety notifications to regulatory authorities in accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations.  
The Investigator must comply with any applicable center -specific requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs involving his/her subjects to the Ethics Committee/Institutional Review 
Board (EC/IRB) that approved the trial.  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of findings 
that could adversely affect the safety of subjects, impact the conduct of the trial, or alter the 
EC’s/IRB’s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_150831]. In pa rticular, and in line with 
respective regulations, the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of adverse events that are 
both serious and unexpected and are considered to be related to the administered IMP 
(“suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions” or  S[LOCATION_003]Rs). The Investigator should 
place copi[INVESTIGATOR_224683]. National regulations with 
regard to Safety report notifications to Investigators will be taken into account.  
When specifically required by [CONTACT_43973], the Sponsor will provide 
appropriate Safety reports directly to the concerned lead IEC/central IRB and will maintain 
records of these notifications. When direct reporting by [CONTACT_224721], the Investigator will be responsible for promptly 
notifying the concerned IEC/IRB of any Safety reports provided by [CONTACT_224722][INVESTIGATOR_224684] e File.  
For trials covered by [CONTACT_43975] 2001/20/EC, the Sponsor’s responsibilities 
regarding the reporting of SAEs/S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be carried out in accordance with that 
Directive and with the related detailed Guidances.

 10. DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, the Sponsor or its representatives will do the 
following:  
x Provide instructional material to the trial centers, as appropriate  
x Sponsor start -up training to instruct the Investigators and trial coordinators.  This 
training will give instruction on the protocol, the completion of the eCRFs, and trial 
procedures.  
x Make periodic visits to the trial center  
x Be available for consultation and stay in contact [CONTACT_224723], 
telephone, and/or fax  
x Review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard computer edits to detect errors in data 
collection  
x Conduct a quality review of the database  
In addition, the Sponsor or its representatives will periodically check a sample of the subject 
data recorded against source documents at the trial center. The trial may be audited by [CONTACT_224724], and/or regulatory agencies at any ti me.  Investigators will be 
given notice before an audit occurs.  
To ensure the safety of participants in the trial, and to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable 
data, the Investigator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and subject medical 
records in the subject files as original source documents fo r the trial.  If requested, the 
Investigator will provide the Sponsor, applicable regulatory agencies, and applicable ECs 
with direct access to original source documents.  
10.1.  Data Capture System  
An electronic data capture system (eDC) will be used in this trial. The trial center will 
maintain a separate source for the data entered by [CONTACT_224725] -provided 
electronic data capture system.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131 for SC Injection)  
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_49840] -[ADDRESS_270174], will be stored electronica lly in the central vendor’s 
database system.  
Any data for which paper documentation provided by [CONTACT_224726] a source 
document will be identified and documented by [CONTACT_224727]’s trial file. 
Paper documentation provided by [CONTACT_224728], for example, a paper  diary to 
collect subject reported outcome measures (e.g., a rating scale), a daily dosing schedule, or an 
event diary.   
[ADDRESS_270175] deviation of paired differences of 50 meters for 
the 6MWT distance and 1.3 points for the BTHS -SA Total Fatigue score, 12 subjects 
provides for nearly 80% power to detect a mean improvement of 50 meters in the 6MWT or 
1.3 points for the BTHS -SA Total Fatigue score, with each potentially tested at the 0.025 
(two-sided) level of significance (associated with a potential adjustment via Hochberg’s 
procedure). Subject numbers are restricted by [CONTACT_224696] (availability of 
subjects) but that recruitment could be greater if subjec ts are available (up to 16 subjects).  
11.2.  Statistical and Analytical Plans  
11.2.1.  General Considerations  
All trial data are to be displayed in the data listings.  
Statistical analysis of this trial will be the responsibility of the Sponsor or its designee.    
Additional details regarding analyses will be included in separate statistical analysis plan 
(SAP).  
Elamipretide (MTP -131 for SC Injection)  
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_49840] -[ADDRESS_270176]’s age, sex, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and other demographic 
characteristics will be recorded and summarized.  
Medical history will be listed.  
11.2.4.  Endpoints and Methodology  
[IP_ADDRESS].  General Considerations  
Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minima, and maxima) for continuous variables and using frequencies and 
percentages for discrete variables. Data will be presented by [CONTACT_224729], 
where treatment is defined for subjects within a specific period.  Formal statistical tests 
(where performed) will be 2 -sided at the alpha=0.[ADDRESS_270177] for multiplicity for the primary endpoint family.  
71 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis Populations  
Approximately 12 subjects will be randomized and will receive either IMP (elamipretide or 
placebo) in the first treatment period, followed by [CONTACT_224730], according to the randomly assigned treatment sequence.   
Statistical analysis will be performed in the following populations:  
Safety Population – Includes all trial subjects who receive at least 1 dose of IMP according to 
treatment received within a period.  
Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Population – Includes all trial subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
IMP, according to the treatment sequence group to which they were randomized.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population – Includes all ITT subjects without major protocol 
violations/deviations. The list of major protocol violations/deviations will be identified and 
specified prior to final database lock for the trial that would lead to exclusion  for the PP 
analysis.

Stealth BioTherapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 648 of 713  Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population – Includes all trial subjects who have at least 1 PK sample 
taken during their participation.  
The details of all analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan to be finalized 
before unblinding.    
11.2.5.  Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT population. All tests of treatment effects will 
be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05.  
The distance walked (meters) during the 6MWT and Total Fatigue score on the BTHS -SA 
constitute the family of primary endpoints. A family -wise alpha level of 0.05 will be 
maintained for the primary endpoint family, using Hochberg’s procedure. If both primar y 
endpoints are significantly different from placebo at the 0.05 (two -sided) level of significance 
(in favor of treatment), then both will be considered statistically significant. Otherwise the 
endpoint with the smaller p -value of the two will be considere d statistically significant, if 
statistically significant at the 0.025 (two -sided) level of significance.  
Analyses of continuous endpoints at the end of each treatment period will be conducted 
utilizing a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach. Subject will be considered as 
a random effect.  Additional details regarding the model and underlying assumpti ons will be 
specified in the SAP.  
Secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be assessed in a similar manner as the 
primary efficacy endpoints.   
No adjustments for multiplicity will be provided for secondary or exploratory endpoints.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Handling of Missing Data  
A significant amount of missing data are not anticipated, given characteristics of the subject 
population from which subjects will be enrolled. In addition, the mixed model repeated 
measures approach is valid under a missing at random (MAR) missingness mec hanism.  
72 
Nevertheless, depending on the extent of missing data, additional sensitivity analyses may be 
considered.  
11.2.6.  Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis  
Elamipretide and metabolite plasma concentration data will be collected in all subjects and 
will be used in a non -linear mixed effects model to assess the characteristics of elamipretide 
and metabolite PK in the PK population.

Page 649 of 713  The PK model will be generated and validated using data reported from historical, thorough 
PK studies. Where sufficient data allows, covariates will include age, race, renal function (as 
described by [CONTACT_67889]), intercurrent conditions and concomitant medicatio ns.  
Plasma samples will be analyzed for elamipretide and metabolites using a validated liquid 
chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry assay.   
Additional details and all model assumptions, validation and data analysis will be detailed in 
the PK Analysis Plan prior to database lock.  
11.2.7.  Safety Analyses  
Safety data analysis will be conducted on all subjects in the Safety Population with treatment 
group determined by [CONTACT_224731] a particular period (i.e., subjects dosing in both 
periods will be counted in both treatment groups).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events  
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing 1 or more AEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570], relationship to IMP, and severity. AEs will be coded using Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.  AEs will be summarized by  
[CONTACT_9313] (SOC), preferred term (PT), and treatment group.  
All reported AEs will be listed, but only treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be 
summarized.  
The incidence of all TEAEs, drug relationship with TEAEs, and severity of TEAE will be 
summarized. In the summary tables, subjects may be counted under multiple SOCs and PTs, 
but for each SOC and PT, subjects are only counted once (within a treatment group ). If a 
subject has the same AE on multiple occasions (with a treatment period), the highest severity 
(severe > moderate > mild) or drug relationship (probable > possibly related > unlikely 
related > unrelated) recorded for the event will be presented. If severity is missing, subjects 
will be included as missing (for severity). If drug relationship is missing, subjects will be 
included in related tables (e.g., considered related).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Deaths and Other Serious Adverse 
Events Listings will be provided for the following: x 
Deaths x SAEs  
x AEs leading to discontinuation of IMP

are relative to the Pre -dose Visit of the respective Treatment Period.  
b. Height will only be measured during all physical examinations, and used in the trial to calculate BMI.  Physical examination will 
include: general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck (including thyroid), lymph nodes, chest, heart, abdom en, 
extremities, and nervous system, and weight.  
c. Vital signs will include HR, RR, and BP after sitting for [ADDRESS_270192] 10 min in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
e. See Attachment 4 for laboratory tests. Additional blood samples, at the Part 2 Early Discontinuation Visit (if applicable), will be 
collected and stored for assessing the immunogenicity potential of the IMP.  
f. For subjects ≥ 18 years of age at the Screening Visit, the PROMIS Adult Short Form Fatigue should be completed. Subjects 12 -17 
years of age at the Screening Visit, the PROMIS Pediatric Short Form Fatigue should be completed for the duration of the tria l. 
g. The age appropriate BTHS -SA should be completed only at clinical site visits. For subjects ≥ 16 years of age at the Screening Visit, 
the BTHS -SA Adult should be completed. Subjects 12 -15 years of age at the Screening Visit, the BTHS -SA Adolescent should be  
completed for the duration of the trial.  
h. For subjects ≥ 16 years of age at the Screening Visit, the PGI Adult should be completed. Subjects 12 -15 years of age at the 
Screening Visit, the PGI Adolescent should be completed for the duration of the trial.

particular subject.  
l. PK Schedule: Pre -dose ( -30 min); 0.5h (± 5 min); 1h (± 10 min); 2h (± 15 min); 4h (± 15 min). All PK sampling should be 
conducted at the defined time points at a single clinical site visit. The clinical site visit at which the PK sampling should  occur 
shou ld be the earliest clinical site visit possible in Part 2 (at or after the Week 12 Visit in Part 2). On the day of the Visit that the PK 
samples are collected, subjects should be instructed to administer the IMP at the trial center. To reduce trial procedu re burden, PK 
sampling may be completed during a scheduled clinical site visits in Part 2 or on an independent clinical site visit.  
Additionally, to reduce the need for multiple venipunctures, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], a venous catheter may be use d for PK 
sample collection.  
m. Daily IMP injections should begin the day after the Part 1 Treatment Period 2 Week 12 Visit. On the day of the Visit that the  PK 
samples are collected, subjects should be instructed to administer the IMP at the trial center. Injections should be in the a bdomen 
(rotating around the four abdominal quadrants) or thigh, provided that it is at least 5 cm from the previous day’s location o f 
administration at approximately the same time each day (e.g. early morning, noon, early afternoon, or evening).  
n. The Part 2 Treatment Period will end with the Part 2 EOT Visit.  This will occur after completion of the Week 192 Visit, or a nytime 
between the Week 144 – [ADDRESS_270196] complete all scheduled assessments for the EOT visit prior to enrolling in the subsequent SBT program.

Page 677 of 713  Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. 
Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There 
does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no 
injury results, this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., guns hot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story).  
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?

Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow preven ted from pulling trigger. Once they pull the 
trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from l edge. Hanging: Person has noose

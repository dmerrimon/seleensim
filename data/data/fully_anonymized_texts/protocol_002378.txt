Official Title: Promoting Emotional Well- Being in Distressed NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) 
Mothers: A Phase 2 Evaluation of a Nurse -Delivered Approach  
Study ID: [REMOVED] 
Document Date: 06/22/[ADDRESS_357139] Title : Mothers Emotional Experiences in the NICU -2 
Background: NICU mothers face numerous stressors, including fears about their infant’s survival, 
alteration of parental role, the challenges of caring for a critically ill child, and social isolation. In fact, 
63% of NICU mothers report significant emotional distress in the form of elevated depression symptoms 
early in their newborn’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], with 30% still reporting distress [ADDRESS_357140] depression symptoms rather than a major depression disorder, the associated psychosocial 
impairment is known to be equivalent in the general population,6 -9 and in postpartum women. An 
analysis of the types of depression symptoms reported early in the postpartum period revealed that 
approximately 33% of NICU mothers experience suicidal thoughts, compared to the 14% of perinatal 
women in the general population. Not surprisingly, NICU mothers also report significantly more anxiety 
symptoms than mothers of term infants,13,14 with up to 3 2% meeting the criteria for Acute Stress 
Disorder in the first [ADDRESS_357141]: even two years later, distressed mothers of premature 
infants remain less receptive to their toddler's cues and less engaged with their play. A recent state- of-
the-art report suggests that the diminished parenting associated with emotional distress may interfere 
with a family’s readiness for discharge, which is determined by [CONTACT_292844]’s clinical condition but also by [CONTACT_292845]. In summary, many NICU mothers are emotionally 
distressed, particu larly early in their newborn’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. In the short term, this distress may lead 
to increased infant length of stay and later lead to deleterious effects on the social and emotional 
development of the child.  
Nurse Parent Support : The principles of  family -centered care, widely adopted by [CONTACT_292846], call for an 
expanded focus on the well -being of the entire family,yet the emotional well -being of at -risk NICU 
mothers is often not directly addressed. For example, while one educational intervention designed  to 
enhance parental copi[INVESTIGATOR_292830], the focus of this intervention is on parenting the newborn not the emotional needs of the mother. At best, emotional care of NICU mothers is often limited to screening and referral of 
mothers with significant depression symptoms to a mental health professional. Several common barriers 
prevent most perinatal women from taking the next step and receiving treatment. Moreover, because 
many NICU mothers often prioritize visiting their newborn and taking care of other family members, 
they may not feel that they have time to seek treatment from a mental health professional. A critical need for emotionally distressed NICU mothers is accessible suppor t from an on -site healthcare 
professional who understands the medical issues of the newborn, in short, a NICU nurse.  
The provision of nurse support is central to the Nurse Parent Support Model. While many theoretical conceptualizations of social support fo cuses on help provided by [CONTACT_292847] a person’s 
family or friend support network, the Nurse Parent Support Model uniquely recognizes the role of nurses in providing four overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_292831]: 1 ) 
supportive communication and information giving (information about the newborn’s physical status) 2) emotional support (concerns and listening), 3) esteem (giving affirmation and feedback), and 4) 
instrumental support (tangible assistance, especially in terms of care provided to newborn). The 
significant impact of supportive nursing care on maternal mental health outcomes was the focus of one 
study of 62 mothers of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292832]. In this sample, 40.3% of mothers had elevated 
depression symp toms scores. Results of the logistic regression analysis indicated that significant 
predictors of maternal depression included maternal stress (an increase of one point in stress level score 
increased risk of depression by 14%), and perception of nurse sup port (as scores on the perception of 
nursing support scale decreased by a point, the risk of depression increased by 6%). Moreover, 
supportive care, in the form of providing empathic listening from nurses, has also been identified as a 
key predictor of parental satisfaction in neonatal settings.[ADDRESS_357142] 
that they are ideally positioned to implement systems of support for NICU mothers. Additionally, compared to mental- health professionals, NICU nurses are medically knowledgeable about hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292833]’s physical status and are thu s better able to understand the mothers medical concerns related 
to her infant.  
Listening Visits (LV):  A nurse -delivered mother -centered approach. The LV intervention was developed 
by a British psychiatrist/ nurse team to be provided by [CONTACT_233553] -visiting nurse s to depressed mothers of 
term infants. Based on Rogerian nondirective counseling methods, the central assumption of this 
approach is that talking about feelings to an empathic and nonjudgmental professional will help people 
to take a more positive view of  themselves and their lives. Empathic listening, which is central to LV, is 
rarely thought of as a first -line intervention, instead it is viewed as a therapeutic skill to enhance 
delivery of specific treatments. Yet a recent meta -analytic review found that  nondirective, empathic 
listening interventions achieved large effects sizes when compared to no treatment control, and also 
found a small differential in the effect size achieved by [CONTACT_292848].[ADDRESS_357143] evaluation of LV were 
positive. Prompted by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_292834],the British National Institute for 
Clinical Excellence recommended LV as an evidence -based treatment for mild/moderate levels of 
depression symptoms in postpartum women of term infants.  
From [ADDRESS_357144] time in the NICU.41 Here LV, were 
delivered in six, 30 -50 minute sessions that were provided in a private hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292835], every 
two to three days by a DNP nurse who had completed LV training. Results of this open trial were promising: 25.5% of [ADDRESS_357145] such nurses and this level of nurse is expensive. Lastly, in order  
to justify the staff time required to implement LV, improvement in outcomes of central importance to nursing and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98166] (e.g. perception of nurse support and infant length -of-stay) have not 
yet been demonstrated. To address these limitati ons of our prior work, we have proposed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], 
evaluating LV delivered by [CONTACT_68929]’s level NICU nurses as compared to the usual mental health care 
provided by [CONTACT_292849]. Our primary outcomes are depression symptoms (in line with the 
open t rial) and two new outcomes: perception of nurse support and infant length -of-stay. A recent 
study has shown that the presence of maternal mental -health disorders is linked to decreased maternal 
readiness for infant discharge, which may in turn influence ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_292836]. 
Secondary outcomes include worry, stress, anxiety symptoms, and parent satisfaction with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422].  
During the RCT, we learned that it was difficult for the Listening Visits nurse to deliver all six session 
prior t o infant discharge due to the hectic schedule of mothers. With the pandemic it is no longer 
possible for the nurses to meet with the mothers face to face due to the possible increased risk to all. 
With approval from NINR program officer, we are assessing t he feasibility of telehealth LV in an open 
trial.  
The admission of a newborn to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is an extremely stressful postpartum outcome, as evidenced by [CONTACT_292850] 63% of 
new NICU mothe rs. As part of a Family -Centered Care philosophy, focus on the emotional well- being of 
the mother (and indeed the entire family) should be widely adopted by [CONTACT_292851]. In current 
clinical practice, however, the emotional well- being of NICU mothers  is often ignored. At best, NICU 
mothers are screened for depression and if indicated, referred to a mental health professional. We posit 
that the extremes of no treatment and full -on mental healthcare comprise an inadequate approach for 
treating mothers d ealing with a normative reaction to a stressful event. In alignment with the Nurse 
Parent Support Model, we propose implementation of Listening Visits —a cost -effective nurse- delivered 
supportive approach, proven to relieve moderately severe depressive symp toms in mothers of 
newborns born at full term who were not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. In the NICU setting, Listening Visits were first implemented in a phase -[ADDRESS_357146] evaluated Listening Visits provided by [CONTACT_68929]’s -level NICU nurses as compared 
with the care currently provided by [CONTACT_292852]. In three specific aims we will assess the 
relative effectiveness of Listening Visits on depression symptoms, perception of nurse support, and 
infant’s length -of-stay. In March the study was stopped due to the pandemic. The data and safety 
monitoring committee advised us to complete the analyses of the [ADDRESS_357147] was 
approved by [CONTACT_1758]'s program officer at the National Institute of Nursing Research. Because 
recruitment at UIHC is slow, the modification (June 2021) proposed to recruit NICU mothers via the 
OVIA Health Paren ting app.  
[CONTACT_292857] will review selected audio recordings of the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_292837]. She is at the Swansea University in Wales and will access a secure university 
server to listen to these recordings.  
Specific Arms:  
Specific Aim #1:  Compare the effects of LV with usual care (UC) on depressive symptoms as 
assessed by [CONTACT_292853] & Anxiety Symptoms -General Depression Scale (IDAS -
GD). Secondarily, the study will compare LV with UC on worry , stress, anxiety, and parent 
satisfaction with NICU care.  
Hypothesis: LV recipi[INVESTIGATOR_292838] -GD total scores than those 
randomized to UC at 4 & [ADDRESS_357148] enrollment.

22-21 is focused o n a new cohort of women: those who use the parenting app. In this cohort, the 
research is focused only on the mother. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292840].)  
Modification request November 2021: This modificati on proposes to continue recruitment with OVIA 
Health and to also recruit from UI mass email, and via a flier at the UIHC NICU or (Modification Feb 
2022) the NICU in Unity Point Health St. Luke's Cedar Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292841] 2022: Have fliers  available in the Ronald McDonald House UIHC in 
appropriate places: front desk, provided to mothers of NICU newborns, in the public areas.  
Modification Request April 2022: Place an ad on the website of NICU Families of Eastern Iowa (the ad 
has the same des cription as the mass email)  
Modification Request May 2022: Mothers of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292842]'s 
Wellness Center who are interested in learning more about the study will receive an email describing 
the study and containing the Redcap link to find out more about the study, and if interested enroll (see 
attachment "DESCRI~1.DOC).  
Modification request May 2022: Users of the NICU Parent Support blog/FB page will see an ad on the 
blog/page: see attachment labeled  "NICU Parent Support  Blog ad". Those who are interested in learning 
more about the study will click a link that will take them to the Redcap survey  
As with the Ovia Health Parenting app, in this cohort the research is focused only on the mother. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292843].  
1. Immediately after enrolling into the open trial, participants will complete questions pertaining to her contact [CONTACT_3031] (email, phone number and postal address) as well as the baseline 
assessment  questionnaires. The REDCap  survey will be programmed to send an email to a 
member of the research team when a new participant has enrolled. A member of the research 
team will give the woman’s email and phone number to the Listening Visits nurse, who will 
contact [CONTACT_292855]. A member of the 
research team will use the address to provide compensation for the completion of the baseline 
assessment.  
2. Listening Visits will be provided by a NICU nurse research  team member virtually. Women who 
enroll into the open trial will be invited to meet virtually with a NICU nurse up to [ADDRESS_357151] with women via zoom, they will check with her 
if it is still a good time for her to talk and that she feels she has sufficient privacy. If no, then a 
different time will be arranged. The nurse will send the woman a zoom link for each session. With consultation from IT on how to set up the zoom session s o that it is compliant and secure, 
the NICU Listening Visit nurses will send the link to the participant via email. Participants will 
meet for up to six sessions with the NICU nurse for the Listening Visits. This intervention is 
nondirective; thus, the spe cific focus of each session is directed by [CONTACT_292856]. 
Each session provides a time for the woman to discuss her concerns with a nonjudgmental  
listening who utilizes reflective listening and problem solving to provide an empathic 
intercha nge. Early sessions are oriented toward listening while in later sessions the nurse and 
woman work collaboratively to identify specific problems and generate solutions. The last 
session involves a summary of the sessions.

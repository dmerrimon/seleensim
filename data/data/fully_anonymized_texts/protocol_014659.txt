2(131)PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS
A Phase II Open-Label, Multi-Center Study of MEDI4736 Evaluated as 
Single Agent or in Combination with Tremelimumab in Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
International Coordinating Investigators
 
Number of patients planned
This study will consist of Part A, Lead-in, as well as a possible Part B, non-randomized 
expansion (Part B: Expansion) or a possible Part B, randomized controlled study
(Part B: RCT).  This study will initially enroll approximately 60 patients to receive 
MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy (Part A:Lead-in). Depending on the data in each arm from Part A, a non-randomized expansion phase 
may be initiated (Part B: Expansion approximately 140 additional patients, 70 patients per 
arm) and/or a randomized, controlled study (Part B: Randomized, controlled trial ([RCT]) may be initiated to compare MEDI4736 monotherapy and/or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
combination to Standard of Care (SoC; approximately 375 total additional patients, 125 
patients per arm).

Study design
This is a Phase II, open-label, multi-center study to determine the efficacy and safety of 
MEDI4736 evaluated as single agent or in combination with tremelimumab in patients with 
metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) whose disease has progressed on5-FU-containing or gemcitabine-containing first-line chemotherapy.  Initially, patients will be 
enrolled and randomized (1:1) to treatment with MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab, until [ADDRESS_666315] been randomized to treatment in each arm (Part A: Lead-in).  Patient recruitment and tumor assessment will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
The format of Part B will be determined based on the responses seen in the first 30 patients in 
each arm in Part A.  A protocol amendment will be made if criteria are met to proceed to 33'

3(131)Part B. The protocol amendment will include available data from Part A and any changes to 
study design and statistical plan, if needed.
! Part B: Expansion .  If an ORR of >25% (ie, responses in ≥8 patients) is observed 
in the first 30 treated patients in either treatment arm in Part A (unless the totality of 
the data supports a different decision), after protocol amendment an additional 70 patients will be enrolled in that arm, for a total of 100 evaluable patients per arm.
! Part B: Randomized, controlled trial (RCT) .  If an ORR of >15% and <25% 
(ie, response in ≥5 patients and <8 patients) is observed in the first 30 treated 
patients in either treatment arm in Part A, a randomized, controlled substudy maybe initiated after protocol amendment.
If Part B: RCT is initiated, this will be a randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, 
study to determine the efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 monotherapy and/or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC chemotherapy (1:1 or 1:1:1, depending on 
whether there are 2 or 3 treatment arms).  Approximately 125 additional patients per treatment 
arm will be planned for enrollment.  Treatment arms for MEDI4736 monotherapy and/or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab will only be included in the RCT if the corresponding treatment 
meets the appropriate criteria in Part A.  Randomization in Part B: RCT will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_514237]-line chemotherapy (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD]) versus no response (progressive disease [PD]) and according to prior 
first-line chemotherapy, 5-FU-containing versus gemcitabine-containing.
Tumor assessments will be performed every 6 weeks ±[ADDRESS_666317] infusion and then every 12 weeks ±7 days thereafter until confirmed PD, with 
categorization of objective tumor response by [CONTACT_16622], 
Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

Edition Number [ADDRESS_666321] 2015
6(131)Patients in the MEDI4736 monotherapy treatment arm who develop PD after completing 12 
months of therapy may restart their assigned treatment with the same treatment guidelines 
followed previously.  Patients in the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab arm may restart treatment if they complete the 4 dosing cycles with MEDI4736 + tremelimumab (with clinical benefit per 
Investigator judgement) but subsequently have confirmed progression of disease during or 
following treatment with MEDI4736 alone.  
Patients who have discontinued all study treatment will enter follow-up.
Investigational product, dosage, and mode of administration
MEDI4736 monotherapy treatment arm
! 1.5 g MEDI4736 via IV infusion q4w, starting at Week 0, for up to a total of 
12 months (up to 13 doses)
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy treatment arm
! 1.5 g MEDI4736 by [CONTACT_16228] q4w and 75 mg tremelimumab q4w by [CONTACT_514239] 0 (up to 4 doses each), followed by 1.5 g MEDI4736 monotherapy by [CONTACT_16228] q4w (starting on Week 16) to complete a total of 12 months of 
therapy (up to 9 additional doses) 
Standard of Care (Part B: Randomized, controlled trial only)
! Gemcitabine-based or fluorouracil-based chemotherapy administered per local 
guidelines
Statistical methods
For each arm in Part A (Lead-in) of the study, once [ADDRESS_666322]-baseline tumor assessments (at Weeks 6 and 12), predictive probability will be calculated to assess the chance of observing at least 5 out of 30 responses (>15% ORR [CR or PR], 
and/or at least 15/30 DCR at 12 weeks ( ≥50% DCR12) in that arm.  If, predictive probability 
is below 10% for both endpoints, enrollment into the arm in which this happens will be stopped.  A different decision outside of these criteria may be made, if the totality of the data 
supports it.  Recruitment will continue while predictive probability is evaluated.  If enrollment 
into an arm is to be stopped based on <10% predictive probability, no new patients will be recruited, but patients who are already on study will continue in accordance with study 
guidelines.  If enrollment is fast enough so that, by [CONTACT_29623] 15 patients are evaluable (Weeks 
6 and 12 tumor assessment data available), all [ADDRESS_666323] already been randomized, then the predictive probability calculations will not be carried out.  
If the ORR in Part A is >25% (ie, ≥8 responses from 30 patients in an arm), then an additional 
70 patients will be enrolled to that arm (Part B: Expansion) to evaluate ORR in 100 patients in total (unless the totality of the data supports a different decision).  In the Part B: Expansion 
study, the primary endpoint, ORR, will be evaluated using a 2-sided, 95% Clopper-Pearson

7(131)confidence interval to the observed ORR in the expanded cohort of 100 patients. With 
100 patients, there will be >90% power to reject the null hypothesis of a 10% response rate 
assuming a true response rate of 25% at 5% (2-sided) significance level (critical value ORR of 16.7%), while also providing adequate patients to reasonably characterize the safety profile of 
the expanded arm(s).  A 10% response rate is considered a reasonable assumption for the 
average response rate achieved by [CONTACT_286995][INVESTIGATOR_514203]-line advanced pancreatic cancer (Rahma et al 2013 ).
If the ORR in Part A is >15% (ie, ≥5 responses from 30 treated patients in an arm), then a 
randomized, controlled substudy may be initiated (Part B: RCT).  If initiated, this substudywill be a randomized, open- label, multi-center, study to determine the efficacy and safety of 
MEDI4736 monotherapy and/or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC 
chemotherapy (randomized 1:1 or 1:1:1, depending on whether there are 2 or 3 treatment arms) with a primary endpoint of OS. If both arms move forward to part B, then the primary 
comparison will be conducted on MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus 
SoC chemotherapy.  Approximately 125 additional patients per treatment arm will be planned for enrollment in this Part B: RCT. Treatment for MEDI4736 monotherapy and/or 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab will only be included in the RCT if the corresponding treatment 
meets the appropriate criteria for Part A.  A final decision to initiate the randomized portion of the study will be made after evaluation of all available efficacy and safety data from the 
lead-in phase, and may not be limited to the decision rules provided in the protocol.  With 
125 patients per arm for a 2-arm study, 196 events (78% maturity) would provide 90% power to detect a true average hazard ratio of 0.63 at a 2-sided 5% significance level (critical value 
for hazard ratio of 0.75). This assumes a median OS in the SoC arm of 5 months and a 
2-month delay in survival curves separating.  The data from Part B: RCT will be analyzed separately and will not be pooled with Part A for the purpose of statistical analysis.  
For Part B: RCT, the randomization schedule will be stratified by [CONTACT_514240]-line chemotherapy (CR, PR, or SD) versus no response (PD), and by [CONTACT_514241]-line chemotherapy, 5FU-containing versus gemcitabine-containing. The primary endpoint, OS, 
will be compared between treatments based on the hazard ratio, with 95% confidence 
intervals.  The hazard ratio will be estimated using a stratified log rank test.  If both arms are taken forward from Part A, then the primary comparison will be to compare MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC.  MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC will be 
compared hierarchically in order to strongly control the type I error. Full details of the multiple testing procedure will be provided in the SAP.  
Secondary endpoints, including DoR, DCR, PFS, PFS2, PFS3 and PFS6, will be summarized 
based on Investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1.  PFS, PFS2, PFS3, PFS6, OS, OS6, OS12, and DoR rates and their medians will be calculated and plotted using 
Kaplan-Meier estimates, with 95% confidence intervals.  Safety and tolerability will be 
evaluated through AEs, physical examinations, laboratory and vital sign measures, and electrocardiograms, using summary statistics.  Disease-related symptoms and health-related 
quality of life will be assessed through an analysis of the EORTC QLQ-C30 global quality of 
life (QoL) and QLQ-PAN26 pancreatic pain scales.  Adjusted mean change from baseline in

8(131)global QoL score will be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
analysis of all of the post-baseline scores for each visit and will be presented by [CONTACT_6490].  As a supportive analysis, global QoL improvement rate will be analyzed using a logistic regression model.  An exploratory analysis will examine adjusted mean change from 
baseline on EORTC QLQ-C30 functioning domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and 
social) and on EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 symptom scales/items (including pancreatic pain, fatigue, nausea, weight loss [difficulty gaining weight/loss of appetite], and 
jaundice).  EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 compliance (overall compliance and by [CONTACT_514242]) will be summarized for each treatment group.

21(131)1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which accounts for more than 90% of all 
pancreatic tumors, is a malignancy with an extremely poor prognosis, as shown by a 1-year 
survival rate of around 18% for all stages of the disease and an estimated 5-year survival rate 
of less than 5%.  The low survival rates associated with PDAC primarily reflect the fact that tumors progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_514206] (almost 80% of patients at diagnosis; Hidalgo et al 2015 ).
Metastatic PDAC is one of the most aggressive and highly lethal malignancies.  Although it 
constitutes only about 3% of all cancers in the [LOCATION_002] (US), it is the fourth leading 
cause of cancer deaths in both men and women and is responsible for 7% of all cancer-related 
deaths.  The death rate from the disease rose from 5 per 100000 in 1930 to more than 10 per 100000 in 2003.  The American Cancer Society estimates that in the US in 2014, about 
[ZIP_CODE] people ([ZIP_CODE] men and [ZIP_CODE] women) will die of pancreatic cancer 
(Dragovich et al 2014 ).  In the absence of predisposing conditions, such as familial pancreatic 
cancer and chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer is unusual in persons younger than 45 years.  
After age 50 years, the frequency of pancreatic cancer increases linearly.  The median age at 
diagnosis is 69 years in whites and 65 years in blacks; some single-institution data reported from large cancer centers suggest that the median age at diagnosis in both sexes has fallen to 
63 years.  
The poor prognosis reflects the limited treatment options available, highlighting the need for 
the development of newer therapeutic options.  Very few patients with truly localized disease 
can be cured by [CONTACT_44850].  Inoperable patients sometimes undergo surgery for symptom relief 
(eg, by[CONTACT_514243], splanchnicectomy), but the main treatment is radiation and chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy is used to control local symptoms like pain but has no 
proven effect on overall survival (OS; Thota et al 2014 ).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_514207], there has been limited progress in therapeutic options for 
metastatic disease.  Over the past [ADDRESS_666347] of care (SoC) for patients with 
metastatic pancreatic cancer for several years until combination therapy with gemcitabine plus 
erlotinib was shown to increase median survival by [CONTACT_3450] 2 weeks.  A Phase III trial of gemcitabine versus fluoropyrimidine (5-FU) as first-line therapy in patients with advanced 
or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas reported a significant improvement in survival 
among patients treated with gemcitabine (median survival durations were 5.65 and 4.41 months for gemcitabine-treated and 5-FU-treated patients, respectively [p=0.0025]).  The 
survival rate at 12 months was 18% for gemcitabine patients and 2% for 5-FU patients ( Burris 
et al 1997 ).  
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666348] 2015
22(131)The National Cancer Institute of Canada performed a Phase III trial (CAN-NCIC-PA3 
[[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) that compared gemcitabine alone versus the combination of gemcitabine 
and erlotinib (100 mg/day) for first-line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic carcinomas.  The corresponding median survival rate for patients receiving 
erlotinib was 6.2 months versus 5.9 months for patients receiving placebo.  The 1-year 
survival rate for patients receiving erlotinib was 23% versus 17% for patients receiving placebo ( Moore et al 2007 ).  However, the modest survival benefit was tempered by a 
significant side effect profile and the high cost of treatment ( Moore et al 2007 ). Later, the 
multidrug combination of leucovorin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) was noted to provide an increased median survival of 4.3 months versus gemcitabine; 
however, given its side effect profile, it is available only to a select group of patients with 
advanced pancreatic cancer.  The patients were randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine.  The median OS was 11.1 months in the FOLFIRINOX group compared with 
6.8 months in the gemcitabine group (hazard ratio [HR] for death =0.57; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.73; p<0.001).  Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.4 months in the FOLFIRINOX group and 3.3 months in the gemcitabine group (HR for disease 
progression =0.47; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.59; p<0.001; Conroy et al 2011 ).
Recently, the gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel combination was shown to increase median 
survival by 1.8 months, with increased OS at 1 and 2 years; adverse effects were reasonable 
and included cytopenias and peripheral neuropathy.  The multi-center, international Phase III 
trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) included 861 patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  The patients were randomly assigned to receive gemcitabine and 
nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine monotherapy.  The median OS was 8.5 months in the 
nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine group compared with 6.7 months in the gemcitabine group (HR for death=0.72; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.83; p<0.001).  Median PFS was 5.5 months in the 
nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine group and 3.7 months in the gemcitabine group (HR for disease 
progression=0.69; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.82, p<0.001; Von Hoff et al 2013 ).
The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommendations suggest acceptable 
first-line chemotherapy combinations for patients with good performance status (ie, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status [PS] of 0 or 1), good pain management, patent biliary stent, and adequate nutritional intake; these combinations include 
FOLFIRINOX, nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine, and gemcitabine plus erlotinib.  The only 
recommended first-line chemotherapy option for patients with poor PS is gemcitabine monotherapy.  The guidelines for choosing an appropriate treatment regimen for patients with 
metastatic pancreatic cancer thus remain ambiguous, and in the absence of a randomized trial 
comparing the combination regimens head to head, the dilemma remains regarding appropriate first-line therapy for these patients.  
Invariably, regardless of choice of first-line therapy, patients with advanced/metastatic disease 
will progress, and at that point, the choice of treatment becomes considerably murkier.  According to results from a US cooperative group trial (CALGB [ZIP_CODE]), fewer than half of 
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer went on to receive any additional therapy after 
progressing on first-line study treatment.  This reflects, in part, the fact that patients in this 
Clinical Study Protocol

23(131)setting frequently demonstrate significant clinical deterioration and a decline in PS and are no 
longer deemed appropriate candidates for further anticancer therapy.
Currently, there is no firmly established standard chemotherapy for patients after progression 
on first-line treatment.  A variety of cytotoxic agents, either alone or in combination, have 
been evaluated, although primarily in the context of small single-arm or retrospective studies.  
Most regimens have been associated with median PFS in the range of 2 to 4 months, OS ranges between 4 and 8 months, and different response rates varying from 10% to 20%, 
highlighting the very poor prognosis of patients who are candidates for such treatment
(Walker and Ko 2014 ).  Targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_514208]-refractory setting, 
meanwhile, have produced even worse efficacy results ( Li et al 2014 , Walker and Ko 2014 ).  
The combination of 5-FU and oxaliplatin has been shown to confer a benefit in the second-
line setting after first-line gemcitabine in a small clinical trial and can be considered as a treatment option in this setting.  In patients treated with first-line FOLFIRINOX who can 
receive second-line chemotherapy after progression, gemcitabine can be considered as an 
option ( NCCN Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Guidelines ).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_514209], enrollment 
of patients with pancreatic cancer in clinical trials for all lines of treatment should be 
encouraged to further improve the systemic treatment of this disease ( Seufferlein et al 2012 ).
1.1.1 Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_514210], and under 
some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors 
(Dunn et al 2004 ).  Studies in mouse models of transplantable tumors have demonstrated that
manipulation of co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory signals can amplify T-cell responses against tumors ( Peggs et al 2009 ).  This amplification may be accomplished by [CONTACT_27640]-inhibitory 
molecules, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte- associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or programmed 
cell death 1 (PD-1), from binding with their ligands, B7 or B7-homolog 1 (B7-H1) (programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1]).
1.1.2 MEDI4736
MEDI4736 is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa 
subclass that inhibits the binding of PD-L1 and is being developed by [CONTACT_38227]/MedImmune for use in the treatment of cancer (MedImmune is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of [COMPANY_008]; [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune will be referred to as [COMPANY_008] 
throughout this document).  As MEDI4736 is an engineered mAb, it does not induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity.  The 
proposed mechanism of action for MEDI4736 is interference of the interaction of PD-L1.
PD-L1 is frequently found to be expressed on many cancers with a high frequency, up to 88% 
in some cancer types. Tumors expressing PD-L1 can render cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) 
inactive or nonfunctional through engagement of the inhibitory receptor of PD-1. Pancreatic 
cancers that are PD-L1 positive have been found to have significantly poorer 1-year postoperative survival and OS compared to tumors that are PD-L1 negative ( Nomi et al 2007 ).
Results of several preclinical models have demonstrated that blockade of PD-[ADDRESS_666350] 2015
24(131)the use of PD-1-deficient T cells, can result in profound immune-mediated tumor control in 
many experimental systems ( Blank et al 2006 , Iwai et al 2002 , Iwai et al 2005 ).
During the last decade, there has been a progressively increased interest in studying the 
therapeutic potential of immune therapy in PDAC.  Several lines of evidence documenting the 
immune dysfunction associated with PDAC support the hypothesis that immunotherapy can 
alter the process of carcinogenesis ( Fokas et al 2015 ).
In particular, preclinical and clinical studies in PDAC have indicated that blockades of 
immune checkpoints can have a positive effect on antitumor immunity.  In fact, PD-L1-
expression is directly related to a poorer prognosis and reduced number of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes, particularly cluster of differentiation (CD) 8(+) T cells.  mAbs against PD-L1 
or PD-[ADDRESS_666351] on murine pancreatic cancer in vivo.  PD-L1 
blockades promoted CD8(+) T-cell infiltration into the tumor and induced local immune activation.  Furthermore, the combination of anti-PD-L1 mAb and gemcitabine exhibited a 
significant synergistic effect on murine pancreatic cancer and resulted in complete response 
(CR) without overt toxicity ( Nomi et al 2007 ).  Available clinical data derived from a clinical 
trial evaluating a single agent showed a modest clinical activity together with a tolerable 
safety profile, suggesting the possibility to evaluate an alternative development strategy, such 
as combination with different compounds.
Treatment of 14 patients with PDAC with BMS-936559, a novel anti-PD-L1 antibody, 
showed no response in any of the treated patients ( Brahmer et al 2012 ).  Similarly, in a 
Phase II trial in 27 patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDAC receiving the anti-CTLA-4 agent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], there were no responders by [CONTACT_392] (RECIST), but a patient experienced a delayed response after initial progressive 
disease (PD; Pardoll 2012 , Royal et al 2010 ).  Preliminary data from 
Study CD ON-MEDI4736-1108 (referred to hereafter as Study 1108), a Phase I multi-arm 
expansion study of MEDI4736, showed 2 partial responses (PRs) in 29 evaluable patients 
(Segal et al 2014 ).
As an antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors, MEDI4736 may 
relieve PD-L1-dependent immunosuppressive effects and, therefore, enhance the cytotoxic 
activity of antitumor T cells.  This hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_514244]-L1/PD-[ADDRESS_666352], which provide early evidence of clinical 
activity and a manageable safety profile ( Brahmer et al 2012 , Topalian et al 2012 ).  To date, 
the responses tend to be more frequent in patients with tumors that express PD-L1 (PD-L1-positive), although, importantly, responses are also seen in patients with tumors that 
are non/low expressors of PD-L1.
MEDI4736 has been given to humans as part of ongoing studies as a single drug or in 
combination with other drugs.  As of [ADDRESS_666353] been enrolled and 
treated in 10 ongoing clinical studies on MEDI4736 (with 5 studies using MEDI4736 as 
monotherapy and 5 studies using MEDI4736 in combination therapy). Details on the safety profile of MEDI4736 are summarized in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Refer to the current MEDI4736

1.1.3 Tremelimumab
Tremelimumab, a CTLA-4 mAb of the IgG 2 kappa isotype, is an immunomodulatory therapy 
(IMT) that is being developed by [CONTACT_83747].  
Tremelimumab is a human IgG [ADDRESS_666355] CTLA-4.   
Binding of CTLA-4 to its target ligands (B7-1 and B7-2) provides a negative regulatory 
signal, which limits T-cell activation.  Anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors antagonize the binding of 
CTLA-4 to B7 ligands and enhance human T-cell activation as demonstrated by [CONTACT_514245] (interleukin [IL]-2 and interferon–gamma [IFN- ∀]) production in vitro in whole 
blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures ( Tarhini and Kirkwood 2008 ).  
In addition, blockade of CTLA-4 binding to B7 by [CONTACT_14181]-CTLA-4 antibodies results in 
markedly enhanced T-cell activation and antitumor activity in animal models, including killing of established murine solid tumors and induction of protective antitumor immunity.  
(Refer to the current tremelimumab IB for more information.)  Therefore, it is expected that 
treatment with an anti-CTLA-[ADDRESS_666356], a recently completed Phase II trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) showed 
that anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy is ineffective in this patient population, only one patient 
experienced a delayed response after initial progressive disease ( Royal et al 2010 ).
An extensive program of nonclinical and clinical studies has been conducted for 
tremelimumab both as monotherapy and combination therapy with conventional anticancer 
agents to support various cancer indications using different dose schedules.  As of the data cutoff date of 12 November 2014 (for all studies except Study D4190C00006, which has a 
cutoff date of 4 December 2014), [ADDRESS_666357] received tremelimumab monotherapy 
(excluding [ADDRESS_666358] been treated in the blinded Phase IIb study, D4880C00003) and [ADDRESS_666359] received tremelimumab in combination with other agents.  More than 
800 of these patients had melanoma and were treated at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 90 days.  
Details on the safety profile of tremelimumab monotherapy are summarized in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Refer to the current tremelimumab IB for a complete summary of nonclinical 
and clinical information; see Section 6.7for guidance on management of tremelimumab-
related toxicities. 
Tremelimumab exhibited a biphasic pharmacokinetic (PK) profile with a long-terminal phase 
half-life of 22 days.  Overall, a low incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs; <6%) was 
observed in treatment with tremelimumab.

26(131)therefore, [COMPANY_008] is also investigating the use of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy for the treatment of cancer.
Study D4190C00006 is a Phase Ib dose-escalation study to establish safety, 
PK/pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  The 
dosing schedule utilized is MEDI4736 every 2 or 4 weeks (q2w; q4w) up to Week 48 (12 months), combined with tremelimumab q4w up to Week 24 for 7 doses, then 
tremelimumab every 12 weeks (q12w) for [ADDRESS_666362] received between 1 and 13 doses of MEDI4736 and between 1 and 9 doses of tremelimumab.  Details on the safety profile of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination 
therapy are summarized in Sections 1.2.1 and [IP_ADDRESS] .  Refer to the current MEDI4736 IB and 
tremelimumab IB for a complete summary of nonclinical and clinical information; see Section 6.7for guidance on management of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab-related toxicities.
As of 27 January 2015 in Study D4190C00006, an approximately dose-proportional increase 
in PK exposure (maximum plasma concentration [C
max], trough plasma concentration [C trough], 
and area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve from time zero to Day [ADDRESS_666363]-dose 
[AUC 0-28day ]) of both MEDI4736 and tremelimumab was observed over the dose range of 3 to 
20 mg/kg MEDI4736 q4w or q2w and 1 to 10 mg/kg tremelimumab q4w.  Four of [ADDRESS_666364]-treatment; MEDI4736 PK was impacted in only 2 of these 4 patients.  Complete soluble 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (sPD-L1) suppression (surrogate for PD-L1 targeting) was observed in almost all patients over the dose range of 3 to 20 mg/kg of MEDI4736 q4w or 
q2w.
1.1.[ADDRESS_666365] in human study (Study 1108) indicate encouraging response rates and 
duration of response (DoR) with a manageable safety profile in patients with a variety of solid 
malignancies, including a heterogeneous population of heavily pretreated patients with pancreatic cancer treated with MEDI4736 as monotherapy.  
Combining multiple immunotherapy agents has been shown to result in improved response 
rates relative to monotherapy, for example, the concurrent administration of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_514211] 
(ORRs) than those obtained with single-agent therapy.  Importantly, responses appeared to be 
deep and durable ( Wolchok et al 2013 ).  The rationale for evaluating the combination of

27(131)MEDI4736 with tremelimumab is that the mechanisms of CTLA-[ADDRESS_666367] additive or synergistic activity 
(Pardoll 2012 ).  Similar results have been observed in an ongoing study of MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab in NSCLC ( Antonia et al 2014a ), with further updated details presented in this 
clinical study protocol (CSP).
Chemotherapy, a mainstay intervention for cancer since the 1940s, has the potential to debulk 
the primary tumor mass and, therefore, can be used to alter the tumor microenvironment, 
thereby [CONTACT_514246].
Although chemotherapeutic drugs induce their primary damage in many different ways, most 
of them kill tumor cells by [CONTACT_514247].  The massive apoptosis induced by 
[CONTACT_514248]-inflammatory mediators, such as heat-shock proteins, that act 
as danger signals and can activate dendritic cells through the toll-like receptor signaling pathways, thus engaging the innate immune response.  It could also induce cytokine 
production patterns typi[INVESTIGATOR_252854] T-helper, type I phenotype, thereby [CONTACT_514249] T-cell responses ( Zwierzina 2008 ).
There is evidence that tumor-derived antigens induce tolerance during tumor progression.  In 
mice, for example, persistent presentation of a tumor antigen causes cytotoxic T cells that 
were once active against the antigen to become tolerant, resulting in tumor outgrowth.  Interestingly, functional capacities are regained when T cells are transferred to an antigen-free 
environment.  The elimination of persistent tolerogenic tumor antigen environment via 
chemotherapy-induced debulking may play a role in generating an effective immune response (Drake 2012 ).
Another way in which cytotoxic drugs can make the tumor microenvironment more conducive 
to an effective immune response is by [CONTACT_514250] (MHC) molecules that have been lost during tumor progression or 
upregulating the expression of costimulatory molecules (B7-1 and B7-2), thereby [CONTACT_514251].  Others (5-fluorouracil and cisplatin) sensitize tumor cells to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)-mediated apoptosis 
through Fas- or perforin/granzyme-mediated pathways ( Emens and Jaffee 2005 ).
Chemotherapy, even at conventional doses, can eliminate myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
(MDSC) and Tregs, thus removing some of the immune suppressive factors present in cancer 
patients.  Cytotoxic drugs can modulate systemic mechanisms of active immune suppression 
or amplify expansion of antigen-specific T-cell expansion via cytoreduction by [CONTACT_514252] ( Emens and Jaffee 2005 ).
Moreover, cytoreductive chemotherapy generates a plethora of tumor-associated antigens, 
which are expressed in the context of MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells and can 
potentially initiate antigen-specific T-cell activation.  Furthermore, tumors carry many 
mutations, and there is clear evidence that most tumors express neo-antigens against which the host has a capacity to react.  Conventional chemotherapy could unmask additional tumor

28(131)neo-antigens and thus increase the amount of material available for cross-priming ( Emens and 
Jaffee 2005 ).
This immune response is driven by [CONTACT_514253], followed 
by [CONTACT_514254], migration to lymph nodes, and priming of tumor-specific CD8+ CTL in a 
type I interferon-dependent manner.  An antigen density within the tumor is an important 
determinant of the outcome of immune surveillance following chemotherapy (Kang et al 2013Kang et al 2013 ).
In this setting, immunotherapy has the potential to mount an ongoing and dynamic immune 
response that can kill tumor cells for an extended time after the conventional therapy has been administered.  This long-lasting response is potentially able to completely eradicate tumor 
cells rather than producing only a temporary killing of cells, in contrast to standard 
chemotherapy.  The most promising immune-based treatments are mAbs that act as checkpoint inhibitors (eg, MEDI4736 and tremelimumab), adoptive cell therapy (eg, T cells 
expressing chimeric antigen receptors), and vaccines (eg, sipuleucel-T).
Based on the preliminary clinical efficacy and safety data observed in the pancreatic cancer 
cohort of Study 1108 and the preliminary efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of MEDI4736 
+ tremelimumab combination therapy in Study D4190C00006 (a Phase Ib/II study of 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination in NSCLC), this study is being conducted todetermine the safety and efficacy of the combination of MEDI4736 with tremelimumab and 
MEDI4736 as monotherapy in a Phase II setting in PDAC.
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
This study will utilize an open-label design due to the different treatment administration 
schedules and treatment durations.
1.2.1 MEDI4736 and tremelimumab dose and treatment regimen justification
[IP_ADDRESS] MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy dose rationaleThe MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy doses and regimen selected for this 
study are based on the goal of selecting an optimal combination dose of MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab that would yield sustained target suppression (sPD-L1), demonstrate promising efficacy, and have an acceptable safety profile.  
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics data
In order to reduce the dosing frequency of MEDI4736 to align with the q4w dosing of 
tremelimumab, while ensuring an acceptable PK/pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy profile, cohorts in Study D4190C00006 were narrowed to 15 and 20 mg/kg MEDI4736 q4w.  
PK simulations from the MEDI4736 monotherapy data indicated that a similar area under the 
plasma drug concentration-time curve at steady state (AUC
ss; 4 weeks) was expected 
following both 10 mg/kg q2w and 20 mg/kg q4w MEDI4736.  The observed MEDI4736 PK 
data from the D4190C00006 study were well in line with the predicted monotherapy PK data 
developed preclinically.  This demonstrates similar exposure of MEDI4736 20 mg/kg q4w and

29(131)10 mg/kg q2w, with no alterations in PK when MEDI4736 and tremelimumab (doses ranging 
from 1 to 3 mg/kg) are dosed together.  While the median maximum plasma concentration at 
steady state (C max,ss) is expected to be higher with 20 mg/kg q4w (approximately 1.5 fold) and 
median trough concentration at steady state (C trough,ss ) is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg 
q2w (approximately 1.25 fold), this is not expected to impact the overall safety and efficacy 
profile, based on existing preclinical and clinical data.
Monotonic increases in pharmacodynamic activity were observed with increasing doses of 
tremelimumab relative to the activity observed in patients treated with MEDI4736 
monotherapy.  There was evidence of augmented pharmacodynamic activity relative to MEDI4736 monotherapy with combination doses containing 1 mg/kg tremelimumab,
inclusive of both the 15 and 20 mg/kg MEDI4736 plus 1 mg/kg tremelimumab combinations.  
Clinical data
As of [ADDRESS_666370] received between 1 and 9 doses of tremelimumab and between 1 and 13 doses of MEDI4736.  Various dose combinations were explored, with doses of tremelimumab ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg and doses of MEDI4736 ranging from 3 to 20 mg/kg.  Fifty-eight of these patients were in the q4w dosing schedule and [ADDRESS_666371] optimizes the risk:benefit profile in an acceptable range of PK and pharmacodynamic values.
Patients treated with doses of tremelimumab above 1 mg/kg had a higher rate of adverse 
events (AEs), including discontinuations due to AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), and severe AEs.  Between the 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab and 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 3 mg/kg tremelimumab cohorts treated at the q2w schedule, the number of patients reporting any AE, Grade 3 AEs, SAEs, and treatment-related AEs was higher in the 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 3 mg/kg tremelimumab cohort than the 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab cohort.  A similar pattern was noted in the q4w regimens, suggesting that, as the dose of tremelimumab increased above 1 mg/kg, a higher rate of treatment-related events may be anticipated.  Further, the SAEs frequently attributed to immunotherapy, pneumonitis and colitis, were more commonly seen in cohorts using either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of tremelimumab compared to the 1-mg/kg dose cohorts.  Together, these data suggest that a combination using a tremelimumab dose of 1 mg/kg appeared to minimize the rate of toxicity when combined with MEDI4736.  As a result, all combination doses utilizing either the 3 or 10-mg/kg doses of tremelimumab were eliminated in the final dose selection.
In contrast, cohorts assessing higher doses of MEDI4736 with a constant dose of 
tremelimumab did not show an increase in the rate of AEs.  The data suggested that increasing doses of MEDI4736 may not impact the safety of the combination as much as the tremelimumab dose.  Further, safety data between the 10-mg/kg and 20-mg/kg cohorts were similar, with no change in safety events with increasing dose of MEDI4736.
In Study D4190C00006, of all treatment cohorts, the cohort of 11 patients treated in the 
20 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab group had the fewest AEs, Grade ≥[ADDRESS_666372] 2015
30(131)activity.  This cohort had a lower number of treatment-related Grade ≥3 AEs or treatment 
related SAEs.  No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported.  
Preliminary clinical activity of the MEDI4736 and tremelimumab combination did not appear 
to change with increasing doses of tremelimumab.  The 15- and 20-mg/kg MEDI4736 q4w cohorts demonstrated objective responses at all doses of tremelimumab, and increasing doses of tremelimumab did not provide deeper or more rapid responses.
Efficacy data suggested that the 20 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose cohort 
may demonstrate equivalent clinical activity to other dose combinations.  A total of 5 of 11 patients in the 20 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab cohort were evaluable for efficacy with at least 8 weeks of follow-up.  Of these, there were 2 patients (40%) with PR, 1 patient (20%) with SD, and 1 patient (20%) with PD.  (The fifth patient had only a single scan, which was conducted outside the window for these evaluations.)
Additionally, of all cohorts, the 20 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose cohort 
had the fewest AEs, Grade ≥3 AEs, SAEs, and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, but still 
showed some evidence of clinical activity.  All together, the data suggested that a 20 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose combination should be selected for further development.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for 4 cycles of combination therapy followed by [CONTACT_46054]4736 
monotherapy
Long-term follow up on melanoma patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], an anti-CTLA-4 
targeting antibody (dosed every 3 weeks for 4 doses and then discontinued), shows that 
patients responding to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62605]-term benefit, with a 3-year OS rate of approximately 22%.  Furthermore, the survival curve in this population reached a plateau at 
3 years and was maintained through 10 years of follow up ( Schadendorf et al 2013 ). 
Similar data have been presented for other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting antibodies: 
! Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) was dosed q2w for up to 96 weeks in a large Phase I 
dose-escalation and expansion study, and showed responses were maintained for a median of 22.94 months for melanoma (doses 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg), 17 months 
for NSCLC (doses 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg), and 12.9 months for renal cell carcinoma patients (doses 1 and 10 mg/kg) at the time of data analysis ( Brahmer et al 2014 , 
Drake et al 2013 , Hodi et al 2014 ).  Furthermore, responses were maintained 
beyond treatment discontinuation in the majority of patients who stopped nivolumab treatment (either due to protocol specified end of treatment, CR, or 
toxicity) for up to 56 weeks at the time of data analysis ( Topalian et al 2014 ). 
! MPDL3280a (anti-PD-L1) and the combination of nivolumab with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], in 
which patients were dosed for a finite time period and responses maintained beyond 
treatment discontinuation have been reported ( Herbst et al 2013 , Wolchok et al 
2013 ).

31(131)Similar long term results may be expected with use of other immune-mediated cancer 
therapeutics including anti-CTLA-4 antibodies such as tremelimumab, anti PD-L1 antibodies 
such as MEDI4736, or the combination of the two. 
The MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination regimen will be administered for 4 doses 
followed by 1.5 g MEDI4736 monotherapy q4w.
[IP_ADDRESS] MEDI4736 monotherapy dose rationale
A dose of MEDI4736 20 mg/kg q4w is supported by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-vitro data, non-clinical activity, 
clinical PK/pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, and activity data from Study 1108 in patients 
with advanced solid tumors (ongoing first-time-in-humans study) and from a Phase I trial 
performed in Japanese patients with solid tumor ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
PK/Pharmacodynamic data
Based on available PK/pharmacodynamic data from ongoing Study 1108 with doses ranging 
from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg q2w or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3w), MEDI4736 exhibited non-linear (dose-dependent) PK consistent with target-mediated drug disposition.  The PK approached linearity at ≥3 mg/kg q2w, suggesting near complete target saturation (membrane-bound and 
sPD-L1), and further shows that the MEDI4736 dosing frequency can be adapted to a particular regimen given the linearity seen at higher doses than 3 mg/kg.   The expected half-life with doses ≥3 mg/kg q2w is approximately [ADDRESS_666374] been observed over the dose range of 0.1 to 15 mg/kg.  A low level of immunogenicity has been observed.  No patients have experienced immune-complex disease following exposure to MEDI4736.  Of the 220 patients who received MEDI4736 monotherapy and for whom PK/ADA data were available as of14 July 2014, [ADDRESS_666375] on PK/pharmacodynamics reported in 1 patient at 3 mg/kg.  
Data from Study 006 (Phase I trial in NSCLC patients using the combination of MEDI4736 
and tremelimumab) also show an approximately dose-proportional increase in PK exposure for MEDI4736 over the dose range of 3 to 20 mg/kg MEDI4736 q4w or q2w.  (For further information on PK observations in Study 006, please refer to Section 1.2.1 ).  
The observed MEDI4736 PK data from the combination study were well in line with the 
predicted monotherapy PK data (5
thmedian and 95thpercentiles) for a q4w regimen.  (For 
further information on PK observations in Study 006, please refer to Section 1.2.1 ).
A population PK model was developed using the data from Study 1108 (doses=0.1 to 
10 mg/kg q2w or 15 mg/kg q3w; Fairman et al 2014 ).  Multiple simulations indicate that a 
similar overall exposure is expected following both 10 mg/kg q2w and 20 mg/kg q4w 
regimens, as represented by [CONTACT_453758](4 weeks).  Median C max,ss is expected to be higher with 
20 mg/kg q4w (~1.5 fold) and median C trough,ss is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg q2w 
(~1.25 fold).  Clinical activity with the 20 mg/kg q4w dosing regimen is anticipated to be consistent with 10 mg/kg q2w with the proposed similar dose of 20 mg/kg q4w expected to

32(131)(a) achieve complete target saturation in majority of patients; (b) account for anticipated 
variability in PK, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity in diverse cancer populations; (c) maintain sufficient PK exposure in case of ADA impact; and (d) achieve PK exposure that yielded maximal antitumor activity in animal models.
Given the similar area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) and modest 
differences in median peak and trough levels at steady state, the observation that both regimens maintain complete sPD-L1 suppression at trough, and the available clinical data, the 20 mg/kg q4w and 10 mg/kg q2w regimens are expected to have similar efficacy and safety profiles, supporting further development with a dose of 20 mg/kg q4w.  
Clinical data
As of 8 April 2015, there is initial safety data for 16 patients receiving the 20 mg/kg q4w
dosing regimen (12 patients from Study 1108 and 4 patients from the Japan Phase I trial).  The 
toxicities observed with 20 mg/kg q4w are consistent with the 10 mg q2w regimen, and there were no DLTs observed.  Of the 12 patients in Study 1108, 42% of patients have experienced 
any grade AE, with 2 being Grade 3 and above (17%).  None of the Grade [ADDRESS_666377] that the safety profile of MEDI4736 
will be different in the 20 mg/kg q4w dosing regimen when compared to 10 mg/kg q2w 
regimen.  In fact, as of [ADDRESS_666378] received MEDI4736, predominantly at 10 mg/kg q2w (either in the dose-escalation or dose-expansion 
phase of the study).  Data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
meeting [ADDRESS_666379] 2014 showed that MEDI4736 was well tolerated at all doses in the NSCLC subset of patients enrolled into Study 1108, with 
drug-related Grade ≥3 AEs reported in 3% of patients and drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation reported in 1% of patients.  No drug-related colitis or hyperglycemia of any grade, no Grade ≥3 pneumonitis reported, and no drug-related AEs leading to death were 
reported ( Antonia et al 2014b ).  No DLTs were observed up to a dose of 10 mg/kg q2w or 
15 mg/kg q3w.
Efficacy data on the NSCLC patients in Study 1108, presented at ESMO 2014 (cutoff date of 
[ADDRESS_666380] 2014), showed a DCR at 12 weeks of 41% and ORR of 16% among 162 evaluable 
patients, with activity observed in both squamous and non-squamous histologies.  The ORR was higher (25%; 12 CR/PR; n=48) in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors, defined as those 
with ≥25% of tumor cells with membrane staining for PD-L1, compared to patients with 
PD-L1 negative tumors (10%; 7 CR/PR; n=74) ( Antonia et al 2014b ).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for fixed dosing
A population PK model was developed for MEDI4736 using monotherapy data from 
Study 1108 (Phase I study; N=292; doses=0.1 to 10 mg/kg q2w or 15 mg/kg q3w; solid 
tumors).  Population PK analysis indicated only a minor impact of body weight (WT) on the PK of MEDI4736 (coefficient of ≤0.5).  The impact of body WT-based (10 mg/kg q2w) and 
fixed dosing (750 mg q2w) of MEDI4736 was evaluated by [CONTACT_514255] (5
th, median, and 95thpercentiles) using the population PK model.  A fixed 
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666381] 2015
33(131)dose of 750 mg was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on a median body WT of 
approximately 75 kg).  A total of 1000 patients were simulated using a body WT distribution 
of 40 to 120 kg.  Simulation results demonstrated that body WT-based and fixed dosing regimens yield similar median steady state PK concentrations with slightly less overall 
between-patient variability with the fixed dosing regimen.  
Similarly, a population PK model was developed for tremelimumab using data from Phase I 
through Phase III studies (N=654; doses=0.01 to 15 mg/kg q4w or every 90 days; metastatic 
melanoma; Wang et al 2014 ).  A population PK model indicated minor impact of body WT on 
the PK of tremelimumab (coefficient of ≤0.5).  The WT-based (1 mg/kg q4w) and fixed 
dosing (75 mg/kg q4w; based on a median body WT of approximately 75 kg) regimens were 
compared using predicted PK concentrations (5
th, median, and 95thpercentiles) using a 
population PK model in a simulated population of [ADDRESS_666382] been reported by [CONTACT_2312] ( Narwal et al 2013 , Ng et al 2006 , 
Wang et al 2009 , Zhang et al 2012 ).  Wang and colleagues investigated 12 mAbs and found 
that fixed and body size-based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being better for 7 of 12 antibodies ( Wang et al 2009 ).  In addition, they investigated 18 therapeutic proteins 
and peptides and showed that fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 in terms of reducing 
the between-patient variability in PK/pharmacodynamics parameters ( Zhang et al 2012 ). 
A fixed dosing approach is preferred by [CONTACT_27645].  Given the expectation of similar PK exposure and variability, 
[COMPANY_008] considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens.  Based on an average body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 1.5 g q4w MEDI4736 (equivalent to 20 mg/kg q4w) and 
75 mg q4w tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg q4w) is included in the current study.
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
The following sections include summaries of the potential benefits and risks associated with 
MEDI4736 monotherapy and MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy, respectively, prior to the overall benefit/risk assessment.
1.3.1 Potential benefits
[IP_ADDRESS] MEDI4736The majority of the safety and efficacy data currently available for MEDI4736 are based on 
the first time in-human, single-agent study (Study 1108) in patients with advanced solid tumors.  Updated efficacy data from Study [ADDRESS_666383] 2014, 373 patients with all tumor types
were evaluable for response analysis, including 352 patients receiving 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 q2w.  The DCR at 12 weeks in patients receiving 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 q2w was 33%, and the 
ORR was 10%.  Greater DCR at 12 weeks (47% versus 28%) and ORR (22% versus 5%)

34(131)were observed in PD-L1-positive versus PD-L1-negative patients.  Responses were ongoing in 
92% of patients, with an objective response duration ranging from 0.1 to 32 weeks 
(Segal et al 2014 ).  Of the 29 evaluable PDAC patients treated in Study 1108, 2 patients had 
PRs ( Segal et al 2014 ). Other mAbs targeting the PD-L1/PD-[ADDRESS_666385] shown clinical 
activity in this indication, as summarized in Section 1.1.4 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Tremelimumab
In a single-arm, Phase II study (Study A3671008) of tremelimumab administered at 15 mg/kg 
every 90 days to patients with refractory melanoma, an response rate of 7% and a median OS 
of 10 months in the second-line setting (as compared to approximately [ADDRESS_666386] 
supportive care reported from a retrospective analysis; Korn et al 2008 ) were observed 
(Kirkwood et al 2010 ).  In a randomized, open-label, first-line Phase III study of 
tremelimumab (administered at 15 mg/kg every 90 days) versus chemotherapy (dacarbazine or 
temozolomide) in advanced melanoma (Study A3671009), results of the final analysis showed a response rate of 11% and a median OS of 12.[ADDRESS_666387] chemotherapy; however, these results were not statistically 
significant ( Ribas et al 2013 ).  Additionally, in a Phase II maintenance study (Study 
A3671015) in patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC that have responded or remained stable, 
PFS at 3 months was 22.7% in the tremelimumab arm (15 mg/kg) compared with 11.9% in the 
best supportive care arm (Study A3671015).
[IP_ADDRESS] MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
The preclinical and clinical justification for this combination as noted in Section 1.2.[ADDRESS_666388] that the combination of agents targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-[ADDRESS_666389] profound and durable benefits in patients with melanoma ( Wolchok et al 2013 ).  Furthermore, 
preliminary efficacy data from Study D4190C00006 have demonstrated that this combination 
is clinically active and well tolerated.  As of 27 January 2015, 53 patients were evaluable for response across various MEDI4736 + tremelimumab dose regiments.  Of these, 
12 (23%) patients had a best response of PR and 14 (26%) patients had a best response of SD.  
In the MEDI4736 20 mg/kg + tremelimumab 1 mg/kg q4w cohort, a total of [ADDRESS_666390] 8 weeks of follow-up.  Of these, there were 
2 (40%) patients with PR, 1 (20%) patient with SD, and 1 (20%) patient with PD.
1.3.2 Potential risks
[IP_ADDRESS] MEDI4736Potential risks, based on the mechanism of action of MEDI4736 and related molecules, 
include immune-mediated reactions, such as enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis/hepatotoxicity,
endocrinopathy, pneumonitis, and neuropathy or neurologic events.  Additional important 
potential risks include infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis or serious allergic reactions, serious infections, and immune complex disease.  Of the 393 patients with 
advanced solid tumors including PDAC treated with 10 mg/kg q2w in Study 1108 (as of the 
current IB, Edition 7.0, cutoff date of 14 July 2014), 331 (84.2%) patients had at least 1 AE regardless of causality.  Treatment-related AEs were reported for 162 (41.2%) of [ADDRESS_666391] 2015
35(131)The most frequently reported ( ≥2% of patients) AEs assessed by [CONTACT_514256] (including all National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Event [CTCAE] grades) were fatigue (13.5%); nausea (8.4%); diarrhea, decreased appetite, and rash (5.3% each); vomiting (4.8%); pruritus (4.1%); dyspnea (3.8%); pyrexia 
(3.1%); hypothyroidism, increased alanine aminotransferase [ALT], increased aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST], and cough (2.5% each); myalgia (2.3%); and abdominal pain and dizziness (2.0% each).  Two patients discontinued treatment due to AEs assessed by [CONTACT_514257] (pneumonitis and increased transaminases).  Grade 3 events 
assessed by [CONTACT_514258] 2 or more patients were fatigue (4 patients); increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (3 patients); and vomiting, 
increased ALT, increased AST, and arthralgia (2 patients each).  There were 2 patients with 
Grade 4 events (hypercalcemia and fatigue) assessed by [CONTACT_514259] 1 patient with a Grade 5 event assessed by [CONTACT_514260] 
(angiopathy).  For further details on the safety profile of MEDI4736 as monotherapy or 
combination therapy, please refer to the current IB. 
Other mAbs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway are currently in clinical development.  Among 
the most frequent AEs noted with treatment with these antibodies are fatigue, rash, diarrhea, 
and pruritus.  Immune-mediated AEs of Grade ≥[ADDRESS_666392].  Other relevant risks include those associated with 
biological and immunotherapeutic agents, including infusion reactions and acute 
immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic reactions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tremelimumab
Potential risks, based on the mechanism of action of MEDI4736 and related molecules 
(ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) include potentially immune-mediated reactions that can result in an 
inflammatory response in any organ or tissue including the liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, thyroid glands, pancreas, skin, nervous system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], and adrenal glands.  The 
profile of AEs and the spectrum of event severity have remained stable across the 
tremelimumab clinical program and are consistent with the pharmacology of the target.  To date, no tumor type or stage appears to be associated with unique AEs (except for vitiligo that 
appears to be confined to patients with melanoma).  Overall, 944 (97.0%) of the [ADDRESS_666393] 1 AE.  The events resulted in discontinuation of tremelimumab in 
10.0% of patients, were serious in 36.5%, were Grade ≥3 in severity in 49.8%, were fatal in 
67.7%, and were considered to be treatment related in 79.1% of patients. Among the overall fatal cases (67.7%) reported in the patients treated with tremelimumab monotherapy, the most 
frequent cause of death was ascribed to the patient’s underlying malignant disease (61.8%), 
whereas the remaining causes included other or unknown/missing (7.1%), and due to investigational product (IP; 0.5%). The most frequent Grade ≥3 AEs (all causality) reported 
in ≥ 2% of subjects (in decreasing order of frequency) were diarrhea, fatigue, colitis, disease 
progression, dyspnea, dehydration/nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and asthenia. The events of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and colitis occurred at a higher rate in the 10 
mg/kg group, whereas fatigue, disease progression, dyspnea, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, 
decreased appetite, and asthenia were reported more frequently in the 15 mg/kg group.

and 80.0%, respectively), and were mostly Grade 1 or 2 in severity ( ≥ Grade 3 treatment-
related AEs reported in 26.1% of subjects). The most frequent treatment-related AEs (in > 5% of subjects) were diarrhea (41.2%), rash (27.2%), pruritus (25.1%), fatigue (23.8%), nausea

No safety studies in animals have been performed combining tremelimumab with MEDI4736.  
As both CTLA-[ADDRESS_666395] mechanisms of actions that enhance activation of immune 
cells, their potential to induce cytokine release was tested in a whole-blood assay system.  MEDI4736 and tremelimumab, either alone or in combination, did not induce cytokine release 
in blood from any donor.
Evaluation of the safety of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab in the ongoing Study D4190C00006, 
in patients with NSCLC, has so far shown a manageable safety and tolerability profile of the 
combination therapy. 
Overall, 62 (83.8%) of the [ADDRESS_666396] 
frequently (10 or more patients) reported AEs were fatigue (37.8%; 28 patients); diarrhea 
(32.4%; 24 patients); amylase increased and pruritus (16.2%; 12 patients); decreased appetite, 
dyspnea, nausea, and rash (14.9%; 11 patients each), and headache and pyrexia (13.5%; 10 patients).  Additional safety results from this study are presented in Section 1.2.1 and the 
MEDI4736 IB (Edition 7.0).
In the literature ( Wolchok et al 2013 ), using the combination of the same class of drugs 
(eg, anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies), specifically nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a study 
involving patients with malignant melanoma, the safety profile of this combination had shown 
occurrences of AEs assessed by [CONTACT_62646]-related in 93% of treated patients, with the most frequent events being rash (55% of patients), pruritus (47% of 
patients), fatigue (38% of patients), and diarrhea (34% of patients).  Grade 3 or 4 AEs, 
regardless of causality, were noted in 72% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 events assessed by [CONTACT_62646]-related in 53%.  The most frequent of these Grade 3 or 4 events 
assessed by [CONTACT_62646]-related include increased lipase (13% of patients), 
AST (13% of patients), and ALT levels (11% of patients).  Frequent Grade 3 or 4 selected AEs assessed by [CONTACT_62646]-related in the combination therapy included 
hepatic events (15% of patients), GI events (9% of patients), and renal events (6% of patients).  
Isolated cases of pneumonitis and uveitis were also observed. 
1.3.3 Overall benefit and risk assessment
There remains a significant unmet medical need for additional treatment options for patients 
with metastatic PDAC. 
Treatment with agents targeting PD-1/PD-L1 (such as MEDI4736) or CTLA-4 (such as 
tremelimumab) has shown activity in several tumor types in a subset of patients deriving 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666397] 2015
37(131)meaningful and durable benefit.  Efficacy data for patients treated with MEDI4736 
monotherapy in the pancreatic cancer cohort have shown some clinical activity.  Additionally, 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy has shown clinical activity in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.  Preliminary data generated 
from patients with NSCLC treated with MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy 
have also shown early signs of clinical activity, and data from competitors indicate that the combination may act synergistically ( Wolchok et al 2013 ).  Thus, these agents may potentially 
offer benefit to this patient population.  
The study design aims to minimize potential risks, and intensive monitoring, including early 
safety assessment, is in place for those risks deemed to be most likely based on prior 
experience with the IPs (including MEDI4736, tremelimumab, and SoC).
The toxicity profile of the combination MEDI4736 + tremelimumab includes fatigue, colitis, 
diarrhea, AST or ALT increases, amylase and lipase increases, rash and pruritus, and other 
immune-mediated reactions, which were mostly reversible and manageable by [CONTACT_514261].  
In particular, based on the specific mechanism of action of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab 
leading to T-cell activation and proliferation, there is the possibility of observing immune-
related AEs (irAEs) during the conduct of this study.  Potential irAEs may be similar to those seen with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], BMS-936558, and BMS-936559 and may include immune-
mediated enterocolitis, pneumonitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies 
(Brahmer et al 2012 , Hodi et al 2010 , Topalian et al 2012 ).  Patients should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In the absence of an alternate etiology (eg, infection or PD), an 
immune-related etiology should be considered for signs or symptoms of pneumonitis, 
enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy.  It is recommended that management of irAEs follow the guidelines outlined in Section 6.7.
The rationale for this study is supported by [CONTACT_514262], 
the limited survival benefit provided by [CONTACT_514263], the limited life expectancy due to malignant disease, the activity seen with MEDI4736 in this 
tumor type, and the strength of the scientific hypotheses evaluating the safety and tolerability 
of (1) MEDI4736 monotherapy and (2) MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy treatments in second-line therapy.  Based on these considerations, the proposed treatments
may have the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit by [CONTACT_514264], thereby [CONTACT_275192] (QoL) and potentially extending survival.  Furthermore, preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 
and CTLA-4 targeting agents may provide antitumor activity, with additional synergy from 
the combination ( Wolchok et al 2013 ).  Therefore, the investigation of the potential 
therapeutic efficacy of MEDI4736 monotherapy and the combination of MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab in patients with PD-L1-positive and -negative tumors is acceptable, and the 
overall benefit/risk assessment supports the proposed study design.

38(131)1.4 Study design
This is a second-line Phase II study assessing MEDI4736 monotherapy and
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy.  
This is a Phase II, open-label, multi-center study to determine the efficacy and safety of 
MEDI4736 evaluated as single agent or in combination with tremelimumab in patients with metastatic PDAC whose disease has progressed on a 5-FU-containing or gemcitabine-
containing first-line chemotherapy.  A schematic diagram of the overall study design is shown 
in Figure 1 , and a detailed study flow chart is shown in Figure 2 . Patients will be enrolled
globally.  
Initially, patients will be enrolled in the study and randomized (1:1) to treatment with 
MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab, until [ADDRESS_666399] been randomized to treatment in each arm (Part A: Lead-in).  Randomization will be stratified 
according to best response to prior first-line chemotherapy (CR, PR, or SD) versus no 
response (PD) and according to prior first-line chemotherapy, 5-FU-containing versus gemcitabine-containing.  Patient recruitment and tumor assessment will be monitored on an 
ongoing basis.  
The format of Part B will be determined based on the responses seen in the first 30 patients in 
each arm in Part A. A protocol amendment will be made if criteria are met to proceed to 
Part B. The protocol amendment will include available data from Part A and any changes to 
study design and statistical plan, if needed.
1. Part B: Expansion .  If an ORR of >25% (ie, responses in ≥8 patients) is observed 
in the first 30 treated patients in either treatment arm in Part A (unless the totality of 
the data support a different decision), after protocol amendment an additional 70 patients will be enrolled in that arm, for a total of 100 evaluable patients per arm.  
2. Part B: Randomized, controlled trial (RCT) .  If an ORR of >15% and <25% 
(ie, response in ≥5 patients and <8 patients) is observed in the first 30 treated 
patients in either treatment arm in Part A, a randomized, controlled substudy may
be initiated after protocol amendment.  
If initiated, Part B: RCTwill be an open-label, multi-center, study to determine the efficacy 
and safety of MEDI4736 monotherapy and/or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination 
therapy versus SoC chemotherapy in patients with metastatic PDAC who have failed 5-FU-
containing or gemcitabine-containing first-line chemotherapy.  Approximately 125 additional patients per treatment arm will be planned for enrollment.  Treatment arms for MEDI4736 
monotherapy and/or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab will only be included in the Part B: RCT if 
the corresponding treatment meets the appropriate ORR criteria in Part A.  If initiated, the data from Part B: RCT will be analyzed separately and will not be pooled with Part A for the 
purpose of statistical analysis.

target lesions, unless there are no other lesions suitable for biopsy.  Samples with limited tumor content and fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_122565].  Specimens from 
metastatic bone lesions are typi[INVESTIGATOR_255668] a significant soft tissue 
component.  The tumor specimen should be of sufficient quantity to allow for PD-L1 IHC and other exploratory biomarker analyses and is preferred in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded 
blocks.
At randomization, once the patient is confirmed to be eligible, the Investigator or suitably 
trained delegate will complete a randomization call via the IVRS/IWRS.  Randomization 
numbers will be assigned strictly sequentially by [CONTACT_54537]/IWRS as patients are eligible for entry 
into the study.  The system will randomize the eligible patient to 1 of the 2 or 3 treatment groups (depending on the part of the study).  Rando mization will be stratified according to 
best response to prior first-line chemotherapy (CR, PR, or SD) versus no response (PD) and 
according to prior first-line chemotherapy, 5-FU-containing versus gemcitabine-containing.
If the patient is ineligible and not enrolled/randomized, the IVRS/IWRS should be contact[CONTACT_514268] a screen failure. 
Patients will begin treatment on Day 1.  Patients must not be treated unless all eligibility 
criteria have been met.  
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his or her enrollment code or
randomization code cannot be reused.  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.

51(131)whether to continue or discontinue the patient from treatment.  The [COMPANY_008] study 
physician must ensure all decisions are appropriately documented.
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
At baseline, patients who satisfy all the entry criteria will be centrally assigned to study drug 
by [CONTACT_21926]/IWRS, according to the randomization scheme generated by [CONTACT_514269], [COMPANY_008], or delegate.  The randomization scheme will be produced by a computer 
software program that incorporates a standard procedure for generating randomization 
numbers.  One randomization list will be produced for each of the randomization strata.  A blocked randomization will be generated, and all centers will use the same list in order to 
minimize any imbalance in the number of patients assigned to each treatment group in Part A. 
Patients will be identified to the IVRS/IWRS per country regulations.  Randomization/
enrollment codes will be assigned strictly sequentially, within each stratum, as patients 
become eligible for randomization.  The IVRS/IWRS Centralized Randomization Center will 
inform the pharmacist of the kit identification number to be allocated to the patient at the randomization visit.  
Every effort should be made to minimize the time between randomization/enrollment and 
starting study drug.  It is recommended that patients commence study drug as soon as possible after randomization/enrollment (ie, on the same day after randomization in the IVRS/IWRS 
system).
The Investigator will call/log in to the IVRS/IWRS for each subsequent dispensing visit for 
assignment of a new kit identification number.  The kit identification number dispensed at 
each visit will correspond to the treatment arm to which the patient was originally 
randomized/enrolled. 
If a patient discontinues participation in the study, then their enrollment/randomization code 
cannot be reused. 
3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding
This is an open-label study.
3.7 Methods for unblinding 
This is an open-label study.
3.8 Restrictions
The following restrictions apply while the patient is receiving study treatment and for the specified times before and after:
1. Female patients of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a 
nonsterilized male partner must use [ADDRESS_666430] 2015
52(131)final dose of IP; cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a 
responsible physician.  Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal 
method are not acceptable methods of birth control.
#Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically 
sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete 
hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses 
without an alternative medical cause).
#Female patients must use 2 acceptable methods of effective contraception as 
described in Table 1 .
#It is strongly recommended for the male partner of a female patient to also use 
male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. 
#Female patients must refrain from egg cell donation and breastfeeding while on 
study and for [ADDRESS_666431] refrain from sperm donation for 180 days after the final dose of study drug.  
3. All patients: Patients should not donate blood while participating in this study and 
for [ADDRESS_666432] dose of study treatment.

An individual patient will not receive any further IP if any of the following occur in the 
patient in question:
1. Withdrawal of consent from further treatment with IP

Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666435] 2015
53(131)2. Lost to follow-up
3. An AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37447], contraindicates 
further dosing
4. Any AE that meets criteria for discontinuation as defined in Section [ADDRESS_666436] met 1 or more of the exclusion criteria or failed to 
meet all of the inclusion criteria for study participation at study entry and continuing IP dosing might constitute a safety risk
6. Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant
7. Patient noncompliance that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12182], warrants 
withdrawal from study medication (eg, refusal to adhere to scheduled visits)
8. Initiation of alternative anticancer therapy, including another investigational agent
9. Confirmed PD and Investigator determination that the patient is no longer 
benefiting from treatment with IP. Patients enrolled in the SOC arm will 
discontinue study drug at the first assessment of disease progression.
3.9.[ADDRESS_666437] 
At any time, patients are free to discontinue the IP without prejudice to further treatment.  A 
patient who decides to discontinue the IP will always be asked about the reason(s) for 
withdrawal and the presence of any AEs.  If possible, they will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_114013].  AEs will be followed up (see Section 6).  All study drugs provided to the 
patients should be returned by [CONTACT_102].  The [COMPANY_008] Study Physician should be 
notified of any ongoing AE that may delay treatment or necessitate permanent discontinuation 
of treatment.
Patients who are permanently discontinued from further receipt of IP, regardless of the reason, 
will be identified as having permanently discontinued treatment.  Patients who are 
permanently discontinued will enter follow-up (see Table 3 and Table 4 ).  All patients will be 
followed up for survival until the end of the study.  Patients who decline to return to the site 
for follow-up evaluations (see Table 3 and Table 4 ) should be contact[CONTACT_80077] [ADDRESS_666438] the reason for study 
withdrawal recorded as “eligibility criteria not fulfilled” (ie, patient does not meet the required

54(131)inclusion/exclusion criteria).  This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for screen failures 
(ie, not randomized patients).  Patients can be rescreened a single time, but they cannot be 
re-randomized. Patients being rescreened should be assigned with a new enrollment code.
3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (IP and assessments), without 
prejudice to further treatment.
Patients who withdraw consent for further participation in the study will not receive any 
further IP or further study observation, with the exception of follow-up for survival, which 
will continue until the end of the study unless the patient has expressly withdrawn his or her 
consent to survival follow-up.  Note that the patient may be offered additional tests or tapering of treatment to withdraw safely.
A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AE.  The Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study until resolution. The patient will return electronic PRO devices, if applicable.  
Patients will be considered lost to follow-up only if no contact [CONTACT_497120] (see Section 3.11), such that there is insufficient information to 
determine the patient’s status at that time.  Patients who refuse continuing participation in the 
study, including telephone contact, should be documented as “withdrawal of consent” rather 
than “lost to follow-up.”  Investigators should document attempts to re-establish contact [CONTACT_514270].  If contact [CONTACT_4490] a missing patient is 
re-established, the patient should not be considered lost to follow-up and any evaluations 
should resume according to the protocol.  
Patients who decline to return to the site for follow-up evaluations (see Table 3 and Table 4 ) 
should be contact[CONTACT_80077] 2 months as an alternative.  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.  When a patient is withdrawn from the study, study center personnel should call the IVRS/IWRS and register the patient withdrawal information.
3.11 Discontinuation of the study
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of [COMPANY_008], trial patients are placed at 
undue risk because of clinically significant findings that meet any of the following criteria:
! Meet individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_103414] 
! Are assessed as causally related to study drug, 
! Are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study
In addition, the study may be stopped if the criteria to proceed are not met (see Section 8.2). 
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patients at the time of 
discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the eCRFs. All reasons for discontinuation of treatment must be documented.

55(131)In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the patients’ interests.  If this study is discontinued, all other studies involving 
MEDI4736 or tremelimumab will remain open to enrollment and screening, if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1034].

jOn Day 1 and Week 12, PK samples will be collected pre-dose (within 60 minutes prior to treatment with any IP) and at the end of in fusion (within 10 minutes of end of 
infusion of MEDI4736 and within 10 minutes of end of infusion of tremelimumab [for patients receiving MEDI4736 + tremelimumab]).  On Week 4, PK samples will be 
collected pre-dose (within 60 minutes prior to treatment with any IP) only. On Week 24, PK samples will be collected pre-dose (with in 60 minutes prior to treatment 
with any IP) and at the end-of-infusion for MEDI4736 (within 10 minutes of end of infusion), with no sample for tremelimumab.
kThe follow-up samples (3 and 6 months) for each molecule are relative to the respective last dose.
lPatients in the MEDI4736 monotherapy arm will receive MEDI4736 every 4 weeks for up to 12 months (up to 13 doses). Patients in the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy arm will receive MEDI4736 and tremelimumab every [ADDRESS_666449] 4 months (up to 4 doses) followed by  [CONTACT_46054]4736 every 4 weeks for the 
subsequent 8 months (up to 9 doses). For the combination arm only – tremelimumab will be administered first; the MEDI4736 infusi on will start approximately [ADDRESS_666450] cycle, and at the d iscretion of the physician, then for all other 
cycles MEDI4736 can be given immediately after the tremelimumab infusion has finished.  Patients who achieve and maintain disea se control (ie, CR, PR, or SD) 
through to the end of the assigned IP 12-month treatment period may restart treatment with the combination upon evidence of PD,  with or without confirmation, during 
follow-up.  Before restarting their assigned IP, the Investigator should ensure patients do not have any significant, unaccepta ble, or irreversible toxicities that indicate 
continuing treatment will not further benefit the patient, and that the patient still fulfills the eligibility criteria for thi s study, including re-consenting to restart IP.  To 
restart treatment, the patient must not have received an intervening systemic anticancer therapy after his or her assigned IP di scontinuation.  Patients should have a 
baseline tumor assessment within 28 days of restarting their assigned IP treatment; all further scans should occur q6w ±7 days (re lative to the date of restarting treatment)
and q12w ±7 days thereafter until study treatment is stopped (maximum of 12 months of further treatment).  If a patient derives cl inical benefit from the combination of 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab, per judgment of the Investigator, and subsequently progresses while undergoing treatment with MEDI4736  alone, MEDI4736 q4w and 
tremelimumab induction may be reinstituted for 4 doses 1 time only (follow the same treatment guidelines as during the first 12  months).
mPROs (EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-PAN26, and EQ-5D-5L) will be collected during Part B only.  Patients will complete PROs using handheld ele ctronic devices at study 
sites if assessment timepoint coincides with a study visit; otherwise patients will complete the PROs at home.  PROs should be completed prior to any other visit 
procedures to ensure that any such clinical interactions do not bias the patient’s response to the questionnaire items.  Please note that the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC 
QLQ-PAN26 are administered as a single questionnaire.

Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666467] 2015
65(131)4.1 Enrollment/screening period
At screening, consenting patients are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibility criteria. 
Patients who do not meet these criteria must not be enrolled in the study.  All screening and 
enrollment procedures will be performed according to the assessment schedules in Table [ADDRESS_666468] 
be obtained prior to performing any protocol-specific procedures, including screening/baseline 
evaluations.  All patients will be required to provide consent to supply a sample of their tumor 
(archival or newly acquired biopsy) for entry into this study.  This consent is included in the 
main patient informed consent form (ICF).
Screening/baseline evaluations may be performed over more than 1 visit.
The timing of ECGs and vital sign assessments should be such that it allows the blood draw 
(eg, PK blood sample) to occur at the timepoints indicated in Table 2 through Table 4 .
4.2 Treatment period
All procedures to be conducted during the 12-month treatment period will be performed 
according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2 ). 
Whenever vital signs, ECGs, and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal time, the 
assessments should occur in the following order: ECG, vital signs, and then blood draws.  The 
timing of the first 2 assessments should be such that it allows the blood draw (eg, PK blood sample) to occur at the timepoints indicated in Table 2 through Table 4 .
4.3 Follow-up period
All procedures to be conducted during the follow-up period will be performed according to 
the assessment schedule (see Table 3 and Table 4 ).
Whenever vital signs, ECGs, and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal time, the 
assessments should occur in the following order: ECG, vital signs, and then blood draws.  The 
timing of the first 2 assessments should be such that it allows the blood draw (eg, PK blood 
sample) to occur at the exact nominal time.
5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS
A Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and query 
handling.  The Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs as specified in the 
study protocol and in accordance with the instructions provided.
The Investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and 
of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA). 
The Investigator will sign the completed eCRFs.  A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site.
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666469] 2015
66(131)The Investigator will record data on the observations, tests, and assessments specified in the 
protocol on the eCRFs provided by [CONTACT_38227]. The CRF will be accompanied with 
“Instructions for the Investigator,” which should be followed. These instructions provide guidance for the recording of study data in the eCRF, including how to change data 
incorrectly recorded.
5.[ADDRESS_666470] 1.1 guidelines for measurable, nonmeasurable, target, and non-target lesions and the objective tumor response criteria (CR, 
PR, SD, or PD) are presented in Appendix F .  OS, OS6, and OS12 will also be evaluated.
The methods of assessment of tumor burden used at baseline are CT and/or MRI scans of the 
chest and abdomen; scans of the pelvis should only be done when there is suspected or 
documented disease involvement.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be 
additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual patients.
The baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before start of study 
treatment, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment.  
Efficacy for all patients will be assessed by [CONTACT_514276] 6 weeks (q6w ±7 days) for the first [ADDRESS_666471] infusion, and q12w ±7 
days thereafter until confirmed objective disease progression.  If an unscheduled assessment is 
performed and the patient has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at his or her scheduled visits.
A confirmatory scan is required following the initial demonstration of PD.  The confirmatory 
scan should occur preferably at the next scheduled visit and no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of PD in the absence of clinically significant deterioration.  Treatment will 
continue between the initial assessment of progression and confirmation for progression.
If a patient discontinues treatment (and/or receives a subsequent anticancer therapy) prior to 
progression, then the patient should still continue to be followed until confirmed objective 
disease progression.
Categorization of objective tumor response assessment will be based on the RECIST 1.1 
criteria of response: CR, PR, SD, and PD.  Target lesion progression will be calculated in 
comparison to when the tumor burden was at a minimum (ie, smallest sum of diameters 
previously recorded on study).  In the absence of progression, tumor response (CR or PR) and SD will be calculated in comparison to the baseline tumor measurements obtained before 
starting treatment.
Objective tumor response (CR or PR) should be confirmed preferably at the next scheduled 
visit and not less than [ADDRESS_666472] 2015
67(131)Following confirmed progression, patients should continue to be followed up for survival 
every 2 months (8 weeks) as outlined in the follow-up schedule of assessments ( Table 4 ).  In 
addition, all patients will be contact[CONTACT_514277].
Patients randomized to the MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab arms who 
achieve and maintain disease control (ie, CR, PR, or SD) through to the end of the 12-month treatment period may restart treatment with their assigned IP upon evidence of PD, with or 
without confirmation, according to RECIST 1.1, during follow-up (patients receiving 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab in combination may restart combination therapy following disease control lasting at least the first 4 cycles of combination therapy).  To restart treatment, 
the patient must not have received an intervening systemic anticancer therapy post 
discontinuation.  Patients who restart treatment must have a baseline tumor assessment within 28 days of restarting treatment with IP; all further scans should occur q6w ±7 days (relative to 
the date of restarting treatment) and then q12w ±7 days thereafter until confirmed disease 
progression. All assessments in Table 2 will be followed for patients who continue to receive 
treatment. 
It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible.  Refer to the study 
plans ( Table 2 [screening and the treatment period], Table 3 and Table 4 [follow up]) and 
Appendix F .
5.1.1 Central reading of scans
Investigator’s assessment of all scans using RECIST 1.1 will be conducted (see Section 8.5
for the analysis methods).  All images will be collected and stored with the imaging providerfor possible future central re-analysis at the discretion of the Sponsor.  Guidelines for image
collection, quality control, and storage will be provided in a separate document.  The 
management of patients will be based solely upon the results of assessment conducted by [CONTACT_737].  When a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) is performed, three levels 
of review will be included in the radiology assessments: RECIST 1.1, RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_666473] 1.1.
5.2 Safety assessments
5.2.1 Laboratory safety assessments
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
will be taken at the times indicated in the assessment schedules and as clinically indicated (see
Table 2 through Table 4 ).
Clinical laboratory safety tests, including serum pregnancy tests, will be performed in a 
licensed clinical laboratory according to local standard procedures.  Sample tubes and sample 
sizes may vary depending on the laboratory method used and routine practice at the site.  
Urine pregnancy tests may be performed at the site using a licensed test (urine or serum pregnancy test).  Abnormal clinically significant laboratory results should be repeated as soon 
as possible (preferably within 24 to 48 hours).

If a patient shows an AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN, refer to 
Appendix E f or further instructions.  These cases should be reported as SAEs if, after 
evaluation, they meet the criteria for a Hy’s Law case or if any of the individual liver test 
parameters fulfill any of the SAE criteria.  All patients with an elevated AST, ALT, or bilirubin value (the latter at ≥1.5 × ULN) at the time of the last dose of study treatment should 
have a further liver chemistry profile (AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) 
performed 30 days (±3 days) after permanent discontinuation of study treatment.  Results for safety blood assessments must be available and reviewed before commencing an infusion.
Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory values should be repeated as clinically 
indicated and recorded on the eCRF.  Situations in which laboratory safety results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 6.3.[ADDRESS_666476] returned to Grade 1 or 2, unless these values are not likely to improve because of the 
underlying disease.
5.2.2 Physical examination
Physical examinations will be performed according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2
through Table 4 ).  Targeted physical examinations are to be utilized by [CONTACT_514278].  All physical examinations will include 
body weight measurement.  Situations in which physical examination results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 6.3.7 .
5.2.3 ECG
Resting 12-lead ECGs will be recorded according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2 ).  
ECGs should be obtained after the patient has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] 5 minutes and should be recorded while the patient remains in that position.
ECGs will be recorded at screening and as clinically indicated.
Abnormal ECGs and the ECG obtained at screening will require triplicate results. In case of 
clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including a QTcF value >[ADDRESS_666477] 2015
70(131)12-lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (eg, 30 minutes) to confirm 
prolongation.  
Situations in which ECG results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 6.3.7 .
5.2.4 Vital signs
Vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]) will be evaluated 
according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2 through Table 4 ).  
On infusion days, patients will be monitored during and after infusion of IP as presented in the 
bulleted list below.  
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_514219] [ADDRESS_666478]-infusion observation period: 30 and 60 minutes after the

5.2.5 Other safety assessments
Pregnancy tests on either urine (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) or blood (serum 
beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [ β-hCG]) samples will be performed for premenopausal 
women of childbearing potential at the times specified in the assessment schedule (see Table 2
through Table 4 ).  Tests will be performed by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s local laboratory.  If results are 
positive, the patient is ineligible and must be discontinued from treatment.  In the event of a suspected pregnancy during the study, the test should be repeated.
Other safety tests to be performed at screening include assessment for hepatitis B surface 
antigen, hepatitis C antibodies, HIV antibodies, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine.

71(131)5.3 Other assessments
5.3.1 Patient reported outcomes (PRO)
“PRO” is an umbrella term referring to all outcomes and symptoms that are directly reported 
by [CONTACT_102].  PROs have become a significant endpoint when evaluating effectiveness of 
treatments in clinical studies.  The following PROs will be administered in this study: EORTC 
QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-PAN26, the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), and the EQ-5D-5L; see 
Appendix G ).
The PRO instruments will be self-administered by [CONTACT_514279].  All assessments should be completed without assistance 
from site staff according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2 , Table 3 , and Table 4 ), 
before any other study procedures are conducted at a given visit.  Study coordinators should ensure that patients have completed the PRO assessment for that visit before the patient is 
seen by a study nurse or physician (unless these are the same person).  It takes approximately 
15 to 30 minutes for patients to complete the questionnaires; therefore, the burden to the patient is moderate.  If patients have had scans at an outside facility or missed a scheduled 
data collection site visit, PRO questionnaires should still be completed by [CONTACT_514280].  
[IP_ADDRESS] EORTC QLQ-C30
The EORTC QLQ-C30, Version 3 questionnaire is included for the purpose of assessing 
HRQoL and is a well-established measure of HRQoL/health status, and commonly used as an 
endpoint in cancer clinical trials.  It assesses HRQoL/health status through 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales 
(fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), and a global health and QoL scale.  Six single-item 
symptom measures are also included: dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties (see Appendix G).  For each of the 15 domains, final scores are 
transformed such that they range from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate greater 
functioning, greater HRQoL, or greater level of symptoms ( Aaronson et al 1993 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] EORTC QLQ-PAN26
For patients with pancreatic cancer, a disease-specific self-administered questionnaire for 
pancreatic cancer was developed (EORTC QLQ-PAN26; Appendix G) to be used in 
conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 ( Fitzsimmons and Johnson 1998 , 
Fitzsimmons et al 2005 ).  The EORTC QLQ-PAN26 consists of 26 items that comprise 
7 multi-item scales (pancreatic pain [4 items], eating related [2 items], hepatic [2 items], 
altered bowel habit [2 items], body image [2 items], health care satisfaction [2 items], and sexuality [2 items]) and 10 single-item scales (swollen abdomen, taste changes, indigestion, 
flatulence, weight loss, loss of muscle strength, dry mouth, burden of treatment, fear of future 
health, and ability to plan future).  When items are grouped into domains rather than reporting specific items, it is important that the correct scoring algorithm is followed.  Higher scores 
represent more symptoms, except for health care satisfaction scale and sexuality scale where 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666481] 2015
72(131)higher scores represent greater satisfaction and sexuality. For change scores, a score of +5 is 
considered deterioration (except for the 2 scales mentioned above) and a score of -5 is 
considered as improvement.  Thus, final scores are transformed such that they range from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate greater functioning or greater level of symptoms ( Aaronson 
et al 1993 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] PRO-CTCAE
The PRO-CTCAE is included to address tolerability from the patients’ perspective.  It was 
developed by [CONTACT_6812].  The PRO-CTCAE will only be administered in those countries where 
a linguistically validated version exists.  It was developed in recognition that collecting 
symptom data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symptomatic AE data collection.  This was based on findings from multiple studies 
demonstrating that physicians and nurses underestimate symptom onset, frequency, and 
severity in comparison with patient ratings ( Basch et al 2009 , Litwin et al 1998 , Sprangers and 
Aaronson 1992 ).  These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (eg, CTCAE term 
“myalgia” converted to “aching muscles”).  For several symptoms, like fatigue and pain, 
additional questions are asked about symptom frequency, severity, and interference with usual activities.  The items included in the PRO CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative 
review among experts and patients.  These items have been extensively evaluated by [CONTACT_514281], comprehensible, and measuring the symptom of interest.  In this study, only items that are considered relevant for the trial, site of cancer, and cancer treatment are 
selected (see Appendix G ).
[IP_ADDRESS] EQ-5D-5L
The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status developed by [CONTACT_159872] a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal 
(EuroQol Group 1990 ).  Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it 
provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys.  
The questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety/depression.  Each dimension has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems) that reflect increasing 
levels of difficulty ( EuroQol Group 2013 ).
Since 2009, the EuroQol group has been developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a more sensitive version of the EQ-5D 
(the EQ-5D-5L) which expands the range of responses to each dimension from 3 to 5 levels of 
increasing severity ( Herdman et al 2011 ).  Preliminary studies indicate that the 5L version 
improves upon the properties of the 3L measure in terms of reduced ceiling effect, increased reliability and an improved ability to differentiate between different levels of health ( Janssen 
et al 2008a , Janssen et al 2008b , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_149983] 2007 ).
The patient will be asked to indicate his/her current health state by [CONTACT_406822] [ADDRESS_666482] imaginable health state (see Appendix G).

73(131)5.3.2 Administration of the patient-reported outcome questionnaires
Patients will complete the PRO assessments by [CONTACT_2329] a handheld electronic device (ePRO).
Each center must allocate the responsibility for the administration of the PRO instruments to a 
specific individual (eg, a research nurse or study coordinator) and, if possible, assign a back-up person to cover if that individual is absent.  The PRO questionnaires must be 
administered and completed at the clinic as per the schedule of assessments if the assessment 
timepoint coincides with a study visit; otherwise patients will complete the PROs at home.  The PRO questionnaires will be administered on the days specified in the schedules of 
assessments (see Table 2 , Table 3 , and Table 4 ).  Post-progression, patients should complete 
PROs at home if necessary to minimize noncompliance.
The following best practice guidelines should be followed when collecting PRO data via an 
electronic device:
! PRO questionnaires must be completed prior to any other study procedures 
(following informed consent) and before discussion of disease progression to avoid 
bias in the patient’s responses to the questions.
! PRO questionnaires must be completed by [CONTACT_424633].
! The research nurse or appointed site staff must explain to patients the value and 
relevance of study participation and inform them that these questions are being 
asked to find out, directly from them, how they feel.  The research nurse or 
appointed site staff should also stress that the information is confidential.  
Therefore, if the patients have any medical problems, they should discuss them with the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment.
! The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the patient on how to use the 
ePRO device, using the materials and training provided by [CONTACT_70170], and 
provide guidance on whom to call if there are problems with the device.
! The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind patients that there are no 
right or wrong answers and avoid introducing bias by [CONTACT_72985].
! The patient should not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to answer 
the PRO questionnaires.  If a patient uses visual aids (eg, spectacles or contact [CONTACT_13276]) for reading and does not have them when he or she attends the clinic, the 
patient will be exempted from completing the PROs.  
! Site staff must not read or complete the PRO questionnaires on behalf of the patient.  
If the patient is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind or illiterate), that 
patient should be exempted from completing PRO questionnaires but may still 
participate in the study.  Patients exempted in this regard should be flagged 
appropriately by [CONTACT_7893]. 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666484] 2015
74(131)! The patient should be given sufficient time to complete the PRO questionnaires at 
his or her own speed.
! The research nurse or appointed site staff or family member must monitor 
compliance; minimizing missing data is a key aspect of study success.  Compliance must be checked at each study visit and should be checked more frequently to 
identify problems early. If compliance drops below 85%, a check-in call from the site to ask the patient if he or she has any difficulties is highly recommended.
5.3.3 ECOG performance status
ECOG performance status will be assessed at the times specified in the assessment schedules 
(see Table 2 through Table 4 ) based on the following:
0=Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction
1=Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out 
work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work
2=Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work 
activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours
3=Capable of only limited selfcare, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of 
waking hours
4=Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any selfcare. Totally confined to bed or 
chair
5=Dead
Any significant changes from baseline or screening must be reported as an AE.
5.3.4 Health resource use
For the purposes of economic evaluation for payer submissions, it is necessary to capture 
healthcare resource use related to the treatment and the underlying disease.  Within the study, the following will be captured:
! Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514220] (HOSPAD).  HOSPAD 
is an eCRF module completed by [CONTACT_514282]’s medical 
records regarding the type of contact (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], outpatient, day case), reason, and length of stay by [CONTACT_514283] (including intensive care unit).
! Treatment related to AEs (including the method of delivery of the treatment) 
captured in AE/SAE assessment module
! Treatment not related to the study captured in concomitant medications eCRF

will be obtained according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2 through Table 4 ).
Details on sample processing, handling, shipment, and storage are provided in the Laboratory 
Manual.
5.4.[ADDRESS_666486] samples.  The results from the evaluation will not be reported in the CSR, but will be reported separately in a bioanalytical validation report.
Any residual back up PK samples may be used for future exploratory biomarker research (in 
this case, residual back-up PK samples will be shipped to [COMPANY_008] Biobank; see details in the Laboratory Manual).
5.4.4 Collection of samples to measure the presence of ADAs
The presence of ADAs will be assessed in serum samples taken according to the assessment 
schedules (see Table 2 through Table 4 ). 
Samples will be measured for the presence of ADAs and ADA-neutralizing antibodies for 
MEDI4736 and tremelimumab using validated assays.  Tiered analysis will be performed to 
include screening, confirmatory, and titer assay components, and positive-negative cut points previously statistically determined from drug-naive validation samples will be used. 
5.4.[ADDRESS_666487] 2015
76(131)ADA samples may be disposed of or destroyed and anonymized by [CONTACT_76435]. Additional 
analyses may be conducted on the anonymized, pooled samples to further evaluate and 
validate the analytical method.  Results from such analyses may be reported separately from the CSR.
Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, will be performed alongside the bioanalysis 
of the test samples.  The results from the evaluation will not be reported in the CSR but will be reported separately in a bioanalytical validation report.
Any residual back-up ADA samples may be used for future exploratory biomarker research 
(in this case, residual back-up PK samples will be shipped to [COMPANY_008] Biobank; see details in the Laboratory Manual).
5.5 Biomarker analysis 
The patient’s consent to the use of donated biological samples is mandatory.  
Mandatory tumor and blood biomarkers to be evaluated for the purpose of evaluation of 
patient selection and for exploratory analyses are described in Section 5.5.1 .  Exploratory 
biomarkers may be evaluated as determined by [CONTACT_91010] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Samples 
will be taken according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2 through Table 4 ).
Biomarkers that have demonstrated the potential to identify patients who are likely to respond 
to treatment with IP (from other MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy studies) may be investigated to determine a patient’s biomarker status 
and for possible correlation with efficacy endpoints in an exploratory analysis outside the scope of the CSR.  
Exploratory biomarker research will not form part of the CSR.  The results may be pooled 
with biomarker data from other MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 combination therapy studies to test existing hypotheses or to generate hypotheses to be tested in future studies.
5.5.1 Collection of samples
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of biomarker samples for evaluation of patient selectionProvisions of tissue are as follows:
! MANDATORY: Provision of a tumor biopsy, formalin-fixed and embedded in 
paraffin, for the purpose of PD-L1 expression analyses and for enabling exploratory 
analyses as described in the proceeding section.  A newly acquired tumor biopsy is 
strongly preferred; however, if not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk, an 
archival sample taken <[ADDRESS_666488] be received by [CONTACT_514273].
Samples should be collected via an image-guided core needle (at least 18 gauge) or 
an excisional archival tumor biopsy sample. Where institutional practice in this

77(131)setting uses a smaller gauge needle, samples should be submitted in sufficient 
number to ensure that a valid result can be achieved.
When tissue is acquired for this study, effort should be made to maximize material 
for downstream analyses. Two cores, using an 18-gauge or larger needle, are 
required for determining PD-L1 expression levels.  These should be placed in 
formalin and processed to a single paraffin embedded block, as described in the Pathology Manual.  When a smaller gauge needle is used, the number of cores rises 
to 3 or 4. That written, and as a guidance, it is anticipated that 4 passes of a core 
needle will provide sufficient tissue. Whenever feasible, additional cores should be obtained and immediately frozen as described in the Laboratory Manual.
Tumor lesions planned for biopsy should not be used as index lesions for 
assessment of disease.
! MANDATORY: If clinically feasible, on-treatment collection of tumor biopsies at 
the timepoints indicated in Table [ADDRESS_666490] consult with the Study 
Physician if such sampling is not feasible.
! OPTIONAL: If a newly acquired tumor sample is submitted during screening, an 
additional archived tumor tissue block (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) is 
strongly encouraged, where such samples exist in a quantity sufficient to allow for analysis. 
! The collection of tumor biopsies at the time of progression and prior to retreatment 
is strongly encouraged.  The biopsy procedure at retreatment should be omitted only 
if there is unacceptable clinical risk or the procedure is otherwise considered not 
feasible.  The Investigator must consult with the Study Physician prior to making the decision not to biopsy at retreatment.
Additional tumor biopsies collected as part of clinical care (eg, for mixed responses or upon 
PD) can be submitted for further analysis.
See the Laboratory Manual for further details of requirements.
Tumor biopsies will be stored at [COMPANY_008] Research and Development or an appropriate 
vendor selected by [CONTACT_38227].  Core biopsies may be used for correlative studies such as IHC assay, tumor mutation analysis, ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, proteomic analysis, 
immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and assessment of immunodiversity.  A brief outline of such analyses is 
provided in the exploratory biomarker data description in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Samples will be 
collected, labeled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory biomarker data
Blood and tumor samples for exploratory biomarker analyses will be obtained according to the 
assessment schedules presented in Table [ADDRESS_666491] 2015
78(131)Pharmacodynamic changes in biomarker measures will be monitored, when applicable.  
Baseline measures (and early, on-treatment changes) will be correlated with outcomes.  Note 
that samples will be obtained from patients enrolled to each treatment arm.  Data will be compared across treatment arms to determine if changes are specific to one treatment arm 
versus the other.  Similar comparisons will be made with baseline measures to determine if 
biomarkers (or combination of markers) are prognostic or may be candidate, predictive markers of outcomes associated with MEDI4736 monotherapy and MEDI4736 combination 
therapy.  
All samples collected for such exploratory analyses will be stored at the site, a reference 
laboratory, or at Sponsor’s facilities and may be used for subsequent research relevant to 
evaluating response to immunotherapy.
The exploratory biomarker plan is described by [CONTACT_514284].Tumor markers (in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue)
Tissue obtained as part of screening procedures and for establishing PD-L1 expression will be 
analyzed for additional markers by [CONTACT_76950].  At a minimum, CD8 and CD4/FoxP3 
measures will be completed in an effort to enumerate cytotoxic versus regulatory T cells.  Based on availability of tissue, a panel of additional, immune-relevant markers expressed on 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or on tumor cells may be assessed.  Markers of special interest 
include, but are not limited to, Ox40, GITR, PD-L2, Tim-3, CD137, Lag-3, and markers that may identify MDSCs, which may change on treatment ( Highfill et al 2014 ).
Tissues obtained at screening may be assessed also for somatic mutations and/or for an
interferon-gamma (IFN- γ) gene expression signature (eg, IFN- γ) by [CONTACT_514285] (RT-qPCR), in situ hybridization, NanoString
®, and/or 
similar methodologies. 
Whole blood for DNA/single nucleotide polymorphism genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_514221].  
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_514222]-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, and human 
leukocyte antigen loci may be completed to determine whether natural variation within such 
genes is associated with likelihood of clinical benefit and/or with likelihood of drug-related AEs.  Genes associated with solid tumor development, disease progression, or likelihood of 
tumor response to chemotherapy may, likewise, be investigated.  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_514223], data will not be shared with patients, and results will not impact treatment decisions.
Genotypes may also be correlated with biomarker measures (eg, gene and/or protein 
expression) obtained from other sample types described in this exploratory biomarker section.  A primary hypothesis is that different genotypes will be associated with different expression 
levels of factors within the PD-[ADDRESS_666492] the ability of a patient to mount an appropriate immune reaction to a tumor and/or affect the likelihood of response to therapeutics targeting these pathways.

79(131)Therefore, genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_514224]-to-measure baseline information regarding a 
patient’s immune system.  One goal of this research is to understand how such genetic 
information may be used to predict pharmacodynamic responses to therapy.
Whole blood gene expression (PaxGene-RNA)
Whole blood samples will be obtained before or after treatment as outlined in Table 2 through
Table 4 from all patients.  Total RNA will be prepared for quantification of RNA and/or 
miRNA expression using RT-qPCR, microarray, sequencing, or similar methodology. 
Focus is likely to be given to the expression of immunomodulatory genes previously found to 
be up-regulated in response to MEDI4736 and/or tremelimumab.  Pretreatment expression of 
such genes may indicate active immune responses that may be augmented by [CONTACT_255734][INVESTIGATOR_014]; correlations with outcome data will be completed on select 
candidate predictive markers with the aim of characterizing useful expression thresholds for 
identifying patients likely to receive benefit.  Similar procedures may be completed using select peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples described below.
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells
Flow cytometry will be completed on all patients to quantify pretreatment circulating MDSC 
subtypes.  Different MDSC count thresholds will be analyzed for their ability to predict clinical benefit from therapy.  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
Whole blood samples will be collected for preparation of PBMCs and storage for potential 
downstream analyses.  A variety of assays may be pursued, including immune cell composition/activation status analyses by [CONTACT_4133], MDSC assessments in banked 
specimens, T-cell functional assays (eg, ELISPOT ), receptor occupancy analyses to measure 
target engagement, tetramer analyses to monitor antigen-specific T cells, RNA/miRNA expression, and/or the assessment of the diversity and clonality of T-cell receptor gene 
rearrangements using DNA.  
Soluble factors (plasma)
Plasma will be obtained before or after treatment as outlined in Table 2 through Table 4 .  The 
concentrations of a panel of cytokines and chemokines will be assessed.  Focus is likely to be 
given to factors involved in Th1-driven immune responses, including IFN- γ and interleukin 
(IL)-18.  High pretreatment expressions (concentrations) of such factors may indicate active immune responses that may be augmented by [CONTACT_255734][INVESTIGATOR_014]; 
correlations with outcome data will be completed on select candidate predictive markers, with 
an aim of characterizing useful expression thresholds for identifying patients likely to receive benefit or, alternatively, for identifying patients likely to suffer drug-related AEs. 
Similarly, the concentrations of a battery of immune cell ligands or receptors may be assessed.  
Proteins of special interest include CTLA4, PD-1, PD-L1, B7-1, B7-2, and IL6R.

80(131)Plasma may also be used for the detection/quantification of autoantibodies (against tumor-
associated antigens) on ProtoArray®or a similar assay platform containing antigens 
preselected based on documented expression in study indications.  Seroconversion following treatment will be used as an indicator of overcoming tolerance.  Pretreatment seropositivity 
against specific antigens may provide predictive value, particularly when combined with data 
regarding the presence of antigen-specific T cells ( Yuan et al 2011 ).  Therefore, select 
candidate autoantibody measures may be evaluated for associations with clinical benefit and 
for directing PBMC-based, antigen-directed measures as described for PBMCs above.

5.5.3 Storage, re-use, and destruction of biological samples
Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years from the end of study, after which they will 
be destroyed.  Summaries and analyses for exploratory biomarkers will be documented in a 
separate analysis plan and will be reported outside the CSR in a separate report.  The results of 
this biomarker research may be pooled with biomarker data from other studies involving MEDI4736 or tremelimumab to generate hypotheses to be tested in future research.
5.5.4 Labeling and shipment of biological samples
The Principal Investigator (PI) will ensure that samples are labeled and shipped in accordance 
with the Laboratory Manual and the Biological Substance, Category B, Regulations (materials containing or suspected to contain infectious substances that do not meet Category A criteria); 
see Appendix C.
Any samples identified as infectious materials in Category A will not be shipped, and no 
further samples will be taken from the involved patients unless agreed upon with [COMPANY_008] 
and appropriate labeling, shipment, and containment provisions are approved.

Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666498] 2015
82(131)6.[ADDRESS_666499].  An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laboratory findings, ECG).  In clinical studies, an AE 
can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or 
washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
The term AE is used to include both serious and nonserious AEs.
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, and washout, 
follow-up), that fulfills 1 or more of the following criteria:
! Results in death
! Is immediately life-threatening
! Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
! Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions
! Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
! Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix B .
6.[ADDRESS_666500] study treatment.
6.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events
During the course of the study, all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed up for each 
patient.  Every effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all events, even if the events continue after discontinuation or study completion.
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visit in the study are followed up 
by [CONTACT_96770], but without further recording in the eCRF.  [COMPANY_008] retains the right to request additional

83(131)information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if 
judged to be necessary.
6.3.3 Variables 
! AE (verbatim)
! The date when the AE started and stopped
! The maximum CTCAE grade reported
! Changes in CTCAE grade
! Whether the AE is serious or not
! Investigator causality rating against the IPs (yes or no)
! Action taken with regard to IPs
! Administration of treatment for the AE
! Whether the AE caused the patient’s withdrawal from the study (yes or no)
! Outcome
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:
! Date the AE met criteria for SAE
! Date the Investigator became aware of the SAE
! Seriousness criteria fulfilled
! Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
! Date of discharge
! Probable cause of death
! Date of death
! Whether an autopsy was performed
! Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s)
! Causality assessment in relation to Other Medication
! Description of the AE

Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666502] 2015
84(131)The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, will be utilized for all 
events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, 
the recommendation in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate, and severe events into CTCAE grades should be used.  A copy of CTCAE, Version 4.03 can be downloaded 
from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website (http://ctep.cancer.gov).
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between the IP and each AE and answer “yes”
or “no” to the question, “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?”
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as “yes.”
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix B .
6.3.5 Relationship to protocol procedures
The Investigator is also required to provide an assessment of the relationship of SAEs to 
protocol procedures on the SAE report form.  This includes both non-treatment–emergent (ie, SAEs that occur prior to the administration of IP) and treatment-emergent SAEs.  A 
protocol-related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required during the 
study (eg, blood collection).  The following guidelines should be used by [CONTACT_514286]:
! Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure or intervention that was 
described in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the 
patient’s medical record.
! Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other than the procedure or 
intervention that was described in the protocol.  The alternative etiology must be 
documented in the study patient’s medical record.
6.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_286016]: “Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?” or revealed by [CONTACT_178557]. 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666503] 2015
85(131)When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or 
symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
6.3.7 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the 
CSR.  Deterioration, as compared to baseline, in protocol-mandated laboratory values andvital signs should, therefore, only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or 
if they are considered the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IPs.
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE, and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting Investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in nonmandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deterioration of a laboratory value that is unequivocally due to disease progression should not 
be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical 
examination, as compared with the baseline assessment, will be reported as an AE.
6.3.8 Hy’s Law
Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN may need 
to be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix E for further instruction on cases of 
increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.
6.3.9 Disease progression
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the IP is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of, existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study.

! Death clearly resulting from disease progression should be reported to the Study 
Physician at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the eCRF.  It 
should not be reported as an SAE.
! Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease under 
study, the AE causing the death must be reported to the Study Physician as an SAE 
within 24 hours.  The report should contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of PD, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory 
causes of death.
! Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE.  A 
post-mortem may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if 
performed, a copy of the post-mortem results should be forwarded to [COMPANY_008] Drug Safety or its representative within the usual timeframes.
6.[ADDRESS_666507] to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IPs or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 1 day, that is, immediately but no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site within 
1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately.  Investigators or other site personnel should inform [COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE 
within 1 calendar day, that is, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an automated email alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel 
reports an SAE to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative by [CONTACT_756].
The [COMPANY_008] representative will advise the Investigator/study site personnel how to 
proceed.

and tremelimumab. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_514226].  A medical emergency usually constitutes an SAE 
and is to be reported as such.
6.5 Overdose
Use of IP in doses in excess of that specified in the protocol is considered to be an overdose.  
There is currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose of IP, and possible symptoms of overdose are not established. 
! An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
! An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the 
Investigators or other site personnel should inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives 
immediately or no later than [ADDRESS_666509] reporting timelines apply (see 
Section 6.4).  For other overdoses, reporting must occur within [ADDRESS_666510] interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.
  The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the patientwas discontinued from the study.

Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666511] 2015
88(131)If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 1 day, that is, immediately but no 
later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 
5 calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within [ADDRESS_666512] dose.  
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, 
or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose should, if possible, be 
followed up and documented.
Where a report of pregnancy is received, prior to obtaining information about the pregnancy, 
the Investigator must obtain the consent of the patient’s partner.  Therefore, the local study 
team should adopt the generic ICF template in line with local procedures and submit it to the relevant Ethics Committees (ECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) prior to use.
6.7 Management of IP-related toxicities 
The following general guidance should be followed for management of toxicities.
! Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (including holding the 
agent suspected of causing the toxicity if required).
! If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consideration should be 
given to continuing the same dose of the assigned IP along with appropriate 
continuing supportive care.  If medically appropriate, dose modifications are permitted (see the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines).
! All dose modifications should be documented with clear reasoning and 
documentation of the approach taken.
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which MEDI4736 and tremelimumab should be 
permanently discontinued (see Section 3.9and the Dosing Modification and Toxicity 
Management Guidelines).
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666513] 2015
89(131)Following the first dose of IP, subsequent administration of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab 
can be modified based on toxicities observed as described in the Dosing Modification and 
Toxicity Management Guidelines.  All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03.  Dose reductions are not permitted. In case of doubt, the Investigator should 
consult with the Study Physician.  
6.7.1 MEDI4736 and MEDI4736 + tremelimumab
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are events of scientific and medical interest specific 
to the further understanding of the MEDI4736 and tremelimumab safety profile and require 
close monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_514287].  MEDI4736 
and tremelimumab AESIs may be serious or non-serious.  The rapid reporting of these AESIs allows ongoing analysis of these events in order to characterize and understand them in 
association with the use of these IPs. 
Information on MEDI4736 and MEDI4736 + tremelimumab AESIs and guidelines for the 
management of immune-mediated reactions, infusion-related reactions, and non-immune-
mediated reactions for MEDI4736 and MEDI4736 + tremelimumab are provided in the 
Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines.
6.7.[ADDRESS_666514]: Part B should be managed as per local 
guidelines and the relevant approved labelling.
6.8 Study governance and oversight
The safety of all [COMPANY_008] clinical studies is closely monitored on an ongoing basis by 
[CONTACT_178560].  Issues identified will be addressed; for instance, this could involve amendments to the study protocol and letters to 
Investigators.

MEDI4736 will be supplied by [CONTACT_62653] a 500-mg vial for solution for infusion. The 
solution contains 50 mg/mL MEDI4736, 26 mM histidine/histidine hydrochloride, 275 mM 
trehalose dihydrate, and 0.02% (weight/volume) polysorbate 80; it has a pH of 6.0.  Total in-use storage time from needle puncture of MEDI4736 vial to the start of administration 
should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  If 
the in-use storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials.  MEDI4736 does not contain preservatives, and any unused portion must be discarded.  
MEDI4736 vials should be stored at refrigerated temperatures (2°C to 8°C), and should not be 
frozen.
Preparation of MEDI4736 doses for administration with an IV bag
The dose of MEDI4736 for administration must be prepared by [CONTACT_737]’s or site’s 
designated IP manager using aseptic technique.  Doses of 1.5 g will be administered using a 
bag containing 250 mL 0.9% (weight/volume) saline and delivered through an IVadministration set with a 0.2- μm in-line filter.  A volume of 0.9% (weight/volume) saline 
equal to the volume of MEDI4736 to be added to the IV bag must be removed from the bag 
prior to the addition of MEDI4736.  The calculated volume of MEDI4736 is then added to the IV bag, and the bag is mixed by [CONTACT_471385].
Preparations are to be in accordance with the study-specific drug handling instructions.
No incompatibilities between MEDI4736 and polyeth ylene, polypropy lene, polyvinylchloride, 
or polyolefin copolymers have been observed.
7.1.2 Tremelimumab
Tremelimumab is supplied as a sterile solution for IV infusion, filled in 20-mL clear glass 
vials with a rubber stopper and aluminum seal.  Each vial contains 20 mg/mL (with a nominal fill of 20 mL, accounting to 400 mg/vial) of tremelimumab, in isotonic solution at pH 5.5.  
Tremelimumab vials should be stored at refrigerated temperatures (2°C to 8°C), and should 
not be frozen.
Product preparation and reconstitution of tremelimumab
The dose of tremelimumab for administration must be prepared by [CONTACT_737]’s or site’s 
designated IP manager using aseptic technique.  Total in-use storage time from needle 
puncture of the product vial to start of administration should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  If in-use storage time exceeds these 
limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials.  Tremelimumab does not contain 
preservatives, and any unused portion must be discarded.
Preparation of tremelimumab doses for administration with an IV bag
Doses of 75 mg will be administered using a bag containing 250 mL 0.9% (weight/volume) 
saline and delivered through an IV administration set with a 0.2- μm in-line filter.  A volume 
of 0.9% (weight/volume) saline equal to the volume of tremelimumab to be added to the IV

Standard of care
Patients randomized to the SoC treatment arm of Part B: RCT will receive SoC treatment with 
a gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (for patients whose first-line chemotherapy was 
fluorouracil-based) or fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (for patients whose first-line chemotherapy was gemcitabine-based).  Treatment will be as per local guidelines.
7.2.2 Duration of treatment
Treatment will be administered beginning on Day 1.  
Patients in Part A or Part B will receive MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination for 12 months or until confirmed PD, unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met, or unless the criterion for 
initiating retreatment on MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy is met as described below. Patients enrolled in the SoC arm of Part B: RCT will discontinue study drug at the 
first assessment of disease progression per RECIST 1.1.  
Patients randomized to the MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab arms who 
meet the retreatment criteria below for their respective treatment arm will follow the same treatment guidelines followed during the initial 12-month treatment period, including the same dose and frequency of treatments and the same schedule of assessments, with the exception of the PK, ADA, sPD-L1, SNP, MDSC, and nAB assessments, which do not need to be collected a second time.  Retreatment will not be permitted for patients randomized to SoC treatment in Part B: RCT.  Crossover within the study will not be permitted.  Patients who meet the criteria for retreatment for their respective treatment arm may only receive retreatment once.
Patients randomized to monotherapy MEDI4736 may undergo retreatment in 1 clinical scenario, described below:
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666520] 2015
93(131)1. Patients who achieve or maintain disease control (ie, CR, PR, or SD) through to the 
end of the 12-month treatment period may restart their assigned treatment with 
MEDI4736 upon evidence of PD, with or without confirmation and according to RECIST 1.1, during follow-up.
Patients randomized to the combination of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab arm may undergo 
retreatment in 2 clinical scenarios, described below:
1. Patients who achieve and maintain disease control (ie, CR, PR, or SD) through to 
the end of the 12-month treatment period may restart treatment with the 
combination upon evidence of PD, with or without confirmation and according to RECIST 1.1, during follow-up. 
2. Patients who complete the 4 dosing cycles of the combination of MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab portion of the regimen (with clinical benefit per Investigator judgment), but subsequently have evidence of PD during the MEDI4736 
monotherapy portion of the combination regimen, with or without confirmation 
according to RECIST 1.1, may restart treatment with the combination.
For both treatment arms, before restarting their assigned treatment, the Investigator should 
ensure that the patient:
1. Does not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that indicate 
continuing treatment will not further benefit the patient
2. Still fulfills the eligibility criteria for this study, including re-consenting to restart IP
3. Has not have received an intervening systemic anticancer therapy after their 
assigned treatment discontinuation
4. Has had a baseline tumor assessment within 28 days of restarting their assigned 
treatment; all further scans should occur with the same frequency as during the initial 12 months of treatment (relative to the date of restarting treatment) until 
study treatment is stopped (maximum of 12 months of further treatment).
During the retreatment period, patients in the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab arm will resume 
MEDI4736 dosing at 1.[ADDRESS_666521] dose of combination therapy, up to a total of 9 additional doses, with the final dose at Week 48.
Patients in the MEDI4736 monotherapy treatment arm will resume MEDI4736 dosing at 1.5 g
q4w for up to 12 months (up to 13 doses).
Patients who the Sponsor and Investigator determine may not continue treatment after 
confirmed PD during the 12-month initial treatment period or in the 12-month retreatment

94(131)period will enter follow-up. Patients who have discontinued treatment due to toxicity or 
symptomatic deterioration, or who have commenced subsequent anticancer therapy, will be 
followed up until confirmed disease progression or death (whichever occurs first).
Treatment through progression and retreatment in the MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 
+ tremelimumab arms is at the Investigator’s discretion, and the Investigator should ensure 
that patients do not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that indicate that continuing treatment will not further benefit the patient. The Investigator should ensure 
that patients still meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for this 
study and that these patients meet the following specific criteria for treatment in the setting of PD: 
! Written informed consent to continue treatment or retreatment in the setting of PD.  
This consent document will specify that treatment beyond initial evidence of PD is 
not the standard-of-care and that alternative treatment options, either locally 
licensed treatments or other clinical trials, are available for this patient population.
! Absence of clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant disease 
progression and no decline in ECOG performance status to >1
! Absence of rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical 
sites (eg, central nervous system metastasis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_90860], or spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377]) requiring urgent alternative medical 
intervention
A patient with confirmed progression randomized to the MEDI4736 arm cannot continue 
therapy with MEDI4736 or obtain retreatment with MEDI4736 if dosing is ongoing and the 
progression occurs in a target lesion that has previously shown a confirmed response. A patient with a confirmed progression randomized to the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab arm 
cannot continue therapy or obtain retreatment if dosing is ongoing in the combination portion 
of therapy and progression occurs in a target lesion that has previously shown a confirmed response.
7.3 Labelling
Labels will be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local regulatory guidelines.  The labels will fulfill GMP Annex [ADDRESS_666523] under appropriate storage conditions.  The IP
label on the pack/bottle/carton specifies the appropriate storage.  Storage is also described in the IB.

8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY [CONTACT_76383]
8.1 Statistical considerations
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) within [ADDRESS_666531] enrolled patient 
and any subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments completed prior to reporting of the data.
8.2 Sample size estimate
Part A: Lead-in and Part B: Expansion
Once [ADDRESS_666532] 15 patients in each arm (ie, a minimum 
follow-up of [ADDRESS_666533]-baseline tumor assessments at Week 6 and Week 12), predictive probability will be used to calculate the chance of observing at least 5 out of 30 responses 
(≥15% CR/PR) in each arm, and at least 15 out of 30 patients achieving DCR at 12 weeks 
(≥50% DCR12).  This will make use of a Beta –Binomial posterior predictive distribution, 
where at the outset a non-informative prior is assumed for the ORR or DCR12 (Beta[1,1]), 
and a Beta-Binomial distribution can then be used to calculate the probability of achieving the 
required ORR or DCR from 30 evaluable patients given the data observed (see Table 8 ).  If
predictive probability is <10% for both ORR and DCR12, recruitment into the arm in which 
this happens will be stopped.  A different decision outside of these criteria may be made, if the 
totality of the data supports it.  Recruitment will continue while predictive probability is calculated.  If an arm is to be stopped following the predictive probability calculation, no new 
patients will be recruited to that arm, but patients who are already on study will continue in 
accordance with study guidelines outlined in Section 7.2.  If enrollment is fast enough so that, 
by [CONTACT_29623] 15 patients are evaluable (Weeks 6 and 12 tumor assessment data available), all 
[ADDRESS_666534] 2015

15 evaluable patients (both criteria to be met to stop an arm)
Endpoint Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106] (predictive probability)
ORR 0/15 (1.8%)
DCR12 <5/15 (5.3%)
If an ORR >25% (ie, ≥8 CR/PR) is recorded among the first 30 treated patients in either of the 
treatment arms in Part A (unless the totality of the data supports a different decision), an additional 70 patients will be enrolled in that arm, for a total of 100 evaluable patients per arm 
in the Part B: Expansion study.  
In Part B, 100 patients (30 from Part A plus an additional 70 from Part B) will provide 
>90% power for an exact test of a single proportion, assuming a null hypothesis (H
0) of 
ORR=10%, and an alternative hypothesis (H A) of ORR=25%, at the 2-sided 0.05 alpha level. 
(Critical value, ORR = 16.7%), while also providing adequate patients to reasonably characterize the safety profile of the expanded arm(s).  A 10% response rate is considered a 
reasonable assumption for the average response rate achieved by [CONTACT_286995][INVESTIGATOR_514228]-line advanced pancreatic cancer ( Rahma et al 2013 ).
Part B: Randomized, controlled trial
Should the ORR in Part A in at least 1 arm be >15% ( ≥5/30 responses) then a randomized 
controlled trial may be initiated.  
If initiated, this will be a separate randomized, open- label, multi-center, study to determine 
the efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 monotherapy and/or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy versus SoC chemotherapy (1:1:1 or 1:1) with primary endpoint of OS.  If 
both arms are taken forward from Part A, then the primary comparison will be to compare MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC.  Approximately 125 additional 
patients per treatment arm will be randomized in this Part B: RCT. Treatment for MEDI4736 
monotherapy and/or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab will only be included in this RCT if the corresponding treatment meets the appropriate criteria in Part A. A final decision to initiate 
Part B (RCT) will be made after evaluation of all available efficacy and safety data from the 
lead in phase (Part A), and may not be limited to the decision rules provided in the protocol.  The data from Part B: RCT will be analyzed separately and will not be pooled with Part A for 
the purpose of statistical analysis.
It is assumed that median OS on SoC chemotherapy will be [ADDRESS_666535] of the experimental therapy emerging relative to SoC 
(ie, an HR of [ADDRESS_666536] 2 months ) followed by [CONTACT_514290] 0.51 thereafter and a minimum 
follow-up time of 11.5 months from the end of patient recruitment, this yields an anticipated overall average HR of 0.63.  Under these assumptions, analysis would occur after 196 events 
in a 250-patient, 2-arm study (78% maturity, 196/250) and would be expected around

99(131)20.[ADDRESS_666538] 90% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference 
at a 2-sided 5% significance level (critical value for HR of 0.75). 
Non-uniform accrual of patients (with k=1.5) over 9 months is assumed when estimating the 
analysis times.  The total proportion of patients randomized at time t [t ≤9 months] following 
the start of the study is therefore assumed to be (t/9)1.5.

8.4 Outcome measures for analyses
8.4.1 Calculation or derivation of efficacy variables
The analysis of the primary endpoint for Part A: Lead-in) and Part B: Expansion, ORR, will 
be based on Investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1.  Sensitivity analyses for this ORR in Part A: Lead-in and Part B: Expansion will be conducted based on Investigator 
assessment according to RECIST 1.1 modified for confirmation of progression.  OS will be 
evaluated as the primary endpoint in Part B: RCT.
The analyses of the secondary endpoints of ORR, DoR, DCR, PFS, PFS2, PFS3, and PFS6
will be based on Investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1.  OS, OS6, and OS12 will 
also be evaluated as secondary endpoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS] RECIST 1.1-based endpoints
Investigator RECIST 1.1-based assessmentsAll RECIST assessments, whether scheduled or unscheduled, will be included in the 
calculations.  This is also regardless of whether a patient discontinues study treatment or 
receives another anticancer therapy. 
At each visit, patients will be programmatically assigned a RECIST 1.1 visit response of CR, 
PR, SD, or PD depending on the status of their disease compared with baseline and previous 
assessments.  Baseline will be assessed within the 28 days prior to the treatment start date.  If a patient has had a tumor assessment that cannot be evaluated, then the patient will be 
assigned a visit response of not evaluable (NE; unless there is evidence of progression, in 
which case the response will be assigned as PD).  Endpoints (of ORR, DoR, DCR, PFS, PFS2, PFS3, and PFS6) will be derived from the overall visit response date and the scan dates.
Please refer to Appendix F f or the definitions of CR, PR, SD, NE, and PD.
Storage of data for possible BICR of RECIST 1.1-based assessments
All radiological scans for all patients (including those at unscheduled visits or outside visit 
windows) will be stored for possible assessment by [CONTACT_19377].

Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666541] 2015
101(131)[IP_ADDRESS] Primary endpoints
Objective response rateThe primary endpoint for Part A: lead-in and Part B: Expansion is ORR, which will be 
assessed according to Investigator assessment.  ORR (per RECIST 1.1) is defined as the 
number (%) of patients with a confirmed overall response of CR or PR and will be based on the Full Analysis Set. A confirmed response of CR/PR means that a response of CR/PR is 
recorded at [ADDRESS_666542] observed with no evidence of progression between the initial and CR/PR confirmation visit.  Therefore, 
data obtained up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of 
progression, will be included in the assessment of ORR.  Any patient who discontinues treatment without progression, receives a subsequent therapy, and then responds will not be 
included as responders in the ORR.
For sensitivity analysis, ORR will be assessed using the RECIST Investigator assessed tumor 
data following a modification where any objective progression requires confirmation.  
Therefore, data obtained up until confirmed progression, or the last evaluable assessment in 
the absence of a confirmed progression, will be included in the assessment of ORR.  Note that the response may be after an unconfirmed progression.
Overall survival
The primary endpoint for Part B: RCT is OS.  OS is defined as the time from the date of 
randomization until death due to any cause.  Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to 
be alive.
Note: Survival calls will be made in the week following the date of data cut-off for the 
analysis, and if patients are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is post the data cut-off 
date, these patients will be censored at the date of data cut-off. Death dates may be found by 
[CONTACT_255750].
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary endpoints
Duration of responseDoR (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by [CONTACT_76377]) will be defined as the time 
from the date of first documented response until the first date of documented progression or 
death in the absence of disease progression.  The end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_666543] 2015
102(131)Additionally, DoR will be obtained using the algorithm described, but following a 
modification where any objective progression requires confirmation.  Therefore, the end of 
response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause.  The time of the initial response will be defined as the latest of the dates contributing toward the first visit 
response of PR or CR.  Note that the time of initial response may be after an unconfirmed 
progression.
Disease control rate
DCR at [ADDRESS_666544] objective 
response (BoR) of CR or PR in the first [ADDRESS_666545] 
demonstrated SD for a minimum interval of 12 or 52 weeks, respectively (-7 days, ie, 105 or 357 days, respectively), following the start of study treatment.  
DCR will be determined programmatically based on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_666546] progression event.  This will use all data up until the progression event that is used for the analysis (ie, unconfirmed progressions are not 
considered progression events, which means that the BoR that contributes to the DCR may be 
after an unconfirmed progression for some patients).
Progression-free survival (PFS)
PFS (per RECIST 1.1 using Investigator assessments) will be defined as the time from the 
date of first dose/randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by 
[CONTACT_72999]) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from allocated/randomized therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression.  
Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of 
the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_666547] baseline data, they will be censored at 0 days unless they die within 2 visits of baseline.  
The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates not visit dates.
RECIST 1.1 assessments/scans contributing towards a particular visit may be performed on 
different dates.  The following rules will be applied:
! For investigational assessments, the date of progression will be determined based on 
the earliest of the RECIST assessment/scan dates of the component that indicates 
progression.
! When censoring a patient for PFS, the patient will be censored at the latest of the 
dates contributing to a particular overall visit assessment.

103(131)Note: For target lesions, only the latest scan date is recorded out of all scans performed at that 
assessment for the target lesions, and similarly for non-target lesions, only the latest scan date 
is recorded out of all scans performed at that assessment for the non-target lesions.
PFS based on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_666549] be no sooner than 4 weeks after the initial 
suspected progression.  If disease progression is confirmed (or disease progression occurs and no further scans are recorded) then the date of progression will be when it was originally 
observed.  Patients with a single disease progression and no further tumor assessment scans 
will be treated as PD in the analysis.  In the absence of significant clinical deterioration, the investigational site is advised to continue the patient on study therapy until progression has 
been confirmed.  If progression is not confirmed, the patient should continue study therapy 
and on-treatment assessments.  For Part B: RCT, patients enrolled in the SoC arm will discontinue study drug at the first assessment of disease progression.
Progression-free survival2 (second progression) (PFS2)
Time from randomization to second progression (PFS2) is defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the earliest of the progression event(s) subsequent to that used for the PFS endpoint or death.  Patients alive and for whom a second disease progression has not been 
observed should be censored at the last time known to be alive and without a second disease 
progression, that is, censored at the latest of the PFS or PFS2 assessment date if the patient has not had a second progression or death.
Proportion of patients alive and progression-free after 3 months
The PFS rate at 3 months (PFS3) will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates.  Tumor 
progression will be determined based on Investigator assessment and RECIST 1.1.
Proportion of patients alive and progression-free after 6 months
The PFS rate at 6 months (PFS6) will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates.  Tumor 
progression will be determined based on Investigator assessment and RECIST 1.1.
Proportion of patients alive at 6 months from randomization/enrollment
The OS6 will be defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS at 6 months.

evaluable assessment in the absence of RECIST progression.
Categorization of BoR will be based on RECIST ( Appendix F)  using the following response 
categories: CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE.
BoR will be determined programmatically based on RECIST using all Investigator assessment 
data up until the first progression event.  Furthermore, it will be determined programmatically based on RECIST modified for confirmation of progression.  This will use all data up until the 
progression event that is used for the analysis (ie, unconfirmed progressions are not 
considered progression events, which means that the BoR may be after an unconfirmed progression for some patients).
For patients whose progression event is death, BoR will be calculated based upon all 
evaluable RECIST assessments prior to death.
For patients who die with no evaluable RECIST assessments, if the death occurs 13 weeks 
(ie, 12 weeks ±7 days) after enrollment, then BoR will be assigned to the PD category.  For 
patients who die with no evaluable RECIST assessments, if the death occurs >13 weeks (ie, 12 weeks ±7 days) after the date of enrollment, then BoR will be assigned to the NE 
category.
Progression events that have been censored due to them being >[ADDRESS_666551] 
evaluable assessment will not contribute to the BoR derivation.
8.4.2 Calculation or derivation of safety variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse eventsData from all cycles of treatment will be combined in the presentation of safety data.  AEs 
(both in terms of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] preferred terms and CTCAE grade) will be listed individually by [CONTACT_4676].  
Any AE occurring before treatment with IP will be included in the data listings but will not be 
included in the summary tables of AEs.  Any AE occurring within 90 days of discontinuation of IP (ie, the last dose of a given IP therapy) may be included in the AE summaries, but the 
majority of those summaries will omit the AEs observed after a patient has received further 
therapy for cancer.  Further details will be provided in the SAP.  Any events in this period that occur after a patient has received further therapy for cancer (following discontinuation of IP) 
will be flagged in the data listings.
A separate data listing of AEs occurring more than 90 days after discontinuation of IP will be 
produced.  These events will not be included in AE summaries. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other significant adverse events
During the evaluation of the AE data, an [COMPANY_008] medically qualified expert will review 
the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation.  Based on 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666552] 2015
105(131)the expert’s judgment, significant AEs of particular clinical importance may, after 
consultation with the Global Patient Safety Physician, be considered other significant adverse 
events (OAEs) and reported as such in the CSR.  A similar review of laboratory/vital signs/ECG data will be performed for identification of OAEs.  Examples of these are marked 
hematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain events that lead to intervention 
(other than those already classified as serious) or significant additional treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety assessments
For the change from baseline summaries for vital signs, laboratory data, ECGs, and physical 
examination, the baseline value will be the latest result obtained prior to the start of study 
treatment.  
The QTcF will be derived during creation of the reporting database using the reported ECG 
values (RR and QT).
QTcF = QT/RR^ (1/3) where RR is in secondsCorrected calcium will be derived during creation of the reporting database using the 
following formulas:
Corrected calcium (mmol/L) = Total calcium (mmol/L) + ([40 – albumin (G/L)] × 0.02)The denominator used in laboratory summaries will only include evaluable patients, in other 
words, those who had sufficient data to have the possibility of an abnormality.  
For example:
! If a CTCAE criterion involves a change from Baseline, evaluable patients would 
have both [ADDRESS_666553]-dose value recorded
! If a CTCAE criterion does not consider changes from baseline, to be evaluable the 
patient need only have [ADDRESS_666554]-dose-value recorded.
The denominator in vital signs data should include only those patients with recorded data.
8.4.3 Calculation or derivation of patient-reported outcome variables
PRO questionnaires will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, EORTC 
QLQ-PAN26 questionnaire, and PRO-CTCAE.  All items/questionnaires will be scored 
according to published scoring guidelines or the developer’s guidelines, if published 
guidelines are not available.  All PRO analyses will be based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS; ITT population), unless stated otherwise.
[IP_ADDRESS] EORTC QLQ-C30
The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions that can be combined to produce 5 functional 
scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666555] 2015
106(131)nausea/vomiting), 6 individual items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, 
and financial difficulties), and a global measure of health status (overall health and overall 
quality of life).  The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be scored according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 scoring manual ( Fayers et al 2001 ).  An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 
will be derived for each of the symptom scales/symptom items, each of the functional scales, 
and the global health status scale in the EORTC QLQ-C30 according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual.  Higher scores on the global health status and functioning scales 
indicate better health status/function, but higher scores on symptom scales/items represent 
greater symptom severity.
The change from baseline in HRQoL will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 global 
QoL scale, which includes 2 items from the EORTC QLQ-C30: “How would you rate your 
overall health during the past week?” (Item 29) and “How would you rate your overall QoL during the past week?” (Item 30).
Definition of clinically meaningful changes
Changes in score compared with baseline will be evaluated.  A minimum clinically 
meaningful change is defined as an absolute change in the score from baseline of ≥10 for 
scales/items from the EORTC QLQ-C30 ( Osoba et al 1998 ).  For example, a clinically 
meaningful improvement in physical function (as assessed by [CONTACT_26740]-C30) is defined 
as an increase in the score from baseline of ≥10, whereas a clinically meaningful deterioration 
is defined as a decrease in the score from baseline of ≥10.  At each post-baseline assessment, 
the change in symptoms/functioning from baseline will be categorized as improvement, 
no change or deterioration as shown in Table 10 .
Table 10 Mean change and visit response in health related quality of life

scales≥+10 Improvement

Otherwise No change
For each subscale, if <50% of the subscale items are missing, then the subscale score will be 
divided by [CONTACT_514291] ( Fayers et al 2001 ). If at least 50% of the items are missing, then that subscale will

107(131)be treated as missing. Missing single items are treated as missing. The reason for any missing 
questionnaire will be identified and recorded.  If there is evidence that the missing data are 
systematic, missing values will be handled to ensure that any possible bias is minimized.
Exploratory PRO endpoints
Time to symptom deterioration
For each of the symptoms scales in the EORTC QLQ-C30, time to symptom deterioration will 
be defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first clinically meaningful 
symptom deterioration (an increase in the score from baseline of ≥10) or death (by [CONTACT_55544]) 
in the absence of a clinically meaningful symptom deterioration, regardless of whether the 
patient withdraws from study treatment or receives another anticancer therapy prior to 
symptom deterioration.  Death will be included as an event only if the death occurs within [ADDRESS_666557] PRO assessment where the symptom change could be evaluated.  
Patients whose symptoms (as measured by [CONTACT_26740]-C30) have not shown a clinically 
meaningful deterioration and who are alive at the time of the analysis will be censored at the time of their last PRO assessment where the symptom could be evaluated.  Also, if symptoms 
deteriorate after [ADDRESS_666558] baseline data he or she will be censored at 0 days.  
Time to HRQoL/function deterioration
For HRQoL (as measured by [CONTACT_26740]-C30), time to deterioration will be defined as the 
time from the date of randomization until the date of the first clinically meaningful 
deterioration (a decrease in the function scales or the global health status/HRQoL from 
baseline of ≥10) or death (by [CONTACT_55544]) in the absence of a clinically meaningful 
deterioration, regardless of whether the patient withdraws from study treatment or receives 
another anticancer therapy prior to HRQoL/function deterioration.  Death will be included as 
an event only if the death occurs within [ADDRESS_666559] PRO assessment where the HRQoL/function change could be evaluated.  
Patients whose HRQoL (as measured by [CONTACT_26740]-C30) have not shown a clinically 
meaningful deterioration and who are alive at the time of the analysis will be censored at the time of their last PRO assessment where the HRQoL/function could be evaluated.  Also, if 
HRQoL deteriorates after [ADDRESS_666560] PRO assessment where HRQoL/function could be evaluated.  If a patient has no evaluable 
visits or does not have baseline data he or she will be censored at 0 days.  
Symptom improvement rate
The symptom improvement rate will be defined as the number (%) of patients with 
[ADDRESS_666561] 14 days apart that show a clinically meaningful 
improvement (a decrease from baseline score ≥10 for EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom scales) in 
Clinical Study Protocol

108(131)that symptom from baseline.  The denominator will consist of a subset of the ITT population 
who has a baseline symptom score ≥10.
HRQoL/function improvement rate
The HRQoL/function improvement rate will be defined as the number (%) of patients with 
[ADDRESS_666563] 14 days apart that show a clinically meaningful 
improvement (an increase from baseline score ≥10 for EORTC QLQ-C30 functional scales 
and global health status/HRQoL) in that scale from baseline.  
[IP_ADDRESS] EORTC QLQ-PAN26
For EORTC QLQ-PAN26, 7 multi-item subscales scores (pancreatic pain [4 items], eating 
related [2 items], hepatic [2 items], altered bowel habit [2 items], body image [2 items], health 
care satisfaction [2 items], sexuality [2 items]) and 10 single-item scales (swollen abdomen, taste changes, indigestion, flatulence, weight loss, loss of muscle strength, dry mouth, burden 
of treatment, fear of future health, and ability to plan future) will be derived as specified in the 
scoring manual.
[IP_ADDRESS] Calculation or derivation of healthy state utility (EQ-5D-5L)
The EQ-5D-5L index comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression).  For each dimension, respondents select which 
statement best describes their health on that day from a possible 5 options of increasing levels of severity (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme 
problems).  A unique EQ-5D health state is referred to by a 5-digit code allowing for a total of 
3125 health states.  For example, state [ZIP_CODE] indicates no problems on any of the 5 dimensions.  These data will be converted into a weighted health state index by [CONTACT_514292]-5D value sets elicited from general population samples (the base case will be 
the [LOCATION_008] valuation set, with other country value sets applied in scenario analyses).  Where values sets are not available, the EQ-5D-5L to EQ-5D-3L crosswalk will be applied.  
In addition to the descriptive system, respondents also assess their health on the day of 
assessment on a visual analogue scale, ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).  This score is reported separately.  The evaluable population will comprise 
the FAS (ITT population).
8.4.4 Calculation or derivation of pharmacokinetic variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response/safety analysisA population PK model analysis might be performed using a nonlinear mixed-effects 
modelling approach.  The impact of physiologically-relevant patient characteristics 
(covariates) and disease on PK will be evaluated.  The relationship between the PK exposure 
and the effect on safety and efficacy endpoints will be evaluated.  The results of such an analysis will be reported in a separate report.  The PK, pharmacodynamics, demographic, 
safety, and efficacy data collected in this study may also be combined with similar data from 
other studies and explored using population PK and/or PK-pharmacodynamic methods.

109(131)[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic noncompartmental analysis
The actual sampling times will be used in the PK calculations.  PK concentration data and 
summary statistics will be tabulated.  Individual and mean blood concentration-time profiles 
will be generated.  PK parameters will be determined using standard noncompartmental methods.  The following PK parameters will be determined after the first and steady-state 
doses: peak and trough concentration (as data allow).  Samples below the lower limit of 
quantification will be treated as missing in the analyses.
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity analysis
Immunogenicity results will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_514293]4736 monotherapy or
MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab.  The immunogenicity titer and presence of neutralizing ADAs will be reported for samples confirmed positive for the presence of ADAs.  
The effect of immunogenicity on PK, pharmacod ynamics, effi cacy, and safety will be 
evaluated, if the data allow.
8.4.[ADDRESS_666565] consent to participation in the 
genetic research and the date the blood sample was taken from the patient will be recorded in 
the eCRF and database.  The genetic data generated from the study will be stored in the 
[COMPANY_008] Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database or other appropriate system.  This database is a secure database, which is separate from the database 
used for the main study.  Some or all of the dataset from the main study may be duplicated 
within the [COMPANY_008] LIMS database for exploratory genetic analysis.  Data will be reported outside the CSR (please see  Appendix D ).
8.[ADDRESS_666566] 2015
110(131)Baseline will be the last assessment of the variable under consideration prior to the intake of 
the first dose of IP, except for efficacy variables.  For efficacy variables, baseline is defined as 
the last visit prior to treatment start date.
All data collected will be listed.  Efficacy and PRO data will be summarized and analyzed 
based on the FAS.  PK data will be summarized and analyzed based on the PK Analysis Set.  
Safety data will be summarized on the Safety Analysis Set.
All outputs will be summarized by [CONTACT_514294] (ITT).   
Results of all statistical analysis will be presented using a 95% CI and 2-sided p-value, unless

111(131)8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variables
Objective response rateThe primary endpoint (ORR) for Part A and Part B: Expansion (if initiated) will be estimated 
for each treatment arm with 95% exact CIs.  The primary analysis will be based on the 
programmatically derived ORR based on Investigator assessments, and using all scans regardless of whether they were scheduled or not.  An additional sensitivity analysis will be 
performed on programmatically derived ORR using Investigator data (RECIST modified for 
confirmation of progression) to determine if there is any difference when using progression confirmation rules.  
The primary analysis population for ORR will be the FAS .
Summaries will be produced that present the number and percentage of patients with a tumor
response (CR/PR).  The number (%) of patients with a confirmed response and the number 
(%) of patients with a single visit response (ie, an unconfirmed response) will also be 
presented.
Overall survival
Kaplan-Meier plots of OS will be presented for each treatment arm of the study.  Summaries 
of the number and percentage of patients who have died, are still in survival follow-up, are 
lost to follow-up and have withdrawn consent will be provided along with median OS for each cohort/treatment arm (if calculable). 
The OS6 will be summarized (using the Kaplan-Meier curve) and presented for each treatment 
arm.
For Part B: RCT, the primary OS analysis will be performed in the ITT population using a 
stratified log-rank test adjusting for response to prior chemotherapy and type of prior 
chemotherapy.  The effect of each experimental arm versus SoC treatment will be estimated by [CONTACT_514296] 95% CI and p-value.
The HR and its CI can be estimated from the stratified log-rank as follows ( Berry et al 1991 ,

is its standard deviation, k denotes the stratum, and 
d1kiand e 1kiare the observed and expected events in Group 1, stratum k.
The assumption of proportionality will be assessed.  Proportional hazards will be tested firstly 
by [CONTACT_514297]-log (event times) versus log (time) and, if these 
raise concerns, by [CONTACT_6486] a time-dependent covariate to assess the extent to which this 
represents random variation.  If a lack of proportionality is evident, the variation in treatment effect will be described by [CONTACT_514298][INVESTIGATOR_514229]-periods.  In 
such circumstances, the HR can still be meaningfully interpreted as an average HR over time 
unless there is extensive crossing of the survival curves.  If lack of proportionality is found, this may be is a result of treatment-by-covariate interactions, which will be investigated.
A sensitivity analysis for OS will examine the censoring patterns to rule out attrition bias, 
achieved by a Kaplan-Meier plot of time to censoring where the censoring indicator of OS is reversed.
Subgroup analyses will be conducted comparing OS between treatments in the following 
subgroups of the FAS:
! Response to previous chemotherapy (CR/PR/SD vs PD)
! Type of previous chemotherapy (5-FU-containing or gemcitabine-containing 
chemotherapy)
The HR (MEDI4736 or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab: SoC) and 95% CI in each subgroup will 
be calculated from a single Cox model.  These will be presented on a forest plot including the 
HR and 95% CI from the overall population. 
Other baseline variables may also be assessed if there is clinical justification or an imbalance 
is observed between the treatment arms.  The purpose of the subgroup analyses is to assess the 
consistency of treatment effect across expected prognostic factors.
The presence of quantitative interactions will be assessed by [CONTACT_514299].  This will be performed in the overall population by [CONTACT_496557] a 
Cox proportional hazards model including treatment, all covariates, and all covariate-by [CONTACT_496558], with one that excludes the interaction terms and will be assessed 
at the 2-sided 10% significance level.  If the fit of the model is not significantly improved then 
it will be concluded that overall the treatment effect is consistent across the subgroups.
If the global interaction test is found to be statistically significant, an attempt to determine the 
cause and type of interaction will be made.  Stepwise backwards selection will be performed 
on the saturated model, whereby (using a 10% level throughout) the least significant interaction terms are removed one-by-one and any newly significant interactions re-included

113(131)until a final model is reached where all included interactions are significant and all excluded 
interactions are nonsignificant.  Throughout this process all main effects will be included in 
the model regardless of whether the corresponding interaction term is still present.  This approach will identify the factors that independently alter the treatment effect and prevent 
identification of multiple correlated interactions.
Any quantitative interactions identified using this procedure will then be tested to rule out any 
qualitative interaction using the approach of Gail and Simon 1985 .
If there are too few events available for a meaningful analysis of a particular subgroup (it is 
not considered appropriate to present analyses where there are less than 20 events in a subgroup), the relationship between that subgroup and OS will not be formally analyzed.  In 
this case, only descriptive summaries will be provided.
8.5.2 Analysis of the secondary variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of responseIn order to analyze the DoR between treatment arms (only relevant for Part B randomized, 
controlled study), the Expected Duration of Response (EDoR) will be derived for each 
treatment arm ( Ellis et al 2008 ).  The EDoR is the product of the proportion of patients 
responding to treatment and the mean DoR in responding patients and provides an estimate based on all randomized patients.  Treatments will be compared by [CONTACT_514300], using an appropriate probability distribution (to be specified in the SAP) for DoR in 
responding patients.  Additionally, descriptive data will be provided for the DoR in responding patients, including the associated Kaplan-Meier curves (without any formal 
comparison of treatment arms or p-value attached).
[IP_ADDRESS] Disease control rate
The DCR will be summarized (ie, number of patients).

Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS will be presented for each treatment arm.  Summaries of the 
number and percentage of patients who have died, are still in survival follow-up, are lost to 
follow-up and have withdrawn consent will be provided along with median OS for each cohort (if ca+lculable). 
Additionally, for Part B: RCT, formal comparative analysis of PFS will be carried out in the 
same way as for OS.
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression-free survival2 (second progression)
For Part B: RCT, PFS2 will be summarized and analyzed in the same way as PFS.
[IP_ADDRESS] Proportion of patients with progression-free survival after 3 months and 
6 months
The PFS and PFS6 will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, as the cumulative 
probability of progression-free survival to each of those two time periods.  Estimates of PFS3 and PFS6 will each be presented with 95% CIs.  Median progression-free survival and plots of 
PFS rates over time will also be presented, based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates. 
8.5.3 Proportion of patients alive at 6 and 12 months
The OS6, and OS12, will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative 
probability of survival at each of those time periods.  The survival estimates of OS6 and OS12 
will be presented with 95% CIs.  Median survival and survival plots over time will also be 
produced and presented, based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. 
8.5.4 Patient-reported outcomes
The analysis population for PRO data will be the PRO analysis set including patients with 
evaluable baseline EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 forms.  The HRQoL and pancreatic 
pain will be assessed through an analysis of the EORTC-QLQC30 global QoL and PAN-26 pancreatic pain scales.
[IP_ADDRESS] EORTC QLQ-C30
Adjusted mean change from baseline in global QoL score will be analyzed using a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of all of the post-baseline scores for each visit and will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  The study discontinuation visit and the safety 
follow-up visit will be excluded from this analysis. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) 
estimation will be used. The model will include treatment, visit and treatment by [CONTACT_514301] a covariate. Treatment, visit 
and treatment by [CONTACT_514302].  The treatment by [CONTACT_514303].
An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within-subject error and the 
Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to estimate the degrees of freedom.

115(131)If the fit of the unstructured covariance structure fails to converge, the following covariance 
structures will be tried in order until convergence is reached: toeplitz with heterogeneity, 
autoregressive with heterogeneity, toeplitz, and autoregressive. 
The adjusted mean change from baseline estimates and corresponding 95% CIs will be 
presented by [CONTACT_514304].
As a supportive analysis, EORTC QLQ-C30 global QoL score improvement rate will be 
analyzed using a logistic regression model.  If the overall response rate is <5%, no analysis 
will be performed (note that if the response rate in only one of the treatment groups is <5% but ≥5% in the other treatment group then the analysis will still be performed). If the overall 
expected response rate is low (<20%) a Fisher’s exact test will be considered and mid p-values 
used. The results of the analysis will be presented in terms of an odds ratio together with its associated profile likelihood CIs and p-values (based on twice the change in log-likelihood 
resulting from the addition of a treatment factor to the model).
EORTC QLQ-C30 compliance (overall compliance and by [CONTACT_514305]) will be 
summarized for each treatment group.
Descriptive statistics and graphs will be reported for the global QoL score by [CONTACT_514306]. Summary tables of EORTC QLQ-C30 best overall QoL response as defined in Table 10 will be provided (improvement, deterioration, no 
change).
[IP_ADDRESS] EORTC QLQ-PAN26
Patient-reported outcomes as measured by [CONTACT_26740]-PAN26 will be summarized 
descriptively; the change from baseline for domain, subscale scores, and individual items by 
[CONTACT_514307]. EORTC 
QLQ-PAN26 compliance (overall compliance and by [CONTACT_514305]) will be summarized for each treatment group.
Exploratory analyses
Exploratory analyses examining adjusted mean change from baseline will be performed for 
EORTC QLQ-C30 functioning domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social) and 
for the individual EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 symptom scales/items (with a 
particular focus on pancreatic pain, fatigue, nausea, weight loss [difficulty gaining weight/loss of appetite], and jaundice), using the same MMRM model described for the global QoL score.
Descriptive statistics and graphs will be reported for the EORTC QLQ-C30 functioning 
domains and EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 symptom scales/items (specifically pancreatic pain, fatigue, nausea, weight loss [difficulty gaining weight/loss of appetite], and 
jaundice).

3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting) and the 5 individual symptom items 
(dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, and diarrhea).  Time to QoL/function deterioration will be analyzed for the 5 function scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, 
and social) and global health status/QoL.  This will be achieved by [CONTACT_514308] a stratified log-rank test as described for the primary analysis of OS.  The sensitivity analysis to ascertain attrition bias will be performed as described for the primary analysis of 
OS.  However, subgroup analyses and treatment interaction testing will not be performed.  
The HR and 95% CI for each scale/item will be presented graphically on a forest plot.
A summary of the symptom improvement rate for each of the 3 symptom scales and the 
5 individual symptom items will be produced.  Similarly, a summary of QoL/function 
improvement rate for each of the 5 function scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social) and global health status/QoL will be produced.  Symptom improvement rate and 
QoL/function improvement rate will be analyzed by [CONTACT_514309] 
a logistic regression model as described for the analysis of ORR.  The odds ratio and 95% CI for each scale/item will be presented graphically on a forest plot.

2(4)FURTHER GUIDANCE ON THE DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)
Life threatening
“Life-threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the patient’s 
death.  “Life-threatening” does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it 
might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169939] a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the study.
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, or incapacity but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_666611] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
Examples of such events are:
! Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment
! Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring 
treatment with N-acetylcysteine
! Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
! Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
! Development of drug dependency or drug abuse

Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666612] 2015
3(4)A GUIDE TO INTERPRETING THE CA[LOCATION_003]LITY QUESTION
The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable 
possibility” that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
! Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the patient actually received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of the suspect drug?
! Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? OR could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties?
! Dechallenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96699]?
! No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_255759], other drugs, or other host or environmental factors.
! Rechallenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped?  [COMPANY_008] would not normally recommend or support a rechallenge.
! Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship?
A “reasonable possibility” could be considered to exist for an AE where [ADDRESS_666613], there would not be a “reasonable possibility” of causality if none of the above 
criteria apply or where there is evidence of exposure and a reasonable time course but any dechallenge (if performed) is negative or ambiguous or there is another more likely cause of 
the AE.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
! Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?
! Is there a known mechanism?
Ambiguous cases should be considered as being a “reasonable possibility” of a causal 
relationship unless further evidence becomes available to refute this.  Causal relationship in 
cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified 
as no reasonable possibility.

4(4)MEDI4736 DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS
There is no information to date on drug-drug interactions with MEDI4736 either pre-clinically 
or in patients.  As MEDI4736 is a monoclonal antibody and therefore a protein, it will be 
degraded to small peptides and amino acids and will be eliminated by [CONTACT_514318].  It is therefore not expected that MEDI4736 will induce or inhibit the major drug metabolising cytochrome P450 pathways.  As a result, there are no 
expected pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.  The mechanism of action of MEDI4736 
involves binding to PD-L1, and therefore significant pharmacodynamic drug interactions with the commonly administered concomitant medications are not expected.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], 
appropriate clinical monitoring in all of the planned clinical studies will be conducted to 
evaluate any potential drug-drug interactions.

2(2)LABELING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 
3 categories.  For transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to 
risk groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) in the 46th edition 
(2005).  Infectious substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B, or Exempt.  There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and Categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals.  Category A pathogens, eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:
! are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infectious substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens are, eg, Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2.  They are assigned the following UN 
number and proper shippi[INVESTIGATOR_72919]:
! UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category B
! are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt - all other materials with minimal risk of containing pathogens
! Clinical trial samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations
! Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient 
temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging 
! Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods 
specification for the dry-ice content
! IATA compliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packing and 
transportation and packing should be done by [CONTACT_73013], as 
applicable

4(7)1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
[COMPANY_008] intends to perform genetic research in the MEDI4736 clinical development 
program to explore how genetic variations may affect the clinical parameters associated with 
this drug combination.  Collection of DNA samples from populations with well described 
clinical characteristics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, possibly, to genetically guided treatment strategies.
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not 
only response to MEDI4736, but also susceptibility to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma for which MEDI4736 may be evaluated.  Thus, this genetic research may involve study of 
additional un-named genes or gene categories, but only as related to pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma and MEDI4736 treatment.
2. GENETIC RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
The objective of this research is to collect and store DNA, derived from a blood sample, for 
future exploratory research into genes/genetic variation that may influence response 
(ie, distribution, safety, tolerability and efficacy) of MEDI4736 and/or susceptibility to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
3. GENETIC RESEARCH PLAN AND PROCEDURES
3.[ADDRESS_666620]
All enrolled patients will be asked to participate in this genetic research (Substudy 3 only).  
Participation is voluntary, and if a patient declines to participate, there will be no penalty or 
loss of benefit.  The patient will not be excluded from any aspect of the main study.
3.1.[ADDRESS_666621] fulfill all of the inclusion criteria 
described in the main body of the Clinical Study Protocol and:
! Provide informed consent for the genetic sampling and analyses.
3.1.3 Exclusion criteria
Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in the 
main study or any of the following:
! Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D
Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666622] 2015
5(7)! Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample 
collection
3.1.4 Discontinuation of patients from this genetic research
Specific reasons for discontinuing a patient from this genetic research are:
Withdrawal of consent for genetic research:  patients may withdraw from this genetic research 
at any time, independent of any decision concerning participation in other aspects of the main study.  Voluntary discontinuation will not prejudice further treatment.  Procedures for 
discontinuation are outlined in Section 3.9 of the main 
Clinical Study Protocol .
3.2 Collection of samples for genetic research
The blood sample for genetic research will be obtained from the patients at baseline after 
randomization.  Although genotype is a stable parameter, early sample collection is preferred 
to avoid introducing bias through excluding patients who may withdraw due to an adverse 
event (AE), as these patients would be important to include in any genetic analysis.  Only [ADDRESS_666623] laboratory.  No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person ([COMPANY_008] employee or 
contract laboratory staff working with the DNA.)
The samples and data for genetic analysis in this study will be single coded.  The link between 
the patient enrollment/randomization code and the DNA number will be maintained and 
stored in a secure environment, with restricted access WITHIN the Clinical Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_479930] (LIMS) at [COMPANY_008].  The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results 
with clinical data, allow regulatory audit and to trace samples for destruction in the case of 
withdrawal of consent.

6(7)4. ETHICAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
The principles for ethical and regulatory requirements for the study, including this genetics 
research component, are outlined in Section 10 of the main Clinical Study Protocol.
4.1 Informed consent
The genetic component of this study is optional, and the patient may participate in other components of the main study (Substudy 3 only) without participating in the genetic component.  To participate in the genetic component of the study, the patient must sign and 
date both the consent form for the main study (Substudy 3) and the genetic component of the 
study.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_514234].  The Principal Investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that 
consent is given freely and that the patient understands that he or she may freely discontinue 
from the genetic aspect of the study at any time.
4.[ADDRESS_666625] party, unless 
required to do so by [CONTACT_2371].
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identity of the patient.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might 
see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a patient.  For example, in the case of 
a medical emergency, an [COMPANY_008] Physician or an investigator might know a patient’s identity and also have access to his or her genetic data.  Also Regulatory authorities may 
require access to the relevant files, though the patient’s medical information and the genetic 
files would remain physically separate.
5. DATA MANAGEMENT
Any genotype data generated in this study will be stored in the [COMPANY_008] genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_479958], or other appropriate secure system within [COMPANY_008] and/or third party contracted 
to work with [COMPANY_008] to analyze the samples.
The results from this genetic research may be reported separately from the CSR for the main 
study.
Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merged with the genetic data 
in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.

7(7)6. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE
The number of patients that will agree to participate in the genetic research is unknown.  It is 
therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal 
statistical evaluation or whether only descriptive statistics will be generated.  A statistical 
analysis plan will be prepared where appropriate.

3(8)1. INTRODUCTION
This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately 
report cases of Hy’s Law.  It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management 
of elevated liver biochemistries.  Specific guidance on the managing liver abnormalities can 
be found in Section 5.2.1 of the protocol and in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines.
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry.  The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study.
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL cr iteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver 
biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_255762] (IMP). 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome 
of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.
2. DEFINITIONS
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3 × upper limit of 
normal (ULN) together with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥2 × ULN at any point during the study 
following the start of study medication irrespective of an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP). 
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with TBL ≥2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug.  
For PHL and HL to be met the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with 
(ie, on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.

4(8)3. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination:
! ALT ≥3×U L N
! AST ≥3×U L N
! TBL ≥2×U L N
If a central laboratory is used
When a patient meets any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the 
central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Investigator (also sent to [COMPANY_008] representative). 
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the 
identification criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
! Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by [CONTACT_2237]
! Complete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory CRF module(s) with the original 
local laboratory test result
When the identification criteria are met from central or local laboratory results the Investigator 
will without delay:
! Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 2of this appendix 
for definition) by [CONTACT_48886] (including 
both central and local laboratory results)
If a local laboratory is used
The Investigator will, without delay, review each new laboratory report and if the 
identification criteria are met will:
! Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 2of this Appendix 
for definition) by [CONTACT_48886]
! Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory CRF

5(8)4. FOLLOW-UP
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
! Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance 
provided in the Clinical Study Protocol.
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
! Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study Team 
The Study Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss, and agree an 
approach for the study patients’ follow-up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to 
this contact [CONTACT_48887]:
! Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated 
! Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as 
discussed with the Study Physician. If a central laboratory is used, this includes 
deciding which the tests available in the Hy’s law lab kit should be used.
! Complete the 3 Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available 
! If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures
5. REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW 
CASES
The instructions in this section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
No later than [ADDRESS_666632] 2015
6(8)If there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
! If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
! If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingly and follow the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
! Report an SAE (report term “Hy’s Law”) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes. 
∀The “Medically Important” serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
∀As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
“related” should be assigned.
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:
! Report an SAE (report term “Potential Hy’s Law”) applying serious criteria and 
causality assessment as per above
! Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the review
6. ACTIONS REQUIRED WHEN POTENTIAL HY’S LAW
CRITERIA ARE MET BEFORE AND AFTER STARTING 
STUDY TREATMENT 
This section is applicable to patients with liver metastases who meet PHL criteria on study 
treatment having previously met PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study treatment. 
At the first on study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria being met the Investigator will:
! Determine if there has been a significant change in the patients’ condition#
compared with the last visit where PHL criteria were met#
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix E
Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666633] 2015
7(8)∀If there is no significant change no action is required
∀If there is a significant change notify the [COMPANY_008] representative, who will 
inform the central Study Team, then follow the subsequent process described in 
Section 4.2of this Appendix
# A “significant” change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this 
may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.
7. ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR REPEAT EPI[INVESTIGATOR_291429]’S LAW
This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has 
already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.
The requirement to conduct follow-up, review, and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.  
The Investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the following question:
! Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met 
found to be the disease under study, eg, chronic or progressing malignant disease, 
severe infection or liver disease, or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior to starting study treatment and at their first on study treatment visit as described in 
Section 6?
If No: follow the process described in Section 4.2of this Appendix
If Yes:
Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’s condition
#compared with 
when PHL criteria were previously met
! If there is no significant change, no action is required
! If there is a significant change, follow the process described in Section 4.2of this 
Appendix
# A “significant” change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of

4(14)1. INTRODUCTION
This appendix details the implementation of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) 1.1 guidelines ( Eisenhauer et al 2009 ) for the D4198C00001 study with regards to 
Investigator assessment of tumor burden including protocol-specific requirements for this 
study.
2. DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE, NON-MEASURABLE, 
TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in the study.  
Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_100681] (by [CONTACT_393] 1.1) 
lesion which has not been previously irradiated.  A tumor lesion in a previously irradiated 
field can be assessed as measurable disease provided the lesion has been deemed to demonstrate progression.
Measurable:
A lesion, not previously irradiated per the protocol prior to enrollment, that can be accurately 
measured at baseline as ≥[ADDRESS_666639] diameter (except lymph nodes which must 
have short axis ≥15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements.  A tumor lesion in a previously irradiated field can be assessed as measurable disease provided the lesion has been 
deemed to demonstrate progression.
Non-measurable:
! All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10 mm to <15 mm short axis at baseline
1).
! Truly non-measurable lesions include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal 
organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_514320].
! Lesions <2 cm biopsied within the screening period (fresh tumor biopsy)
                                                
1Nodes with <10 mm short axis are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed as 
non-target lesions (NTLs).

5(14)! Previously irradiated lesions that have not demonstrated progression2
! Brain metastasis
Special cases:
! Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic–blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the 
definition of measurability.  Blastic lesions are considered non-measurable.
! Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for 
measurability from a radiological point of view, but if non-cystic lesions are present 
in the same patient, these should be selected as target lesions (TLs).
Target lesions:
A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative 
of all lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TLs at baseline.
Non-target lesions:
All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at 
baseline.
3. METHODS OF ASSESSMENT
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during follow-up visits.
A summary of the methods to be used for RECIST assessment is provided in Table [ADDRESS_666641] 2015

3.[ADDRESS_666643] / MRI of the chest and abdomen, pelvis only when suspected or 
documented disease involvement.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual patients.  CT examination 
with intravenous contrast media administration is the preferred method.  MRI should be used 
where CT is not feasible or it is medically contra-indicated.  For brain lesion assessment, MRI is the preferred method.

X-ray is recommended where bone scan findings are equivocal.
3.9 FDG-PET scan
In the D4198C00001 study, 18-Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions, according with thefollowing algorithm:  New lesions will be recorded where there is positive 
18-Fluoro-deoxyglucose uptake
3not present on baseline FDG-PET scan or in a location 
corresponding to a new lesion on CT/MRI at the same follow-up visit.  If there is no baseline FDG-PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesions on CT/MRI scans then follow-up 
CT/MRI assessments should be continued, scheduled as per protocol or clinical indicated, in 
order to confirm new lesions.
                                                
3A positive FDG-PET scan lesion should be reported only when an uptake greater than twice that of the 
surrounding tissue is observed.

4.[ADDRESS_666647]/MRI assessments of the chest and abdomen, 
pelvis only when suspected or documented disease involvement.  Additional anatomy should 
be imaged based on signs and symptoms of individual patients at baseline and follow-up.  
Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before start of study treatment, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment 
(see Table 2 of the Clinical Study Protocol).  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 
6 weeks (q6w±7 days) for the first [ADDRESS_666648] infusion, and q12w±[ADDRESS_666649] confirmed objective disease progression for 
patients remaining on assigned treatment, re-treatment, or until subsequent cancer therapy according to the clinical study protocol.
Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be adequately imaged at 
follow-up.
If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the patient has not progressed, every attempt 
should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their scheduled visits.  This 
schedule is to be followed in order to minimize any unintentional bias caused by [CONTACT_514321] a different frequency than other patients.
4.2 Target lesions
4.2.1 Documentation of target lesions
A maximum of 5 measurable lesions, with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ (including 
lymph nodes), representative of all lesions involved should be identified as TL at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions or short axis for nodal lesions), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected.
The site and location of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for 
non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes).  All measurements should be recorded in millimeters.  At baseline the sum of the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum of diameters.  At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be 
calculated and reported as the follow-up sum of diameters.

9(14)Special cases:
! For TL measurable in [ADDRESS_666651] diameter.  For 
pathological lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short 
axis. 
! If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is >5 mm, the minimum size of measurable 
disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan.
! If a lesion has completely disappeared, the longest diameter should be recorded as 
0 mm.
! If a TL splits into two or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those 
parts. 
! If two or more TLs merge then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion 
should be recorded for one of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesion(s).  
! If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned.  If an accurate measure can be given, this 
should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
! If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an estimate 
of the size of the lesion. 
! When a TL has had any intervention eg, radiotherapy, embolization, surgery, during 
the study, the size of the TL should still be provided where possible.
4.2.2 Evaluation of target lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor visit 
response for TL (see Table 2 ).
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix F
Drug Substance MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab
Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666652] 2015
10(14)Table 2 Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all TLs since baseline.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm.
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking 
as reference the baseline sum of diameters
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD
Progression of disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the TLs were not assessed or not evaluable 
or had a lesion intervention at this visit.  Note: if the sum of 
diameters meets the progressive disease criteria, progressive 
disease overrides not evaluable as a TL response
CR  Complete response; PR  Partial response; PD  Progression of disease; NE  Not evaluable; SD  Stable disease; 
TL  Target lesion.
4.3 Non-target lesions
4.3.1 Evaluation of non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at 
baseline.  Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status should be followed at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL response should be 
recorded by [CONTACT_737].  This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to 
determine and record overall response for NTL at the investigational site at each visit (see Table 3 ).
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix F

Study Code D4198C00001Edition Number [ADDRESS_666653] 2015
11(14)Table 3 Evaluation of non-target lesions
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all NTLs since baseline.  All lymph nodes must 
be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).
Non CR/Non PD Persistence of one or more NTL.
Progression (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing NTLs.  Unequivocal 
progression may be due to an important progression in one lesion 
only or in several lesions.  In all cases the progression MUST be clinically significant for the physician to consider changing (or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) therapy.
Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant when one or some of the NTLs were not assessed 
and, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], they are not able to provide an 
evaluable overall NTL assessment at this visit.
Note: for patients without TLs at baseline, this is relevant if any of 
the NTLs were not assessed at this visit and the progression 
criteria have not been met.
CR  Complete response; PR  Partial response; PD  Progression of disease; NE  Not evaluable; NTL  Non-target 
lesion; TL  Target lesion.
To achieve “unequivocal progression” on the basis of NTLs, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of stable disease or partial response in TLs, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.  A modest “increase” in the size of 1 or more NTLs is usually not 
sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.
4.4 New lesions
Details of any new lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment.  The presence of one or more new lesions is assessed as progression. 
A lesion identified at a follow up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in 
scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumor.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumor 
assessments should be continued until the new lesion has been confirmed.  If repeat scans 
confirm there is a new lesion, then the progression date should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

12(14)4.5 Symptomatic deterioration
Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].
Patients with “symptomatic deterioration” requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should continue to undergo tumor assessments where possible until objective disease progression is observed.
4.6 Evaluation of overall visit response
The overall visit response will be derived using the algorithm shown in Table 4 .

13(14)5. CONFIRMATION OF PROGRESSION
In the D4198C00001 study, imaging for confirmation of response (complete response or 
partial response) should be performed at next scheduled visit (and no less than 4 weeks) 
following the date the criteria for response were first met.
Disease progression requires confirmation.  The confirmatory scan should occur preferably at 
the next scheduled visit and no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of progression 
of disease (PD) in the absence of clinical deterioration.
Progression would be considered confirmed if the following criteria are met:
! ≥20% increase in the sum diameters of TLs compared with the nadir at 
2 consecutive visits with an absolute increase of 5mm(1)
! And/or significant progression (worsening) of NTLs or new lesions at the 
confirmatory PD time-point compared with the first time point where progression of 
NTLs or new lesions identified
! And/or additional new unequivocal lesions at the confirmatory PD time-point 
compared with the first time point new lesions identified.
(1)The assessment of progression requires a ≥20% increase in the sum diameters of target 
lesions at the first progression timepoint relative to the nadir.  The nadir is the smallest sum of 
diameters, and this may be at baseline or subsequent follow-up assessments.  The confirmatory scan confirms the persistence of the ≥20% increase relative to the nadir.  The 
minimum absolute increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions is at least 5 mm at both 
assessments.
In the absence of significant clinical deterioration the Investigator should continue assigned
treatment until progression is confirmed.  If progression is not confirmed, then the patient 
should continue on assigned treatment and on treatment assessments.  
If a patient discontinues treatment (and/or receives a subsequent cancer therapy) prior to 
progression, then the patient should still continue to be followed until confirmed objective 
disease progression.

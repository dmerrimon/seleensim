IND#  135491  
Study Title:  A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Multi- Centered Study of 
the Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of CBP- 201 in 
Adult Subjects with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis  
Study Phase:  2 
Study Treatment:  CBP -201 is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds human interleukin-
4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα), a common subunit of the interleukin 4 (IL-4) and 
interleukin 13 (IL -13) receptor dimers. CBP-201 blocks signaling from both 
IL-4 and IL-13 which are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of atopic 
dermatitis (AD).  CBP -201 is administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection.  
Planned number of Study Sites (s): Approximately [ADDRESS_11911] Enrollment  Approximately 220 
Indication:  Moderate- to-severe atopic dermatitis  
Population:  Adults aged [ADDRESS_11912] moderate to severe atopic 
dermatitis  and otherwise meet eligibility criteria may be considered for 
enrollment into the study. 
Study Duration:  Approximately 213  days.  
• Screening period: up to 45 days 
• Treatment period: 16 weeks  
• Follow- up (no dosing) period: 8 weeks  
  
Study Design; Study 
Treatment Dosing Schedules  This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, dose regimen finding 
study to assess the efficacy, safety, and  steady -state PK profile of CBP -201 
administered to eligible adult subjects with moderate to severe AD.  The 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 5 of 93 
 study is divided into a treatment period of 16 weeks and a follow -up period of 
8 weeks.  
Note that CBP -201 is provided as a single- use 2 mL vial cont aining 1.2 mL 
clear to slightly yellow sterile solution of CBP -201 targeted to be 
approximately 150 mg/mL.  Placebo is provided as a single -use 2 mL vial 
containing 1.2 mL solution without CBP -201.  Similar volumes and number 
of vials are to be used for placebo doses.   
Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1  into one of the following 4 dosing 
regimen groups (see in -text table below for a visual representation): 
• CBP -201: 600 mg (4 vials) on D1, 1 vial of CBP -201 and  1 vial of 
placebo on W2 and the same dose Q2W thereafter through W16.  Total 
CBP -201 dose over 16 weeks: 1800 mg. 
• CBP -201: 600 mg (4 vials) on D1, CBP -201 300 mg ( 2 vials) on W 2 and 
Q2W thereafter through W 16.  Total CBP-201 dose over 16 weeks: 3000 
mg. 
• CBP -201 600 mg (4 vials) on D1, placebo (2 vials) on W2, CBP-201 300 
mg (2 vials) on W4, W8, W12 and W16, alternating with placebo (2 
vials)  on W6, 10, and 14.  Total CBP-201 dose over 16 weeks: 1800 mg.  
• Placebo only: 4 vials on D1 , 2 vials on W2  and Q2W thereafter through 
W16. 
 
Note: C = CBP -201; P = placebo; #x = # vials  
Using sterile technique, for the CBP- 201 300 mg dose, 1 mL is to be 
withdrawn from each of 2 vials to result in approximately 300 mg CBP -201, 
and for 600 mg dose, 1 mL is to be withdrawn from each of 4 vials to result 
in approximately 600 mg.  Similarly, for the placebo dose, 1 mL is to be withdrawn from each of 2 vials to result in the equivalent volume to the 300 
mg CBP -201 dose, and for 600 mg, 1 mL is withdrawn from each of 4 vials.  
For the 150 mg CBP- 201 dose, in order to maintain the blind, 1 mL is to be 
withdrawn from each of a CBP -201 vial and a placebo vial to deliver the 
same volume as a 300 mg CBP -201 dose.

Study Periods:  Screening Period (D -45 to D -1) 
After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for study 
eligibility at an initial screening visit within 45 days before the baseline visit 
(Baseline) .   
Baseline (D1)  
Prior to dosing on D1, subjects who have met eligibility criteria during Screening will have eligibility confirmed and undergo baseline assessments 
and procedures and undergo randomization to scheduled treatments. 
Treatment Period (D1 to W16)  
Randomized subjects will receive every other week (Q2W) SC injections of 
CBP -[ADDRESS_11914]-dose thereafter.   
Assessment for adverse events (AEs) and collection of concomitant medications and treatments will be done c ontinuously throughout the study.  
Treatment with a bland emollient will be done twice daily throughout the study.  Subjects may use any bland emollient recommended by [CONTACT_12502]. 
Subjects will return to clinic for testing and assessment as described in the 
Schedule of Events (
Table 1 ). 
Follow -up Period (W17-W24)  
Subjects will be followed for an additional 8 weeks after the W16 treatments 
for safety, efficacy and to further charac terize the PK and PD profile of CBP -
201. 
Subjects will return to clinic for testing and assessment as described in the 
Schedule of Events (Table 1 ).   
In the case of an early termination (ET) from the study for any reason, 
study completion assessments should be performed as detailed for the 
study completion visit and should be completed within 7 days of the 
ET, whenever possible .  
Blood samples will be collecte d from all subjects throughout the study (see 
Schedule of Events) to evaluate the CBP -201 steady- state PK profile and PD 
effects on serum  thymus and activation- regulated chemokine (TARC) levels, 
total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, peripheral eosinophil counts and serum

levels of IL -4 and IL -13.  Samples for measurement of antibodies to CBP -201 
(anti-drug antibody [ ADA] , all samples that are positive in the ADA assay will 
be further tested for the presence of anti- CBP -201 neutralizing antibody [ Nab] ) 
will be obtained  as described in the Schedule of Events ( Table 1 ). 
Screening (D -45 to D- 1): Following signed informed consent, eligibility will be confirmed. Medical 
history, physical examination (including height and weight), concomitant 
medication review, clinical laboratory tests, including tests for HIV and 
hepatitis, and a 12- lead ECG will b e obtained during this period. A blood 
pregnancy test will be obtained for all women of child-bearing potential. 
AD severity and impact will be assessed as follows:  
By [CONTACT_093]:  
• Investigators Global Assessment (IGA):  vIGA -AD™ , 5-point categorical 
scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) 
based on  the overall appearance of the lesions at a given time point.. 
• Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI): EAS I score measures the 
severity and extent of AD and erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head/neck, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points ; higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD.    
• Percent body surface area (BSA) AD involvement with maximum percentages for each region using the “rule of nines”: head and neck [9%], 
anterior trunk [18%], back [18%], upper limbs [18%], lower limbs [ 36%], 
and genitals [1%].   The number of handprints of AD skin in a body region 
can be used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region is involved 
with AD. The area represented by [CONTACT_12503]'s hand 
with all five digits adducted together, is approximately 1% of the subject's 
BSA, regardless of the subject's age. Handprints across various body 
regions assessed is used to calculate BSA %  AD involvement.  
• Severity scoring of AD (SCORAD): a clinical tool for assessing the severity (extent/intensity) of AD and subjective signs/symptoms (e.g. 
pruritus/insomnia).  The extent of AD lesions is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area a nd reported as the sum of all areas, with a 
maximu m score of 100% . The intensity is determined by [CONTACT_12504] 6 items on a scale from 0 to 3 (erythema, edema, oozing/crusting, excoriations, lichenification and dryness).  Each item is be scored on the most representative area for a given intensity item.  Subjective symptoms 
are graded using a visual analogue scale (VAS) where 0 = no itch (or 
insomnia) and 10 = worst imaginable itch (or insomnia).  The total score is the sum of extent/5 + 7 x intensit y/2 + VAS (symptoms) with a SCORAD 
range between 0 and 103; higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD.

• Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (P P-NRS):  an assessment tool that 
subject s will use to report the maximum itch intensity  over the previous 24 
hours where 0 = ‘no itching ’ to 10  =  ‘worst itch imaginable ’.  See Section 
16.1 Appendix A . 
• Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI): a 10-item questionnaire 
assessing the impact of AD on quality of life (QOL) over the past week, 
with an overall scoring of 0 (absent disease) to 30 (severe disease); higher 
scores indicative of poorer QOL.   See Sectio n 16.2 Appendix B . 
• Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM): a 7 -item questionnaire 
assessing disease symptoms on a 0 to 4 scale (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) with a scoring system of 0 (absent disease) to 28 (severe disease); higher scores indicative of poorer 
quality of life.  See Section 
16.3 Appendix C . 
Each assessment or questionnaire is performed at various times during the 
study as detailed in the Schedule of Events ( Table 1 ) 
Subjects will also be instructed to apply a bland emollient twice a day to 
affected areas for the dura tion of the study (from  at least  7 days prior to 
Baseline to end of study).   Subjects may use any bland emollient 
recommended by [CONTACT_12505].

• Number ( %) of subjects displaying positive anti -drug antibodies (ADA)  
Pharmacokinetic (PK)  
Endpoints : Whole blood for plasma CBP -[ADDRESS_11919] treatment dose as noted 
above to characterize the return to baseline.  
Pharmacodynamic (PD)  
Endpoints : Changes from Baseline will be summarized with descriptive statistics in serum  
levels of IL -4, IL-13, IgE, TARC and peripheral eosinophil counts. 
Additional sampling will be obtained after the last treatment dose as noted 
above to characterize return to baseline.  
Sample Size Determination  A sample size of 220 (55 per arm, providing approximately 44 completers per 
treatment group assuming 20% dropout rate) will provide 95% power to detect 
the treatment effect on the primary endpoint between the CBP -201 300 mg 
Q2W vs. Placebo. This power calculation is based on the assumptions that the non-inferiority margin of 35%  and the significance level is 0.[ADDRESS_11920] deviation of 45 %.  
To further detect the other treatment effects vs. Placebo, and also preserve the alpha at 0.[ADDRESS_11921] dose (300 mg Q2W) to the lowest dose (150 mg dose Q2W), until statistical significance at 0.05 level is not achieved.
 
Study Populations; Interim Analyses: The following six analysis populations are planned for this study:  
• All Subjects Screened (Screened) set will contain all subjects who signed 
informed consent. 
• All Randomized Set (Randomized) will contain all subjects who are randomized into the study, no matter whether they are all treated or not.  
• The Safety Set (SS) will include all randomized subjects who receive at 
least part of an SC dose of study treatment.  SS will be based on the actual 
treatment  received . 
• The PK Set (PKS)  will include all randomized subjects who receive at 
least [ADDRESS_11922] 1 PK sample 
collected and analyzable . 
• The Full Analysis Set  (FAS) will include all randomized subjects who 
receive at least  part of a n SC  dose of study treatment.  FAS will be based 
on the planned treatment  (i.e., “ as randomized ”). 
• The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will contain a subset of FAS subjects who do 
not have any major protocol deviation s.   
 Study centers, subjects, and study team members directly involved in study 
activities will remain blinded to study treatment assignments until final database lock, after the last subject completes  the study.

Footnotes : 
[ADDRESS_11923] be reconfirmed on D1 prior to dosing.   Medical history also should be reviewed on D1 prior to dosing.  
2 Hepatitis screen: hepatitis B surface antigen or core antibody and hepatitis C antibody.  
3 At screening, Week 16 and EOS/ET, a complete physical examination (PE) will be performed which includes the following: General appearance, skin, eyes/ears/nose/thro at, 
head and neck, heart , lungs , abdomen, extremities, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal and neurologic. A rectal or genital examination is not required unless necessary to assess for AD 
involvement. Focused PE can be completed at visits when a schedulerd PE is  not done, with attention to areas affected by [CONTACT_12517] .

8 On the days that ADA is to be drawn, the ADA sample can be taken from PD sample. A separate sample for ADA assessmen t does not need to be drawn.  Also ensure that the 
sample is large enough for Nab analysis i f ADA is positive  
9 Assessments/procedures should be conducted in the following order: Patient reported outcomes (PROs), Investigator assessments, safety and laboratory assessments, and then 
administration of the study drug. Pre-dose Investigator  assessment s include EASI, IGA, BSA, and SCORAD. Investigator assessments should be performed by [CONTACT_12518] a single subject, when possible . 
10 Pre-dose Patient Reported Outcomes includes P P-NRS, DLQI, and POEM. However , PP-NRS is included as a separate row in the SoE since completion of this diary has a 
different schedule  
11The PP-NRS (daily itch diary) will be distributed at start of Screening and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_12519] (D 1). PP-NRS must be completed at Screening, 
and a daily diary for subject completion for the [ADDRESS_11926] dose from W 6 on; assessments  and testing should be completed pre -dose except as otherwise 
noted.  Rotate injection sites: abdomen [avoid area proximal to umbilicus], outer thigh, upper arm [ lateral or posterolateral ]. 
[ADDRESS_11927] instrument that will be provided to each study site for evaluating injection site findings. Clinically significant findings as 
determined by [CONTACT_12520]. On dosing days,  the previous injection site(s) (except on D1) should be assessed prior to dosing and the new injection 
site should be assessed prior to release.  
[ADDRESS_11928] (AESIs) will be collected at each study visit.   
During follow -up period beyond study completion or after an ET, only those SAEs considered to be related to study treatment should be repor ted. 
16 Unscheduled or early termination (ET) visits may occur at any time.  Unscheduled visits (UVs) may occur to assess AEs or disease progression, for example. It is left to 
Investigator discretion to determine what if any assessments are appropriate for an UV, however VS, physical examination, assessment of injection sites, query subject for any 
AEs and new concomitant medications or treatments at the minimum should be performed.  UVs occurring after W24 may  be scheduled to follow AEs to resolution or 
establis hment of a new baseline (progression of AE has been stabilized)  or for assessments regarding disease progression.  After an ET, a visit should be scheduled promptly to 
determine the reason for ET and to perform study closeout assessments assuming the subject is willing to return to the clinic and undergo such procedures.   Note that subjects 
who develop any CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_11929] be discontinued from further 
study treatment dosing and monitored until resolution or stabilization.  
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May [ADDRESS_11930] been made as applicable in the document.  
Changes made throughout this protocol are as noted below:  
• Title of protocol was changed to delete reference to “double-dummy”  
Rationale: The term is not fully accurate, as no true double- dummy design is incorporated  
• Title of protocol was changed to delete reference to “repeated dose”  
Rationale: The term is not necessary to include and is somewhat redundant to design  
• Title of protocol was changed to change reference of “patients” to “adult subjects”  
Rationale : The term “subjects” is otherwise used throughout the protocol, rather than “patients” 
and “adult” is added for additional clarity  
• IND Number is added  
Rationale: Information had become available to add to protocol  
• Sponsor Company Name [CONTACT_12579]: To correct inconsistent use of name  
• “Reviewed By” field is removed from Protocol Authorization page  
Rationale: Inclusion was determined to be unnecessary  
• “Approved By” signature [CONTACT_12580]: Chief Medical Officer position is currently vacant,  and CEO is signing for approval  
• The optional blinded treatment extension is removed, along with references and associated 
activities throughout protocol   
Rationale: The blinded extension was determined to add little or no value to the key data collection 
nor to assessment / achievement of key study endpoints 
• Amendment of Previous Sample Size Justification section. 
Rationale: the previous power and sample size calculation was based on empi[INVESTIGATOR_10477]. With 
preliminary results at week [ADDRESS_11931] can b e more estimated.  
• Inclusion Criterion #1 is amended to allow the moderate to severe AD subjects for whom topi[INVESTIGATOR_12447]: To enable the study to assess the efficacy and safety in moderate to severe AD subjects 
for whom topi[INVESTIGATOR_12448].  According to the clinical guideline, this 
part of patient population may benefit from Biologics treatment. In addition, based on the 
mechanism of CBP -201 and the preliminary ef ficacy data of CBP -201, CBP- 201 treatment may 
prove to be beneficial to moderate to severe AD subjects for whom topi[INVESTIGATOR_12449].: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 21 of 93 
• Specific diagnosis criteria of atopic dermatitis is added to the inclusion criteria #1.  
Rationale:  To specify American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria, Eichenfield 2014 
will be used to confirm the diagnosis of AD in this study. 
• Amendment of inclusion criteria #1 for Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score: adjusted 
the cut-off value of EASI score at Screening and Baseline visits from 12 to 16 
Rationale:  The adjustment of the cut- off value of EASI score at Screening and Baseline visits will 
ensure the study target patient population to be more consistent with the clinical guideline with 
respect to the biologic-eligible AD patient 
• Inclusion Criterion #1 is updated to add further explanation of Investigator Global Assessment 
(IGA) score  
Rationale:  To clearly define Validated Investigator Global Assessment scale for Atopic Der matitis  
(vIGA -AD™ ) would be used in this study, matching licensed requirements for naming of tool, and 
to provide clarification of  the IGA scores  
• Inclusion criteria #3 was updated to remove the time limitation of surgical sterilization prior to screening for women  
Rationale: Women with documented evidence of surgical sterilization at any time prior to 
Screening should not be considered Females of child -bearing potential (FCBP). The requirement of 
having had surgical sterilization at least 6 month s prior to screening is unnecessary  
• The required washout period for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450], systemic treatment for AD and other biologics apart from cell depleting agents are updated in Exclusion criteria #2  
Rationale:  Required washout period prior to Baseline for treatment agents above are updated in 
accordance to their pharmacokinetic characteristics  
• Washout periods for systemic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_12451] (TCM) or herbal medications were added to exclusion criteria #2  
Rationale: Concomitant treatmen t of systemic or topi[INVESTIGATOR_12451] (TCM) or 
herbal medications may interfere with study efficacy and safety assessments  
• Prohibition of oral and parental antibiotics, antivirals, or systemic antifungals within 8 weeks prior to Baseline in  exclusion criteria #2 is moved to exclusion criteria #3 and is amended 
Rationale:  To further clarify the subjects with infections requiring treatment with systemic anti -
infective agents within 4 weeks before the Baseline will be excluded  
• Exclusion criteria #3 about vernal conjunctivitis is amended  
Rationale: To exclude the subject with any history of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and Atopic 
keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) for patients’ safety because these diseases are recurrent or chronic 
allergic inflamma tory disease of the ocular surface  
• Exclusion criteria #3 about viral serology screening is updated  
Rationale: To exclude the subject with positive HIV serology at screening 
• Exclusion criteria #3 is amended to exclude subjects with alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years 
before screening  
Rationale:  Recent history of Alcohol or drug abuse may make a subject’s participation unreliable 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 22 of 93 
or may interfere with study assessments  
• Included statement regarding analysis of neutralizing antibodies in cases where a nti-drug antibody 
assessment is positive  
Rationale: Was not previously noted in the protocol  
• Replacement of the SCORAD scale used for the study  
Rationale: The licensed image is not an adult.  Even though the image is an adolescent/child, the 
licensed ima ge will now be used 
• Pruritis Numeric rating Scale (P -NRS) is updated to now use validated Peak Pruritis Numeric 
Rating Scale (PP -NRS)  
Rationale: To match the licensed version  
• Amendment of Early Termination (ET) visit to specify additional posttreatment follow -up period 
visits should be requested for ET subjects if appropriate and to add the definition  of subjects lost to 
follow-up. 
Rationale: To ensure the ET subjects w ill be followed up appropriately. To highlight all reasonable 
efforts mu st be made to contact [CONTACT_12521].  
• Update AE/SAE causality discussions to eliminate “unlikely”, “possibly” and “probably” and only 
retain “related” or “not related”  
Rationale: Simplify and align with CDISC 
• Update A E/SAE collection periods to include any AEs/SAEs occurring from the time of subject 
signing of Informed Consent through the end of study  
Rationale: Collection periods were previously inconsistent between AE and SAE, and updated 
intent to collect both types of Ae s similarly  
• Added text to “SAE Collection” section to include collection of any SAEs after the end of the study period which have a reasonable possibility, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of being related to the investigational drug 
Rationale: En sure collection of SAEs that have a potential to be related to the investigational drug 
after the end of the study 
• Amendment of AD flare and rescue treatment to add specific instructions and recommendation s 
about the rescue treatment for AD flare  
Rationale: Due to the potential impact of re scue treatment on efficacy assessment, this section is 
amended to further clarify the permitted rescue TCS for AD flare treatment, and specify that the 
initiation of any other rescue treatment including other topi[INVESTIGATOR_12452] , systemic 
rescue treatment would lead to the study treatment discontinuation.  
• Added TCM or Herbal medications, allergen immunotherapy and live (attenuated vaccine), etc. 
to the prohibited concomitant treatment 
Rationale: Concomitant treatment of TCM or herbal medications, allergen immunotherapy, etc. 
may interfere with study efficacy and safety assessments 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 23 of 93 
• Change the wording of some secondary study endpoints and add “ Proportion of subjects achieving 
≥ 4-point reduction i n weekly average of PP -NRS” as an efficacy endpoint  
Rationale: For clarification and consistency.  
• Added “peripheral eosinophil counts” to PD assessment description 
Rationale: Was previously inadvertently not included 
• Added to footnote of Table [ADDRESS_11932]. 
Rationale: Was previously inadvertently not included. 
• Added text to “AD Flares” section to address rescue treatment descriptions  
Rationale: Was previously not included.  
• “Study Restrictions” section was updated to include several items 
Rationale: To be consistent with the changes made in the concomitant medication section.  
• “Study Treatment Accountability” section was updated to allow for on- site destruction (at clinical 
trial sites) of investigational drug  
Rationale: To simplify investigational drug mana gement  
• “Treatment Compliance” section was amended  
Rationale: To clarify how accountability of investigational drug will be managed and also to clarify 
that subjects will not have direct access to investigational drug.  
• Section for “Height and Body Weight” w as added  
Rationale: To help clarify when these assessments are made  
• “Physical Exam” section was amended  
Rationale: To include reference to management of ocular surface findings.  
• Amendment of Pregnancy section.   
Rationale: To clarify the pregnancy report procedure and follow up requirement. To Specify the 
pregnancy outcomes that should be considered as SAEs and that should follow the SAEs reporting 
procedure 
• Removed requirement for replacing subjects who had discontinued or had been discontinued prior to co mpletion of Week 4  
Rationale: It is determined that the enrollment plan negates this requirement, as enough subjects 
will be enrolled to allow for appropriate analysis of collected data  
• Amendment of Previous Human Experience section regarding Study CBP-201AU002  
Rationale: To supplement with the currently available results from Study CBP -201AU002 
• Amendment of Missing data section  
Rationale: To correct that subjects without efficacy data at a specific time point will be considered 
as non-responders is  applicable for analysis of binary efficacy endpoints.

5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background  
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects millions of patients 
worldwide. AD usually presents in childhood, most commonly  in infancy with two -thirds 
presenting by [CONTACT_654] 2 years, but AD also may be delayed until later in life  (8). However, a recent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based study in China reported that out of 2662 patients, 77.5% had onset of disease after 
12 years of age ( 9).  It affects 15% -20% of children ( 8) but is seen less commonly  in adults 
(point prevalence 1.6-11.5% but with wide variability from country to country) ( 1, 10) . Among 
other bothersome symptoms, AD is characterized by [CONTACT_12522] ( 11). Sleep disturbance, unrelenting pruritis and social embarrassment can lead to 
depress ion and other psychological disturbances ( 12, 13, 14, 15, 16).  
The pathophysiology of AD is complex and involves an interplay of skin barrier function, genetics, environmental factors and immune responses. Skin barrier function in AD is reduced and transdermal water loss is increased.  Localized inflammation and trauma from scratching can 
lead to further breakdown in barrier function and infection ( 17, 18, 19, 20). A family history of 
atopy is strongly associated with development of AD, as are loss of function mutations in the 
filaggrin gene ( 21). With respect to the immunologic disturbances, excessive T -cell activation 
with infiltration of the skin by T- cells and dendritic cells is a hallmark of AD  (20). T-helper 
cytokines including interleukin (IL)- 4, IL -5, IL -[ADDRESS_11938] been linked to the 
pathophysiology of AD ( 22). Therapy directed against cytokines is an area of active research and 
drug development ( 23). 
Diagnosis of AD is made on clinical grounds and guidelines for diagnosis, such as the Hanafin and Rajka criteria, have been utilized in clinical and research settings (1). The Hanafin and Rajka 
criteria require a combination of major criteria (e.g. pruritis, chronic dermatitis and history of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/cutaneous allergy) and minor criteria (e.g. facial pallor, infraorbital darkening, environmental or food triggers) to establish the diagnosis of AD. No specific laboratory or tissue histopathologic findings have been identified, but AD is sometimes associated with elevated 
immunoglobin E levels and eosinophilia ( 24, 25, 26) . 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450], such as moisturizers, emollients and corticosteroids are commonly used for 
treatment of AD  (27). Other topi[INVESTIGATOR_12455], 
antibiotics and phosphodiesterase inhibitors ( 28). There are limitations to the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_12456], application site reactions, application site restrictions and concerns about complications of long-term use (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors) ( 29). Systemic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_12457], steroids, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and others, however, inadequate efficacy as well as safety concerns such as adrenal suppression, Cushing’s Syndrome, 
organotoxicity and cancer risk are important limitations of available systemic therapy (30, 31, 
32). Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a mAb directed against IL-4 receptor alpha, was approved in the US for

treatment of moderate to severe AD in adults (2017) and adolescents (2019) when disease is not 
adequately controlled by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_12459]  
(33, 34, 35). See also, Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12460]® (dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]) Official HCP website ( 36). 
CBP -[ADDRESS_11939] IL- 4 receptor alpha. As 
with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], CBP-201 blocks signaling from both IL- 4 and IL -13, which are thought to play 
a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Preclinical work has demonstrated that CBP-201 has a desirable pharmacologic profile with high affinity and specificity for the target with greater 
potency and a longer half- life relative to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]. CBP -201 is being developed for treatment 
of AD initially, with plans to develop in other indications such as asthma and other inflammatory 
conditions. 
5.2. Physical, Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Properties  
The CBP -201 is recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds human interleukin-4 
receptor alpha (IL -4Rα), a common subunit of the interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 13 (IL- 13) 
receptor dimers. It is a human IgG4 containing a kappa light chain, with a predicted protein 
molecular weight of approximately [ADDRESS_11940] is supplied as a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale yellow liquid 
solution. The containers are 2 mL glass vials each containing 1.2 mL of 1 50 mg/mL of CBP -201 
drug substance in sterile solution for administration. The formulation of the CBP-201 solution contains excipi[INVESTIGATOR_12461] L-histidine, NaCl, Trehalose, and Tween 80. The placebo control solution contains the same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_12462]-201 drug substance. 
5.3. Preclinical Results  
Preclinical data demonstrates that CBP -201 has a desirable pharmacologic profile, including a 
high affinity and specificity for the antigen resulting in greater potency and a longer half- life 
when compared to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]. Extensive in vitro  studies characterizing the pharmacological 
properties of CBP-201 are reported. CBP-201 has a very high affinity for soluble recombinant Human IL -4Rα and inhibits the proliferation of erythroleukemic (TF- 1) cells. CBP -201 also 
inhibits IL -4- and IL -13-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) 
activation in Human embryonic kidney (HEK) -Blue
TMIL-4/IL-13 SEAP cells. In ex vivo  assays, 
CBP -201 inhibits IL-4- and IL-13-induced production of the chemokine thymus and activation 
regulated chemokine (TARC, also known as CCL17) and MDC (Human macrophage -derived 
chemokine [CCL22]) in Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These studies demonstrate CBP -[ADDRESS_11941] been 
studied in mice and monkeys with excellent dose proportionality observed across three dose levels, indicating good bioavailability.

Similar to other drugs in the same class (e.g., dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]), CBP-[ADDRESS_11942] with IL -
4Rα in preclinical species (mice, rats, monkeys). As such it was not possible to directly assess 
the toxicity of IL-4Rα inhibition by [CONTACT_12524]-[ADDRESS_11943] conducted a 4- week 
toxicology study in monkeys to assess the potential off- target toxicity of CBP -201 to support a 
single dose FIH study in healthy volunteers. In this study 4 weekly SC injections of CBP-201 into cynomolgus monkeys at 6, 40 and 200 mg/kg were well tolerated. The no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) of CBP -201 was 200 mg/kg, which corresponds to a C
max of 
approximately 6279 μg/mL and an area under the ti me concentration curve to the last measurable 
concentration (AUC last) of approximately 837.4 h*mg/mL at the last dose. There were no 
clinically meaningful changes in clinical observations, macroscopic observations, coagulation, clinical chemistry, hematology, lymphocytes changes, plasma complement and cytokine levels in 
the study. 
5.4. Previous Human E xperience  
5.4.1. Study CBP -201AU001 
A first -in-human single ascending dose study (Protocol CBP-201AU001) entitled “ A 
Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Single Ascending Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of CBP-201 Administered to Healthy Adult Subjects ” has been completed ( CSR CBP -201AU001). This was a single center, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose (SAD) study to assess the 
safety, tolerability, PK  and PD profile of CBP-201 administered subcutaneously (or IV for 
cohort 5) to healthy adults aged 18- [ADDRESS_11944] (IP) 
and 2 received placebo. Sentinel subjects (1 active:1 placebo) were used in Cohort 1 and for all 
dose escalations. Cohorts 1 through to 4 were administered study drug via the SC route. Cohort 5 
subjects received their assigned treatment via IV administration.  
The initial dose (Cohort 1) was a single administratio n of CBP-201 75 mg (or matching placebo).  
A sequential dose escalation (Cohorts 2-4) and additional cohort (Cohort 5) CBP-201 300 mg (or matching placebo) administered IV followed. Interim safety reviews by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) prior to proceeding to the next cohort were conducted. The dose levels per Cohort were as follows: 
Cohort 1:  75 mg or matching placebo via SC administration 
Cohort 2: 150 mg or matching placebo via SC administration Cohort 3: 300 mg or matching placebo via SC administration Cohort 4: 600 mg or matching placebo via SC administration

CONFIDENTIAL          Page 32 of 93 
Cohort 5: 300 mg or matching placebo via IV administration 
The study consisted of a Screening Period (up to 30  days), a Baseline Visit (Day -1 to 1), and 
nine additional follow-up visits over the following 85±[ADDRESS_11945] adverse events (AEs), assess vital signs (VS) 
and perform post-injection 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECGs), and to collect blood for PK and PD analysis. Subjects were discharged from the clinic on Day 2. Follow- up visits were 
conducted on Days 4, 8, 11, 15, 22±2 days, 29±2 days, 43±2 days, 57±2 days and 85±2 days.  The final planned study visit occurred on Day 85±2.  
A total of [ADDRESS_11946] to follow-up. C BP-201 appeared 
to be safe and well tolerated when administered to healthy male and female adult volunteers at SC doses from 75 mg up to 600 mg and following 300 mg administered IV. These conclusions were b ased on the following findings from all 40 treated subjects: 
• There were no SAEs, life -threatening TEAEs or deaths reported on study. 
• There were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study. 
• The majority of TEAEs were mild, 16 of the 86 (18.6%) TEAEs that occurred were moderate and there were no severe TEAEs. The severity of TEAEs and treatment -related 
TEAEs did not increase with increasing CBP-201 dose level nor was severity of TEAEs associated with a particular route of administration (SC compared to  IV delivery).  
• The incidence of TEAEs and treatment -related TEAEs was equivalent or lower for 
CBP -201- treated subjects compared to placebo -treated subjects and did not increase with 
increasing CBP -[ADDRESS_11947] 1 TEAE, 24 (80.0%) of which were treated with CBP-201 and 7 (70.0%) of which received placebo.  Across all treatment groups, [ADDRESS_11948] 1 treatment -related TEAE, 11 (36.7%) of which received CBP-201 and 5 (50.0%) of 
which received placebo  
• The most common TEAEs and treatment- related TEAEs were headache and upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (URTI), which occurred with similar frequency in the All 
CBP -201 and All Placebo groups. 
• There were no clinically s ignificant and/or study drug-related changes in vital signs, ECG 
parameters, or physical examination findings. Two (2) injection site reactions (ISRs) 
occurred in 2 SC CBP- 201 treated subjects which were reported as AEs. There were no 
ISRs reported as AEs for subjects receiving placebo. Both were deemed to be mild in 
severity and resolved.  Injection site reactions did not occur with 300 mg IV 
administration of CBP -201. Regardless of treatment assignment or SC CBP-201 dose 
level administered, there were no occurrences of injection site reactions greater than Grade 1.

Pharmacokinetics: The exposure to CBP-201 after SC administration increased in a dose- related 
but greater than dose-proportional manner, suggesting a nonlinear component to clearance. 
Comparing 300 mg SC and IV doses, the absolute bioavailability after SC administration was 
58% and the median time to last detectable drug ranged from 338 hours at 75 mg to 1345 hours 
at 600 mg. 
Pharmacodynamics: Single SC doses of 75 mg to 600 mg of CBP-201 significantly reduced 
plasma TARC levels. Comparable decreases are observed for all four SC doses and for the IV 
dose. Overall, the relationship between the percent change in TARC and plasma CBP-201 was 
relatively flat across the range of plasma concentrations in this small single dose study.   
5.4.2. Study CBP -201AU002 
A follow-on study (Protocol CBP-201AU002) entitled: “ A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-
Controlled, Multiple Ascending Dose Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary 
Efficacy of CBP -201 in Patients with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis ” has been 
completed  (Clinical Study Report is still in the process of development)  at the time of this 
protocol. This study is a 12 -week, double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, multi- center, 
multi-national, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to assess the safety, PK profile and 
preliminary efficacy of treatment with CBP -201 in subjects with moderate to severe AD. The 
primary objective of this study was to ass ess the safety and tolerability of multiple subcutaneous 
(SC) doses of CBP -201 in patients with moderate to severe AD. 
This study was conducted at 9 study sites in Australia and 4 in New Zealand . Subjects were 
randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive CBP-201 or placebo once a week for 4 doses, with 
approximately 10 patients (8 active:2 placebo) randomized in each dose cohort. Three ascending dose levels were  planned (75, 150 and300 mg CBP-201). All dose escalations wer e subject to 
Safety Review Committee blinded review.  The treatment period was  4 weeks in duration. 
Subjects  were followed for an additional 8 weeks for safety, efficacy and to further characterize 
the PK and PD profile of CBP-201.   
A total of 86 subjects were screened and 32 subjects with moderate to severe AD (ages 20 – 65) 
were enrolled and randomized with [ADDRESS_11949] who was withdrawn from the study on Day 1 following randomization but prior to dosing. The  study result s are listed 
as following: 
Efficacy:  Administration of CBP -201 for 4 weeks resulted in rapid improvements in EASI, IGA, 
and 
Pruritis Numeric Rating Scale ( P-NRS ) at all doses above the lowest dose (75 mg). On Day 
29, 87.5% (7/8) of patients in the 150mg group had a 50% reduction in the EASI score (EASI-
50) while 100% (7/7) of patients in the 300 mg group achieved EASI-50 versus 37.5% (3/8) in 
the placebo  group. For IGA, 50.0% (4/8) of patients in the 150 mg group, 42.9% (3/7) of patients 
in the 300 mg group, and only 12.5% (1/8) in the placebo  group had an IGA score of 0 to 1 
(clear, almost clear). Average weekly P -NRS in severity decreased by 41.0% in the CBP-201 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 34 of 93 
150 mg group, by 52.8% in the 300 mg group versus 22.8% in the placebo  group. P- NRS 
response rates (>3 -point decrease) were greater for the 150  mg (50%, 4/8) and 300 mg groups 
(57%, 4/7) versus the placebo  group (25%, 2/8) on Day 29. 
Safety: CBP -[ADDRESS_11950] one dose of CBP-201 and 8 of 8 patients in the placebo group. 
• There were no SAEs, life-threatening TEAEs, or deaths reported on study.  
• There were no TEAEs leading to the discontinuation from the study. 
• The majority of TEAEs were mild. The number and severity of TEAEs and treatment 
related TEAEs did not increase with increasing CBP-201 dose level. Of 51 TEAEs 
reported across the pooled CBP-201 group, 9 events were deemed by [CONTACT_12525], and 3 of 11 TEAEs in the placebo group were deemed related to 
placebo treatment. There was no treatment related severe TEAEs reported.  
• The most common Adverse Events (AE) during the study were exacerbation of AD (26.1% in the combined CBP -201 group and 37.5% in placebo group), headache, and 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. 
• By [CONTACT_12526]-201 treatment groups, there were no apparent differences 
between the different dosing groups in terms of study treatment related TEAEs.  
• There were no clinical ly significant injection site reactions that were reported as AEs  
• There were no clinically significant and/or study drug-related changes in vital signs, ECG parameters, or physical examination findings. 
• Immunogenicity assay results showed 5 of 23 patients (21.7%) had a treatment-induced 
positive response for ADA with very low titration. Overall, the immunogenicity of CBP 201 varied inversely with the CBP-201 dose, with the incidence of treatment-induced ADA positive response observed to decrease with greater CBP 201 doses.  
Pharmacokinetic: The highest CBP-201 concentrations were observed approximately one week 
(Day 29) after the fourth CBP -201 administration on Day 22. The median t1/2 was 
approximately 10 days for the CPB-201 150 mg to 300 mg groups. Dose proportionality assessed 
based on AUC
0-t and C max, showed that an increase in exposure was greater than proportional as 
the dose increased from 75 mg to 150 mg, and proportional when the dose increased from 150 
mg to 300 mg. 
Pharmacodynamics: CBP -201 at the 150 mg and 300 mg doses resulted in a steady decline of 
serum TARC and LDH.

CBP -201 is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds human interleukin-4 receptor alpha 
(IL-4Rα), a common subunit of the interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 13 (IL -13) receptor 
dimers. CBP-201 blocks signaling from both IL- 4 and IL -13 which are thought to play a role in 
the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD).  CBP-201 is administered as a subcutaneous (SC) 
injection.  This study is designed to test various CBP-201 dosing regimens  over an extended 
period in subjects with AD.

vials to result in approximately 300 mg CBP-201, and for 600 mg, 1 mL is to be withdrawn 
from each of 4 vials to result in approximately 600 mg. Similarly, for the placebo dose, 1 mL is to be withdrawn from each of 2 vials to result in the equivalent volume to the 300 mg CBP-201 dose, and for 600 mg, 1 mL is withdrawn from each of 4 vials. For the 150 mg CBP-201 dose, in order to maintain the blind, 1 mL is to be withdrawn from each of a CBP-201 vial and a 
placebo vial to deliver the same volume as a 300 mg CBP-201 dose.
 
7.1.1. Screening Period  (Day  -45 [D -45] to D-1):   
After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility at an initial 
screening visit within 45 days before the baseline visit. Medical history, physical examination 

Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 38 of 93 
(including height and weight), concomitant medication review, cl inical laboratory tests, 
including tests for HIV and hepatitis, and a 12-lead ECG will be obtained during this period. A 
blood pregnancy test will be obtained for all women of child-bearing potential.   
See Table 1  for details on the procedures to be completed during Screening.   
Subjects  will also be instructed to apply a bland emollient twice a day to affected areas  for the 
duration of the study (investigators are free to recommend the preferred bland emollient for 
subject use and the cost  will be reimbursed  by [CONTACT_1034]). To allow for assessment of dryness 
and scaling, emollients should be avoided during the [ADDRESS_11951] be reviewed by [CONTACT_12506] (D1) to confirm eligibility.  
AD severity and impact will be assessed as follows: 
By [CONTACT_423]: 
• Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (P P-NRS): a single self -reported item designed to 
measure peak pruritus or ‘worst’ itch, over the previous 24 h based on the following 
question: ‘on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being “no itch” and 10 being “worst itch imaginable’, 
how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours ?” (37). See 
Section 16.1, Appendix A . The PP-NRS (daily itch diary) will be distributed at start of 
Screening and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_12519] (D1). Instruct the subject 
to complete the daily PP- NRS (daily itch diary) for the 7 days prior to the Baseline Visit to 
calculate the subjects ’ baseline average score. Subsequently, the daily PP- NRS  will be 
captured for each day (24 hours previous). 
• Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI): a 10-item questionnaire assessing the impact of 
AD on quality of life (QOL) over the past week, with an overall scoring of 0 (absent 
disease) to 30 (severe disease); higher scores indicative of poorer QOL. See Section 16.2, 
Appendix B. 
• Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM):  a 7-item questionnaire assessing disease 
symptoms on a 0 to 4 scale (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and 
weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) with a scoring system of 0 (absent disease) to 28 (severe disease); higher scores indicative of poorer quality of life. See Section 
16.3, Appendix C . 
By [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator:  
•  Investigators Global Assessment (IGA): Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic 
Dermatitis (vIGA -AD™ ) scale  is a 5-point categorical scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = 
mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on the overall appearance of the lesions at a given time point.  Note that to qualify for eligibility, the IGA score must be ≥ 3. See Section 
16.4, 
Appendix D . Note also that IGA -1 should not include scaling or induration. To allow for 
assessment of dryness and scaling, emollients should be avoided during the 4 hours prior to evaluation. 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 39 of 93 
• Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI): EASI score measures the severity and extent of AD 
and erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: 
head/neck, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 
(minimum) to 72 (maximum) points; higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. Note that to qualify for eligibility, the EASI score must be ≥ 16. See Section 16.5, Appendix E . 
• Percent body surface area (BSA) of AD involvement with maximum percentages for each 
region using the “rule of nines”: head and neck [9%], anterior trunk [18%], back [18%], 
upper limbs [18%], lower limbs [36%], and genitals [1%]. The number of handprints of AD 
skin in a body region can be used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region is 
involved with AD. The area represented by [CONTACT_12503]'s hand with all 
five digits adducted together, is approximately 1% of the subject's BSA, regardless of the 
subject's age. Handprints across various body regions assessed is used to calculate BSA % of 
AD involvement. Note that to qualify for eligibility, the BSA % score for AD involvement 
must be ≥ 10. See Section 16.6, Appendix F . 
• Severity scoring of AD (SCORAD): a clinical tool for assessing the severity 
(extent/intensity) of AD and subjective signs/symptoms (e.g. pruritus/insomnia). The extent of lesions is scored by [CONTACT_12527]. The intensity is determined by [CONTACT_12528] 6 items on a scale from 0 to 3 (erythema, edema, oozing/crusting, excoriations, 
lichenification and dryness). Each item is be scored on the most representative area for a given intensity item. See Section 
16.7, Appendix G . To allow for assessment of dryness and 
scaling, emollients should be avoided during the 4 hours prior to evaluation. 
7.1.2. D1: Baseline  and Study Treatment Administration  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prior to Subcutaneous Injection of Study Treatment  
Subjects who meet the selection criteria at the Screening Visit and are eligible to participate in the study will be required to return to the study center within 45 day s of Screening.  The 
following assessments will be performed  (see the Baseline pre-dose procedures as detailed in the 
Schedule of Events, Table 1 ): 
• Confirm informed consent and eligibility for study participation (note this may require an updated medical history) 
• 
Review the PP-NRS daily diary for completion, confirmation that a bland emollient has been 
applied to affected areas for at least 7 days before the baseline visit  
• Document any new or changed concomitant medications  
• Document any AE s  
• Document vital signs (VS).  Note that subjects should be seated and rested for at least 3 minutes prior to assessing VS 
• Obtain ECG and Safety labs (CBC, chemistry, UA), PK, PD and ADA samples , urine 
pregnancy test 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 40 of 93 
• Repeat Investigator AD assessments (IGA, EASI, BSA and SCORAD) and Subject 
PROs ( complete patient reported outcomes DLQI and POEM ; review PP-NRS  diaries 
with subject) 
• Randomize to study treatment  regimen   
• Instruct subject to continue applying the bland emollient twice daily to affected areas, 
schedule when to return for the next visit. Remind the subject to complete t he daily PP-
NRS (daily itch diary) and perform required study procedures 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subcutaneous Administration of Study Treatment  
Injections will be administered by [CONTACT_12529]. Further details are 
provided in the CBP -201 Pharmacy Manual. On D1, subjects will receive injections from 4 vials 
of either CBP -201 or placebo. Study treatment will be administered SC using aseptic technique.  
SC injection s when 4 vials are to be administered  will generally be performed at two  or more 
injection site s in the abdomen (avoid the area proximal to the umbilicus), lateral thigh or upper 
arm (lateral or posterolateral ). Injection sites  should be rotated for future injections.   
Document the time that the study treatment injection is completed  (T0). VS (temperature, blood 
pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_12463]) should be obtained hourly (T1h and T2h) post injection.  
Note that subjects  should be seated and rested for at least 3  minutes prior to  assessing VS.  
Prior to discharge from the site, assess injection sites for any reaction.  The use of the Injection 
Site Assessment form (see Section 16.8, Appendix H ) may be helpful to the Investigator to 
standardize injection site responses (note all clinically significant findings should be considered 
AEs).  
Note: upon discharge of the participants after each dose, i t is important to instruct subjects on 
actions to t ake if any signs and symptoms of delayed severe allergic reactions such as 
anaphylaxis occur. 
Additionally, instruct the subject to continue the twice daily emollient applications on affected 
areas, when to return for the next visit and to perform required study procedures. The daily itch 
diary should be completed each day throughout the study. Should an AD flare occur, the subject 
should notify the site for acceptable topi[INVESTIGATOR_12464].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. AD Flares  and Rescue Treatment  
AD is a chr onic relapsing skin condition that is characterized by [CONTACT_12530]. Many flare definitions rely on a physician’s assessment or subject report (38), however a relatively recent review suggests that an escalation of treatment (or 
rescue) and days of topi[INVESTIGATOR_11977] (TCS) use were good indicators of flare and flare duration ( 39).  Therefore , when an AD flare occurs, its onset and duration will be 
documented as an AE by [CONTACT_12509](s) of flare involvement . If the Investig ator determin es 
that the flare is severe enough to merit  “rescue” treatment, document the choice of TCS and 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May [ADDRESS_11952] 
need not be discontinued in this situation. Permitted TCS medications to treat AD flares may 
include the following:  
• Cream based preparations or lotion in hair bearing areas  
• Low to moderate potency TCS (WHO classification  Ⅶ-Ⅳ ) equivalent to class VII – Ⅳ 
according to the U.S classification are allowed. The TCS regimen will be adjusted to the 
flare activity and tolerability by [CONTACT_423], and stopped when lesions are cleared.  
o Examples:  
 Methylprednisolone acetate 0.1% 
 Mometasone furoate 0.1%  
 Betamethasone valerate cream 0.1% 
• If possible, Investigators should attempt to limit the first step of rescue therapy to permitted TCS rescue treatment  and escalate to systemic medications only for patients 
who do not respond adequately after the treatment of permitted TCS.   
If a patient receives any other rescue treatment inclu ding other topi[INVESTIGATOR_12465] 
(apart from  permitted TCS and bland emollients ), systemic corticosteroids or nonsteroidal 
systemic immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs  (cyclosporine, methotrexate, 
mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, Janus kinase inhibitors, biologic agents, etc), the study 
treatment will be immediately discontinued.  In this situation, subjects should remain in the 
study and continue with study procedures (complete the schedule of study visits and 
assessments)  but will not receive additional study drug administration. 
Investigators should make every attempt to conduct efficacy and safety assessments (eg, 
disease severity scores, safety labs) immediately before administering any rescue treatment. An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose if necessary.

7.2. Discussion of Study Design ; Randomization and Blinding  
This trial is designed to determine the efficacy of study treatment (C BP-201 vs. placebo) injected 
SC in treating adult moderate to severe AD.   
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics and baseline characteristics) or other variables are evenly balanced across treatm ent groups, and to enhance 
the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups.  
A placebo control will be used to establish the frequency and magnitude of changes in clinical endpoints that may occur in the absence of active treatment as well as to minimize subject and investigator bias. Double-blinded treatments will be used to reduce potential bias of subjects and 
investigators during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints.  
Treatment group assignments will be double-blinded during the study. The subject, 
investigational site personnel, Sponsor, and Sponsor designees directly involved in the conduct and/or monitoring of this study will not be aware of the treatment group assignments. In the PK portion of the study all participating subjects whether randomized to active or placebo will have 
blood drawn at the specified time points and sent to the bioanalytical laboratory for subsequent 
processing. As no one at the site is unblinded as to which treatment group any subject is assigned , blinding is preserved with PK sampling. 
Under normal circumstances, the blind will not be broken until all participants have completed 
the study. In case of emergency, and only if the information is required by [CONTACT_12534]’s safety  in managing a medical condition, the treatment may be unblinded at the 
site by [CONTACT_2329] a code break module. The code break module will be provided by [CONTACT_1034] ’s 
designee. If possible, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_12535]. Whenever a treatment sequence is prematurely unblinded, the reason, date and time of the unblinding, and the individual who broke the blind must be documented. Individual code breaks will result in withdrawal of the participant from the study. 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May [ADDRESS_11955] meet all of the following criteria to be considered eligible to participate in the 
study: 
1) Be an adult ≥18 and ≤ 75 years of age at the screening visit (Screening) with atopic

4) Women  must not be pregnant, planning to become pregnant or breast-feed during the study. 
8.3. Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment  
A subject is free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the study at any time for 
any reas on. A subject’s participation must therefore be terminated immediately upon his/her 
request, and the reason(s) for discontinuation appropriately documented. A subject may be 
discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• At the request of the Sponsor, regulatory agency, or IRB /IEC  
• Subject is lost to follow -up 
• Subject treatment allocation is unblinded (i.e., individual code break) 
• Death of subject 
• A subject may also be discontinued from the study, at the discretion of the Investigator 
and/or Sponsor, for any of the following reasons:  
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May [ADDRESS_11956] refuses or is unable to adhere to the study protocol 
o Major protocol violation 
o Pregnancy  
o Use of unacceptable concomitant medication(s)  
o It is not considered in the best interest of the subject to continue 
o Administrative reasons (e.g., termination of enrollment or study) 
The Investigator must maintain a record of all subjects who discontinue from the study prior to completion; the reason(s) for study discontinuation will be documented. If a subject chooses to 
withdraw from the study, the Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to obtain and record 
the reason(s) for withdrawal in as much detail as possible, although the subject is not obligated to provide such a reason.  
If a subject is discontinued while at the clinical site, the early termination procedures should be 
performed prior to discharge from the clinical site. The investigator should ask the subject to participate in f ollow-up procedures, provided that the subject has not withdrawn consent for such  
procedures. If the subject refuses to complete early termination/ follow-up procedures or 
continued data collection, this information will be recorded. 
8.4. Study  Restrictions  
In addition to the criteria described in Section  8.[ADDRESS_11957] agree to 
abide by [CONTACT_12536]. Of course,  the Investigator is permitted to use clinical discretion 
for required concomitant medications  or treatments  to treat an AE .

or investigational drugs) taken by [CONTACT_12539] 30 days prior to Screening will be 
recorded in the source documentation as medication history and in the database in the Prior and 
Concomitant Medications section . Similarly,  any treatments received will be recorded in the 
source documentation as medication history. 
Any new medications/treatments during the study will be recorded in source documentation and 
captured in the appropriate case report form. 
10.2.4. Height and Body Weight  
Height (cm) and body weight (Kg, in indoor clothing without shoes) will be determined at time 
points according to Schedule of Events (Table 1 ).

It is the responsibility of the Investigator to review and sign all lab reports expeditiously, and to 
document appropriate safety monitoring of study subjects. The Investigator should sign and date 
each lab report concurrent with her or his review, and should indicate the clinical significance of each abnormal/flagged value by [CONTACT_12542] “NCS” (not clinical ly significant) or “CS” (clinically 
significant), for example. Notations indicating that a value is clinically significant should also 
include a brief description of the underlying disease or condition that is associated with the 
value, e.g., “CS/mild anem ia.”  In general, and as determined by [CONTACT_093], abnormal, 
clinically significant laboratory values are expected to be associated with an item recorded in medical history or with an AE. The investigator may use the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 (published November 27, 2017 and available at: 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R

IL-13, IgE, and TARC and peripheral eosinophil counts.   
10.4.4. ADA Sampling 
ADA sampling will be performed according to the Schedule of Events ( Table 1 ).  The ADA 
serum sample may be taken from the PD sample.  All samples that are positive in the ADA assay will 
be further tested for the presence of anti-CBP -201 neutralizing antibody ( Nab).

11. ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
11.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or increase in severity of a preexisting abnormality, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered 
related to t he medicinal (investigational) product. A “suspected adverse reaction ” means any AE 
for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. “Reasonable 
possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event.   
11.1.1. AE Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such an 
assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally, the facts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. The relationship of each AE to 
study medication will be assessed using the following categories:  
 
Causality 
Category  Descri ption  
Related   
An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the course after withdrawal of the drug), or for 
which possible involvement of the drug cannot be ruled out, although 
factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible. 
Not related   
An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/or that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments.  
 
If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, 
then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by [CONTACT_456]. If the investigator cannot determine the etiology of the event but 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May [ADDRESS_11962] in the determination of severity and 
clinical significance . The following represents CTCAE grading of AE severity: 
• Grade 1 / Mild : asymptomatic or mild symptoms or clinical or diagnostic observations only 
or intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2 / Moderate:  minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated or limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  (ADLs) . Instrumental ADLs refe r to 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money etc. 
• Grade 3 / Severe or Medically Significant But Not Immediately Life -threatening : 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12474] l imiting self-care 
ADLs . Self -care ADLs refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications and not bedridden. 
• Grade 4 / Life Threatening  Consequences : urgent intervention indicated. 
• Grade 5 / Death Related to AE . 
 
AEs not listed by [CONTACT_12544]: 
• Grade 1 / Mild : discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity. 
• Grade 2 / Moderate: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity.  
• Grade 3 / Severe: inability to work or perf orm normal daily activity.  
• Grade 4 / Life Threatening : represents an immediate threat to life.  
• Grade 5 / Death  
11.1.3. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE or reaction is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes: 
 Death  
 Is life -threatening (at the time of the event)  
 Requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in an offspring) 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 61 of 93 
 An Important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or develop ment 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12476] (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12477], or any prolongation of an existing admission. An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, the event leading to the emergency room 
visit is assessed for medical importance. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12478] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_12479]. Examples in clude:
 
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a 
new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (e.g., for workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory abnormality) 
• Administrative admission ( e.g., for yearly physical examination);  
• Protocol-specified admission during a study (e.g., for a procedure required by [CONTACT_4690]) 
• Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] ( e.g., for elective 
cosmetic surgery)  
• Elective hospit alization, e.g., preplanned treatments or surgical procedures. These should be 
noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject 
 
11.1.4. General Guidelines for AE Reporting  
Collection of AEs and SAEs will commence from the time the subject signs the informed 
consent to participate in the study and continue until the end of the study. All AEs must be entered on the corresponding pages of the CRF, regardless of causality or severity. AEs include 
new AEs, worsening baseline conditions, clinically significant laboratory findings, disease-
related signs and symptoms that were not present at baseline, and any events or findings that the Investigator feels are clinically significant.  
Information collected concerning AEs will include the following: 
 Name [CONTACT_12581]  (whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported 
instead of symptoms) 
 Start  date 
 Stop date 
 Severity (i.e., mild, moder ate, severe, potentially life -threatening, death) 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 62 of 93 
 Relationship to study treatment (related, not related)  
 Action taken with the study treatment (dose not changed, drug interrupted, drug 
withdrawn, not applicable, unknown) 
 Outcome (recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, not recovered/not resolved, resolved 
with sequelae, fatal, unknown) 
 Seriousness of event (SAE or non- SAE)  
Pretreatment AEs are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject who has signed informed consent to participate in a study but prior to administration of 
any study medication; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study participation.  Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that developed or 
worsened during the treatment- emergent period. The treatment -emergent period is from first 
administration of study treatment to end of the follow -up period. Pre -existing conditions (present 
at the time of signing of informed consent) are considered concurrent medical conditions and should not be recorded as AEs unless they worsen in severity or increase in frequency. Screening  
evaluation  findings ( e.g., laboratory tests, ECG, etc.) should not be recorded as P retreatment AE s 
unless related to study procedures.   
The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery is 
complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, 
or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the subjec ts. This may imply that observations will 
continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_12545]. Subjec ts who experience an 
ongoing SAE or an AESI, at the prespecified study end-date, should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death and related data will be collected.  
When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the subject ’s observations will continue until the 
end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_12546] . 
Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities 
should be recorded as AEs when any of the following 
conditions are met:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of any protocol-specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy; and/or  
• Test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_4687].  
11.1.5. AE of Special Interest  
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 63 of 93 
sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by [CONTACT_12547]. Such events may require further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may be added or removed 
during a study by [CONTACT_12548]. 
Ophthalmic complications are well known to complicated severe AD with incidence rates of 32-
56% ( 2, 3, 6). Nonetheless, conjunctivitis and keratitis have been subjects of interest in the 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12441]. In Akinlade, the authors reported that in the combined dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12480] (n=1047) there were a total of 90 (8.6%) of patients reporting at least one AE of 
“conjunctivitis” while those patients in the placebo group (n=517) reported 11 (2.1%) such 
events. Conjunctivitis AEs were mostly mild to moderate in severity with severe events reported 
in ≤ 0.5% of the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12481]. ≤ 0.3% of the placebo group. Two patients in the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12482] a conjunctivitis event. Onset 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_12483] 4-[ADDRESS_11963] be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of knowledge of the event , 
if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to sponsor/CRO must be made immediately, 
irrespective of the extent of available event information.  The procedure for reporting an SAE is as 
follows: 
 All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of discovery) by [CONTACT_12549] :  
24/[ADDRESS_11964]: [PHONE_221] (US toll- free: 1 -[PHONE_222]) 
SAE Reporting email: safety -[EMAIL_207]  
 The initial report should include all information known at the time of the report (additional 
information can be reported as discovered). Do not delay the initial reporting in order to obtain resolution or follow-up information. 
 The site will report SAE(s) by [CONTACT_12550] a SAE  Report F orm, which is provided by 
[CONTACT_3211] /CRO.
 In general, this will include a description of the adverse event in sufficient detail 
to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality. Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May [ADDRESS_11965] be provided. SAE Report Form will include the following information, as 
available:  
o Subject ID  
o Country where event occurred 
o Event Information 
o List of relevant test results and laboratory data  
o Any other relevant history 
o Whether the study treatment was discontinued 
o Investigator’s assessment of causality  
The CRO Medical  Monitor or CRO designee / Sponsor designee may contact [CONTACT_12551]. All SAEs will be 
entered on the AE CRF. The same nomenclature should be used on both the SAE report form and the AE CRF. The Investigator is responsible for the complete and timely reporting of all SAEs to the Sponsor (or designee), reporting pertinent follow-up information on the SAE, and 
notifying the appropriate IRB /IEC  of the occurrence of and details surrounding the event in 
accordance with local regulations. In the event there is a question as to whether the AE is 
serious, the event should be reported. 
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the 
subject  and considered by [CONTACT_12552]/her to be caused by [CONTACT_12553] a reasonable 
possibility, should be reported to the monitoring team or sponsor/designee within [ADDRESS_11966] be discontinued from further study treatment dosing and monitored until resolution or stabilization.  
11.3. Pregnancy  
All subjec ts who participate in the study should be counseled on the need to practice adequate 
birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation as detailed in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pregnancy testing will be conducted throughout the study, as detailed in the Schedule of Events ( Table 1 ). 
A subject  who is found to be pregnant at the screening visit or during the screening period will 
be excluded from the study and will be considered to be a s creening failure. If any subject who 
has been enrolled in the study is found to be pregnant during the study, the investigator must notify the CRO and sponsor/designee within [ADDRESS_11967]  should be withdrawn from the study and any study treatment should be immediately 
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May [ADDRESS_11968] be reported to  CRO and sponsor/designee by 
[CONTACT_12550] a Pregnancy Form irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred. Information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery. In the case of any pre gnancy in the partner 
of a male subject , the investigator must obtain permission from the subject's partner in order to 
collect any pregnancy information.  
The Investigator will be required to follow the pregnancy up to final outcome (completion or 
pregnancy termination, including perinatal or neonatal outcome up to 28 days after birth). T he 
outcome including any premature termination must be notified to CRO and reported to 
sponsor/designee using the Pregnancy F orm. An evaluation after the birth of the child will also be 
conducted. 
 Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical study is not considered to be an SAE, if the outcome 
of the pregnancy meets the criteria f or an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion includes 
miscarriage and missed abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in 
a live -born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.

12. DATA QUALITY ASSURAN CE 
This study will be conducted under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulatory 
requirements. To ensure compliance, the Sponsor or designee may conduct a quality assurance 
audit, as outlined in Section 12.2.  
Actions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study centers; the review of protocol procedures with the Investigator and study personnel prior to study start; the design of suitable source documents 
with appropriate instructions for use (where applicable); the internal audit of source data according to GCP and internal procedures to ensure their accuracy, compl eteness, and 
verifiability; as well as the periodic site monitoring by [CONTACT_1034]. The Sponsor or designee will review source documents for accuracy and completeness during on- site monitoring visits and 
after their return to the Sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the Investigator, as appropriate.  
Significant and/or repeated non- compliance will be investigated and remedial action instituted 
when appropriate. Failure to comply with remedial actions may result in investigational site 
terminatio n and regulatory authority notification. 
12.1. Data Collection  
Source documents include, but are not limited to, original documents, data and records such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/medical records (including electronic health records), clinic charts, lab results, participant  diaries, data recorded in automated instruments, microfilm or magnetic media, and 
pharmacy records, etc. This study will use electronic data capture (EDC). At a minimum, all data required by [CONTACT_12554].  
All CRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_12555]’s monitor or 
designated representative. The Sponsor’s monitor or designated representative will review all 
source records on- site and compare them to the da ta collected on the CRF. All entries, 
corrections, and alterations will be made by [CONTACT_12556]. All data entries will be verified for accuracy and correctness by [CONTACT_12557]. The 
electronic data capture sys tem maintains a full audit trail.  
12.2. Study Auditing and Monitoring  
Monitoring of the study site (including, but not limited to, reviewing CRFs for accuracy and 
completeness) will be performed by [CONTACT_1034]’s designated monitor(s). The extent, nature, and 
frequency of on-site visits will be based on such considerations as the study objectives and/or

endpoints, the purpose of the study, study design complexity, and enrollment rate. By [CONTACT_12558], the Investigator agrees that, within local regulatory restrictions and institutional and ethical considerations, authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, and/or 
an IRB /IEC  may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including the drug storage area, 
study treatment stocks, drug accountability records, participant charts and source documents, and 
other records related to study conduct. The purpose of the Sponsor audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study- related activities and documents to 
determine whether the study- related activities were conducted, and data recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, the site’s standard operating procedures, GCP guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_12559] a regulatory agency regarding an inspection.

13. STATISTICAL METHODS  
13.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
This section describes the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety. The 
final analysis will be documented in a formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that will be 
finalized before database lock. The SAP will include details on how variables will be derived, how missing data will be handled, and how data will be presented as well as the details on statistical methods to be used for safety and efficacy analyses. T he final clinical study report will 
discuss deviations from the SAP, if any. 
13.2. Sample Size Justification  
The first primary efficacy endpoint is percentage of reduction of EASI at week 16. While the final analysis is planned to be analysis of variance (SAS
® PROC MIXED for ANOVA)  with 
confounding covariates, for simplicity, the sample size is calculated using a simpler [ADDRESS_11969]. Based on the preliminary results  at week 4 and more empi[INVESTIGATOR_12484], the 
following input parameters were used for po wer and sample size calculation:  
Parameters : 
• Type I error (α) = 0.05 (two-sided) 
• The non-inferiority margin of 35% between the CBP -201 300 mg Q2W vs. P lacebo  
• Common standard deviation (σ) = 45% 
• Effective sample size: 44 per arm, after considering of 20% dropout rate from 55 
randomized per arm 
Hypotheses: 
H0: Δ CBP -201-300 mg Q2W  - Placebo  = 0 
H1: ΔCBP -201-300 mg Q2W  - Placebo  ≠ [ADDRESS_11970]: T wo-sample t-test for mean difference  
Based on method described above, a sample size of 220 (55 per arm, or effective sample size of 44 per arm considering 20% dropout rate) will provide 95% power to detect the treatment effect 
on the primary endpoint between the CBP-[ADDRESS_11971] dose (300 mg Q2W) to the 
lowest dose (150 mg dose Q2W), until statistical significance at 0.05 level is not achiev ed.  
13.3. Analysis Populations  
The following three analysis populations are planned for this study:  
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 69 of 93 
• All Subjects Screened (Screened) set will contain all subjects who signed informed consent. 
• All Randomized Set (Randomized) will contain all subjects who are randomized into the 
study, no matter whether they were treated or not. 
• The Safety Set (SS)  will include all randomized subjects who received at least part of an SC 
dose of study treatment. S S will be based on the actual treatment received .  
• The PK  Set (PKS) will include all randomized subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_11972] 1 PK sample collected and analyzable. 
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all randomized subjects who receive at least part of 
an SC dose of study treatment.  FAS will be based on the planned treatment received  (i.e., 
“as randomized”) . 
• The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will contain a subset of FAS subjects who do not have any major protocol deviations. 
  
All safety assessments and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the SS. PK analyses 
will be performed using the PKS. PD  and efficacy analyses will be performed using the FAS . PK 
and safety  analysis  will be based on the actual treatment received. PD and Efficacy analysis will 
be based on planned treatment received.  Each active dose cohort will be presented separately, 
along with a combined active dose group.  Membership in the analysis populations will be determined before unblinding. 
13.4. Planned Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the safety, efficacy, PK and PD data. Descriptive 
statistics will consist of the number of observations, the number of missing observations, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), standard error, minimum, median, and maximum. Demographic and 
baseline characteristics will be listed and summarized.  
13.5. Study Subjects and Demographics  
13.5.1. Disposition and Withdrawals 
The numbers of subjects who screen fail (along with the reason), who were randomized, complet ed the study, and withdr ew (ET) , along with reasons for ET , will be tabulated overall and 
by [CONTACT_1570].  The number of subjects in each analysis population will be reported. 
13.5.2. Protocol Deviations

summarized for each treatment group and for the overall population by [CONTACT_9086]. Medical history and screening clinical laboratory tests will be listed.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], by [CONTACT_12560], classified using World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (WHO ATC) classes and preferred terms.  
13.5.4. Exposure  
Since this is a repeat  dose study, study treatment administration will be summarized in terms of 
treatment regimen group (dose delivered over 16 weeks). 
13.5.5. General Considerations  
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] (as applicable) using the descriptive statistics n, mean, SD, median, and range (minimum, and maximum).  Categorical assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] (as applicable) using 
frequency counts and rates of occurrence (%). The formal statistical comparison will be 
performed on the primary efficacy endpoints only, while descriptive statistics, together with clopper- pearson exact confidence interval for ratios , will be provided.  All statistical tests will be 
conducted using 2-sided tests with 5% Type 1 error rates unless otherwise stated. The primary 
efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA, SAS PROC MIXED 
procedure) statistical method. P airwise comparisons for each treatment group vs. placebo will be 
performed and a serial gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_12446]. Changes 
from baseline for continuous outcomes could be presented as  their corresponding continuous 
measures for post -baseline visits , details will be provided in SAP. All study data used on table 
and figure generation, together with other clinical meaningful data, will be listed by [CONTACT_6490], subject and time point.  
13.6. Analysis of Efficacy Measures  
All continuous efficacy endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_6490]. The categorical efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_12561]. Change from baseline in efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed and 
graphically presented if appropriate.   
13.6.1. Analysis for primary efficacy endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be comparing percentage reduction in EASI from baseline to 
W16  for each CBP -201 regimen versus placebo .  
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May [ADDRESS_11973] of three hypotheses, which will be fully adjusted for 
multiplicity using a serial gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_12485] 5% level of significance as long as the 
previous hypothesis is rejected. The order of testing will be the difference between the CBP -201 
vs. placebo at W16 for the following regimens in descending order: 
1. After a 600 mg loading dose, 300 mg dose Q2W 
2. After a 600 mg loading dose, 300 mg dose Q4W 
3. After a 600 mg loading dose, 150 mg dose Q2W 
The data will be analyze d using the analysis of variance ( SAS PROC MIXED PROCEDURE 
FOR ANOVA) model, and a 95% confidence interval for the difference in % reduction in EASI from baseline to W16  between each CBP -201 regimen vs. placebo  will be provided.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on FAS and PPS. The statistical conclusion will be 
based on FAS only. The testing on PPS are for supporting purpose and no multiplicity 
justification will be fu rther conducted on analyses using PPS.  
13.6.2. Analysis for secondary  efficacy endpoint  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
• IGA (0 -1): Proportion
 of subjects with both IGA score 0 to 1 and a reduction of ≥ 2 points at 
Week 16  
• EASI:  
o EASI -50: Propor tion of subjects achieving ≥ 50% reduction of EASI score from 
Baseline at  W16  
o EASI -75: Propor tion of subjects achieving ≥ 75% reduction of EASI from 
Baseline at  W16  
o EASI -90: Propor tion of subjects achieving ≥ 90% reduction of EASI from 
Basel ine to W16 
• Change from baseline to Week 16 in  weekly average of PP-NRS  
• Number of AD flares from Baseline through W16  
• Number of days with AD flare from Baseline through W16 
For categorical secondary efficacy endpoints, counts , percentage, and confidence interval 
obtained based on the Clopper-Pearson method will be presented for each CBP -201 regimen and 
placebo, respectively . For quantitative secondary efficacy endpoints, the method for statistical 
analysis is similar to those for primary effica cy endpoints.  
Proportion of subjects achieving IGA (0 -1), and proportion of subjects achieving EASI -50, 
EASI -75, or EASI-90 in the EASI score will be plotted by [CONTACT_12514].  Mean 
change (±SD) from baseline for P -NRS will be plotted by [CONTACT_12514].  
Protocol No.: CBP- 201-WW001  May 2 8, 2020 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL          Page 72 of 93 
For the secondary efficacy endpoints, summary statistics will be provided  by [CONTACT_1570]. 
The clopper-pearson confidence interval will also be provided for endpoints of proportions. No 
formal statistical comparison will be  performed . 
In this study, subjects are permitted to take TCS treatment (rescue) for AD flares. It is expected 
subjects randomized to placebo arm will require TCS medication more often  or for longer 
periods.   
All other details for efficacy analyses will be handled as discussed in the Study’s SAP.    
13.7. Analysis of Safety  
Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the Safety Set  (as defined in Section  13.3).  
Safety data will be summarized using frequency tables (counts with percentages) and will be 
presented by [CONTACT_12562] . AEs will be classified by [CONTACT_3772] (MedDRA) terminology. Continuous safety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_12514].  Data will be compared 
to the reference ranges provided and be checked for abnormality and/or clinically relevant changes from baseline, where applicable.  
No formal statistical comparisons will be performed for safety endpoints. 
13.7.1. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
For continuous laboratory parameters, descriptive statistics will be presented for the value at each assessment time and for the changes from baseline screening labs by [CONTACT_1570].  
Additionally, clinical laboratory parameters will be categorized as low, normal, or high according to laboratory range specifications and the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category will be presented in shift tables.  
Laboratory values that are outside the normal range will also be flagged in the data listings, 
along with corresponding normal ranges. 
13.7.2. Vital Signs and ECG 
Descriptive summaries (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) of actual values and 
changes from Baseline will be calculated for vital signs and ECG. Detailed description of the 
analysis will be inc luded in the Study SAP.  The incidence of abnormal ECG findings will be 
summarized.

Pharmacokinetics : Individual plasma concentrations will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics by [CONTACT_12563] . The PK analyses will be documented separately in the PK/PD SAP.   
Pharmacodynamics : Changes of serum levels of IL -4, IL -13, IgE, TARC and Peripheral 
eosinophil count will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_12564], if appropriate, plotted for each treatment together with mean and SD. The PD analyses will 
be documented separately in the PK/PD SAP. 
Details and results of the PK and PD analyses will be reported separately in the PK/PD Analytical Rep ort and the PK/PD Report. 
13.9. Missing data  
For analysis of binary efficacy endpoints, subjects who have no data at a specific time point will be considered as non-responders. 
For all numerical  summary of the primary efficacy endpoint (change in EASI ) and the secondary 
efficacy endpoint analysis items (changes in IGA, P-NRS , POEM , affected BSA , SCORAD, 
DLQI ), the missing individual value at the time points other than W16 , the last observation 
carried forward (L OCF) will be applied. If the individual value is missing at W16, the worst 
observation carried forward (WOCF) method will be applied. 
Methods for calculating some or all missing data regarding time will be explained in the SAP.

16.5. APPENDIX E  (EASI) :  
ECZEMA AREA AND SEVERITY INDEX (EASI)  
EASI score measures the severity and extent of AD and erythema, infiltration, excoriation and 
lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head/neck, trunk, upper and lower extremities.  
The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points; higher scores reflecting 
the worse severity of AD.

16.6. APPENDIX F (BSA):  
PERCENT BODY SURFACE AREA (BSA) FOR AD INVOLVEMENT  
Estimate maximum percentages for each region using the “rule of nines”:  
• head and neck [9%]  
• anterior trunk [18%] 
• back [18%] 
• upper limbs [18%] 
• lower limbs [36%] 
• genitals [1%] 
 
The number of handprints of AD skin in a body region can be used to determine the extent (%) 
to which a body region is involved with AD. The area represented by [CONTACT_12575]'s hand with all five digits adducted together, is approximately 1% of the subject's BSA, 
regardless of the subject's age. Handprints across various body regions assessed as part of the 
EASI assessment is used to calculate BSA % AD involvement.

16.7. APPENDIX G  (SCORAD) :  
SEVERITY SCORING OF AD (SCORAD) SCORAD is a clinical tool for assessing the 
severity (extent/intensity) of AD and subjective signs/symptoms (e.g. pruritus/insomnia). The 
extent of lesions is scored by [CONTACT_12527]. The intensity is determined by [CONTACT_12576] 6 items on a scale from 0 to 3 (erythema, edema, oozing/crusting, excoriations, lichenification and dryness). Each item is be scored on the most representative area for a given intensity item. Subjective symptoms are graded using a visual analogue scale (VAS) where 0 = 
no itch (or insomnia) and 10 = worst imaginable itch (or insomnia). The total score is the sum of 
extent/5 + 7 x intensity/2 + VAS (symptoms) with a SCORAD range between 0 and 103; higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD .

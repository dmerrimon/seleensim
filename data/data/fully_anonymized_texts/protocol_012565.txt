 Ketamine for Acute Pain after Trauma: KAPT Trial  
General Information  
Intravenous infusions of ketamine at sub -dissociative doses have gained popularity as the drug 
in low doses is thought to decrease pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_567050]. However, evidence 
supporting ketamine in trauma patients is mixed. With the current opi[INVESTIGATOR_567051], providers are increasingly searching for effective non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_567052]. Trauma patients are a particularly vulnerable population. Approximately one -third of 
trauma pat ients admitted to the Red Duke Trauma Institute (RDTI) at Memorial Hermann Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -[LOCATION_007] 
Medical Center (MHH -TMC) are at moderate to high risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554]. While regional anesthetic 
techniques are extremely useful in the management of acute pain, tra uma patients often have more 
than one body system injured limiting the effectiveness of such techniques. The proposed project is a 
comparative effectiveness study in which acutely injured trauma patients will be randomized to one of 
two acute pain interven tions: 1) ketamine drip + usual care or 2) usual care. The primary outcome will 
be opi[INVESTIGATOR_567053]. Additionally, we plan to perform an exploratory analysis on 
how best to describe a patient’s pain experience after  injury.  
Background  
 
Effective pain relief after trauma is essential  to allow for patient mobilization, improve 
functional status, and minimize post -injury emotional stress.(1 -4) Opi[INVESTIGATOR_567054] a mainstay in 
acute pain management following injury. Even today, guideli nes recommend opi[INVESTIGATOR_567055].(5) However, opi[INVESTIGATOR_567056].(6)  
Trauma patients are a particularly vulnerable popul ation. Approximately one -third are at 
moderate to high risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554] ( Lane S, unpublished data ) and 13% progress to persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_567057] (Baker, RC unpublished data) . The RDTI has taken great strides to minimize opi[INVESTIGATOR_567058], but additional strategies are needed.  
The Red Duke Trauma Institute (RDTI) at Memorial Hermann Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -[LOCATION_007] Medical Center 
(MHH -TMC) has a long history of implementing and testing the use of multimodal pain regimens 
(MMPR), whereby [CONTACT_105] -opio id medications are given in a scheduled fashion with opi[INVESTIGATOR_567059] ( https://med.uth.edu/surgery/acute -trauma -pain -multimodal -therapy/ ). While our  
MMPR has dramatically reduced the in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_567060], injury results in 
substantial pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_567061] ( Wei S, unpublished data ). This is especially true in the 
first few days after injury. To further redu ce opi[INVESTIGATOR_5437], we need additional treatment strategies in 
addition to the current of an MMPR to further reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_567062].  
A promising intervention for acute pain is intravenous ketamine given at a s ub-dissociative dose.  
Ketamine is a phencyclidine analog and dissociate anesthetic. The use of sub -dissociative doses of 
ketamine have greatly increased in recent years despi[INVESTIGATOR_567063]. 
In one of the most recent clinical trials of ketamine  in patients with rib fractures, a sub -dissociative dose 
of ketamine did not significantly reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_567064] 91 patients, though a significant reduction 
was seen in the more severely injured sub -population.(3) The most recent guidelines published b y the 
American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine,

and the American Society of Anesthesiologists recommend sub -dissociative ketamine infusions for 
patients undergoing painful surgery.(4)  
 
Ketamine has a relatively wide therapeutic window. It is commonly used at higher doses for 
procedural sedation and perioperative anesthesia. Higher doses, however, can precipi[INVESTIGATOR_567065]. There are few known 
contra -indications for ketamine at sub -dissociative doses, but the following are relative 
contraindications:(4)  
1) Pregnancy  
2) Poorly controlled cardiovascular disease, including unstable coronary artery disease  and 
hypertensio n 
3) Severe hepatic dysfunction  (cirrhosis)  
 
For the remainder of this proposal, the sub -dissociative dose of intravenous ketamine (0.25 
mg/kg/hr) will simply be referred to as ketamine.  
 
Lastly, clinical researchers have struggled to fully describe the pain experiences of patients 
across levels of care. For example, pain levels in intubated and non -verbal patients have been assessed 
using visual clues. At the RDTI, the Behavioral Pain Score (BPS) is used in non -verbal patients. The BPS is 
a three domain tool with [ADDRESS_744849], patients 
who can verbalize are asked to report subjective levels of pain. At the RDTI, the Numeric Rating Scale 
(NRS) is used in verbal patients; the NRS is an 11 point scale wit h a range from 0 -11. These scales 
measure the same thing – pain – but with differing values representing different assessments. As the 
two tools are not interchangeable, the longitudinal interpretation of both pain tools over time in the 
same patient is no t currently possible. These scoring systems, however, are done universally by [CONTACT_567078]. Other methods of pain testing in clinical research, 
such as sensory testing, are simply not feasible in large, longit udinal, population -based studies.  
 
Hypothesis and Specific Aims:  
 
The overall hypothesis of the grant is that intravenous ketamine in addition to usual care (UC)  
will result in a lower opi[INVESTIGATOR_567066].  
 
Specific Aims:  
1) To perform a randomized controlled trial of intravenous ketamine/UC to UC alone. The 
infusion will begin as early as possible  and continue for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum 
of 72 h ours after admission. Additionally, the infusion will begin again after each subsequent 
major surgery. The primary outcome will be in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_567067] (measured as Morphine 
Milligram Equivalents [MME]). Secondary outcomes will be pain scores, compl ications, and 
patient -centered outcomes. Heterogeneity of treatment effect will be assessed by [CONTACT_567079] -generating subgroup analyses to identify moderators of the 
effect of the different treatment  strategies.  
2) To longitudi nally quantify the pain experience of a patient during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_567068] -collected pain scores. This exploratory and novel 
method will require the standardization of the NRS and BPS pain tools and compare the  global

Screening:  All adult trauma patients (≥ 16 years) arriving to the trauma center and admitted to the 
trauma service will be screened for eligibility by [CONTACT_243126]. The research staff is available 
24/[ADDRESS_744850] data. Once  it is determined that the patient is eligible, the 
research staff will randomize the patient into one of the two study treatment groups and will notify the 
clinical physician team of the randomization allocation.  
 
Randomization : Randomization will be bloc ked and stratified by [CONTACT_567081]. An independent 
statistician will determine the randomization sequence. REDCap will be utilized for the randomization.  
 
Consent:  
Effective pain control should begin as early as possible. Often, in the Emergency Depar tment, 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_567071]. Ketamine is 
commonly used in the Emergency Department as well, but at higher doses for moderate sedation during 
procedures (fracture reduction and splinting , tube thoracostomy, etc…). The fundamental change this 
trial addresses is the provision of lower doses of ketamine earlier  in the patient’s emergency care.  
We request a waiver of consent to randomize patients as:  
• The intervention is minimal risk; the keta mine dosing proposed is already being used by 
[CONTACT_439064][INVESTIGATOR_11530], emergency room physicians, and trauma surgeons at similar or 
higher doses. It is widely considered a safe drug with a wide therapeutic  window.  
• The research could not be practicably carrie d out without the waiver; due to the acute 
clinical status of the trauma patient population (intubation, intoxication, severe pain, 
emotional stress), truly informed consent cannot be obtained in the vast majority of patients 
(or their legally authorized r epresentative [LAR]) before the ketamine would be  given.  
• The waiver would not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; patients often 
receive opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942]/or ketamine in the Emergency Department acutely without their 
knowledge or written con sent, they simply want pain control. We will be providing pain 
control and rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_567072].  
 
Once the patient is randomized, a member of the trauma research team will make attempts to contact 
[CONTACT_567082] (PHI), to return to 
perform discharge surveys, and to contact [CONTACT_567083] -discharge surveys. Consents will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_59856]. Once appropriate to appro ach the patient for consent, a study 
team member will explain the study, its implications for the patient, and give the patient written study  o Seizure  disorder  
o In patients with an unknown past medical history, 
patients will be excluded  if: 
▪ They have a median sternotomy  scar 
▪ Mechanism of injury is fall from  standing  
▪ Age >65  years  
▪ Any arrhythmia on  EKG 
• Pregnancy  
• Prisoners (defined as those arriving from a correctional 
facility)  
• History of dementia or movement disorder (e.g. 
Parkinson’s)

In a previous acute pain trial (Multi -modal Analgesic Strategies for Trauma [MAST] Trial) of 1,616 
patients using a similar methodology for consent, 1,207 (75 %) patients signed consent, 35 (2%) were 
waived due to death prior to consent, 178 (11%) were waived as the patient was discharged prior to 
consent, 141 (9%) were waived due to 5 days of attempts elapsing, and 55 (3%) patients declined 
participation.

Sample Size and Feasibility : 
Given the uncertainty of an exact treatment effect of ketamine in ou r patient population and 
the potential for contamination of the control group if the trial is continued for a prolonged length of 
time, we recommend performing the largest feasible study over [ADDRESS_744853]: Though not exactly generalizable to our population, the previous ketamine 
trial in trauma patients reported a 20% reduction in MME over the first two days after admission.  
Feasibility: Over the last 6 months (November 2018 – April 2019), manual review of admission to 
the trauma service revealed 302 potentially eligible patients. This is equivalent to 906 patients 
potentially eligible patients over the 18 -month trial period. Given the emergent nature of the 
intervention and genera l difficulties enrolling severely injured patients, we conservatively estimate 
enrolling 40% of potentially eligible patients.  
Sample size and power: We therefore anticipate recruiting approximately N = 395 into the 
current trial. Based on its skewed distr ibution we posit that MME’s per day will be Gamma distributed 
(MME’s need not be integer values). Using the 50th and 75th percentiles, MME = 45 and 67 respectively, 
from our previous data we estimate the control condition as following the distribution ~Gam ma(shape = 
2.7784923, scale = 18.343307). Further, assuming that the ketamine condition results in a 20% decrease 
in MME’s (50th and 75th percentiles MME = 36 and 53.6 respectively) we assume the observed data for 
this condition is distributed ~Gamma (shap e = 2.7784923, scale = 14.674646). We assume that 
clustering within unit induces a substantial ICC = 0.2. Finally, we stipulated that a 75% chance that the 
ketamine treatment reduces MME’s by [CONTACT_2669] 15% relative to treatment as usual would constitute 
sufficient evidence to warrant a larger clinical trial. Assuming the previously stated sample size, effect, 
ICC and decision rule, K = [ADDRESS_744854] there is a > 99% chance of observing 
this effect.  
 
General Data Analytic Plan : 
The data  analytic strategy will use Bayesian inference, applying generalized linear multilevel 
modeling with level -two random effects or fixed effects (depending on model convergence) to account 
for clustering of participants within department and, where applicabl e, observations within participants. 
Modeling will use R v. 3.4 and Stan v. 1.10.(9, 10) Initial analyses will examine group differences for 
baseline variables and examination of correlations between baseline variables and specified outcomes. 
For the purpo ses of evaluating the comparability of groups, a posterior probability that a 
difference/correlation exists of > 95% will constitute evidence for statistically reliable differences.  
Potential confounders, so identified, will result in two sets of analyses: one in which the relevant 
variable is included as a covariate and one in which it is not.(11, 12) This will permit determination of 
the degree to which any group differences might c onfound conclusions regarding treatment. All 
analyses will use intention -to-treat principles. Bayesian approaches will implement joint modeling of 
observed outcomes and the missing data which is robust to ignorable missingness (i.e., MCAR and 
MAR).(13) Sen sitivity analyses will evaluate robustness of analytic conclusions to missing data. Non - 
ignorable missing data patterns will be addressed through pattern -mixture modeling methods.(14)

Convergence of Bayesian analyses on the posterior distribu tions via Monte -Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) 
will be assessed via graphical (Gelman -Rubin Plots) and quantitative (Gelman -Rubin Diagnostics and 
Effective Sample Size) evidence. Evaluation of posterior distributions will permit statements regarding 
the probabi lity that effects of varying magnitudes exist, given the data. Diffuse, neutral priors will reflect 
the initial uncertainty regarding effect sizes. For all generalized linear multilevel models, priors for 
regression coefficients will be specified as ~Norma l (µ=0, σ2=1000) on the identity or log -scale 
depending upon the model, level one error variances will be specified as ~Half -T (df = 3, mean = 0, 
standard deviation = 100). Prior distribution for level two variances will use ~Half -T (df = 3, mean = 0, 
stan dard deviation = 1000). Priors for the comparison of proportions will be specified as ~Beta (α=0.5, 
β=0.5). For all subgroup analyses using multilevel models the approach will follow that used in Tyson, et 
al.(15)  
 
One of the major limitations in the condu ct of clinical trials on acute pain is the difficulty 
interpreting patients’ pain experience in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. While the NRS pain scores are ubiquitous, easy to 
use, and compliance is high, the scores are subjective and relative to a patient’s expectations,  pain 
tolerance, and immediate context. The BPS is a validated tool for measuring pain in non -verbal patients 
and is more objective. However, it has not been scaled to allow for use in conjunction with the NRS to 
fully describe a patient’s pain experience.  
In addition to the above limitations, both the NRS and BPS are measurements of a patient’s pain 
at one time point. Pain is dynamic. The amount of time a patient spends at a given pain level is likely 
more reflective of their global pain experience than si ngle measures.  
To attempt to address the pain score limitation noted in the Background section, we plan an 
exploratory analysis whereby [CONTACT_567086]:  
1) Create a scale to standardize the two measurements (See Table  1) 
2) Use the date and time of each measure to model the trajectory  of pain assessments and the 
time for which a patient stays at those pain  levels  
3) Use the area under the curve to quantify the global pain experience of the  patient  
4) Compare varying levels of this area under the curve to different outcomes,  including:  
• Euro -QOL EQ -5D-3L at discharge (Appendix  2) 
• Euro -QOL EQ -5D-3L at 6 months (Appendix  2) 
• Presence of continued post -traumatic pain  (Yes/No)  
• Persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]  (Yes/No)  
• PTSD Screening Tool (PC -PTSD -5) (Appendix 3) at  discharge  
• PTSD Screening Tool (PC -PTSD -F) (Appendix 3) at  discharge  
• ORT Screening Tool (Appendix 4) at  discharge

Traditionally reported pain scores are listed as 
to the left (Table 3). This, however, neglects 
the amount of time spent at said pain levels.  To 
try and address this limitation, we will model pain and 
time, as below (Figure Two). In this model, the area un der 
the curve would quantify both the level and duration of 
acute pain, representing a global assessment of a 
patient’s pain experience.

Statistical Plan:  
Multilevel generalized linear or generalized additive models will fit functional forms to pain 
scores. Random effects will permit each participant to have individualized functional forms. Comparison 
of different functional forms will use the AIC or AIC c. Having estimated the functional form for each 
participant’s pain -score curve we will estimate the area under each curve using appropriate methods of 
integration. The resulting AUC’s will serve as summary measures of each participant’s pain experience. 
Multi level generalized linear models will then evaluate the Euro -QOL EQ -5D-3L at discharge, patient 
satisfaction with pain management at discharge, Euro -QOL EQ -5D-3L at [ADDRESS_744855] -traumatic pain (Yes/No), persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (Yes/No),  PTSD Screening Tool (PC -PTSD -5) each as a 
function of pain AUC.

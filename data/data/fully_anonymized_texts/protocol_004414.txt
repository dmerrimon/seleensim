I.  ABSTRACT  
 
Introduction:  Inadequate pain control in the emergency department, particularly in the pediatric 
population, is a major health concern. The intranasal route of medication a dministration is gaining 
popularity secondary to its rapid onset of action, minimal discomfort for the patient and relative 
simplicity.  When pediatric patients present with moderate to severe pain from traumatic injuries, o pi[INVESTIGATOR_755983], but they  may not always be the best option  for 
numerous reasons . Sub -dissociative dosing of ketamine has been shown to be an effective alternative to 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_755984].  
 
Objectives: The objectives of  this study are to 1) determine if intranasal ketamine is non -inferior to 
intranasal fentanyl in reduction of pain in children presenting with extremity injuries and 2) define and 
compare the level of sedation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_755985].  
 
Methods: The proposed study is a double -blind, randomized clinical non -inferiority trial of intranasal sub -
dissociative ketamine compared to intranasal fentanyl for children ages 8  through  17 years of age 
presentin g to the emergency department with moderat e or severe pain due  to traumatic extremity injury .  
 
Discussion: This study will determine whether intranasal ketamine is an effective alternative to intranasal 
fentanyl for analgesia in children. This would be pa rticularly useful in children who experience adverse 
effects with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], have developed opi[INVESTIGATOR_755986] a result of chronic painful conditions, have poor 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_755987], in pediatric trauma patients with hypote nsion or in 
patients requiring procedural sedation during their emergency department visit.  
 
 
26Nov2018  3  II. PURPOSE OF STUDY  
The purpose of this study is to compare intranasal sub -dissociative dosing of ketamine with intranasal 
fentanyl for acute pain associated with traumati c limb injuries in children 8 -17 years of age presenting to 
the emergency department.  
 
Primary Objective (or Aim)  
The primary objective of this study is to determine if intranasal sub -dissociative ketamine (1 .5 mg/kg) is 
non-inferi or to intranasal fentanyl (2 mcg/kg) in reduction of moderate and severe pain (VAS score greater 
than 35 mm [1]) associated with extremity injuries in children ages 8 years through 17 years of age.  
 
Hypothesis #1 :  Intranasal sub -dissociative ketamine (1 .5 mg/kg) and intranasal fentanyl (2 
mcg/kg) will both reduce pain by a mean VAS score of at least 15 mm. There will be no 
significant difference in the means for reduction in pain score between patients receiving 
intranasal ketamine and those receiving intr anasal fentanyl.   
 
Secondary Objective (or Aim)  
The secondary objective is  to define and compare the level of sedation associated with intranasal sub -
dissociative ketamine (1 .5 mg/kg) and intranasal fentanyl (2 mcg/kg) as measured by [CONTACT_756046].  
 
 Hypothesis #2a :  There will be no significant difference in mean sedation scale scores 
 between the intranasal ketamine group and the intranasal fentanyl group.  
 
 Hypothesis #2b :  There will be no signif icant difference in the mean capnometry values 
 of the two groups.  Patients in both groups will not experience hypopneic  
 hypoventilation  (decrease in capnometry value  of ≥ 10 mm Hg).  
 
III. BACKGROUND  
 A recent Institute of Medicine report illustrates that inadequate pain control is a major public 
health concern [2], especially in the emergency department [3]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_755988], pain 
continues to be underdiagnosed and undertreated, particularly in the pediatric population [4, 5] . In one 
study, less than half  of 172 children presenting with acute limb fractures received an analgesic during their 
emergency department visit [6]. A more recent study in 2012 looking at 773 children with long bone 
fractures demonstrated that 10% received adequate pain medication, 31% received inade quate pain 
medication and 59% received no pain medication within the first hour of arriving in the emergency 
department [7]. In combined emergency departments where both adults and pediatric patients are 
treated, children are significantly less likely than adults to received pain medications [8, 9] , with the 
youngest children being  the most vulnerable population [7, 10] . Furthermore, when children do receive 
pain medication, they often encounter long delays in medication administration [11] possibly due to the  
time required to obtain intravenous access. More recently, the intranasal route has been shown to offer 
a more efficient alternative to allow for faster delivery of pain medication [12]. This route is gaining 
popularity secondary t o its rapid onset of action, minimal discomfort for the patient and relative 
simplicity.   
 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_755989] [7]. Their  use during pediatric emergency department visits has 
increased significantly over the past decade [13]. However, multiple studies show the majority of children 
who present in severe pain do not receive opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], receive doses that are below those recommended [4, 
26Nov2018  4  7-10, 14]  or experience l ong delays in receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] [11, 15] . The reasons f or this are unclear, but we 
speculate that this may be due in part to fear of adverse effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], provider inexperience with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_755990].  Additionally, due to genetic 
variations that m ay affect opi[INVESTIGATOR_755991], ideal dosing to adequately control severe pain in the majority 
of patients yet avoid adverse medication -related side effects is difficult to ascertain and may lead 
providers to seek out non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_755992] h acute severe pain [16-18].  
 In the adult population, low dose ketamine is well tolerated and has been used successfully as an 
adjuvant [19-25] and an alternative [26-30] to opi[INVESTIGATOR_755993], rapid pain relief in the 
emergency department.  One study demonstrated that the majority of patients and physicians were 
satisfied with sub -dissociative dosing of ketamine and provided reasons why physicians opted to use 
ketamine, inc luding opi[INVESTIGATOR_755994], concern for respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], concern for opi[INVESTIGATOR_755995]. In this study, 96% of emergency medicine physicians felt that low dose ketamine 
was underused [23].  Though most of these adult studies used the intravenous route, intranasal ketamine 
has also been used s uccessfully in adults with acute pain in the emergency department, inpatient and 
outpatient settings [31-38].   
 As a dissociative anesthetic, ketamine is the most commonly used agent to  facilitate painful 
procedures in the pediatric emergency department [39]. At lower doses, it has been used in children to 
provide analgesia in a variety of acute a nd chronic pain settings [40].  Low dose ketamine has been used 
effectively in children with terminal diagnoses [41-43], sickle cell disease [44], perioperative pain [45, 46] , 
traumatic injuries [47, 48] , extensive burns [49] and conditions where opi[INVESTIGATOR_755996] [50]. As 
with the adult population, ketamine has been used via the intranasal route to provide adequate analgesia 
and sedation in children, specifically in the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755997] [51-59]. 
 To our knowledge, the PI[INVESTIGATOR_755998]-dissociative dose ketamine as monotherapy for acute pain in children presenting to the emergency 
department with traumatic injuries [60, 61] . In this study, intr anasal fentanyl and ketamine were 
associated with similar pain reduction and satisfaction scores. These study results have yet to be 
replicated. If the results are reproducible, intranasal ketamine would be particularly useful in children who 
experience ad verse effects with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], have developed opi[INVESTIGATOR_755986] a result of chronic painful 
conditions, have poor opi[INVESTIGATOR_755999]. Additionally, for patients that requir e procedural sedation for fracture reduction, 
avoiding opi[INVESTIGATOR_756000] [62].  
During the PI[INVESTIGATOR_756001], adverse events were documented based on patient self -report.  Howev er, 
there have been no studies that document side effects, vital signs, and continuous end tidal CO [ADDRESS_1034770], sedation level, vital signs, continuous end tidal CO2 
monitoring and adverse events.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
26Nov2018  5  Findings from Clinical Studies  
 
Clinical Studies  of Sub -dissociative  (Low -Dose ) Dose Ketamine  in Adults  
 
Intravenous (IV) Administration  
 
When used as monotherapy, subdissociative intravenous ketamine has been shown to provide effective 
analgesia and safety comparable to morphine for acute pain in the emergency department [27, 28] . 
Galinski, et al demonstrated that low doses of IV ketamine significantly lowered consumption of 
morphine by [CONTACT_756047] (6 % with nausea/vomiting and 36% with neuropsychological effects , such as 
dizziness and dysphoria,  in the ketamine group vs 6% with nausea/vomiting and 3% with 
neuropsychological effects in the placebo group) [25]. Ketamine combined with either morphine or 
hydromorphone has been shown to provide analgesia superior to that of morphine alone and resulted 
in only few minor side effects [19-22, 24] .  In the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], Tran et al found that ketamine had 
an analgesic effect similar to morphine and carried a lower risk of vomiting and airway problems than 
morphine. They also discovered that ketami ne tended to improve blood pressure in hypotensive 
patients to a greater degree [63] (increase of 9.3 mm  Hg with ketamine vs 4.8 mm Hg with morphine). In 
adult patients requiring procedural sedation and analgesia, Messenger et al found that patients 
receiving fentanyl and propofol were 5.[ADDRESS_1034771] a serious intrasedation event than 
patients  receiving ketamine and propofol but the two groups had similar analgesic efficacy [29].  
 
Intranasal (IN) Administration  
 
More recently, the intranasal route  has been a highly effective method of administering ketamine at 
sub-dissociative doses. One study revealed that intranasal ketamine was an effective analgesic agent in 
56% of patients presenting to the emergency department with severe pain [32] while another 
demonstrated clinically significant reduction in pain scores in 88% of ED patients [31]. In both studies, IN 
ketamine resulted in very mild, transient side effects. Intranasal ketamine has been shown to be a safe, 
well-tolerated alternative to opi[INVESTIGATOR_756002] [35, 
38]. Furthermore, intranasal ketamine has provid ed rapid onset analgesia for breakthrough pain in adult 
patients with chronic pain conditions [33, 34] . One study showed that patients receiving ketamine 
achieved pain relief within 10 minutes of dosing which lasted up to 60 minutes and none of these 
patients required rescu e medication to treat the pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] [34]. (See Appendix A for further details)

Clinical Studies  of Sub -dissociative Dose Ketamine  in Children  
 
Intravenous (IV) Administration  
 
Sub-dissociative intravenous dosing of ketamine has been used safely and effectively in a variety of 
acute and chronic pediatric conditions. One meta -analysis found that admin istration of ketamine was 
associated with decreased PACU postoperative pain intensity and analgesic requirement [45]. Two 
studies demonstrated that ketamine given prior to tonsillectomy resulted in significantly lower pain 
scores and less rescue analgesic consumption postoperatively with no difference in the incidence of 
vomiting or psychological sequelae [46, 64] .  White et al described the use of ketamine as effective 
analgesia in children with toxic megacolon, a painful condition where morphine is contraindicated. None 
of these children reported adverse effects [50].  White et al also described t he long -term (37 days), 
successful use of ketamine for a child with extensive burns. This patient tolerated the medication well, 
never developed signs of tolerance and was able to be weaned rapi[INVESTIGATOR_756003] 
[49]. Various hematologic and oncologic painful conditions that are insufficiently controlled with opi[INVESTIGATOR_756004]. Two studies showed an opi[INVESTIGATOR_756005] -related pain 
[41, 42] , while another study described sickle cells patien ts with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -refractory pain who achieved 
clinically significant analgesia after the initiation of ketamine infusion [44].  Taylor et al describes the use 
of ketamine for end -of-life neuropathic pain in which all patients noted subjective pain relief and 79% of 
patients had no adverse effects [43].  Ketamine has been used effectively in the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_756006]. None of these patients demonstrated a loss of airway, oxygen desaturation or 
clinically significant emergence reaction after ketamine [48].  One emergency department study 
demonstrated that ketamine combined with midazolam is more effective than fentanyl combined with 
midazolam when used for emergency pediatric orthopedic procedures and that res pi[INVESTIGATOR_756007] [47]. 
 
Intranasal (IN) Administration  
 
The intranasal route of administering ketamine to children has become more popular over the past few 
years.  A study done in 2013 determined that 1 mg/kg intranasal ketamine provided adequate analgesia 
with only mild, transient side effects that did not require any treatment. None of these patients 
experienced dis sociation or hallucination [61].  The PI[INVESTIGATOR_756008] (82% and 79% respectively 
had VAS reductions > 20 mm) and satisfaction scores (83% and 72% respectively achieved satisfaction) in 
patients with pain from limb injuries. Again, these patients experienced no serious adverse events [60].  
One case series and one case report describe the effective use of intranasal ketamine in patients where 
intravenous access could not be established. Patients encountered few, non -serious side effects [52, 53] . 
Tsze et al illustrates the use of various doses (3, 6, or 9 mg/kg) of intranasal ketamine for procedural 
sedation in pedia tric laceration repair. The only adverse event documented was vomiting in 1 patient 
26Nov2018  8  [51].  Ano ther study explored  the use of ketamine in uncooperative pediatric dental patients. The overall 
sedation success rate was 89% with ketamine only, 84% with ketamine plus midazolam and 69% with 
midazolam only. There were no significant adverse effects in any of the three groups [55]. Intranasa l 
ketamine was also found to be a safe and effective premedication in children undergoing MRI with 
nausea and vomiting as the only documented side effect [57].  Multiple studies have demonstrated the 
successful use of intranasal ketamine in combination w ith either intranasal midazolam or sufentanil as 
an analgesic or sedative for pediatric procedures [54, 56, 58, 59] . These studies demonstrated only few, 
mild adverse effects with intranasal ketamine. (See Appendix B for further details )

The proposed study is a d ouble -blind, randomized controlled  non-inferiority trial of intranasal sub -
dissociative ketamine compared to intranasal fentanyl  for treatment of pain associated with extremity 
injuries .  
 
Intervention drug:  
Ketamine (50 mg/mL ) injectable solution is a nonbarbiturate anesthetic chemically designated dl 2-(0-
chlorophenyl) -2-(methylamino) cyclohexanone hydrochloride. It is formulated as a slightly acid ic (pH 3.5 -
5.5) sterile  solution for intravenous or intramuscular injection in concentrations contain ing the equivalent 
of 50 mg ketamine base per milliliter and contains not more than 0.1 mg/mL Phemerol®  (benzethonium 
chloride) added as a preservative.  
 
Comparator drug:  
Fentanyl Citrate Injection, USP, CII (50 mcg/mL)  is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of fentanyl citrate in 
water for  injection. Fentanyl Citrate is a potent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2641] . Each milliliter contains fentanyl (as the 
citrate) 50 mcg (0.05 mg). It m ay contain sodium hydroxide  and/or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment. 
pH 4.7 (4.0 to 7.5).  The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is 
intended only for use  as a single -dose injection.  
 
For analgesic dose volumes equal to and less than 0.5 mL, the entire dose will be administered  via mucosal 
atomizer  in 1 of  the nares. Doses greater than 0.5 mL will be divided equally to both nares. Medication 
will be given via the LMA MAD Nasal™ which enables a seal to be formed with the nostril and atomized  
particles of medication to be delivered to the nasal mucosa . 
 
Should the guardian provide consent, the subject will be randomized to receive either the study 
medication of intranasal ketamine (1 .5 mg/kg) or the comparator of intranasal fentanyl (2 mcg/kg). 
Patients of guardians who decline will receive standard Cinci nnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_756011]. Enrolled subjects will be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1034773] 15 minutes will provide visual analog 
scale (VAS) pain scores, University of Michigan Sedation Scale scores, capnometry values, vital signs and 
detection of other adverse events. Study data bey ond 15 minutes will be obtained from study data forms 
and electronic medical records.  
 
Randomization and Blinding  
 
Randomization will be allocated through permuted block randomization with randomly varied blocks of 6 
and 8 using a 1:1 ratio within blocks. The randomization scheme will be generated by a computer random 
number generator.  Subjects will be randomized to receive either intranasal ketamine (1 .5 mg/kg) or 
intranasal fentanyl (2 mcg/kg) upon meeting inclusion criteria. Allocation will be concealed  using pre -
numbered syringes of study medication. The color and odor of the two medications in the syringes will be 
identical.  The volumes will be slightly different  due to the concentrations of the medications,  but the 
syringes will be stored in a way tha t will not allow for comparison between the syringes.  The syringes will 
be stored with s ealed envelopes  that contain instruction of how much volume of medication to 
administer. The instructions will not contain the name [CONTACT_756071].  
Investigational drug services (IDS) will prepare the study medication in a sterile fashion and place the pre-
numbered syringes in the  pyxis .  Therefore, medications will be prepared prior to patient arrival in the 
26Nov2018  [ADDRESS_1034774] experiencing a serious adverse event ( SAE) or other serious 
circumstance, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_756048]. If there is a perceived immediate need for unblinding, the pharmacy may be contact[CONTACT_756049]. A report detailing the need to unblind will be generated by [CONTACT_756050].  If unblinding occurs more than [ADDRESS_1034775] 120 minutes  of the visit.  
Partici pants  will receive a phone call 30 days after drug treatment to follow  up on any adverse events  that 
occur beyond 120 minutes  after initial medication administration . 
   
The anticipated d uration of the enrollment phase  of this study is nine months. Data analysis will occur 
over the following two months.

26Nov2018  12  6) Allergy to ketamine, fentanyl or meperidine (Fentanyl and meperidine are both in the same class 
of medications —phenylpi[INVESTIGATOR_756012]. An allergy to meperidine is an absolute contraindication to 
fentanyl use)  
7) Non -English speaking  parent and/or child  
8) History of psychosis  
9) Postmenarchal females  without a urine or serum assay  documenting the absence of pregnancy   
10) Patient brought in by 20/20 juvenile detention in Cincinnati  or in police custody  (considered a 
vulnerable population)  
11) Pregnancy  
 
Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled.  If there is a question of 
whether a patient qualifies for enrollment, the principal investigator s may be co ntacted. Any violations of 
these criteria must be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and Procedures.  
 
Potential subjects will be identified during triage via the established orthopedic evaluation protocol as 
defined by a patient that has a “suspecte d acute deformity AND is experiencing pain and/or decreased 
pulses or sensation in the injured extremity.”  When a patient meets the orthopedic  evaluation  criteria, a 
page will go out to ED staff as is standard procedure. The patient will be brought to the  designated location 
as directed by  [CONTACT_756051]. A member of the research study team trained in 
enrollment pro cedures for this trial will  respond to the designated location .  The study staff  will screen 
potentially eligible subjects u sing the protocol inc lusion and exclusion criteria.  A urine or serum assay will 
be obtained on all post menarchal females , if their pain level allows , to document negative  pregnancy 
status.  If a urine or serum assay cannot be obtained secondary to pain le vel, the subject will be excluded 
from the study  as per the exclusion criteria . 
 
Sample Size  and Power  Analysis  
 
The sample size calculation i s based on a non -infer iority test of the difference between  two means . Group 
sample sizes of 39 and 39 achieve 80% power to detect non -inferiority using a one -sided, two -sample t -
test. The margin of non -inferiority is 10.  Literature has shown that the minimum clinically significant 
difference  in VAS pain score in children is 10 -12 [65, 66]  which is why 10 was chosen as our non -inferiority 
margin.  The true difference between the means is assumed to be 5 based on  the PI[INVESTIGATOR_756001], which 
found a median rating reduction of 40 mm (IQR 20 to 45) at 30 minutes for fentanyl and a median rating 
reduction of 45 mm (IQR 20 -60) at 30 minutes for ketamine, and therefore, a difference in medians of 5 
(-10 to 20, 95% CI) [60]. Using the IQR information from the PI[INVESTIGATOR_756013], we estimate the standard deviations to be 29.63 and 22.22 for the rating r eduction at 30 
minutes for the fentanyl and ketamine groups, respectively . Therefore, with an α of 0.05 and a β of 0.2 
(80% power), the sample size required to detect this difference was estimated to be [ADDRESS_1034776] to be able to 
successfully complete this study as planned.

SCREENING  
 
Potential subjects will be identified during triage via the established orthopedic evaluation protocol as 
defined by a patient that has a suspected acute deformity AND is experiencing pain and/or decreased 
pulses or sensation in the injured extremity. The patient will be brought to the shock trauma suite (STS) 
or designated area as directed via the orthopedic evaluation process where potential subjects will be  
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_756014]. An emergency medicine attend ing 
physician  and/o r fellow, resident, nurse, PCA, medic,  and child life provider will respond to the STS  or 
26Nov2018  14  designated area  as per es tablished protocol. Study staff  trained in enrollment procedures for this trial will 
also respond to the STS  or designated  area . The  nurse will obtain patient’s  pain score as per the standard 
of care. Physical exam, vital signs, weight and demographics will be collected as part of standard of care  
prior to consent.   
 
VISIT 1  
 
Process of Obtaining Informed Consent  
 
Study staff  will carry a pager and present to all orthopedic evaluations that are paged out to the ED staff. 
All patients who are triaged as an orthopedic evaluation will be screened for eligibility. Prior to 
approaching potential subjects, the eligibility criteria w ill be reviewed with the attending and/or fellow. 
Parents/guardians of subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be approached by [CONTACT_3665].  
 
The study staff will briefly introduce the study and gauge the parent/guardian’s interest. Study staff will 
initiate the consent process and review the consent document with parents/guardians who express 
interest. Parents/guardians will be given time to review the consent document independently and ask the 
study staff questions.  
 
After the consent has  been thoroughly reviewed and the parent/guardian has had all of their questions 
answered, the study staff will ask the parent/guardian if they would like for their child to participate in 
the research study. If the parent/guardian agrees to have their chi ld participate in the study, then the 
study staff will obtain their signature [CONTACT_756072]. 
Parents/guardians will receive a copy of the signed consent form. Data collected as part of the routine 
standa rd of care interventions will be used as baseline study data.  
 
We are requesting a waiver of assent  for young children (defined as patients less than 12 years of age) . 
Since we are enrolling patients with moderate to high pain scores, young patients may be limited in their 
capacity to provide assent prior to pain treatment.  We will use parental permission in lieu of assent  for 
these patients. However, patients 12 -17 years of age will be required to assent to the study. The 
investigators will  engage children 12 -17 years in a thorough discussion of the study consent and seek their 
input/decision on participation. Their decision to participate will be documented in the informed consent 
process note. It is felt that the child is most served by [CONTACT_756052]; documentation of this assent is in the informed consent process note. Study staff will obtain and 
document assent prior to the initiation of study procedures .  
 
Emergency Department Phase  
 
After  infor med  consent is obtained, the subject will be randomized to receive either intranasal ketamine 
(1.5 mg/kg) or intranasal fentanyl (2 mcg/kg). All data will be recorded on a standardized REDCap 
electronic case report form. Investigational drug services will independently prepare the study 
medications in pre -numbered sequential syringes.  The volume, color and odor of the two medications in 
the syringes will be identical. Thus, the ED treatment team, patient and patient’s family, and the research 
team will be blinded to which medication the patient will receive.  The patient’s physician will order plain 
radiographs as per standard of care, and the study drug th rough an EPIC order set. The study staff  and 
nurse will ensure a full set of vital signs (including ca pnometry value) and urine or serum pregnancy test 
for all post menarchal female patients. A nasal mucosal exam and smell test will be performed prior to 
26Nov2018  [ADDRESS_1034777] treatment.  Continuous pulse oximetry, which will be followed 
throughout the 120 minute duration of the study visit, will be applied prior to study drug administration. 
After randomization, the blinded study medicati on will be obtained from the designated  pyxis by [CONTACT_109571], who will prepare and administer  a weight bas ed amount of  the study treatment under the 
observation of the study staff . Of note, the end tidal capnometry cannula will briefly be removed while 
drug is administered and then immediately replaced. The patient will be obs erved  on monitors for 15 
minutes  in the STS or designated area . (Currently, the mean  time from arrival in STS for an orthopedic 
evaluation to leaving for radiology is 24 minutes so enrollment in this study should not prolong time in 
the STS or designated area.)  The study staff  will docume nt vital signs, capnometry value, a sedation score  
and obtain a pain score from the patient at 15 minutes after drug administration. T he nurse will document 
vital signs and  a capnometry value at 15 minutes after  drug administration. The patient will be tak en to 
radiology for plain radiographs of the injured extremity and then to an emergency department room 
where the orthopedic  evaluation  nurse will give report to the patient’s primary nurse.  T he study staff  will 
document a sedation score , obtain a pain score , document vital signs and a capnometry value  from the 
patient  at [ADDRESS_1034778] if vitals outside of the pre -determined normal ranges (see appendix 
G) are clinicall y significant or not clinically significant.   
 
Additional data collected during the ED visit will include  the need for rescue analgesia  within [ADDRESS_1034779]’s parent or 
legal guardian to follow up on any ongoing adverse events from Visit [ADDRESS_1034780]’s parent by [CONTACT_756053] (30 +/ - 5 days) before considering the subject lost to follow up.  
Adverse events will be followed until resolution or until no further change is expected.  
 
Drugs,  Devices, and Biologics:   (see A ppendix  F for further details)  
The intranasal route of administering medications had been reported for the past [ADDRESS_1034781] pass hepatic metabolism that limits 
bioavailability of oral medications.  
 
Intervention drug:  
Ketamine (50 mg/mL ) injectable solution is a nonbarbiturate anesthetic chemically designated dl 2-(0-
chlorophenyl) -2-(methylamino) cyclohexanone hydrochloride. It is formulated as a slightly acid ic (pH 3.5 -
5.5) sterile  solution for intravenous or intramuscular injection in concentrations containing the equivalent 
of 50 mg ketamine base per milliliter and contains not more than 0.1 mg/mL Phemerol®  (benzethonium 
chloride) added as a preservative.  
 
Human Pharmacokinetics:  
Nielsen, et al in 2014  investigate d a pediatric formu lation of intranasal sufentanil 0.5 mcg/ kg and ketamine 
0.5 mg/kg for p rocedural pain and  determined t he bioavailability of ketamine was 35.8%.  Maximum 
plasma concentration  (Cmax) of ketamine was 0.102 mg /L (CV 10. 8%) and Tmax was 8.5 min (CV 17.3%).  
 
Malinovsky, et al in 1996 determined that after  administration of  intranas al ketamine in children 10 -30 
kg, 2 -9 years of age, mean plasma concentrations after 3 mg/kg peaked at 496 ng/mL at 20 minutes and 
after 9 mg/kg peaked at 2104 ng/mL within 21 minutes.  Plasma concentrations of norketamine (the 
predominate  active  metabolit e), peaked at ~120 minutes after nasal ketamine. Calculated bioavailability 
from nasal administration was 50% .  The authors concluded that nasal administration of low doses of 
ketamine produced plasma concentrations associated with analgesia  (40-200 mg/mL) , but using high 
doses produced high plasma concentrations similar to those that induce anesthesia  (1100 to over 2000 
ng/mL . 
 
Packaging:   
The study medication is prepackaged by [CONTACT_756054] 10 mL each.  
 
Labeling:  
The pro duct label reads “Ketamine HCL, Injection USP, Concentrate 500 mg/ 10 mL ( 50 mg/mL) for  
intramuscular or slow intravenous use , 10 x 10 mL multi -dose vials .” 
 
Manufacturer:  
 Mylan Institutional LLC, Rockford, IL  
Dosing:  
Ketamine is in individual sterile vials of 10 mL of solution. Investigational drug services will prep ackage 
syringes with s tudy medication using aseptic technique, cap the syringes and label each with a specific 
study number.  Using weight based categories , pati ents who are randomized to receive ketamine will 
receive  a dose of 1 .5 mg/kg with a max dose of 100 mg . 
 
26Nov2018  17  Comparator drug:  
Fentanyl Citrate Injection, USP, CII (50 mcg/mL)  is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of fentanyl citrate in 
water for  injection.  Fentanyl Citrate is a potent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2641] . Each milliliter contains fentanyl (as the 
citrate) 50 mcg (0.05 mg). It m ay contain sodium hydroxide  and/or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment. 
pH 4.7 (4.0 to 7.5).  The solution contains no bacteriostat, antim icrobial agent or added buffer and is 
intended only for use  as a single -dose injection.  
 
Intranasal fentanyl is currently the standard of care in the Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_756015] w ith acute extremity injuries prior to IV 
placement.  
 
Human Pharmacokinetics  
When fentanyl is administered by [CONTACT_24625], the bioavailability is nearly 70%, with Tmax 
reached in 5 –16 minutes.   
 
Borland et al. conducted a study in 2002 looking at use of IN Fentanyl in pediatric patients (3 -12 years of 
age) in the emergency department.  With doses of 0.5 -3.4 mcg/kg (median 1.5 mcg/kg), the authors found 
the drug achieved therapeutic levels and onset of analgesia within 10 minutes and had a half -life of 1 
hour.  The authors found it unlikely to cause respi[INVESTIGATOR_756016], RR, BP, or oxygen saturations even with improvement in pain scores.  
 
Packaging:  
The study medication is packaged in 2 mL vials by [CONTACT_3455].  
 
Labeling:  
The product label r eads “Fentanyl Citrate, Injection USP, 100 mcg Fentanyl/2 mL (0.05 mg/mL) (50 
mcg/mL) IV or IM use, 2 mL single dose vial.”  
 
Manufacturer:  
West -Ward; Eatontown, NJ  
 
Dosing:  
Fentanyl is in individual sterile vials of 2  mL of solution. Investigational drug s ervices will prepa ckage 
syringes of s tudy medication using aseptic technique, cap the syringes and label each with a specific study 
number.  Using weight based categories, patients who are randomized to receive Fentanyl will receive a 
dose of 2 mcg/kg with  a max dose of 100 mcg.  
 
Syringes with ketamine and fentanyl will look identical to maintain blinding. Syringes will expi[INVESTIGATOR_352743] 9 
days. Subjects will receive either intranasal ketamine (1 .5 mg/kg) or fentan yl (2 mcg/kg) by [CONTACT_756055] a standardiz ed volume.  For analgesic dose volumes equal to and less than 0.5 mL, the entire dose will 
be administered in 1 of the nares. Doses greater than 0.5 mL will be divided equally to both nares.  
 
Medications will be given via a mucosal atomizer device. The LM A MAD Nasal (MAD300) intranasal 
mucosal atomization device (Wolfe -Tory, Medical, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT) will be attached to the Luer -
Lok syringe just before study drug administration to the patient.  0.1 mL of drug solution will be used to 
prime the MAD nasal device.   
 
26Nov2018  18  These dosages and distribution of medication are similar to previous studies using intranasal ketamine 
and/or intranasal fentanyl in which there were no significant adverse effects observed [53, 60, 61, 67 -69]. 
 
Adequate records of study drug administration and disposition will be maintained by [CONTACT_756056]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_756017]. The purpose of these rec ords is to ensure regulatory 
authorities and the sponsor that the investigational drug will not be distributed to any person who is not 
a study subject under the terms and conditions set forth in this protocol. The study medication is to be 
prescribed by t he members of this investigational team or designee and may not be used for any purpose 
other than that described in this protocol. At study completion, all drug supplies must be returned to the 
sponsor or designee.  
 
VIII. DATA ANALYSIS/METHODS  
 
Data Coll ection and Management  
 
All data will be entered onto standardized electronic data reporting forms  after initially being obtained on 
paper forms . The data reporting forms will contain the demographic, physical exam and treatment data  
outlined in this sectio n. The forms will also contain the protected health information of subject name, visit 
date, contact [CONTACT_756057]. Data from the forms will be entered into a 
database.  Protected health information will  be entered into the database .  The information will be de -
identified after study completion.  
 
Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_2329] a locked  cabinet in the research staff area  and by [CONTACT_756058] -protected databases  and computers . The password for the database will only be known to the 
research study staff . Study files will be stored  in a locked cabinet in the principal investigator’s office  which 
has limited public access . Entry to the office is pr otected by [CONTACT_756059].  Study files will be de -
identified afte r publication and retained for 3  years after study closure.  
 
Additionally, d ata about missed eligible patients will be collected periodically through an EMR report 
and supplemented by [CONTACT_756060], training needs or other issues that may 
inhibit staff’s ability to enroll. We are requesting a HIPAA waiver to  review th e patient charts via the 
MRN and  day/time of arrival and no information will be used for analysis in the research study. Consent 
would not otherwise be possible for these participants because of the nature of presentation to the ED; 
it is possible that these patients will have arrived when no study staff is available.  Data collected on 
missed eligible patients will include M RN, encounter ID, date/time of ED arrival  and discharge , means of 
arrival, date of birth, gender , whether or not they met study inclusion/exclusion criteria, disposition, 
discharge diagnosis , and provider name.  
 
Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is t he difference between  the mean reduction in pain scores between  the ketamine 
group and t he fentanyl group as measured by [CONTACT_224968] (VAS) at 30 minutes after study 
intervention.  
 
The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity whic h has been widely used in diverse 
populations [66, 72, 73] . It is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal or vertical line that is 10 cm 
(100 mm) in length anchored by [CONTACT_756061]. T he scale is most 
26Nov2018  19  commonly anchored by “no pain” (score of 0) and “pain as bad as it could be” or “worst  imaginable pain” 
(score of 100). To avoid clustering of scores around a preferred numeric value, numbers or verbal 
descriptors a t interme diate points are not present. The patient is asked to place a line perpendicular to 
the VAS line at the point that represents their current pain intensity . Using a ruler, the score is determined 
by [CONTACT_23808] (mm) on the 10 -cm line bet ween the “no pain” anchor and the patient's mark, 
providing a range of scores from 0 –100.  The visual analog scale has been shown to be valid and reliable 
in children 8 to 17 years of age suffering from acute pain and that a minimum clinically significant 
difference in VAS score ranges from 10 to 12 mm in children and adolescents [65, 66] . The optimal cut 
poin ts for mild, moderate and severe pain on the VAS  for children and adolescents have been determined 
to be  35 and 60 mm [1].  
 
Secondary Endpoints  
 
The secondary endpoints are to:  
 
▪ Define and compare the level of sedation associated with intranasal  sub-dissociative 
ketamine (1 .5 mg/kg) and int ranasal fentanyl (2 mcg/kg) as measured by [CONTACT_756062].  
▪ Compare adverse effects associated with intranasal sub -dissociative ketamine and 
intranasal fentanyl  
▪ Compare vital sign changes associated wi th intranasal sub -dissociative ketamine and 
intranasal fentanyl  
 
An additional secondary endpoint will be the difference between the ketamine group and the fentanyl 
group in pain score as measured b y the visual analog scale at [ADDRESS_1034782] treatment. Demographic data recorded 
will include age, gender , ethnicity and race.  
If there is a discrepancy between the information provided by [CONTACT_756063], the information provided by [CONTACT_756064].  
100 mm  
26Nov2018  20  Vital signs  
 
Vital sign data will be recorded at baseline, 15 minutes, 30 minutes , 60 minutes , and 120 minutes . It will 
include heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, oxygen saturation and end tidal capnometry value. 
Howeve r, an end tidal capnometry value will not be obtained at the 120 minute assessment. Oxygen 
saturation levels and cap nometry values will be obtained from the cardio -respi[INVESTIGATOR_756018]. Cardio -respi[INVESTIGATOR_756019] 120 minutes after the study medication is administered.

Other Evaluations/Measures  
A urine or serum pregnancy test will be collected from all post menarchal females , and results must be 
negative before drug treatment may be initiated.  
 
Visual analog scale pain scores will be obtained by [CONTACT_756065].  
 
University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) scores will also be obtained at baseline, 15, 30 and 60 
minutes after study intervention. The University of Michigan Sedation  Scale is a valid and reliable tool that 
allows for rapid assessment of the depth of sedation in children. It is a simple observational tool that 
assesses the level of alertness on a five -point scale [74]. It has been validated in children and has shown 
to have significant inter -rater reliability.  
 
 
 

26Nov2018  [ADDRESS_1034783] measures including additional analgesia or anti -emetics will be recorded.  
 
Of note, pain scores, sedation score s, vital signs,  capnometry v alues , and adverse effects  will be obtained 
at specific windows  of time such that the “15 minute” value will be obtained between 10 and 20 minutes 
after medication is given, “30 minute” value will be obtained between 25 and 35 minutes after medication  
is given , “60 minute” value will be obtained between 55 and 65 minutes after medication is given  and 
“120 minute” value will be obtained between [ADDRESS_1034784] deviations for continuous variables expected to be normally 
distributed, such as age, vital s igns, capnometry values, weight and  VAS pain  scores ; proportions for 
categorical variables such as gender, race and injury location; and medians with ranges for variables 
expected to not be normal ly distributed, such as  UMSS sedation scores.  All continuous variables will be 
assessed for no rmality; parametric statistics will be used for normally distributed variables and non -
parametric statistics will be used for non -normally distributed variables.  
 
Efficacy Analysis  
 
The primary analysis will include all subjects randomized based on the pr inciple of intention to treat. If 
necessary, a per -protocol analysis will also be performed to assess efficacy of the treatments actually 
received.  The primary efficacy endpoint  will be the difference in mean pain scores between the ketamine 
group and the  fentanyl group at [ADDRESS_1034785].   
 
Demographic and historical baseline information of the 2 study groups will be compared using t -tests 
(means), Mann -Whitney U (medians), and chi -square (proportions) tests. If there are any significant 
differences, linear regression will be performed to adj ust for significantly different covariates.   
 
For secondary outcomes, t -tests, or Mann -Whitney U where appropriate, will be used to evaluate 
differences in continuous outcomes (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure). Chi -square tests will be used to 
evaluate pr oportions in dichotomous outcomes (e.g. proportion with presence of specific adverse effects). 
Risk differences with 95% confidence intervals will be used to compare dichotomous outcomes such as 
the use of rescue analgesia and adverse events.  
 
 
 
26Nov2018  [ADDRESS_1034786] binomial 95% two -sided 
confidence intervals.  
 
Test of Non -Inferiority  
 
A one -sided two -sample t -test will  be used to test whether the pain reduction using ketamine is non -
inferior to that of fentanyl. When the variances of the two groups are unequal, Welch’ s t-test will be used; 
if the data are not normally distributed, the Mann -Whitney (Wilcoxon signed rank)  U test will be used  [75, 
76].  
 
Interim Analysis  
 
Due to the expected short duration of the study, no interim analysis will be performed. However, ongoing 
safety analysis of adverse events, serious adverse events and toxicities will be done.

The study will be conduc ted at one investigative site in the [LOCATION_002]. Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_756020], freestanding, 523 bed children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] 32,981 admissions and 
125,130 Emergency Department visits annually.   The population is diverse and includes 51% Caucasian, 
40% African American, 2 % Hispanic, and 7% other.   Study enrollment will only be performed at the base 
campus . 
 
X.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
Intranasal sub -dissociative dosing of ketamine has been shown in multiple studies to provide adequate 
analgesia to pediatric patients experiencing moderate to severe pain. Therefore, patients receiving the 
study medication may receive adequate analgesia and avoid the side effects associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_756021] a result of opi[INVESTIGATOR_756022]. Furthermore, patients who are genetically predisposed to 
have poor opi[INVESTIGATOR_756023].  
 
XI. POTENTIAL RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, INCONVENIENCES and PRECAUTIONS  
 
There are minimal risks associated with the administration of sub -dissociative ketamine via the intranasal 
route. All studies performed using intranasal ketamine at sub -dissociative dosing in children showed only 
minimal adverse events and no serious adver se events associated with the study medication.  Examples 
of mild adverse events which could be expected to occur with both medications include drowsiness, 
26Nov2018  23  dizziness, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, dysphoria, unpleasant taste, vision  changes, throat irritatio n, 
headache , and mild increase in heart rate and blood pres sure.  
 
Based on pharmacokinetic studies on intranasal ketamine use in children, the mean plasma 
concentrations peaked at about 20 minutes and the plasma concentrations of norketamine (the 
predomin ate active metabolite), peaked at about [ADDRESS_1034787] enrollment in this trial to be of minimal risk to patient s.  
 
XII. RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
 
Due to the prospect of direct benefit to patients and minimal risk  to patients, the risk -benefit ratio seems 
favorable to patients, parents and providers.  
 
XIII. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
Clinical Adverse Events  
 
Clinical  adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study. All adverse events will be followed 
until resolution.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All on -site serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB in accordance with CCHMC IRB policies. 
Adverse Events will be reported to the IRB per CCHMC Research Policy R -18. 
 
Definition of an Adverse Event  
 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occur rence in a subject who has received an intervention (drug, 
biologic, or other intervention).  The occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship 
with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including a n abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  Adverse event monitoring for the 
emergency department phase would start at the time of randomization and end at two hours after initial 
medication administration.  Any additional adverse event s that occur beyond 120 minutes  after initial 
medication administration  will be obtained during the 30 day follow up phone call.  
 
26Nov2018  24  All AEs  (including serious AEs) will be noted in the study records and on the case report form with a full 
description including the nature, date and time of onset, determination of non -serious versus serious, 
intensity (mild, moderate, severe), duration, causali ty, and outcome of the event.  SAEs will be reported 
within 24 hours.  
 
Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
An SAE is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
▪ death  
▪ a life -threatening event (at risk of  death at the time of the event )  
▪ requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110353] 
▪ a persistent or signi ficant disability/incapacity  
▪ results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9475] a serious adverse drug event whe n, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.   The one exception to th ese criteria is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_756024]/or pain 
management associated with the injury. Since this can be expected as part of the standard treatment 
course for orthopedic injuries, admissions for this reason will not be reported as a serious adverse event. 
However , all admissions will be trac ked and those related to adverse events or for reasons other than 
injury repair or  pain management will be reported as an SAE.  
 
Serious adverse event monitoring starts at the time of consent and ends at the time of discharge or 
admission.  All SAEs will b e followed until resolution, the event is considered to be medically stable, or for 
[ADDRESS_1034788].  
 
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs.  A severe AE is a major event of its type.  
A severe AE does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, nausea which persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but would not be an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke 
that results in only a limited degree of dis ability may be considered a mild stroke, but would be an SAE.  
 
Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) Specific to this Study  
 
There has been documentation of a few significant adverse effects associated with the medications 
included in this study. These effects ar e exceedingly rare and are anticipated to be even rarer through an 
intranasal route of drug administration compared with an intravenous route and with sub -dissociative 
dosing of ketamine as compared with dissociative dosing.  
 
Ketamine:  cardiac arrhythmia , hyp ertensive emergency , prolonged emergence reaction, anaphylaxis, 
laryngospasm, apnea  
 
Fentanyl:  cardiac arrhythmia, cardiopulmonary arrest, chest wall rigidity, hypertensive emergency, 
hypotension, pulmonary embolism, anaphylaxis, apnea, bronchospasm,  laryngospasm  
 
26Nov2018  [ADDRESS_1034789] of care at CCHMC were the 
emergency to occur in any other setti ng.  
 
Relationship of SAE to study drug or other intervention  
 
The relationship of each SAE to the study intervention should be characterized using one of the followi ng 
terms in accordance with CCHMC  IRB Guidelines: definitely, probably, possibly, or unrel ated.  
 
Monitoring Plan  
 
The medical monitor  is the person responsible for the safety mo nitoring in this protocol  and he will 
monitor all clinically significant adverse events  (AEs)  and provide consultation for any AEs that the 
investigators question the classification, severity or relatedness originally documented at the time o f the 
ED visit .  The medical monitor will be  Scott Reeves , MD. He is a member of the Division of Emergency 
Medicine, who  will not be involved with enrollment.  
 
A risk -based monitoring plan will be developed for the conduct of study monitoring.  On -site monitoring 
will occur throughout the duration of the study.  A study initiation visit will be conducted by [CONTACT_756066] b een completely trained in protocol procedures and 
Good Clinical Practices (GCP ) and  that facilities and personnel are adequate.   Scheduled monitoring will 
occur at least once per year during the conduct of the trial, with the option of making a second vis it if 
needed to address over -enrollment, under -enrollment, or protocol deviation issues.  The Monitoring Plan 
will detail the frequency and level of intensity of on -site monitoring visits.  In general, the study will  be 
monitored for all subjects at a leve l of 100% of study data gathered for inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
informed consent procedures, and adverse events.  At a minimum, at least 20% of the study subject’s data 
will be monitored against the study’s database.  
 
During scheduled interim monito ring visits, the monitors will verify that the protocol is being followed 
and that data are being collected according to protocol requirements.  The monitors will review the Study 
Regulatory File to determine that all required documentation is being collec ted and that the IRB approval 
for the study is current.  They will then verify that each subject has signed the correct version of the 
informed consent document, and that this document is filed in the subject’s file.  Adverse event 
documentation is checked  for completeness and accuracy.  Drug and supplies accountability will also be 
monitored.  At the study closeout, the monitors confirm that all data have been reviewed, all source 
documents have been verified, and all required documents are present in the Study Regulatory File.  The 
table below  describes the variables to be reviewed during monitoring visits.  
 
Variable  % of Records Reviewed  
Informed consents  100%  
Eligibility criteria for all screened subjects  100%  
Adverse events  100%  
Drug accountability  20% of active subjects  
Protocol adherence  20% of active subjects  
Verification of eCRFs with source documents  20% of active subjects  
26Nov2018  26  Central study files -inclusion of all applicable documents  100%  
Protocol deviations/violations  100%  
 
AEs will be reported to the IRB as detai led below. Adverse events will be recorded on the study data form 
by [CONTACT_3433] e study team . Any serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the investigator or designee  
immediately. Study forms and charts will be reviewed by [CONTACT_756067] 
[INVESTIGATOR_756025].  All identified AEs will be recorded . The investigator will determine the grade and 
attribution.  If unblinding is required, the investigator will notify the IRB. The protocol and consent will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_756068]. SAE’s that are related to th e study  
and unexpected will be reported to the IRB and FDA.  Any serious adverse events and/or adverse events 
that occur during the study will be followed to resolution.  
 
For the purpose of this study, toxicity is defined using the Common Terminology Criter ia for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) v4.0 as defined by [CONTACT_29630] 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ).  
 
Grade level 4 or greater toxicity which are unexpected and related to th e study will  be reported to the 
IRB within 48 hours. Examples pertinent to this protocol include: life threatening respi[INVESTIGATOR_756026], anaphylaxis, hypotension, hypertensive crisis, life -threatening 
cardiac arrhythmias requiring  urgent intervention, nausea and emesis with life -threatening 
consequences, and change in mental status including states harmful to the subject.  
 
Subjects will be withdrawn from study  drug exposure if  any of the following events occur during the 
patient’s  stay in the ED:  
▪ The subject has a SAE possibly or definitely related to the study drug  
▪ The subject experiences a level 4 toxicity as defined by [CONTACT_3989]  
▪ The subject experiences one or more level 3 toxicities as defined by [CONTACT_3989]  
▪ The subject has an adverse ev ent experience that would, in the investigator’s judgment, make 
continued participation in the study not in the subject’s best medical interest.  
 
The trial will stop enrollment for the following events:  
▪ A SAE rate related to the study intervention of great er than or equal to 2 in 10 subjects is detected  
▪ Subjects experiencing grade  [ADDRESS_1034790] party payers and participants will not be billed for rese arch procedures described.  
 
XVI. PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION  
 
Participants who complete the ED study procedures will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_1034791] for their 
time and effort towards the study.

Ketamine Human Pharmacokinetics  
▪ Nielsen, et al in 2014  investigated a pediatric formulation of intranasal sufentanil 0.5 mcg/kg 
and ketamine 0.5 mg/kg for procedural pain and dete rmined the bioavailability of ketamine was 
35.8%.  Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ketamine was 0.102 mg/L (CV 10.8%) and 
Tmax was 8.5 min (CV 17.3%).  
 
▪ Malinovsky, et al in 1996 determined that after intranasal ketamine in children 10 -30 kg, 2 -9 
years of age, mean plasma concentrations after 3 mg/kg peaked at 496 ng/mL at 20 minutes and 
after 9 mg/kg peaked at 2104 ng/mL within 21 minutes.  Plasma concentrations of norketamine 
(the predominate metabolite), peaked at ~120 minutes after nasal ketamine.  Calculated 
bioavailability from nasal administration was 0.5.  The authors concluded that nasal 
administration of low doses of ketamine produced plasma concentrations associated with 
analgesia, but using high doses produced high plasma concentrations simi lar to those that 
induce anesthesia.  
Dosing:  
Children:  
IM: 3 to 7 mg/kg  
IV: Range: 0.5 to 2 mg/kg, use smaller doses (0.5 to 1 mg/kg) for sedation for minor procedures; 
usual induction dosage: 1 to 2 mg/kg  
Adults:  
IM: 3 to 8 mg/kg  
IV: Range: 1 to 4.5 mg/kg; usual induction dosage: 1 to 2 mg/kg

Fentanyl Human Pharmacokine tics 
▪ Onset of action: Analgesia: Intranasal: Children 3 -12 years: 5 -10 minutes (Borland, 2002)  
▪ Half-life:  Nasal spray: 15 -25 hours (based on a multiple -dose pharmacokinetic study when doses 
are administered in the same nostril and separated by a 1 -, 2-, or 4-hour time lapse)  
▪ Time to peak serum concentration: Nasal spray: Median: 15 -21 minutes  
Dosing : 
Infants and Children:  
Acute pain:  IV: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naive:  
Infants:  Limited data available: Initial: 1 -2 mcg/kg/dose; may repeat at 2 -4 hour intervals; 
in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -tolerant or younger infants, titration to higher doses may be required (up to 4 
mcg/kg/dose) (Hegenbarth, 2008; Nelson, 1996; WHO, 2012)  
Children:  Limited data a vailable in children <2 years: Initial: 1 -2 mcg/kg/dose; may repeat 
at 30 - to 60 -minute intervals; in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -tolerant children, titration to higher doses may be 
required (Hegenbarth, 2008; Nelson, 1996; WHO, 2012)  
Analgesia for minor procedures/sedation:  Limited data available in children <2 years:  
IM, IV:  1-2 mcg/kg/dose; administer 3 minutes before the procedure; maximum dose: 50 
mcg; may repeat 1/2 original dose every 3 -5 minutes if necessary; titrate to effect 
(Cramton, 2012; Krauss, 2006; Zeltzer, 1990 ) 
Intranasal (using parenteral preparation):  Limited data available: Infants and Children ≥10 
kg: 1.5 mcg/kg once (maximum: 100 mcg/dose); reported range: 1 -2 mcg/kg; some 
studies that used an initial dose of 1.5 mcg/kg allowed for additional incremental d oses 
of 0.3 -0.5 mcg/kg to be administered every 5 minutes, not to exceed a total dose of 3 
mcg/kg depending on pain type and severity (Borland, 2002; Borland, 2005; Borland, 
2007; Chung, 2010; Cole, 2009; Crellin, 2010; Herd, 2009; Manjushree, 2002; Saunde rs, 
2010)  
Adolescents and Adults:  
Analgesia for minor procedures/sedation:   
IV: 0.5-1 mcg/kg/dose; may repeat after 30 -60 minutes; or 25 -50 mcg, repeat full dose in 
5 minutes if needed, may repeat 4 -5 times with 25 mcg at 5 -minute intervals if needed.

1. Statement  of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be 
tested. 
We plan to conduct a double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of naltrexone 
for extended release injectable suspension (VIVITROL®/XR-NTX) and counseling on highly 
active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) medication adherence in a cohort of HIV-infected 
patients who report heavy drinking, or meet criteria for alcohol abuse and/or dependence, and 
inadequate (< 95%) HAART adherence. All patients will receive a behavioral intervention, 
termed Medical Management/Medication Coaching or MM/MC. MM/MC incorporates the 
behavioral platform Medical Management (MM) from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse 
and Alcoholism (NIAAA)-funded COMBINE Study to reduce heavy alcohol use with 
Medication Coaching (MC), a manualized treatment designed to improve HAART medication 
adherence in HIV-infected patients with substance use disorders. 
The specific aims and hypotheses of the study are as follows:
Specific Aim 1: To compare the efficacy of VIVITROL +MM/MC versus placebo +MM/MC on 
adherence to HAART. 
Hypothesis 1: VIVITROL +MM/MC will lead to improved adherence to HAART when 
compared to placebo + MM/MC. 
Specific Aim 2:  To compare the efficacy of VIVITROL +MM/MC versus placebo +MM/MC in 
reducing days of heavy drinking. 
Hypothesis 2:  VIVITROL +MM/MC will lead to greater reductions in the number of days of 
heavy drinking when compared to placebo + MM/MC.
Specific Aim 3 (Exploratory): To explore the effect of VIVITROL +MM/MC versus placebo 
+MM/MC on biologic and psychosocial outcomes including:
3a) HIV  markers—viral mutations (using standard assays and ultra-deep sequencing), CD4 
lymphocyte count and HIV RNA viral load; and 
3b) Liver function tests
3c) Depression,  anxiety, pain, and quality of life 
2.   Background:  Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. 
Provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data. 
Heavy drinking and alcohol use and dependence are common in HIV-infected 
individuals and are associated with poor HAART medication adherence and disease 
progression
The lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorders in patients with HIV ranges from 22% to 
60% [2, 12-14]. In a national sample of patients with HIV, 8% to12% were classified as heavy 
drinkers, a rate approximately twice that of the U.S. national average [3, 15]. The rates are

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/11/2018 VALID THROUGH 10/13/2019Version 12/14/2012 Page 9 of 55even higher for a diagnosis of lifetime alcohol use disorders with estimates of 26% to 60% in 
people living with HIV/AIDS as compared with 14% to 24% in the general population [16-
20].
The impact of alcohol use on HIV treatment outcomes is substantial. Patients with 
alcohol use disorders delay seeking treatment for HIV [21]. Alcohol problems in HIV-infected 
patients are associated with poor adherence to HAART medications [1-6]. While HAART 
adherence in the general HIV-infected population ranges from 60% to 70% [22, 23], estimates 
for adherence in HIV-infected at-risk drinkers is significantly lower at 42% [24]. The risk for 
non-adherence has been shown to increase with increasing levels of alcohol consumption with 
one study revealing a 1.7 times increase in non-adherence in heavy drinkers (OR, 1.7 (95% 
CI, 1.3-2.3)) and a 2.7 times increase in non-adherence in frequent heavy drinkers (OR, 2.7 
(1.7-4.5)) [25]. A recent study using the Veteran’s Aging Cohort (VACS) (a large NIAAA-
funded national sample of HIV-infected and HIV-negative patients affiliated with the current 
proposal) examining the relationship between alcohol consumption and medication adherence 
found a strong temporal inverse dose response association between alcohol and adherence. 
Adherence was lower on days in which patients drank heavily, and on the following day. The 
effect of alcohol was most pronounced in HIV-infected individuals, with an odds ratio for 
non-adherence of 1.8 in non-binge drinkers and 4.3 in binge drinkers [26].  In this study, 
alcohol consumption was the most significant predictor of HAART medication adherence 
(p=0.0001) with the greatest adherence associated with recent abstinence from alcohol. These 
findings support the argument that any reduction in heavy drinking may have a positive effect 
on HAART adherence. Heavy drinking in HIV-infected patients is also associated with poor 
treatment response as evidenced by [CONTACT_908125]4 lymphocyte counts and higher HIV RNA [4, 
5]. In turn, it has been shown that individuals who have stopped drinking have an improved 
response to HIV therapy [4]. 
HAART non-adherence is linked to heavy drinking and can lead to increased rates of 
viral mutations, including minor resistance variants 
The advent of HAART has revolutionized outcomes in HIV treatment [27]. As discussed 
above, ongoing untreated heavy drinking is strongly associated with poor HAART adherence 
and in turn suboptimal HAART adherence not only leads to HIV progression but also to HIV 
drug resistance [28, 29]. This drug resistance diminishes the effectiveness of HAART 
treatment for individual patients and for individuals subsequently infected with these viral 
strains. HIV drug resistance is the consequence of mutations that arise in the viral proteins 
targeted by [CONTACT_908126] (ARV) medications [30, 31]. Resistance can occur as a result of 
incomplete adherence to HAART or through sexual or injection drug-related transmission 
events. The mutations that occur during ARV exposure can cause resistance to a single ARV 
or can cause cross-resistance within an entire class of ARVs. HIV drug resistance leads to 
virologic failure (inability to suppress HIV virus) and limits future therapeutic options. 
Additionally, from a public health perspective, the transmission of drug-resistant HIV is of 
growing concern. Ten to 15% of new HIV infections are with drug- resistant virus which can 
limit treatment options [32]. HIV infection in patients exists as viral quasi-species, a 
collection of genetically diverse viral strains. Not all the viral strains that make up the 
collection in a person are detected by [CONTACT_908127]. Standard assays only detect drug-resistant HIV if it makes up at least 20% of the 
viral population. Recent data suggest that minor resistant variants, constituting as little as 1% 
of viral quasi-species or “swarm” in a patient, are clinically important and can proliferate after 
the introduction of a new antiretroviral medication, leading to treatment failure [33, 34].  
Recent data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [35] demonstrate 
that high-sensitivity genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_908081]-infected patients and in chronically HIV-

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/11/2018 VALID THROUGH 10/13/2019Version 12/14/2012 Page 10 of 55infected patients receiving ARVs nearly doubles. The detection of these minor resistant 
variants in the CDC study was strongly associated with future virologic failure on ARVs [35]. 
These CDC investigators recommend screening for minor resistant variants in HIV-infected 
patients [36]. They had developed allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to 
detect 9 resistance mutations. However, there are ~200 mutations associated with HIV drug 
resistance. New technologies that enable screening for all the HIV resistance mutations that 
contribute to drug resistance are needed. One such technology is ultra-deep sequencing. This 
technology, which we plan to use in the current study, employs microfabricated high-density 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_908082] (<1%) levels in patient samples [37, 38].
Liver injury is central to morbidity and mortality in HIV and is impacted by [CONTACT_908128] 
[39]. We have also shown that these levels of injury are common among HIV-infected 
patients in care; due to multiple causes including alcohol, viral hepatitis, ARV treatment 
toxicity, and, likely, non-ARV medication (e.g. statins) toxicity.  Morbidity and mortality 
associated with alcohol-induced liver injury is well described and is marked by [CONTACT_908129], leading to cirrhosis and its complications [1].  Among 
individuals with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection, regular alcohol abuse or dependence 
contributes to an increased risk of cirrhosis, liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, 
and death [5].  Although hepatocellular injury is increasingly recognized as a particularly 
important source of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected individuals, it is largely 
ascribed to co-existing viral hepatitis and medication-associated hepatotoxicity (e.g., ARV 
medications).  The additive impact of varying, and even low levels, of alcohol consumption 
on progression of this injury is not clear.  Prior work from our group has revealed that liver 
injury and fibrosis increase across increasing levels of alcohol consumption (p<0.0001). 
Significant increases in advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis are found at all levels of alcohol 
exposure among individuals with HIV mono-infection (8.6%), HCV mono-infection (13.8%), 
and HCV-HIV co-infection (31.8%).  In multivariate analysis, after controlling for HCV and 
HIV infections, alcohol abuse or dependence represented the strongest predictor of advanced 
fibrosis (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.83-3.09) [40].  
The gold standard diagnostic tool for assessing liver injury and fibrosis is a liver biopsy, 
although this is limited by [CONTACT_908130], sampling error, and inter and intra-
observer variability in histologic interpretation, and is not practical for large research studies.  
In this setting, non-invasive approaches to assessing liver fibrosis represent important and 
clinically useful surrogates for distinguishing mild versus advanced liver fibrosis, and have 
been validated across liver disease populations.  One commonly used index marker is FIB-4

benefits for this population.
Heavy drinking is associated with increased sexual risk behaviors in those who are HIV-
infected
Sexual risk behaviors (e.g. sexual intercourse without condom use, multiple sexual 
partners) that accompany alcohol use in HIV-infected individuals have major public health 
implications given the predominant role that sexual transmission plays in the current HIV 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_901] [43-46]. Alcohol use at any level is associated with increased sexual risk behaviors 
[43]. Work from our group indicates a close temporal relationship between alcohol 
consumption and sexual risk behavior among HIV-infected individuals [47]. Among sexually 
active HIV-infected men, intoxication before intercourse was significantly associated with 
having [ADDRESS_1274652] year (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.1-2.8), inconsistent condom use (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7), and the combined 
measure of 2 or more partners and inconsistent condom use (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). The 
evidence for the impact of the treatment of alcohol use disorders on decreasing sexual risk 
behaviors is mixed. There is data that those entering treatment for alcohol problems have 
declines in risky behaviors with an increase in condom use and a decrease in the number of 
sexual partners and high-risk partners [46]. Patients who completely abstain from alcohol use 
for the year following treatment have the greatest reductions in these behaviors. In turn, other 
studies have shown no change in the prevalence of sexual risk behaviors among individuals 
entering treatment for alcohol use disorders [46, 48]. To our knowledge, there is no data on 
the impact of alcohol treatment on sexual risk in HIV-infected patients.  Therefore there is a 
need to assess how suppressing alcohol use, especially when it is linked to risky sex, impacts 
on the rates of sexual risk behavior in heavy drinking HIV-infected individuals.
NTX is an effective treatment for alcohol problems but has not been systematically 
examined
 in HIV-infected individuals
Effective pharmacologic approaches to treating alcohol dependence are currently 
available yet no data exists on these treatments in HIV-infected individuals. NTX is an opi[INVESTIGATOR_908084]-approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Clinical trials have 
demonstrated success in preventing relapse among alcohol dependent patients treated with 
NTX [7, 8] and decreased drinking in those with heavy or problem drinking [49-52], however, 
these studies have almost universally excluded HIV-infected patients. A pooled analysis of 
two such studies conducted in alcohol dependent individuals concluded that treatment with 
NTX as compared to placebo resulted in a 36% reduction in non-abstinent drinking rates and a 
50% reduction in rates of relapse to heavy drinking [53]. A Cochrane Collaborative Group 
systematic review of opi[INVESTIGATOR_908085] 27 randomized 
controlled trials of NTX and found that short-term (up to 3 months) and medium-term (3 to 12 
months) treatment lead to improved alcohol use outcomes [54]. While one trial concluded that 
NTX treatment for alcohol dependence offered no benefits over placebo, this trial enrolled 
only individuals with severe and chronic alcohol dependence and therefore these findings are 
not generalizable to a population that includes those with heavy drinking [55]. 
NTX has also been shown to decrease drinking behavior in studies conducted by [CONTACT_908131] a primary care model [56] [57]. The 
COMBINE Study [10] also examined the efficacy of NTX alone, and in combination with 
acamprosate, and counseling interventions in a large multi-site trial in HIV-negative patients. 
In this study, participants were randomized to receive placebo, NTX, or acamprosate alone or 
in combination. Some participants received Medical Management (MM) provided by a health 
care practitioner with or without Combined Behavioral Intervention provided by a trained 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. NTX reduced the risk of a heavy drinking day (hazard ratio, 0.72; 97.5% CI, 0.53-

Despi[INVESTIGATOR_908086]-infected individuals and 
the demonstrated benefit of NTX and counseling in HIV-negative heavy drinkers, there has 
not been a systematic evaluation of the impact of this treatment on HIV outcomes or of the 
efficacy and tolerability of NTX in HIV-infected patients. This lack of evidence means that 
HIV-infected patients who are heavy drinkers are unlikely to receive the potential benefits of 
NTX and counseling.  The current trial will provide evidence on the efficacy of NTX in this 
important and vulnerable population.
Extended release naltrexone is well tolerated and addresses adherence 
Patient adherence to oral NTX can predict treatment response [8, 58, 59].  To address this 
concern, an extended release formulation of naltrexone (XR-NTX; VIVITROL®Alkermes, 
Inc., Waltham MA, [LOCATION_003]) has been developed.  The extended release formulation is 
administered once every 4 weeks as an intramuscular injection and shows pharmacological 
properties consistent with oral naltrexone. The extended release formulation is generally well 
tolerated; and as with oral naltrexone, the most common side effects are nausea, headache and 
fatigue.  In addition, given that many patients with HIV are taking a number of medications, 
the extended release formulation possesses the advantage of not adding to their pi[INVESTIGATOR_13551]. In 
terms of efficacy, in one clinical trial, the 380mg dosage of extended release intramuscular 
VIVITROL in combination with psychosocial therapy was shown to reduce the heavy 
drinking rate by 25% compared with placebo (p = .03). In a subgroup of patients who were 
abstinent for at least four days prior to treatment initiation [60], extended release naltrexone 
resulted in significant improvements in rate of abstinence, time to first drink, and decreased 
the number of heavy drinking days per month compared to placebo (p<0.04). Three early 
studies of oral NTX demonstrated that the effect of NTX on relapse to heavy drinking fades in 
the months following treatment, whereas extended release VIVITROL appears to improve 
drinking outcome over a period of 18 months [61].  Therefore, the current trial will provide 
evidence for the efficacy of naltrexone treatment using a paradigm designed to help assure 
adherence to alcohol pharmacotherapy and is consistent with care provided in an HIV primary 
care clinic.
Why NTX and not other alcohol pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]?
Naltrexone has demonstrated efficacy in patients who meet criteria for alcohol abuse and 
dependence [54] and in those with heavy drinking [49-52, 62].  While NTX should be used 
with caution in patients with severe liver disease (see B.11 Medical concerns of NTX 
treatment in HIV-infected individuals below) we believe the hepatic safety profile of extended 
release VIVITROL [63] and the stepwise approach that we have outlined, with ongoing 
surveillance for side effects and hepatotoxicity, will provide important safety data in this 
patient population.  One reason we have chosen NTX  as the medication in this proposal is 
that it may be a better treatment option for heavy drinkers who do not identify themselves as 
alcohol dependent or who do not have abstinence as a treatment goal [64]. D isulfiram  is more 
appropriate for patients who wish to abstain completely from alcohol, although its efficacy in 
this regard is suspect [65].  Unlike disulfiram, NTX does not have adverse interactions with 
alcohol so it can be initiated in patients who are not abstinent.  NTX has a favorable side 
effect profile and has been shown to reduce the risk of heavy drinking in the majority of 
clinical trials [54, 66, 67]. Most of the studies evaluating the use of NTX have demonstrated 
reduced drinking [51, 52, 61, 62, 68]. NTX has demonstrated efficacy even in heavy drinkers 
who are not necessarily motivated to decrease their alcohol consumption.  For instance, 
drinking data obtained from smokers enrolled in a trial of NTX for smoking cessation 
revealed reduced heavy drinking indicating that motivation to change drinking does not have

Naltrexone also appears to result in greater reductions in alcohol consumption than other 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_412142].  The COMBINE study 
examined different combinations of NTX and acamprosate along with different behavioral 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_908087] [10]. This study showed that patients who received MM with NTX, 
or with a combined behavioral intervention (CBI), or with both, had greater reductions in 
heavy drinking compared to MM and placebo NTX, and that there was no benefit of 
acamprosate compared to placebo whether provided with MM only or MM plus CBI. Further, 
a recently completed study evaluating the efficacy of acamprosate for maintaining abstinence 
in alcohol dependent patients found in an intention-to-treat analysis the percentage of 
abstinent days did not differ from placebo [70]. Finally, topi[INVESTIGATOR_908088] a 
pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence [71].  However, topi[INVESTIGATOR_908089] P450 
(CYO450) metabolism with many antiretroviral agents (although by a different isoform) and 
can be associated with significant side effects.  In one recent study, approximately half of the 
subjects who discontinued topi[INVESTIGATOR_908090] a limiting adverse event.  In this placebo-controlled 
trial, subjects receiving topi[INVESTIGATOR_908091] (51% of subjects), 
taste perversion (23%), anorexia (20%), difficulty with concentration (15%), nervousness 
(15%), dizziness (12%), and pruritis (10%). These side effects are likely to limit topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]’s 
utility in HIV-infected patients who are already exposed to an array of side effects from their 
HAART and other medications.
The rationale for focusing on HAART medication adherence in heavy drinkers 
We have chosen HAART adherence as our primary HIV outcome because it is one of the 
most proximal steps in the pathway between alcohol consumption and poor HIV outcomes.  
The association between HAART adherence and HIV treatment outcomes is well- established 
[72, 73].  However, the optimal level of HAART adherence is not known. Nonetheless, it has 
been shown that the highest levels of adherence (>95%) are an appropriate goal [74] and if not 
attainable, incremental increases in adherence at levels < 95% should be considered 
worthwhile endpoints [75-77]. Therefore, in the current study we are evaluating HAART 
adherence in terms of the proportion of patients achieving 95% or greater HAART adherence. 
The threshold of 95% adherence is used because of its consistent association with improved 
clinical, virological, and immunological outcomes [74]. Although one could argue that lesser 
levels of adherence might produce a satisfactory viral load response, particularly with certain 
types of HAART regimens (e.g., non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based 
regimens) [29], 95% remains a standard target for HAART adherence and is therefore the 
most compelling choice for a primary adherence measure. Furthermore, lower adherence 
levels (e.g. 80%), while potentially resulting in adequate viral load suppression, run the risk of 
increasing the danger of accumulating HIV resistance mutations and decreasing future 
treatment options. Indeed, studies have suggested that the maximum rate of accruing 
resistance mutations accrues in the range of 70-80% [78, 79]. This finding reinforces our 
rationale for choosing greater than 95% HAART adherence as the primary outcome measure. 
In the context of alcohol use, one study found that in HIV-infected patients, there was no 
difference in biological markers between non-drinking and drinking patients receiving 
HAART [1]. A second study showed that in HIV-infected patients, there was no difference in 
biological markers in all drinking groups not on HAART, but drinkers on HAART had worse 
markers than drinkers not on HAART [5]. Possible explanations include the effect of alcohol 
on the immune system, alcohol-related liver toxicity, drug interactions between alcohol and 
HAART medications, and the behavioral effects of alcohol on HAART adherence. While 
there may be several pathways in which NTX may improve HIV outcomes (Figure 1) the 
other HIV outcome data we are collecting for each step of these pathways will inform the 
potential contribution of each step.

Pharmacy refill provides an accurate measure of HAART adherence and refill 
“persistence” is valid, reliable, and linked to clinical outcomes in HIV 
Measuring HAART adherence can be challenging and can include self-report, pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], 
and electronic monitoring.  One additional assessment of adherence that is amenable to 
measurement, and will be used in the current trial, is “persistence”.  Persistence is defined as 
the continuous refill of prescribed medications using pharmacy data. Persistence can be 
conceptualized as necessary, though not sufficient, for adherence to occur.  Without the filling 
and refilling of medications, patients can not adhere to their medications. Unlike other 
adherence measurements such as self-report, pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], or electronic monitoring, persistence 
is an objective measure that does not rely on provider or patient action to obtain. It can also be 
updated easily so as to avoid the pi[INVESTIGATOR_908092] a single point 
in time and miss their later non-adherence [75]. Persistence has been used to measure patients’ 
adherence to HAART [80], to NTX for alcohol treatment [81] and to investigate refill 
behaviors with drug regimens such as statins and anti-hypertensive medications used for other 
chronic diseases [82, 83]. There are a number of ways that pharmacy refill data can be 
analyzed to create persistence measures of adherence.  The medication possession ratio 
(MPR) is a commonly used metric that has been validated with virologic response [84-86]. It 
is calculated as the days’ supply of medication divided by [CONTACT_908132] a patient can 
attain over a defined refill period. The MPR has the capacity to detect inconsistent adherence 
patterns, is low-cost and has been validated [87]. Within HIV, pharmacy refill of HAART has 
been used to characterize the following associations:  CD4 levels and HAART initiation [88], 
intermittent use of HAART and mortality [72], as well as HAART adherence and virologic 
response [89].

(MC) counseling in conjunction with NTX
The role of counseling is well-established in the care of patients with alcohol problems.  
MM is a largely medical approach to counseling which is appealing because of its familiarity 
to practitioners and ease of implementation in a setting that does not routinely provide 
addiction treatment (e.g. HIV clinic).  This type of approach is consistent with studies 
evaluating psychoeducational counseling in patients with diabetes, hypertension, asthma or 
congestive heart failure suggesting that intensive education about a patients medical condition 
and advice about disease management improves treatment effectiveness [90-98].  
HIV primary care  clinics often provide onsite care for comorbid medical conditions including 
psychiatric conditions, HCV, and most recently opi[INVESTIGATOR_908093] [99]. 
Onsite treatment of alcohol use disorders in patients with HIV would allow for integrated care 
for both disorders. Our earlier work in primary care compared NTX combined with “primary 
care management” versus NTX combined with cognitive behavior therapy and found similar 
results between the two treatments during the initial 10 weeks of treatment [57]. The 
feasibility and efficacy of combining MM with NTX was also documented in the COMBINE 
Study [10].  For the proposed study we will provide MM along with counseling, termed 
Medication Coaching (MC) [11], designed to enhance HAART medication adherence in HIV-
infected individuals with substance use disorders.  We have used an earlier version of MC as 
an adjunct to drug counseling in HIV-infected opi[INVESTIGATOR_908094] [100, 101].
Medical concerns of NTX treatment in HIV-infected individuals
Increased prevalence of hepatitis C (HCV)
Because of its potential for hepatotoxicity, NTX should be used with caution in 
individuals with impaired hepatic function. We plan to use low, but effective doses of NTX, 
and to assess hepatic safety using a standard self report form [102] and serial serum 
transaminases in the proposed study.  Approximately 30% of HIV-infected individuals in the 
U.S. are co-infected with HCV [103].  HIV has a significant effect on the progression of HCV 
to severe liver disease [104-106].  After [ADDRESS_1274653] a 25% risk of cirrhosis, while those with HCV alone have only a 6.5% risk 
[105]. Co-infection may increase the risk but not the severity of hepatotoxicity from HAART 
medication, and therefore HAART should not be avoided in these individuals, but 
transaminases need careful monitoring [103, 107, 108]. VIVITROL can also have hepatotoxic 
effects, though at higher dosages than will be used in the proposed study. A recent large study 
of extended release VIVITROL found that mean liver enzymes did not change significantly 
over the course of treatment and there was no effect of medication on the proportion of 
patients in the different groups who had liver enzyme elevations higher than several times the 
upper limit of normal [61]. In addition, it has been found to be safe for use in patients with 
mild to moderate liver impairment [109] with evidence of a 15% greater reduction in liver 
enzyme levels in the VIVITROL group as compared with the placebo group [110]. 
VIVITROL is approved for use in patients who meet criteria for Child-Pugh classification A 
and B indicating tolerance in patients with impaired hepatic function.  While these data are 
reassuring, monitoring of liver function, to assess for hepatotoxicity, will be important, 
especially in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.
Lower tolerance for medication interactions and side effects (NTX and HAART) 
While there is little literature on interactions between NTX and HAART, based on 
previous studies outlining metabolism of NTX, these interactions appear to be minimal. The 
majority of HAART medications are metabolized via the CYP450 system. This metabolic 
pathway is known to lead to drug interactions with a number of medication classes. NTX, 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/11/2018 VALID THROUGH 10/13/2019
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/11/2018 VALID THROUGH 10/13/2019Version 12/14/2012 Page 16 of 55however, is not completely metabolized via CYP450 and therefore significant interactions are 
not expected [111, 112]. One study on the disposition of zidovudine (AZT) found that NTX 
had no significant effect on the area under the curve, maximal concentration or half-life of 
AZT [113]. In turn, another study suggested that NTX might potentiate the antiviral effects of 
AZT and a protease inhibitor, Indinavir, increasing their antiviral activity 2-3 fold [9]. A 
recent study suggests that NTX may inhibit the alcohol-mediated enhancement of HIV 
infection in T lymphocytes [114]. In addition, a large multi-center safety study of the use of 
NTX for alcoholism in 865 individuals, including patients with comorbid psychiatric illness 
and HIV, demonstrated that serious side effects in these populations were uncommon [115]. 
While this study was not randomized and was not intended to look at medication interactions, 
the findings are reassuring for patients with HIV disease. The proposed study will examine the 
question of clinically significant medication interactions through laboratory assessments and a 
systematic evaluation of adverse effects.
Addressing HIV provider’s concern regarding provision of NTX for alcohol problems 
Physicians cite a number of barriers to providing NTX for the treatment of alcohol use 
disorders including lack of knowledge of the medication’s safety and efficacy, time for patient 
management, and overall lack of involvement in alcoholism treatment [116-119].  The model 
proposed in the current study, alcohol treatment that is integrated into the HIV care setting, 
has potential to address some of these concerns.  Integrated treatment for HIV and substance 
abuse disorders has been shown to help ameliorate some of the problems with access to care 
and sub-optimal treatment for both conditions [12, 120]. While integration of these services 
can be implemented at various levels including at that of the provider, the clinic, or the 
system, any successful integration will require support of providers based on treatment 
efficacy. The goal of the proposed study is to provide clinicians with data on the efficacy of 
VIVITROL in HIV-infected patients in order to reassure them about its tolerability and utility.   
3.   Research Plan: Provide an orderly scientific description of the study design and research 
procedures as they directly affect the subjects. 
Overview 
The proposed study of HIV-infected patients with inadequate HAART adherence and 
heavy drinking, alcohol abuse and dependence will consist of a 24-week double-blind 
placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, with an additional [ADDRESS_1274654] of treatment with VIVITROL versus placebo in conjunction with a 
counseling intervention on HIV outcomes.  HIV outcomes will include: HAART medication 
adherence (specifically the proportion of patients achieving 95% or greater HAART 
adherence, viral mutations, HIV biologic markers, and alcohol-HAART hepatotoxicity. The 
counseling intervention is a “compound” therapy consisting of Medical Management (MM) 
counseling and Medication Coaching (MC).  MM was developed for the NIAAA-funded 
COMBINE Study and consists of a series of brief interventions delivered by [CONTACT_908133] (physician or nurse) that has demonstrated efficacy when combined with NTX to 
reduce the frequency of heavy drinking [10].  MC is a counseling strategy which focuses on 
HAART medication adherence in substance abusing populations [11]. Of the total study 
population of 154 patients, 50 patients will be enrolled in the study at Yale and will be 
randomized to receive one of two treatment conditions: VIVITROL + MM/MC versus 
Placebo + MM/MC. MM/MC is intended to approximate the type of treatment that would be 
suitable for implementation by a trained individual (e.g. physician, nurse, nurse practitioner, 
physician assistant,) in a HIV primary care setting and approximates the counseling 
interventions that we have implemented in opi[INVESTIGATOR_908095] [122] and HIV primary care settings [100].

emergency.
Collection of Patient Locator Information: Retention and tracking strategies developed in the 
NIAAA Project Match and previously used by [CONTACT_908134] [122, 124]. [CONTACT_169563]’s connections with the clinics from which patients will be

try all the locators as well as investigate the support systems noted on the index visit. Subjects 
will also receive compensation for completing assessments during treatment and at the 9-
month and 12-month follow-up.
  
Pretreatment Assessment: The baseline interview will include evaluations for alcohol, drug, 
and psychiatric disorders, a physical examination, blood work, urine sample and pregnancy 
test for women. 
Randomization: Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to VIVITROL + MM/MC or 
placebo + MM/MC by [CONTACT_274665]. All staff, other than this individual and 
the study biostatistician(s), will be blind to treatment allocation. Subjects will be assigned to 
one of the two conditions using stratified randomization. There will be 6 strata: (a) 
participating clinic (3) and (b) alcohol abuse/dependence (Yes/No; 2) in the randomization 
scheme.
Treatment
Medication: VIVITROL versus placebo: 
Medication: VIVITROL versus placebo: Participants will receive either active VIVITROL or 
placebo throughout the 24-week treatment period; they will be told that they have a 50% 
chance of receiving the active drug. Those assigned to the VIVITROL arm will receive 
monthly extended release VIVITROL doses at 380mg (4 mL), administered as an 
intramuscular gluteal injection at 4-week intervals. Consistent with prior studies [60], we will 
encourage patients to be abstinent from alcohol use for four days or more prior to receiving 
the dose of extended release VIVITROL.   We chose the 380mg dose because it was found in 
a recent randomized trial to be more efficacious than a 190mg dose with no significant 
differences in side effects or rates of hepatotoxicity. For the placebo arm of the study, patients 
will be dosed in a similar manner receiving 4 mL injections of placebo at 4-week intervals. 
All active and placebo doses will be administered by [CONTACT_74309]. 
Counseling Intervention: Our compound counseling intervention will consist of two 
efficacious, manualized behavioral treatments intended to augment VIVITROL’s effects: 
Medical
 Management (MM) and Medication Coaching (MC).  MM is a manual-guided 
supportive counseling therapy with demonstrated effectiveness (see the COMBINE Study 
[10] , Appendix B).  This treatment incorporates the clinical skills and advice used by [CONTACT_908135] 10/11/2018 VALID THROUGH 10/13/2019
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/11/2018 VALID THROUGH 10/13/2019Version 12/14/[ADDRESS_1274659] of: discussion of medical concerns, information on VIVITROL, 
assessment of medication compliance, provision of written educational materials on alcohol 
problems and treatment, and a question/answer period. The core elements covered at each 
follow-up MM visit are: 1) Medical status, medication safety, medication adherence,  2) 
Drinking status, and  3) Troubleshooting based on patients’ drinking and medication 
adherence status. Each follow-up visit will include approximately 10-15 minutes of MM 
counseling. 
Medication Coaching (MC) is a counseling strategy focusing on HAART medication 
adherence
 in substance abusing populations [11] (Appendix C), an early version of which we 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_908097]-infected patients [100, 101]. This counseling uses ten strategies to 
increase medication adherence during the intervention and promote long-term maintenance:  
1) assessing adherence, 2) designing an individual adherence management plan, 3) 
coordinating with medical care, 4) collaborating with other team members (e.g., substance 
abuse counseling), 5) developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a medication routine, 6) addressing barriers, 7) providing 
feedback on health outcomes, 8) maintaining adherence, 9) reducing HIV progression, and 10) 
promoting continued adherence and assessing goals.  Each follow-up visit will include 
approximately 10-[ADDRESS_1274660]-enrollment.  Each of these visits will be guided by a structured initial visit or 
progress note.  
The treatments will be delivered consecutively within each session by a trained primary 
care practitioner (e.g., nurse), with the exception of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_908098].  For example, we have selected the more detailed 
adherence assessment from the MM and adapted it to include antiretroviral medications, 
followed by [CONTACT_908136] (e.g., cueing strategies, building social support for adherence) taken from the MC.  
We have also adapted the MM by [CONTACT_908137], further caveats about liver 
disease, and the adverse medical consequences of using alcohol when HIV-infected. Finally, 
we have incorporated brief strategies for addressing possible concerns about stigma when 
trying to engage clients in support groups for abstinence.
Adherence to the MM and MC manuals, as well as competence/performance of the 
practitioners, will be assessed throughout the study during weekly supervision and through 
ratings of audiotapes evaluated by [CONTACT_908138], using rating forms to assess time 
spent with the patient, content material reviewed, and proficiency of the provider at each 
session.
Study Period: The study period will be [ADDRESS_1274661] 
study of extended release VIVITROL conducted to date followed outcomes over 24 weeks of 
active treatment [61]. In addition, this period will give adequate time for us to detect 
differences in adherence, biologic markers (e.g. CD4 lymphocyte counts, HIV RNA, and 
alcohol and HAART hepatotoxicity) that may emerge. Given that there is some evidence 
VIVITROL treatment effects do not persist at follow-up after treatment [10], we are planning 
to conduct follow-up assessments at 9 months and 12 months.

from the electronic medical record maintained on all patients at the NSC over the past two 
years, the prevalence of alcohol abuse and dependence in patients receiving their care in the 
NSC was 139/775 or 18%. We suspect that this is an under-estimation of the actual 
prevalence. Of note, [CONTACT_169563] has been an HIV provider in the NSC for the past [ADDRESS_1274662] 7 years.
Assessments
Overview
We plan to assess a range of pretreatment measures at the baseline assessment to ensure 
that participants meet eligibility criteria and that important baseline and predictor variables are 
assessed (see Table 1 for Summary of Study Assessments).  Using validated instruments 
during treatment and at end-of-treatment, we will be able to examine the differential impact of 
VIVITROL on a range of measures, including medication adherence and standard 
assessments of alcohol consumption used across NIAAA studies of alcohol treatment. The 
primary study outcome is adherence to HAART medications. Secondary study outcomes 
include: 1) Frequency of heavy drinking; 2) HIV viral mutations; 3) Change in biological 
markers (CD4 lymphocyte counts and HIV RNA); 4) Alcohol-HAART hepatotoxicity; and 5) 
Sexual risk behaviors.
Baseline and in-treatment assessments
Prior to entrance into the study each patient will undergo a medical history, physical and 
laboratory assessments (Complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, and viral hepatitis 
serologies). A urine pregnancy test will be performed at baseline and each month thereafter and 
must be negative throughout the study. The research assistant will collect demographic data 
including items such as marital status, highest level of education completed, employment, 
substance use history, duration of HIV disease, and a detailed HAART medication history.  
Charts will be extracted to collect information including medical co-morbidities, prior CD4 
lymphocyte cell counts and HIV RNA levels, HAART medication history, historical 
genotypic information from prior HIV drug resistance testing, and patient satisfaction data.
HAART medication adherence, with the goal of determining the proportion of patients 
achieving 95% or greater HAART adherence, will be measured using pharmacy fill/refill data 
using the medication possession ratio defined as the total days supply/refill interval. 
Information needed to calculate the medication possession ratio is readily available in the 
patient’s pharmacy data. With subject written consent, we will call the pharmacy designated 
by [CONTACT_908139]. In addition, self-
reported HAART adherence will be collected using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 
assessment [128]. Patients will be asked how often they took each of their medications during 
the preceding month. We will also be conducting the Morisky 4-item adherence scale, a brief 
“persistence” measurement for medication persistence, and a single item visual analog scale 
for adherence. We will use a valid adjustment strategy [129] to resolve discrepancies between 
the various methods of assessing HAART adherence. The use of electronic drug monitoring in 
the form of medication event monitoring system (MEMS) caps for measuring HAART 
adherence was considered as it offers the best correlation with virologic outcomes  [130]. 
However, several documented disadvantages such as expense, lack of feasibility for most

dosing” their medication or removing more than one dose for each bottle opening, lead us to 
choose the other three methods in order to measure adherence [130]. 
We anticipate that a number of HIV-infected patients with heavy drinking may not be 
prescribed HAART medications due to their providers' concerns about poor medication 
adherence.  While such patients do not meet the second eligibility criterion, we will encourage 
interested patients to discuss the possibility of resuming HAART with their HIV providers, 
such that they could be considered for enrollment at a later date.  In addition, in an effort to 
include this target sub-population without mandating the usual 90 days of HAART-adherence 
data, we will determine their baseline adherence after 30 days; patients will be invited to 
present for an eligibility assessment one month after their first HAART prescription.  We will 
use a simple 30-day pi[INVESTIGATOR_908101].
The Morisky scale is a commonly used, validated, 4-item self-reported adherence measure 
that has been shown to be predictive of medication adherence. It includes two items that 
measure intentional medication non-adherence.
Alcohol Use will be assessed using the Time-Line Follow Back Interview (TLFB) [131] 
which will obtain the quantity/frequency of alcohol consumed for each day in the past month 
(baseline) and since the prior visit. TLFB has good test-retest reliability and good validity 
[131]. In addition, in order to better determine the “category” of drinking behavior of a subject 
at baseline, we will use the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [26], a valid 
instrument for categorizing alcohol consumption.
The Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) is a 14-item, self-administered 
questionnaire for characterizing and quantifying the obsessive and compulsive cognitive 
aspects of craving and heavy (alcoholic) drinking, such as drinking-related thought, urges to 
drink, and the ability to resist those thoughts and urges.
Phosphatidyl ethanol (PEth), a phospholipid formed only in the presence of alcohol, has 
shown 95-100% sensitivity and 100% specificity to detect heavy drinking over a period of 2-3 
weeks in several studies of dependent patients and abstainers in Europe.1-7  The detection of 
PEth appears to be dose-dependent.3, 6, 8, 9  The threshold for PEth is around 1000 grams over 
2-3 weeks with a mean daily intake of 50 grams (4.[ADDRESS_1274663] drinks).10  The identification of 
serum PEth will be performed by [CONTACT_60628]-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-
MS) as previously described.11, 12
Rates of viral mutations , according to International AIDS Society guidelines [132], will be 
determined by [CONTACT_908140]. We 
will also collect historical genotypic information through chart review. Our team has 
extensive experience in DNA sequencing techniques and has used these methods in HIV 
transmission risk studies [34, 133, 134]. For patients with a detectable viral load (>400 HIV 
RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) we will conduct standard HIV drug resistance testing [34, 133, 134] at 
baseline and follow up. Standard DNA sequencing will be performed using a consensus 
population sequencing of the HIV-1  pol gene [135]. In addition, a sample from each monthly 
blood draw will be archived. Ultimately these samples will be processed in a batched fashion 
and a second aliquot of HIV RNA from the patient sample will be screened for high and low 
abundance resistant variants (to ~1% levels) by [CONTACT_153535]-deep sequencing techniques [33, 38, 
136].

Potential alcohol/HAART interactions  resulting in hepatotoxicity will be evaluated with 
monthly liver function tests including AST, ALT and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT).

scores, represent validated surrogate fibrosis indices used to distinguish no or minimal liver 
fibrosis from advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.  Based on validation studies in a spectrum of 
cohorts with chronic HCV and HIV infection, scores of FIB-4>3.25 were used to designate 
advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Scores of FIB-4<1.45 were used to designate the absence of 
significant fibrosis.  Monthly blood work will also include creatinine and hemoglobin levels 
to incorporate into the VACs Index, a scoring system that assesses both HIV-related and -
unrelated morbidity/mortality. 
Sexual risk behaviors  will be measured using a modified assessment incorporating specific 
questions from the High Risk Behavior Survey (HRBS) [137], a validated instrument that 
measures sexual risk (non-condom use, multiple partners) behaviors that have been associated 
in previous studies with HIV serostatus and seroconversion.
Side effects/adverse experiences will be collected at each visit using the Systematic 
Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects (SAFTEE) [102], a validated measure of side 
effects in clinical trials. 
The alcohol and drug use disorders section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-
IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID-I/P) [138] will assess for past or present alcohol use disorders 
[139] at baseline.
Lifetime and current DSM-IV-TR Axis I and II psychiatric disorders will be assessed 
using
 the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) [138].
Blood Alcohol Concentration (breathalyzer) will be obtained at baseline and at each visit. 
We
 will use this data to monitor patients and identify those in whom self-report would be 
suspect (e.g. BAC > 0.4).
The Addiction Severity Index 5th Edition Lite (ASI-Lite) will be used to assess the severity 
of alcohol and any drug dependence and associated psychosocial impairment.  This instrument 
is a modified version of the ASI [140].
The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) is a multidimensional symptom inventory designed to 
reflect psychological symptom patterns of psychiatric and medical patients. 
The Short Inventory of Problems (SIP) is an assessment that measures physical, social, 
intrapersonal, impulsive, and interpersonal consequences of alcohol and drug consumption.

Urine toxicology testing will be performed at baseline to assess for THC, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],  cocaine, 
and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. We will conduct rapid urine toxicology testing for opi[INVESTIGATOR_908102].
SF-12: We will be collecting data  on health and well-being using the SF-12 form.
Substance Use Survey: We will collect data on ongoing or new substance use, including 
cigarette use,
 using the Substance Use Survey.
 
Patient Satisfaction: A  semi-structured interview, administered by a research assistant, will 
be used to assess overall satisfaction with the clinic setting, including specific components of 
treatment such as medication, nursing interactions, and physician visits.
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_908103]:  A number of recent studies have  identified specific genetic 
variants that predict responsiveness to naltrexone.  In particular, a single nucleotide 
polymorphism in exon 1 (Asn40Asp) in the mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_9811] (OPRM1) has been 
identified in numerous retrospective studies as highly correlated with clinical response (144-
146).  Subjects with one or two Asp40 alleles have a 74-87% response to naltrexone, as 
compared with a 49% response in those lacking this variant (146).  In order to control for this 
important variable, and to further explore the interaction of this polymorphism with clinical 
response, we will perform targeted gene testing to identify the presence of the Asp40 allelic 
variant.

4.   Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical  analyses that support the study design. 
Data monitoring
Our Web-based computer system,  TrialDB, for data collection is used by [CONTACT_908142]. 
TrialDB is a Web-accessible, multi-disciplinary database for study- or disease-specific clinical 
research data designed to store the focused data required for clinical trials and clinical 
research studies. TrialDB is "open-source" software developed  
at the Yale Center for Medical Informatics (YCMI) and is being used at Yale and outside Yale 
to support clinical trials and clinical research. TrialDB has a large number of advanced 
features for data management and monitoring, including standard web reports and exports to 
SAS, SPSS, and SQL.
The core of this system will consist of a database hosted on a network of secure servers 
that are
 capable of collecting and storing data using Web-based applications that are accessed 
by [CONTACT_908143]’s Internet 
Explorer. The system meets the highest security and reliability standards.  All connections to 
the systems are secured and encrypted using 128-bit strong encryption protocols and only 
authorized users are able to access the system.  The core of this system will consist of a SQL 
Server database and a Web server capable of collecting data and storing data using Web-based 
applications that are accessed by [CONTACT_908144]’s Internet Explorer. The system 
meets the highest security and reliability standards.  All connections to the systems are 
secured and encrypted using 128-bit strong encryption protocols and only authorized users are 
able to access the system. All data is stored and backed up on servers located in a secured 
environment. Electronic files of all study data can be transferred securely to designated and 
authorized persons at any point during or after the study. At the request of the Principal 
Investigator, the host will erase all data from its systems and backed up data. This approach 
complies with security requirements and is consistent with other current projects that are 
being conducted.
Statistical analyses  
General considerations: Statistical procedures
 and models for analyzing data have been 
selected according to the research hypotheses being investigated and  the types of data 
available. In general, p-values <0.05 will be considered  statistically significant. When 
necessary, however, we will use appropriate corrections of p-values to account for multiple 
statistical tests.  Statistical analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat sample using 
SAS Release 8.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and SPSS 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL) 
statistical packages. Where appropriate, hypotheses will be tested by [CONTACT_908145] 
(VIVITROL vs. placebo), time, and the interaction between group assignment and time.  Loss 
to follow-up is of concern in longitudinal analyses, particularly if loss to follow-up is 
differential. We plan to use established strategies (> 90% follow-up) to reduce loss to follow-
up [122, 124]. A benefit of the mixed effects models approach is that subjects who do not 
have complete information on the outcome variable can be included, provided that missing 
data is missing at random.
Specific Aim 1: To compare the efficacy of VIVITROL +MM/MC versus placebo 
+MM/MC on adherence to  HAART. 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/11/2018 VALID THROUGH 10/13/2019

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/11/2018 VALID THROUGH 10/13/2019Version 12/14/2012 Page 27 of 55Hypothesis 1: VIVITROL +MM/MC will lead to improved adherence to HAART when 
compared to placebo + MM/MC. 
HAART medication adherence, specifically focusing on the proportion of patients 
achieving 95% or greater HAART adherence (See justification for this threshold in Section 
B.7.), will be evaluated using pharmacy fill/refill data on a monthly basis and self-report. For 
each month of the 24-week treatment period, and the 9 and 12 month follow-up periods, we 
will calculate the number of days of HAART medication adherence.  Because HAART, the 
simultaneous use of ≥ [ADDRESS_1274665] of care for HIV-
infected individuals, patients will be classified as adherent when their regimen medication 
possession ratio (MPR) (calculated as the days’ supply of medication divided by [CONTACT_908146] [84]) is > 0.95, signifying greater than 95% 
adherence. We will also capture the MPR of all anti-retroviral medications. In prior work, we 
have shown that over a one year study period in VACS, the HAART MPR was 70% 
compared to 77% of any anti-retroviral total (Kim et al, unpublished). For patients who are on 
HAART but less than 95% adherent, we will determine what proportion of this group 
achieved greater than 95% adherence.   
For primary outcome analysis, both aggregate and stratified analyses will be carried out 
to compare the proportion of participants in each of the two groups who achieve ≥95% 
adherence during the last four months of observation. 
The probability of achieving the primary outcome will be modeled using logistic 
regression analysis. An unadjusted model (treatment) and models that include covariate 
adjustment (treatment plus other predictor variables eg depression, race, opi[INVESTIGATOR_908105], CD4 level, viral load level) will be executed.
In addition and, as appropriate, linear mixed effects models will be used to assess 
changes in adherence over the six months of observation. Models will include a fixed effect 
for treatment status, time as a continuous variable representing the month of observation, and 
the interaction between treatment and time in order to assess difference in slopes of change by 
[CONTACT_121395]. Random effects will be included to account for intra-subject correlation of 
repeated measures. Additional factors that may impact rate of change in adherence include 
time-varying covariates such as CD4 and viral load. Model fit will be assessed with analysis 
of residuals and other standard methods for assessing goodness-of-fit [136].
There are multiple strategies to measure adherence (See Sections B.8. and B.9.). Based 
on strong evidence in support of this strategy [72, 88, 89], we have chosen to examine the 
percentage of patients, using pharmacy fill-refill data, who achieve 95% or better adherence to 
their HAART treatment as our primary outcome measure of adherence [60, 117].  We will 
also examine adherence using self-report data collected using  AIDS Clinical Trials Group 
(ACTG) assessment. Patients will be classified as meeting the criteria for greater than 95% 
adherence if they are adherent 29-[ADDRESS_1274666] will be used to compare HAART medication 
adherence between the two treatment conditions based on self-report.
Specific Aim 2:  To compare the efficacy of VIVITROL +MM/MC versus placebo 
+MM/MC in reducing  days of heavy drinking. 
Hypothesis 2:  VIVITROL +MM/MC counseling will lead to greater reductions in the 
number of days of heavy drinking when compared to placebo + MM/MC.
We plan to use a standard alcohol consumption outcome, the number of days of heavy 
drinking
 (4 or more drinks per drinking occasion for women and 5 or more drinks per 
drinking occasion for men) in the past 30 days. This measurement was one of the outcomes

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/11/2018 VALID THROUGH 10/13/2019Version 12/14/2012 Page 28 of 55that differed between the control and VIVITROL group in the recent study of extended release 
VIVITROL [57]. The planned analyses for this outcome will include examining the number 
of days of heavy drinking over the 24-week treatment period and at the 9-month and 12-
month follow-up periods. This measure will be based on self-reported alcohol use from the 
Time-Line Follow Back. Since individuals may choose to leave during treatment and a small 
proportion could be lost to follow-up we plan to use repeated measures analysis of variance 
with the MIXED Models procedure. The MIXED Models procedure was designed for 
unbalanced repeated measures with missing data, allowing for intra-participant serial 
correlation and unequal variance and covariance structure across time [137].  A repeated 
measures analysis of variance in the Mixed Models procedure takes into consideration 
differences that may emerge over time, and we will use this procedure to test for a significant 
treatment effect, time effects, and the interaction of these two on the primary outcome 
measure. 
Specific Aim 3 (Exploratory): To explore the effect of VIVITROL +MM/MC versus 
placebo +MM/MC on biologic outcomes including:
3a) HIV  markers—viral mutations (using standard assays and ultra-deep sequencing), 
CD4 lymphocyte count and HIV RNA level; and 
3b) Liver function tests 
Specific Aim 3a:
To compare differences between the two treatment conditions in the impact on viral 
mutations, we will use descriptive statistics to report the prevalence of current HIV drug 
resistance mutation patterns at baseline and at 24-weeks, 9 and 12 months. HIV resistance 
mutations, as defined by [CONTACT_908147] [138], will be evaluated.  
We will evaluate the association between heavy drinking and HIV viral mutations first in a 
dichotomous way. We will evaluate the bivariate association of heaving drinking and viral 
mutations and conduct a chi-square evaluation that contrasts the development of HIV viral 
mutations (positive vs. negative) with heavy drinking (yes vs. no).  Subsequently we will 
conduct exploratory analyses using multinomial logistic regression to adjust for the potential 
effects of prior resistance mutations, antiretroviral medication class, duration of HIV disease, 
and duration of HAART. We will explore the effect of HAART adherence on the relationship 
between heavy drinking and the development of HIV drug resistance using sequential 
modeling to test for a potential mediating effect of HAART adherence. Finally, we will 
conduct an exploratory analysis to determine if the presence and quantity of minor variants 
affects virologic and HIV outcomes.
To compare differences between the treatment conditions, monthly CD4 lymphocyte 
counts and HIV RNA will be evaluated using the Mixed Models repeated-measures analysis 
controlling for baseline differences.  To compare differences between the treatment conditions 
on their impact on liver function tests and Fib-4, we will use the Mixed Models repeated-
measures analysis controlling for baseline differences.
We also plan to explore the effect of the treatment conditions on sexual risk behaviors (as 
measured by [CONTACT_908148] a monthly basis). A Mixed Models repeated-measures analysis will 
be used to evaluate treatment group, time, and interaction effects. We will also collect data on 
baseline hepatitis status, depressive symptoms at baseline and at the completion of the study, 
and any side effects reported by [CONTACT_433692].

Numerous studies have found NTX to be safe and rarely associated with toxicity or severe side 
effects.  These side effects appear to be dose-related and are less likely to occur at the dose 
proposed in this study.  The most frequently reported side effects are gastrointestinal in nature, 
including epi[INVESTIGATOR_50684], nausea and vomiting.  Other, less frequent side effects include 
nervousness, headaches, low energy, sweating, joint and muscle pain, blurred vision and 
insomnia. Hepatotoxicity 
can occur but typi[INVESTIGATOR_412144] (e.g., 200-300 mg 
daily) and resolves when NTX is discontinued. Additionally, case reports have reported 
elevated liver enzyme tests in patients who were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in 
combination with high-dose NTX. NTX has been shown to have an effect on the embryo in the 
rat and the rabbit when given in doses approximately 140 times the human therapeutic dose.

Before FDA approval, extended release naltrexone was studied in more than 900 patients [63]. 
Extended release naltrexone appears to be generally well tolerated, and adverse effects tend to 
be mild [61, 110]. Patients using extended release naltrexone do not develop tolerance for or 
dependence on the medication.
The extended release formula has been shown to be safe, tolerable, and efficacious in the 
treatment of alcohol use disorders [61]. In this large 6-month multi-site study in the treatment 
of alcohol dependence the most common adverse events (AEs) were nausea, headache, and 
fatigue. Other less common AEs included insomnia, vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, 
dizziness, injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. Nausea 
was mild or moderate in 95% of cases; however the large majority of these cases occurred 
only during the first month of treatment. The most common injection site reaction was 
tenderness. Seven patients (1%) discontinued injections due to site reactions. Study 
discontinuation secondary to AEs occurred in 29 (14.1%) of the 380mg naltrexone group, 
14(6.7%) of the 190mg group, and 14 (6.7%) in the placebo group. Group differences were 
accounted for by a greater number of AEs of nausea, injection site reaction, and headache. 
The percentage of patients who experienced serious AEs (SAEs) was similar among groups 
(5.4% for 380mg, 4.8% for 190mg, and 7.2% for placebo). The most common SAE was 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_908106]. Two SAEs (eosinophilic pneumonia and interstitial 
pneumonia) were judged as possibly related to study medications. Mean AST and ALT levels 
did not change significantly over the course of treatment or with medication. A recent large 
study of extended release NTX found that mean liver enzymes did not change significantly 
over the course of treatment and there was no effect of medication on the proportion of 
patients in the different groups who had liver enzyme elevations higher than 3 times the upper 
limit of normal [61]. In addition, it has been found to be safe for use in patients with mild to 
moderate liver impairment [109] with evidence of a 15% greater reduction in liver enzyme 
levels in the NTX group as compared with the placebo group [110]. 
    
In a 3-month study of 315 alcohol dependent patients [110]  who received monthly injections 
of NTX, there were no major differences between the NTX group and the placebo group in 
terms of serious adverse events, adverse events other than injection site reactions, or reactions 
at the injection site. Six subjects experienced serious adverse events. One subject in the NTX 
group experienced two such events (i.e., an orbital fracture and a human bite to the face). Five 
subjects in the placebo group experienced serious adverse events (three subjects were 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_908107], one of whom required detoxification and had suicidal 
depression; one subject required surgical repair of an ulnar fracture; and one subject was 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_908108], which resolved within 2 weeks). There was no 
overall group difference in the percentage of patients reporting one or more adverse events. 
The most common adverse events were headache, nausea, and fatigue. Three adverse events 
differed significantly by [CONTACT_1570]: upper abdominal pain was more common in the 
NTX group, and irritability and chest pain occurred more commonly among placebo subjects. 
Injection site adverse events occurred at an overall frequency of 5% and this rate differed 
significantly by [CONTACT_19313]. A significantly greater percentage of subjects in the NTX group 
reported one or more injection site reactions. The most common injection site reactions were 
pain, induration, and contusion, with a trend for pain to be more common in the NTX group.

Throughout the study both groups, the naltrexone and the placebo group, will receive 
psychosocial counseling focused on reducing their heavy drinking. This form of treatment, while 
not pharmacotherapy, has been shown to be effective therapy for heavy drinking and alcohol abuse 
and dependence.
d.   Describe the procedures that are in place to safeguard participants receiving placebo. 
All participants will be informed that there is a chance that they may receive placebo as 
part of this study. All participants will receive active therapy in the form of psychosocial 
counseling which will include Medical Management and Medication Coaching which focuses on 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_908110]. They will receive this combined counseling

6.Use of Controlled Substances:
Will this research project involve the use of controlled substances in human subjects?
 Yes   No See instructions to view controlled substance listings. 
If yes, is the use of the controlled substance considered:
 Therapeutic: The use of the controlled substance, within the context of the research, has the 
potential to benefit the research participant.
 Non Therapeutic: Note, the use of a controlled substance in a non therapeutic research study 
involving human subjects may require that the investigator obtain a Laboratory Research License. 
Examples include controlled substances used for basic imaging, observation or biochemical studies 
or other non-therapeutic purposes. See Instructions for further information.

Recruitment will occur  by [CONTACT_908150]-C screenings at the study sites in coordination with 
the clinical teams. In addition to recruiting through clinics (NSC, West Haven VA, and the Haelen 
Center), we will recruit at sites that provide services to HIV-infected patients, including AIDS 
Project New Haven, Hill Health Center, Fair Haven Community Health Center, Hispanos Unidos, 
and Liberty Housing.
Recruitment via Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS):
In addition to the recruitment methods listed above, a sampling approach termed respondent 
driven sampling (RDS) will
 be employed. One of the goals of this approach is to gain more 
access to subjects that would not ordinarily present for routine medical care. In using RDS, we 
will attempt to engage our current study participants as active recruiters by [CONTACT_908151]. Each study participant will be offered the opportunity to participate in recruitment 
of other subjects. If they choose not to participate, this in no way will affect their treatment in the 
study. Those subjects who agree to participate in RDS will each be given 5 coupons,  
 for each enrollee they recruit. To create waves of chain referral, 
participants are given these coupons to give to other out-of-treatment HIV positive patients with 
heavy drinking or alcohol abuse/dependence they seek to refer to the study.  To protect the 
confidentiality of all respondents, each participant is assigned a series of unique coupon 
identification codes, and these codes will be placed on the coupons. These codes will be stored in 
a secure central database.

toxicity or severe side effects.  These side effects appear to be dose-related and are less likely to 
occur at the dose proposed in this study.  The most frequently reported side effects are 
gastrointestinal in nature, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_50684], nausea and vomiting.  Other, less frequent 
side effects include nervousness, headaches, low energy, sweating, joint and muscle pain, blurred 
vision and insomnia. Hepatotoxicity
 can occur but typi[INVESTIGATOR_412144] (e.g., 200-
300 mg daily) and resolves when NTX is discontinued. Additionally, case reports have reported 
elevated liver enzyme tests in patients who were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in 
combination with high-dose NTX. NTX has been shown to have an effect on the embryo in the 
rat and the rabbit when given in doses approximately [ADDRESS_1274670] for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
Before FDA approval, extended release naltrexone was studied in more than 900 patients [63]. 
Extended release naltrexone appears to be generally well tolerated, and adverse effects tend to 
be mild [61, 110]. Patients using extended release naltrexone do not develop tolerance for or 
dependence on the medication.
The extended release formula has been shown to be safe, tolerable, and efficacious in the 
treatment of alcohol use disorders [61]. In this large 6-month multi-site study in the treatment 
of alcohol dependence the most common adverse events (AEs) were nausea, headache, and 
fatigue. Other less common AEs included insomnia, vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, 
dizziness, injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. Nausea 
was mild or moderate in 95% of cases; however the large majority of these cases occurred 
only during the first month of treatment. The most common injection site reaction was 
tenderness. Seven patients (1%) discontinued injections due to site reactions. Study 
discontinuation secondary to AEs occurred in 29 (14.1%) of the 380mg naltrexone group, 14 
(6.7%) of the 190mg group, and 14 (6.7%) in the placebo group. Group differences were 
accounted for by a greater number of AEs of nausea, injection site reaction, and headache. 
The percentage of patients who experienced serious AEs (SAEs) was similar among groups

In a 3-month study of 315 alcohol dependent patients [110]  who received monthly injections 
of NTX, there were no major differences between the NTX group and the placebo group in

overall group difference in the percentage of patients reporting one or more adverse events. 
The most common adverse events were headache, nausea, and fatigue. Three adverse events 
differed significantly by [CONTACT_1570]: upper abdominal pain was more common in the 
NTX group, and irritability and chest pain occurred more commonly among placebo subjects. 
Injection site adverse events occurred at an overall frequency of 5% and this rate differed

reported one or more injection site reactions. The most common injection site reactions were 
pain, induration, and contusion, with a trend for pain to be more common in the NTX group. 
While there is an inherent risk of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_908111], VIVITROL does not itself increase the risk of 
alcohol withdrawals.  Alcohol withdrawal syndromes are not listed as known adverse 
reactions to this medication, nor is there any physiologic mechanism by [CONTACT_908155][INVESTIGATOR_224456], insofar as VIVITROL has no direct alcohol antagonistic 
effects.  Moreover, the current proposal emphasizes cutting back  on drinking, rather than 
abstinence, which further attenuates any theoretical risk of alcohol withdrawal.  Thus, while 
each subject is followed closely by a physician or nurse practitioner throughout the course of 
the study, no additional monitoring for alcohol withdrawal is indicated.  Nonetheless, patients 
will be cautioned regarding the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndromes, and 
will be provided relevant emergency contact [CONTACT_908156]. Should they experience symptoms of alcohol withdrawal patients 
will be instructed to seek emergency medical care without delay and to contact [CONTACT_908157].
While the concern for NTX’s hepatotoxicity appropriately warrants monitoring of liver 
function,
 theoretically and based on the minimal existing literature on interactions between 
NTX and HAART, these interactions should be clinically insignificant. Many of the 
medications used for the treatment of HIV are metabolized via the cytochrome P-450 system

To examine antiretroviral and hepatic safety in HIV-infected patients receiving naltrexone 
we conducted an analysis of the NIAAA-funded VACS Virtual Cohort. All patients were 
receiving antitretroviral medications.  The median duration of naltrexone treatment for the 
cohort was 90 days.  We compared CD4 cell count, HIV viral load (VL), AST and ALT 
during the period in which patients had received a prescription for naltrexone.  We compared 
baseline and follow-up laboratory results using descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon signed-

Chawarski MC, Mazlan M. Maintenance treatment with buprenorphine and naltrexone for 
heroin dependence in Malaysia: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Lancet. 
2008;371(9631):2192-200).  All were infected with Hepatitis C.  No patients experienced 
adverse events that required changing the dose or discontinuing the medication. One patient 
experienced an isolated elevation in their ALT level.
Summary: Naltrexone treatment is associated with no significant adverse alterations in CD4, 
viral load, AST and ALT in HIV-infected patients who are receiving antiretroviral 
medication.  The stability of these biological markers during naltrexone treatment supports 
safety when provided along with antiretroviral medications.
Interaction of NTX and alcohol:  NTX has been shown to reduce the number of drinks 
consumed in the laboratory and in the clinic.  No safety concerns have been identified in these 
studies when alcohol is consumed in combination with NTX. There is no evidence that 
individuals attempt to over-ride the effects of NTX by [CONTACT_412196].  NTX does not block 
the aversive effects of alcohol consumption which serve to limit drinking.
Counseling:  There are no significant adverse effects of participating in the counseling 
intervention (MM/MC) portion of this study provided by [CONTACT_908158] a 
Clinical Psychologist. Participation is likely to be of benefit. 
Breath screening, blood/urine collections: Breath screening and blood and urine collections are 
performed primarily as safeguards and should add no risks other than those normally associated 
with these procedures.

all non-invasive, and should also add no risks to subjects, as our past experience indicates.  
Audiotaped sessions:  Participants will be made aware during the informed consent process that 
sessions with the study physician or nurse will be audiotaped and that the nature of these sessions 
will involve participants speaking about information regarding their health status, alcohol use, 
HIV status, medical history, and participation in the study.  However, participant names will 
never be recorded on the tapes and the tapes will be coded by [CONTACT_908159].  Participants will be given the option to 
decline to be taped during the study.
2.Minimizing  Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized. 
Naltrexone (VIVITROL): Prospective participants with medical conditions that would 
contraindicate the use of VIVITROL will be screened out.  We will exclude individuals with 
evidence of significant hepatocellular injury (AST, ALT > 5 times the upper limit of normal or a 
diagnosis of cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class greater than A or B). The dose of VIVITROL used is 
low and so the risk of hepatotoxicity is low.  However, we will monitor liver enzyme tests prior 
to, during, and at end of treatment and a subject whose AST or ALT rises to > [ADDRESS_1274672] is on active VIVITROL.  
Rating scales and questionnaires  The major risk of the assessments is the potential loss of 
confidentiality which is discussed in the section related to confidentiality below.  To  minimize 
any discomfort associated with reporting on sensitive behaviors, participants will be informed 
that they may refuse to answer questions that they are not comfortable answering. Questions 
related to eligibility determination and monitoring of safety and treatment response are not 
optional.  If a person declines to answer these questions, we will advise them that they will not 
be able to participate and we will make a referral to other treatment if they are interested.

generated by [CONTACT_15365]. Individually identifiable health information will be protected in 
accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. All 
research personnel will be trained on Institutional Review Board (IRB) and HIPAA procedures. 
In Case of Injury: If a participant is injured as a direct result of participation in this study, 
treatment will be provided.  The participant and/or his or her insurance carrier will be 
expected to pay the costs of this treatment. No additional financial compensation for injury or 
lost wages is available.  Participants will not waive their legal rights by [CONTACT_232642].
All participants will be asked to carry a medication card that will, in case of emergency, alert 
the treating medical personnel that they are taking VIVITROL. Participants will be asked to 
carry this card at all times. The card will include appropriate drug information and 
precautions.  If immediate information is needed about the study, participants will be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_908162].
During the follow-up period, any patient requiring additional intervention due to significantly 
increased alcohol consumption or serious psychiatric/medical symptoms will receive a referral 
to treatment. 
3. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DSMP) based on the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the 
final determination of the risk to subjects.) For more information, see the Instructions, page 24.
a. What  is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects 
participating in this study?  Moderate
b. If  children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk 
level for the children participating in this study? NA
c. Data  and Safety Monitoring Plan: 
The risks associated with participating in this study can be categorized as moderate (i.e., risks 
are recognized as being greater than everyday risks but not high, and there is adequate 
surveillance and protections to discover adverse events promptly and keep their effects 
minimal).  Because of the risks associated with this medication, we have included in the 
protocol procedures to exclude participants who would be at the greatest risk (e.g. 
concomitant significant medical conditions or liver dysfunction) and to monitor potential 
adverse effects and transfer patients to alternative treatment if medical problems possibly 
related to either of the study medications develop.  The medical transfer procedure along with 
the procedures for detecting and responding to adverse events are sufficient to ensure prompt 
discovery of any adverse events and to minimize their effects.  Consistent with the Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) template of the Yale University School of Medicine, the 
DSMP includes provisions for data review and performance of safety reviews, as described 
below.

reporting possible adverse reactions.  
All adverse events meeting the criteria for expedited reporting are reported to the Yale 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) using Form 6A for reporting adverse events.  The Principal 
Investigator (PI) reviews all adverse events, classifies the attribution of adverse events (e.g., 
definitely, probably, possibly related; unlikely or unrelated) and grades the severity of the 
event, on a 6-point scale (0=no adverse event or within normal limit; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 
3=severe; 4=life-threatening; 5=fatal).  Serious unanticipated or anticipated adverse events 
will be reported immediately to NIAAA.  The summary will include the number of subjects 
enrolled and a summary of graded adverse events to date, using the chart format included in 
the Yale University DSMP template. All serious adverse events will be reported to the local 
IRB according to local IRB requirements and to the NIAAA project officer within [ADDRESS_1274674] Officer summarizing all

Definition of Adverse Event Terms
Adverse Event – Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or 
procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure 
(attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). [NIH Guidelines, January 
2001]
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that 
results in any of the following outcomes: 
1. death,  
2. a  life-threatening adverse drug experience, 
3. in  patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
4. any persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
5. or  a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_908114] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
[21CFR312.32(a)]
Life-threatening Adverse Drug Experience – Any adverse drug experience that places the 
patient or subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction 
as it occurred, i.e. it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death. [21CFR312.32(a)]
Unexpected Adverse Drug Experience  – Any adverse drug experience, the specificity or 
severity of which is not consistent with the current investigator brochure; or, if an investigator

the risk information described in the general investigational plan.  “Unexpected” as used in this 
definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed (e.g., 
included in the investigator brochure) rather than from the perspective of such experience not 
being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical 
product.[21CFR312.32(a)]
Attribution
Assessment of attribution is made by [CONTACT_827578], 
during, and after occurrence of the event, including diagnostic tests to assess the cause of the 
event.  Clinically relevant data include, but are not limited to; underlying disease, past and 
present medical history (all concurrent non-malignant disease), concurrent medications, and 
timing between event and drug administration.  The mechanism of action and prior toxicology of 
the study drug should be considered.
An adverse event is associated with the use of the drug when there is a reasonable possibility 
that the experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641]. [21CFR312.32(a)]
Attribution Standards
        Unrelated:  The Adverse Event is clearly not related to the investigational agent (s)
        Unlikely :      The Adverse Event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s)
        Possible:      The Adverse Event may be related to the investigational agent(s)
        Probable:    The Adverse Event is likely related to the investigational agent(s)

During the follow-up period, any patient requiring additional intervention due to significantly 
increased alcohol consumption or serious psychiatric/medical symptoms will receive a referral 
to treatment. In addition, any and all adverse events during the follow-up period will be 
reported to the IRB and the Project Officer at NIAAA with serious adverse events being 
reported within [ADDRESS_1274675] (DSMB) with experts in 
antiretroviral medications and addiction pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The DSMB will review the 
progress of the study, and also conduct an interim analysis. The DSMB will monitor the 
occurrence and frequency of serious adverse events on a quarterly basis and review the results 
of the interim analysis. The interim analysis will be conducted six months after [ADDRESS_1274676]. The interim analysis will 
evaluate whether the proportion of subjects achieving >95% adherence differs significantly (at 
p<.05) by [CONTACT_120247]. This interim analysis will determine whether one of the 
interventions is significantly inferior to the other on the primary outcome of improving 
HAART adherence.

         SECTION  X: R ESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1.     Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research?
Individuals who are
 not eligible to participate  or decline to participate may still receive 
treatment and other services to which they are otherwise entitled. Other medication options 
that have been approved for the treatment of alcohol problems by [CONTACT_33438] (FDA) are acamprosate (Campral), and disulfiram (Antabuse)  As with 
VIVITROL and with any other medication, acamprosate, disulfiram, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 
(currently not FDA-approved for treatment of alcohol problems) have side effects about 
which patients should be informed by [CONTACT_161009]. Other non-medication treatments 
include psychotherapy and referral to Alcoholics Anonymous or other support groups.  All 
three medications and forms of psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy and 
motivational interviewing have been found to be efficacious in the treatment of alcohol 
problems.  
2. Payments for  Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be 
made to subjects and the conditions for receiving this compensation. 
Participants will receive a  gift card for completing monthly assessments (6) and a 
 gift card for the baseline assessments and 9-month and 12-month assessments.  The total 
possible compensation for the study per patient is  for completion of all assessments, 
including bloodwork. 
3. Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs 
associated with
 participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that 
will be provided at no cost to subjects.     
There are no costs to the subjects to participate in this research. At no cost to them, they 
will receive
 a medical evaluation including ongoing monitoring of their HIV markers, potentially 
receive medication to treat their heavy drinking, and will receive comprehensive psychosocial 
counseling addressing their drinking.
4. In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk.
a.     Will medical treatment be
 available if research-related injury occurs? 
b.     Where and
 from whom may treatment be  obtained? 
c.     Are there any  limits to the treatment being provided? 
d.     Who will pay for this treatment? 
e.     How
 will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]? 
If a participant is
 injured as a direct result of participation in this study, treatment will be 
provided.  The participant and/or his or her
 insurance carrier will be expected to pay the costs 
of this treatment. No additional financial compensation for injury or lost wages is available.  
Participants will not waive their legal rights by [CONTACT_4907].
All participants will be asked to carry  a medication card that will, in case of emergency, alert 
the treating medical personnel that they may be taking VIVITROL. Participants will be asked

A.Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
This
 study aims to perform  a two-stage randomized controlled trial  to test the effectiveness of 
behavioral weight loss (BWL) and pharmacotherapy (Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]; NB), alone and in 
combination, for the treatment of binge eating disorder (BED) in patients with obesity. 
Figure 1. Research design of two-stage trial of BWL and NB for BED in patients with obesity
The first stage will examine the effectiveness of  NB medication with and without BWL in 
reducing both binge eating and weight (See Figure 1). 
(1)Stage [ADDRESS_245126] – Primary Aim - Test effectiveness of BWL and NB medication, alone and 
combined, for BED. Primary aims are to evaluate the effectiveness for (a) reducing binge 
eating and (b) reducing weight.
(2)Stage [ADDRESS_245127] – Secondary Aims: (a) Examine effectiveness of BWL and NB medication, 
alone and combined, on secondary outcomes: remission (zero binges/ 28 days), eating-
disorder pathology, depression;
 and (b) Explore predictors, moderators, and mediators of 
primary outcomes.
The second stage will examine whether  continued NB medication  results in superior 
maintenance and longer-term outcomes than placebo amongst responders to Stage 1 
treatments. The second stage  will also explore whether adding cognitive-behavioral therapy 
(CBT) enhances on-going pharmacotherapy (NB/placebo), amongst non-responders to Stage 1 
treatments (See Figure 1).

responders to Stage 1 treatments for enhancing maintenance and longer-term (a) change in 
binge eating frequency and (b) weight change.
(4)Stage [ADDRESS_245129] – Exploratory Aims:  (a) Explore  the effectiveness of NB medication on 
secondary outcomes: relapse to BED threshold, eating pathology, depression, psychosocial 
and metabolic functioning; and (b) Explore whether Stage 1 treatment moderates 
medication effects during Stage 2.
(5)Stage [ADDRESS_245130] – Exploratory Aim: CBT for Non-Responders: Explore, amongst  Non-
responders to Stage 1 treatments, whether adding CBT enhances on-going NB 
pharmacotherapy.
B.Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. 
Provide references to support the expectation
 of obtaining useful scientific data.
Obesity (OB) is a refractory, serious public health problem, and an estimated 34% of 
U.S. adults have obesity (Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, & Curtin, 2010). This study proposes 
to test treatments for a high-risk subgroup of adults with OB, adults with binge-eating 
disorder (BED) and OB (Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007). 
Binge-Eating Disorder (BED) – A Clinical Subgroup of People with Obesity
BED is a formal diagnosis in the DSM-5  (American Psychiatric  Association, 2013). BED 
is defined by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_205536] (eating an unusually large amount of 
while experiencing a subjective sense of loss of control) without compensatory weight 
control methods (e.g., self-induced vomiting) that characterize bulimia nervosa. The 
BED diagnosis requires binge eating to be associated with marked distress. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_205537] (Hudson et al., 2007; Kessler et al., 2013). The prevalence of BED in the 
National Co-morbidity Survey Replication (Hudson et al., 2007) was 3.5% among 
women and 2.0% among men. Estimates of BED are higher in adults with obesity (8%) 
and much higher in most clinical settings (Johnson, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], & Williams, 2001; Wilfley, 
Wilson, & Agras, 2003). Compared to other eating disorders, BED is prevalent across 
gender and ethnic/racial groups (Marques et al., 2011). BED has diagnostic validity 
(Striegel-Moore & Franko, 2008), is a stable construct (Pope et al., 2006), differs from 
other eating disorders and obesity (Allison, Grilo, Masheb, & Stunkard, 2005; Grilo et 
al., 2009; Grilo, Masheb, & White, 2010) and is strongly associated with obesity 
(Kessler et al., 2013) and elevated risk for medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial 
problems (Grilo et al., 2009; Grilo et al., 2010; Hudson et al., 2007; Hudson et al., 
2010). 
Treatment for BED: Current Status and Future Needs 
Overall, several medications have short-term efficacy relative to placebo (Reas & Grilo, 
2008) and certain psychological treatments have efficacy (Wilson, Grilo, & Vitousek, 
2007) with important advantages over medication (alone or in combination) (Reas & 
Grilo, 2008). 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)  is the best-established  treatment for BED 
(National Institutes of Clinical Excellence, 2004; Wilson et al., 2007). RCTs testing CBT 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page 10 of 55report roughly 50% remission rates  from binge eating (Grilo, Masheb, & Wilson, 2005; 
Grilo, Masheb, Wilson, Gueorguieva, & White, 2011). Improvements in binge eating are 
significantly superior to fluoxetine (Grilo, Masheb, & Wilson, 2005) and fluvoxamine 
(Ricca et al., 2001) and are durable for 12-months after CBT (Grilo, Crosby, Wilson, & 
Masheb, 2012). RCTs have provided further support for “specific” efficacy of CBT for 
BED, although CBT fails to produce weight loss (Grilo et al., 2011). The association 
between BED and obesity (Hudson et al., 2007) and possible heightened risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_136276] (Hudson et al., 2010) highlight the need to find 
methods to reduce weight–and binge eating–in this subgroup of people with obesity.  
Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL)  for  BED may be more effective than CBT for 
producing weight loss while achieving comparable reductions in binge eating that are 
maintained through 12-month follow-ups (Grilo et al., 2011). Although longer-term 
follow-up suggests that improvements in binge eating and weight losses are less 
durable in BWL (Wilson, Wilfley, Agras, & Bryson, 2010), BWL is more widely available 
and has greater dissemination than “specialist” CBT methods, which are very limited in 
availability (Hart, Granillo, Jorm, & Paxton, 2011; Kazdin & Blase, 2011; Shafran et al., 
2009; Wilson & Zandberg, 2012). BWL has the advantage of being available in many 
health service settings and delivered by [CONTACT_205603]-care workers (i.e., not just 
“specialists” and doctoral-level clinicians with CBT training). This is especially relevant 
for BED because few individuals with BED receive mental health services (Marques et 
al., 2011) and especially fewer receive specialist treatment (Wilson & Zandberg, 2012). 
Pharmacotherapy for BED has received research attention, albeit nearly all RCTs 
have been of short duration and without follow-up period to establish durability (Reas & 
Grilo, 2008, 2014, 2015). Critical review and meta-analysis show that several drugs – 
working through varied mechanisms – have short-term efficacy relative to placebo for 
reducing binge eating and produce weight loss ranging from modest to none (Reas & 
Grilo, 2008). Placebo-controlled trials of anticonvulsants topi[INVESTIGATOR_136329] 
(Claudino et al., 2007; McElroy et al., 2003; McElroy et al., 2006) have reported effects 
for reducing both binge-eating and weight (average weight loss of roughly 3-4 kg 
compared to placebo), but have also shown high dropout and frequent adverse events 
that become near-universal and troubling with longer use (McElroy, Kotwal, Hudson, 
Nelson, & Keck, 2004). SSRI antidepressants, initially regarded as a potential treatment 
strategy (e.g., National Institutes of Clinical Excellence, 2004) are characterized by 
[CONTACT_136355] (Reas & Grilo, 2008), produce no weight loss at all 
(Grilo, Masheb, & Wilson, 2005) and are inferior to CBT (Grilo, Masheb, & Wilson, 2005; 
Ricca et al., 2001). 
Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) for BED. An important development was the 
FDA approval in January [ADDRESS_245131] demonstrated that 50mg and 70mg were 
superior to placebo (McElroy et al., 2016; McElroy et al., 2015) for reducing binge-
eating days and reported binge-eating abstinence rates of LDX versus placebo (Study 
1: 40% versus 14%; Study 2: 36% versus 13%) at the end of the 11-week treatments. 
Importantly, no longer-term follow-up are presently available. 
We are not using LDX for several reasons. The binge remission outcomes for LDX 
at 11-weeks 
(McElroy et al., 2016) are less robust than those reliably produced by [CONTACT_205604] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page [ADDRESS_245132]-treatment (Grilo, 
Masheb, &
 Crosby, 2012). Most importantly, although LDX was associated with weight 
loss (mean 4.9 kg) (McElroy et al., 2015), weight loss was examined as a safety 
measure, not a clinical outcome. The FDA approval and manufacturer product labeling 
included a Limitation of Use highlighting that LDX is not indicated or recommended for 
weight loss. This is because other CNS-stimulant sympathomimetic medications for 
weight loss have been associated with severe cardiovascular problems and the safety 
and efficacy of LDX for obesity have not been demonstrated. 
Pharmacotherapy for Obesity . Sibutramine, which was effective for reducing both 
binge eating and weight in BED (Appolinario et al., 2003; Wilfley et al., 2008), was 
withdrawn from the market in 2010 due to cardiovascular concerns. This left orlistat as 
the sole FDA-approved anti-obesity medication for longer-term use (Vetter, 
Faulconbridge, Webb, & Wadden, 2010), until 2012. Placebo-controlled trials of orlistat 
for BED (Golay et al., 2005; Grilo, Masheb, & Salant, 2005) reported significant yet very 
modest effects for weight loss, but not for reducing binge eating when added to BWL or 
CBT. A recent RCT testing orlistat combined with BWL reported a moderator effect of 
significantly greater weight loss for orlistat than placebo for obesity without BED, but not 
for obesity with BED (Grilo & White, 2013). 
The 2012 FDA approval of two new anti-obesity medications (phentermine/ 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_205538])
 (Colman et al., 2012; Miller, 2013) came after heated debate 
given significant concerns about limited efficacy and safety profiles, and questions 
about serious medical complications with longer use (Colman et al., 2012; Miller, 2013). 
The low rates of achieving 5% weight loss (less than 30% in all three of the phase III 
RCTs) was inflated due to the use of completer analyses despi[INVESTIGATOR_205539]-out rates (e.g., 45% in the BLOOM Trial) (Smith et al., 2010). The combination 
phentermine/topi[INVESTIGATOR_205540], but this needs to be 
considered against the unfavorable adverse event and tolerability profile.
NB Pharmacotherapy 
In September 2014, the FDA approved the combination of naltrexone and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_205541] (but not BED). The putative mechanisms of action are described in Section 
VI (page 30).
Obesity Outcomes. Several  large RCTs have reported that NB was effective in 
promoting significant, clinically-meaningful weight loss in patients with obesity 
(Greenway et al., 2010; Greenway, Whitehouse, et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2013). NB 
showed greater weight loss than placebo, -6.5 vs -1.2% (Greenway et al., 2010); -8.2% 
vs -2.1% (Smith et al., 2013), and the following percentages achieving 5% weight loss: 
56% vs. 18% (Smith et al., 2013), 52% vs. 15% (Greenway et al., 2010). Apovian et al. 
(2013), in a study of 1496 patients with obesity, reported greater weight losses relative 
to placebo (-6.5% vs -1.9% at week 28 and -6.4% vs -1.2% at week 56) and greater

Assessment
Pre-Screening: Participants 
responding to  recruitment efforts (see page 36) will be 
screened by [CONTACT_756]. If participants prefer to answer some of the screening questions 
through the Yale Qualtrics system, participants will indicate their consent to the 
recruitment/screening process in the online system. Potentially eligible participants will 
be consented and evaluated in-person by [CONTACT_205605]. Participants will 
complete survey measures of eating behaviors and psychopathology and psychosocial 
functioning around the time of the in-person appointment.
Participants who provide informed consent and are determined to be eligible (see page 
21) will then participate in the study as depi[INVESTIGATOR_205542]. See also Figure 1 (page 8).
Baseline Assessment: As part of the determination of eligibility (for full criteria, see 
page 21), participants will complete two interviews, the MINI International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview-Version
 7.0 (MINI) and Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) 
to generate psychiatric diagnoses and detailed current eating disorder features and 
diagnoses. Other measures, for safety and establishment of baseline values, will also 
be obtained: BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, eating behaviors and psychopathology, 
psychosocial functioning, metabolic measures, and perception of treatment measures. 
For a full description of instruments, see “Measures,” which includes a grid depi[INVESTIGATOR_205543] (page 15). The
 baseline assessment will occur 
over two in-person meetings and is estimated to be take a total of 2-3 hours in-person. 
Study Intervention: This study will be a two-stage randomized placebo-controlled trial 
with patients who have both BED and obesity.  Throughout the study, participants and all 
study staff, including investigators and outcome assessors, will be blind to the 
pharmacotherapy treatment condition, and outcome assessors will also be blind to the 
behavioral treatment condition. Stage [ADDRESS_245136] the effectiveness of NB

responders). Stage 2 will also explore whether adding CBT enhances on-going NB 
pharmacotherapy (amongst non-responders). See Figure 1 on page 8.
Randomization to Stage 1 Treatment:  Eligible participants (determined at the end of 
the baseline assessment according to inclusion/exclusion criteria as described on page 
21) who agree to participate and provide written informed consent will be randomized to 
one of the four treatments. N=160 patients with obesity and BED will be randomly 
assigned in balanced factorial (2 X 2) design, to one of four 16-week methods: 
BWL+NB, BWL+Placebo, NB, or Placebo. 
We will use blocked randomization with random block sizes of 4 and 8 for Stage 1 to 
obviate any secular trends.
 We will monitor the randomization procedure and determine 
whether systematic differences in demographic characteristics (age, gender, race/ 
ethnicity) or clinical characteristics (BMI, binge-eating frequency, psychiatric co-
morbidity) become evident. We will consider adjustment to randomization if indicated 
(Kraemer & Fendt, 1990; Kraemer & Pruyn, 1990). 
Stage 1 Treatment Protocols:
Treatment Protocol for Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]  (NB) Pharmacotherapy: Medication 
will be prescribed per FDA-approved guidelines for obesity and as used in previous 
RCTs demonstrating effectiveness of NB medication for weight loss in patients with 
obesity (Greenway et al., 2010; Greenway, Whitehouse, et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2013; 
Wadden et al., 2011). NB medication will combine naltrexone sustained-release (SR, 32 
mg/day) combined with bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_60098] (360 mg/day) taken daily (8 mg naltrexone/90 mg 
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_205544] – two tablets taken twice daily; matching tablets and frequency 
for placebo). 
Following regimens in previous RCTs,  a dose escalation approach will be used, 
beginning with a quarter of the full dose and increasing weekly until the full dose is 
achieved at week 4 (Greenway et al., 2010; Wadden et al., 2011).  This dose will 
continue for the remainder of the trial. If a patient develops intolerable side effects, the 
study physician may reduce the dose to achieve tolerability. If the patient cannot 
tolerate the medication, has adverse effects, or is non-compliant with medication for >7 
consecutive days, s/he will be discontinued from the medication arm. 
Participants will meet with  the study physician at the start of treatment. The brief 
visit (10 minutes) will focus on compliance and evaluating side effects. Participants will 
meet monthly with study staff throughout Stage 1 treatment.
Treatment Protocol for Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL): The BWL treatment is a 
mixture of the published LEARN behavioral lifestyle weight control treatment developed 
by [CONTACT_205606] (2000) and the Diabetes Prevention Program (Knowler et al., 2002); the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_205545]. BWL will be delivered weekly by [CONTACT_79161]-clinicians according to treatment 
manuals that detail session-by-session procedures. These manuals closely parallel 
patient-version BWL self-care materials for the entire course of treatment and follow 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020

NB/placebo medication
 for obesity. BWL will instruct patients in developi[INVESTIGATOR_205546] a balanced deficit diet comprised of roughly 20% protein, 30% max of fat, 
and 50% carbohydrate, with general goals of 1500kcal/day. Behavioral strategies (goal-
setting, self-monitoring, stimulus control problem-solving) will be taught within a lifestyle 
approach for achieving dietary goals (augmented by [CONTACT_205608]) and 
physical activity goals (to achieve 180 min/week of moderate physical activity). 
Research-clinicians will be trained in BWL by [CONTACT_205609].
Stage [ADDRESS_245137] Assessment: After completing  Stage 1 treatment (BWL+NB, 
BWL+Placebo, NB, or Placebo), participants  will complete an assessment, the EDE, to 
assess for binge-eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_17771]. Based on this interview, participants will be 
classified as “responders” (65% or greater reduction in binge-eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], per 
findings suggesting prognostic significance of such responses) (Grilo, Masheb, & 
Wilson, 2006; Grilo, White, Wilson, Gueorguieva, & Masheb, 2012) or “non-responders.” 
Other measures are described in the “Measures” grid that depi[INVESTIGATOR_205547] (page 15). 
Randomization to Stage 2 Treatments:
“Responders” to acute treatments (65% or greater reduction in binge eating) 
will be randomized to NB or placebo for [ADDRESS_245138] treatment as a stratifying variable. 
“Non-responders” will continue Stage 1 pharmacotherapy  (NB/placebo) and 
50% will be randomized to receive CBT (weekly for 8 weeks and biweekly for 8 weeks) 
in addition to continued pharmacotherapy. Participants and researchers will remain 
blind to pharmacotherapy condition. 
 “Non-responders” to Stage [ADDRESS_245139]-treatment assessment when they finish CBT treatment, and 
then will begin the follow-up stage. 
The study biostatistician ([CONTACT_205630]) will create randomization lists and 
communicate directly
 with the research pharmacist.
Stage 2 Treatment Protocols:
Treatment Protocol for Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]  (NB) Pharmacotherapy: Medication 
prescription and dosage will be the same as described in the NB Treatment protocol for 
Stage 1. Participants will meet with the study physician for a brief visit at the start of 
Stage 2, and will meet with study staff monthly throughout Stage 2 treatment.
“Responder” participants randomly assigned to discontinue medication will 
receive a one-week down-titration followed by [CONTACT_14296]. Participants randomly assigned 
to continue active medication will receive the same active dose throughout Stage 2. 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page 15 of 55Participants randomly assigned to begin NB medication in Stage 2 will receive a three-
week dose escalation as previously described. The double-blind will be maintained by 
[CONTACT_205610]. 
“Non-responder” participants will continue their Stage 1 NB/placebo 
pharmacotherapy without interruption.
After 12-month follow-up assessments are completed, patients will be informed 
(separately from investigators by [CONTACT_44499]) whether they were on NB or 
placebo. Medication double-blind will be maintained for investigators and outcome 
assessors until all participants have completed final 12-month follow-up assessments. 
Treatment Protocol for CBT: In  Stage 2 treatment, “non-responders” to Stage 1 
treatments will be randomly assigned to receive CBT or not. CBT will be delivered by 
[CONTACT_79161]-clinicians based on CBT treatment manuals (Fairburn, Marcus, & Wilson, 
1993) used in our previous RCTs (Grilo, Masheb, & Salant, 2005; Grilo et al., 2011) and 
similar to those used in leading CBT RCTs (Wilfley et al., 2002). CBT manuals provide 
detailed session-by-session procedures for the clinicians and patients. CBT is a 
“specialist” focal treatment with three overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_126837]. (1) Establishing a 
collaborative therapeutic relationship while focusing on educating patients about the 
nature of binge eating and factors thought to maintain the problem. Specific behavioral 
strategies (e.g., self-monitoring) are used to help patients identify problematic eating 
behaviors while establishing a normal structured eating pattern. (2) Integrating cognitive 
restructuring procedures, focusing on helpi[INVESTIGATOR_205548]/shape and thoughts that trigger 
binge eating. (3) Maintaining change and preventing relapse.
Stage [ADDRESS_245140] Assessment and Follow-up Assessments: After completing Stage  2 
treatment (NB, Placebo, CBT+NB, or CBT+Placebo), participants will complete one 
interview, the EDE. Other measures are described in the “Measures” grid that depi[INVESTIGATOR_205549] (page 15).

Clinical Interviews: 
MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Version 7.0 (MINI) (Sheehan et al., 
1998) is a brief structured interview for Axis I psychiatric disorders. Validation 
and reliability studies
 have supported the MINI, including good convergence with 
SCID (Sheehan et al., 1998). The MINI requires much less time than the SCID 
and reduces participant burden while providing adequate psychiatric data to 
characterize patients and determine exclusion criteria. 
Eating Disorder Examination Interview–16th Edition ( EDE) (Fairburn & Cooper, 
1993) is an investigator-based interview assesses the features of eating 
disorders and generates 
eating disorder diagnoses. The EDE will be our primary 
method for assessing binge eating and eating disorder psychopathology. The 
EDE focuses on the previous 28 days, except for diagnostic items, which are 
rated for additional duration stipulations to address DSM-5 criteria for BED. The 
EDE assesses the frequency of different forms of overeating, including objective 
binge-eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (OBE; i.e., unusually large amounts of food with loss of 
control). The EDE also comprises four scales (dietary restraint, eating concerns, 
weight concern, and shape concern) and a global severity score. The EDE has 
good psychometric properties (Grilo, Masheb, & Wilson, 2001b), is the major 
outcome measure for BED RCTs (Wilfley et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2010), and 
has good test-retest reliability.
We will also gather clinical data on the patient’s medical history prior to the study, 
which we will update 
as indicated in Figure 1. If patients begin other treatments, 
this will allow us to account for this in analyses.
Assessment Training:  Independent outcomes assessors will receive training in 
diagnostic interviews from investigators following well-established protocols used in 
previous projects. Once interviewers are certified in the measures (MINI and EDE), they 
will receive ongoing supervision to ensure consistent use and prevent drift. 
Self-Report Questionnaires:
Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire Version (EDE-Q). The self-report 
EDE-Q (Fairburn & Beglin, 1994) generates the same overeating data and scale 
scores as the EDE interview. EDE-Q has good test-retest reliability with BED 
patients (Grilo, Masheb, & Wilson, 2001a; Grilo et al., 2001b; Reas, Grilo, & 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page 17 of 55Masheb, 2006). The  EDE-Q converges well with the EDE as a measure of 
“change” (Sysko, Walsh, & Fairburn, 2005). 
Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin) (Godin & Shephard, 1985) 
assesses frequency of mild, moderate, and vigorous physical activity. The Godin 
has good test-retest reliability (Godin & Shephard, 1985) and has good support 
from validation studies using various activity measurements such as activity 
monitors and maximum oxygen consumption (Miller, Freedson, & Kline, 1994).
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). The BDI (Beck & Steer, 1987) is a widely 
used measure of the  symptoms of depression. A voluminous literature has 
documented good internal consistency (studies range .73 to .95), short-term test-
retest reliability, and convergent validity (Beck, Steer, & Carbin, 1988). 
Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) (Stunkard & Messick, 1985) 
measures eating behaviors with  3 factors: cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and 
hunger. TFEQ has empi[INVESTIGATOR_205552] (Foster et al., 1998), and shows differential 
response across treatments consistent with putative mechanisms (Grilo & 
Masheb, 2005; Safer, Agras, Lowe, & Bryson, 2004). 
Food Craving Inventory (FCI-II )  (White, Whisenhunt, Williamson, Greenway, & 
Netemeyer, 2002) assesses general and specific food cravings and comprises 
four subscales for different food groups. The FCI has been validated and 
psychometrically supported in studies with obesity and with obesity/BED groups 
(White & Grilo, 2005; White et al., 2002). 
Power of Food Scale (PFS) (Lowe et al., 2009) assesses the psychological 
impact of and the drive to consume palatable foods in an obesogenic 
environment.
 The PFS measures appetite for–rather than the consumption of–
palatable foods. The PFS has been validated in large normative (Lowe et al., 
2009) and obese samples including weight-loss treatment-seeking obese 
patients (Cappelleri et al., 2009). The PFS comprises 3 scales reflecting food 
proximity (food available, food present, and food tasted) supported by [CONTACT_205611]-retest reliability and internal consistency (range 0.81-0.91) 
(Cappelleri et al., 2009). The PFS is a good measure of the hedonic impact of 
food environment cues; fMRI studies have reported associations with state 
cravings for desired foods and shifts in brain networks (Rejeski et al., 2012). 
Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) (Gearhardt, Corbin, & Brownell, 2009) is a 
measure of addictive eating behaviors with high fat/sugar foods. Items 
correspond to the substance dependence diagnostic criteria. The YFAS has 
demonstrated adequate internal reliability, convergent validity, and incremental 
validity in predicting binge eating.
Eating Loss of Control Scale (ELOCS ) (Blomquist et  al., 2014) assesses the 
complexity of loss of control eating  over the past four weeks. The ELOCS has 
demonstrated good convergent validity and is considered a valid self-report 
questionnaire that may provide important clinical information regarding 
experiences of LOC in obese persons with BED.
Paffenbarger Physical Activity  Questionnaire  (PPAQ) (Paffenbarger, Hyde, Wing, 
& Hsieh, 1986) measures specific physical activity (complementing the Godin) 
and has been used extensively in epi[INVESTIGATOR_904] 
(Paffenbarger, Hyde, Jung, & 
Wing, 1984; Paffenbarger, Wing, & Hyde, 1978) and obesity treatment studies. 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page 18 of 55PPAQ has good psychometrics (Albanes, Conway, Taylor, Moe, & Judd, 1990) 
and correlates significantly
 with expensive and burdensome fitness measures 
(Siconolfi, Lasater, Snow, & Carleton, 1985).
Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12 ) (Ware & 
Sherbourne, 1992) is widely-used measure of health related quality of life. This 
measure has well-established reliability and validity (McHorney, Ware, Lu, & 
Sherbourne, 1994; McHorney, Ware, & Raczek, 1993) for physical health and 
mental health domains. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_33548] (PSQI ) (Buysse,  Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & 
Kupfer, 1989) is a widely used measure of quality and patterns of sleep, 
assessing namely subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual 
sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime 
dysfunction over the last month. The PSQI has demonstrated good internal 
consistency and reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .83). 
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-2 ) (Bohn, Babor, & Kranzler, 
1995) is a measure that assesses alcohol use. The AUDIT has been used 
extensively and demonstrates
 high internal consistency and good test-retest 
reliability (Reinert & Allen, 2007). 
UPPS-P Impulsivity Scale (UPPS ) (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001) measures 
impulsivity in five domains: negative  urgency (acting rashly in response to 
negative emotions), positive urgency (acting rashly in response to positive 
emotions), lack of premeditation (acting without taking into account 
consequences), lack of perseverance (difficult remaining focused on difficult or 
boring tasks), and sensation-seeking (favoring stimulating or exciting activities) 
(Cyders, Littlefield, Coffey, & Karyadi, 2014).
Physical Assessment:
Lipid profiles (Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]): total cholesterol, HDL-, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides will 
be obtained fasting per established protocols (Anderson et al., 1995). 
Glycemic Control (GC): HbA1c, Glucose and Mean Plasma Glucose, routine 
measures of average glucose control for a previous (3-month) period. 
Hepatic function panel (Liver Function) will be assessed for safety. 
Thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH) will be assessed if patients report any history 
of thyroid disease or are taking thyroid medications. 
Urine drug testing for opi[INVESTIGATOR_205553]. 
Pregnancy testing will be assessed for female patients of child-bearing potential.
Body Mass Index ( BMI) will be calculated using measured Height (measured 
once at baseline) and Weight  (obtained regularly at assessment meetings).
Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR). BP readings (both systolic and 
diastolic) and HR will be obtained regularly at assessment meetings.
Perceptions of Treatment:
Treatment Credibility 
and Satisfaction. Credibility and Satisfaction  ratings will 
allow patients to provide feedback on the treatment and treatment delivery.

Adverse Events will be assessed using an adverse event checklist of most 
commonly reported adverse events for  NB. Research-clinicians will ask open-
ended and follow-up questions as needed. 
Placebo Ratings. Patients and clinicians will record whether they believe the 
patient is on active medication or placebo. 
Maintenance of 
Cohort. Research staff will form on-going relationships and maintain 
contact [CONTACT_20688]. Our experience indicates this improves likelihood of 
participants’ willingness to perform follow-up assessments. In addition: (1) At pre-
screening and baseline assessment, participants will be asked whether they will be 
available for the entire study duration; (2) Participants will be excluded if unable to 
comply with birth control methods; (3) Participants will provide names and contact 
[CONTACT_205612]; (4) At each assessment, participants will be asked 
if they have plans to move; and (5) We will reimburse participants for completion of the 
assessments.

H. How will eligibility be determined, and by [CONTACT_20898]? 
Diagnostic Assessment. Participants
 will be interviewed by [CONTACT_205614]-level research-clinicians (MINI and EDE) to determine whether they meet 
criteria for binge-eating disorder. These diagnostic clinical interviews will also 
determine whether participants have any co-existing psychiatric conditions (including 
substance use disorders) that require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136293]/different 
treatment.
Physical Assessment. The  study physician will determine medical eligibility based 
on results of participants’ physical examination (within one year of starting the 
study), and/or
 approval of participant’s primary care provider, as well as results of 
the baseline assessment. Information obtained from the physical examination will

I.Risks: Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, 
discomforts, or
 inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research. 
NB Pharmacotherapy. 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page 22 of 55Since participants will undergo  a thorough physical evaluation and screening for 
known contraindications for treatment with the NB medication, potential risks will be 
minimized. In clinical trials, NB was associated with the following side effects in 10% 
or more of the time and significantly greater than rate in placebo: nausea, headache, 
constipation, and vomiting. NB was associated with the following side effects less 
than 10% of cases but significantly more than placebo: dizziness, insomnia, dry 
mouth, and diarrhea. Large studies (e.g., Greenway et al., 2010 with N=1742) 
reported that the proportion of participants reporting a serious adverse event did not 
differ between NB and placebo (1.6% versus 1.4%) and that none of the observed 
events were judged to be related to the study. It appears important to evaluate and 
monitor blood pressure and heart rate because studies have found that patients with 
obesity treated with NB have significantly lower drops than placebo in systolic BP 
changes (-0.4 vs. -2.1), diastolic BP (-0.1 vs -1.0), pulse rate (1.0 vs -0.1) (Greenway 
et al., 2010). 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_205556]. 
The main risk associated with placebo is failure to improve, although some persons 
do improve solely on placebo. Although
 the placebo is inactive, some persons who 
take the placebo report that they experience some of the side-effects listed above. 
Participants will have a 50% chance (by [CONTACT_205615]) of receiving placebo instead of NB 
during Stage 1. Since participants have a 50% chance of receiving BWL at the first 
stage of treatment, there is a 25% chance (by [CONTACT_205615]) overall of receiving only 
placebo. Since participants have a 50% of receiving CBT in the second stage (if they 
are non-responders), the chances of receiving only placebo drop to roughly 12.5%. 
Additionally, “non-responders” to Stage [ADDRESS_245142] obesity treatment. CBT is an 
established “specialist”
 treatment for BED (considered the leading treatment by 
[CONTACT_205616]). Neither BWL nor CBT have any meaningful risks. With 
BWL, the only foreseeable risks include some mild discomfort or embarrassment 
when discussing eating patterns and weight. Some mild hunger may be experienced 
initially when attempting to follow the modest caloric guidelines. Some mild fatigue 
may be experienced initially when attempting to increase modest lifestyle physical 
activity. With CBT, the only foreseeable risks include some mild discomfort or 
embarrassment when discussing binge eating, body image, and associated thoughts 
and feelings. Previous controlled clinical trials with similar interventions with large 
numbers of similar patients have not reported problems. Any troublesome effects 
would be readily identifiable by [CONTACT_205617]. 
Research assessments are all noninvasive, and should add no substantial risk. The 
major disadvantages are the time taken to complete them and possible breach of

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page [ADDRESS_245143] experience with  these measures indicates that they are 
acceptable to participants. Careful efforts aimed at maintaining confidentiality will be 
made. All identifiable information will be stored in a locked research cabinet. All 
participants will be assigned a study participant number. Subsequently, participants 
will be identified only by [CONTACT_205618] (e.g., 
John Smith = JSMI). A list of numbers and the corresponding names will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_205557] a locked research cabinet. Any 
identifying information that is collected will be kept in a locked research cabinet in a 
locked unit. Any information published as a result of the study will be such that it will 
not permit identification of any participant. All information collected will remain 
confidential except when we are legally required to disclose such information by [CONTACT_2371]. 
These circumstances include knowledge of abuse of a child or elderly person, 
threats of harm to self or others, and plans to harm to property. Data will be stored in

accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. All 
research personnel will be trained on IRB, ethics, and HIPAA procedures.
There is the possibility that drawing blood might cause a small bruise, mild 
discomfort, or infection.
Failure 
to Improve. There is a chance  that the patient's binge eating or obesity may 
fail to improve or may worsen during the study.
J.Minimizing Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be 
minimized.
Effective 
screening will exclude all prospective participants who would be at greater 
risk for complications because of medical or psychiatric illnesses. Participants will be 
evaluated repeatedly throughout the study and will be monitored for any adverse 
reactions. Given the uncertain effects of medication during pregnancy, the following 
precautions will be taken for women of reproductive age: 1) a female participant of 
reproductive age will be asked to have a pregnancy test, 2) a female participant of 
reproductive age must agree to use a reliable method of birth control while she is in 
the study and to alert the research team if she departs from her birth control plans or 
if, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_136305], she thinks she might be pregnant; we will do 
a pregnancy test as needed during the treatment phase of the study,, and 2) if a 
woman becomes pregnant after study entry, her medication will be discontinued. 
Wallet Safety Card. Each participant will be given a wallet card with the code 
number for the medication assignment in the event of an emergency and the need

emergency numbers in case of adverse events or other concerns.
Warning about Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5390]: We will include this advisory pertaining to opi[INVESTIGATOR_205558]-based medications and drugs in the written consent 
form, verbal
 consent process, and on the wallet card: Naltrexone can cause 
withdrawal symptoms in individuals who are taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_136292]. 
You should not participate and we will not include you in the study if we know or 
suspect you are using opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573]-containing drugs. 
Urine drug screen for opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]: Participants will be asked to have a urine drug screen 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]. Participants with a true positive  test for opi[INVESTIGATOR_205559], per 
exclusion criteria. 
Monitoring of Depressive Symptoms . To monitor changes in depressive symptoms, 
patients will be asked to complete the BDI-II  at monthly clinic visits. Research 
clinicians will review BDIs during the clinic visit, and if indicated, will asked pointed 
questions pertaining to suicidality. If the research clinician judges that the participant 
is experiencing significant adverse effects of the medication, the investigators and 
study physician will be consulted to determine whether to discontinue the 
medication. The participant will be compensated in full, and will be asked to continue 
to attend clinic visits and to continue to participate (if applicable) in the BWL/CBT 
treatment to ensure remission of any distressing symptoms. If warranted, the 
participant will be given a referral. In addition, the following advisory will be included 
in the verbal consent process, and written on the consent form: The U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Advisory cautioning health care providers, 
patients, and families to closely watch individuals taking naltrexone/bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_205560], especially during the first several weeks that the medication is 
being taken. Patients and their families should watch for and promptly report new 
symptoms. For example, report to the study doctor as soon as possible any signs of 
impulsivity (taking action or saying something without thinking first), agitation (feeling 
nervous or finding sitting still very difficult), and panic attacks (extreme fear without 
apparent reason).
Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured  during all evaluation visits. Two 
readings will be taken at each assessment. In the  event of high systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or heart rate, the study physician will be notified 
and will determine whether additional intervention and/or medication discontinuation 
is warranted. 
Liver function will be measured during baseline and month-1 clinic visits of Stage 1 
and Stage 2. The study physician will review results. Participants with hepatic 
disease will be excluded if this is detected at baseline, per exclusion criteria. The

additional intervention and/or medication discontinuation.
Medication Titration. Participants will have a three-week  dose escalation as 
previously described: one tablet daily (Naltrexone 8mg/ Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] 90mg; 1 week), 
two tablets daily (Naltrexone 16mg/ Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] 180mg; 1 week), three tablets daily 
(Naltrexone 24mg/ Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] 270mg; 1 week), followed by [CONTACT_205619]. 
If participants drop out of the study during either treatment phase, we will ask that 
they return any unused medication. Participants who have been on the study 
medication for more than 4 weeks, including those who complete the treatment, will 
be asked to taper off the study medication: two tablets daily (Naltrexone 16mg/ 
Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] 180mg; 4 days), then one tablet daily (Naltrexone 8mg/ Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] 90mg; 
3 days), to discontinue medications. Participants on placebo will take the same 
number of tablets as the active group to maintain the blind. Participants will be 
cautioned against stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_205561]. Taper off is not medically 
necessary for participants on the study medication for 4 weeks or less.

The risks associated with the current study are deemed greater than minimal for 
the following reasons: 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page 26 of 551. We do not view the risks associated with the NB combination medication as 
minimal risks.
2. Given
 the now established safety and validity of the current NB combination 
medication in RCTs and FDA
 approval, we do not view the proposed studies as 
high risk.
The potential exists for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or 
otherwise, to occur since it is not possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in 
any given individual or in advance of first-hand experience with the proposed study 
methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the 
proposed study as follows:
Adverse events will be monitored for  each subject participating in the study and 
attributed to the study procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_205563]:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational 
procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational 
procedures(s)/agent(s).
The following scale will be used in grading the  severity of adverse events noted during 
the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate 
adverse event
3. Severe
 
Serious Adverse Events:
In 
addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_205564]

considered serious if it results in any of the following outcomes:
1. Death;
2. A life-threatening experience requiring in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205565]; 
3. A persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
4. A 
congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR
5. Any 
other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the 
participant’s health and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.

L.Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical  analyses that support the study design. 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for the randomized groups will be 
compared using chi-square tests for categorical variables, and ANOVA or Kruskal-
Wallis tests for continuous variables. Continuous variables will be examined for 
adherence to normal distribution using normal probability plots and Kolmogorov-
Smirnov tests. If normality is not satisfied and transformations do not help with 
achieving normality, alternative analytic strategies will be considered such as 
generalized estimating equations or nonparametric methods. Dropouts and completers 
will also be compared. Analyses will be intent-to-treat. Primary outcomes will be tested 
at the two-sided 0.05 significance level. Secondary analyses will be adjusted for multiple 
tests using Bonferroni correction.
Overall analysis strategy:  Mixed-effects models  (Diggle, Heagerty, Liang, & Zeger, 
2002) will be used to compare treatments. These  models allow for different numbers of 
observations per participant, use all available data on each participant, and are 
unaffected by [CONTACT_136383]. A further advantage is the capacity to test and 
account for individual-difference contributions to the treatment outcomes (Cudeck, 
1996; Cudeck & Klebe, 2002; Hedeker et al., 1996; Hedeker & Gibbons, 1996; Singer, 
1998). They provide flexibility in modeling the correlation structure of the data. In 
models for each outcome, we will include fixed effects of time, BWL, NB and all possible 
interactions, and random participant-level effects. Because we cannot a priori predict 
the shape of the response over time in each arm of the trial we will first treat time as a 
categorical predictor and will then test for polynomial trends over time. We will consider 
different error structures (e.g., AR1, independence) and select the best fitting one based 
on information criteria. We will compare dropout patterns between groups and if there 
are concerns of informative dropout or informative intermittent missing data, we will use 
pattern mixture models (Hedeker & Gibbons, 1997) to perform sensitivity analyses.
Stage [ADDRESS_245148] – Primary Aim #1: Test effectiveness of BWL and NB medication, alone 
and in combination, for
 BED. The primary aims are to evaluate the effectiveness for (a) 
reducing binge eating and (b) reducing weight. In the mixed models, the dependent 
variables will be (a) reduction in binge eating frequency, and (b) Percent weight loss. In 
view of the factorial design we will also be able to assess whether there are interactive 
or additive effects of the two treatments. We do not have a priori hypothesis regarding 
the interaction but will test it together with the main effects.
Stage [ADDRESS_245149] – Secondary Aims:  (a) Explore effectiveness of BWL and NB 
medication, alone and in combination, on secondary outcomes: remission (zero binges 
past 28 days), eating-disorder pathology (EDE global), and depression (BDI). To 
compare remission rates across groups we will use logistic regression with BWL, NB 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page [ADDRESS_245150] the interaction of the two 
treatments. Continuous
 secondary outcomes (EDE global and BDI) will be analyzed 
using the same approach as for primary aim 1. (b) Explore predictors, moderators, and 
mediators of primary outcomes (binge eating and weight loss). We will follow Kraemer’s 
(2002) conceptual/statistical models for exploring predictors, moderators and mediators 
for both binge eating and % weight loss outcomes. Per Kraemer (2002), we will explore 
if baseline characteristics predict/moderate treatment effects by [CONTACT_205620]. In terms of mediators, 
we will explore whether differential symptom changes during treatment are associated 
with subsequent longer-term primary outcomes. Repeated assessments of eating 
behaviors (EDEQ and TFEQ scales) and physical activity (Godin, PPAQ) constructs 
relevant to BWL, food-reward constructs (FCI, PFS) relevant to putative mechanisms of 
action for NB, and depression (BDI) a conceptual/empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-supported construct, will 
yield relevant change variables for analyses of mediation (i.e. testing subsequent 
changes in binge eating and weight).
Stage [ADDRESS_245151] – Primary Aim # 2: Among responders  to Stage 1 treatments, to evaluate 
the effectiveness for (a) binge eating and (b) weight. Our main hypothesis is that NB will 
have main effects on reduced binge eating and weight regains. In the mixed models for 
testing these hypotheses, the dependent variables will be (a) change in binge eating 
frequency and (b) percent weight change. 
Stage [ADDRESS_245152] – Secondary Aims:  (a) Among responders,  explore effectiveness of NB 
medication vs. placebo on secondary outcomes: relapse to BED threshold (binge once 
weekly), eating-disorder pathology (EDE global), depression (BDI), social/medical 
functioning (SF-36), and metabolic function (Lipid, Hb1Ac). Relapse rates across groups 
will be compared with logistic regression with medication as a fixed effect. Continuous 
secondary outcomes (EDE global and BDI) will be analyzed using the same approach 
as for primary aim 1. (b) Explore whether Stage [ADDRESS_245153] – Exploratory Aim: Among Non-responders to Stage 1, we will explore 
whether adding CBT enhances on-going pharmacotherapy (NB/placebo). We will 
compare CBT plus continued pharmacotherapy vs pharmacotherapy-only for reducing 
binge eating.
Power analysis: The sample size was based on the following power calculations.
Stage [ADDRESS_245154] – Primary Aim #1: Reported effect sizes for naltrexone/bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_205568] (% weight loss) are large (d=0.76 in Apovian et al (2013), 
d=0.[ADDRESS_245155] et al. (2013), and d=1.1 in Smith et al. (2013). However, because 
of the possibility of positive publication bias and since medium effect sizes (d=0.5) or 
larger are also considered clinically meaningful, we conservatively power our study to 
detect medium effect sizes. With 40 participants in each cell of the design table, we will 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page [ADDRESS_245156] 80% power to detect such effect sizes (d=0.5, f=0.25) for the medication 
main effects at
 2-sided significance level of 0.05 even after accounting for 20% dropout. 
With the sample sizes per group we are also well powered (power > 80%) to detect 
clinically meaningful effect sizes (f=0.25) for the interaction test between BWL and NB 
on percent weight loss even after assuming 20% dropout. Dropout rate is based on 
completion rates for our earlier RCTs with BED (87% in Grilo & Masheb, 2005; 84% in 
Grilo, White et al., 2014). 
Stage [ADDRESS_245157] – Secondary Aims: Remission rates for BWL for BED from our previous 
RCTs were 50% (Grilo
 & White, 2013) and 74%; Wilson, Wilfley et al. (2010) reported 
55% remission rate for BWL for BED. Thus, we conservatively calculate power based 
on estimated 50% remission rate for BWL alone. Remission rates for no-BWL/placebo 
are estimated at 10-15% (based on McElroy (2015) placebo rates in 2 large RCTs of 
14% and 13%). We estimated remission rate for NB medication at 45% (synergistic 
action of NB medication expected to produce higher rate than the 42% rate for 
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]-only (White & Grilo, 2013) and expect higher remission rate for the 
combination BWL/NB of 60%-70%. This results in the following projected effect sizes for 
the main effects of BWL (55% vs 28%, 60% vs 30%) and NB (53% vs 30%, 58% vs 
33%). With sample size of [ADDRESS_245158] more than 80% power to detect 
such differences assuming 2-tailed tests, alpha=0.05, with 20% dropout. 
Stage [ADDRESS_245159]: Based on our previous RCTs, we anticipate 70% of participants on 
BWL+NB and 65% on BWL
 or on NB will be responders. This yields a sample size of 88 
participants (28 on BWL+NB, 26 on BWL, 26 on NB, and 8 on placebo) for 
randomization to Stage 2 NB or placebo. Thus, if we base power calculation for phase 2 
on 44 participants per group and account for 20% dropout, we have at least 80% power 
to detect a medium to large effect size (d=0.68) for the difference between NB vs 
placebo at 2-tailed alpha of 0.05. For relapse, we can detect the following clinically 
meaningful differences in proportions (15% vs 45%, 30% vs 63%, 45% vs 77%) at 2-
tailed alpha of 0.05.
Stage [ADDRESS_245160] – Exploratory Aim: With N=72  non-responders (N=36 assigned to 
continuing medication (NB/placebo) and N=36 assigned to CBT plus continuing 
medication (NB/placebo), we would have 80% power to detect d=0.75 (remission rates 
of 5% vs 32%, 15% vs 49%, 30% vs 66%) at 2-tailed alpha level of 0.05 assuming up to 
20% dropout.

NB Pharmacotherapy. An FDA-approved  anti-obesity pharmacotherapy 
approach involves the combination  of naltrexone  and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_205571] (non-BED). 
Mechanisms of Action. The putative mechanisms of action for NB seem 
relevant for binge eating in addition to weight loss. Naltrexone, an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2635], is approved to treat alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561] (O'Malley et al., 
2007). Naltrexone produces weight loss in lab animals but only minimal weight 
losses in people (Billes & Greenway, 2011; Malcolm et al., 1985). Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_205572], noradrenergic, and nicotinic acetyl-cholinergic 
mechanisms (Han, Hwang, & Renshaw, 2010; Slemmer, Martin, & Damaj, 2000; 
Stahl et al., 2004). Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_205573], consistent with its FDA indication for treating nicotine dependence and 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page 33 of 55reduced weight gain during smoking  cessation (Farley, Hajek, Lycett, & Aveyard, 
2012; Hurt et al., 1997). Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_205574] (Li et al., 2005): in a meta-
analysis of five trials of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], the mean difference in weight loss was 2.77 kg 
(CI, 1.1 to 4.5) between bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136324] 6 months. White and Grilo 
(2013) reported preliminary, modest support for weight loss specifically in patients 
with obesity and BED.
NB Combination. The putative mechanisms of action for NB is especially relevant 
for reducing binge eating and weight per hypothesized effects on brain regions 
implicated in the regulation of food intake and weight based on research on the 
mechanisms of action of leptin (Billes & Greenway, 2011). The anorectic effects of 
leptin result from its excitatory effects on pro-opi[INVESTIGATOR_136284] (POMC) neurons in 
the hypothalamus melancortin system (Cowley et al., 2001; Marsh et al., 1999). 
Stimulated POMC signaling decreases food intake, increases energy expenditure, 
but is then inhibited by [CONTACT_136356] (Cowley et al., 2001). Thus, combining 
these two drugs will stimulate POMC neurons (bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]) plus block endogenous 
feedback that inhibits POMC activity (naltrexone) (Billes & Greenway, 2011; 
Greenway, Whitehouse, et al., 2009). This synergistic model received support both 
in vitro and in vivo studies (Cone et al., 2001; Greenway, Whitehouse, et al., 2009).
Obesity Outcomes. Recently, several  large RCTs have reported that the 
combination of these two medications (Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]) were effective in 
promoting weight loss in obese patients (Greenway et al., 2010; Greenway, 
Whitehouse, et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2013; Wadden et al., 2011). These RCTs 
reported significant clinically-meaningful weight losses with sustained-release 
naltrexone (32 mg/day) plus sustained-release bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (360 mg/day) combined in 
fixed-dose tablets. Most recently, Apovian et al. (2013), in a study of 1496 obese 
patients reported significantly greater weight losses relative to placebo (-6.5% vs -
1.9% at week 28 and -6.4% vs -1.2% at week 56) and significantly greater likelihood 
of achieving 5% weight loss (56% vs 18% at 28 weeks and 51% vs 17% at 56 
weeks). These findings supporting NB medication are quite consistent with earlier 
(large) RCTs which reported the following percentage of patients achieving at least 
5% weight loss: 56% vs. 18% (Smith et al., 2013); 52% vs. 15% (Greenway, 
Dunayevich, et al., 2009). Thus, the proposed RCT study will test the effectiveness 
of Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136325]-eating and producing 
weight loss in obese patients with BED.
Risks. Several large-scale studies  have found that this medication is safe and 
effective for the treatment of obesity (Greenway et al., 2010; Greenway, 
Whitehouse, et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2013; Wadden et al., 2011). The NB 
combination approved by [CONTACT_1622] (Contrave) is reported to have the following 
common adverse reactions: nausea (32.5%), constipation (19.2%), headache 
(17.6%), vomiting (10.7%), dizziness (9.9%), insomnia (9.2%), dry mouth (8.1%), 
and diarrhea (7.1%). In addition, Contrave will have the FDA warnings and 
precautions: “Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor for depression or suicidal

5. Use of Placebo:  Not applicable to this research project
If use of a placebo is planned, provide a
 justification which addresses the  following:
a. Describe the safety and efficacy of other available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. If there are no other 
available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], state this.
Expert 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] (Wilson et al., 2007) and critical quantitative meta-analytic reviews 
(National Institutes of Clinical Excellence, 2004) conclude CBT is the best-
established treatment for BED; CBT, however, does not produce clinically 
meaningful weight loss and is not readily available given the need for specialized 
training. Alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_205576] (which also fails to produce weight loss and is not 
readily available since it requires intensive training and few practitioners employ it) 
and self-help versions of CBT (which will be used in this study). Alternative 
pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_136328] (SSRIs) although 
weight loss is uncertain with those agents.  
Pharmacotherapy (medications) for BED has received increased research 
attention albeit nearly all RCTs have been of short duration and without follow-up 
period to establish durability (Reas & Grilo, 2008, 2014). Critical review and meta-
analysis show that several drugs – working through varied mechanisms – have 
short-term efficacy relative to placebo for reducing binge-eating and produce weight 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page [ADDRESS_245162] to none (Reas & Grilo, 2008). Placebo-controlled trials of 
anticonvulsants topi[INVESTIGATOR_136329] (Claudino et al., 2007; McElroy et al., 
2003; McElroy et al., 2006) have reported effects for reducing both binge-eating and 
weight (with a mean improvement in weight loss of approximately 3-4 kg compared 
to placebo), but have also shown frequent dropout and adverse events which 
become nearly universal with longer use (McElroy et al., 2004). SSRI 
antidepressants, previously regarded as a potential treatment strategy (National 
Institutes of Clinical Excellence, 2004) are characterized by [CONTACT_205624] (Reas & Grilo, 2008) and produce no weight loss at all (Grilo, 
Masheb, & Salant, 2005) and are inferior to CBT (Grilo, Masheb, & Wilson, 2005; 
Ricca et al., 2001). There are currently no FDA-approved medications for BED.
b. State the maximum total length of time a participant may receive placebo while on the 
study. 
Participants may receive placebo 
medication for  up to [ADDRESS_245163] rarely reported worsening and generally report a positive placebo 
response (Reas & Grilo, 2014).
d. Describe the procedures that are in place to safeguard participants receiving placebo. 
Possible
 risks include failure of binge eating and associated eating disorder 
features to improve. Previous experience suggests that the frequency of these 
situations is rare (Reas & Grilo, 2014). 
To safeguard participants, we plan to  assess potential adverse events, side 
effects, and clinical status. All participants will have monthly visits with research 
clinicians, who can be expected to detect the clinical changes that warrant concern. 
Participants will be removed from the study if, through the consultation of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_205577], it is determined that participant safety is at risk, including worsening 
depression, suicidal ideation, intensification of binge eating, or failure to comply with 
medication. If a participant is removed from the study, a research clinician will 
provide referrals. If removal is indicated, a referral for appropriate care will be 
provided. 
6.Use of Controlled Substances:

Examples include controlled substances used for basic imaging, observation or biochemical 
studies or other non-therapeutic purposes. See Instructions for further information.
7.Continuation of Drug Therapy After Study Closure   Not applicable to this project
Are subjects provided the opportunity to continue to receive the study drug(s) after  the study has 
ended?
  Yes  If yes, describe the conditions under which continued access to study drug(s) may apply 
as well as conditions for termination of such access. 
  No  If no, explain why this is acceptable.

cabinets within a locked suite. Interviews will be recorded using a digital recorder 
and recordings will be securely and separately stored and be identified only by a 
study number and date. 
Any information published as a result  of the study will be such that it will not 
permit identification of any participant. All information collected will remain 
confidential except when we are legally required to disclose such information by 
[CONTACT_2371]. These circumstances include knowledge of abuse of a child or elderly 
person, threats of harm to self or others, and plans to harm to property. 
Information about positive urine drug screens, should they occur, will be recorded 
using the participant study number. Results from drug screens that are 
conducted alongside bloodwork and therefore have identifiable data will be 
retained for the duration of the study and maintained on secure Yale servers (for 
electronic data) or in locked research cabinets within a locked suite. We will 
destroy positive urine drug test results that occur alongside identifiable 
information as soon as the participants is determined to be ineligible.

de-identified data) 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_205581]. Research records may be 
the subject of
 an audit by a regulatory agency within the federal government. 
Organizations which have a responsibility for protecting human participants, 
including the Yale Human Investigation Committee (HIC), may have access to 
the research records. The participant’s identity will remain protected except as

need to be reported. 
No, this is unlikely.
SECTION IX: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/28/2020Page 45 of 55Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from  the 
research, either to the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a 
benefit in this context of the risk benefit assessment.) 
Participation in the study  has the potential to result in decreased frequency of binge 
eating and weight loss for at least some patients through free assessments and 
treatment. More generally, the low risk is offset by [CONTACT_205628], which would be beneficial to many persons 
who experience these conditions.
     SECTION X: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1.Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the 
research?
Alternatives 
include community referrals for cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral 
weight loss, or medications. 
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any  payments that will 
be made to subjects, the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving 
this compensation.

Participants will be reimbursed when they complete the assessments at baseline

and 12-Month Follow-up ($100). At baseline, conditions for receiving compensation 
include attending the appointment. At subsequent assessments, conditions for 
receiving compensation include completion of surveys, bloodwork, and interview. 
*A minority of patients (estimated to be 5% of all participants) will have the option to 
receive CBT after Stage 2 before completing
 follow-up assessments (See page 
Randomization to Stage 2 Treatments:
14). These patients will be asked to complete an additional assessment (prior to the 
follow-up stage)
 and will therefore receive an additional $100 at the time of that 
assessment. Conditions for receiving compensation include completion of interview, 
surveys, and bloodwork.

associated with participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study 
that will be provided at no cost to subjects.     
Psychological
 assessment, labwork, and treatment will be provided at no cost to 
participants, their insurance, health plan benefits nor other third party payer. 
Participants will be asked to provide information from a recent (within one year) 
physical with their primary healthcare provider. If they have not had a physical within 
the past year, we will ask them to obtain a physical prior to participating in the study. 
A physical exam with their own primary healthcare provider would be at the 
participant’s (or the participant’s insurance) cost. (Note: In research we have 
conducted in the past with patients diagnosed with binge eating disorder, the 
majority of patients had a physical within the past year.) 
4.In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal 
risk.
a. Will medical treatment be available if research-related injury occurs? 
Yes.
 Referrals
 for treatment will be made.
b. Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? 
If the participant
 is injured as a direct result  of participation in this research study, the 
medical staff at the Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205582], short-term hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or short-term outpatient care. 
c. Are there any limits to the treatment being provided? 
If the participant
 is injured as a direct result  of participation in this research study, the 
treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_136395](s). 
d. Who will pay for this treatment? 
The participant
 or participant’s insurance carrier will be billed for the cost of this 
treatment. There are no plans to compensate the participant for physical or mental 
disability, lost wages, or any other losses or damages occurring over the long term or if 
an injury becomes apparent after participation in the study has ended. However, by 
[CONTACT_4912], the participant is not waiving or giving up 
any legal rights to seek compensation. Participants who believe they have been injured 
should contact [CONTACT_079], [CONTACT_136401] at [PHONE_4412] immediately. 
e. How will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]? 
Referrals will be provided.

Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to explore the performance of PRECISION1 ® lenses on long days of lens wear.   
 
Study Overview  
This open -label study is of current soft contact [CONTACT_791821] a typi[INVESTIGATOR_791819].  Participants will be fit into PRECISION1® contact [CONTACT_13276] , or ma y be existing PRECISION1® contact [CONTACT_89626].  Participants will be assessed after [ADDRESS_1091810] lenses are associated with  less lens deposits, which decreases 
associated comfort issues in lens wearers, including decreasing the risk of triggering Giant papi[INVESTIGATOR_145902] (GPC) and/or ocular allergic responses in patients.

Key Endpoints:  
• Subjective assessment of comfort and vision at time points of extended contact [CONTACT_13279].   
• Visual Analog Scale survey of lens wear symptoms (comfort, dryness, vision)  
 
Study Time Points:  
Visit [ADDRESS_1091812]’s ocular health will occur to 
determine eligibility including positively responding to the question, “ Do you currently wear cont act 
lenses over a long day ?”  This will ensure that subjects are able and willing to participate in the study since 
long contact [CONTACT_791822].  Subjects will be asked their normal morning time for inserting 
lenses and evening time for lens remo val.  Eligible subjects can be habitual wearers of PRECISION1® 
Contact [CONTACT_791823]1® Contact [CONTACT_32993] .  Participants will be fit with PRECISION1® 
Contact [CONTACT_791824] a fit assessment and over- refraction complet ed in order to obtain 
the best fit and vision.  Upon successful fit of lenses, subjects will complete an initial survey of lens 
experience. Lenses will be dispensed to eligible participants and a second visit will be scheduled.  
Visit 2: Precision 1 f ollow -up visit  will occur approximately 1 week (±3 days) following Visit 1.  Visual acuity 
and contact [CONTACT_791825] -refraction will be completed.  If changes to the lens are 
necessary, those changes will be made and an additional follow up visit will be scheduled.  Subjects will 
be asked their normal morning time for inserting lenses and evening time for lens removal.  Subjects who 
are new to PRECISION1® Contact [CONTACT_791826] 3.  
Five e vening survey  days :  On the morning of each survey study day,  the subject will report their  time of 
lens insertion  to study staff or  by [CONTACT_791827] a RedCap survey. S tudy staff will communicate with 
participants by  [CONTACT_791828] a link to complete a brief survey at 10, 12, 14 and 16 hours of lens wear that day  
via REDCap .  The surveys will deployed on 5 days between Visit 2 and Visit 3 that are determined at the 
time of Visit 2.  Every attempt will be made to complete the surveys on business days if possible.  
Final visit : The contact [CONTACT_20935] 1 week (±3 days) following the follow 
up visit .  Subje cts will have visual acuity, an assessment of ocular health . Subjects will then complete 
surveys about their lens wear experience.  
 
Evening Surveys will include 1 -10 forced choice grading of comfort and vision.  
End of study s urveys will include VAS scales assessing: 
Overall Quality of vision

the study.

• Ability to give informed consent .  
• Subjects must have a working smart phone and be willing to download an app and/or 
receive and respond to texts  and emails.  
• Willing to spend time for the study .  Subjects will be required to attend t hree study visits, 
wear contact [CONTACT_20938] , and must respond to communications 
on a smart phone on 5 days between visits 2 and 3 .

Exclusion criteria :

Consent and Confidentiality  
  Version [ADDRESS_1091814]’s ability to consent to the study, the subject will 
be excluded from the study. If the subject agrees to take part in the screening or measurement, he or she will sign and date the most recent IRB -stamped consent as will the t eam member. The subject will be 
provided with a copy of the consent form.  
The investigator team is trained in privacy issues and will be reminded of the importance of patient privacy prior to study initiation. Potential study participants will contact [CONTACT_20940], emails or 
hearing about the study by [CONTACT_6063], giving them the choice of whether or not they wish to 
participate in a study for people with dry eyes.  Privacy is protected by [CONTACT_791830] t only, and no other personal or medical information that should be private to the 
patients. The PHI needed is only for the purposes of this study. It is highly unlikely, indeed extremely remote that the dry eye symptoms or signs are related to private or personal information that should or 
would be preferred to be kept confidential to the patients. Risk factors for dry eye rarely relate to matters 
or conditions that would be personal to the patient such as personal relationships, behaviors or diseases 
that one prefers to keep private and confidential.  
 
Statistical Analysis and Power Calculation  
This small sample size was chosen for convenience as this study  as enrollment for evening participation  
may be difficult.   
Statistical analysis will include descrip tive statistics.  
 
Data Management and Security  
During the active stages of the study (recruitment to last measurement visit), all paperwork (consents, 
questionnaires and data forms) for each subject will reside in a subject folder for easy access througho ut 
the study. The folders will reside in the limited -access research area, in a locked file drawer or cupboard. 
At the completion of the study or disenrollment of a subject the paperwork in the subject’s folders will be 
reorganized into a regulatory binder  (consents, W -9s) and a data binder (questionnaire and data forms) 
and will reside in an office in the limited -access research area. When the data analysis is completed and 
the study is considered complete, the binders will be stored in the secure Department or Office Clinical 
Research Area. Paperwork (questionnaire and data forms) for individuals who participate in the baseline 
visit but are not eligible to continue the study will be stored in the study regulatory binder in an office in 
the limited -access research area. An electronic file of potential subjects and a file of enrolled subjects with 
their contact [CONTACT_3031], as well as electronic files of collected data with the subject number, will reside on a limited -access shared drive with firewall and password protection and is restricted to individuals in 
the research team. Any electronic data files that contain PHI will be destroyed at the conclusion of the 
study.

than one minute) or mild, transient (less than a minute) stinging may occur.  
Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be documented and reported under the guidelines of The Ohio State University 
Event Reporting guidelines, with any serious, unanticipated and related events being reported to the IRB, 
by [CONTACT_978], within [ADDRESS_1091816] Dismissal  
Subjects who, after study team member coaching, are not able to provide analyzable d ata may be 
dismissed from the study. Analyzable data is, for example, that which is obtained for the entire 
measurement interval and provides a readable eye image. Data may not be analyzable if patient isn’t able 
to stand or move freely to utilize the equi pment , to name [CONTACT_505366]. These issues are usually 
revealed at the screening assessment visit. Subjects who cannot provide analyzable data will be dismissed 
for the study. Subjects who do not keep scheduled visits within the required time fram e will be dismissed 
from the study. Study team members will make reasonable efforts to accommodate subjects’ schedules.  
 
Protocol Violations, Discontinuation  
In the event that a member of the study team or a representative of sponsor becomes aware of a m ajor 
protocol violation, the IRB shall be notified within [ADDRESS_1091817] Opht halmol Vis Sci. 2015;56(8):4403- 4412.

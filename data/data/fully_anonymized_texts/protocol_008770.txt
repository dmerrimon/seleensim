1) Abstract of the study  
 Introduction: Older adults have been described as one of the most underserved and 
vulnerable groups, who are  at the highest risk for coronal and root caries, especially 
because more elderly adults are retaining their teeth. The Northeast Philadelphia 
KleinLife site is an important destination for the region’s Jewish population comprising 
of at least 6500 seniors, and assisting more than 4500 seniors through food security 
programs. Recently, Temple University Kornberg School of De ntistry (T[LOCATION_006]SoD) 
purchased the dental center at the facility to expand the services provided to these 
underserved population and improve their oral health. The study aim s to assess  the 
efficacy of an oral health education group based activity versus a n individual  based oral 
health education activity in terms of changes in oral health related quality of life 
(OHRQoL), self -efficacy  and oral health knowledge . Methods: A sample of 1 90 senior 
members will be  invited to participate in the tria l. Potential subjects will be obtained in 
person through the ongoing flow of patients at T[LOCATION_006]SoD Clinic at Kleinlife  and the dental 
school . Seniors who consent to participate in the study will be randomly allocated to one 
of the 3 groups (Control: subjects will continue receiving regular dental care at the clinic, 
Intervention 1: subjects will continue receiving regular dental care at the clinic and be 
invited to participate in 2 group based education sessions during a 12 month period, and 
Intervention 2: su bjects will continue receiving regular dental care at the clinic and be 
invited to participate i n an individual -based education and prevention activity over a 1 8 
month period. Randomization will be determined according to a predetermined random 
sequence, and neither the patient nor the research staff will be aware of the randomization 
outcome until after the patient has agreed to participat e. Subjects who consent to 
participate will be entered into a raffle to receive a $[ADDRESS_1195157], if they 
complete the baseline and follow up assessments.  The OHIP-14 will be used to assess 
OHRQoL , and self -efficacy scores will be the primary outcomes. Initially, we w ill assess 
the differences between the interventions and control using 2 -sample t-tests. The main 
analysis will be based on linear mixed -effects models for repeated measures (using the 
OHIP 14 and self -efficacy  scores as continuous outcome variables) to a ssess differences 
between intervention and control groups. Similar analyses will be conducted for 
secondary outcome measures Statistical significance will be set at p < .05.

4) Objectives  
• Primary Objective : 
The o bjective of this study is to test the efficacy of an oral health education group based 
activity versus a n individual  oral health education activity in terms of changes in oral 
health related quality of life (OHRQoL), self -efficacy and oral health knowledge .  
 
• Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective of this study is: 
a) To assess differences  among intervention and con trol groups by [CONTACT_822125]’s  oral health 
knowledge . 
 
• Overall Hypothes es 
Ho: There are no significant differences  in the selected behavioral outcome measures  
between the interventions , either group -based or individual based education  and the 
control.  
 
Ho: The two educational interventions are not equivalent in the selected behavioral 
outcome measures . 
 
 
5) Rationale and Significance  
 
Older adults or the elderly have been described as one of the most underserved and 
vulnerable groups. Many studies have shown that elderly adult population groups are at a 
higher risk for coronal and root caries, especially because more elderly adults are 
retaining their teeth. KleinLife is an important destination for the region’s Jewish 
population. KleinLife comprises of at least [ADDRESS_1195158] ry (T[LOCATION_006]SoD) recently purchased this dental center 
to expand the services provided to these underserved population and improve their oral 
health.

KleinLife is a vibrant community resource that provides social, educational and 
cultural programs, and vital health, wellness and soc ial services to the multigenera tional, 
ethnically diverse membership it serves. Individuals regularly come together to 
participate in enrichment offerings, receive vital services, enjoy each other’s company, 
and connect to additional resources and support. KleinLife is an important destination for 
the region’s Jewish population, both young and old. It serves as a lively home -away -
from -home for seniors and a welcoming gathering place for Russian Jews. More than 
[ADDRESS_1195159] been made through KleinLife.  
 
T[LOCATION_006]SoD and KleinLife’s staff conducted a survey in December [ADDRESS_1195160] mainly focused on the effects of oral health 
educational interventions for caregivers at improving dental health among seniors but 
very few interventions report on the oral health -related knowledge and other important 
behavioral outcomes of seniors  themselves . MacEntee et  al in 2007 reported no 
significant changes to oral health of seniors with a pyramid -based educational 
intervention , however, in 2012, De Visschere et  al reported a small, but statistically 
significant improvement in denture plaque following a 6 -month supervised educational 
intervention.  
 
A recent systematic review  (Kay et al, 2016)  showed that the  motivational 
intervi ewing  technique, which is based on the concept of autonomy support, has potential 
for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_857887]. However, most of the studies appraised 
involved children and young adults or seniors with periodontal conditions and the 
outcomes  examined were exclusively clinical.  Relying on clinical indicators becomes 
problematic when evaluating the efficacy of educational interventions amon g adults as 
often times  these populations  are edentulous or partially dentulous and do not reveal the 
impa ct on additional behavioral and cognitive outcomes which in turn may affect the 
overall well -being of the individual. Moreover, although low parental self -efficacy has 
been associated with adverse dental outcomes among children, there has been little 
docum ented evidence of the role of self -efficacy in adult oral health outcomes. Even less 
has been reported on groups known to be at high risk of dental disease such as the 
elderly.  There is a lack of information on how different types of oral health education  
activities may affect seniors oral health related quality of life  and self -efficacy.  These 
studies present a case for additional research on senior ’s self -efficacy, and oral health 
care knowledge , along with training interventions aimed at impro ving the p oor oral 
health of the elderly .

 Page 7 of 19 (OHRQoL), and self -efficacy among seniors at Kleinlife  and at the Dental School . A 
description of the activities to be conducted in the intervention and control groups is 
described below:  
 
Seniors who consent to participate in the study will be randomly allocated to one of 
the 3 fol lowing groups. R andomization  will be determined according to a 
predetermined random sequence, and neither the patient nor the research staff will be 
aware of the randomizatio n outcome until after the patient has agreed to 
participation.   
 
Control Group: (60 seniors).  
Seniors who are randomly assigned to the control group will continue receiving 
regular dental care under the standard clinic operation. Subjects in this group w ill 
complete intake forms to assess main behavioral outcomes, at baseline and after 12 
months. No other activities will be conducted in this group.  
 
Intervention  Group  1: (60 seniors).  
Seniors who are randomly assigned to the intervention group [ADDRESS_1195163] education session, after 6 
months and after 12 months.  
 
Intervention  Group  2: (70 seniors  (10 of these are calibrati on patients 
exclusively) ).  
Seniors who are randomly assigned to the intervention group [ADDRESS_1195164] for 1 hour each time and follow the guidelines 
established by [CONTACT_857891] a Motivational 
Interviewing approach . Tailored education will be based on review of health related 
information to be extracted from medical  (systemic diseases), dental chart  (oral 
hygiene behaviors) and patient interview at time of initial examination.  Seniors in 
this group will also receive basic preventative c are (dental cleaning s, fluoride 
varnish application (high ca ries risk individuals only) or r eferral to a supervised 
brushing program with high concentration fluoride under the care of the dentist at 
Kleinlife  if needed . All individual  based preventative ac tivities will be provided  by a 
Public Health Hygienist , and [ADDRESS_1195165] home 
based education session, at e ach follow up visit and after 1 8 months . 
 
Measurements : 
The f ollowing instruments  (Appendix C)  will serve as outcome measures for this 
 
ORAL HEALTH EDUCATION SENIORS  
 Page 8 of 19 study:  
 
• Oral Health Related Quality of Life: The Short -Form Oral Health Impact Profile 
(OHIP -14; Slade, 1997)  is a 14 -item self -report measure that assesses individuals’ 
perceptions of the social impact of oral conditions on their well -being. This scale 
evaluates the consequences of oral conditions across dimensions of functio nal 
limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, 
psychological disability, social disability, and handicap. I tems are rated on a 5 -
point Likert -type scale ranging from 0 ( never ) to 4 ( very often ), regarding how 
frequently impac t has been experienced. The total score ranges from 0 to 56; 
higher OHIP -[ADDRESS_1195166], hence poorer oral -health -related 
quality of life. The OHIP -14 has been validated in two national surveys of 
populations in the [LOCATION_006] and Australia (Kel ly et al., 1998; Steele et al., 2004) and 
demonstrated good reliability, construct and discriminant validity, and internal 
consistency (Slade & Spencer, 1994 ; Slade, 1997).   
 
• Self-efficacy will be  assessed based  on a modified version of an  instrument 
developed by [CONTACT_857892]  (Finlayson et al, 2007) . It will be  
measured using a 6 -item scale, asking participants to indicate how confident they 
feel about their ability to brush their teeth at night when they were: (1) under a lot 
of stress; (2) depressed; (3) anxious; (4) feeling that they were too busy; (5) tired 
or; (6) worried about other things in their life. The four response options range  
from ‘very confident’ to ‘not at all confident’. The possible score range is 0 to 24, 
with high scores indicating high self -efficacy. Alpha was 0.91. Self -efficacy will 
be dichotomized  based on a median split, with low self -efficacy pertaining to 
scores of 0 to 11 and high self -efficacy pertaining to scores of 12+.  
 
 
• Oral Health Knowledge : A 15-item questionnaire with a three -point Likert Scale 
(yes, no, and don’t  know) will be used to assess the oral heal th 
information/knowledge of the seniors  pre and post intervention. Its respective 
psychometric properties (validity and reliability) have alr eady been reported  
(Khanagar et al, 2014) .  
 
• Demographic Factors Questionnaire will identify key demographic factors such as 
age, sex, race, ethnicity, education and income level of seniors . 
 
Calibration:  
 
For purposes of calibration and assuring treatment fidelity of the dental public health 
hygienist when delivering the MI oral health session (Intervention 2) , [ADDRESS_1195167]  as appropriate before data collection  starts . These 10 patients 
will not be part of the research study  and will be offered a $[ADDRESS_1195168]’s availability . The calibration group 
will also sign a HIPAA Authorization form.  Please see Appendix D .  
 
 
Data Management :  
 
All demographic information and questionnaires will be administered in person . Data will 
be entered into an excel spreadsheet. Data will be downloaded to an IBM -compatible 
computer and stored on a password -protected account, and it will be exported to a 
computer data analysis program (SAS/SPSS). Data will be cleaned and checked for errors 
prior to the analysis; imputation procedures for handling missing data will be conducted 
depending on the number of cases with missing data. Participant names and 
corresponding identification numbers will be stored separately in a locked file cabine t or 
password -protected file.  
 
Data Analysis :  
 
Initial analyses will be conducted to determine normality of distributions of the 
continuous variables, and any necessary transformations will be conducted. P rimary 
outcomes will be the OHIP 14 and the self -efficacy scores . All eligible patients will be 
randomly a ssigned to 1 of the 3 groups  described above. Although randomization should 
provide relatively comparable groups, demographic variables that differ between groups 
and are correlated with the primary outcomes will be used as covariates. Preliminary 
analysis will include measures of ce ntral tendency and dispersion, as well as an 
examination of the bivariate relationships among the primary and secondary outcome 
variables, potential moderators, and demographic characteristics.  
Differences between the groups on  baseline demographic, and p sychological 
measures will be examined using χ2 (Pearson) or Student’s t-tests, as appropriate. 
Moreover, differences on the variables listed above among completers and drop -outs will 
also be explored.  Intention to treat (ITT) analyses will then be conduct ed.  
OHIP 14 and self -efficacy scores will be the primary outcomes. Initially, we will 
assess the differences between the interventions and control using 2 -sample t-tests. The 
main analysis will be based on linear mixed -effects models for repeated measures  (using 
the OHIP 14 and self -efficacy  scores  as continuous outcome variables) to assess 
differences between intervention and control groups. Similar analyses will be conducted 
for secondary outcome measures Statistical significance will be set at p < .05.   
 
 
 
e) Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study because of failure to follow 
instructions of the research staff or if the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_857888]’s best interest. Details are provided in 
the consent form.  
f) Privacy & Confidentiality  
 
ORAL HEALTH EDUCATION SENIORS  
 Page 10 of 19 As in any type of treatment or clinical research program, patients' confidentiality must be 
carefully guarded and respected. The study will use Protected Health Information (PHI) 
and a HIPAA Authorization form is being submitted with this application (see Appendix 
D). 
There will be a separate file with identifiers in receipt of the principal investigator. All 
data with identifying information will be stored in locked files or encrypted, password -
protected electronic data storage. Data being analyzed will be  identified by [CONTACT_170335] 
(using the subject identification number) and identifying information will be removed. 
The identity of patients will not be revealed in the presentation or publication of any 
results from this project. All assistants and others  working on the project will be educated 
about the importance of strictly respecting patients’ rights to privacy and confidentiality 
and will have completed training concerning proper practice in accordance with HIPAA 
regulations.  
Protected Health Informat ion that will be collected includes the patient’s name, date they 
were seen for the study, phone number , and age. In addition, dental record number, 
medical and dental chart information related to oral hygiene behaviors and systemic 
diseases will be access ed from the  dental chart for those assigned to intervention group [ADDRESS_1195169] - protected storage of electronic data. All participants will 
receive a unique random identification number, which will correspond to that person’s 
data. Participant names and corresponding identification numbers will be stored 
separately in a lock ed file cabinet or encrypted, password -protected storage of electronic 
data.  
 
8) Risks to Subjects  
No risks are expected to the subjects.  All clinical activities are part of regular dental 
treatment provided to patients in  the normal course of dental treatmen t. 
 
9) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Patients wi ll be educated about oral health risky behaviors and oral hygiene 
techniques  in this study.  There are no other direct benefits to the subject from this 
study.

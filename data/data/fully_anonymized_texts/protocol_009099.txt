 1 Introduction  
Dry eye disease (DED), also known as dry eye syndrome, is one of the most common 
ocular conditions prompting patients to seek eye care. It is prevalent in 5% -50% of the 
population, depending on the diagnostic criteria and regions of the world  investigated .[ADDRESS_145587] on physical, potentially psychological, function 
and health -related quality of life on those patients .2  It is also associated with a 
considerable economic burden and cause d an estimated loss of $3.[ADDRESS_145588] the 
structure and function of tear apparatus and ocular surface tissues, leading to altered tear, 
lipid, and mucin production .7  
Previous studies support  the efficacy of androgen treatment in relieving dry eye 
symptoms and signs related to both aqueous deficient dry eye ( ADDE) and evaporative 
dry eye ( EDE ). Worda et al .8 treated one male patient  with severe dry eye , probably of 
the aqueous deficient subtype, although this was not specified,  and low serum 
 2 testosterone levels , with 3% testosterone cream . The cream  was applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_129031] (TID) for 3 months  which brought  tear stability and lipid layer 
thickness to normal levels .8 Further, they found no increase in serum testosterone levels  
from the eyelid application .  
Transdermal s ystemic  androgen administration  has demonstrated improve d signs and 
symptoms in dry eye patients .9-11 Two retrospective case series show improvement of dry 
eye symptoms while receiving systemic androgen replacement  in women  with low 
testo sterone ; one with combined esterified estrogen and methyltestosteron e [ADDRESS_145589] in the testosterone  group were found compared to 
placebo. Further, they demonstrated a systemic increase in testosterone levels in the 
females  (to normal levels) but little change in the andropausal males.  
Golebiowski et al.11 used 1.0%  transdermal testosterone cream and 1mg/g estradiol 
gel applying  to the inner thigh daily (QD) to investigate the impact of testosterone and 
estrogen on dry eye symptoms and signs in postmenopausal women. This randomized, 
placebo -controlled study recruited 10 subjects in each treatment arm (1.0% testosterone 
cream,  1mg/g estradiol gel, 1.0% testosterone cream combined with 1mg/g estradiol, and 
placebo) . The results demonstrated increased tear secretion in the testosterone/estradiol 
combination gro up for 8 weeks  and a strong association between increased serum 
androgen and improved tear stability in the testosterone group  when running the within 
 3 group analysis . However, there  were no significant changes in total Ocular Comfort 
Index (OCI) or OSDI symptom scores nor tear function, meibomian gland function, lid 
morphology, corneal or conjunctival sensitivity  in any of the three test arms  when 
compared with  the change in the placebo groups after [ADDRESS_145590] ed that 1% testosterone  may be below the optimal therapeutic concentration, or 
local application is more effective than systemic transdermal delivery.  
Low levels of serum dehydroepi [INVESTIGATOR_2119] ( DHEA ) have been noted in patients 
with primary Sjogren syndrome due to the impaired  Hypothalamic Pi[INVESTIGATOR_117296] 
(HPA ) axis.13 In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_129032]’s syndrome, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_129033]. found that [ADDRESS_145591]

target cells only after being inactivated .34 In human s, DHEA levels in circulation reach 
maximum levels between age 20 and 30 years, decreasing by 80% by [CONTACT_14898] [ADDRESS_145598] been demonstrated  in oral testosterone intake whereas no n-oral treatment (via 
transdermal patch or cream) has no such adverse effects.[ADDRESS_145599] examined the serum levels of testosterone in relation to studies 
of dry eye treatment efficacy.9,11  
Nanavaty et al.9 applied a transdermal androgen patch in androgen deficient females 
and found that after three weeks of patch therapy the serum level of testosterone 
increased approximate ly 144%, but this brought the serum level into the normal range .39 
Supal aset et al.10 administered a  dose of 50 mg testosterone every other day for four 
weeks in men and women with decreased serum testosterone levels.  They found that 
serum levels increased approximately 17% in men and 828% in women, but both higher 
levels were within the normal testosterone range for males and females .39 Further, 20 
percent of androgen -treated subjects reported having oily skin and 4% reported acne.10  
Golebiowski et al11 also examined transdermal delivery of testosterone alone, and a  
testosterone/estradiol combination in postmenopausal women. It is unclear whether the 
 8 dose was appropriate for treating low testosterone, but there was no change in serum 
testosterone level (DHEA -S) in either testosterone -containing arm.[ADDRESS_145600] of local, transdermal application of testosterone to the eyelids is the 
affected surface area. The u pper and lower eyelid surface area is around 8% of one adult 
handprint  (the average surface area of both sides upper and lower eyelid is 14.2 cm2 (* 
1.5cm*1.5cm*2 : the area of upper and lower eyelid is close to a circle with diameter of 
the length of  horizontal eyelid fissure around 3.0 cm. 40) compared to one handprint 
180cm2 (1% of body surface area BSA 1.8m2)). The total dosage needed to cover both 
upper and lower eyelid surface s is much lower than the systemic application of androgen 
in the study of Supalaset10 (98 cm2; 7cm*14cm : the area the author used to apply 
androgen cream ).  The eyelid application is thus a small, and likely  safe dosage r elative 
to systemic safety . 
There is very little reported data concerning serum testosterone levels following 
eyelid application. Worda et al .,[ADDRESS_145601] who was testosterone deficient , applied 
3.0% testosterone cream three times daily  and had no change in serum testosterone levels 
following 2.[ADDRESS_145602] examined the likely systemic absorption of androgen applied to the upper and lower 
eyelids BID  in the dosage form currently FDA approved for androgen insufficiency 
(Natesto gel, 11 mg each single application for two eyelids or 22 mg per day total for two 
 9 applications to the eyelids per day) . This simulation and report is attached as Appendix I 
(Simulation report, v3, Z Wang, 12 -6-21).  
The assumption for the simulation was that the amount of gel necessary for one eyelid 
application was the size of a pea ([CONTACT_129086], personal communication ; email of 
11-1-21) which [CONTACT_89315] jun Wang measured to be approximately 0.122 grams. This 
represents one pump of the Natesto dispenser or 5.5 mg of testosterone delivered.42 
Applied to both eyelids at one application, this represents 11 mg total for a single 
application.  
Beginning on Page 5, the simulation demonstrates for Natesto applied once per day to 
right and left eyelids , both upper and lower eyelids  (11 mg total) that the mean increase 
in serum levels above baseline of total testosterone is about 0.15 to 0.18 ng/ml, whether 
for a single application or repeated applications over a 30 -day period (Figure 3. A – D). 
Clark et al.[ADDRESS_145603] published the weighted average range values for total testosterone (TT, 
the parameter that is measured during routine clinical laboratory assay) as 2.54 – 8.90 
ng/ml for males and 0.12 – 0.58 ng/ml for females. From the simulation, this indicates 
that male serum TT increase will be minimal and potentially double the minimum normal 
level for females , yet still possibly within the normal range  for females . It is unlikely that 
any virilization effects (e.g., facial hair growth, scalp hair loss etc.) will  be observed in 
males and it is unknown whether these same effects will occur in females.  
 
[CONTACT_129087]  has monitored patients who were using testosterone cream applied to the 
eyelids twice a day for at least 3 years and found no elevation in IOP .41 In another study, 
Connor observed that short term treatment with 5% transdermal testosterone cream for 
 10 dry eye enhances female patient TBUT but doesn’t significantly impact the patient’s 
blood pressure .43 
In our proposed study, we will monitor total serum testosterone levels in all subjects 
at baseline, and within two hours of the morning eyelid dose at the four-week visit (end 
of dosing). Until this blood work is accomplished, the effects of 4.5% eyelid testosterone 
gel applied BID will remain unknown.  
Research Rational e  
Androgen , especially when topi[INVESTIGATOR_129037], appears to be effective  in 
management of dry eye disease due to its impact on function of tear apparatus .[ADDRESS_145604] type (e.g., both males and females were not uniformly 
enrolled), the androgen status and serum levels were not assessed prior to, or  following 
androgen application and the studies were only published as peer-reviewed abstracts  and 
mostly were done in one lab oratory . This prospective randomized, c ontrolled double 
masked  study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_129038] a population of patients with evaporative dry 
eye associated with meibomian gland dystrophy  and aqueous tear deficient dry eye .  
 11  
Methods  
Study objective  
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of an FDA -approved androgen nasal supplement 
(Natesto, A cerus Pharma ceuticals Corporation , 4.5% gel concentration) in males and 
females with dry eye of either aqueous tear deficiency or evaporative subtype.  
Clinical hypothesis  
• Natesto  applied to upper and lower  eyelid skin is more effective than placebo  
as measured by [CONTACT_129061] (TBUT) and mean scores for 
meibomian secretion quality at 4 weeks and overall ocular comfort at 8 weeks .  
• Natesto  has an acceptable safety profile in ocular structure s and general 
systemic system.  
Statistical Hypotheses : 
 
Ho:  There is no difference in change from baseline to week four for either fluorescein 
breakup time  (TBUT)  or meibomian secretion score (0 – 24 scale) between the test and 
placebo -treated sample.   
 
HA:  There is a difference in the change from baseline  to week four for either fluorescein 
breakup time (TBUT) or meibomian secretion score (0 – 24 scale) between the test and 
placebo -treated sample  
 
Overall study design  
Structure  
 
We propose a randomized control led trial ( RCT ) of one month duration dosing BID with 
an FDA -approved androgen nasal supplement (Natesto, A cerus Pharma ceuticals 
 12 Corporation , 4.5% gel concentration) in males and females with dry eye of either aqueous 
tear deficiency or evaporative subtype.  
The test formulation will be marketed Natesto gel, containing 5.5 mg testosterone per 
pump (17β-Hydroxyandrost -4-en-3-one; inactive ingredients are castor oil, oleoyl 
polyoxylglycerides and colloidal silicone dioxide; Natesto package insert). T he placebo is 
the exact same formulation without 17β-Hydroxyandrost -4-en-3-one. The drug and 
placebo will be deliv ered to and  dispensed by [CONTACT_129062]’s study use .  
Dosage regimen  
 
One dose per eyelid of masked gel, which is one pump from the dispenser, represents 5.5 
mg for each eyelid,  will be applied on the surface of upper and lower eyelid skin each eye 
twice per day ( separated by 8 hours)  for a total daily dose of 22mg .  
Duration  
 
2-week screening period; 4-week masked treatment phase, 8 -week washout phase. 
Overall study duration 1 4 weeks

(using 2.0 microliters of 1.0% sodium fluorescein) and the system for meibomian 
gland secretion (0-24 scale) are recommended by [CONTACT_129063].[ADDRESS_145606] Deviation (SD) following treatment of 2.5 seconds. The results are as 
follow:  
• 2-Sample t Test  
• Testing mean 1 = mean 2 (versus ≠)  
• Calculating power for mean 1 = mean 2 + difference  
• α = 0.05    
• Assumed standard deviation = 2.5

Randomiz ation  method  
Due to the  relatively  small sample size (n  < 200) and the need to control and 
balance the influence of covariates, such as age and sex, we adopt ed the method of 
covariate adaptive randomization .45 With two covariates of sex (2 levels:  male, 
female) and  age (2 levels: <50, >50 ) between study arms (treatment and control), a 
total of [ADDRESS_145607] 10 participants will be  assigned to one of the 
treatment group s within each block by [CONTACT_129064], according to a 
randomization scheme ( [CONTACT_129088]  will generate this) . The next new 
participant is then sequentially assigned to a particular treatment group by 
[CONTACT_129065]. For 
example, the first 10 participants assignment are broken down by [CONTACT_129066] 3. Then  the 11th participant , who is male and >50 years old, needs to be 
assigned to a g roup (control vs . treatment). Based on the characteristics of the 11th 
participant, the method add s marginal totals of the corresponding covariate categories 
for each group and compares the totals. The participant is assigned to the group with 
the lower covariate total to minimize imbalance. In this example, the appropriate 
categories are male and > 50 years old, which results in a total of 6 (3 for male and 3 
for >50)  for the  control group and a total of 5  (3 for male and 2 for >50) for  the 
 18 treatment group. Because the sum of marginal totals is lower in treatment group 
(5<6), the 11th participant is assigned to the treatment group.

Study Procedures  
General Procedures  
4. All procedures w ill be  conducted on both eyes of the subject.  After the completion 
of data collection and the determination that the data collected on both eyes on all 
subjects are of equal quality and reliability, the worst eye with the staining score is 
selected for analysis.  If the staining score s for the two eyes are the same , the 
secretion grade is used as the tie breaker. If both the staining score s and secretion 
grade s are the same, a random eye is selected by [CONTACT_51437][INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin.  Table 4 is the 
summary of all related proced ures in our study.  
Guidelines for Visit Preparation  
5. Subjects are required to refrain from using any eye drops or artificial tears for a 
minimum of 12 hours prior to their visit  and dilation drops within 1 week prior to 
their visit . Subjects w ill be  asked to refrain from any eye rubbing, eye makeup, or 
facial products ( e.g., creams, lotions) near the eyes on the day of the study.  Table 5 
shows the schedule for all the visits and procedures

Dry eye classification  
 
Data from Procedure II w ill be  analyzed, and each subject w ill be 
classified as moderate or severe ADDE or EDE -related to MGD; d etailed 
classification scheme  follows.  
 30 Detailed Description of Selected Tests  
Fluorescein Tear Break -Up Time (TBUT)  
6. Liquid sodium fluorescein (NaFl) w ill be  used to visualize the breakup time. The 
dye will be  sourced from Greenpark compounding pharmacy (Houston TX, [LOCATION_003]) 
in 4 ml “droptainers” for study use. An amount of 2.0 µl of 1.0% wt./vol 
preservative -free NaFl was instilled using sterile pi[INVESTIGATOR_129044] a calibrated 
micropi[INVESTIGATOR_8462]. The NaFl dye was stored at 4°C when not in use. Once opened, each 
bottle of dye was labeled with the date of opening and discarded after 28 days. The 
slit lamp biomicroscope was utilized to  visualize the cornea with high illumination 
of cobalt blue light, wide beam (~14mm round), and 16x magnification. A yellow 
#12, 55mm Tiffen filter was held in front of the slit lamp optics to enhance 
observation of TBUT. A hand -held stopwatch was used to measure TBUT to the 
nearest 1/10th of a second.  
7. The examiner ha s the subjects tilt their head back and look inferiorly while the 
examiner lifted the right upper eyelid to instill 2.0 µl of 1.0% wt./vol. preservative -
free NaFl dye onto the superior bulbar conjunctiva of the right eye, and the process 
was repeated for the left eye.[ADDRESS_145618] such that tear break up time could  not be measured, the investigator 
instilled an additional 2.0 µl of 1.0% wt./vol. preservative -free NaFl via pi[INVESTIGATOR_129045] -instillati on was necessary. The amount of 
 [ADDRESS_145619] is asked to undertake three natural blinks (i.e., not rapid or “squeeze” 
blinks) and then to hold the eyelids open  while looking at one spot . The first sign 
of break up (dark spot or change) is recorded to the nearest tenth of a  second. 
Following the first measurement a twenty to thirty second rest period of eye closure 
is allotted for the patient to re -establish tear stability before measuring the other 
eye. A minimum of t hree measurements are taken for each eye with the rest period 
between eac h measurement, alternating between eyes. If a measurement is deemed 
unreliable ( i.e., if a subject did not follow instructions, observation is uncertain, or 
if the tear film contain s too much debris) a fourth measurement is taken and the 
unreliable value is recorded. The mean of the three TBUT measurements , not 
including the unreliable measurement,  is also  recorded for each eye.  
Corneal Staining  
1. The slit lamp used to view the corneal staining is set at maximum illumination on 
cobalt blue filter, 14 mm round beam, and medium (16x) magnification. 
Additionally, a yellow #12, 55mm Tiffen filter is used to maximize visibility of the 
fluorescein staining.  
2. Corneal staining is evaluated immediately following TBUT without additional 
instillation of NaFl solution. Observations  are made shortly after TBUT evaluation 
because the fluorescein diffuses rapi[INVESTIGATOR_129046].55,59,60 If not enough dye is 
present to evaluate fluorescein staining due to quick lacrimal drainage, study 
 32 procedures allow for an additional amount of fluorescein to be instilled prior to 
grading.  
3. National Eye Institute  (NEI) systems. The NEI scheme has an integer severity scale 
of 0 to 3 for each of five corneal sectors for a total corneal scale of 15.54-56 For NEI 
schemes, the scales are outlined with illustrated grading panels (Appendix III, Case 
report form).  The scales assess the area, but not depth,  of punctate staining, which 
increase on a log scale, with the highest number being the most staining and most 
severe. When the examiner grade d the level of staining , the grading panels were  
readily visible  and referenced during the evaluation.  
4. Corneal staining evaluation is quantified using the O cular Staining Score (OSS) 
(only at screening and baseline) .61 Punctate epi[INVESTIGATOR_129047] (PEE) that stain with 
fluorescein are counted, and scored. If there are no PEE, the score is 0. If 1 -5 PEE 
are seen, the corneal score is 1 (Appendix I V); 6-10 PEE are scored as 2; and >30 
PEE are scored as 3. An additional point is added if 1) PEE occurred in the central 
4mm diameter portion of the cornea; 2) one or more filaments are seen anywhere 
on the cornea; or 3) one or more patches of confluent staining, including linear 
stains, are  found anywhere on the cornea. The tot al fluorescein score for the cornea 
(the PEE grade plus any extra points for modifiers) is noted in the central square of 
the SICCA ocular staining score form (Appendix I V). The maximum possible score 
for each cornea is 6.  
Conjunctival Staining  
9. A sterile lissamine green strip is wetted with a drop of sterile saline solution. The 
dye is applied on the superior bulbar conjunctiva on the right eye, followed by [CONTACT_941] 
 [ADDRESS_145620], and analysis is 
performed immediately after the dye was applied. The slit lamp biomicroscope is 
immediately utilized to visualize the bulbar conjunctiva with moderate high 
illumination of white light, wide beam (~14mm round), and 16x magnification. The 
subject is asked to look opposite to the side of the conjunctiva being visualized in 
order to reveal more of the conjunctiva clearly.  
10. Conjunctival  staining evaluation is quantified using the OSS and NEI systems. In 
the OSS, grade 0 is defined as 0 -9 dots of lissamine green staining of the 
interpalpebral bulbar conjunctiva (nasal and temporal conjunctivae graded 
separately); grade 1 is defined as the presence of 10 to 32 dots; grade 2 as 33 to 
100; and grade 3 >100 dots. Because of the difficulty of counting individual dots 
in a moving eye at the slit lamp, any area of confluent staining >=4 mm2 is 
considered to be >100 dots. Nasal and tem poral areas of the conjunctiva are graded 
separately with a maximum score of three for each area or a total maximum score 
of 6 for each eye. The total OSS for each eye is the summation of the fluorescein 
score for the cornea and the lis samine green scores for the nasal and temporal bulbar 
conjunctiva.61  The NEI scheme has an integer severity scale of 0 to 3 for each of 
six conjunctival sections (three sections each nasal and temporal sides) for a total 
corneal scale of 0 -18.54-56 For both schemes, the scales are outlined with illustrated 
grading panels (Appendix II I Case Report form) . The scales assess the area, but not 
depth,  of punctate staining, which increase on a log scale, with the highest number 
being the most staining and most severe. When the examiner grade s the level of 
staining , the grading panels are readily visible  and referenced during the evaluation.  
 34 Meibum Gland Excreta Grading   
1. Procedure:   Gland expression is assessed using a slit -lamp biomicroscope at 
medium (16x) magnification, moderate white light and a wide, 14 mm diffuse 
beam. A constant pressure device, the Meibomian Gland Evaluator (MGE) 
developed by [CONTACT_129072] [ADDRESS_145621]’s hand . The subject is instructed to look up and away from the Q -tip 
or the MGE for the duration of the procedure. To clean the eyelid margin, the 
investigator gently pulled the skin down by [CONTACT_129073] a ccidental expression of the meibomian 
glands. Once the eyelid margin is revealed, it is gently wiped with a moistened  Q-
tip. The investigator held the MGE 1-[ADDRESS_145622]’s lower eyelid at the base of the lash line to locally push the tarsal plate of 
the lower eyelid against the globe to express the meibomian glands. As the MGE is 
applied, it is angled down and t he pressure was held for 10 – 15 seconds, watching 
for oil excretion from the glands to evaluate both the secretion quality and number 
of glands expre ssing oil. Expression proceed s targeting approximately 8 glands at 
the center of lower eyelid . Expression grade and secretion quality are graded 
individually . The procedure is repeated for each eye.  
 35 2. Grading Scales:   Grading is based on the average appearance of the center lower 
eyelid region o f a single eye. The Bron scale , initially proposed in 1991,62 is utilized 
for Meibomian secretion quality, which uses the color and viscosity of the excreta 
observed graded on a scale of 0 to 3 , as described in  Table 6.6,57

Schirmer [ADDRESS_145623] ’s eyes gently 
closed. The  subject  is told to look upward and blink normally while the strip is 
placed in the right eye then the left. The Schirmer strips are placed at the junction 
of the middle and lateral one -third of the lower eyelid. After five minutes the strips 
are removed,  and the amount of wetting is recorded in millimeters. While in the 
subject ’s eye, the strip is monitored carefully; if after [ADDRESS_145624] strip with skin oil from the

Meibography  with Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_129043]  ( TearScience, Morrisville, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003])  
1. The Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_129043] (Tear  Science, Morrisville, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]) instrument is 
used to assess the area of Meibomian gland loss. Images of the subject’s eyes are 
saved on a password protect ed Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_129048]. The 
images are transferred to a flash drive then to a secure research computer for 
analysis using Image J software for percent Meibomian glands remaining.  
2. The subject is seated in front of the instrument with their forehead against the bar. 
Ambient room lighting is on but slightly dimmed. The lower eyelid  is everted using 
the curved instrument transillumination device to visualize the silhouette of the 
meibomian glands under the palpebral conjunctiva, and the subject is instructed to 
look up.  The subject’s head is turned slightly away from the examiner, until both 
canthi are equally focused in the frame and the puncta identifiable in the image. 
Images are then captured. This procedure is repeated for the upper eyelid, using a 
cotton swab to evert the upper eyelid while instructing the subject to look down. 
The upper image is taken with reflected IR only, rather than using transillumination 
lighting, since the instrument does not allow transillumination of the upper eyelids. 
Both the upper and lower eyelids are imaged since it has been demonstrated that

16. Dry eye classification   
Subjects are classified as dry eye patients if they met 2 out of the 3 following 
criteria:  TBUT equal to or lower than 6 seconds, dry eye criteria on the NEI staining 
scale, and dry eye criteria on either meibomian gland expression grade or meibomian 
gland drop out (Meiboscore). Subjects in Evaporative/MGD group will be classified 
by [CONTACT_129076].  [ADDRESS_145626] will be enrolled  is summarized in 
 38 Appendix III: Dry Eye Classification Criteria  and Appendix V: Staging the Severity of 
MGD -Related Ocular Surface Disease  
 
17. General statistical methods and types of analyses  
• Comparisons, ANOVA, meibomian secretion scores, meibomian gland dropouts, 
OSDI  
• The primary visit is week 4 and primary efficacy variables are the FTBUT and 
quality of meibomian secretions  
• A two -sided test with p -value less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered as 
statistically significant.  
18. Comparisons between pairs of treatment groups will be done with Cochran -Mantel 
Haenszel  (CMH) tests, stratified by [CONTACT_129077]. Within Strata 
comparisons will be done with Wilcoxon rank -sum tests for both ordinal and 
continuous variables. For nominal variables, within strata comparisons will be done 
with Pearson’s chi -square or Fisher’s exact tests.  
 
19. Exploratory pharmacokinetics data analysis  
• Summary statistics of testosterone, dihydrosterosterone, and [ADDRESS_145627] participation in this study may be inspected by [CONTACT_129078] (e.g., by [CONTACT_3133], FDA ), by

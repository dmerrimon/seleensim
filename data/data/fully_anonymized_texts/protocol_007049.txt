 RESEARCH PROTOCOL    
 
TITLE:   A Study on the Use of Real -Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (RT -CGM ) in Gestational 
Diabetes  
 
 
A. Specific Aims / Hypothesis:  We hypothesize  that use RT -CGM in those with gestational diabetes will 
improve/ reduce glycemic variability  in pregnancy and potentially improve fetal and maternal outcomes .  
Aim 1 .Evaluate if  Real Time Con tinuous Glucose Monitoring improves mean glucose, time in range,  time 
above and below range , mean amplitude of glycemic excursions  (MAGES ) and standard deviation of blood 
sugars and coefficient of variation (CV)  
Aim 2 .Evaluate if i mproved glycemic variability improves fetal and maternal outcomes  in pregnancies affected 
by [CONTACT_30150].  
Aim 3 : Evaluate participants’ perceptio n of RT -CGM use in pregnancies affected by [CONTACT_30150] . 
Aim 4 : Evaluat e nutritional and l ifestyle changes  in GDM and pregnancy and effect of RT -CGM   
Aim 5 : Evaluate if RT -CGM decreases need for initiation of oral diabetes medication and/or insulin.  If insulin 
initiated, evaluate if RT -CGM reduces cumulative insulin dose.   
Aim 6: Evaluate nocturnal hypoglycemia in pregnancy and if RT - CGM lessens nocturnal hypoglycemia   
 
 
B. Background and Significance  
 Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has increased given improved sensor accuracy, greater 
convenience and ease of use, and expanding reimbursement. However, utilization of CGM technology in clinical practice, especially in gestational diabetes , remains low given paucity of clinical data. In February 2019, the 
Advanced Technologies  & Treatments for Diabetes  Congress convened an international expert  panel  to discuss 
this issue  but because of the lack of evidence for CGM targets for women with gestational diabetes mellitus 
(GDM) , percentages of time spent in range, below range, and above range were not included  (1). Currently data 
are limited and studies are needed to show efficacy of this technology and thus we are conducting a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30132] . 
  
 
C. Preliminary Studies  
Many studies have demonstrated that  RT-CGM can be used in adults and children with both Type 1 and 
Type 2 diabetes resulting in improvement in HbA1c and/or a reduced frequency of hypoglycemia (2-4) . Our 
initial research showed that the use of RT -CGM serially over 3 months improved HbA1c by [CONTACT_5554] 1.0% 
in subjects with Type 2 diabetes on no prandial insulin (5). Nutrition and activity changes were not measured 
but the 3- month HbA1c improvement was sustained for another 9 months without further RT -CGM intervention 
(6) but otherwise data is limited in type 2 diabetes and CGM use. Similarly, data in GDM  and CGM use  is 
limited : The largest study on GDM did show that standard deviation of blood glucose, mean amplitude of 
glycemic excursion  (MAGEs)  , and mean of daily differences values were significantly lower in the CGM 
group compared with those in the routine care group (P < .001) (7). A more recent study which reviewed 
 
  
Version 3, October [ADDRESS_29487] trimester glycemic variability in non -insulin -dependent gestational diabetes mellitus 
failed  to show any adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes but did not report mean glucose  (8). One  recent study 
highlights that even more stringent targets may  be needed  (9) and  another the importance of  CGM mean 
glucose and time in range especially overnight  (10) where data from traditional fingersticks is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_30133].  
 
 
D. Research  Recruitment and Population   
 
A maximum number of 130 participants will be recruited that meet inclusion/exclusion criteria for the 
study. Dropouts will be replaced on a one -to-one basis as n eeded to reach a total of 95 completed/evaluable 
participants.  Recruitment information about the study will be made available to all obstetrics and gynecological 
medical personnel including medical assistants, nursing staff , and physician and physician extenders at the 
University of Washington and associated obstetric  sites by [CONTACT_30151] 
(Appendix F).  Information about the study will be made available to patients by a study f lier (Appendix H) 
which will provide contact [CONTACT_30152]. If  potential participants express interest in the 
study to medical staff , permission for the study coordinator to contact [CONTACT_30153] . A HIPAA 
Partial Waiver of Research Subject Authorization Request (HRP -281) will be requested if needed  so that the 
study coordinator(s) can pre -screen provider’s clinics and approach potential eligible subjects at the time of 
their visit.  This may also be used to complete a database search to identify potential eligible subjects ahead of a 
clinic visit that have elevated A1c or positive oral glucose tolerance test . 
  
Subjects may also be identified through posters and flyers placed in the  community, as well as through all 
University of Washington clinics and in the broader community through w ebsite s and other advertisement s. 
Potential subjects who satisfy the study criteria and express interest in the study will be given information about 
participation either by [CONTACT_2319], email or a phone call . Eligibility questions will be asked but no study related 
procedure will be performed until informed consent/authorization has  been obtained (see Appendix C ).  
 
Please note that pre- screening questions are done prior to consent then once the participant has signed consents 
further screening will be completed.  
The initial contact [CONTACT_30154] a call to ask the participant if they would like more 
information about the study after the study has been introduced by [CONTACT_30155]. If they say yes, a brief 
explanation about the study is provided. They are asked if they have questions and are asked if they would to 
receive a copy of the consent as an informational packet that they can discu ss with family members and their 
caregiver. They are then asked if we can call them in follow - up after they receive the consent.  
 
 
The study s creening and research procedures will take place at the University of Washington Maternal Infant 
Care Clinic and other ancillary OB and neighborhood clinic sites of the University of Washington including: 
Northwest  and Montlake Campuses , local Neighborhood clinics , as well  remote clinics  (Arlington and Yakima 
OB Clinic s). If possible, the  visit will be performed in person, but, given the increase in  telehealth  visits during 
 
  
Version 3, October 2024  Page 6 of 22 the COVID pandemic , if a potential participant  is unable to couple the screening visit and/ or research visits with 
standard OB appointments , then  televisits for the research visit s will be offered.  
 
 Population:   
We propose to perform an observational prospective study that will involve 100 subjects with confirmed 
gestational diabetes.  There will be 50 participants in the CGM intervention group and 50 in control group. 
Patients with pre -existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes will be excluded as will overt diabetes (Hba1c >6.5) on 
initial gestational diabetes screening and /or POC Hba1c.  Gestational diabetes scr eening  by [CONTACT_30156]/ or Hb A1c is performed in the  OB clinic at initial  early prenatal visit or [ADDRESS_29488] population to recruit from . We do not see recruitment as an 
issue. We will also extend our recruitment to the Arlington and Yakima consult clinics, wh ich see patients  from 
the surrounding areas  to increase diversity of our population as for example Seattle’s  demographics is  11% 
Hispanic while  Yakima is 43%.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
E. Statistical Considerations  
 Sample Size Estimation  
 
The HbA1C outcome was used for the sample size calculation. Since we are collecting Hb A1C every [ADDRESS_29489] size 'f' of 0.14, 
which is between small (0.10) and medium (0.25), an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.80, we need a total of 92 
study subjects. Allowing for some attrition in study subjects, we are planning to enroll 100 patients.  
 Note that this type of sample estimation requires that we specify the variance across observations (sphericity) 
and the correlation across observations. We specified both at 0.60.  We calculated sample size using G*Power.   
 
Data Analysis Plan  
The data analysis will start with completion of the CONSORT diagram, with an analysis of differences between 
those who completed the study and those who did not (t -tests and chi -square tests, as needed, comparing basic 
demographics and baseline health characteristics), so that the researchers in this area can under stand the extent to 
which our study contains bias.  
Next, we will calculate summary statistics (means, medians, proportions, etc.) of all baseline measurements, overall 
and by [CONTACT_30157], so that we can fully characterize the study cohort .  
 
  
Version 3, October 2024  Page 7 of 22 Using the CGM data, we will graph each participant’s  trajectories over time and review each, examining for 
major patterns in the trajectories. Note that typi[INVESTIGATOR_30134]; 
however, this approach will allow for understanding of heterogeneity. As part of this examination of the CGM 
data, the analysis will calculate each participant’s measures of glycemic variability (such as mean amplitude of 
glycemic excursions, coefficient of variation, etc.), Hb A1C values, and fructosamine values and overlay them 
on each graph. This part of the analysis is predominantly exploratory.  
 
For the statistical, hypothesis -testing examinations of Hb A1C, fructosamine, CGM readings, and glycemic 
variability across key time points, we will conduct mixed models (i.e., multilevel model) analyses, which will allow us to quantify within- between interactions, or changes within subjects over time and differences across 
groups. These models can also include multiple independent variables/ covariates.

Version 3, October 2024  Page 8 of 22 G. Diagnosis of GDM : 
Per UW protocol  and based upon the ACOG Practice Bulletin on gestational diabetes  early 
screening for GDM  prior to [ADDRESS_29490] trimester  in 
those at high risk especially in  the overweight or obese (BMI ≥25 or ≥23 for Asian) 
 
Screening Strategy for Detecting Pregestational Diabetes or Early Gestational Diabetes 
Mellitus (consider testing in all overweight/obese women ( i.e. BMI ≥25 or ≥23 for Asian 
Americans) with one of more of the following risk factors:  
 
Physical inactivity  
First-degree relative with diabetes  
High -risk race or ethnicity (African American, Latino, Native American, Asian Americans, 
Pacific Islander)  
Prior infant weighing ≥4000g (~9lbs)  
Previous GDM  
Hypertension (140/90 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension)  
High -density lipoprotein cholesterol level <35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L),  
Triglyceride level >250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L)  
Polycystic ovarian syndrome  
Hemoglobin A1C ≥5.7%, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose on previous 
testing  
Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (ex: pre -pregnancy BMI ≥40, 
acanthosis nigricans)  
History of cardiovascular disease  
 
Early Screening & Diagnosis of GDM : 
Screening may include early HbA1C in the above higher risk population. Per UW protocol interpretation of HbA1C will be:  
-HbA1C ≥ 6.5% is diagnostic of pre -gestational DM. Diabetes education and therapy should be initiated as soon 
as possible and given pre -gestational DM  will be excluded from the study  
-HbA1C 6.0- 6.4% may be considered diagnostic of GDM but confirmation testing with [ADDRESS_29491] of care. OB providers will ask patients to complete the 3 hour GTT. 
However, given potential exposure in 3- hour testing during the COVID -19 pandemic if patients decline then 
HbA1C ≥ 6.0% will be used for enrollment  
 -HbA1c 5.7- 5.9% should be considered concerning for impaired glucose tolerance. Local protocol is  re-
evaluation for GDM with a [ADDRESS_29492] for HbA1c instead, then HbA1C ≥  6.0% may be used for enrollment.  
-HbA1c <5.7% is normal; these women will have routine GDM screening at 24- 28 weeks  
 
Routine Screening & Diagnosis of GDM  
We will use the 2 step protocol with oral glucose tolerance testing for diagnosis. For the glucola (50g) we will use a 1 -hour cutoff of >140 or HbA1C ≥  6.0% followed by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_29493] level of 180mg/dl will be considered diagnostic of GDM without proceeding to a 3- hour GTT. 
In select situations based on either clinician’s assessment or patient’s refusal to accept diagnosis based on the 
 
  
Version 3, October [ADDRESS_29494] results between 180-200mg/dL. A follow up 3- hour GTT is 
not required for any patient with a GCT ≥200mg/dL, as that value is sufficient for the diagnosis of GDM.  
 
If the patient has an elevated glucola then the 100- g 3-hour GTT should be performed. This will include a 
fasting blood sugar, and a 1, 2, and 3-hour post GTT plasma glucose levels will be measured. The diagnosis of 
GDM is based if at least two of the four plasma glucose levels are met of exceeded using the Carpenter/Coustan 
criteria as outlined by [CONTACT_30158] (reference). The values are fasting 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), 1- hr 180 mg/dL 
(10.0 mmol/L), 2-hour 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L),  and 3-hour 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) .

H. Study Design   
Study Design: Interested volunteers will be screened by [CONTACT_30159] a screening visit (week 0). If potential participants express interest, they will be 
provided an email address or phone number to call for more information. Alternatively, participants will be 
asked if they would like to be called to receive more information and are willing to provid e their contact 
[CONTACT_30160]. If after receiving more information, the potential participant is interested, then pre -
screening questions (appendix D) will be asked.  If still eligible, then a screening appointment will be arranged 
by [CONTACT_464]. If the participant is not interested in participating  the participant will continue standard OB care 
for gestational diabetes . 
 
Study visits and intervention : Upon arriving to the pre -intervention visit, informed consent will be obtained 
after which a point of care HbA1c (if no HbA1c available within the last 2 weeks) will be obtained and oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and or HbA1c results reviewed  and inclusion/exclusion criteria reviewed.  At the 
pre-intervention session (week 0) the control group will wear CGM for 10 days blinded. The intervention group 
will be given CGM training and instructions and start Real Time -CGM (RT -CGM). Controls will be asked to 
follow their OB provider’s instructions for checking blood sugar via capi[INVESTIGATOR_30135] (ie fingersticks). If 
no recommendations have been given, instructions will be to start checking fingersticks fasting and [ADDRESS_29495]-
meal s, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_30136]. All participants will be asked to write their glucose levels/results 
in a log provided. RT -CGM participants will be asked to review their RT -CGM and write down their  fasting 
glucose in am,  prior to each meal and [ADDRESS_29496]- meal . As well they will be instructed to document any 
sugars <60mg/dl seen by [CONTACT_30161].  
 
 Participants will then follow -up at week 2 (session 2) at which time the control group will have their  blinded 
CGM data collected  and the RT -CGM group will download their CGM data and ensure CGM working 
appropriately. The control group will continue to monitor fingerstick blood glucose as recommended by [CONTACT_30162] 3, October 2024  Page 10 of 22 pregnancy obstetric provider.  The intervention group will continue the RT -CGM device and will be instructed 
to continue fingersticks only when concerned for hypoglycemia and/or inaccuracy of sensor.  The control and 
intervention groups will follow -up serially for the duration of pregnancy (see schematic for visits below). The 
control group will wear the blinded CGM at serial timepoints throughout pregnancy and the intervention group 
will have serial do wnload of RT - CGM. Participants will also have labs checked every [ADDRESS_29497] 4 visits (estimating a pregnancy duration of 40 weeks). Some participants 
may receive a diagnosis of gestational diabetes earlier and thus have more sessions. Maternal and neonatal 
outcomes will be abstracted from delivery records.

Screening/Pre- Intervention Visit(week 0) : 
Consent (appendix R ) will be obtain ed prior to any screening procedures being completed, and conducted in a 
quiet room  or private televisit. Participant will be given ample time to ask questions, and a copy of the signed 
consent form will be given prior to start of screening visit . Participants will fill out a contact [CONTACT_982], including 
emergency contact . Study staff will review medical history  and medications , pregnancy history, patient’s 
mother’s pregnancy history, sleep history, and lipid profile if available  (appe ndix D ), as well as all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria .  
 
Vital signs will be collected, including height, weight (current and  pre-pregnancy ), blood pressure, maternal 
resting heart rate, and  estimated gestation al age. Maternal ultrasound results will be review ed if available.  
Glucose tolerence test results will be reviewed.  Two blood pressure and pulse readings will be taken and 
HbA1c, both point of care (finger strick)  and HbA1c serum and fructosamine via LabCorp will be obtained.  
Approximately [ADDRESS_29498] 
within 2 weeks of the pre -intervention session, then the point of care HbA1c will not be done. The available 
HA1c will be used.  If they meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria (as outlined above), they will be randomized 
into either the RT -CGM intervention or control arm at the screening visit.  
 
At the pre -intervention session (week 0) the control GDM group will be asked to wear the CGM blinded  for [ADDRESS_29499] may be asked to repeat this measurement at an unscheduled 
visit. The c ontrol group with be given a glucose meter (onetouch) and instructed to  follow their obstetric 
provider’s recommendations about checking glucose by [CONTACT_30163] 1 hour after meals . They will also 
be given a  a handout that explains glucose goals and how food and activity  effects glucose levels . (Appendix 
A1,A2).  The i ntervention group will be given RT -CGM and instructed on use with a handout that explains  
glucose goals and how food and act ivity effects glucose levels (see handout /Appendix A). The i ntervention 
group will also be given a glucose meter  (onetouch) and instructed to use for symptoms of low glucose or if 
they question the accuracy of the CGM.  Both groups with be given standard gestational  diabetes  teaching and 
nutrition counseling by [CONTACT_30164], as per 
current local standard of care .  
 
 
  
Version 3, October 2024  Page 12 of 22 Participants will be given self-report questionnaires on physical activity, nutrition , sleep history, pregnancy 
history and overall wellness . Week 0 consenting and base line data/measurements will take between 1 hour 30 
minutes and 2 hours.

Between Visits : In the weeks between visits participants will continue their routine OB care with their OB 
providers. The OB providers may or may not be aware that their patient is participating in the study or have 
knowledge of their study group allocation. The participants will provide their OB providers the usual blood 
sugar values that they typi[INVESTIGATOR_30139]. For the control group this wi ll be fingerstick 
glucose values for fasting and 1- hr post -meals. For the intervention group, this will be a log of the CGM 
 
  
Version 3, October [ADDRESS_29502] -meals. The OB providers will not be expected to use the 
CGM system itself.   
 
Delivery : EMR will be reviewed  for maternal and fetal outcomes .  
 
 
 I. Randomization/allotment:  Randomization/allotment:  Once they have signed the consent form, study 
participants will be randomized to treatment group. The project will use random, permuted blocks within strata 
to do this. Two participant factors will be considered in creating the strata: 1) weeks pregnant ( 14-24 weeks or 
28 weeks); and 2) pre -pregnancy BMI (</= 35 and >35). Thus, the  strata will be:  
 
Pregnant 14- 24 weeks and BMI ≤ 35 
 Pregnant >2 4 weeks and BMI ≤  35 
 Pregnant 14- 24 weeks and BMI >35  
Pregnant >24 weeks and BMI >35.  
 
 Separate randomization lists will then be prepared for each of the above strata, using random permuted blocks 
generated in SAS 9.4. The lists will be transferred (by [CONTACT_30165]) to a sequence of sealed envelopes with the treatment group noted on a c ard within.  
  Since this is a small clinical trial, there is the potential problem of uneven distribution of study participants 
across the strata.  However, we believe we have mitigated this potential by [CONTACT_30166] [ADDRESS_29503] than other  approaches (such as the minimization method) due to the 
relatively greater level of staffing effort required for those approaches to work.

J. Study Procedures, Materials and Devices : 
 
Televisits:  
Preference will be to conduct screening visits and all study visits in person coupled to standard OB visits. 
However as COVID-19 pandemic continues more OB patients are using tele health visits for routine OB care. If 
patient is not scheduled for in  person OB visit during study visit window then reseach visit will be schedule d 
via telehealth. The University of Washington uses the ZOOM platform which is HIPPA compliant and ensures 
patient  privacy during the visit .  
 Medical Devices :  
 
CGM  (DEXCOM G6 ): A continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) is a way to measure glucose levels in real -time 
throughout the day and night. A tiny electrode called a glucose sensor is inserted under the skin by a skin prick 
to measure glucose levels in tissue fluid. A small plastic pi[INVESTIGATOR_30140]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897],  
one cannot feel this tubing once inserted. It is connected to a transmitter that sits on top of the skin and is  about 
the size of a quarter. It is attached  or secured by [CONTACT_30167] ’s skin. It is approved for use on the 
abdomen for 10 days.  The CGM  either records the blood sugars which we will then download in our clinic  at 
 
  
Version 3, October 2024  Page 14 of 22 study visit 2  (with de -identified data ) or it sends the information via wireless radio frequency to 
a monitoring/display device or to a cellular phone so one can see their  own data on their  glucose and we can 
download it remotely. The device automatically generates an alert for glucose < 55, and an alert will also be 
generated for glucose > 140 in the unblinded portion of the study. The i ntervention group participants will be 
given a handout (Appendix K ) for troubleshooting these alerts, particularly during the blinded portion of the 
study. DEXCOM G6 is FDA approved for use in patients with diabetes and will be used in accordance with 
instructions as approved for diabetes. It is not currently approved for patients wi th gestational diabetes but will 
be us ed in accordance with instruc tions as approved for diabetes. The risk is minimal with use of this device.  In 
this study, we recommend patients connect t he CGM  to their cell phones, but if unable/unwilling , we will provide 
transmitters for participants to allow  for real -time monitoring. Stu dy staff will insert the first sensor  for the groups 
and demonstrate how to insert additional sensors for the intervention  group who will continue to use RT-CGM . 
If this is to be done as a televisit, the sensors , transmitter , and device  (if needed)  will be mail to the participant. 
Then  the study staff will walk  the participant  through the first insertion  through a  virtual zoom visit. Pa tients  will 
also have a youTube video available for reference for the patie nts. For the blinded control , the research 
coordinator will insert all sensors  unless tel evisit is needed  with procedure as above.  The patients  will be 
instructed  on how to remove the sensor themselves after [ADDRESS_29504]  RT-CGM download serially over the study during regularly scheduled OB 
visits  or televisits . The control group participants will wear the blinded CGM at beginning , at 30-32 and 34-36 
weeks of the study. If, during the blinded portion of the study, due to device malfunction (rather than subject non-
compliance), the device records less than 3 days of data, the participant can return to restart another 10 days of  
blinded CGM data.   
The receiver and/or the app will display the glucose reading along with a rate of change arrow and a trend 
graph. Additionally, the receiver and/or app issues alarms and alerts to notify the patient of glucose level changes 
and other important system conditions. The app provides the additional c apability to share data with “followers” 
using the Dexcom Share service. The receiver can be put into a blinded mode using CLARITY® software. In this 
mode, users are unable to see the CGM data or receive CGM alerts.  
CGM Ancillary Devices Dexcom CLARITY® is an accessory for users of the Dexcom CGM system. It is 
a software program that allows the transfer of glucose data from the CGM system to Dexcom remote servers for 
data management to allow the use of the CGM data by [CONTACT_30168]. Target ranges of 65 to 140 
mg/dl [3.6 to 7.8 mmol/l] will be set and the patients will be introduced to  the use of alarm settings. Both 
participants and study sites will use CLARITY® to transfer glucose data between user and  study site, whether 
CGM is used in blinded or  real-time mode. A CLARITY® mobile app can be used for a retrospective review of 
glucose data on the smart device and can also be set up to allow receipt of push notifications of CGM data facilitating data review. For all patients (intervention and control group) an anonymized CLARI TY
® account will 
be created by [CONTACT_2329] a sequential study number which is allocated at randomization.  
 
 Intervention  Group :  
- For participants who have  a supported phone, the DEXCOM G6 CGM app will be installed on participant’s 
smart phone.  
- An anonymized CLARITY® mobile account will be set up and linked to the research site.  
- Participants will use CGM data to log their blood sugars for fasting and 1- hour post -meals for review by [CONTACT_30169]. The OB providers will not specifically use the CGM in their management decisions.  
- A high alert threshold will be set at 140 mg/dl [7.8 mmol/l]. Low alert threshold and urgent low soon alerts will 
be turned off. If participants require insulin, the low alert will be turned on and the threshold set at 65 mg/dl [3.6 mmol/l]. In addition , the urgent low alert (55 mg/dl [3.1 mmol/l]), the urgent low soon alert (when glucose levels 
 
  
Version 3, October [ADDRESS_29505] and will be below 55 mg/dl [3.1 mmol/l] in less than 20 min) as well as alerts for rise and fall rate 
(3 mg/dl [0.17 mmol/l]) in addition to alerts for signal loss and no readings for more than [ADDRESS_29506] CLARITY® push notifications on the CLARITY® mobile 
app about weekly time in range comparison enabled during the study.  
- For app users, the “Share and Follow” functionality will be discussed and encouraged (i.e. the study participants 
are able to invite followers to review their glucose levels).  
- For participants using the receiver only, the receiver will be downloaded into the CLARITY® clinic account at 
each visit. CGM data and reports.  RT CGM -Participants will also keep a logbook of their blood sugars for their 
provider to review.  
 
Control G roup  
The participants of the control group will perform self -monitored blood glucose testing with a study-
provided blood glucose meter, including testing supplies. They will perform capi[INVESTIGATOR_30141], i.e., at least four capi[INVESTIGATOR_30142] a fasting state as well as [ADDRESS_29507].  Blood glucose meters used by [CONTACT_30170] (overall and per week) as well as percentage of days with less than four 
meas urements per day.  
 Subjects who got randomized to the control group then decided to withdraw from the study and discontinue their 
participating in the study will receive an email asking them to fill out a survey questionnaire to explain the main reason and any other reasons for withdrawal from the study. The survey will be sent to subjects’  email through a 
link from Redcap  and it won’t take more than 10 minutes to complete.  
 
Glucose  Meter:  A glucometer is a  device for measuring the concentration of glucose in the blood by [CONTACT_1299] a 
small drop of blood on a disposable test strip where a chemical reaction with glucose alters the electrical 
conductivity of the strip. It records glucose and also records average glucose and standard deviation and goal 
range can be set and show time in range.  This is standard of care for patients with gestational diabetes in 
pregnancy to check fasting and  [ADDRESS_29508] -meals.  
 
Gestational DM Nutritional  Classes:  
As per local standard of care, nutritional counseling for G DM is provided to all patients with diagnosis of GDM 
and all participants will be  offered and  asked to complete this  session. Completion of ses sion will be assessed at 
visit 2.  
 
RT-CGM Handout : 
A simple educational handout has been developed to explain glucose goals in pregnancy and also how food and 
activity affects  blood sugars. This handout will be reviewed with RT -CGM participants at visit 0  and adapted to 
fingersticks as well for the control group (see Appendix  A1, A2 )  
 
K .Measurements  (Appendix C): We will measure HbA1c and fructosamine  at the beginning of the study 
period and HbA1C at 30-32 and  HbA1C and fructoasmine at  34-36 weeks . At each visit , blood pressure,  
maternal resting heart rate,  maternal weight and height will be measured. At baseline and 34-36 weeks , 
 
  
Version 3, October 2024  Page 16 of 22 questionnaires on diet and physical activity  and personal wellness  questionnaires will be obtained . In the 
intervention group at 34-36 weeks , a questionnaire about CGM technology and perception of benefit of CGM 
use will be obtained . 
 
Anthropometrics: Heigh t will be recorded in centimeters and inches by a s tadiometer. Weight  will be 
recorded in pounds and kilograms using a  Digital scale . Two measurements will be taken, and the average will 
be used.  Blood pressure and pulse  are taken with an Professional Digital blood pressure machine. Two 
measurements will be obtained at each appointment.  If performed via remote televisit then patients will use 
their own blood pressure cuff and available scale.  
 
 
L.Collection of Human Biological Specimens :  
 
Fingerstick and serum HbA1c and Fructoasmine : The HbA1c test is a blood test that provides information 
about a person’s average levels of blood glucose over the last [ADDRESS_29509] results from 
a finger prick of blood. Serum HbA1c and fructoasmine is sent via LabCorp.  
 
CBC: The complete blood count (CBC) is a test that evaluate the cells that circulate in blood, including red 
blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs).  CBC will be conducted at baseline and 
week 34 -36.  
 
 
M: Questionnaires   
 
Nutrition Questionnaire (Appendix G) :: Starting The Conversation (STC) is an eight -item simplifıed food 
frequency instrument designed and validat ed for use in primary care and  
health -promotion settings  (12). 
 
Physical A ctivity  Questionnaire  (Appendix H ): The International Physical Activity Questionnaire  (short) is a 
validated questionnaire that reviews the last 7 days of activity for middle aged adults (age 15- 69 years) ( 13).  
 
Diabetes Distress Questionnaire  (Appendix O ): Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale 5  
(PAID -5), is a 5 -item validated short form of the PAID -20. The PAID has been used in women with GDM.  
The questionnaire consists of 5 items, scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not a problem) to 4 (a 
serious problem).  Total scores can range from 0 to 20, with higher scores suggesting greater diabetes  related  
distress. A cutoff of 8 or  higher indicates elevated diabetes distress (14-15). 
 
WHO- 5 well -being index  (appendix I)  is a marker of overall welling and has been used to evaluate overall 
health in type 1 and type 2 diabetes (21)  
 
Depressive Symptoms  Questionnaire  (Appendix P ): The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ -9) will be 
used. The PHQ -9 score ranges from 0 to 27: each of the 9 items is scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every 
day), in which higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms  Research has  shown that a cutoff of 12 or 
higher is suitable to identify elevated depressive symptoms in patients with diabetes  (15-18). 
 
 
  
Version 3, October 2024  Page 17 of 22 Perception /Satisfaction with CGM  and Fingersticks/Meter ( Appendices J ): The Harvard Joslin Diabetes

P. Risks and Side Effects:  
 
 There are various possible risks and side effects that a participant may incur as a result of this study.  At 
the beginning of the study, when participants are administered the informed consent form by [CONTACT_3647], they 
will be informed that their participation is completely voluntary and will be informed of the risks and benefits. 
They are free to leave the study at any time and will not be penalized. Potential subjects will also be told that 
failure to participate in no way affects the usual care they would receive from their OB provider. Only after all questions have been answered, both study staff and the  participant will sign and date the consent form.   
 
It is very unlikely that there will be any adverse event s 
 There are possible risks associated with the intervention activities, including the medical device, 
including:  
a. Less Likely (1% ≤ Event Rate < 5%): CGM site  infection or tape allergy (<1 -2%) (41) 
b. Likely (5% ≤ Event Rate < 10%): None  
c. More likely (Event Rate ≥ 10%): None  
 
Risk to Participants:  
There is the possibility of bruising, soreness and infection at the sites of needle sticks for blood draws, finger sticks for 
checking  glucose levels and at the insertion sites of the CGM devi ce. All participants will be provided with an emergency 
number for who to contact [CONTACT_30172].  
 
Continuous Glucose Monitoring Device:  Participants  may have temporary discomfort at the time of inserting 
the small filament. This can include bruising or redness of the skin, rare allergy to tape used to keep the device 
in place, infection at the insertion site, and potential perceived dislike of having a medical device on them  for [ADDRESS_29511] blood sugar which could cause anxiety. Participants will be told to  follow the 
instructions of their provider. Participants will be provided with study contacts for any questions and the study will work 
in conjunction with the participants’ OB provider about blood sugar testing  instructions.  
 There is the risk for participants in RT -CGM in the intervention group missing alerts if the alert notification is turned off.  
 There is the risk of lack of accuracy of the CGM read outs  in the intervention group if the participant takes 
acetaminophen.  
 There is the risk for both groups if during insertion of the CGM the insertion wire breaks and becomes lodged under the 
skin and requires removal.  
 There are some skin issues that can occur when using the CGM devi ce such as allergic reactions to the d evice that are 
localized and can include bruising, rash, soreness, and infection.  This skin reaction can also be caused by  [CONTACT_30173].  
  There is the risk of suicidal ideation presenting itself while answer the PHQ -[ADDRESS_29512] endorses 
suicidal ideation answering the PHQ -9 our plan we be to call the participant immediately and discuss the participant’s 
answer, provide the participant the number for a suicide hotline,  and to call the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_30145]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_30146] 911.  
We will be checking for completion of the questionnaires after links to participants  are sent to them and the PHQ -9 
answers will be checked at that time.  Our time frame for checking the PHQ- 9’s completion is within 3 -5 days after being 
sent out.  Our plan will be put into action if any questions are answered in a manner concerning to our study personnel who will be trained for our action plan and what to watch for within an hour of seeing the answer to the question 
 
Body measurements:  Participants  may experience discomfort or embarrassment associated with weight and 
fundus measurements .           
 
 
 
    
 
Q. Benefits:   
 
Participants may receive some benefit for glucose control in pregnancy with RT -CGM which may or may not 
translate to improved fetal and maternal outcomes. Control patients will likely receive no benefit from blinded CGM and fingersticks [ADDRESS_29513]:  
 No conflicts of interest are noted.  
 
S. Confidentiality:  
 All of the subjects’ personal information, clinical data and consent documents will be stored in a secure 
location in a locked file cabinet in the University of Washington OB  research coordinator’s office. The subjects’ 
personal information and research related clinical data other than routine laboratory results will be accessible only to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_30147]. Organizations that may 
 
  
Version 3, October [ADDRESS_29514] and copy the participant information include the IRB  of the University of Washington. A master code 
linking the unique study numbers with subjects’ identifying information will be kept by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_30148] a locked file cabinet. Additionally,  all data collected by [CONTACT_30174] (REDCap) sy stem 
maintained at University of Washington.  All data is de -identified with no personal health  information entered 
(PHI). REDCap was developed specifically around HIPAA security guidelines. REDCap has been disseminated for local use at more than 940 other academic/non- profit consortium partners in [ADDRESS_29515] -protected documents on HIPAA -compliant servers.  REDCap programmers build in 
quality controls for the data that will be collected according to their stringent protocols. Data will be stored for 3 years after study completion for possible re -analysis and sub- group analysis that the clinical team may 
deter mine to be useful. More information about the consortium and system security can be found 
athttp://www.projectredcap.org. [CONTACT_30177] and her research team will destroy the informed consent, research 
source documents, data  files, and master code [ADDRESS_29516] randomized to the DM C (control) group willl be 
DMC-[ADDRESS_29517] randomized to the DMCGM  (intervention) group will be DM CGM -001. A total 
of [ADDRESS_29518] employment status, lead to ci vil/criminal liability, incur 
financial risks to the study participants, or other risks . 
 
T. Subject Compensation:  
Participants will be given $50 after visit 0 and  $50 after visit  3. Visit 3 compensation will be  given to 
participant upon return of blinded device or RT -CGM download at 34- 36 weeks . If lack of CGM data 
necessitates unscheduled visits, the participant will receive an additional $25 per visit up to a maximum of $[ADDRESS_29519] use  of the  medical devices during the study for free : 
in the intervention group  they will receive a glucose meter and test strips (total [ADDRESS_29520] strips  for free ) to be used 
as needed . In the control group they will receive a glucose meter and [ADDRESS_29521] will be incurred by [CONTACT_1766] .  
If extra visits are necessary we will follow the OB clinic guidelines for COVID 19 screening.  This money 
can be used for travel and parking but all study visits are pi[INVESTIGATOR_30149] a regular clinic visit so no extra travel or parking is required by [CONTACT_30175] a little longer than usual

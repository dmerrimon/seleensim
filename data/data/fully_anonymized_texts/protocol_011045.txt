 Scientific Background  
 
Alzheimer’s disease ( AD) is the most common cause of dementia in adults [ADDRESS_796352] on AD progression.2 The Alzheimer’s Association’s [ADDRESS_796353] in repurposing the use of lithium 
for diseases involving neurodegeneration.4 Lithium treatment has been associated with 
neurogenesis in the hippocampus,5 up-regulation of important neurotrophic factors such as B -cell 
lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2) and brain -derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ),[ADDRESS_796354], 
inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( [COMPANY_004] -3) isoforms α and β. In particular, [COMPANY_004] -3α interacts 
with gamma -secretase playing a critical role in the conversion of amyloid precursor protein ( APP) 
to amyloid -beta (Aβ); lithium has been shown to reduce Aβ production and memory deficits in AD 
transgenic mouse models.[ADDRESS_796355] been mixed .14-17 At this time, it is difficult to draw definitive 
conclusions and make recommendations for widespread use of lithium based on the current 
evidence as well as the unclear risk/benefit profile of lithium treatment in older adults at risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_201314]. R esearch is needed to determine whether lithium has a role as an anti -dementia 
agent. In contrast to previous studies, we will implement an RCT with a more integrative, 
comprehensive approach than done before involving state -of-the-art ultra -high field (7T)  human 
MRI, neurocognitive assessment, and blood -/CSF - based biomarker measurement to investigate 
the role of lithium as an anti -dementia agent.  
 
The rate of conversion to dementia among older adults with mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) is 
15% per year in clinic samples.18 Accordingly, we will enroll older adults who meet criteria for MCI 
in which we will assess whether lithium can alter the AD trajectory.19 Enrolling individuals who 
exhibit no cognitive impairment would be the basis of a different, much larger and longer study 
given the lower rates of AD conversion compared with individuals with MCI. Conversely, enrolling 
individuals with established AD is l ikely too far in the disease process for lithium to make a 
significant difference.

 Study Objectives  
 
Specific Aim: To examine the potential disease modifying properties of lithium in 
individuals with MCI in delaying conversion to dementia.  
 
H1: a) Participants randomized to take lithium for two years, compared to placebo, will better 
maintain cognitive function, primarily in memory, which b) will be associated with changes in 
biomarkers (e.g., [COMPANY_004] -3β activity, BDNF).  
 
H2: a) Participants randomized to take lithium for two years, compared to placebo, will have larger 
hippocampal volumes and lower total gray matter thinning, which b) will be associated with 
changes in biomarkers (e.g., [COMPANY_004] -3β activity, BDNF) and c) better  cognitive function, primarily in 
memory.  
 
Exploratory Aim: To examine whether lithium is related to additional markers of enhanced 
brain integrity (e.g., lower level of microbleeds, higher white matter integrity, better 
network connectivity, or decreased CSF phospho tau levels).

 Study Design  & Methods  
 
Enroll and randomly assign 80 individuals 60 years and older with MCI to take lithium, titrated as 
tolerated to a blood level of 0.6 to 0.8 mEq/L, or placebo for two years to assess lithium’s effects 
on preserving cognition and delaying conversion to demen tia. Participants will receive annual 
neurocognitive assessment, ultra -high field (7T) brain MRI (e.g., high -resolution imaging of 
hippocampal and total cortical gray volumes, white matter integrity, dynamic imaging), blood - 
(e.g., [COMPANY_004] -3β, BDNF, cytokines)  and CSF -based (e.g., Aβ, total tau, and phospho tau) biomarker 
measurement. All subjects will undergo baseline PET imaging of Aβ on which to stratify 
randomization. This study is powered to detect medium/large effect sizes for H1 -2, and will serve 
as the “go/no -go” for a subsequent, larger -scale, confirmatory study .

 Statistical Considerations  
 
HYPOTHESIS TESTING . All statistical analyses will be conducted starting with basic descriptive 
techniques and two sample testing (t -tests, Wilcoxon tests, chi -square tests) for testing the 
difference between the intervention and control groups. Statistical tests will be two -sided and 
interpreted at the 0.[ADDRESS_796356] sizes for all adjusted analysis (p<0.01) due to multiple testing. Additionally, all of 
our voxel -wise analyses results will be corrected  using FWE . These analyses will then inform the 
next step in the analysis process that will include statistical modeling. First,  adherence will be 
assessed over time by [CONTACT_601385] a Kaplan -Meier approach where non -adherence 
is considered to be an "event.” For all modeling, we will use regression diagnostics to identify 
potential outliers or influential observations. Ad ditionally, the analyses will be assessed for the 
impact of missing data. For the initial reporting of all results, we will fol low the guidelines outlined 
in the CONSORT statement  and follow intention to treat principles:  subjects will continue to be 
followed and analyzed according to the original randomized assignment.134, 135 Tests of whether 
missingness is at random will be performed. Should missing data prove to be an issue, we will 
rely on inverse probability weighting or imputation as part of the analysis.  
 
Specific Aim: H1 -2. This analysis focuses on assessing the effect of lithium on: (H1) cognitive 
performance and, (H2) neuroimaging measures of hippocampal volumes and  total gray matter 
and cognition . Outcomes are measured at three time points, and our primary analysis will consist 
of linear mixed effects models. These models will include a term for time, group and a time -by-
group interaction. We will test for lithium effect by [CONTACT_601386] a likelihood ratio test between the 
models with and without interaction. First, we will fit these basic models for each of the outcomes 
of interest and test for the time -by-group interaction as an assessment of the effect of lith ium. 
Second, we will include potential covariates (e.g., age, education, sex, etc.) and exploratory 
covariates (e.g., physical activity) that may influence the group effect and test for a time -by-group 
interaction in this context. We will examine the bioma rker trajectories across the two groups. If 
the assays used to measure the biomarkers produce results outside of the detectable limits, we 
will use tobit model and mixed model extensions of the tobit model to test for differences between 
the two groups.  
 
POWER ANALYSIS . For H1a/H2a, where 80 subjects will be randomized to one of two groups 
with 64 completers (32 in each cell), we computed power based on the following assumptions: a 
two-sided significance level of 0.05, a power of 0.[ADDRESS_796357] 
size (Cohen’s d) of 0.57 (i.e., medium) when the observations are correlated at a level of 0.[ADDRESS_796358] size ranged from 0.54 to 0.72 as the corr elation between repeated observations ranged 
from 0.1 to 0.6.

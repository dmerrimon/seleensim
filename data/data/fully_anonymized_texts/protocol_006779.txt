Rationale and 
background:The treatment of COPD involves multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including long- acting β2 
agonists (LABA) (with and without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-
acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), with combinations of these drugs 
now formulated into single inhalers. 
There are recommendations to restrict triple therapy use further, to only 
patients who are likely to respond to ICS (such as those with asthma -COPD 
overlap or patients with high risk of exacerbations and elevated blood 
eosinophils [P15-[ZIP_CODE], P07 - [ZIP_CODE], R19-3048 ].There is an increasing body 
of evidence suggesting th at ICS areparticularly effective at reducing the
incidence of COPD exacerbations in patients only with a very high blood 
eosinophil concentration , but not in normal levels [P18-[ZIP_CODE]]. Hence t here 
is a clear need for better evidence on specific patient populations upon which 
to base treatment recommendations.
This non- intervent ional study aims to assess the c omparative effectiveness of 
combination Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_140395] (Tio+Olo) (FDC) compared to 
combination LAMA/LABA and ICS (fixed or open) , and to explore whether 
this varies across COPD sub populations defined by [CONTACT_140420]. The 
intended audience sarepayers and prescribers.  The results from the study 
will be published in the scientific literature.

Research question and 
objectives:The goal of this study is to investigate the risk of COPD exacerbations, 
community acquired pneumonia, and health care utilization in patients treated 
with Tio+Olo in comparison to patients treated with ICS/LABA/LAMA. All 
analyses will be repeated in sub-g roups of patients under high -or low risk of 
exacerbation based on (1) previous history of exacerbations in the year 
preceding cohort entry ( with exacerbation history defined as either 1+ 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] 2+ exacerbations in emergency department or outpa tients 
settings [R05-1384]), and (2) circulating eosinophils (cut -off B - Eos 300
cells/uL [P18-[ZIP_CODE]]) Both overall and among those without a history of 
exacerbation.
The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of maintenance therapy 
initiation with the combination treatment Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_140395] 
(Tio+Olo) compared with any LABA/LAMA/ICS combination in COPD as 
the time to the first COPD exacerbation. 
The secondary objective is to assess the association between maintenance 
therapy initiation with the combination treatment (Tio+Olo vs any 
LABA/LAMA/ICS combination in COPD and time to community acquired 
pneumonia.
Additionally, we will a ssess differences between Tio+Olo vs any 
LABA/LAMA/ICS in healthcare utilization and all-cause and COPD -specific
cost overall and by [CONTACT_140421].
Study design: A incident new -user cohort design will be used, with confounding controlled 
via fine stratification and reweighting of time -conditional propensity scores

Population: The cohort will consist of all patients in the HIRD with a diagnosis of COPD 
who received Tio+Olo or combination LABA/LAMA/ICS treatment from 1 
January 20 13until 31 March 2019 (or the most recent date available at the 
time of cohort extraction) . To increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of COPD
and decrease the likelihood of including misdiagnosed asthma patients , we 
will only include patients 40years of age or older on the index date and 
exclude all patients with a diagnosis of asthma within the year prior to the 
index date or lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, or lung transplantation at 
any time prior to the index date.   
Patients will have at least one year of medical history information prior to the 
cohort entry date to allow the identification of new use and the measurement 
of baseline covariates.  Patient s will be followed until switching to the other 
treatment, other changes in therapy, discontinuation of COPD treatment, the 
end of the individual’s health plan eligibility, or the end of the study period, 
whichever occurs first. Main analyses will be limited to the first year 
following the index date.
Additional restriction to individuals who have laboratory test result data 
showing eosinophil levels will occur for relevant sensitivity analyses.

5. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
The treatment of COPD involves multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including Long- acting β2 agonists
(LABA) (with and without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting muscarinic 
antagonists (LAMA), with combinations of these drugs now formulated into single inhalers.
Several trials compared a single -inhaler triple therapy  with an ICS/LABA and a LAMA 
respectivel y and found greater benefit with triple FDC [P19-[ZIP_CODE]]. However, they represent 
a limited view of the patients who could potentially  use these treatments so that a real-world 
study  of patients who are representative of clinical practice is of interest.
There are recommendations to restrict triple therapy  use further, to only patients who are 
likely  to respond to ICS (such as those with asthma -COPD overlap or elevated blood 
eosinophils [P15-[ZIP_CODE] ).There is an increasing body  of evidence suggesting that ICS are
particularl y effective at reducing the incidence of COPD exacerbations in patients only with a
very highblood eosinophil concentration, but not in normal levels [P18-[ZIP_CODE] ]. Hence there 
is a clear need for better evidence on specific patient populations upon which to base 
treatm ent recommendations.
This non-interventional study  aims to assess the comparative effectiveness of combination 
Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_140395] (Tio+Olo) (FDC) compared to combination LAMA/LABA and 
ICS (fixed or open) This study  will provide useful data on the relative benefits of different 
combinations in treating COPD patients The intended audience

The results from the study  will be published in the scientific literature.

6. RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIVES
The goal ofthis study  is to investigate the risk of COPD exacerbations, community  acquired 
pneumonia, and health care utilization in patients treated with Tio+Olo in comparison to 
patients treated with ICS/L ABA/LAMA. All analyses will be conducted for the total 
population, as well asin sub -groups of patients under (1) high-or low risk of exacerbation 
based on previous history  of exacerbations in the year preceding cohort entry  (cut-off: 0-1 vs 
2+ exacerbations [P07-

[P18-[ZIP_CODE]]), and (3) a s an exploratory  analysis, a combination of exacerbation history  and 
circulating eosinophils .
Primary objectives:
The primary  objective is to compare the effectiveness of new use of maintenance therap y 
initiation with the combination treatment Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_140395] (Tio+Olo) compared 
with new use of  LABA/LAMA/ ICS combination in COPD as the time to the first COPD

7. RESEARCH METHODS
7.1 STUDY DESIGN
Population- based incident new- user cohort design.
7.2 SETTING
The study  will be conducted using administrative healthcare claims and laboratory  result data 
captured in the HealthC ore Integrated Research Database (HIRD; details in Section 7.5).
Theobservation period will be from January [ADDRESS_159517] recent date available at the 
time that the cohort is extracted (estimated March 2019).
7.3 SUBJECTS
The study  cohort will be formed based on the following entry  criteria.
Inclusion Criteria:
1. At least one prescription for Tio+Olo or a LABA/ LAMA/ ICS combination between
1Janua ry2013 and31 March 2019.
a.For Tio+Olo users, t he first dispensing of Tio+Olo wil l be defined as the index 
date.
b.LABA/LAMA/ ICS use can occur either in free or fixed combinations. 
Thefirst date when all three medications are used based on either concurrent 
or overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_140397].
2.At least one diagnosis of COPD at any  time prior to the index date.
3. At least one year of continuous medical and pharmacy  health plan eligibility  priorto the 
index date will be required to allow a baseline period for the covariates and identification 
of new use of the study  drugs .
Exclusion Criteria:
1. T o increase the likelihood of a true diagnosi s of COPD, we will exclude :
a.All patients less than 40years of age on the index date, and
b. All patients with a diagnosis of asthma in the y ear prior to the index date
2.To limit the population to those without severe lung compromise outside of COPD, we 
will exclude individuals with lung cancer , interstitial lung disease, or lung transplant 
identified at an y time prior to the index date 
3.To restrict the cohort to new users of Tio+Olo or LABA/ICS, we will exclude any 
individual with use of either Tio+Olo, LABA/I CS, or LABA/LAMA/ICS combination 
therap y in free or fixed form for at least one y ear prior to the index date.
Outpatient laboratory  data is available for a subset of patients. Some analyses will be further 
restricted to the subset of thepopulation with at least one laboratory  result showing 
circulating eosinophil levels within six months before the index date.
Individuals in the study  cohort will be followed from the index date until the earliest of the 
date of a switch in treatment, addition of ICS for the Tio+Olo group , discontinuation of

analyses considering all available data .
7.4 V ARIABLES
7.4.1 Exposures
The exposure measures are based on pharmacy  dispensings of the study  medications, namel y 
Tio+Olo and LABA/LAMA/I CS combination therap y.As described in the data analy sis 
section, theas-treated analy sis, which is the main analy sis,will consider continuing exposure 
of the initial treatment of Tio+Olo or LABA /LAMA /ICSwithin the treated groups defined by 
[CONTACT_140422] y recorded at the time of pharmacy  dispensing, allowing for a gap between 
dispensings of up to 15days.This gap is allowed in consideration of plausible delay s in 
obtaining medication refills and continued use beyond the days supplied where medication 
has been missed due to imperfect adherence , and will be varied in sensitivity  analyses 
(seeSection 7.9.2) .Codes used to identify  study  medications are included in Annex 3.1.
The treatment segment ends at the earliest of the following events:
1.Fifteen days after the end of the observed days supply  for the medication received on the 
index date without a subsequent dispensing of COPD medication (i.e., discontinuation)
2.Initiation of triple therapy  (i.e., addition of ICS to Tio+Olo ora LAMA to LABA/ICS 
(i.e., treatment es calation, applies to Tio+Olo only)
3.Any other change in use of study  medication by [CONTACT_140423], inclusive of a change to 
a different combination therap y, change from a fixed form to a free form combination 
therap y, or a change from combination therap yto monotherap y (i.e., switch)
Changes in dose for medications started on the index date will not impact the end of the 
treatment segment. Codes used to identify  study  medications are included in Annex 3.1.
7.4.2 Outcome (s)
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary outcome(S)
The primary  
outcome event for effectiveness is the first COPD exacerbation to occur after 
cohort entry .The event is defined as follows:
 Severe exacerbation:
oHospi[INVESTIGATOR_18506] a principal discharge diagnosis of COPD.
 Moderate exacerbation:
oAn ED visit wit h a discharge diagnosis of COPD and/or
oDispensing of an antibiotic and an oral corticosteroid on the same day
Time to the first COPD exacerbation will be measured from cohort entry  until the occurrence 
of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140398] (severe exacerbation) or 
ED visit for COPD with the 
prescription of an antibiotic and/or an oral corticosteroid on the same day (moderate 
exacerbation). Severe and moderate exacerbations will be considered as a composite for main 
analyses. Sensitivity  analyses will str atify by [CONTACT_140424] .
Although there is precedent for defining moderate exacerbation based on use of antibiotics 
for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_140399], we have chosen

BI Study Number 1237-0094 c30699487-01
Proprietary confidential information © 2019 Boehringer I ngelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
a more restrictive definition of exacerbation. Because diagnoses listed on outpatient claims 
often correspond to a patient’s past medical history  in addition to acute problems, we expect 
limited ability  to capture the indication for which antibiotics are prescribed. As such, 
including antibiotics alone as a case definition for exacerbation would introduce potentiall y 
substantial misclassification of outcome where antibiotics were truly given for 
non-respi[INVESTIGATOR_121875]. Given that our analyses will yield estimates on a ratio measure, 
non-differentially  reduced sensitivity  is a less important threat to validity than reduction of 
outcome specificity , which produces an expectation of bias towards the null hypothesis. 
Inorder to test our assumptions that the sensitivity  of our outcome definition is not 
differential between the Tio+Olo and LABA/ICS groups, we would produce counts of 
patients with antibiotics alone during follow -up, and determine whether the proportion of 
potential exacerbations that we excluded through 
this design decision is comparable across 
groups.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary outcome(s)
Thesecondary  outcome is the occurrence of the first hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140400] -acquired 
pneumonia (serious pneumonia). Pneumonia will be defined using ICD-9- CM diagnoses 
481.x
-486.x; 487.0, 507.x, 507.0, 507.1, 507.8, 510.0, 510.9, 511.0, 513.0, 514.x, 517.1, 
519.8, 530.84,  and ICD -10 diagnosis codes J10.0; J11.0; J12 -J18; J22; J69; J85.0; J85.1; J86 .
This definition has been used successfully  in COPD [P07-[ZIP_CODE]; P16-[ZIP_CODE] ] .
7.4.3 Covariates
Patient characteristics at baseline will be assessed for Tio+O lo and LABA/L AMA/ICS user 
overall and stratified by [CONTACT_140425], circulating eosinophils, subgroups defined 
by [CONTACT_140426]. 
We will identify  and describe the following demographic characteristics as of the index da te:

 Use of antibiotics for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_140402] (e.g., azithromy cin)
Chronic comorbidities will be defined using diagnoses identified during all available data 
prior to the index date, and will include:
 Cardiovascular disease
 Charlson comorbidity  index
 Diabetes
 Thyroid disease
 Renal failur e
 Autoimmune disease
 Pneumonia
 Obesity *
 Alcohol use disorder *
 Tobacco use or cessation counselling *
 Cancer (excluding basal cell carcinoma)
* We anticipate limited capture of lifestyle variables known to be risk factors and 
potential confounders ,includ ing obesit y, smoking status and excessive alcohol 
consumption. Although we will describe them as identified in the HIRD, bias anal yses 
to examine the extent to which residual confounding may impact results are also 
planned.
Additionally to the covariates defined above, we will use the high-dimensional approach to 
identify  variables entering a time -condit ional propensity  score.

Sub-populations will include patients with high or low circulating eosinophils (B-Eos 
300 cells/uL [ P18-[ZIP_CODE]] as identified based on the labora tory result value that is closest but 
prior to the index date (within 6months). Additional stratification will include previous 
history  of exacerbations in the year preceding cohort entry  (with exacerbation history defined as 
either 1 +hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109]2 +exacerbations in emergency department or outpatients settings ), and 
among those without a history of exacerbation at baseline, based on circulating eosinophil results 
as noted above. However, number of patients with baseline exacerbations and data available 
on B-Eos is very low (see section 7.7) and therefore analysis would not be meaningful and 
will not be performed.
7.[ADDRESS_159519] includes longitudinal medical and pharmacy  claims data from health plan 
members across the [LOCATION_002] (US). Member enrolment , medical care (professional and 
facility  claims), outpatient prescription drug use, outpatient laboratory  test result data, and 
health care utilization may be tracked for health plan members in the database dating back to 
January 2006, and with diagnoses recorded in International Classification of Disease, 
Version 10 (ICD -10) since October, 2015. Laboratory  result data are additionally  available 
for those tests that have been performed using two large, national reference laboratories 
(Quest and LabCorp ) [R14-4278]. The database has been used for the study  of numerous 
diseases, including studies of COPD [R19-2324; R19- 2321; R19- 2323; R19- 2322; 
P15-[ZIP_CODE] ; P14-[ZIP_CODE] ] 
7.[ADDRESS_159520]. In the absence 
of randomization, confounding by [CONTACT_140427]. Controlling by [CONTACT_140428] y 
score should limit this bias, but can control only for measured covariates and may produce 
estimates that are impacted by [CONTACT_140429]. This is of particular importance in the 
case of lifesty le factors that are less critical to insurance billing and thus poorly  captured in 
claims data. Quantitative bias analyses can formally  describe the extent to which these issues 
are present, but bias analy sis parameters are informed by [CONTACT_140430][INVESTIGATOR_1649]. As such, the accuracy  of bias corrected analyses is limited by [CONTACT_140431] [R19-3031].
Second, there is the possibility  of information bias due to misclassification of the outcomes or 
exposure or missing data, especia lly, differential missingness of some data (e.g. eosinophils, 
which may only be measured in sicker patients). The prescriptions dispensed by a pharmacy 
but not taken by [CONTACT_140432]. Pharmacy  dispensing 
data does bring us one step closer to patient use than physician prescribing given that the 
patient has taken the effort to obtain the medication as instructed, however, information such 
as indication can onl y be inferred based on diagnostic patterns .

7.8 DATA MANAGEMENT
All statistical analy sis for the study  will be conducted using SAS version 9.4 or highe r (SAS 
Institute, Cary , NC). All sensitive data pertaining to the study  will be stored on secured 
servers with access only  permitted by  [CONTACT_140434].
A number of Information Security  policies are enforced, audited, and in place at HealthCor e, 
including complex password requirements and encry ption systems. Security mechanisms and 
policies are in place HealthCore's facilities are standard corporate office space. Office space 
is segregated and managed by [CONTACT_140435]. HealthCore areas which contain 
project and study -related documents are only access by [CONTACT_140436]. All non -HealthCore associates must be accompanied by  [CONTACT_140437]. All study  related files are kept in locked cabinets and work areas. 
There are no visible labels or client listings viewable by [CONTACT_140438] . 
Allpasswords and user authentication mechanisms are forced changed at regular intervals 
and there is automatic locking of worksta tions after a short period of time (< 15 minutes).
Data Center space is permitted on an as required basis and monitored by [CONTACT_140439]. 
HealthCore maintains a cumulative record that indicates, for any point in time, the names of 
authorized personnel , their titles, and a description of their access privileges to the Data 
Center. Data access is restricted, monitored, logged, and audited. HealthCore’s computer 
networks have been designed to separate patient or physician identified data from 
de-identifie d or masked data. Network security , firewalls, and password permissions control 
which HealthCore personnel have access to patient or physician identifiers. Unless the study 
protocol calls for patient or phy sician authorization or a waiver of authorization as granted by 
[CONTACT_2717], no research analy st will have access to patient or physician identifiers within 
HealthCore’s computer systems. All research analy sis databases have been de-identified. 
HealthCore’s Data Center is also physically  secured by a controlle d access facility , with only 
authorized personnel having access to network servers, tape libraries and other media that 
contains patient identifiers.
Research analysis files used by [CONTACT_140440]; if such is the case, access will be made after 
receipt of the patient’s or physician’s authorization or IRB waiver of such authorization has 
been granted. It is also HealthCore policy  to provide for secure storage of study  materials, 
including data, reports, and other files after the study  is completed, with a destroy  date 
assigned based on study  requirements. HealthCore reviews data requirements for each study 
to as sure that only  the minimum of patient or phy sician information is obtained to answer the 
research question(s). For those studies where direct patient identifiers are needed for 
additional data collection such as medical chart abstracts, access to informati on will be 
limited to the greatest possible extent within the research team. Both structural and 
contractual safeguards reinforce policies to minimize the risk of breaching patient or 
physician privacy . The structural safeguards include a clearl y defined data flow process. 
This process minimizes the risk of individual identifiers being improperl y used or disclosed. 
The contractual safeguards include contractual binding to confidentiality  of individuals 
involved in the research.

7.9 DATA ANALYSIS
7.9.1 Main analysis
All analy ses will be prese nted for each group (Tio+Olo vs LABA/LAMA/I CS) overall and 
stratified as follows:
 History  of exacerbation: 0 inpatient and 0 -1 outpatient events
 History  of exacerbation: 1 + inpatient or 2 + outpatient events
 Circulating eosinophils: B -Eos < 300 ug/mL 
 Circulating eosinophils: B -Eos 300 ug/mL+
 History  of exacerbation: 0 inpatient and 0 -1 outpatient events & circulating 
eosinophils: B -
Eos < 300 ug/mL
 History  of exacerbation: 0 inpatient and 0 -1 outpatient events & circulating 
eosinophils: B -
Eos 300 ug/mL +
We will first describe formation of the study  cohort. Patient characteristics at baseline in 
patients treated with Tio+Olo and patients treated with LABA/LAMA/ICS will be described 
using standard descriptive statistics. B ecause eosinophil levels may vary based on 
exacerbation, we will also provide a count and percentage of the number of individuals 
whose eosinophil results were recorded within 30 days of an exacerbation event.
High -dimensional propensity  scores including both pre-specified and data-derived variables 
will then be calculated. We will use fine stratification and reweighting of the exposure 
propensity  score to control for measured covariates [R19-3030]. Balance of patient 
characteri stics between the cohorts will be described before and after propensity  score 
application and compared using standardized differences (in the crude population and the 
reweighted pseudo -population). Standardized differences greater than 0.10 (10%) will be 
taken to indicate imbalance and further refinement approaches will be applied.
For the analy sis of the primary  objective , a Cox proportional hazard regression model will be 
used to perform an as-treated analysis that assesses the effect of current use of 
LABA -LAMA -ICScombination versus the Tio+Olo combination on the risk of a first COPD 
exacerbation . It will provide an estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) of a COPD exacerbation
associated with LABA-LAMA -ICSuse relative to Tio+Olo use, along with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI). Current use will be defined based on the days suppl y during the period of 
overlap, allowing a grace period of 15days following the end of days supply  to account for 
intermittent use. This approach allows consideration of exposure as time-dependent, 
accounting for the changes in exposure during the follow -up.  In particular, this analy sis 
excludes patients stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_140403].
Stratified anal yses will use the same approach. Because not all individuals will have available 
laboratory  result data available, fine stratification and reweighting by  [CONTACT_140441]. Potential effect -modification by B-Eosinophils and/or 
exacerbation history  will be studied by [CONTACT_140442]-specific estimates.

medications used, and pharmacy  costs. Utilization and costs will be stratified to facilitate 
comparison between Tio+Olo and LABA/ICS, and presented by [CONTACT_140443]. All

7.10 QUALITY CONTROL
HealthCore operates observational research studies with the goal that the services provided to 
our clients are of high quality . To support this imperative we believe it is critical 1) to have 
dedicated training and quality  resources and 2) that all talking points and major processes to 
be implemented with the study  be approved b y Boehringer Ingelheim in advance.
HealthCore’s quality  control program is centralized within the Regulatory  Compliance 
Office. The Regulatory  Compliance Office Manager is responsible for quality  control and 
reports directl yto the Vice President of Operations of HealthCore on all quality matters. 
Heal thCore’s quality  system is organized around the Qualit y Manual, the quality  checks 
withinthe project life cycle, and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) . HealthCore has 
procedures for retention of protected health inform ation (PHI) and project data. The study 
will be tracked at various levels to help ensure that all aspects including project delivery , 
infrastructure, qualit y processes, resou rce management, and financial issues are addressed. 
Tohelp ensure the highest level of quality  on every  project, HealthCore has established 
several lay ers of quality  assurance throughout the project lifecy cle.
Role Based Control Checks: Each member of the team is responsible to perform thorough 
quality  control checks on their work. In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_140404]. 
Quality  Check Points: Centralized “checkpoints” have been implemented during the data 
management cy cle to help ensure accurate translation of programming requests.
Quality  Assurance Standards: Standard review procedures have been developed and are 
applied throughout the project lifecy cle.

Automation: HealthCore has developed standard definitions of many  variables and disease 
states and developed programs to apply  these standards as ne eded on projects. These 
standards help ensure consistency , repeatability  and accuracy  for each project.

poorly  captured in claims data. Quantitative bias analyses can formall y describe the extent to 
which these issues are present, but bias analysis parameters are informed by [CONTACT_140444][INVESTIGATOR_1649]. As such, the accuracy  of bias corrected analy ses is limited by [CONTACT_140445].  
Second, there is the possibility  of information bias due to misclassification of the outcomes or 
exposure or missing data, especiall y, differential missingness of some data (e.g. eosinophils, 
which may only be measured in sicker patients). The prescriptions dispensed by a pharmacy

patient has taken the effort to obtain the medication as instructed, however, information such 
as indication can onl y be inferred based on diagnostic patterns.

8. PROTEC TION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
HealthCore maintains Data Sharing Agreements (DSAs) and Business Associate Agreements 
with covered entities that provide protected health information (PHI) incorporated into the 
HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD). HealthCore’s access, use, and disclosure 
of PHI are in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability  and Accountability  Act 
(HIPAA) Privacy  Rule [45CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164]. HealthCore 
does not access, use, or disclose PHI other than as permitted by [CONTACT_140446]. When using PHI for research, this ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y means we will use PHI to 
create limited data sets for research, or when that is not feasible we may obtain a specific 
waiver of the HIPAA authorization requirements from an Institutional Review Board (IRB). 
HealthCore also takes into consideration other federal and state laws and regulations that 
might limit use of certain types of data more than HIPAA, including those laws related to 
identifiable records related to substance abuse and human immunodeficiency  virus.
The current stud y is designed as an analy sis based on medical and pharmacy  claims data from 
a large insured population in the [LOCATION_002] (US). There is no active enrollment or active 
follow -up of study  subjects, and no data will be colle cted direct ly from individuals.
At 
no time during the conduct of this study  will HealthCore provide patient or provider 
identify ing information to Boehringer Ingelheim All data and/or results will be in an 
aggregated and de-identified format. Data variables with values ≤ 10 will be reported only as 
“≤10.” Boehringer Ingelheim will not attempt to re-identify  any results provided for the 
study .

9. MANAGEMENT AND REPOR TING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS/ADVERSE REACT ION S
Data is anon ymized and extracted, anal yzed, valid ated and report ed in aggregate.
There is no potential that any employ ee of BI or agent working on behalf of BI will access 
individual patient data in which the patient may be identified during data compi[INVESTIGATOR_344], data 
reporting or data anal ysis.
Based on current guidelin es from the International Society  for Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_623]  
[R11-4318] and the EMA [R13-1970 ],non-interventional studies such as the one described in 
this protocol, conducted using health care records, do not require expedited reporting of 
suspected adverse events/reactions. Specifically , as stated in section VI.C.1.2.1 of Guideline 
on Good Pharma covigilance Practices (GVP), Module VI–Management and Reporting of 
Adverse Reactions to Medicinal Products, for non-interventional study  designs, which are 
based on use of secondary  data, reporting of adverse reactions is not required.

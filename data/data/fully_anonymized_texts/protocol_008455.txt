1.1 Study Objectives  
OBJECTIVE1. Partnering with 8 -12 PA public high schools (letters of commitment obtained) serving an estimated 
9,650 predominantly minority, rural and/or low socioeconomic status ( SES) students,  we will conduct a 
randomized controlled trial, with student randomization by [CONTACT_479], to compare the effectiveness of universal 
school -based screening for adolescent major depressive disorder ( MDD ) versus the existing process  of targeted 
screening based on concerning behavior.  
 Hypothesis 1: Universal screening will increase the number of adolescents with MDD  screened, 
identified  and engaged in treatment (MDD composite).  
 Hypothesis 2 (Moderating): Universal screening will incre ase MDD screening, identification and 
treatment engagement for minorities.  
 Hypothesis 3 (Moderating): Universal screening will increase the historically poorer rates of  
MDD  screening,  identification and treatment engagement for females  
OBJECTIVE 2. Analyz e the impact of MDD screening on secondary outcomes currently collected by  [CONTACT_52721]’s 
Student Assistance Program  (SAP) and the school district.  These data will be obtained in aggregate by [CONTACT_367644] (a total of 32 data point s for each item; 4 grades x 8 schools).  
 Hypothesis 1. Rates of missed schools days will improve in school populations with universal MDD 
screening secondary to earlier identification, treatment referral and engagement.  
 Hypothesis 2. Grade point averages (G PA) will be improved among school populations with the  
universal MDD screening approach.  
 Hypothesis 3. Rates of grade advancement/graduation will be improved among school populations 
with the universal MDD screening approach.  
 Hypothesis 4. Student school p olicy violations and suspensions will remain unchanged among  
school populations with the universal MDD screening approa ch. 
 
1.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
MDD  composite which includes MDD  screen  positive for the universal screening arm  (or concern  in the 
targeted  screening group ),MDD identification, and MDD treatment  engagement . Each of the primary 
study endpoints will be collected at the individual level by [CONTACT_367645]. No identifiable information will be collected by [CONTACT_3449] s taff.

Addi tional  data points to be obtained for grades 9 -12 include:  
 At the individual level, the following m oderator variables  will be collected  (each 
obtained from the school districts) :  
o Ethnicity - Hispanic vs. non -Hispanic  
o Race - white, black or other  
o Sex - male or female  
 At the aggregate level, the following m ediator variables  will be collected : 
o District socioeconomic status - dichotomized into <50% vs. >50% based on data 
from PA School Performance Profile  
o Urban vs. rural – school districts will be categorized  as urban vs. rural based on 
the definition applied by [CONTACT_367646], a Legislative Agency of the PA 
General Assembly  
o School size – school enrollment will be included as a continuous variable. Data 
will be obtained from school districts based on enrollment as of October [ADDRESS_459624]  
o Ratio of guidance counselors/students – The ratio of counselors to students will 
be obtained from each school district  
o School -based mental health services – schools will be categorized by [CONTACT_367647] -based mental health services (yes vs. no) based on 
information obtained from each school district.  
 
We need to collect data at the individual level for [ADDRESS_459625] 
approximately 20% of students to opt out from the study, with opt out ra tes varying by [CONTACT_479].  
Aggregate data would necessarily include outcomes for students who are not enrolled in the 
study.  This is particularly problematic for the universal screening group because students who 
opt out will not be offered the depression scr eening tool (PHQ -9).  Second, we need to obtain 
gender and race/ethnicity to conduct important planned secondary analyses (subgroup 
analyses) that will examine efficacy of universal screening by [CONTACT_367648].  In particular, we 
expect that females and mino rity students will have much higher rates of major depression 
disorder identified in the universal screening group.  Third, in the universal screening group, we 
will be able to link responses to the PHQ -9 to outcomes, which will allow for estimation of 
important measures such as the false positive rate of the PHQ -9 (score ≥11, but SAP process 
determines no further referrals are needed).  These measures will inform decision -making 
regarding the potential for implementation of the intervention (in other schoo ls) should the 
results of the trial ultimately show efficacy.   
 
2.0 Background   
 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps  
The prevalence of annual major depressive disorder (MDD) epi[INVESTIGATOR_367632] 
8.3% in 2008 to 12.5% in 2015.1 Close to 30% of ad olescents  with MDD reported suicidality in the prior 
year, with more than one in ten making a suicide  attempt.2 As a result, suicide was the 2nd leading 
cause of death among youth 10 -24 years of age  as of 2014.3 Baseline data from HealthyPeople.gov 
found t hat only 2.1% of adolescent primary care  office visits included depression screening in the years 
2005 -2007.4 Additionally, Zenlea et al’s  work found primary care adolescent MDD screening was 80% 
less likely for Hispanic compared  to non -Hispanic white adol escents.[ADDRESS_459626] MDD, but less likely to be treated than males.1,2,6 In 
response to the  growing mental health crisis, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) endorsed  
 
Page 5 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  univ ersal screening for adolescent MDD in primary care in 2009.7,8 The HealthyPeople.gov 2020  goal is a 
10% increase in screening to a rate of 2.3%, which fails to address this adolescent  
public health crisis.[ADDRESS_459627] experts in family medicine,  
pediatrics, psychology and child psychiatry agree that surveillance of adolescents at high -risk for  
MDD is warranted, the USPSTF upd ated their recommendations in 2016 with a call to address  
several knowledge gaps:  
1) Does screening increase the proportion of adolescents identified with MDD?  
2) What are the benefits and unintended consequences of MDD screening for subgroups:  
age, sex, r ace, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES)?  
3) What are the benefits and unintended consequences of screening in nonclinical settings?[ADDRESS_459628] academic 
success (e.g. vision, hearing). However, while  current school screenings address multiple physical health 
domains, none address mental  health.10 Targeted mental health screening is the current school process 
for students who  display  signs concerning for MDD and results in referral to the school’s Student 
Assistance Program  (SAP). SAP operates in all [ADDRESS_459629], from April -Sept 2016 we 
conducted eight focus groups (7 -10 participants each, n=62) to  better understand the perspective of key 
stakeholders regarding Whole Child Health, specifically  the importance of both physical and mental 
wellness. These focus groups included 2 parent  groups, 2 school nurse groups, 2 groups of school 
teachers and administrators and 2 groups of  medical providers (pediatrics and family medicine).  The 
work was funded by [CONTACT_367649] -Children, Youth and Families 
Consortium. Participant  conversations were instrumental in shapi[INVESTIGATOR_367633].  In addition, 
following the aforementioned focus groups, we conduc ted a Community  Engagement Studio in August 
2017 funded by [CONTACT_367650]. These 2 hour sessions are 
specifically intended to inform grant proposals that depend  upon successful community engagement. 
Participant pe rspectives ranged from adolescent to  parent, school staff, the leaders of two mental 
health and suicide prevention organizations  (Aevidum and the Jana Marie Foundation), a Behavioral 
Health Managed Care company  representative and the project director of Pe nnsylvania’s Garrett Lee 
Smith Youth Suicide  Prevention Grant in addition to our Penn State Research team.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_459630] recent data indicates that 1 in 8 adolescents (12.5%)  experienced an MDD epi[INVESTIGATOR_367634] [ADDRESS_459631]  striking increase  in MDD trends  was for females  across all 
racial  and ethnic groups.  Adolescent  females  demonstrated rates  of MDD epi[INVESTIGATOR_367635] 3 times that  of 
males (19.5%  vs. 5.8%).1,[ADDRESS_459632] increased  
exposure to depression  risk factors including cyberbullying, mobile phone use and texting.6 Along with 
 
Page 6 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  the rise in MDD  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], adolescent females have demonstrated a significant rise in emergency 
department visits  for nonfatal self -inflicted injuries with rates since 2009 increasing by 19% annually 
from [ADDRESS_459633] 40 years  according to 
2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.13,14 
Adolescent MDD has negative effects on academic performance, with increasing severity  of depressive 
symptoms linked to a lower grade  point average as well as subjective assessments  of increased school 
workload and concentration difficulties. Adolescents with untreated  MDD experience poorer 
interpersonal relationships, lower self -esteem, social isolation, and  increased risk -taking behav iors 
including substance use, as well as multiple physical and mental  health comorbidities in adulthood.7,8,15-
17 For 60 -90% of adolescents, symptoms of a MDD  epi[INVESTIGATOR_367636] a year. The larger 
problem is that 50 -75% of these adolescents will  develop subsequent MDD epi[INVESTIGATOR_42988] [ADDRESS_459634] individuals  reporting residual symptoms or impairment.18 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_367637], there has been no change in mental health  treatment among 
adolescents with a MDD epi[INVESTIGATOR_367638] 2005 -2014.6 Only 36 -44% of children  and adolescents with MDD 
receive treatment, underscoring that MDD is underdiagnosed and  undertreated.[ADDRESS_459635] a  primary care provider, data from HealthyPeople.gov indicates a steady decline in rates of  
screening with only 1.4% of primary care office visits including MDD screening as of 200 9- 
2011.4 In addition to minorities, rural youth and those of lower SES receive fewer preventive  
care services than their white, urban, high SES counterparts, further limiting their access to  
MDD screening in the context of well -care.20,21

represent a large number of minorities, low SES and/or rural student populations who have known 
disparities in mental health services.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_459638], we will pursue 
opt-out consent for screening given the importance of MDD screening and the low -risk aside from 
identification of a suicidal student. Parents will be informed of their child’s enrollment in screening and 
given the o pportunity to opt out prior to the fall intervention.  For this proposal, in cases of a shared 
custody agreement, if either parent or guardian opts out of the study, the student will be considered 
ineligible for enrollment. In this case, no information will  be collected, even in the case of students 
randomized to the targeted screening arm, which is the usual school process. Also, any participating 
student randomized to the universal screening arm who does not assent at the time of screening will not  
be requ ired to complete the screening form . Students [ADDRESS_459639] the opportunity to opt 
out of study involvement if desired.  
 
4.3 Recruitment mate rials  
No recruitment materials will be needed for this study. However, a letter will be sent home to parents to 
inform them of their child’s enrollment in the screening and given the opportunity to opt out prior to 
the intervention.  If they do not wish to participate, p arents will be asked t o return the Opt -Out form  in-
person or by [CONTACT_2319]. Opt -out letters will be printed on district letterhead to include the participating 
school’s mailing address.  Parents may also return the form signed and scanned, if the sc hool decides to 
send the letter via email.  A copy of the PHQ -9 questionnaire will be included in the letter sent to the 
parents.  Additionally, the opt -out letter will be tra nslated into a Spanish  by [CONTACT_367651].

and engage the parents and communities we are working with. The opt out will be a letter sent 
home to parents (either via email  or regular mail as per school preference) giving them the 
option to decline participation for their student. School s will be responsible for tracking students 
whose parents have opted -out. In addition, students in the universal arm will have the option to  
decline participation themselves on the screening day via the iPad handed to them. The fi rst 
screen will describe PHQ -9; inform students that participation is  voluntary ; and participation 
may be stopped at any time and will not affect their school standin g or grades.

Students in the universal arm will have the option to declin e participation themselves 
on the screening day via the iPad handed to them. The first screen will describe PHQ -9; 
inform students that participation is voluntary; and participation may be stopped at 
any time and will not affect  their school standing . The completion of the PHQ -9 implies 
a student’s voluntary consent to participate in the research. Students who decide not 
to participate will not complete the PHQ -9, but will still be tracked similar to students  
randomized to the targeted screening arm. The st udy team will obtain their 
demographic information and the student will b e followed through the academic year 
for SAP triage intakes initiated by [CONTACT_367652] (concern by [CONTACT_144823], nurse, 
parent, peer, or self -referral), any referrals and treatment  engagement.  No identifiable 
information will be obtained and it will be noted in study records that the student did 
not assent to participate in the MDD screener. A copy of this assent  form is included in

7.0 Study Design and Procedure s 
 
7.1 Study Design  
Due to the timeline for this funding opportunity, with an anticipated July 2018 start, 4 schools will 
engage in the randomized control trial (RCT) in study year [ADDRESS_459641] 4 participating schools . 
 
7.2 Study P rocedures  
 
7.2.1 Enrollment  
Parents will be informed of their child’s enrollment in screening and given the opportunity to opt  
out prior to the fall intervention. The opt out will be a letter sent home to parents (either  via email or 
regular mail as per school preference) giving them the option to decline participation for their student.  
The study team will provide each school with unique study ID s to be assigned  to every student, grades [ADDRESS_459642] (spreadsheet 
template) ensuring that all students, grades [ADDRESS_459643] will include 
student names (first and last), PASECURED ID, unique study ID and demographics information (grade, 
age, sex, race and ethnicity). School s will remove student name s and PASECUREID before sending  the 
spreadsheet to the study team. The full linking list (including student name [CONTACT_367687]) will 
remain on the school’s spreadsheet and in the school’s possession for tracking of study outcom es 
through the year . By [CONTACT_2329] a unique study ID for each student, the study team will never receive 
identifiable information of students. If a parent returns the opt -out form, school staff will still assign a 
student a unique study ID but no demographic in formation will be included. This is so the study team 
may properly report the number of opt -out letters returned. This procedure ensures that students 
whose parents have opted -out are not tracked throughout the year.  
 
At the time of the actual universal screening students will also be provided the chance to opt out by 
[CONTACT_367653] . We anticipate this will lead to study 
enrollment of 80% of eligible  students.  The first screen will describe PHQ -9 and that p roceeding is 
voluntary. The completion of the PHQ -9 implies a student’s voluntary consent to participate in the 
research . Unless the parent opt out is returned, p articipants in both arms will be followed through the 
school year for SAP triage, follow -up re ferrals and treatment engagement.  Those students in the 
universal screening arm with PHQ -9 scores > 11 (MDD screen positive) corresponding to moderate 
depressive symptoms, will proceed through the standard process for anyone referred by [CONTACT_367654] t o a SAP triage interview. The student will either be referred to appropriate community or 
 
Page 11 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  school -based treatment or SAP will determine no follow -up is needed. For those who are recommended 
to additional services by [CONTACT_367655], treatment engagement will be tracked  per current SAP processes. The 
study team will receive individual leve l outcome data  from the school district, containing no identifiable 
information.  
 
7.2.2 Randomization  
We will randomize by [CONTACT_367656] -time universal  screening (via 
PHQ -9) or targeted screening (current SAP process). For the 8 schools included in the study, 4 schools 
(50%) will be randomized such that students in 9th and 11th grades will receive universal screening and 
students in 10th and 12th grades will receive targeted screening, and 4 schools (50%) will be 
randomized such that students in 9th and 11th grades will receive targeted screening and students in 
10th and 12th grades will receive universal screening. Randomization will be done only for stu dents 
whose parents do not signal an unwillingness to participate in the study (“opt out”). Students and study 
personnel will not be blinded to randomized group at each school site. Randomization will be done by 
[CONTACT_367657] -based screenings are grade -specific 
(e.g. hearing screen in 11th grade) and screenings for a grade occur at the same time. The study will be 
conducted within schools, but it is not a cluster randomized study, in which an entire schoo l (cluster) is 
assigned to one of the study groups. A cluster randomized study was considered but ultimately not 
pursued because randomization within schools controls for (1) within -school (community) factors that 
may contribute to higher or lower rates of  SAP referral, (2) differences in school sizes, and (3) potential 
differences in rates of parental opt out among schools. These benefits were balanced against the 
concern of potential contamination between study groups, whereby [CONTACT_367658] -wide push to conduct universal screening.  
 
7.2.3 Universal MDD Screening Arm (Intervention – Treatment)  
Students randomized to the universal screening arm will complete a PHQ -9. This screening tool includes 
nine close -ended  questions with a scoring system ranging from [ADDRESS_459644] completed the PHQ -9 screen the REDCap survey will prompt  them to hand 
the completed questionnaire to study staff, who will see a screen indicating a positive flag. Students 
with suicidal intent (question #9 any response besides “Not at all”) will receive immediate evaluation 
and referral to emergency care as per current school protocols. PA schools are required  to have a plan 
to address suicidal students (Act 71). A suicidal participant identified during the screenin g would not be 
allowed to leave  the screening area unless accompanied by [CONTACT_367659]. This 
student would then proceed throu gh the standard school pathway for managing a student with 
intentions of self -harm. To ensure school staff is comfortable t o manage a student in crisis and that this 
persists beyond the period of the grant, at least [ADDRESS_459645] 4 Penn State 
research staff will complete online evidence -based suicide prevention training (Question, Persuade, and 
Refer [QPR] Suicide Triage Training). In addition, all school crisis plans will be carefully reviewed with 
staff following the training to ensure the steps are realistic and staff is comfortable to execute the plan. 
 
Page 12 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  The district identified, QPR trained staff member will be available at the time of screening. Study staff 
who are also QPR trained, will be present during the screening.  
 
7.2.4 Targ eted Screening Arm (Current Process – Control)  
Students randomized to the targeted screening arm will complete their routine school -based screenings. 
Students will be followed through the academic year for SAP triage intakes initiated by [CONTACT_367660] (concern by [CONTACT_144823], nurse, parent, peer, or self -referral), any referrals and treatment 
engagement.  
 
7.2.5 Sharing Screening Results  
At 14 years of age, PA youth are eligible to consent to mental health services without parental consent, 
therefore, screenin g results will not be shared with parents. Those students  with scores  > 11 (MDD 
screen positive) corresponding to  moderate depressive symptoms will , however , proceed  through the 
standard process for anyone  referred by [CONTACT_367661] a SAP triage inte rview. The student will 
either refer to  appropriate community or school -based treatment or therapy (MDD identified) or SAP 
will determine no follow -up is ne eded. For those who are recommended  to additional services by [CONTACT_367655], 
treatment engagement will be trac ked per current SAP process.  As per current school policy, s tudents 
with suicidal feelings will receive immediate referral to emergency care  and parents will be notified by 
[CONTACT_52721] . 
 
 
7.3 Duration of Participation  
The student’s participation is limited to t he [ADDRESS_459646] an estimated total enrollment of approximately 9650 
students. The overall rate of parental opt out is expected to be around 20%, resulting in approximately 
7720 students included in the study. We assumed a 15% attrition rate for students who move, drop out 
of school, or opt out later in the school year. Thus, the study is expected to  include 6550 students.  
 
8.2 Sample size determination  
A total of 3275 students in each randomized group (an overall sample size of 6550) yields >99% 
statistical power to detect a difference of 3% versus 6% using a [ADDRESS_459647] conducted at a Type I error 
rate of 5% in a mixed effect logistic regression model.  
 
8.3 Statistical methods  
The principles of intention -to-treat (ITT) will be used for all statistical analyses related to primary and 
secondary aims. For the primary aim comparing universal to targeted screeni ng, the statistical analysis 
will be conducted using a mixed effects logistic regression model. The  primary  outcome , MDD 
composite,  will be an indicator whether a student was  screen positive (or concerns raised in the 
targeted screening arm),  identified as  having MDD and subsequently engaged in treatment (1=yes, 
0=no). The model will include a fixed effect for randomized group (0=targeted screening, 1=universal 
screening) and a random effect for school. The random effect accounts for correlation among stude nts 
enrolled within the same school. The primary parameter of interest will be the log odds of MDD 
composite in the universal screening group compared to the targeted screening group. Statistical 
significance of the log odds will be assessed using a [ADDRESS_459648]. Point estimates for the odds ratio 
along with a 95%  confidence interval will be reported.  
 
Page 13 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)   
For the analysis of Hypotheses 2 and 3 (Objective 1) evaluating universal screening and targeted 
screening by [CONTACT_367662], the same mixed effects  logistic regression modeling framework will be 
used, but the model will be extended by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a fixed effect for subgroup and an interaction effect 
for subgroup by [CONTACT_196880]. The interaction term will be the parameter of interest. A significant 
interaction term indicates that rates of MDD treatment engagement for universal versus targeted 
screening differ by [CONTACT_367663] (e.g. female vs. male). For the analysis of Hypotheses 1 through 4 
(Objective 2) that evaluates universal screening and targe ted screening based on school SAP data, we 
will have only 32 total data  points (4 grades in each of 8 schools). Mixed -effects linear (continuous 
outcomes) and logistic regression (binary outcomes) will be used, as appropriate, with a fixed effect for 
rando mized group and a random effect for school. The parameter of interest will be the log odds for the 
universal compared to the targeted screening group. Due to the smaller sample size used for these 
outcomes, these analyses will be considered to be primarily  hypothesis -generating. P otential mediating 
variables (socioeconomic status , rural vs. urban location, school size, ratio of guidance counselors to 
students and availability of school -based mental health services) will be evaluated for both the Objective 
1 and 2 hypotheses.  
 
Additional secondary outcomes will include MDD screen results, MDD concern prompting Student 
Assistance Program triage, MDD identification and MDD treatment engagement analyzed individually 
(rather than as part of MDD composite) . Finall y any s uicidal adolescent s (suicidal thoughts [positive 
response to PHQ -9 item 9], attempts and completed)  will be analyzed as a secondary outcome.  
 
We need to collect data for individuals for [ADDRESS_459649] approximately 20% of 
students  to opt out from the study, with opt out rates varying by [CONTACT_479].  Aggregate data would 
necessarily include outcomes for students who are not enrolled in the study.  This is particularly 
problematic for the universal screening group because students who opt  out will not be offered the 
depression screening tool (PHQ -9).  Second, we need to obtain gender and race/ethnicity to conduct 
important planned secondary analyses (subgroup analyses) that will examine efficacy of universal 
screening by [CONTACT_367648].  In particular, we expect that females and minority students will have much 
higher rates of major depression disorder identified in the universal screening group.  Third, in the 
universal screening group, we will be able to link responses to the PHQ -9 to outco mes, which will allow 
for estimation of important measures such as the false positive rate of the PHQ -9 (score ≥11, but SAP 
process determines no further referrals are needed).  These measures will inform decision -making 
regarding the potential for impleme ntation of the intervention (in other schools) should the results of 
the trial ultimately show efficacy.   
 
Efforts will be made to ensure completeness of data where possible, but missing data will occur for a 
number of anticipated reasons. First, a studen t may move during the course of the school year to 
another school district or drop out from school entirely. No data will be collected after this time point. 
Second, parents may opt out their child from the study at any time during the school year. Third, 
students who turn [ADDRESS_459650] data forms 
incomplete, including the PHQ -9. To decrease these instances, the PHQ -9 will be taken on an iPad 
program and the survey will alert if the form is left incomplete.

11.[ADDRESS_459651] cannot be overstated. MD D is a prevalent, 
disabling and a growing US public health problem. The problem is identified by [CONTACT_367664]’s health care priorities (Healthy People 2020, US Department of Health and 
Human Services). MDD leads both to fun ctional impairment and higher rates of morbidity and mortality. 
In addition, MDD leads to significant social and economic consequences, including increased use of 
health resources and lost work productivity. A public health goal should include identificati on of those at 
risk for depression with the delivery of interventions to these individuals. Schools are a point of 
intervention with a high potential for early identification and prevention. Currently, fewer than [ADDRESS_459652] Stipend (Compensation) and/or Travel Rei mbursements

Page 21 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  1.0 Objectives  
 
1.1 Study Objectives  
OBJECTIVE1. Partnering with 14 PA public high schools (lette rs of commitment obtained  for all 14 high schools ) 
serving an estimated 12,582 predominantly minority, rural , urban, and/or low socioeconomic status (SES) 
students, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial, with student randomization by [CONTACT_479], to comp are the 
effectiveness of universal school -based screening for adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD) versus the 
existing process of targeted screening based on concerning behavior.  
 Hypothesis 1: Universal screening will increase the number of adolescen ts with MDD screened, 
identified and engaged in treatment (MDD composite).  
 Hypothesis 2 (Moderating): Universal screening will increase the historically poorer rates of  
MDD screening, identification and treatment engagement for females  
 Hypothesis 3 (Moder ating): Universal screening will increase the historically poorer rates of MDD 
screening, identification and treatment engagement for rural adolescents  
OBJECTIVE 2. Analyze the impact of MDD screening on secondary outcomes currently collected by [CONTACT_52721] ’s 
Student Assistance Program (SAP) and the school district.  These data will be obtained in aggregate by [CONTACT_367644] (a total of 64 data points for each item; 4 grades x 14 schools , see note below re: 
PCORI ). Please note, secon dary outcomes may no longer be available due to COVID -19 school closures and 
cancellation of state standardized testing.  
 
 Hypothesis 1. Standardized test scores (e.g. Keystone exams, PSAT, SAT, ACT) will improve in school 
populations with universal MDD scr eening secondary to earlier identification, treatment referral and 
engagement.  
 Hypothesis 2. Student school policy violations and suspensions will remain unchanged among  
school populations with the universal MDD screening approa ch. 
 
Please note: We recentl y received funding from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute 
(PCORI) for a complementary project to the one above. Aims for this HRSA study and the PCORI study 
have been adjusted with the permission of both organizations to be complementary but  distinct. The 
PCORI project is in contract negotiations but will involve only urban school districts focusing on the 
effectiveness of MDD screening in minority populations (deleted objective #1, hypothesis #2 above) 
HRSA will remain focused on rural schoo ls, which are primarily white (hence the rationale for removing 
objective #1, hypothesis #2). Secondary outcomes have similarly been adjusted to be complementary 
but distinct from each other. The study will be registered as one RCT in clinical trials.gov a gain with the 
approval of the funding organizations. The final analysis will involve both the HRSA and PCORI funded 
schools.  
 
1.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
MDD composite which includes MDD screen positive for the universal screening arm (or concern in the 
targe ted screening group),  MDD identification, and MDD treatment  engagement . Each of the primary 
study endpoints will be collected at the individual level by [CONTACT_367645]. No identifiable information will be collected by [CONTACT_367667].  
 
Universal Group  
1) Adolescents with PHQ -9 score >11 (screen Sept -March  of the school year) or who at any point in 
the year exhibit behavior concerning for MDD prompting a SAP triage request, 2) Adolescents 
identified with MDD by [CONTACT_367668], and 3)  Adolescents who successfully engage with at least one 
SAP recommendation  
 
Targeted  Group  
 
Page 22 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  1) Adolescents with behavior concerning for MDD prompting a SAP triage request, 2) Adolescents 
identified with MDD by [CONTACT_367668], and 3) Adolescents who successfully eng age with at least one 
SAP recommendation   
 
Concern for MDD based on a primary or secondary potentially MDD related SAP "incoming referral 
reason"  
 
SAP triage is not diagnostic, so MDD identified based on recommendations for MDD related school or 
community  services (e.g. mental health treatment services)  
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_459662] and/or SAP.  No identifiable information will be collected b y study staff.   
 
MDD screen positive or MDD concern prompting Student Assistance Program triage  
 
Universal screening arm : Adolescents who have a PHQ -9 score >11 (screening with the PHQ -9 is 
planned for September to March ) or who at any point in the school  year exhibit behavior 
concerning for MDD which prompts self or collateral request for SAP triage.  
 
Targeted screening arm : Adolescents with behavior concerning for MDD which prompts self or 
collateral request for SAP triage at any point during the school year.  
 
Suicidal adolescent (includes suicidal thoughts [positive response to PHQ -9 item 9], attempts and 
completed)  
 
Universal screening arm : Patient health questionnaire positive response to question #9 re: suicidal 
thoughts, which requires management by [CONTACT_172331] -mandated school crisis plan or student self 
or collateral report of suicidal thoughts, which requires management by [CONTACT_172331] -mandated 
school crisis plan (source school district).  
 
Targeted screening arm : Student self or collateral report of suic idal thoughts, which requires 
management by [CONTACT_172331] -mandated school crisis plan (source school district).  
Any student suicide attempts or completed suicides shared with the school district will also be 
included.  
 
MDD identification  
Universal and targeted  screening arms : Adolescents who are identified as having MDD based on 
triage by [CONTACT_367669].  As SAP triage is not diagnostic, MDD identified will be based on 
SAP recommendations for school or community services which are MDD related (e.g. mental 
health treatment services).

Additional data points to be obtained for subgroup analyses  include:  
 At the individual level:  
o Sex - male or female   
o Ethnicity - Hispanic vs. non -Hispanic  
o Race - white, black or other  
o Urban /rural – students will be categorized as enrol led in urban or  rural school 
districts based on the definition applied by [CONTACT_367646], a Legislative 
Agency of the PA General Assembly for the district  
 
 At the aggregate level, the following variables will be collected:  
o District socioeconomic status  
o School size – school enrollment. Data will be obtained from school districts 
based on enrollment as of October [ADDRESS_459664]  
o Ratio of guidance counselors/students – The ratio of counselors to students will 
be obtained from each school district  
o Schoo l-based mental health services – schools will be categorized by [CONTACT_367647] -based mental health services (yes vs. no) based on 
information obtained from each school district.  
 
We need to collect data at the individual level for [ADDRESS_459665] 
approximately 20% of students to opt out from the study, with opt out rates varying by [CONTACT_479].  
Aggregate data would necessarily include outcomes for students who are not enrolled in the 
study.  This is particularly problematic for the  universal screening group because students who 
opt out will not be offered the depression screening tool (PHQ -9).  Second, we need to obtain 
gender and race/ethnicity to conduct important planned secondary analyses (subgroup 
analyses) that will examine ef ficacy of universal screening by [CONTACT_367648].  In particular, we 
expect that females and minority students will have much higher rates of major depression 
disorder identified in the universal screening group.  Third, in the universal screening group, we 
will be able to link responses to the PHQ -9 to outcomes, which will allow for estimation of 
important measures such as the false positive rate of the PHQ -9 (score ≥11, but SAP process 
determines no further referrals are needed).  These measures will inform decision -making 
regarding the potential for implementation of the intervention (in other schools) should the 
results of the trial ultimately show efficacy.   
 
2.0 Background  
 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps  
The prevalence of annual major depressive disorder (M DD) epi[INVESTIGATOR_367639] 
8.3% in 2008 to 12.5% in 2015.1 Close to 30% of adolescents with MDD reported suicidality in the prior 
year, with more than one in ten making a suicide attempt.2 As a result, suicide was the 2nd leading 
cause of death among youth 10 -24 years of age as of 2014.3 Baseline data from HealthyPeople.gov 
 
Page 24 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  found that only 2.1% of adolescent primary care office visits included depression screening in the years 
[ADDRESS_459666] MDD, but 
less likely to be treated than males.1,2,6 In response to the growing mental health crisis, the US 
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) endorsed universal screening for adolescent MDD in primary 
care in 2009.7,8 The Hea lthyPeople.gov 2020 goal is a 10% increase in screening to a rate of 2.3%, which 
fails to address this adolescent  public health crisis.[ADDRESS_459667] experts in family medicine, 
pediatrics, psychology and child psychiatry agree that surveillance of adolescents at high -risk for  
MDD is warranted, the USPSTF updated their recommendations in 2016 with a call to address  
several know ledge gaps:  
1) Does screening increase the proportion of adolescents identified with MDD?  
2) What are the benefits and unintended consequences of MDD screening for subgroups:  
age, sex, race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES)?  
3) What are the benefit s and unintended consequences of screening in nonclinical settings?[ADDRESS_459668] academic success (e.g. vision, hearing). However, 
while current school screenings add ress multiple physical health domains, none address mental health.10 
Targeted mental health screening is the current school process for students who display signs 
concerning for MDD and results in referral to the school’s Student Assistance Program (SAP). SAP 
operates in all [ADDRESS_459669], from April -Sept  2016 we 
conducted eight focus groups (7 -10 participants each, n=62) to better understand the perspective of key 
stakeholders regarding Whole Child Health, specifically the importance of both physical and mental 
wellness. These focus groups included 2 pare nt groups, 2 school nurse groups, 2 groups of school 
teachers and administrators and 2 groups of medical providers (pediatrics and family medicine). The 
work was funded by [CONTACT_367671] -Children, Youth and Families 
Consor tium. Participant conversations were instrumental in shapi[INVESTIGATOR_367633]. In addition, 
following the aforementioned focus groups, we conducted a Community Engagement Studio in August 
2017 funded by [CONTACT_367672] I nstitute. These 2 hour sessions are 
specifically intended to inform grant proposals that depend upon successful community engagement. 
Participant perspectives ranged from adolescent to parent, school staff, the leaders of two mental 
health and suicide prev ention organizations (Aevidum and the Jana Marie Foundation), a Behavioral 
Health Managed Care company representative and the project director of Pennsylvania’s Garrett Lee 
Smith Youth Suicide Prevention Grant in addition to our Penn State Research team.

ethnic groups. Adolescent females demonstrated rates of MDD epi[INVESTIGATOR_17767] 3 times that of males

Disease Control and Prevention data.13,14 
Adolescent MDD has negative effects on academic performance, with increasing severity of depressive 
symptoms linked to a lower grade point average as well as subjective assessments of increased  school 
workload and concentration difficulties. Adolescents with untreated MDD experience poorer 
interpersonal relationships, lower self -esteem, social isolation, and increased risk -taking behaviors 
including substance use, as well as multiple physical an d mental health comorbidities in adulthood.7,8,15 -

problem is that 50 -75% of these adolescents will develop subsequent MDD epi[INVESTIGATOR_42988] [ADDRESS_459674] individuals reporting residual symptoms or impairment.18 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_367637], there has been no change in mental health treatme nt among 
adolescents with a MDD epi[INVESTIGATOR_367638] 2005 -2014.6 Only 36 -44% of children and adolescents with MDD 
receive treatment, underscoring that MDD is underdiagnosed and undertreated.[ADDRESS_459675] a primary care provider, 
data from HealthyPeople.gov indicates a steady decline in rates of screening with only 1.4% of primary 
care office visits including MDD screening as of 2009 - 2011.4 In addition to minorities, rural youth and 
those of lower SES receive fewer preventive  care services than their white, urban, high SES 
counterparts, further limiting their access to  MDD screening in the context of well -care.20,21 
 
3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Students in gra des 9 -12 at 14  public schools (XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ) in Pennsylvania that previously 
committed to partner with us in this project. HRP -504- School Permission to Conduct Research forms 
will be uploaded  in our CATS application documentation for each partici pating district to show district 
approval of the opt out procedure and to agree with their 3rd Party Protection of Pupil Rights 
Amendment (PPRA) policies. Further, included as supporting documents are letters from 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  who have all acknowle dged and shown support of the opt out approach.  
 
School staff who assisted with the screener/screening process will be asked to complete a 45 minute 
interview using our Year 1 or Year 2 feedback guide documents (included in supporting documents).

research. In total, the rural schools serve approximately 3,900 students (HRSA Study) and were selected 
as they represent a large number of low SES , rural student populations who have known disparities in 
mental health services.  The additional PCORI funded urban schools XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  adds an 
additional 8,150 students. Additionally, we will recruit 1 -2 school staff members to participate in our 
feedback guide interview upon completion of the screener/screening process year. We are not 
collecting any PHI, nor will names of the school staff participants be disclosed in the use of manuscripts/ 
written publications.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_459678], we will pu rsue 
opt-out consent for screening given the importance of MDD screening and the low -risk aside from 
identification of a suicidal student. Parents will be informed of their child’s enrollment in screening and 
given the opportunity to opt out prior to the f all intervention.  For this proposal, in cases of a shared 
custody agreement, if either parent or guardian opts out of the study, the student will be considered 
ineligible for enrollment. In this case, no information will be collected, even in the case of s tudents 
randomized to the targeted screening arm, which is the usual school process. An additional opt -out 
letter was created for HRSA schools, as one participating school did not send opt -out letters to parents 
whose children were randomized to the target  (control) arm of the trial. This letter has been included in 
supporting documents and will be sent in spring 2020, after the intervention has ended. No information 
will be collected for those students whose parents return these opt -out forms by [CONTACT_367673]. Also, any participating student randomized to the universal screening arm who does not assent at 
the time of screening will not  be required to complete the screening form. Students [ADDRESS_459679] the opportunity to opt out of study involvement if desired.  We will be contact[CONTACT_367674]/verbal consent for  participating in our

4.3 Recruitment materials  
No recruitment materials will be needed for this study. However, a letter will be sent home to parents to 
inform them of their child’s enrollment in the screening and given the opportu nity to opt out prior to 
the intervention. If they do not wish to participate, parents will be asked to return the Opt -Out form in -
person or by [CONTACT_2319]. Opt -out letters will be printed on district letterhead to include the participating 
school’s mailing addre ss. Parents may also return the form signed and scanned, if the school decides to 
send the letter via email. A copy of the PHQ -9 questionnaire will be included in the letter sent to the 
parents. Additionally, the opt -out letter will be tra nslated into a Sp anish  by [CONTACT_367651].  An additional opt -out letter was created for HRSA schools, as 
one participating school did not send opt -out letters to parents whose children were randomized to the 
target (control) arm of the trial. This letter has been included in supporting documents and will be sent 
in spring 2020, after the intervention has ended. Parents will be asked to email or mail their signed opt -
out letter if they do not want their child to participate in the control arm.

5.1.2 Waiver or alteration of the infor med consent requirement  
We are requesting a waiver of the informed consent requirement. We are pursuing opt -out 
consent for screening given the important of MDD screening and the low -risk aside from 
identification of a suicidal student. At 14 years of age,  PA youth are eligible to consent to mental 
health services without parental consent. Our use of the opt out is really intended to include 
and engage the parents and communities we are working with. The opt out will be a letter sent 
home to parents (either  via email or regular mail as per school preference) giving them the 
option to decline participation for their student. School s will be responsible for tracking students 
whose parents have opted -out. In addition, students in the universal arm will have the  option to 
decline participation themselves on the screening day via the iPad handed to them. The first 
screen will describe PHQ -9; inform students that participation is voluntary; and participation 
may be stopped at any time and will not affect their scho ol standing or grades.

We are requesting a waiver of informed consent. Rather, parents/guardians will 
receive an opt -out form. We are pursuing opt -out consent for screening given the 
important of MDD screening and the low -risk aside from ide ntification of a suicidal 
student. At 14 years of age, PA youth are eligible to consent to mental health services 
without parental consent. Our use of the opt out is really intended to include and

inform students that participation is volu ntary; and participation may be stopped at 
any time and will not affect their school standing. The completion of the PHQ -9 implies 
a student’s voluntary consent to participate in the research. Students who decide not 
to participate will not complete the PH Q-9, but will still be tracked similar to students  
randomized to the targeted screening arm. The study team will obtain their 
demographic information and the student will b e followed through the academic year 
for SAP triage intakes initiated by [CONTACT_367676] d pathway (concern by [CONTACT_144823], nurse, 
parent, peer, or self -referral), any referrals and treatment engagement.  No identifiable

7.0 Study Design and Procedures  
 
7.1 Study Design  
Due to the timeline for this funding opportunity, with an anticipated July 2018 start, 3 schools will 
engage in the randomized control trial (RCT) in study year [ADDRESS_459681] 3 participating schools.  The intervention ended early in study year 2 
(March 2020) due to the COVID -19 pandemic and schools subsequently ending in -person instruction. 
 
Page 30 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  The study team was unable to complete PHQ -9 screeners with two participating schools 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX . SAP outcome data will still be collected for all enrolled students (i.e., those 
whose parents did not return the opt -out form) fo r the 2019 -2020 (study year 2) school year.  
At the completion of the year one screener/ screening process, school staff will be asked to complete 
the Final Feedback Guide document to assist in our research/ knowledge of the study process and 
procedures. S taff members from two schools completed the Feedback Guide interview 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_367641].

Final Feedback guide at  the end of the 2019/2020 school year. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic occurring 
during the 2019/[ADDRESS_459686] updated the Final Feedback guide to include questions 
relevant to student mental health concerns.  
 
7.2 Study Procedures  
 
7.2.1 Enrollment  
Parents  will be informed of their child’s enrollment in screening and given the opportunity to opt  
out prior to the fall intervention. The opt out will be a letter sent home to parents (either via email or 
regular mail as per school preference) giving them the op tion to decline participation for their student. 
The study team will provide each school with unique study IDs to be assigned to every student, grades [ADDRESS_459687] (spreadsheet 
template) ensuring that all students, grades [ADDRESS_459688] will include 
student names (first and last), PASECURED ID, unique study ID and demographics information (grade, 
age, sex, race and ethnicity). Schools will remove student names and PASECUREID before sending the 
spreadshe et to the study team. The full linking list (including student name [CONTACT_367687]) will 
remain on the school’s spreadsheet and in the school’s possession for tracking of study outcomes 
through the year. By [CONTACT_2329] a unique study ID for each student, the s tudy team will never receive 
identifiable information of students. If a parent returns the opt -out form, school staff will still assign a 
student a unique study ID but no demographic information will be included. This is so the study team 
may properly repo rt the number of opt -out letters returned. This procedure ensures that students 
whose parents have opted -out are not tracked throughout the year.  
 
At the time of the actual universal screening students will also be provided the chance to opt out by 
[CONTACT_367677] . We anticipate this will lead to study 
enrollment of 80% of eligible students.  The first screen will describe PHQ -9 and that proceeding is 
voluntary. The completion of the PHQ -9 implies a student’s  voluntary consent to participate in the 
research.  Unless the parent opt out is returned, p articipants in both arms will be followed through the 
school year for SAP triage, follow -up referrals and treatment engagement. Those students in the 
universal scree ning arm with PHQ -9 scores > 11 (MDD screen positive) corresponding to moderate 
depressive symptoms, will proceed through the standard process for anyone referred by [CONTACT_367678] a SAP triage interview. The student will either be referred to approp riate community or 
 
Page 31 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  school -based treatment or SAP will determine no follow -up is needed. For those who are recommended 
to additional services by [CONTACT_367655], treatment engagement will be tracked per current SAP processes. The 
study team will receive individual leve l outcome data  from the school district, containing no identifiable 
information.  
 
Additionally, we will recruit 1 -2 school staff members to participate in our feedback guide interview 
upon completion of the screener/screening process year. We are not colle cting any PHI, nor will names 
of the school staff participants be disclosed in the use of manuscripts/ written publications. Staff 
members from two schools were recruited and completed the Final Feedback Guide interview 
XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_252450] e nsure the final version of the Feedback Guide was thorough and 
comprehensive.   
 
To better understand the long -term feasibility of the screening process, school contacts who 
participated in the first year of screening will be asked to participate in a Year 2 feedback guide 
interview. This guide will provide information about the screening process impacts and sustainability in 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  high schools. The remaining schools who participated in screenings 
during the 2019 -2020 school year, will p articipate in the Year 2 feedback guide interview at the end of 
the 2020 -2021 school year.  
 
 
7.2.2 Randomization  
We will randomize by [CONTACT_367656] -time universal screening (via 
PHQ -9) or targeted screening (current SAP p rocess). For the schools included in the study, half of the  
schools (50%) will be randomized such that students in 9th and 11th grades will receive universal 
screening and students in 10th and 12th grades will receive targeted screening, and the other half  (50%) 
will be randomized such that students in 9th and 11th grades will receive targeted screening and 
students in 10th and 12th grades will receive universal screening. Randomization will be done only for 
students whose parents do not signal an unwilling ness to participate in the study (“opt out”). Students 
and study personnel will not be blinded to randomized group at each school site. Randomization will be 
done by [CONTACT_367657] -based screenings are 
grade-specific (e.g. hearing screen in 11th grade) and screenings for a grade occur at the same time. The 
study will be conducted within schools, but it is not a cluster randomized study, in which an entire 
school (cluster) is assigned to one of the study gr oups. A cluster randomized study was considered but 
ultimately not pursued because randomization within schools controls for (1) within -school (community) 
factors that may contribute to higher or lower rates of SAP referral, (2) differences in school sizes , and 
(3) potential differences in rates of parental opt out among schools. These benefits were balanced 
against the concern of potential contamination between study groups, whereby [CONTACT_367679] -wide pus h to conduct universal screening.  
 
7.2.3 Universal MDD Screening Arm (Intervention – Treatment)  
Students randomized to the universal screening arm will complete a PHQ -9. This screening tool includes 
nine close -ended questions with a scoring system ranging from [ADDRESS_459689] any student from participating whose parent returned the opt -out letter. No 
names or other ide ntifying information will be used. Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_367642] -9 will be 
 
Page 32 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  available as a backup should problems arise with internet connectivity. The same measures will be taken 
to ensure no names or other identifying information is used or collected .  
 
In order to immediately identify suicidal intent the survey will be set to flag positive questions in real 
time.  When students have completed the PHQ -9 screen the REDCap survey will prompt them to hand 
the completed questionnaire to study staff, who w ill see a screen indicating a positive flag. Students 
with suicidal intent (question #9 any response besides “Not at all”) will receive immediate evaluation 
and referral to emergency care as per current school protocols. PA schools are required to have a p lan 
to address suicidal students (Act 71). A suicidal participant identified during the screening would not be 
allowed to leave the screening area unless accompanied by [CONTACT_367659]. This 
student would then proceed through the stand ard school pathway for managing a student with 
intentions of self -harm. To ensure school staff is comfortable to manage a student in crisis and that this 
persists beyond the period of the grant, at least [ADDRESS_459690] ate 
research staff will complete online evidence -based suicide prevention training (Question, Persuade, and 
Refer [QPR] Suicide Triage Training). In addition, all school crisis plans will be carefully reviewed with 
staff following the training to ensure th e steps are realistic and staff is comfortable to execute the plan. 
The district identified, QPR trained staff member will be available at the time of screening. Study staff 
who are also QPR trained, will be present during the screening.  
 
7.2.4 Targeted Screeni ng Arm (Current Process – Control)  
Students randomized to the targeted screening arm will complete their routine school -based screenings. 
Students will be followed through the academic year for SAP triage intakes initiated by [CONTACT_367680] (concern by [CONTACT_144823], nurse, parent, peer, or self -referral), any referrals and treatment 
engagement.  
 
7.2.5 Sharing Screening Results  
At 14 years of age, PA youth are eligible to consent to mental health services without parental consent, 
therefore, screening results wi ll not be shared with parents. Those students with scores  > 11 (MDD 
screen positive) corresponding to moderate depressive symptoms will , however , proceed through the 
standard process for anyone referred by [CONTACT_367661] a SAP triage interview. The s tudent will 
either refer to appropriate community or school -based treatment or therapy (MDD identified) or SAP 
will determine no follow -up is needed. For those who are recommended to additional services by [CONTACT_367655], 
treatment engagement will be tracked per curr ent SAP process.  As per current school policy, s tudents 
with suicidal feelings will receive immediate referral to emergency care and parents will be notified by 
[CONTACT_52721] . 
 
 
7.3 Duration of Participation  
The student’s participation is limited to the [ADDRESS_459691] an estimated total enrollment of  
approximately 3,900 students (the PCORI funded urban schools have a total enrollment of 
approximately 8,150 students). The overall rate of parental opt out is expect ed to be around 20%, 
 
Page 33 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  resulting in approximately 9,640 students included in the study. We assumed a 15% attrition rate for 
students who move, drop out of school, or opt out later in the school year. This number will be finalized 
once we have a final confirm ed list of participating schools. However, as the total number of students is 
greater than that originally projected below, the sample size determination  section  will be unchanged . 
 
8.2 Sample size determination  
A total of 4,820   (estimated)  students in each randomized group (an overall sample size of 9,640   
[estimated] ) yields >99% statistical power to detect a difference of 3% versus 6% using a [ADDRESS_459692] 
conducted at a Type I error rate of 5% in a mixed effect logistic regression model.  
 
8.3 Statistical meth ods 
The principles of intention -to-treat (ITT) will be used for all statistical analyses related to primary and 
secondary aims. For the primary aim comparing universal to targeted screening, the statistical analysis 
will be conducted using a mixed effects logistic regression model. The primary outcome, MDD 
composite, will be an indicator whether a student was screen positive (or concerns raised in the 
targeted screening arm), identified as having MDD and subsequently engaged in treatment (1=yes, 
0=no). The model will include a fixed effect for randomized group (0=targeted screening, 1=universal 
screening) and a random effect for school. The random effect accounts for correlation among students 
enrolled within the same school. The primary parameter of interes t will be the log odds of MDD 
composite in the universal screening group compared to the targeted screening group. Statistical 
significance of the log odds will be assessed using a [ADDRESS_459693]. Point estimates for the odds ratio 
along with a 95% conf idence interval will be reported.  
 
For the analysis of Hypotheses 2 and 3 (Objective 1) evaluating universal screening and targeted 
screening by [CONTACT_367662], the same mixed effects logistic regression modeling framework will be 
used, but the model w ill be extended by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a fixed effect for subgroup and an interaction effect 
for subgroup by [CONTACT_196880]. The interaction term will be the parameter of interest. A significant 
interaction term indicates that rates of MDD treatment engagement for  universal versus targeted 
screening differ by [CONTACT_367663] (e.g. female vs. male). For the  secondary  analys es (Objective 2) that 
evaluates universal screening and targeted screening based on school SAP data, we will have only 64  
total data  points (4 gr ades in each of  the 14  schools). Mixed -effects linear (continuous outcomes) and 
logistic regression (binary outcomes) will be used, as appropriate, with a fixed effect for randomized 
group and a random effect for school. The parameter of interest will be  the log odds for the universal 
compared to the targeted screening group. Due to the smaller sample size used for these outcomes, 
these analyses will be considered to be primarily hypothesis -generating. Potential mediating variables 
(socioeconomic status, ratio of guidance counselors to students and availability of school -based mental 
health services) will be evaluated for both the Objective 1 and 2 hypotheses.  
 
Additional secondary outcomes will include MDD screen results, MDD concern prompting Student 
Assistance Program triage, MDD identification and MDD treatment engagement analyzed individually 
(rather than as part of MDD composite). Finally any suicidal adolescents (suicidal thoughts [positive 
response to PHQ -9 item 9], attempts and completed) will be a nalyzed as a secondary outcome.  
 
We need to collect data for individuals for [ADDRESS_459694] approximately 20% of 
students to opt out from the study, with opt out rates varying by [CONTACT_479].  Aggregate data would 
necessarily include outcomes for students who are not enrolled in the study.  This is particularly 
problematic for the universal screening group because students who opt out will not be offered the 
depression screening tool (PHQ -9).  Second, we need to obtain gender and race/ethnicity  to conduct 
important planned secondary analyses (subgroup analyses) that will examine efficacy of universal 
screening by [CONTACT_367648].  In particular, we expect that females and minority students will have much 
higher rates of major depression disorder id entified in the universal screening group.  Third, in the 
 
Page 34 of 41 (V.04/27/2017)  universal screening group, we will be able to link responses to the PHQ -9 to outcomes, which will allow 
for estimation of important measures such as the false positive rate of the PHQ -9 (score ≥11, but SAP 
process determines no further referrals are needed).  These measures will inform decision -making 
regarding the potential for implementation of the intervention (in other schools) should the results of 
the trial ultimately show efficacy.   
 
Efforts will be made to ensure completeness of data where possible, but missing data will occur for a 
number of anticipated reasons. First, a student may move during the course of the school year to 
another school district or drop out from school entirely. No data  will be collected after this time point. 
Second, parents may opt out their child from the study at any time during the school year. Third, 
students who turn [ADDRESS_459695] data forms 
incomplete, including the PHQ -9. To decrease these instances, the PHQ -9 will be taken on an iPad 
program and the survey will alert if the form is left incomplete.

Please see HRP -598 - Research Data Plan Review Form

N/A: This study does not involve more than minimal risk to subjects, and the magnitude of harm/discomfort is 
not greater than that ordinarily encountered in daily life.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_459696] cannot be overstated. MDD is a prevalent, 
disabling and a growing US public health problem. The problem is identified by [CONTACT_367681]’s health care priorities (Healthy People 2020, US Department of Health and 
Human Services). MDD leads both to functional impairment and higher rates of morbidity and mortality. 
In addition, MDD leads to significant social and eco nomic consequences, including increased use of 
health resources and lost work productivity. A public health goal should include identification of those at 
risk for depression with the delivery of interventions to these individuals. Schools are a point of 
intervention with a high potential for early identification and prevention. Currently, fewer than 2 out of 
every 100 adolescents receives guideline -concordant major depression screening. We propose reaching 
nearly 80 of every 100 adolescents in the school s etting, vastly increasing the identification of 
adolescents suffering from MDD with a goal to decrease both morbidity and mortality. Schools are an 
ideal partner for this approach, given their tremendous reach across the nation to nearly all adolescents.

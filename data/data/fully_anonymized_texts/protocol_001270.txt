Site-Specific  
Global 
Rationale for the Amendment 
The rationale for the major changes in this protocol amendment are as follows: 
• The availability of new Phase 2 data raised the question of a cannabidiol (CBD) interaction. As a result, 
patients taking CBD will be monitored closely for adverse events (AEs), and specifically sedation-related AEs throughout the study. Patients were also stratified according to concomitant CBD use. 
• The allowance of an additional 2 weeks of titration after the 4 weeks titration period at the start of the maintenance period was removed as were specific dosing paradigms for participants taking Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321] > 10 mg/kg/day. This change will ensure that all patients will have the same target dose regardless of their background CBD therapy.  
Description of Changes  Section(s) Affected by [CONTACT_458611], consistency, and clarity. Throughout the document 
Protocol date and version added to the header. Protocol header 
Protocol short name ‘TrustTSC’ added to the protocol title.  Title page, sponsor signatory, Investigator agreement and Section 1.1 
The Investigational New Drug (IND) number was updated and the EudraCT number was added.   Title page 
Updated the key secondary efficacy endpoint. 
Added: 
• Number (%) of participants considered treatment responders during the 
maintenance phase.  Section 1.1, Section 3, Section 9.3.3  
Updated the overall study design so that there was no longer an additional allowance for titration during the maintenance period and to remove specific dosing paradigms for patients taking Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321] > 10 mg/kg/day as this will ensure all patients have the same target dose regardless of background therapy.  
Removed: 
• With 2 additional weeks allowed, if necessary, for tolerance and use of 
concomitant cannabidiols (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]/Epi[INVESTIGATOR_31624]) as follows.  
• For participants not taking concomitant Epi[INVESTIGATOR_458549] a dose of 10 mg/kg/day or less, the target dose is:   
• 63 mg/kg/day for those weighing 28 kg or less, or  
• 1800 mg/day for those weighing more than 28 kg. 
• For participants taking concomitant Epi[INVESTIGATOR_458550] a dose greater than 10 mg/kg/day, the target dose is:  
• 42 mg/kg/day for those weighing 28 kg or less, or  
• 1200 mg/day for those weighing more than 28 kg.  
• The reduction of the GNX target dose for patients on cannabidiol > 10 mg/kg/day is based on Section 1.1, Section 1.2, Section 4.1, Section 4.3, Section 6.2, Section 8.1.2

1.1 Synopsis 
Protocol Title:  A Phase 3, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo- controlled Trial of Adjunctive Ganaxolone 
(GNX) Treatment in Children and Adults with  Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-related 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (TrustTSC).  
Brief Title:  
Adjunctive GNX Treatment Compared with Placebo in Children and Adults with TSC-related Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  
Indication: TSC-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. 
Rationale:  
TSC is a multi-system disorder of embryonal cort ical development that can affect many organs 
through the overgrowth of benign tumors known as hamartomas. While the disease phenotype 
can be extremely variable, neurologic manifestatio ns such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_458557] 90% 
of patients with TSC ( Krueger and Northrup, 2013 ). The condition is caused by [CONTACT_59714]1  (hamartin) gene, located on chromosome 9q34, or the TSC2  
(tuberin) gene located on chromosome 16p13.3. TS C occurs with a frequency of 1:6,000 and a 
mutation is found in 85% of patients ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014). The gene products TSC1 and 
TSC2 form a regulatory complex responsible for limiting the activity of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), an important intracellular regulator of growth and metabolism 
via its inhibition of the small GTPase Rheb (Krueger and Northrup, 2013 ). Everolimus 
(Afinitor
®), amTORC1 inhibitor, has been shown to decrease seizures ( Mizuguchi et al, 2019 ; 
French et al, 2016 ). More recently, cannabidiol (CBD; Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]®) demonstrated seizure 
reduction efficacy in a randomized controlled trial ( Thiele et al, 2021 ).  
TSC is one of the most common genetic causes of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], with seizure type and characteristics 
that vary by [CONTACT_654] ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014). Infantile spasm (IS) is the most common seizure type 
presenting in infancy and represents the first ma nifestation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_58824] 50% of patients. In 
older children and adults, focal impaired awareness seizures (previously classified as complex 
partial seizures) are the most common ( Chu-Shore et al., 2010 ); other focal and generalized 
seizures may also occur. Over 30% of pa tients develop treatment-refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] 
(Jülich and Sahin, 2014). While seizures have typi[INVESTIGATOR_458558], epi[INVESTIGATOR_458559] 
(Jülich and Sahin, 2014).  
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) appears to play  a central role in the development of 
TSC-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], possibly due to  altered expression of endogenous GABA A receptor 
modulators ( Di Michele et al, 2003 ). The 3α5-reduced-tetrahydroprogesterone (THP) metabolites 
of progesterone, including 3 α, 5α-THP (allopregnanolone), are positive allosteric modulators of 
the GABA A receptor. In contrast, 3 β5-THP acts as functional antagonists of the GABA A receptor 
Ganaxolone Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
Protocol 1042-TSC-3001 
Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.[ADDRESS_585857] demonstrated decreases  in allopregnanolone and 3 α, 5β-THP relative 
to 3β5-THP enantiomers in patients with TSC-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_458560]. This change in the ratio of 3 α5- and 3β 5-THP enantiomers could 
alter neuronal excitability mediated by [CONTACT_59716] A receptors and predispose to the development of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_458561]. The role of GABA A receptor mediation is also supported by [CONTACT_458620], a specific and irreversible i nhibitor of GABA-aminotransferase leading to 
increased synaptic GABA levels, in seizures due to TSC relative to other epi[INVESTIGATOR_31629] (Curatolo et al, 2001 ). These findings provide compelling evidence for the potential role of 
neuroactive steroids in the trea tment of TSC-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  
GNX is the 3 β-methylated synthetic analog of allo pregnanolone, an e ndogenous allosteric 
modulator of central nervous system (CNS) GABA
A receptors. GNX has potency and efficacy 
comparable to allopregnanolone in activ ating synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A receptors at a 
site distinct from benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_59684] ( Carter et al, 1997 ). GNX has protective 
activity in diverse rodent seizure models ( Reddy and Rogwski, 2012 ; Bialer et al, 2010 ). Clinical 
studies have demonstrated that GNX has anticonvulsant activity with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the dose range of  900 to 1800 mg in adults and children 
(Sperling et al, 2017 ; Laxer et al, 2000 ; Kerrigan et al, 2000 ; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_59662], 2007 ). Further, 
GNX reduces seizures in children with IS and refractory pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. In an open-label 
study (OL), pediatric participants aged 2 to 60 months with refractory seizures and a history of 
IS were treated with GNX doses up to 36 mg/kg for up to 3 months ( Kerrigan et al, 2000 ). There 
were 15 participants with a history of IS who co mpleted treatment; 5 of the 15 participants had a 
decrease from baseline in the number of spasms of ≥ 50%, 5 had a decrease of 25% to 50%, and 
5 had a decrease of < 25%. There was 1 participant who became spasm-free and 1 non responder 
(with a decrease of < 25%) was spasm-free from Weeks 2 to 7.  
In addition to its anticonvulsant activity, GNX ha s been shown to reduce anxiety, hyperactivity, 
and attention in children with fragile X syndrome ( Ligsay et al, 2016 ). Similar behavior 
problems occur in individuals with TSC, with  rates of approximately 50% for attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autistic spectrum disorder ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014).  
In TSC-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], Study 1042-TSC-2001 was a Phase 2, single arm study with GNX. The 
primary objective was to assess the preliminar y safety and efficacy of GNX as adjunctive 
therapy for the treatment of seizures in participants aged 2 to 65 years with genetically or clinically confirmed TSC-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. The study consisted of a 4-week baseline followed by 
a treatment phase, consisting of a 4-week titration and 8-week maintenance period. The primary 
efficacy endpoint was the percent reduction in countable, TSC-associated seizures from the 
baseline through the end of the Period A treatme nt phase. Review of data for the primary 
endpoint showed a median 16.6% reduction in  28-day primary endpoint  seizure frequency 
relative to the 4-week baseline period, with 30. 4% of patients achieving a 50% or more seizure 
reduction. The clinical study report (CSR) for this study was completed on 08 Mar 2023. 
It is hypothesized that the augmentation of GABA
A-receptor mediated signaling with GNX 
treatment will reduce seizures in patients with  TSC. Changes in neurobehavioral symptoms, 
mood, sleep and quality of life will also be assessed.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 175 Overall Design:  
This is a Phase 3, global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive GNX 
treatment in children and adults with TSC-rela ted epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. The study consists of a 4-week 
prospective baseline phase, defined as the firs t [ADDRESS_585858] 2 anti-seiz ure medication (ASMs) administered at adequate 
doses and for adequate durations, with approximately [ADDRESS_585859] of care, will not be 
performed until written informed consent from the participant or their parent(s)/ legally 
authorized representative (s) (LARs), as appr opriate, has been appropriately obtained.  
An interactive response technology system will be used to randomize participants, dispense drug, track treatment, and maintain the blin d throughout the duration of the study.  
Participants or their parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) are expected to complete electronic seizure 
diary (eDiary) entries to document the number an d type(s) of seizures daily throughout the study. 
A variety of clinician and caregiver administered instruments will be used to assess efficacy, and 
will include:  
• Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S). 
• Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) by [CONTACT_7078](s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and clinician. 
• Caregiver Global Impression of Change in  Seizure Intensity/D uration (CGI-CSID). 
• Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS). 
• Pediatric Quality of Life – Family Impact Module (Peds-QL-FIM). 
• Short Form 36 (SF-36). 
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_458562] (ELDQOL). 
The titration schedule is as follows: 
• Start – Day 1. 
• Titration 1 – Day 7. 
• Titration 2 – Day 14. 
• Titration 3 – Day 21. 
• Final titration – Day 28. 
• Maintenance begins on Day 29 (Start of Week 5). 
GNX (or matching volumes of placebo suspension)  will be titrated at approximately weekly 
intervals over 4 weeks to a maximum dose based on  the participant’s starting weight 63 mg/kg/day 
with a maximum daily dose of 1800 mg (for patients more than 28 kg).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 175 The Phase 2 data for GNX in TSC raised the question of a CBD interaction. In the trial of 
23 treated patients, approximately  half were on cannabidiol, and there was an association 
between higher CBD doses and increased somnolence. Given the small sample size, more definitive conclusions were not possible. As a result, patients taking CBD should be monitored 
closely for any sedation-related adverse even ts (AEs) throughout this Phase [ADDRESS_585860] (IP) temporarily or permanently 
decreased at any point in the maintenance period to manage tolerability.  
Any dose adjustments that are not part of the pr especified titration schedule should be discussed 
with the sponsor medical monitor prior to making the change. If it is not possible to contact [CONTACT_458623], the medical monitor should be notified as soon as 
possible after making the change.  
The maximum dose for all participants is 1800 mg/day. The total double-blind phase (titration 
and maintenance periods) should not exceed [ADDRESS_585861] the option to enroll and be treated with GNX in a separate open-label 
extension study (OLE), 1042-TSC-3002. All particip ants entering the OLE will have their dose 
of study medication adjusted in a double-blind cross-titration over 4 weeks such that all are 
receiving GNX at study completion. Participants who do not continue in the OLE will undergo a 
2- to 4-weeks double-blind down-titration and taper if discontinuing IP (See Figure 1). 
Disclosure Statement:  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm treatment study that is participant, 
caregiver, and investigator blinded.  
Number of Participants:  
Approximately 200 participants with TSC will be screened with the aim of randomizing 
approximately 128 participants (64 per arm), aged 1 to 65 years (inclusive). For Europe (EU), 
Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and Oceania (OC) Male or Female participants aged 
2 through 65 years, inclusive. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to either GNX or placebo as adjunctive therapy with their standard ASMs.  
Note: Enrolled means the participant, or their LAR(s), has agreed to participate in the study 
following completion of the informed consent process and screening. Potential participants who 
are screened for the purpose of determining elig ibility for the study, but who subsequently are 
not eligible for study entry, are not considered enrolled, unless otherwise specified by [CONTACT_12695].

19. Participants receiving traditional Chinese medicine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_458547] 28 days of the 
screening. 
Intervention Groups and Duration:  
Eligible participants will collect 4 weeks of prospective baseline seizure data prior to starting treatment. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to double-blind treatment with GNX or placebo. 
Stratification of randomization will be perf ormed based on whether the patient is taking 
concomitant CBD or not. GNX is to be titrated to the target dose over 4 weeks. The total double-
blind phase (titration and ma intenance periods) should not exceed 16 weeks.  
Participants who complete the study may be eligible to participate in the OLE. However, 
participants who discontinue IP should undergo a 2- week or shorter taper period, as clinically 
indicated, and complete the safety follow- up assessments 2 weeks after the final dose.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 45 of 175 2 INTRODUCTION 
Ganaxolone (GNX) is a small molecule being deve loped for use as an ASM in rare pediatric 
seizure disorders including cyclin-dependent kina se-like 5 deficiency disorder (CDD), tuberous 
sclerosis complex (TSC)-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (SE).  
GNX has also been investigated in adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), migraine, 
postpartum depression ([COMPANY_003]), and children with protocadherin (PCDH)-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and 
fragile X syndrome (FXS). 
2.1 Study Rationale 
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) appears to play  a central role in the development of 
TSC-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], possibly due to  altered expression of endogenous GABA A receptor 
modulators ( Di Michele et al, 2003 ). The 3α5-reduced-tetrahydroprogesterone  (THP) metabolites 
of progesterone, including 3 α, 5α-THP (allopregnanolone), are positive allosteric modulators of 
the GABA A receptor. In contrast, [ADDRESS_585881] on the GABA A receptor. 
Di Michele et al (2003) have demonstrated decreases  in allopregnanolone and 3 α, 5β-THP 
relative to 3 β5-THP enantiomers in patients with TSC-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_458570], or in controls. This change in the ratio of 3 α5- and 3β5-THP enantiomers 
could alter neuronal excitability mediated by [CONTACT_59716] A receptors and predispose to the 
development of epi[INVESTIGATOR_458561]. The role of GABA A receptor mediation is also supported by [CONTACT_458627], a specific and irreversible inhibitor of GABA-aminotransferase 
leading to increased synaptic GABA levels, in seizures due to TSC relative to other epi[INVESTIGATOR_31629] 
(Curatolo et al, 2001 ). These findings provide compelling evidence for the potential role of 
neuroactive steroids in the trea tment of TSC-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  
It is hypothesized that the augmentation of GABA A-receptor mediated signaling with GNX 
treatment will reduce seizures in patients with  TSC. Changes in neurobehavioral symptoms, 
mood, sleep, and quality of life will also be assessed. 
2.[ADDRESS_585882] many organs 
through the overgrowth of benign tumors known as hamartomas. While the disease phenotype 
can be extremely variable, neurologic manifestatio ns such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_458557] 90% 
of TSC patients ( Krueger and Northrup, 2013 ). The condition is caused by [CONTACT_458628]1  (hamartin) gene, located on chromosome 9q34, or the TSC2  (tuberin) gene 
located on chromosome 16p13.3. TSC occurs with a frequency of 1:6,000 and a mutation is found in 85% of patients ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014). The gene products TSC1 and TSC2 form a 
regulatory complex responsible for limiting the act ivity of mTORC1, an important intracellular 
regulator of growth and metabolism via its inhi bition of the small GTPase Ras homolog enriched

rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor, has been shown to decrease seizures (Mizuguchi et al, 2019 ; French et al, 2016 ). More recently, CBD (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]
®) demonstrated 
seizure reduction efficacy in a randomized controlled trial ( Thiele et al, 2021 ).  
TSC is one of the most common genetic causes of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], with seizure type and characteristics 
that vary by [CONTACT_654] ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014). Infantile spasm (IS) is the most common seizure type 
presenting in infancy and represents the first ma nifestation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_58824] 50% of patients. In 
older children and adults, focal impaired awareness seizures (previously classified as complex 
partial seizures) are the most common ( Chu-Shore, 2010 ); other focal and generalized seizures 
may also occur. Over 30% of patients develop treatment-refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (Jülich and Sahin, 2014). While seizures have typi[INVESTIGATOR_458558], epi[INVESTIGATOR_458571] 
(Jülich and Sahin, 2014).  
2.2.[ADDRESS_585883] Background:  Ganaxolone 
Ganaxolone (GNX) (3 α-hydroxy-3β -methyl-5 α-pregnan-20-one) is a small molecule under 
investigation for use as an ASM in rare pediat ric seizure disorders and SE. GNX is a Schedule V 
Controlled Substance in the [LOCATION_002] (US). The 50 mg/mL GNX oral suspension is approved in the US for the treatment of seizures associated with cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 
(CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) in patients 2 years of age and older. GNX is the 3β-methylated synthetic analog of allopregnanol one, an endogenous allosteric modulator of 
central nervous system (CNS) GABA
A receptors. GNX has potency and efficacy comparable to 
allopregnanolone in ac tivating synaptic and extra-synaptic GABA A receptors at a site distinct 
from benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_59684] ( Carter et al, 1997 ). GNX has protective activity in 
diverse rodent seizure models ( Reddy and Rogwski, 2012 ; Bialer et al, 2010 ). Clinical studies 
have demonstrated that GNX has anticonvulsant  activity with an acceptable safety and 
tolerability profile in the dose range of  900 to 1800 mg in adults and children 
(Sperling et al, 2017 ; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_59662], 2007 ; Kerrigan et al, 2000 ; Laxer et al, 2000 ). Further, 
GNX reduces seizures in children with IS and refractory pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. In an open-label 
(OL) study, pediatric participants aged 2 to 60 months with refractory seizures and a history of 
IS were treated with GNX doses up to 36 mg/kg for up to 3 months ( Kerrigan et al, 2000 ). A 
total of 15 participants with a history of IS co mpleted treatment; 5 of the 15 participants had a 
decrease from baseline in the number of spasms of ≥ 50%, 5 had a decrease of 25% to 50%, and 
5 had a decrease of < 25%. There was 1 participant who became spasm-free and 1 non responder 
(with a decrease of < 25%) was spasm-free from Weeks 2 to 7.  
In addition to its anticonvulsant activity, GNX ha s been shown to reduce anxiety, hyperactivity, 
and attention in children with FXS (Ligsay et al, 2016 ). Similar behavior problems occur in 
individuals with TSC, with rates of approximately 50% for attentio n deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder and autistic spectrum disorder ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014).

In the US, GNX, under the brand name [CONTACT_458682]®, is indicated for the treatment of seizures 
associated with CDKL5 deficiency  disorder (CDD) in patients 2 years of age and older. GNX is 
a Schedule V controlled substance. 
GNX is being further evaluated for use as an ASM in adolescents and adults with SE and 
pediatric and adult patients with seizures associated with TSC. 
The completed GNX clinical program comprises Phase 1 studies conducted in healthy 
participants, adults with migraine, and adults with renal impairment. Phase 2/3 studies were 
conducted in adults with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], infants and children with seizure disorders, children with FXS, 
adults with PTSD, women with [COMPANY_003], adults with migraine, adolescents, and adults with SE, and 
pediatric and adult participants with seizures associated with TSC. In these studies, the efficacy, 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokine tics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GNX were evaluated 
with an oral dosing duration ranging from 1 day up to more than 5 years, using doses from 50 to 3200 mg/day. Additionally, intravenous (IV) bolus doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg over 
durations of 2 to 5 minutes, continuous infusion of 10 to 30 mg/hour for 1 hour, or a bolus dose 
of 6 mg over 5 minutes followed with a continuous infusion of 20 mg per hour for 4 hours were 
evaluated in healthy participants. In participants with SE, IV infusions of up to 713 mg/day have been evaluated.  
As of [ADDRESS_585884] 1 dose of GNX across 
the completed studies. This includes 511 particip ants in Phase 1 and 1661 participants in 
Phase 2/3 studies. Participants who received GNX ranged in age from 4 months to 88 years.  Formulations used to date in the clinical development program are summarized and listed by 
[CONTACT_458629]’s Brochure (IB).  [IP_ADDRESS].1  TSC-related Epi[INVESTIGATOR_458572]-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], Study 1042-TSC-2001  is a Phase 2, single arm study with GNX. The 
primary objective was to assess the preliminar y safety and efficacy of GNX as adjunctive 
therapy for the treatment of seizures in participants aged 2 to 65 years with genetically or clinically confirmed TSC- related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. The core phase of the study (Part A) consisted of a 
4-week baseline followed by a treatment phase, consisting of a 4-week titration and 8-week 
maintenance period. The primary efficacy endpoi nt was the percent reduction in countable, 
TSC-associated seizures from the baseline through  the end of Period A treatment phase. Review 
of data for the primary endpoint showed a me dian 16.6% reduction in 28-day primary endpoint 
seizure frequency relative to the 4-week baseline period, with 30.4% of patients achieving a 50% 
or more seizure reduction. The CSR for the study was completed on 08 Mar 2023.

Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 48 of 175 [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety Overview 
In all completed placebo-controlled studies, 63. 5% (742/1168) of participants who received 
GNX and 51.9% (443/853) of participants who received placebo experienced at least 
1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). In these studies, the most frequently reported (ie, in 
> 5% of participants) TEAEs in GNX-treated participants were: somnolence (23.8% GNX, 7.7% 
placebo), dizziness (12.2% GNX, 3.5% placebo), fatigue (11.2% GNX, 4.8% placebo), and 
headache (6.3% GNX, 6.9% placebo). All thes e events, except headache, occurred more 
frequently in GNX-treated participants than placebo participants. CNS-related events appeared to be dose related, with the majority of these events occurring at doses ≥ 500 mg and were non-
serious, mild to moderate in severity, and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. These 
TEAEs were also anticipated based on the mechanism of action of GNX.  
In all completed placebo-controlled studies, the in cidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was 
balanced between the GNX-treated participan ts (33/1168 participants, 2.8%) and placebo 
participants (26/853 participants, 3.0%), respectiv ely. In these studies, the only SAEs reported in 
more than 1 participant in the GNX treatme nt group were seizure and sedation.  
In all completed studies, including OL, long-term follow-up studies, 5.4% 
(118/2172 participants) of participants who received GNX experienced at least [ADDRESS_585885] frequently reported SAEs (ie, in > 2 participants) were seizure, SE, IS, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], pneumonia, pneumonia aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pyrexia, seizure cluster, , dehydration, 
gastro-esophageal reflux disease, rash, somnolence,  and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. In all 
studies, most of the SAEs were considered unrelated to treatment according to the investigator, 
and most resolved.  
The Phase 2 study (protocol 1042-TSC-2001) showed a consistent safety profile in a pure TSC 
population. Of the 24 patients screened, 4 discon tinued the study due to adverse events (AEs). 
Somnolence, sedation, and fatigue were the most common treatment emergent AEs.  
Additional information describing the safety of GNX may be found in the current IB.  
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment 
Based on clinical and non-clinical data from st udies with GNX, the overall benefit/risk profile 
favors clinical development of GNX for th e treatment of TSC-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of GNX may be found in the IB.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 49 of 175 2.3.1 Risk Assessment 
CNS-related effects (such as somnolence and sedation) have been identified as an important risk related to the mechanism of action of GNX. In placebo-controlled studies the most common 
CNS effects were somnolence, dizziness, sedation,  and gait disturbance. Of the AEs present at 
frequency > 1% and 2 times the frequency of placebo in the aggregate AE data, 12/[ADDRESS_585886] common CNS-related AEs that led to discontinuation reported 
in placebo-controlled studies were dizziness (GNX 1.1%; placebo 0.4%); somnolence (GNX 
0.9%; placebo 0.4%); and fatigue (GNX 0.8%; placebo 0.1%). These CNS effects were typi[INVESTIGATOR_458573]-serious, mild to moderate in severity, and di d not lead to discontinuation of treatment.  
Unblinded safety data will be reviewed on an  ongoing basis by [CONTACT_458630] (DMC) who will monitor safety and safeguard the interests of study participants.  
The dose titration phase included in this study will minimize risk to participants from 
CNS-related effects as well as other treatment-related AEs.  
The safety assessments to be performed in this study including clinical laboratory tests, vital 
signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), phys ical and neurological examinations, AE 
assessments, Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and Tanner staging. These are 
all standard evaluations to ensure partic ipant safety in this clinical study.  
2.3.[ADDRESS_585887] the option to continue GNX treatment in the Open-label extension (OLE) study for up to an 
additional 3 years.  
2.3.3 Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion 
Taking into account the measures to minimize risk to study participants, the potential risks 
associated with GNX are justified by [CONTACT_458631]-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].

CONFIDENTIAL Page 55 of 175 4.1.2 Number of Participants  
Approximately 200 participants with TSC will be screened with the aim of randomizing 
approximately 128 participants (64 per arm), aged 1 to 65 years (2 – 65 for EU, MENA, and OC) 
(inclusive). Participants will be randomized (1:1 ) to either GNX or placebo as adjunctive therapy 
with their standard anti-seizure medication (ASMs).  
Note: Enrolled means the participant, or their LAR(s), has agreed to participate in the study 
following completion of the informed consent process and screening. Potential participants who 
are screened for the purpose of determining elig ibility for the study, but who subsequently are 
not eligible for study entry, are not considered enrolled, unless otherwise specified by [CONTACT_12695].

clinical studies in general and epi[INVESTIGATOR_458574].  
4.3 Justification for Dose 
A minimum GNX dose of 33 mg/kg/day or 900 mg/day is generally required for assessment of 
efficacy during the study. Clinical studies ha ve demonstrated that GNX has anticonvulsant 
activity with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the dose range of 900 to 1800 mg in 
adults and children ( Sperling et al, 2017 ; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_59662], 2007 ; Kerrigan et al, 2000 ; 
Laxer et al, 2000 ).  
Dosing will be based on doses that have been shown to be safe in children and adults in multiple studies with healthy volunteers and individuals with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].

This study plans to enroll participants as young as [ADDRESS_585894] of GNX (which is primarily CYP3A4/5) and CYP3A4 maturation by [CONTACT_14898] 
1 month, the dosing strategy for pediatric participants 1 to 2 years was guided by a recently 
completed population PK analysis which incorporat ed allometric principles. The similarity of 
model maximum plasma concentration (C
max) and the area under the plasma concentration-time 
curve  (AUC) with the proposed dosing regimen across a range of doses administered in previous 
clinical trials in participants 2 years of age and older coupled with the known maturation of CYP3A4 indicates that a similar exposure will be achieved in participants 1 to 2 years of age 
with the proposed dosing regimen. 
GNX (or matching volumes of placebo suspension) will be titrated at approximately weekly 
intervals over 4 weeks to a maximum dose ba sed on the participant’s starting weight 
63 mg/kg/day with a maximum daily dose of 1800 mg (for patients > 28 kg). 
In the Phase 2 data for GNX in TSC there was the suggestion of a possible interaction with CBD. 
In the trial of 23 treated patients, approximate ly half were on cannabidiol, and there was an 
association between higher CBD doses and increas ed somnolence. Given the small sample size, 
more definitive conclusions were not possible. As a result, patients taking concomitant CBD 
(Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]
®) must be monitored closely throughout this Phase 3 protocol and discussed with the 
medical monitor if AEs are seen (particularly those that are somnolence-related).  
The maximum dose for all participants is 1800 mg/day. The total double-blind phase (titration 
and maintenance periods) should not exceed 16 weeks.  
Additional dosing information can be found in Section 6.2 .

5.4 Screen Failures 
A screen failure occurs when a participant for whom informed consent/assent has been obtained is not randomized into the study and does not receive IP, regardless of reason. 
A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen 
failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials publishing 
requirements and to respond to queries from re gulatory authorities. Minimal information 
includes date of informed consent/assent, screen failure date and details, demography, eligibility 
criteria, and any SAE. 
Participant rescreening is allowed as agreed by [CONTACT_3433] e sponsor and the investigator unless there is a 
general concern for participant safety or an inab ility for the participant to become eligible (eg, 
GNX allergy, sensitivity, or exposure, non-TSC an d/or other ineligible epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], chronic 
prohibited medical condition, or treatment). Resc reened participants should be assigned a new

6.2 Dose Modification 
The protocol allows some alterations from the currently outlined dosing schedule. 
GNX (or matching volumes of placebo suspension) will be titrated at approximately weekly 
intervals over 4 weeks to a maximum dose ba sed on the participant’s starting weight 
63 mg/kg/day up to a maximum daily dose of 1800 mg (for participants > 28 kg). Any participant may have the dose of IP temporarily or permanently decreased at any point in the 
maintenance period to manage tolerability.

dose-related, AEs in clinical experience to date, are somnolence, sedation, and lethargy. If a participant experiences one of these AEs during titration (or any other event which is, in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_458576]-related), there are several potential approaches to GNX dosing to 
manage tolerability:  
1. Maintain the dose of GNX to determine whether tolerability improves w ith additional time at 
the achieved dose. 
2. Reduce the dose of GNX: 
• Reduce the amount of GNX to the midpoint between the last well-tolerated dose and dose 
producing the adverse effect(s). 
• If the intermediate dose is tolerated, after several days the participant may escalate to the 
dose that previously produced the adverse effect(s). If tolerability is acceptable, they may 
maintain at that dose or continue the titration as scheduled if not at the maximal daily dose (63 mg/kg/day or 1800 mg/day). 
• If the participant does not tolerate the re-challenge with re-escalation of the dose, they may 
return to the highest dose that was previously well-tolerated. The investigator may maintain 
that dose or may attempt re-titration,  based on their clinical judgment. 
Any adjustment in dose should be discussed with the medical monitor in advance, if possible. 
Other modifications in dose or titration may be warranted based on the participant’s clinical 
situation. Such adjustments may be instituted in consultation with the medical monitor. 
If the dose is interrupted for more than 48 hours, then the investigator should speak with the 
medical monitor regarding whether and how to re-initiate the medication.  
The maximum dose for all participants is 1800 mg/day. The total double-blind phase (titration 
and maintenance periods) should not exceed [ADDRESS_585904] been

(50 mg/mL) should be stored at room temperature (20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]; excursions 
permitted from 15°C to 30°C [59°F to 86°F]. Temperature monitoring of the IP is required at the 
storage location to ensure that the IP is mainta ined within an established temperature range. The 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study and that records are maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously 
by [CONTACT_28920]-house system, by a mechanical recording de vice such as a calibrated chart recorder, or 
by [CONTACT_3177], such that both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. Such a device (ie, certified minimum/maximum thermometer) would require  manual resetting upon each recording.  
The sponsor must be notified immediately upon di scovery of any excursion from the established 
range. Temperature excursions will require site investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the IP and will provide supportive 
documentation as necessary. Under no circumst ances should the product be dispensed to 
participants until the impact has been determined  and the product is deemed appropriate for use 
by [CONTACT_456]. 
The sponsor should be notified immediately if ther e are any changes to the storage area of the IP 
that could affect the integrity of the product(s), such as fumigation of a storage room. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_585906] Accountability 
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study IP accountability, reconciliati on, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, 
reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
Investigators will be provided with sufficient amount s of the IP to carry out this protocol for the 
agreed number of participants. The investigator  or designee will acknowledge receipt of the IP, 
documenting shipment content and condition. Accu rate records of all IP dispensed, used, 
returned, and/or destroyed must be maintained as detailed further in this section. The investigator has overall responsibility for ad ministering/dispensing IP. Where permissible, 
tasks may be delegate d to a qualified designee (eg, a pharmaci st) who is adequately trained in the 
protocol and who works under the direct supervisi on of the investigator. This delegation must be 
documented in the applicable st udy delegation of authority form.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 66 of 175 The investigator or their designee (as documente d by [CONTACT_1710]) will administer and/or dispense the IP only to participants included in this study following the procedures set out in the study protocol. Each participant will be 
given only the IP carrying his or her treatment a ssignment. All administered and/or dispensed IP 
will be documented on the electronic case report form (eCRFs) and/or other IP record. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the retrieval of all IP and study supplies from the 
participant.  
The participant’s parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) must be instructed to save and bring their unused 
IP and empty/used IP packaging to the clinic and final follow-up visit or to ship it back to the site 
via secure courier. Investigational pr oduct accountability must be assessed at the 
container/packaging level for unused IP that is contained within the original tamper-evident sealed container (eg, bottles) or at the indivi dual count level for opene d containers/packaging. 
The pharmacist/nominated person will record details on the IP accountability form. 
No IP stock or returned inventory from a Ma rinus-sponsored study may be removed from the site 
where originally shipped without prior knowledge and consent by [CONTACT_456]. If such transfer is 
authorized by [CONTACT_456], all applicable local, stat e, and national laws must  be adhered to for the

CONFIDENTIAL Page 67 of 175 6.4 Measures to Minimize Bias 
6.4.1 Randomization  
Randomization procedures to minimize bias in this randomized, double-blind study are shown below. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study using IWRS  
All participants will be centra lly assigned to randomized study intervention using an Interactive 
Web Response System (IWRS). Before the study is initiated, the log-in information and 
directions for the IWRS will be provided to each site. An IWRS will be utilized for the following 
IP tasks:  
• Randomization, stratified for current CBD use. 
• Supply management. 
• Inventory management and supply ordering. 
• Expi[INVESTIGATOR_160675]. 
• Emergency unblinding. 
An IWRS will centrally randomize participants. The randomization schedule (comprised of a kit 
list and randomization list) will be generated using standard, va lidated methods, and maintained 
by [CONTACT_458635]. The investigator will be instructed by [CONTACT_8784], which numbered bottle to use to dose a participant. The investigator and research staff will be 
aware of the ascending dose design of the clinical  investigation; however, the investigator, the 
research staff, and the participants will be blinded with respect to who is receiving active drug 
versus placebo. The maximum placebo period is [ADDRESS_585907] bottle of IP 
and distribute the bottle to the investigator or designee. 
Study medication will be dispensed at the study visits as summarized in the SOA ( Section 1.3) .  
Returned study medication should not be redispensed to the participants. [IP_ADDRESS] Participant Numbering 
During the screening visit, each participant will be assigned a unique 6-digit participant number. 
The participant number will consist of a 3-digit clinical investigationa l site number assigned by 
[CONTACT_456], followed by a 3-digit participant nu mber (eg, 001) assigned by [CONTACT_458636].

CONFIDENTIAL Page 68 of 175 capture system. This participant number will also serve as the screening number. The unique 
6-digit participant number will serve as the participant ID and be used to track the participant 
throughout the study. 
The clinical site is responsible for maintaini ng a current log of participant number assignments 
and bottle numbers of the IP administered to each  participant. The unique participant number is 
required to be entered on all clinical investig ation documentation (eCRFs,  labeling of clinical 
materials and samples containers , drug accountability logs, etc.). 
6.4.2 Blinding 
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinded Investigational Product 
This is a double-blind study in which study staff as well as study participant and caregiver(s) are 
blinded to study intervention. The contents of each bottle will be bli nded using labels with 
unique bottle numbers. 
Only the IP supplier and the sponsor’s IP manager will be unblinded as to the contents of each 
bottle of IP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Blind Break (IWRS) 
The IWRS will be programmed with blind-breakin g functionality. In case of an emergency, the 
investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants’ 
intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in 
making such a determination. 
If a participant’s intervention assignment is  unblinded, the sponsor must be notified 
within [ADDRESS_585908] be recorded. 
6.5 Study Intervention Compliance 
When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive the IP directly from the investigator or 
designee, under medical supervision. The dose of the IP and study participant identification at 
this time will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff other than 
the person administering the study intervention.   
When participants administer the IP at home, compliance with the IP will be assessed at each visit. Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_458637], with 
queries as necessary, during the site visits. Parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) are to record daily 
seizure events in addition to study medication and non-study ASM administration in the eDiary 
device daily. Parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) will be  re-educated on the importance of adhering to 
daily seizure, IP and non-study ASM recording as  needed. Deviation(s) from the prescribed 
dosage regimen should be recorded in the eCRF.

6.6 Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant medications refer to all treatment taken between the date of informed 
consent/assent and the date of the last dose of the IP.  
Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is  receiving at the time of enrollment or receives 
during the study must be recorded along with:   
• Reason for use. 
• Dates of administration including start and end dates. 
• Dosage information including dose and frequency. 
Participants must abstain from taking prescription or nonprescription drugs (including vitamins 
and dietary or herbal supplements) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme 
inducer) or 5 half-lives of the respective drug, if known (whichever is longer), before the start of 
study intervention until completion of the follow-up visit, unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_268667], the medicati on will not interfere with the study.   
Paracetamol/acetaminophen, at doses of ≤ 2 g/day, is permitted for use any time during the 
study. Other concomitant medication may be considered case -by-case by [CONTACT_67633].

6.7 Intervention After the End of the Study 
Participants may be eligible fo r continued treatment with GNX in an OLE. In the OLE, treatment 
can continue until the sponsor terminates the development of the IP in TSC or GNX has been approved and marketed in the pa rticipants’ respective country. 
7 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention 
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study 
intervention. If the IP is discontinued at any time, participants should follow the 2-week taper 
schedule unless otherwise medica lly indicated. If the participant discontinues during the 
maintenance period, evaluations listed for the Early Termination Visit (Visit 12;  Table 1 ) are to 
be performed as completely as possible along with the end of study and safety follow-up 
assessment, as appropriate. Comments (spontaneous or elicited) or complaints made by [CONTACT_458639]. The reason for termination, date of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_458580], and total amount of the IP taken must be recorded in the eCRF and source documents. Discontinuation of the IP due to AEs mu st also be reflected on the AE eCRF page. 
Participants who discontinue IP should undergo a 2- week or shorter taper period, as clinically 
indicated. These participants will have a visit 2 weeks after the end of taper to complete the 
safety follow-up assessments.  
See the SOA ( Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study 
intervention and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
The reason for early discontinuation of the IP must be determined by [CONTACT_458640]’s source documents and on the eCRF. If a participant is withdrawn for 
more than [ADDRESS_585914] 
clinically relevant reason should be entered on the eCRF.  
Reasons for early termination include but are not limited to the following:  
• AE (including pregnancy). 
• Protocol violation/pr otocol deviation. 
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_66125](s)/LAR(s). 
• Lost to follow-up. 
• Lack of efficacy. 
• Death. 
• Investigator decision.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 72 of 175 7.2 Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study 
All participants or his/her parent(s)/LAR(s) reserve the right to withdraw from the study at any time, as stated in the informed consent/assent form. The investigator may discontinue participants from the clinical study for any of the following reasons:  
• Participant is found to have entered the study in violation of the protocol. 
• Participant requires the use of a disallowed concomitant medication. 
• Participant’s condition changes after entering the clinical investigation so that the participant 
no longer meets the inclusion criteria or de velops any of the exclusion criteria. 
• Participant or parent(s)/LAR(s) withdraws cons ent or assent to participate in the study. 
• Participant is noncompliant  with the procedures set forth in the protocol. 
• Participant experiences an AE/SAE that warrants withdrawal from the study.  
• Any laboratory, medical, or clinical finding for which clinical intervention should take precedence over study participation. This includes: 
o AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT > 3 × ULN. 
o Total bilirubin levels > 1.5 × ULN. 
o eGFR < 30 mL/min. 
• It is the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_458581]’s best interest to continue in the 
study. 
Decisions to discontinue the study will be made at  each participating site by [CONTACT_093]. If 
feasible, the reason for discontinuation should be discussed with the sponsor’s medical monitor 
prior to participant’s discontinuation. Participan ts who discontinue the IP during the maintenance 
period will continue to record daily seizure frequency at minimum until the completion of the 
maintenance period.  
At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an Early Termination Visit (Visit 12) 
should be conducted as shown in the SOA ( Section 1.3 ). At this visit, participants will start a 
2-week taper and then return to the site 2 w eeks later for safety follow-up assessments.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.   
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records.

study visit:  
• The site must attempt to cont act the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible, counsel the participant on the importa nce of maintaining the assigned visit schedule 
and ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635]. A minimum of [ADDRESS_585917] (office visit or telephone contact ). At least [ADDRESS_585918] include a written communication sent to th e participant’s last know n address via courier 
or mail (with an acknowledgment of receipt request) asking that they return to the site for 
final safety evaluations and return any unused IP. If contact [CONTACT_458642] r the early termination and final safety follow-up 
visit, it should be documented in the eCRF. 
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.  
Discontinuation of specific sites or of  the study as a whole are handled in Section 10.1.10 . 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SOA (see Section 1.3 ). Study dates will 
be based on the date of the first dose of IP an d not the date of screening or baseline visits. 
Study assessments can be conducted at the institution of the site investigator or remotely at the 
participant’s home. All assessments can be conduc ted remotely with the use of telemedicine 
video tools; and for sites located outside of the European Union only, by [CONTACT_458643], draw bl ood samples, and collect specimens. 
Immediate safety concerns should be discusse d with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, includ ing those specified in the SOA, is essential 
and required for study conduct.  All screening evaluations must be completed and re viewed to confirm that potential participants 
meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
participants screened and to confirm eligibility  or record reasons for screening failure, as 
applicable.  
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’ s routine clinical manage ment (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of the informed consen t form (ICF) may be utilized for screening or 
baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were 
performed within the timeframe defined in the SOA.

8.1 General Study Periods 
8.1.1 Screening, Enrollment, Randomization, and Baseline 
Potential participants w ill be pre-identified by [CONTACT_59742] a previous TSC diagnosis 
based on clinical features and/or results and those still experience refractory 
seizures. 
The process of identification of participants is pe rformed by [CONTACT_093]. If an investigator is 
seeing a patient with TSC in their clinic who is having 8 or more seizures per month, they will 
make a judgment regarding whether the benefits of  clinical trial partic ipation may outweigh the 
risks of clinical trial participation (with any alternative treatments taken into consideration). If the clinician feels that they do, then they will explain the study to the participant (or LAR). If the 
participant/LAR is fully informed and provides consent, then this will be documented, and the 
screening activities can begin. 
Note for Investigational Site s in the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]): National Health Services (NHS) 
sites in the [LOCATION_006] will be aware of the study by [CONTACT_458644], and being trained on the st udy design, conduct, and participant protection 
policies. 
Informed consent/assent will be obtained afte r the study has been fully explained to the 
participant/parent(s)/LAR(s) and before the conduct  of any screening procedures or assessments 
(see Section 10.1.3  for the informed consent procedure). This includes the collection of historical 
seizure frequency data, or if this information is not available from medical records, the 
participants will be asked to provide this inform ation for the 8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit 
based on their own recall/records. This Screen ing Visit will occur 4 weeks before baseline 
(Week 0).  
At screening, informed consent will be confirmed and the participants eligibility checked. 
Demographics and Medical history in cluding prior treatment information ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), 
historical seizure calendar review ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), and a seizure identif ication and diagnostic 
review ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be performed as well as other study specific procedures as outlined 
in the SOA ( Table 1 ). 
Randomization will occur approximately 4 weeks after screening at baseline and all participants 
will be centrally assigned to randomized study inte rvention (stratified for current CBD use) using 
an IWRS. Details are provided in Section 6.4.1 .

CONFIDENTIAL Page 75 of 175 [IP_ADDRESS] Demographics and Medical History 
Demographics including age, gender, ethnicity, and race will be collected, as allowed according to local regulations. In addition to the genetic  evaluation of pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
TSC1/TSC2 variant, relevant medical history including but limited to the age of seizure onset, other physical disabilities such as scoliosis, visual impairment, sensory problems, and 
gastrointestinal difficulties will also be assessed. The participant’s developmental history will 
also be assessed. This will include the grade level of school work that the participant has 
completed (for individuals who are chronologically school age), as well as the investigator’s estimate of the participant’s developmental age. Prior medications include all treatment, 
including but not limited to herbal treatments, vitamins, surgical implants (such as VNS), and 
prescribed medications received within 30 days (or PK equivalent of 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) of the date prior to screening.  
Demographics and Medical History will be reviewed and collected at the Visit 1 (screening). A 
review of the participant’s Medical History will be performed again at Visit 2 (baseline). All 
findings on the medical history will be recorded on the eCRF. Prior treatment information 
(therapy name, start and stop date),  if available, must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Historical Seizure Calendar Review 
A 2-month (8-week) daily historical seizure calendar will be reviewed at the screening visit to determine eligibility per inclusion/exclusion cr iteria. Acceptable daily historical seizure 
calendars will need to denote seizure types (or sufficient description), frequency, and days that 
no seizures occurred.  
Procedures specific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard of care, will not be 
performed until written informed consent/assent from the participant/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) has been appropriately obtained. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Seizure Identification and Diagnostic Review 
Per the inclusion criteria, enrollment into the study will be based on the presence and frequency 
of the primary endpoint seizure types.  
Primary endpoint seizure types are defined as the following: focal motor seizures without 
impairment of consciousness or awareness, focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or 
awareness with motor features, focal seizures evolving to bilateral, tonic-clonic convulsive 
seizures, and generalized motor seizures including tonic-clonic, bilateral t onic, bilateral clonic, 
or atonic/drop seizures. Seizures must have a motor component sufficiently prominent and 
distinct to clearly establish the observed symptoms as epi[INVESTIGATOR_458582]. Seizures that do not 
count towards the primary endpoint include: focal or  generalized nonmotor seizures  (eg, absence 
seizures or focal nonmotor seizures with or without impairment of awareness), infantile or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_59666], and myoclonic seizures.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 77 of 175 8.2 Efficacy Assessments 
Efficacy as determined by a reduction in seizures  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_458645], duration, and frequency in a seizure eDiary. Days in which no seizures occur will also be 
noted. CGI-CSID and CGI-I, as well as changes in behavior and neuropsychiatric symptoms will 
be assessed by a variety of clinician and caregiver administered instruments.  
Planned timepoints for all efficacy asse ssments are provided in the SOA (see Section 1.3 ). 
8.2.1 Seizure Type and Frequency 
The Epi[INVESTIGATOR_458585]. This categorization of seizure type by [CONTACT_59743][INVESTIGATOR_458586]’s entry into th e study as this will be determined by [CONTACT_1275]’s assessment of eligibility.  
Parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) will record daily se izures denoting vernacular name [CONTACT_458684], duration, and frequency in an eDiary.  Primary endpoint seizure types w ill be counted towards the primary endpoint. These are defined 
as the following:  
• Focal motor seizures without impairment of consciousness or awareness. 
• Focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or awareness with motor features. 
• Focal seizures evolving to bilatera l, tonic-clonic convulsive seizures. 
• Generalized motor seizures including tonic-clonic, bilateral tonic, bilateral clonic, or 
atonic/drop seizures.  
Seizures must have a motor com ponent sufficiently prominent and distinct to clearly establish 
the observed symptoms as epi[INVESTIGATOR_458582].  
Seizures that do not count  towards the primary endpoint include:  
• Focal or generalized nonmotor seizures (eg, abse nce seizures or focal nonmotor seizures with 
or without impairment of awareness). 
• Infantile or epi[INVESTIGATOR_59666]. 
• Myoclonic seizures.

Participants or parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) are to record administration of the IP and 
background ASMs in the eDiary. Compliance with  the IP treatment will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_458648]’ eDiary and retu rned supplies with queries, as necessary. 
8.2.2 Clinical Global Impression – Severity 
The CGI-S is a 7-point Likert scale that will be completed by [CONTACT_458649], relative to ot her individuals with TSC. This should take into 
account overall seizure control, behavior, sa fety, tolerability of medications, and any 
involvement of non-neurological organ systems. The participant will be rated as follows: 1 – Normal, not at all a problem, 2 – Border line problem, 3 – Mild problem, 4 – Moderate 
problem, 5 – Marked problem, 6 – Severe problem, 7 – Very severe problem (see Section 10.9 ).  
CGI-S will be assessed at the baseline (Visit 2). 
8.2.3 Clinical Global Impre ssion – Improvement  
The CGI-I is a 7-point Likert scale that the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and clinician uses to 
rate the change in overall seizure control, behavior, safety, and tolerability after initiation of the 
IP relative to baseline (prior to treatment with th e IP). The participant will be rated as follows: 
1
 – very much improved, 2 – much improved, 3 – minimally improved, 4 – no change, 
5 – minimally worse, 6 – much worse, and 7 – very much worse (See Section 10.10 ). 
CGI-I (parent[s]/caregiver[s]/LAR[s] and clinician) will be assessed at Visit 4 (Week 1), 
Visit 8 (Week 5), Visit 9 (Week 9), and Visit 12 (Week 16). 
Participants who continue in the OLE will also have the CGI-I conducted at Visit 15 (Week 18) 
and Visit 17 (Week 20). 
8.2.4 Caregiver Global Impression of Change in Seizure Intensity/Duration  
The CGI-CSID is a 7-point Likert scale in which the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) assesses 
change in seizure intensity and/or duration after initiation of IP relative to baseline (prior to 
treatment with IP). The scale ranges from 1-  very much improved, 2- much improved, 
3- minimally improved, 4- no change, 5- minimall y worse, 6- much worse, and 7- very much 
worse (See  Section 10.11 ). 
CGI-CSID will be assessed at Visit 4 (Week 1), Visit 8 (Week 5), Visit 9 (Week 9), and

CONFIDENTIAL Page 83 of 175 8.3.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests 
Laboratory safety assessments will be collected to  monitor participant safety. Clinical laboratory 
tests are listed in Section 10.2  and will be collected per the schedule listed in SOA (see 
Section 1.3 ). The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents.  
These clinical laboratory assessments will in clude complete blood c ount with automated 
differential, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and eGFR calculation (mL/min), comprehensive metabolic panel, as well serum pregnancy test for all WOCBP (at Visits 1 and 2 in the 
double-blind phase and Visit 17 for participants co ntinuing in OLE). A central laboratory will be 
utilized by [CONTACT_30107]. 
The following liver function and eGFR tests will be monitored throughout the study as follows:  
• If AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) increases > [ADDRESS_585927] during the study, participant 
should be followed with weekly laboratory repeat  testing and continue in study if levels 
trending down. Participant will be  discontinued if levels do not decline to under 3 × ULN.  
• If total bilirubin increases to 1.5 × ULN or more during study, the participant will be 
discontinued.  
• Participants with significant renal insufficiency, eGFR < 30 mL/min (calculated using the 
Cockcroft-Gault formula or pediatric GFR calculator or Bedside Schwartz), will be 
discontinued if the criterion is met post baseline. 
• If any of the criteria above are deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_093], then the sponsor’s medical monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
• If clinically significant values do not return to  normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by [CONTACT_093], the etiology s hould be identified, and the sponsor notified. 
• If laboratory values from non-protocol-speci fied laboratory tests performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093] (eg, SAE or Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade [ADDRESS_585928]), then the results must be recorded and 
discussed with the medical monitor. 
Samples will be collected for clinical laboratory tests at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (baseline), Visit 4 (Week 1), Visit 8 (Week 5), Visit 9 (Week 9), and Visit 12 (Week 16).  
In addition, urinalysis will be conducted at Vi sit 1 (screening) or Visit 2 (baseline), Visit 
4 (Week 1), and Visit 12 (Week 16) for all participants.  Participants who continue in the OLE will also have clinical laboratory tests and urinalysis 
conducted at Visit 17 (Week 20). The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study, 
including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 60 mL. Repeat or 
unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reas ons or for technical issues with the samples, 
which may increase the total volume drawn.

recommended blood volume limits are not unnecessarily exceeded. 
8.3.5 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring (Columbia-Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale) 
GNX is considered to be a CNS-active intervention. GNX is related to products with an 
increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior. Participants with TSC may occasionally develop suicidal ideation or behavior. 
Participants being treated with GNX should be mo nitored appropriately and observed closely for 
suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) or any other unusual changes in behavior, especially at the 
beginning and end of the course of intervention, or  at the time of dose changes, either increases 
or decreases. Participants who experience signs  of SIB should undergo a risk assessment. All 
factors contributing to SIB should be evalua ted and consideration should be given to 
discontinuation of the study intervention.  When informed consent or assent has been give n, participants or parents/caregivers/LARs of 
participants being treated with GNX should be aler ted about the need to monitor participants for 
the emergence of unusual changes in behavior, as  well as the emergence of SIB and to report 
such symptoms immediately to the study investigator. C-SSRS will be used to rate the participant’s degree of suicidal ideation on a scale ranging from 
“no suicidal ideation” to “active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent” 
(Posner et al, 2011 ) (See Section 10.17 ). The C-SSRS will be assessed in all 
participants ≥ 11 years of age, if appropriate, otherwise, clinical judgment will be used.  
If the participant has a positive result for C-SSR S, the medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_380837] 24 hours and the medical monitor will de termine if the individual should discontinue the 
trial.  
The C-SSRS (baseline form) will be completed at Visit 2 (baseline), while the C-SSRS (since 
previous visit) will be completed at Visit 4 (Week 1), Visit 8 (Week 5), Visit 9 (Week 9), and 
Visit 12 (Week 16). Participants who do not cont inue in the OLE will have their final C-SSRS 
assessment at their end of study visit, Visit 13A, on Week 20.  
Participants who continue in the OLE will also have the C-SSRS conducted at 
Visit 15 (Week 18) and Visit 17 (Week 20).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 87 of 175 8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information 
All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent/assent is signed until the defined 
follow-up period at the timepoints specified in the SOA ( Section 10.3 ). This includes events 
occurring during the screening period of the study, regardless of whether or not the IP has been administered. All AEs reported after the initiation of the IP will be considered TEAEs. Where 
possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of symptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not 
been made, then each symptom should be listed individually. All AEs should be captured on the 
appropriate AE pages in the eCRF and in source documents. In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the IP indication s hould also be captured on the AE eCRF page. 
All AEs must be followed to closure (the participan t’s health has returned to baseline status or all 
variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the participant is still participating in the study. Closure indicates that an outcome is r eached, stabilization is achieved (the investigator 
does not expect any further improvement or worsen ing of the event), or the event is otherwise 
explained. When appropriate, medi cal tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of 
event(s) can be documented. 
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study) are collected from the time the 
participant/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) signs the informed consent/assent until the defined 
follow-up period stated and must be reported to Marinus’ drug safety vendor within [ADDRESS_585935] awareness of the event.  
In addition, any SAE considered “related” to the IP and discovered by [CONTACT_458652]’ drug safety vendor within 
[ADDRESS_585936] awareness of the event. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs after conclusion of 
the study participation. However, if the investigat or learns of any SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. 
8.4.2 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and tran smitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.4 . 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when  detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.

Section 8.4.8 ) will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or 
the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3 ). Further information on follow-up 
procedures is provided in Section 10.[ADDRESS_585937]/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC), 
and investigators. 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs ) from the sponsor will review and then file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
A S[LOCATION_003]R is defined as an SAE that meets both the following criteria with respect to IP: Suspected — is assessed as related to IP Unexpected — compared to the IP-related AEs described in the IB, Reference Safety 
Information, the event meets any of the following criteria: 
• The event has not been previously described. 
• The event is now characterized as more severe. 
• The event is now characterized more specifically (eg, an event of “interstitial nephritis” in a 
participant receiving an agent previously described as associated with “acute renal failure”). 
In clinical trials involving ill participants, events  considered related to the natural history of the 
disease under study or to lack of efficacy (that is, the event is considered more likely related to 
those factors than to other factors, including  study drug) are not considered “unexpected”.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 89 of 175 Requirements for Expedited and Periodic Reporting of Adverse Events: 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs are required to be reported rapi[INVESTIGATOR_458590]/IECs (within 
7 days of initial notification for fatal or life-th reatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs; within 15 days for all other 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs). Therefore, as with all SAEs, the site must report the event to the Marinus’ drug safety 
vendor within 24 hours of being made aware of th e event. The Sponsor and the Investigator will 
work together to meet these reporting requirements. 
8.4.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations 
A change in the value of a clinical laboratory, vital sign, 12-lead ECG assessment can represent 
an AE if the change is clinically significant or if, during treatment with the IP, a shift of a 
parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or there is a further worsening 
of an already abnormal value. When evaluating su ch changes, the extent of deviation from the 
reference range, the duration until return to the reference range (either while continuing 
treatment or after the end of treatment with the IP), and the range of variation of the respective 
parameter within its reference range must be taken into consideration. 
If, at the end of the double-blind treatment phase , there are abnormal clinical laboratory, vital 
sign, or 12-lead ECG values that were not present in the pretreatment findings observed closest to the start of study treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return 
to within the reference range or until a plausibl e explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found 
for the abnormal values. 
The investigator should decide, based on the a bove criteria and the clinical condition of a 
participant, whether a change in a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or the 12-lead ECG parameter is 
clinically significant and therefore, represents an AE. 
8.4.6 Death Events 
Any SAE that results in the participant’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary cause of 
death) must have fatal checked as an outcome, with the date of death recorded as the resolution 
date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the participant’s 
death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. 
For any SAE that results in the participant’s d eath or any ongoing events at the time of death, 
unless another IP action was previously take n (eg, the drug was interrupted, reduced, or 
withdrawn), the action taken with the IP should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not 
applicable” (if the participant never received the IP). The IP action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solely as a result of the participant’s death. 
8.4.7 Disease-related Events and/or Disease- related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events 
Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classified as AEs as long as they are within 
the normal day-to-day fluctuation or expected pr ogression of the disease. This includes seizures

CONFIDENTIAL Page 90 of 175 typi[INVESTIGATOR_458591], frequency, or duration. 
Significant worsening of the symptoms should be recorded as an AE. 
The following disease-related events are common in participants with epi[INVESTIGATOR_458592]/life threatening:  
• Seizures. 
• SE. 
• Falls/trauma/accidents. 
As these events are typi[INVESTIGATOR_103659], they will not be reported 
according to the standard process for expedite d reporting of SAEs even though the event may 
meet the definition of an SAE. These events will be recorded within 5 business days of when 
they are reported to the site. These disease-related events will be monitored by [CONTACT_105271] a routine basis. See Section 10.1.6 . 
Note: However, if either of the following conditions applies, then the event must be recorded and reported as an AE/SAE (instead of a disease-related event):  
• The event is, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], of greater intensity, frequency, or duration than 
expected for the individual participant, or 
• The investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event was related to study intervention. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_585938] (AESI) includes any non-serious condition that falls under 
the system organ class (SOC) of ‘Breast and Reproductive disorders’. These AESIs will be 
submitted to Marinus’ drug safety vendor using the study specific AESI reporting form.

up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Marinus medical monitor using the details specified in 
the emergency contact [CONTACT_59747]. The pregnant female 
study participant must be withdrawn from the study. 
Every effort should be made to gather info rmation regarding the pregnancy outcome and 
condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 
30 calendar days after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar days after delivery.

8.4.10  Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error 
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication erro r should not be reported per the SAE reporting 
procedure. Only a resulting AE, if it occurs, should be reported according to the procedures as 
described in Section 10.4 . All IP provided to pediatric participants should be supervised by [CONTACT_31588](s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s). 
The definitions below are not mutually exclusive; an event can meet more than 1 category. 
• Abuse:  Persistent or sporadic inte ntional intake of an IP for a nonmedical purpose (eg, to 
alter one’s state of consciousness or get high ) in a manner that may be detrimental to the 
individual and/or society. 
• Misuse: Intentional use of an IP other than as dire cted or indicated at any dose. (Note: This 
includes a situation in which the IP is not used as directed at the dose prescribed by [CONTACT_12695].) 
• Overdose: Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of an IP exceeding a prespecified 
total daily dose of the product.  
• Medication error:  An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administering, and/or use of an 
IP. For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below. 
o Cases of participant’s missing doses of the IP are not considered reportable as medication errors.

For this study, any dose of GNX greater than up to 63 mg/kg/day or over the maximum of 
1800 mg/day within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose. 
Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose, but participants should be 
closely monitored and receive supportive care.  
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should:  
• Contact [CONTACT_10990]. 
• Evaluate the participant to determine, in consultation with the medical monitor, whether 
study intervention should be interrupted or whether the dose should be reduced. 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and provide any appropriate supportive medical management. 
• Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within [ADDRESS_585941] dose of study 
intervention if requested by [CONTACT_7195] (determined on a case-by-case basis). 
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the

CONFIDENTIAL Page 94 of 175 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to database lock and it will include a more technical and detailed description of the statis tical analyses described in this section. This 
section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints 
including primary and ke y secondary endpoints. 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
® (SAS Institute, Cary, NC [ZIP_CODE]) software. 
9.1 Statistical Hypotheses 
Hypothesis testing will be perform ed for the primary endpoint: the percentage change in 28-day 
primary endpoint seizure frequency during the double-blind phase relative to the baseline, based 
on the primary endpoint seizure types. Summary statistics including confidence intervals for the 
treatment differences will be used to su mmarize the results. The hypothesis testing is: 
Ho: θ PBO = θ GNX  H a: θ PBO ≠ θ GNX 
where θGNX is the percentage change of seizure frequency relative to the baseline for participants 
who treated with GNX and θPBO is similarly defined for participants receiving placebo.  
9.1.1 Multiplicity Adjustment 
All endpoints will be assessed descriptively, by [CONTACT_458653], with point estimates and 95% confid ence intervals. The primary and secondary 
endpoints will be assessed in an inferential manner. Multiplicity control will be used for the 
primary and secondary endpoints. A gate keepi [INVESTIGATOR_458593]-I error rate. There is a single prima ry efficacy endpoint, and formal hypothesis testing 
will be performed for this endpoint first. If the null hypothesis is rejected for the primary efficacy 
endpoint at the 2-sided α-level allocated to the final analysis of the primary endpoint, then 
statistical hypothesis testing w ill be performed on the 4 key secondary endpoints. The testing 
will stop if the result is non-statistically signifi cant. All other non-key secondary and

CONFIDENTIAL Page 95 of 175 9.2 Analysis Sets 
For the purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets are defined:  
Participant Analysis Set Description 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) set All randomized participants. Participants will be summarized 
within the treatment group to which they were randomized. This population will be used for efficacy analyses. 
Modified Intent-to-treat (mITT) set All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of the IP. Participants will be summa rized within the treatment group 
to which they were randomized. This population will be used 
for sensitivity analysis for effi cacy. 
Per-protocol (PP) set All participants in the ITT analysis set participants who received 
IP for at least [ADDRESS_585942] the efficacy e ndpoints (defined prior to database lock). 
Safety analysis set All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of the 
IP. Participants will be summa rized within the treatment group 
for which they actually received treatment. This population will be used for the safety analyses. 
IP = investigational product. 
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set is used  to analyze endpoints related to the efficacy 
objectives and the safety analysis set is used to  analyze the endpoints and assessments related to 
safety. The primary analysis will be performed within the ITT population; a supportive analysis 
in the per-protocol (PP) and modified intent-t o-treat (mITT) population will also be conducted. 
9.3 Statistical Analyses 
9.3.1 General Considerations 
The results of the primary, secondary, and explor atory endpoints will be summarized separately. 
The results will be summarized by [CONTACT_458654]. Participant demographics, characteristics, a nd medical history at randomization will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. 
The primary and secondary endpoints (unless otherwise defined) for the
 Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) will be based on the double-blind phase (titra tion and maintenance 
period).  
The primary and secondary endpoints (unless othe rwise defined) for the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) will be based on the maintenance period only.

Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 96 of 175 9.3.2 Primary Endpoint(s) 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percenta ge change from baseline in 28-day primary 
endpoint seizure frequency during the double-bli nd phase (FDA). For the EMA, this endpoint 
will be evaluated over the maintenance period only. 
Primary endpoint seizure types are defined as the following:  
• Focal motor seizures without impairment of consciousness or awareness 
• Focal seizures with impairment of consci ousness or awareness with motor features 
• Focal seizures evolving to bilatera l, tonic-clonic convulsive seizures 
• Generalized motor seizures including tonic-clonic, bilateral tonic, bilateral clonic, or 
atonic/drop seizures.   
Seizures that do not count towards the primary endpoint include:  
• Focal or generalized nonmotor seizures (eg, abse nce seizures or focal nonmotor seizures with 
or without impairment of awareness) 
• Infantile or epi[INVESTIGATOR_59666] 
• Myoclonic seizures. 
Post-baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of seizures in the 
double-blind phase divided by [CONTACT_7459] w ith seizure data in the period, multiplied by 
28. Baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of seizures in the 
baseline phase divided by [CONTACT_59756], multiplied by 28. 
The calculation for percent change from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency will be done as 
follows for each participant:  
 
The baseline, post-baseline, and arithmetic and percent changes from baseline in 28-day seizure 
frequency will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
The difference between the treatment groups in the percent changes will be tested for statistical 
significance. Since the percent differences are anticipated to display skewness and/or outliers, the 
test will be performed using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum statistic us ing a 2-sided significance level 
of 0.05.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 97 of 175 [IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity Analysis 
There are 5 sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint planned and these will be 
performed as outlined in the SAP:  
• For the first sensitivity analysis, intermittent (random/sporadic) missing data during the 
double-blind phase and any missing data during the baseline phase will be assumed missing 
completely at random and the collected data will be used to calculate the 28-day seizure 
frequencies. 
• The second sensitivity analysis is to explore the possibility that participants who stop 
recording their seizure counts tend to have higher counts than the other participants. 
• The third sensitivity analysis will be performed on participants who achieved their 
maintenance dose at the start of the maintenance period. This analysis will exclude those 
participants who are still titrated continuously during maintenance period. 
• The fourth sensitivity analysis will be performed for the primary outcome measure by [CONTACT_458615]. 
• The fifth sensitivity analysis will be performed for the primary outcome measure by [CONTACT_458616]. 
9.3.3 Secondary Endpoint(s) Analysis 
All secondary and will compare GNX and placebo at the end of the 
double-blind phase and maintenan ce period relative to the 4-week prospective baseline phase. 
The primary analyses of all secondary and will be performed on the ITT 
population. All the endpoints will be included in data listings. 
The key secondary endpoints are:  
• Percentage change from baselin e in 28-day primary endpoint seizure frequency during the 
maintenance period (FDA). For the EM A this is the primary endpoint. 
• Number (%) of participants considered tr eatment responders during the double-blind phase 
(FDA). For the EMA, this endpoint will be evaluated over the maintenance period only. 
Treatment responders are defined as those participants with ≥  50% reduction from baseline in 
primary endpoint seizure frequency during given period. 
• Number (%) of participants considered trea tment responders during the maintenance period. 
Treatment responders are defined as those participants with ≥  50% reduction from baseline in 
primary endpoint seizure frequency during a given period. 
• CGI-I at the last scheduled visit in the double-blind phase. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy: Behavioral/Neuropsychiatric/Quality of Life 
Secondary efficacy endpoints in be havior, neuropsychiatric, and quality of life domains are:  
• Change from baseline in ADAMS total score and sub-score. 
• Change from baseline in quality-of-life scales: SF-36, Peds-QL-FIM, and ELDQOL.

EMA, this endpoint will be evaluate d over the maintenance period only.  
• Participants with a ≥ 25% and ≥ 75% reduction from baseline in primary endpoint seizure 
frequency during the double-blind phase (FDA). For the EMA, this endpoint will be evaluated over the maintenance period only. 
• Participants with a ≥ 25%, ≥  50%, and ≥ 75% reduction from baseline in primary endpoint 
seizure frequency during the maintenance period. 
• Responder analysis for primary endpoint seizur es and all seizures during the double-blind 
phase using the following response categories: ≤ 0%, > 0% to < 25%, ≥ 25% to < 50%, 
≥ 50% to < 75%, and ≥ 75% to 100% (FDA). For the EMA, this endpoint will be evaluated 
over the maintenance period only. 
• Percent change in 28-day fr equency of all seizures.  
• Change from baseline in the percentage of se izure-free days, based on all seizure types.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 104 of 175 Guidance on completion of CRFs will be provided in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. 
The investigator’s authorized site personnel must enter the information required by [CONTACT_59751]. A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and 
review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy. Discrepancies 
between source data and data entered on the e CRF will be addressed by [CONTACT_1746]. 
When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by [CONTACT_59752]. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit 
and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Once a participant is screened, it is expected that site 
personnel will complete the e CRF entry within approximately 7 business days of the 
participant’s visit. 
The participant’s parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) must enter the information required by [CONTACT_458658]. A study monitor will revi ew all seizure eDiary entries in accordance with 
the monitoring plan for completeness and accu racy. Discrepancies w ill be addressed by [CONTACT_32346]’ parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and qu alified site personnel. Wh en a data discrepancy 
warrants correction, the correction will be made by [CONTACT_2299]’s parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and authorized site  personnel. Data collec tion procedures will be 
discussed with the site at the site initiation vis it and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Once the 
participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) signs informed consent/assent, it is expected that all diary entries 
will be made daily a nd no longer than [ADDRESS_585947] permit study-related mon itoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. 
Quality tolerance limit(s) (QTL[s]) will be predefined in the IB to identify systematic issues that 
can impact participant safety and/or reliability of  study results. These predefined parameters will 
be monitored during the study, and important de viations from the QTLs and remedial actions 
taken will be summarized in the CSR. Monitoring details describing strategy, including definition of study critical data items and 
processes (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality such as risk management and 
mitigation strategies and analytical risk-bas ed monitoring), methods, responsibilities, and 
requirements, including handling of noncomplianc e issues and monitoring techniques (central, 
remote, or on-site monitoring) are provided in the monitoring plan. 
The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of th is study, including quality 
checking of the data. The sponsor assumes accountability for actions dele gated to other individuals (eg, contract 
research organizations). Data will be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO data management plan. 
Quality control and data validation procedures will be applied to ensure the validity and accuracy 
of the clinical database.

10.1.9  Source Documents 
Source documents provide evidence for the existe nce of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site. Data reported on the CRF or entered in the e CRF that are transcribed from source documents 
must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The 
investigator may need to request previous medical  records or transfer records, depending on the 
study. Also, current medical records must be available. The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF. 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data veri fication to confirm that data entered into 
the CRF by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source 
documents; that the safety and rights of particip ants are being protected; and that the study is 
being conducted in accordance with the curren tly approved protocol and any other study

CONFIDENTIAL Page 106 of 175 [IP_ADDRESS] Study/Site Termination 
The sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. The decision to terminate a study may 
be for administrative or safety reasons. A decision to terminate for safety reasons may be driven 
by [CONTACT_458659] y influences the risk/benefit assessment. Study 
sites will be closed upon study completion. A study s ite is considered closed when all required 
documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been 
performed. 
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in a dvance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_277488]:  
For study termination:  
• Discontinuation of further study intervention development. 
For site termination:  • Failure of the investigator to comply with th e protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or 
local health authorities, the sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines. 
• Inadequate or no recruitment (evaluated after a reasonable amount of time) of participants by 
[CONTACT_093]. Total number of participants included earlier than expected. 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory author ities, and any contract research organization(s) 
used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by [CONTACT_1214]. The investigator shall pr omptly inform the participant and should assure 
appropriate participant th erapy and/or follow-up.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 107 of 175 10.1.12  Sample Storage and Destruction 
Any blood including PK samples collected according to the SOA ( Section 10.3 ) can be analyzed 
for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study 
participants. This includes testing to ensure an alytical methods produce reliable and valid data 
throughout the course of the study. This can also include, but is not limited to, investigation of 
unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and 
comparability. 
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for analysis 
or storage. Samples will be tracked using a unique  identifier that is assigned to the samples for 
the study. Results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality.  
Samples can be retained for up to 1 year after the final study closure (defined as final CSR). 
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the participant directly or to alter the treatment 
course, the results of pharmacogenetic, or other exploratory studies are not placed in the 
participant’s medical record and are not to be ma de available to the participant, members of the 
family, the personal physician, or ot her third parties, except as specified in the informed consent. 
The participant retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by [CONTACT_458660]. Following the request from the pa rticipant, the investigator is to provide the 
sponsor with the required study and participant number so that any remaining (sample types [eg, blood, tumor]) samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed. 
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol-defined procedures are completed. However, information collected from samples prior to the re quest for destruction, will be retained by [CONTACT_103]. 
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data , discoveries, or derivative materials from the 
sample materials and is responsib le for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the 
participant through the investigator, at the end of  the storage period, or as appropriate (eg, the 
scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample  type no longer justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_458594]). If a commercial product is  developed from this research project, the sponsor owns the 
commercial product. The particip ant has no commercial rights to such product and has no 
commercial rights to the data, information, discoveries, or derivative materials gained or 
produced from the sample. (See Section 10.1.4  for participant confidentiality).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 111 of 175 10.4 Appendix 4: AEs and SAEs: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting 
10.4.1  Definition of AE 
AE Definition 
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant who has 
been administered a pharmaceutical product; it does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (inves tigational) product, whet her or not related to 
the medicinal (inves tigational) product ( International Council for Harmonisation Guidance 
E2A March 1995 ). 
Definition of Unsolicited and Solicited AE 
• An unsolicited AE is an AE that was not solicited using a participant diary and that is communicated by a participant/participant’s parent(s)/caregiver(s )/LAR(s) after signing 
the informed consent. Unsolicited AEs include serious and nonserious AEs. 
• Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (ie, symptoms or illnesses requiring a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency room visit, or visit to/by a healthcare provider). The participants/participant’s parent(s)/caregiver(s )/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_458663](s), as well as any events that, though not medically attended, ar e of participant/participant’s parent(s)/caregiver/LAR)(s) 
concern. Detailed information about reporte d unsolicited AEs will be collected by 
[CONTACT_1746] a nd documented in the participant’s records. 
• Unsolicited AEs that are not medically a ttended nor perceived as a concern by [CONTACT_2416]/participant’s parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) will be collected during an 
interview with the participant/participant’s parent(s)/caregiver/LAR(s) and by [CONTACT_458664]. 
• Solicited AEs are predefined local and systemic events for which the participant is specifically questioned, and which are noted by [CONTACT_139140].

CONFIDENTIAL Page 112 of 175 Events Meeting the AE Definition 
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology,  clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, 12-lead ECGs , vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New condition detected or diagnosed after st udy intervention administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention-intervention interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. 
• Lack of efficacy or failure of expected pharmacological action per se will not be reported 
as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, 
the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.  
• The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be 
reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Lack of efficacy 
or failure of expected pharmacological action also constitutes an AE or SAE. 
 
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
• Any clinically significant abnormal laborat ory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_11009]’s condition. 
• The disease/disorder being st udied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy,  appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.

more of the criteria listed: 
a. Results in death 
b. Is life threatening 
The term life threatening  in the definition of serious refers to an event in which the participant 
was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically 
might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32957] 
• In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12994] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at th e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51956], the AE should be considered serious. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. 
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• The term disability means a substantial disr uption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
f. Is a suspected transmission of any infect ious agent via an authorized medicinal 
product 
g. Other situations: 
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by [CONTACT_458665]. These events should usually be 
considered serious. 
o Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, c onvulsions or development of intervention 
dependency or intervention abuse.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 114 of 175 AE and SAE Recording 
• The monitoring period for AEs begins at the time that informed consent is obtained. 
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], la boratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event. 
• The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information. 
• It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to IRB/IEC in lieu of completion of the required form. 
• There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_458595]/IEC. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_458596]/IEC. 
• The investigator will attempt to establis h a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
• Every reasonable effect will be made to follow up with participants who have AEs. Any 
participant who has an ongoing AE at the la st study visit will be followed up, where 
possible, until resolution, or until the unresolved AE is judged by [CONTACT_093] (or 
designee) to have stabilized. This will be completed at the investigator’s discretion. 
Assessment of Intensity 
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study and assign it to one of the following categories:  
• Mild: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
• Moderate: Minimal, local or noninvasive in tervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living  (ADL). Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], usi ng the telephone, managing money, etc. 
• Severe: Severe or medica lly significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_458597]; disabling, limiting self-care 
ADL. Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing, and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medicati ons, and not bedridden.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 115 of 175 Assessment of Causality 
• The investigator is obligated to assess th e relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator wi ll use clinical judgment to determine the 
relationship. 
• The investigator will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the study 
intervention using a 2-category system according to the following guidelines:  
o Not Related: The AE is definitely or most likely caused by [CONTACT_2299]’s clinical 
state or the study procedure/conditions.  
o Related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause-
effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced. 
• A reasonable possibility  of a relationship conveys that th ere are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• Alternative causes, such as underlying diseas e(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration, will be considered and investigated. 
• The investigator will also consult the IB and/or product information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment. 
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
• There may be situations in which an SAE ha s occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to IRB/IEC. However, it is very important that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to IRB/IEC. 
• The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information 
and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. 
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.

• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other h ealth care professionals. 
• If a participant dies during participation in  the study or during a recognized follow-up 
period, the investigator will provide IRB/IEC with a copy of any postmortem findings 
including histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded  in the originally submitted documents. 
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
 
10.4.4  Reporting of SAEs 
SAE Reporting to IRB/IEC via Paper Data Collection Tool 
• Facsimile or email transmission of the SAE paper data collection tool are the preferred methods to transmit this information to the Pharmacovigilance Team/Vendor. 
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of available equipment, notification by 
[CONTACT_9337] a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by [CONTACT_19515] . 
• Initial notification via telephone  does not replace the need for the investigator to

CONFIDENTIAL Page 137 of 175 10.12.2  Sleep Quality Scale 
 
Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) 85 
Purpose Consisting of 28 items, the SQS evalu-
ates six domains of sleep quality: daytime symp-
toms, restoration after sleep, problems initiating 
and maintaining sleep, difficulty waking, and 
sleep satisfaction. Developers hoped to create a 
scale that could be used as an all-inclusive assess-
ment tool -a general, efficient measure suitable 
for evaluating sleep quality in a variety of patient 
and research populations. 
Population for Testing The scale has been vali-
dated in individuals aged 18-59 years. 
Administration Requiring between 5 and 10 min 
for administration, the scale is a simple self-report, 
pencil-and-paper measure. 
Reliability and Validity An initial psychometric 
evaluation conducted by [CONTACT_458670] [l] 
found an internal consistency of .92, a test-retest 
reliability of .81. The SQS is strongly correlated 
with results obtained on the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_6041] (Chap. 67). Scores achieved by [CONTACT_458671] y higher than those of con-
trols, indicating good construct validity. Obtaining a Copy A list of the scale's 28 items 
can be found in the original article published by 
[CONTACT_458672] s [1].

Email: [EMAIL_8815] 
Scoring Using a four-point, Likert-type scale, 
respondents indicate how frequently they exhibit 
certain sleep behaviors (0 = "few," 1 ="some-
times," 2 = "often," and 3 = "almost always"). 
Scores on items belong to factors 2 and 5 (resto-
ration after sleep and satisfaction with sleep) and 
are reversed before being tallied. Total scores can 
range from 0 to 84, with higher scores demoting 
more acute sleep problems.

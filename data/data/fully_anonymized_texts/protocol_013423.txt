1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
Human epi[INVESTIGATOR_61983]  2 (HER2)  is a highly  valuable  biomarker in breast  cancer,  
and its expression  or gene amplification  directly influences  treatment.  Patients  with HER2  positive  
(HER2+)  breast  cancer  (overexpressed  and/or  gene-amplified) receive  targeted  HER2  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_820087] 1/3rd, while  patient  with HER2  negative  (“normal”) (HER2 -) breast  
cancer  do not receive  them.   However,  10-15% of patients with HER2 - primary  malignancies  on 
repeat  central  testing  (after  an initial  test was positive)  appear  to benefit  from  HER2  targeted  adjuvant  
treatment.   This lack of central  confirmation of positive  HER2  status  has led to the hypothesis  that 
some  patients  without  overexpression/amplification may nonetheless  benefit  from  anti-HER2  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  On the other  hand,  prospective  randomized  trials  that included  patients  with metastases  
known  to only test negative  for HER2  have never  demonstrated benefit  for anti- HER2  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Change  in HER2  status  over time and site is a potential confounder and some  studies  suggest  that a 
minority  of patients  with HER2 - primary malignancies  develop HER2+  metastases,  which  would  
then presumably  respond  to HER2  targeted  therapy.   Indeed, there  is evidence  that up to 10-15% of 
HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  patients develop  HER2+  metastases.  Identifying  such patients  non- 
invasively  would  be an example of targeted  imaging  guiding  the choice  of targeted  therapy.  
We hypothesize  that imaging  with a targeted  HER2  radiotracer  will allow  us to identify  patients 
with HER2 - primary  breast  cancers  who develop  HER2+  metastases,  and who may benefit  from  the 
addition  of HER2  targeted  therapy.  
 
The following  schema will be used to test this central  hypothesis: 
 
Pre-protocol  evaluation  & recruitment: Identify  patients with HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  and 
metastases  demonstrable on CT, MR, and FDG  PET 
 
 
Protocol:  Determine  the proportion of patients  with HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  who develop  
imagable HER2+  metastases  using  a targeted HER2  radiotracer.

3.[ADDRESS_1136707]  cancers,  HER2  is overexpressed  in 20-30% of cases,  and this 
has been  correlated  with resistance to therapy,  shorter  disease - free and overall  survival  in patients 
with this disease 4, 5. The ErbB2/HER2  oncogene  encodes  a transmembrane tyrosine  kinase  receptor  
that belongs  to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_499753]  (EGFR)  family  and plays  an essential  role in 
promoting  cell growth,  migration,  differentiation, proliferation, and survival. The family  is comprised  
of ErbB1  (EGFR/HER1),  ErbB2  (HER2/neu),  ErbB3  (HER3), and ErbB4  (HER4).  Each receptor  has 
an extracellular  domain,  a lipophilic  transmembrane domain,  and an intracellular  tyrosine kinase  
domain.  Activation  of the kinase  occurs  with ligand  binding  and hetero - or homodimerization  of 
these  receptors. Ligand - independent  activation  of HER2  may occur  due to mutations  in HER2  or 
receptor  overexpression 6. Activation plays  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_820089]  7. 
Therefore,  HER2  has become a very important  target  of anticancer  drug development. 
Trastuza mab a nd Pertuzumab 
Trastuzumab  and pertuzumabare humanized  anti-HER2  monoclonal antibodies (Herceptin;  
Genentech,  South  San Francisco,  CA and Perjeta;  Genentech,  South  San Francisco ), that inhibit  the 
growth  of breast  cancer  cells with HER2  over-expression  8. In a landmark  randomized  clinical  trial, 
the addition of trastuzumab  to chemotherapy  improved  response  rates and prolonged survival  for 
patients  with HER2 -overexpressing  metastatic  breast  cancer  9. Large,  multicenter  randomized  
adjuvant  trials  have shown  a 50%  reduction in the risk of recurrence  for women  with HER2+  early  
stage  breast  cancer  treated  with trastuzumab  plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone  10, 11. 
 
Experience  with trastuzumab  and pertuzumab  administration  has shown  that the drug is relatively  
safe. The most  significant  safety signal  observed during  clinical  trials  was cardiac  dysfunction 
(principally  clinically  significant  heart  failure [CHF]),  particularly when  trastuzumab  was given  in 
combination with an anthracycline -containing  regimen.  Much  of the cardiac  dysfunction was 
reversible on discontinuation  of drug.

commonly  consisting of fever  and/or  chills  was observed  in approximately 40%  of patients.  The 
symptoms  were  usually  mild to moderate  in severity  and controlled  with acetaminophen,  
diphenhydramine,  or meperidine.  These  symptoms  were  uncommon  with subsequent infusions.  
However,  in the postapproval  setting,  more  severe  adverse  reactions to trastuzumab have been  
reported.  These  have been  categorized  as hypersensitivity reactions  (including  anaphylaxis), infusion  
reactions,  and pulmonary  events.  Rarely,  these  severe  reactions  culminated  in a fatal outcome.  
There  are no adequate  or well-controlled  studies in pregnant  women,  and animal  reproduction studies  
are not always  predictive of human  response.   Therefore,  these  agents  should be used during  
pregnancy  only if the potential  benefit  to the mother  outweighs  the potential risk to the fetus.  In the 
postmarketing setting,  oligohydramnios  (decreased  amniotic fluid)  has been  reported  in women who 
received  trastuzumab  during  pregnancy,  either  in combination with chemotherapy or as a single  
agent.  Given  the limited  number  of reported  cases,  the high background rate  of occurrence  of 
oligohydramnios,  the lack of clear  temporal relationships  between  drug  use and clinical  findings,  and 
the lack of supportive  findings  in animal  studies,  an association between  trastuzumab  and 
oligohydramnios  has not been  established.  Advise  women of childbearing potential  to use effective  
contraceptive  methods  during  treatment and for seven  months  after last dose of trastuzumab.

Tumor heterogeneity has specific  important  implications  for HER2  negative  (HER2 -) primary  breast  
cancer.  Patients  with HER2  positive  (HER2+)  breast  cancer  (overexpressed  and/or  gene-amplified)  
receive  targeted  HER2  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_820090] 1/3rd, 9, 10 while  patient  with 
HER2  negative  (“normal”)  (HER2 -) breast  cancer  do not receive  them.  However,  10-15% of patients 
with HER2 - primary  malignancies  on repeat  central  testing  (after  an initial  test was positive)  appear  
to benefit  from  HER2  targeted  adjuvant  treatment.  15 This lack of central  confirmation  of positive  
HER2  status  has led to the hypothesis  that some  patients without  overexpression/amplification may

As HER2  is a critical protein  in many  malignancies,  there  has been  
significant   interest   in  targeted   HER2   imaging.     Several   radionuclide  
agents  have been  developed, such as 68Galium-DOTA-F(ab‟)2- 
trastuzumab  17 and 64Cu -DOTA -trastuzumab  18, but their use  has been  
limited  due to the unique  properties  of antibody distribution of radiotracer 
half- lives.  89Zr-trastuzumab and 89Zr-pertuzumab  overcome   these  
limitations  by [CONTACT_820106] a PET radiotracer (89Zr , half- life 78 hours)  that matches  
the pharmacokinetics of the antibody.  The half- life of 89Zr is long enough  
to allow optimal  antibody biodistribution. This results  in PET/CT  images  
with excellent  visualization of HER2+  lesions  in patients  with HER2+  
metastatic  breast  cancer  (Figure  1). 19 Memorial  Sloan-Kettering Cancer  
Center  (MSKCC)  is one of the few institutions  in the world  with 
experience  in 89Zr-trastuzumab and 89Zr-pertuzumab  production  and pre-

MR, or FDG  PET/CT.  At least one biopsy proven  site of metastasis  in the medical record  will be 
required  to provide  proof  of metastatic  breast  cancer  for each patient. The most  recent  body  CT, 
body  MR, and FDG  PET/CT  studies  will be reviewed  to determine  the number  of demonstrable 
metastases.  Demonstrable  metastases  will be defined  as lytic or blastic  osseous  metastases  on CT, 
osseous  metastases  on MR, liver metastases  greater  than 1.5cm  in long axis on CT or MR, lymph  
nodes  greater  than 1.[ADDRESS_1136715] 5 foci of demonstrable  metastases  on recent  clinical  imaging  
modalities will be considered for the protocol. 
HER2  status  will be defined  according  to recently published  ASCO  guidelines,  as described  in "Step  
1" of Section  9.0 "Treatment/Intervention  Plan".  In brief, only patients  that are IHC 0, IHC 1+, or  
IHC 2+ and FISH  < 2.0 on the repeat  testing  or reexamination  will be considered  HER2 - and will 
proceed  to HER2 -targeted  PET/CT.  Patients with repeat  testing  results  of IHC 3+  or IHC 2+ and 
FISH  ≥2.0, will be removed from  the protocol.  
 
Patients  with confirmed  HER2 - breast  cancer  will then undergo  HER2 -targeted  PET/CT.  89Zr- 
trastuzumab  is a novel  radiotracer which  allows  excellent  visualization  of HER2+  lesions.19    89Zr- 
pertuzumab  is a novel  radiotracer  which may allow  for specific  visualization  of HER2+  lesions.  
PET/CT  imaging  with these  novel  radiotracers  will allow  evaluation of all identifiable  malignant  
lesions,  rather  than evaluation of only single  lesions by [CONTACT_9256].   Avid  lesions will be considered  
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_820092]2+  malignancy.   Following amendment 9, we will use 89Zr-pertuzumab  
preferentially,  unless  unavailable  for a successful  imaging  study.  
 
Patients  with at least one 89Zr-trastuzumab or 89Zr-pertuzumab  avid lesion will be biopsied to confirm  
HER2+  pathology.  From  these  [ADDRESS_1136716]  cancer  patients that express  HER2+  malignancy imagable  by [CONTACT_94970]2 -targeted  PET/CT.  
Patients  who are recruited  to the protocol, but then drop out prior  to HER2 -targeted  PET/CT,  will be 
replaced  with newly  recruited  patients.

perform  PET/CT  4-6 days after radiotracer  administration.  
89Zr-trastuzumab  PET/CT  imaging:  89Zr-trastuzumab PET studies  will be performed  as hybrid  
PET/CT  examinations  for attenuation correction, lesion localization,  and availability  of additional CT 
data. 4 to 6 days following radiotracer administration, the patient will be positioned on a GE PET/CT 
scanner,  dedicated  for research  scans  at MSKCC.  The CT component  will be obtained  utilizing  a low 
mA (80 mA) to minimize  radiation exposure.  3D imaging  will be obtained  from  the mid skull  to 
proximal  thighs  (approximately  6-7 bed positions).  89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  PET/CT  
images  will be reconstructed  using  iterative  reconstruction,  and displayed  in multiplanar  
reconstruction.  
89Zr-trastuzumab  and 89Zr-pertuzumab  P ET/C  T interp  reta tio n: HER2 -targeted  PET/CT  scans  will be

pool,  liver,  spleen,  and kidneys.  Radiotracer uptake  in areas  which are not physiologic  will be graded  
both qualitatively  and semiquantitatively.  For qualitative  scoring,  we will use a score  of five where  1 
= definitely  normal,  2 = probably  normal,  3 = equivocal, 4 = probably  abnormal,  and 5 = definitely  
abnormal.  Semiquantitative  analysis  of tracer  uptake  will be performed for all grade [ADDRESS_1136718]  (ROIs)  will be placed  over grade  4 and 5 lesions,  the liver,  and the mediastinal 
blood  pool,  and tracer  uptake  will be quantified  using  standardized  uptake  value  (SUV),  calculated  
as: SUV  = decay  corrected  mean  ROI activity  (μCi/ml) / (injected  dose (μCi)/ body  weight  (g)). 
Both  SUVmax  and SUVpeak  will be recorded  for lesions,  and SUVmax  and SUVaverage  will be 
recorded  for background  measurements.  Only  those  foci qualitatively  scored  conspi[INVESTIGATOR_820093]  (scores  of 4 or 5) will be considered  as   “positive”.

89Zr-trastuzumab  is composed  of the native  HER2  targeting  drug  trastuzumab   conjugated  with 
desferrioxamine  (DFO)  and  labelled  with the positron  emitting  radionuclide  zirconium  89 (89Zr). 
89Zr-pertuzumab  is composed of the native  HER2  targeting  drug trastuzumab  conjugated  with 
desferrioxamine  (DFO)  and  labelled  with the positron  emitting  radionuclide  zirconium  89 (89Zr). 
Trastuzumab  and pertuzumab  are FDA  approved  monoclonal antibodies  that disrupt  HER2  receptor  
signaling.  89Zr is a metallo -radionuclide  with a half- life of 78 hours,  long enough  to allow  favorable  
biodistribution of radiolabeled antibodies. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer  Center  is one of the few 
institutions  in the world  with experience in 89Zr-trastuzumab  a nd 89Zr-pertuzumab  production  and

Dose  of 89Zr-trastuzumab and 89Zr-pertuzumab: Patients  will receive  between  37 and 203 Mbq  (1.0 
and 5.5 mCi) of 89Zr-trastuzumab given IV over 5-10 min, depending on radiotracer production 
capacity.  The initial  injected  activity  is expected  to be 185Mbq  (5 mCi) +/- 10% with full radiotracer  
production capacity.  The activity  may be adjusted  downward  in later patients  if imaging  quality  can 
be maintained  at a lower  level  of activtiy.  In order  to optimize  tumor  targeting  radiolabeled 89Zr- 
trastuzumab  will be brought  up to a final mass  dose of 50mg  by [CONTACT_820109]-radiolabeled trastuzumab  
(For example: 185MBq  in 3mg 89Zr -trastuzumab  added  to 47 mg of non-radiolabeled trastuzumab).

Eligible  patients will be approached  to enroll  in the protocol  and provide written  informed  consent.  
 
 
Potential research  subjects  will be identified  by a member of the patient ‟s treatment  team,  the 
protocol  investigator,  or research  team  at Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  (MSKCC). If the 
investigator  is amember of the treatment  team,  s/he will screen  their patient‟s medical records  for

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
The aim of this study  is to determine  the proportion of patients  with HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  
who develop  imagable HER2+  metastases  using  a targeted  HER2  radiotracer.  Once a patient is 
confirmed  eligible  for protocol  participation, the following  will occur:  
 
 
Step  1. HER2 -targeted   PET/CT  to  identify   patients  with 89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  
positive  foc i susp ic io us for HER2+  metastases.  
 
Patients  with confirmed HER2 - malignancy  from  archived  pathology  samples  will undergo  HER2 - 
targeted  PET/CT  to determine  if the patient  demonstrates 89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  
positive  lesions  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_820092]2+  metastases.  Please  see section  4.2 for a discussion of HER2 - 
targeted  PET/CT  imaging  and interpretation.  
 
 
Step 2. Biopsy  to  confirm  HER2+   status  of at least one 89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  
metastasis  
 
89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  positive  foci will be suspected  of being  HER2+  metastases.  At 
least one of these  foci will be biopsied  to confirm  a HER2+  breast  cancer  metastasis  at the suspected  
site. 
Selectio  n o f b iopsy  targe  t a nd performa  nce o f b iopsy: Biopsies  will be performed  by a fellowship  
trained  oncologic interventional  radiologist,  experienced in ultrasound,  CT, and PET/CT  guided  
biopsies.  In order  to minimize  risk to the patient,  site selection  will be performed  with consultation 
between  the study  PI [INVESTIGATOR_820095].  PET and CT images  will be reviewed  to 
determine  the most  accessible  and least invasive  site of suspected  89Zr-trastuzumab or 89Zr-pertuzumab  
avid metastatic  disease.  If the avid lesion is believed  to be amenable to ultrasound  guided  biopsy  
(lymph nodes,  soft tissue  lesions),  then ultrasound  guided  biopsy will be performed. Next,  CT guided  
biopsy will be considered for lesions  determined  to be inaccessible to ultrasound,  but visible  on CT 
(lytic  and sclerotic osseous  lesions,  liver lesions,  lung nodules).  In cases  where  the focus  cannot  be 
localized  by [CONTACT_820113], then a PET/CT  guided  biopsy  will be utilized.  MSKCC  has 
substantial  experience  with PET/CT  guided  biopsy of radiotracer avid foci which  are occult  on CT. 
One-to-three  18-[ADDRESS_1136723] will 
determine  if PT/INR  or other  laboratory  tests shall  be performed  prior to biopsy.  In most  cases  this 
will result in PT/INR  measurement.  
 
If a biopsy  is not performed  because  no avid foci are deemed  amenable  to biopsy, then the patient ‟s 
participation in the protocol  will end at this point.  They  will be counted  as 1 of the 50 patients  to 
undergo  the HER2 -targeted   PET/CT  as part of this study.

Patho  lo gic a na lysis o f b iop sy sa mp les: Pathologic analysis  will be performed  by a board -certified  
breast  pathology  specialist  with more  than [ADDRESS_1136724]  cancer  metastases  will then undergo  evaluation for HER2  
expression  by [CONTACT_9064],  as described above.  The immunohistochemical  results  will be 
as follows:  0, 1+ = negative  result;  2+ = equivocal  result;  and 3+ = positive  result.  Tissues  with 2+ 
staining  (equivocal)  will go on to analysis  with fluorescent  in situ hybridization (FISH)  for HER2  
amplification as per ASCO  guidelines.  26 FISH  is performed from  paraffin  embedded tissue  using  
FDA -approved  ERBB2  (HER2/NEU)  PathVysion  assay  probes  and procedure.  Green  fluorescence  
represents  CEP17,  while  red fluorescence  represents  Her2.  A HER2/CEP17  ratio of > 2.0 HER2  will 
be considered  positive.  Only  tissues  with 3+ immunohistochemical staining  or tissues  with 2+ 
immunohistochemical  staining  AND  positive  HER2  FISH  will be considered “HER2  positive”. 
These  criteria  for HER2+  breast  cancer  are equivalent  to the recently  published  ASCO  guidelines25. 
If the pathologic analysis of a 89Zr-trastuzumab  avid focus  yields  inconclusive  tissue  or results,  then 
the possibility  of an additional biopsy will be discussed with the patient and the interventional  
radiologist.  
 
Only  patients  with HER2+  metastases  on pathology  will be considered  to have proven  HER2+  
disease  . 
 
 
10.0   EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
89Zr-trastuzumab  and 89Zr-pertuzumab  PET/CT  scans  will be interpreted  by [CONTACT_820114],  both experienced  in the use novel  research  PET radiotracers.  Physiologic 89Zr- 
trastuzumab  uptake  will be expected  in the blood  pool,  liver,  spleen,  and kidneys.  Radiotracer  uptake  
in areas  which  are not physiologic will be graded  both qualitatively  and semiquantitatively.  For 
qualitative  scoring,  we will use a score  of five where  1 = definitely  normal,  2 = probably  normal,  3 = 
equivocal,  4 = probably  abnormal,  and 5 = definitely  abnormal.  Semiquantitative  analysis  of tracer  
uptake  will be performed  for all grade  [ADDRESS_1136725]  (ROIs)  will be placed  in 
these  areas  and tracer  uptake will be quantified  using  standardized  uptake  value  (SUV),  calculated as: 
SUV  = decay  corrected  mean  ROI activity  (μCi/ml) / (injected  dose (μCi)/ body  weight  (g)). Both  
SUVmax  and SUVpeak  will be recorded  for lesions,  and SUVmax and SUVaverage  will be recorded  
for background  measurements.  Only  those  foci qualitatively  scored  conspi[INVESTIGATOR_820096]  (scores  of 4 or 5) will be considered as  “positive”.  
 
11.0   TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
89Zr-trastuzumab  and 89Zr-pertuzumab:  These  diagnostic agents  are expected  to have  a very low 
incidence  of adverse  events.  Nevertheless,  patients  will be monitored  closely  for evidence  of adverse  
event,  including  vital signs  and followup  patient  reporting.    If a severe  adverse  effect  (Common

Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  grade  3 or 4) attributable  to 89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr- 
pertuzumab  occurs  in any patient,  then further  use will be suspended  and the protocol  reviewed with 
the MSKCC  Data Safety Monitoring  Committee.  
Less Like ly: Infusion  or allergic reactions,  which may include  fevers

Rad ia tio n risk: We will image with 37 and 203 Mbq (1.0 and 5.5 mCi) of 89Zr-trastuzumab or 89Zr- 
pertuzumab.  The effective  dose from  185MBq  of 89Zr-trastuzumab  is estimated  to be 7.4 cGy (see 
Appendix  1).[ADDRESS_1136726] scan,  performed  as part of the hybrid  89Zr-trastuzumab  
PET/CT,   has  an effective   dose  of 0.9  rem.    The  effective   dose  from   the  experimental  89Zr- 
trastuzumab  PET/CT  examination is 8.3 rem, which  is comparable  to the dose from  other  
radiolabeled  antibodies received  by [CONTACT_820115]. 
 
Pregna  nc y risk: Even  low diagnostic  levels  of radiation,  such as those  that will be received  in this 
protocol  from  the investigational PET/CT  studies,  are associated  with a risk of inducing  childhood  
cancer.  HER2  targeted  systemic  therapy  could  have additional  pregnancy  risks. A negative  
pregnancy  test will be required  before patient  accrual  to this protocol. Patients on this protocol  will 
be advised  not to become  pregnant  during the time period  of the protocol.  
 
Biopsy  risk s: Minimally  invasive  biopsy  procedures  are selected  to minimize  the risk to patients;  
however,  risks cannot  be eliminated.  Risks  from  biopsies include  pain,  bleeding,  infection,  and need 
for additional procedures.  Risks  may vary based  on site of biopsy.  Most  biopsies  will be of lymph  
nodes or bones.  
 
 
12.0   CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
There  are no criteria  for therapeutic  response.  This protocol  will identify  previously unknown  
HER2+  metastases  in presumed HER2 - breast  cancer  patients.  
 
 
13.0     CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
• Patients  may withdraw  from  the protocol  voluntarily  at any time.  
• Development  of unacceptable  toxicity.  
• The patient  is found  to be ineligible  for the protocol  as designated  in the section on Criteria 
for Patient/Subject  Eligibility.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -156 A(13)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1136727] one lesion per patient  will be biopsied to 
confirm  HER2+  pathology.  We expect  5-[ADDRESS_1136728] one such lesion,  based  on a 
previous  study  that estimated  this proportion  as 12 % in biopsy samples,  which is limited  compared 
with our whole  body  imaging.  We will report  the proportion  of patients with at least one 
pathologically verified  HER2+  lesion  along with its 95% exact  binomial  confidence  interval  with an 
anticipated  half- width of 14%.  We note that this is a lower  bound  to the proportion of patients  with 
HER2+  metastases  from  a HER2 - primary.  To prevent  unnecessary imaging,  we will perform  an 
interim  analysis  after 23 patients are imaged.  If none of the 23 patients has a pathologically verified  
HER2  positive  metastasis,  then we will stop the trial. The probabilities  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_820097] 5% 
and 63% if the proportions of patients with pathology verified  HER2  positive  lesions are 12% and 
2%. To precent  unnecessary  biopsies  we will perform separate  interim  analyses  using  the data from  
patients  who had a biopsy following  positive    imaging.  This is especially a concern  if there  are more  
patients  with uptake than expected.  Since  the number  of biopsied patients is not known  at this stage  
we implement  this decision  rule in a rolling  fashion:  if [ADDRESS_1136729] 
no pathologically confirmed  HER2+  disease,  then HER2 -targeted  imaging  will be deemed  
insufficiently specific and the study  will stop to prevent  unnecessary  biopsies.  If the study  continues  
beyond  the first [ADDRESS_1136730] at 15 biopsied patients  
(if reached).  If [ADDRESS_1136731] no pathologically confirmed  HER2+  disease, then 
we will stop the study. Based  on this rule the probability  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_820098] 90% if the true 
proportion  of HER2+  disease  in biopsied patients  is 50%.  The probability  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_820099] 
20% if the true proportion of HER2+  disease in biopsied patients  is 75%.

A research  study  assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to this study.  The responsibilities of the 
RSA  include  project  compliance,  data collection, and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory 
monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordination of activities of the 
protocol  study  team.  The data collected  from  this study  will be entered  into a secure  
database.  Source  documentation will be available  to support  the computerized patient  record.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness of 
registration  data. Routine data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations and follow -up will be 
monitored  periodically throughout  the study  period and potential problems will be brought  to 
the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were approved by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the new 
policies  set forth  by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  
for Data  and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials” which can be found  at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html. The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_11096].  The MSKCC  Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: 
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm. 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_211148], safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic response,  and staff education 
on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two 
institutional  committees  that are responsible for monitoring the activities  of our clinical  trials  
programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and 
II clinical  trials,  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  
trials, report  to the Center ‟s Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level  of risk and degree  of monitoring required. Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in- house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) Will be addressed  and 
the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation. 
The protocol  will be conducted  in accordance  with the protocol  submitted  to and approved  by 
[CONTACT_820117] d‟s ([LOCATION_003]MRMC)  Office of 
Research  Protections (ORP),  Human  Research  Protection Office (HRPO).  
Accurate and complete study  records  will be maintained  and made  available  to representatives  
of the U.S. Army  Medical  Research  and Materiel  Command as a part of their responsibility to 
protect  human  subjects  in research.  Research  records  will be stored  in a confidential  manner  
so as to protect  the confidentiality  of subject  information.

• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425] 
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect

surgical intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition 
Note : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease treatment  is not considered an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is req uired  as soo n as the p artic ipa nt signs  co nse nt. SAE  reporting  is required  
for 30-days after the participant‟s last investigational treatment  or intervention.  Any events  
that occur  after the 30-dau period and that are at least possibly related  to protocol  treatment  
must  be reported.  
If a n SAE  req uire s sub missio  n to the IRB o ffic e per SOP RR-408 „Reporting  of Serioues  
Adverse  Events ‟, the SAE  report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE  report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE  Office as follows:  
For IND/IDE  trials: Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE  should be sent to  
saegrade5@  msk cc.org . All other  reports  should  be sent to sae msk ind@  mskcc.org . 
For all other  trials: Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE  should be  sent to  
saegrade5@  msk cc.org . All other  reports  should  be sent to sae@  mskcc.org . 
 
 
The report  should containg  the following  information:  Fields populated from  CRDB:  
 
• Subject ‟s initials  
• Medical record  number  
• Disease/histology (if applicable)  
• Protocol  number  and title 
Data needing  to be entered:  
• The date the adverse  event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event  to the treatment (drug, device,  or intervention) 
• If the AE was expected  
• The severity  of the AE 
• The intervention 
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o An explanation of how the AE was handled  
o A description  of the subject ‟s condition 
o Indication if the subject  remains  on the study  
• If an amendment will need to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form 
• If the SAE  is an Unanticipated  Problem

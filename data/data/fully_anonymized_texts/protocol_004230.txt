The Specific Aims of this study are to:  
 
1. Identify changes in brain function and structure that correlate with response to 
erenumab.   
 
2. Develop models using imaging data to predict which patients will respond to erenumab . 
Pre-treatment and early post-treatment imaging data will be used separately for predictive 
modeling.  
  
The study will include [ADDRESS_140425] clinical outcomes at eight weeks. Physiologic and imaging data will be compared to 
already collected data from healthy controls so as to interpret changes that are seen following 
treatment with erenumab. 
 
The primary hypothesis is that improvements in migraine patterns associated with erenumab 
treatment will be associated with “normalization” of brain function. Secondarily, it is hypothesized that 
improvements in migraine patterns associated with erenumab treatment will be associated with 
“normalization” of brain structure, pain thresholds, and cognitive performance. Finally, it is 
hypothesized that exploratory analyses will demonstrate that there are early changes in brain function 
following the first treatment with erenumab and that these early changes will be predictive of longer-
term clinical responsiveness to erenumab.

Background  
  
Migraine is a highly prevalent disorder that affects 38 million people in the US and is associated with 
moderate to severe pain, hypersensitivities to sensory stimuli, nausea, vomiting, and reduced quality 
of life. (1-3) Annual costs from migraine are estimated at $20 billion in the [LOCATION_002] and €27 
billion in Europe. (4, 5) Migraine remains poorly treated and there are currently few options for the 
preventive treatment of migraine. The release of erenumab to the market represents a substantial 
improvement in the landscape of migraine preventive treatment. 
 
Phase [ADDRESS_140431] demonstrated that 
erenumab  is safe and effective for the prevention of epi[INVESTIGATOR_33176]. (6-8) Erenumab 
received US Food and Drug Administration approval for the prevention of migraine in May 2018. 
Structural and functional neuroimaging could provide important insights into central mechanisms of 
treatment response and imaging biomarkers that track treatment response or are indicators for early 
treatment response. A few studies have demonstrated normalization of functional activation patterns, 
reorganization of functional connectivity, and normalization of brain metabolism following migraine 
treatment with external trigeminal neurostimulation, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], and precision ophthalmic tints. (9-
12) However, the effects of erenumab on brain function and structure, including the processing of 
painful stimuli, have been inadequately investigated. Furthermore, it is possible that measures of 
brain function and structure could serve as predictors for clinical response to erenumab, either prior 
to treatment or early after the first treatment. It is of clinical interest to interrogate whether 
neuroimaging is a useful technique for establishing a brain biomarker for predicting treatment 
response and measuring treatment responses earlier than is possible using clinical measures alone.  
 
This study will investigate longitudinal changes in brain structure and function in high frequency 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_124964]-responders. In addition, pre-treatment and early post-
treatment brain imaging data will be used to build models that predict which individual migraine 
patients will respond to erenumab treatment. 
 
The Specific Aims of this study are to:  
 
1. Identify changes in brain function and structure that correlate with response to 
erenumab.  This objective of this aim is to investigate effects of treatment with erenumab on 
brain function and structure in patients who respond to treatment with erenumab and in 
patients who do not respond to treatment with erenumab.  
 
2. Develop models to predict which patients will respond to erenumab . The goal of this aim is 
to identify structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging predictors of response to 
erenumab in patients with migraine. Specifically, this aim seeks to identify those migraine 
patients who are going to have a positive response to erenumab treatment versus those who will 
not respond to treatment. Pre-treatment and early post-treatment imaging data will be used 
separately, and in combination, for predictive modeling.  
 
 [ADDRESS_140432] completed studies 
comparing noxious heat-induced brain activation patterns in people with migraine vs. healthy 
controls. (13) These studies showed that migraineurs have greater pain-induced activation in several 
brain regions, many of which participate in cognitive aspects of pain processing. For several of these 
regions, the extent of greater activation correlated with the frequency of headaches, serving as strong 
evidence for a direct relationship between having migraine and greater activation of these pain-
processing brain regions and at least suggesting that reductions in headache frequency would 
correlate with reductions in pain-induced activation. Our resting-state functional connectivity studies 
have investigated functional connectivity of affective-emotional pain processing regions and of 
descending pain modulatory brainstem regions. (14, 15) These studies demonstrated that 
migraineurs have atypi[INVESTIGATOR_124965]. Our structural MRI studies have shown migraineurs to have atypi[INVESTIGATOR_124966], aberrant correlations between brain cortical 
thickness and cutaneous pain thresholds, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_124967], and abnormal white 
matter tract integrity. (16-18) Furthermore, our work has shown migraineurs with interictal 
photosensitivity to have thicker cerebral cortex in parieto-occipi[INVESTIGATOR_124968]-parietal regions. (19) 
Finally, our machine-learning multivariate pattern analyses have yielded migraine classifiers that use 
brain structural data to differentiate the brain of an individual chronic migraineur from that of a 
healthy control (see Figure 1) or epi[INVESTIGATOR_124969] (see Figure 2) with high accuracy (American 
Headache Society Wolff Award winning paper). (20) Our classifiers based on resting state functional 
connectivity data differentiate the brain of an individual migraineur from a healthy control with high 
accuracy (American Academy of Neurology Harold Wolff – John Graham Award winning research, see 
Figure 3). (20, 21) In addition, we developed a decision support system using multi-modality imaging 
data to interrogate the utility of combining structural and functional imaging data for migraine 
patient discrimination and the accuracy of such discrimination. (see Figure 4) (22) Results showed 
better classification accuracy when combining structural and functional data than using either data 
type alone.

healthy control. (20) Structural measures (i.e. cortical thickness, volume, surface area) of the colored 
brain regions allow for classification of the individual brain MRI as belonging to a person with 
chronic migraine vs. a healthy control with 86.3% average accuracy.  Similar model-building 
techniques can be used to construct classifiers that predict response to erenumab.

chronic migraine vs. epi[INVESTIGATOR_25408] 84.2% average accuracy. Similar model-building

disease durations were more accurately classified than migraine patients with shorter disease 
durations. Similar model building techniques could be used to track and predict response to 
erenumab treatment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 10Figure 4: Key brain areas (based on brain structural imaging) and functional connections 
(based on resting-state imaging) that contribute to distinguishing migraine patients from 
healthy controls. (22) The combined model that included structural and functional data 
provided greater accuracy (83%) compared to the model based on structural data alone 
(80%) and the model built on functional connectivity data alone (75%). The combination of 
structural and functional brain imaging data may increase the classification accuracy for 
predicting/determining treatment response to erenumab.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 11Specific Aims  
 
1. Identify changes in brain function and structure that correlate with response to 
erenumab.  The objective of this aim is to investigate effects of treatment with erenumab on 
brain function and structure in patients who respond to treatment with erenumab and in 
patients who do not respond to treatment with erenumab. Specifically, this aim will assess 
changes in brain structure (cortical thickness, volume, area, white matter integrity), brain 
perfusion, resting-state functional connectivity, and pain-induced brain activation patterns in 
treatment responders and in treatment non-responders. This aim will identify structural and 
functional brain biomarkers for treatment response with erenumab. 
 
2. Develop models to predict which patients will respond to erenumab . The goal of this aim is 
to identify structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging predictors of response to 
erenumab in patients with migraine. Specifically, this aim seeks to identify those migraine 
patients who are going to have a positive response to erenumab treatment versus those who will 
not respond to treatment. Pre-treatment and early post-treatment imaging data will be used 
separately, and also in combination, for predictive modeling.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12Methods  
 
Study Design: This is a prospective, open-label, longitudinal, pre- and post-treatment magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) study of patients treated with erenumab. A summary of the study flow is 
presented in Table 1.  
 
Table 1- Study Flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
Participants: Up to [ADDRESS_140434] 18 years of age but younger than 66 years of age with high frequency epi[INVESTIGATOR_124970]/or without aura will be enrolled 
into the run-in phase of this study at Mayo Clinic Arizona.  Enrollment will stop once 50 subjects 
provide headache diary during the run-in phase that meets eligibility criteria (i.e. documented 6-25 
migraine days per 28 days).  Previously collected data of healthy control subjects (n=50) will be used 
for data comparison.  Exclusion and inclusion criteria will be modeled after those used in the phase 2 
and 3 trials of erenumab for the prevention of migraine. (6, 8) In addition, patients who have 
contraindications to MRI (e.g. metal implants, aneurysm clips, severe claustrophobia) will be excluded 
from study participation. Potential participants will be excluded if they have active chronic pain 
conditions other than migraine (e.g. chronic pelvic pain) or acute pain conditions (e.g. recent surgery). 
Potential participants who have sensory disorders that might affect the perception of cutaneous 
thermal stimuli will also be excluded (e.g. peripheral neuropathy).

Run in Phase (4 weeks) At this initial visit , whether in person or via telephone, participants will be screened for 
inclusion/exclusion and data on their demographics, headache characteristics, current and past 
treatments, and medical history will be collected. Those meeting criteria for further participation will 
be trained on how to use the headache diary. Patients will be instructed to keep a prospective 
headache diary for the next 4 weeks. We assume that up to 25% of individuals participating in the 
run-in phase will not meet the migraine day frequency inclusion criteria and/or diary compliance 
minimum and thus will not continue in this study. 
 
Baseline (first treatment) Visit Patients will return for a baseline visit after 4 weeks (i.e. 28 days +/- 3 days since start of run-in 
phase) of prospective headache diary collection. Diary compliance and eligibility for study inclusion 
will be assessed. Patients who still meet eligibility criteria will have measurement of vital signs and 
urine pregnancy testing will be conducted for women of childbearing potential. Levels of depression 
and anxiety will be measured using the Beck Depression Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, 
respectively. Functional disability will be assessed with the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) 
and the Migraine Functional Impairment Questionnaire (MFIQ). Symptoms of cutaneous allodynia will 
be assessed using the Allodynia Symptom Checklist 12. Symptoms of cognitive dysfunction associated 
with migraine will be assessed using the Mig-Scog Questionnaire. (24, 25) Patients will undergo 
 17quantitative sensory testing (QST) for determination of heat pain thresholds and the temperature that 
results in moderate intensity heat pain. (13, 26, 27) To assess cognitive function, patients will 
complete two attention tasks; a computer version of the n-back task and Trails A and B.

Pain Threshold Testing 
QST for determining cutaneous heat pain thresholds has been used extensively in our lab. (13, 26, 27) 
A Medoc Pathway platform with a 30 mm x 30 mm thermode is used for testing. Heat pain thresholds 
are determined for the right and the left forearm and for the right and left forehead. The thermode is 
applied to the skin and fastened with a Velcro strap. The method-of-limits is used: thermode starts at 
[ADDRESS_140439] severe pain. Initially, subjects are stimulated for 7.5 seconds with a temperature equal to their 
heat pain threshold plus 1 degree Celsius. Individuals then rate the pain intensity. If pain intensity is 
rated below 4, the temperature is increased in 0.5 degree Celsius increments until rated between 4 
and 7. Conversely, if the pain intensity is rated greater than 7, the stimulation temperature is 
decreased in 0.5 degree Celsius increments. 
 
Imaging Protocol Brain MRI will be performed on a Siemens 3T scanner at the Mayo Clinic. The MRI paradigm will 
include: 1) high-resolution T1-weighted imaging allowing for advanced structural analyses such as 
determining regional volumes, cortical thickness and surface area; 2) T2-weighted imaging to rule out 
pre-existing structural brain abnormalities (e.g. incidental findings); 3) Diffusion Tensor Imaging 
(DTI) used for assessing white matter integrity; 4) ten minutes of resting-state Blood Oxygen Level 
Dependent (BOLD) signal collection for resting state functional connectivity analyses; 5) event-
related paradigm during which patients are exposed to cutaneous thermal stimuli causing moderately 
intense heat pain so that brain responses to pain can be measured; and 6) Arterial Spin Labeling 
(ASL) to assess cerebral blood flow.  
 
N-Back Task 
For purposes of test standardization and data interpretation, all subjects will complete the computer-
based version of the n-back task on one of two MacBook laptops. The software for the n-back task will 
be downloaded on the laptops and subject task performance will be automatically calculated and 
summarized- thus eliminating testing bias.  
 
Trails A and B 
Subjects will complete the standardized worksheets of Trails A and B. On Trails A, subjects are asked 
to connect consecutive numbers from 1-25. On Trails B, subjects are asked to alternate between 
 20connecting numbers and letters. (i.e., 1-A-2-B-3-C, and so forth)  Both tests are measuring attention 
and processing speed. For both tests, number of errors are recorded as well as the number of seconds 
required to complete each task.  
 
Treatment with Erenumab Patients receive treatment with [ADDRESS_140440] by a qualified 
research team member and then will do so under research team observation or receive the injections 
administered by a qualified research team member. Injections will be administered in the abdomen 
(except for a two inch area right around the navel), thigh, or outer area of upper arm (if someone else 
is injecting the patient) according to patient preference and will consist of two consecutive [ADDRESS_140441] injection. 
 
Erenumab will be stored refrigerated at 2 °C to 8° C (36 °F to 46 °F) until time of use. Once removed 
from the refrigerator, it will be kept at room temperature and used within [ADDRESS_140442] 
sunlight.  
 
Daily Headache Diary A daily headache diary will be completed for the next 12 weeks to allow for assessment of changes in 
headache and migraine frequency. Headache diary data will be analyzed to classify patients as 
“responders” (50% or greater reduction in migraine day frequency between weeks 5-[ADDRESS_140443] 
erenumab treatment compared to frequency during the run-in phase) or “non-responders” (less than 
50% reduction in migraine day frequency during weeks 5-[ADDRESS_140444] erenumab treatment compared 
to the frequency during the run-in phase). Since patient outcome will be measured at 8 weeks 
(opposed to 12 weeks like is done in the majority of clinical trials), depending upon patient outcomes 
other definitions of “response” and “non-response” could be used. Furthermore, correlations between 
changes in migraine frequency and imaging outcomes could also be assessed.  
 
A migraine day will be defined as follows: any calendar day during which a person experiences a 
qualified migraine headache (onset, continuation, or recurrence of the migraine headache). A 
qualified migraine headache is defined as a migraine with or without aura, lasting for at least [ADDRESS_140445] one of the following criteria (a and/or b): 
 
a) At least 2 of the following pain features: unilateral, throbbing, moderate to severe, exacerbated 
with exercise/physical activity 
b) At least 1 of the following associated symptoms: nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia and 
phonophobia 
 
If the participant takes a migraine-specific medication (i.e. triptan or ergotamine) during aura or to 
treat headache on a calendar day, then it will be counted as a migraine day regardless of the duration 
and pain features/associated symptoms. 
 
Missing values may exist in headache dairy data due to various reasons such as subjects’ missed 
recording, early withdrawal, or inadequate entries prohibiting evaluation of the end point (responder 
vs. non-responder). To impute the missing data and allow for evaluation of migraine frequency, 
 21classic imputation methods commonly used in clinical trials will be adopted.(6) Specifically, for 
months with 20-[ADDRESS_140446]-treatment periods. That is, monthly migraine frequency can be calculated as the 
ratio of number of observed migraine days to number of observed days multiplied by 28. For months 
with less than 10 days of dairy data, monthly migraine frequency will be estimated by [CONTACT_124994]’s previous 28-day period score, multiplied by [CONTACT_124995]. For post-treatment periods with 10–
19 days of diary data, scores will be estimated using a mean of both methods. 
 
Follow up visits One through Four (see table 1): Four follow-up visits will be scheduled: at weeks 2, 4, [ADDRESS_140447]-initial treatment with erenumab (week 2 = 14 days +/- [ADDRESS_140448] visit; week 4 = 
28 days +[ADDRESS_140449] visit; week 8 = 56 days +/- [ADDRESS_140450] visit; week 12 = 84 days +/- [ADDRESS_140451] visit). The early follow-up at [ADDRESS_140452], brain imaging and 
cognitive testing so that data are available for investigating early markers/predictors of treatment 
response. A second treatment with erenumab will occur during the 4-week visit. Imaging, QST and 
neurocognitive testing will be repeated during the 8-week visit, allowing for determination of 
biomarkers for treatment response that might not have been found at the early time-point of 2 weeks 
and that can be correlated with clinical measures of treatment response (i.e. changes in migraine day 
frequency). The 12-week visit will allow for further assessment of safety and efficacy.  
 
Acute Migraine Therapy: Patients will be allowed to use acute headache treatments including migraine-specific medication (e.g. triptans, ergotamine derivatives) and NSAIDs during the study. 
 
Other Migraine Preventive Therapy: Patients will be allowed to use two or fewer migraine preventive 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_124975] 2 months before the 
start of the run-in phase. Changes to the dose of such treatments will not be allowed during this study 
unless necessary due to safety issues or lack of tolerability.   
 
Imaging Data Plans All imaging will be collected at Mayo Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52123] a 3-Tesla Siemens (Siemens MAGNETOM Skyra, 
Erlangen, [LOCATION_013]) scanner using a 20-channel head/neck coil. Structural analyses will utilize 
FreeSurfer  5.3 
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu ) a 
commonly used brain segmentation software 
for measurements of 68 regional volumes, 68 
measurements of cortical thickness, and 68 
measurements of cortical surface area. The 
methodology for FreeSurfer is well-
documented and established and includes 
skull strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], automated Talairach 
transformation, segmentation of gray and 
white matter regions, intensity 
normalization, brain boundary tessellation, 
topology correction and deformation of 
surface structures.(28-32) Resting state (rs)-
fMRI data will be analyzed using SPM 8 

 22(Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, Institute of Neurology, London, [LOCATION_006]) and the toolbox 
DPARSF interfaced with MATLAB version 11.0 (MathWorks, Natick, Ma, [LOCATION_003]).(33) Rs-fMRI data will 
be pre-processed using standard procedures including the following steps: slice-time correction, 
motion correction, re-alignment, skull and non-brain tissue removal, spatial smoothing, and 
alignment to an average Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-305) template.(34, 35) Further post-
processing steps will include band-pass filtering, as well as removal of variance related to head 
motion, white matter signal and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_79723]. Functional measurements will be imported 
into SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) for further calculations. A region-of-interest approach will be 
utilized for functional connectivity analyses. The functional connectivity of 33 regions which 
commonly participate in pain-processing will be analyzed. Event-related BOLD data will be analyzed 
using a whole-brain analysis, comparing BOLD amplitude during painful stimuli vs. no stimuli. All 
preprocessing and general linear model (GLM) estimation of brain activation patterns for the event-
related portion of the fMRI will also be performed using SPM8, interfaced with Matlab. Functional 
images will be realigned to the mean volume in the series, motion-corrected, realigned to each 
individual’s structural images, normalized to standard stereotaxic space (Montreal Neurological 
Institute template) and smoothed using a [ADDRESS_140453] maps 
representing brain activations associated with painful stimuli preceded by [CONTACT_124996]. auditory 
cue with no painful stimuli. The BOLD signal will be modeled for each of eight successive MR frames 
(20 seconds) following stimulus presentation, with no assumption made about the shape of the 
hemodynamic response function. These contrast maps are entered into a mixed effects analysis. A 
main effects analysis will identify brain regions activated in subjects and a two-sample analysis will 
identify regions differentially activated when comparing subject cohorts. Cluster threshold correction 
and multiple comparisons correction will be utilized. 18 major fiber tracts will be reconstructed from 
DTI data using an automated technique based upon global probabilistic tractography (TRACULA).(36) 
This software toolbox is available online ( http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/ ) and uses anatomical priors (T1-weighted data) as input.  The robustness of the TRACULA software algorithm has been 
validated in prior papers.(36, 37) For each of the [ADDRESS_140454] volume, path length, axial 
diffusivity, radial diffusivity, mean diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy will be calculated. Arterial 
Spin Labeling data will be analyzed using SPM 8 and the toolbox ASLtbx.(38) SPM [ADDRESS_140455] SPM preprocessing steps including orientation resetting, image 
reorienting, motion correction, and co-registration (of each subjects’ T1-weighted image with the ASL 
images) and data smoothing. Subsequent data post-processing steps will be conducted using the 
ASLtbx toolbox. Statistical analyses will be conducted using a GLM design.  
 
Quality control of structural and functional imaging data: Radiology technicians at Mayo Clinic are 
already expert with the scanning paradigm and are trained to quality-check images during the MRI. 
Immediately after imaging is completed, all scans will be checked for motion artifacts. If necessary, 
patients will be re-scanned on the sequence where excessive motion was detected to ensure proper 
image quality in each individual. All image post-processing will be conducted on a single Mac 
workstation running OSX Lion 10.7.[ADDRESS_140456]-processing irregularities related to the 
use of multiple workstations. All structural brain segmentations and parcellations will be reviewed by 
a trained technician for data quality. DTI and rs-fMRI data are very sensitive to movement artifacts. 
Therefore, we will exclude patients that exceed 2 degrees rotational, and/or 2mm translational 
movement, which are well-recognized cut-off points for movement.(39, 40) 
 23 
 
 
 
Sample Size The total sample size of 50 patients accounts for the likely scenario in which up to 15% of patients 
will not have full datasets due to loss-to-follow-up or unusable MRI data (e.g. patient motion, 
abnormal brain MRIs).  Based upon the results of the phase [ADDRESS_140457] 
that this is an open-label study, we anticipate that approximately 50% of patients will be “responders” 
at 8 weeks. (6-8) Thus, we would have at least [ADDRESS_140458] a difference in 
pain induced BOLD signal of 0.1% pre-erenumab to post-erenumab, assuming a standard deviation of 
0.1. Based on a type I error of .05, a sample size of 21 patients per group will give 88% power to 
detect pre-treatment to post-treatment differences for responders and non-responders. The use of % 
signal change as the measure for calculating effect size is the standard recommendation when 
determining sample size for fMRI studies.(41)  
 
Desmond and Glover, in their paper entitled “Estimating sample size in functional MRI (fMRI) 
neuroimaging studies: statistical power analyses”, used data from fMRI studies of cognitive function 
and somatosensory stimulation to estimate sample sizes needed for fMRI studies. [Desmond 2002] 
They concluded that for a threshold of 0.05, about 12 subjects are required to achieve 80% power at 
the single voxel level for typi[INVESTIGATOR_124976]. However, they state that at more realistic thresholds that 
approach those used after correcting for multiple comparisons, the number of subjects doubles 
(n=24) to maintain this level of power.  
 
As Mumford and colleagues point out, the number of stimulations/events that are included in the 
fMRI paradigm must also be considered when calculating power – the more stimulations/events, the 
greater the power to detect a difference.(41) 
 
Russo et. al. used a similar study design as the one we have proposed to investigate pain-induced 
activations in migraine pre- and post-external trigeminal neurostimulation. [Russo 2017] In the 
Russo study there was a pre- to post-treatment change in pain-induced activation of the anterior 
cingulate of approximately 0.2% with a standard deviation of approximately 0.1%.  Given this effect 
size, a sample size of 16 individuals (81% of whom were responders) was adequate to demonstrate 
significant pre- to post-treatment changes in pain-induced activation of the anterior cingulate cortex. 
 
With limited available data to ensure that our effect size will be as large as 0.2%, we are more 
comfortable powering the analysis for an effect size half of that found in Russo et. al. (i.e. 0.1%).(11) 
The resultant sample size is consistent with that recommended by [CONTACT_124997].(41, 42)  
 
Subject Recruitment and Screening  
 24Subjects will be recruited from the Mayo Clinic Arizona Headache and Neurology clinics, from the 
clinical practices of colleagues practicing in the Phoenix region, and via posting of IRB-approved 
recruitment materials. 
 
 
 
 
Subject Compensation  
Subjects will be compensated $70 per research visit and $[ADDRESS_140459] 
80% compliant with the headache diary (i.e. provide data on at least 80% of days in a 4 week period).  
 
Informed Consent  
Informed consent procedures will be performed according to the requirements and recommendations 
of the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent will be obtained from all 
subjects prior to their participation in this research. The informed consent process will be based upon 
principles discussed in the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with US 21CFR. Applicable 
HIPAA privacy notifications will be included. Participants will be given ample time and opportunities 
to ask questions about this study prior and following consent. All consent forms will require IRB 
approval prior to their use. Patients will always have the right and will be informed of their right to 
withdraw from the study at any time. De-identified data collected until the time of withdrawal will be 
included in further analyses. Enrolling clinicians will be made aware that the needs of their patients 
come first and thus the safety and wellbeing of study participants is of primary concern. The study 
will be done in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and with US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and International Committee for Harmonization guidelines for safety 
monitoring. Any member of the research team who obtains informed consent from a subject will need 
to be approved by [CONTACT_4707].  The informed consent process will occur in a 
location that is approved by [CONTACT_4707]. Consent documents will be stored for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_140460] are 
recorded in the patient’s record. The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing 
medical condition. Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition or underlying disease 
has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration more than would be expected, and/or has an 
association with a significantly worse outcome than expected. A pre-existing condition that has not 
worsened more than anticipated during the study or involves an intervention such as elective 
cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study is not considered an adverse event.  
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious 
criteria: 
 25• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
• requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• other medically important serious event 
 
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],” if the event necessitated an 
admission to a health care facility (e.g., overnight stay). If an investigator considers an event to be 
clinically important, but it does not meet any of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a 
serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event.” Examples of 
such events could include allergic bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reaction, or events that necessitate 
an urgent intervention. 
 
Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious Criteria 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_124998]-up visit ([ADDRESS_140461]) are reported using the 
Adverse Event case report form. The Adverse Event case report form is included within the Appendix 
of this protocol. 
 
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes: 
 adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms) 
 dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) 
 intensity 
 outcome 
 action taken 
 assessment of relatedness to investigational product 
 
Assessment of whether the adverse event is possibly related to the investigational product is 
indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?” 
 
The Adverse Event case report form will be completed by [CONTACT_124999]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124977], indicating that the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124978], determining the relationship of the 
adverse event to the study, and determining if the adverse event meets criteria for a serious adverse 
event.  
 
Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by [CONTACT_125000]-up visit ([ADDRESS_140462]) are recorded 
in the subject’s record and to the local Institutional Review Board according to that Board’s policy.  
 26 
Reporting of adverse events to [COMPANY_010] will occur in accordance with the “Safety Data Exchange 
Requirements” as provided by [CONTACT_11337]. These requirements dictate the need for and timing of 
reporting adverse events to [COMPANY_010]. A copy of the “Safety Data Exchange Requirements” has been 
included within the Appendix of this protocol. 
 
 
Subject Risks and Benefits  
Possible Benefits: 
As this is an open-label study, all participants will receive treatment with erenumab. It is likely that 
many patients will have improvements in their migraine patterns following treatment with 
erenumab, as has been demonstrated in the phase II and III clinical trials and by [CONTACT_125001]. 
 
Possible Risks: 
 
The most common side effects are injection site reaction, constipation, muscle spasm and pruritis.  
With the exception of injection site reaction (5.2%), these side effects were reported by [CONTACT_21316] 5% 
of patients in the phase II and III clinical trials.  Constipation, sometimes with serious complications, 
was reported by [CONTACT_3450]  3% of individuals receiving erenumab. 
 
 
Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported 
following the use of AIMOVIG in the postmarketing setting. Many of the patients had pre-existing 
hypertension or risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring pharmacological treatment 
and, in some cases, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment but was 
most frequently reported within seven days of dose administration. In the majority of the cases, the 
onset or worsening of hypertension was reported after the first dose. 
 The FDA has added a safety-related label change to erenumab to include a contraindication for 
patients with serious hypersensitivity to erenumab or to any of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_124979]. Most hypersensitivity reactions were not serious and occurred within 
hours of administration, although some occurred more than one week after administration. 
 
Hypersensitivity reactions including rash and swelling/edema have been reported with erenumab in 
postmarketing experience. 
 Additional risks that have been reported since erenumab was approved in May 2018 include 
mouth/lip sores and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders such as alopecia and rash. 
 
 
Potential risks associated with erenumab use during pregnancy and lactation are not established.  
 
 27Protected health information (PHI) is being collected. Although measures are taken to reduce the risk, 
it is possible that there could be inappropriate access to the PHI by [CONTACT_125002].  
 
Protection Against Risks: 
 
Individuals who are known to be pregnant or lactating will be excluded from study participation. 
Women of childbearing potential who are not known to be pregnant will have urine pregnancy testing 
before the [ADDRESS_140463] dose of erenumab (details provided in ‘eligibility criteria’ section of 
this protocol). 
 
Measures that will be taken to protect PHI: All information collected from study participants will be 
locked in a secure location. Identifying information will be removed from the data forms and replaced 
by [CONTACT_125003]. Electronic databases/spreadsheets will be password protected and only 
accessible to those with access rights. Data will be entered into REDCap. (43) REDCap is a secure web-
based application used for designing and managing clinical research databases. REDCap’s design 
addresses the National Center for Research Resources statement that the future of biomedical 
research will involve collaborations amongst many scientists in different locations linked by [CONTACT_5019]-
speed computer networks thus enabling data submission, data sharing and data analyses. (43, 44) 
REDCap is accessible to study investigators via any computer with a Web browser. Once data are 
entered into data collection forms, data automatically upload to the registry data file. The registry 
complies with all HIPAA regulations, requires a log-in ID and password, and users only have access to 
specific functions (e.g. view data, add data, change data, etc.) once granted rights for those specific 
functions. Data can be exported into numerous formats utilized by [CONTACT_125004], SAS, R, Excel, Stata and others.  
 
Subject Retention  
Subject retention and diary compliance will be essential for study success.  
 
At the time of considering an individual for participation in this study, it will be ensured that the 
individual will be available for the duration of the study. The responsibilities of the subject will be 
clearly defined. All research visits will be scheduled at the time of enrollment. Subjects will be 
contact[CONTACT_125005]. 
 
Diary compliance will be monitored on a daily basis. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_125006]-
compliance is observed. Individuals who have diary compliance less than 80% during the run-in 
phase will be withdrawn from the study.  
 
Analysis Plans  
Specific Aim #1 (i.e. identify changes in brain structure and function that correlate with response to 
erenumab): Pre-treatment and post-treatment MRI data will be used for within and between subject 
 28comparisons. Within subject analyses will compare baseline brain activation and perfusion patterns 
and functional connectivity patterns pre-treatment to post-treatment. Between subject group 
analyses will compare post-treatment MRI data in erenumab responders to non-responders.  
 
Similar comparisons will be made for pre- and post-treatment pain thresholds (i.e. results of 
quantitative sensory testing) and cognitive testing. 
 
So as to help with the interpretation of differences between responders and non-responders, MRI 
data from erenumab-treated patients will be compared to healthy non-migraine control data that we 
have already collected during the conduction of previous studies, when available (although we have 
plenty of data for the majority of analyses, we have limited ASL data and no n-back data from healthy 
controls). Differences in brain structure and function of migraine patients prior to erenumab 
treatment compared to healthy controls will be identified. Results of this analysis will determine 
alterations of brain structure and functions in migraine patients compared to healthy controls. Areas 
where migraine patients show altered structure and function will be used as regions of interest (ROIs) 
to assess the longitudinal, within-group changes of erenumab responders and non-responders. 
 
Although multiple analyses are planned using functional, structural, and perfusion data, the primary 
analysis for specific aim #[ADDRESS_140464]-treatment changes in other measures of brain function as well as measures of brain perfusion, 
brain structure, cutaneous pain thresholds and cognitive function in those responding to erenumab 
and in those not responding will be explored. 
 
Two–tailed T-Tests or Mann-Whitney U tests will be used to perform group comparisons on 
demographic and cognitive measures and on pain threshold data. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed 
using general linear model designs. Within-group changes on cognitive measures, sensory testing and 
neuroimaging data will be assessed by [CONTACT_2931] a general linear mixed model design. 
 
Specific Aim #2 (i.e. Develop models to predict which patients will respond to erenumab): Pre-treatment 
scans will be used to identify MRI predictors of erenumab response. Multivariate machine-learning 
modeling of brain structural and functional data will be utilized for developi[INVESTIGATOR_124980]. 
Because there are many imaging features available, but only a limited set of patients for this analysis, 
principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed on features collected from each imaging type 
to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The principal components (PCs) that result from PCA are 
linear combinations of the original imaging features, and can consolidate the information from the 
original features in such a way that only a few PCs are needed to explain most of the data variance. 
PCA will be performed separately on features from each imaging type to enhance clinical 
interpretability of PCs chosen for the predictive model.  
 
To maximize the prediction accuracy, we will employ an ensemble learning approach by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a 
number of contemporary and complementary machine learning algorithms for building the predictive 
model, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Support 
Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT). Integrating these algorithms with Particle Swarm 
 29Optimization (PSO)-based feature selection, we will identify the subset of features (PCs) that 
maximizes cross-validated accuracy of predicting responders and non-responders. Feature selection 
is a key step to avoid overfitting when building a predictive model with limited samples. PSO is a bio-
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_124981], e.g., colonies, honeybees, and bird flocks, in finding the optimal feature subset, and 
has been shown to outperform conventional feature selection algorithms in numerous recent 
publications.  
 
Additionally, noting that this study will collect both widely accessible imaging data such as that 
derived from T1-weighted sequences as well as less accessible types such as pain-induced functional 
activations, we aim to determine how widely useable our predictive model is in clinical practice. To 
achieve this goal, we will first limit our PSO-based feature selection to select only PCs derived from 
structural measures of T1-weighted sequences. Then we will compare the accuracy to that of another 
analysis allowed to select resting state functional connectivity data, followed by [CONTACT_125007]. This result will help determine how much value is 
added when using advanced imaging data in predicting treatment response; and if advanced imaging 
is not available in a clinic, how good the predictive accuracy can be. 
 
Patient characteristics, cognitive function, and sensory thresholds can also be included in predictive 
models.  
 
Safety Analysis: The proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events, the nature of the adverse 
events, as well as severity and relationship of the adverse events to the study will be reported using 
descriptive statistics. The proportion of subjects with adverse events that led to withdrawal from the 
study will also be reported. All subjects who received at least one dose of erenumab will be included 
in the safety analysis.  
 
Protocol Maintenance  
Protocol modifications will be approved by [CONTACT_125008]. Modifications will be documented 
separately and within the main protocol document with a newly assigned date and version number. 
 
Study Registration 
 
The study will be submitted to clinicaltrials.gov.

Instructions: 
 
As part of the research in which you are involved, we are going to test how sensitive your skin is to 
heat. The testing will use a pi[INVESTIGATOR_73048], called a thermode.  We will place the thermode at 4 
different locations – each forearm and at [ADDRESS_140479] the thermode on your left forearm.  The thermode will start at about skin 
temperature and then the temperature will gradually increase.  Once it reaches a pre-programmed 
temperature it will hold at that temperature for 7.5 seconds and then you will hear a bell.  At that time we 
will ask you to rate your pain on a scale of 0 to 10 ([ADDRESS_140480] pain imaginable).   
Begin with the average of the left forearm limits test +1°.  
 If subject rates their pain level between 4-7 continue with the non-painful stimulus. 
 If subject rates their pain level as 8 or higher decrease temperature by 0.5° and repeat Ramp & 
Hold (continue to decrease temperature by 0.5° until subject rates their pain level between 4-
7). 
 If subject rates their pain level as 3 or lower increase temperature by 0.5° and repeat Ramp & 
Hold (continue to increase temperature by 0.5° until subject rates their pain level between 4-7).

Temp. Rating (0-10)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
Non-painful Stimulus 
For the next test we will continue with the thermode on your left forearm.  The thermode will start 
at about skin temperature and then the temperature will gradually increase.  Once it reaches a pre-
programmed temperature it will hold at that temperature for 7.[ADDRESS_140481] -2°.  
 If subject answers no continue with MRI instructions.. 
 64 If subject answers yes (that it caused pain) decrease temperature by 0.5° and repeat 
Ramp & Hold (continue to decrease temperature by 0.5° until subject answers no (it 
did not cause pain)). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MRI Stimulations 
During the MRI the thermode will be placed on your left forearm.  For part of the MRI we will be running [ADDRESS_140482] during the tests.

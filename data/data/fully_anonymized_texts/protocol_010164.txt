Section C: Background Information  
Pediatric research in the management of nausea has been limited by [CONTACT_12204] a reliable method to 
quantify the intensity of this subjective symptom. In adults, the visual analo g scale (VAS) is an accurate tool, 
but this has not been show n to be reliable in young children. A scale is a series of points made on a line that 
w ill be used for measurement; a mark on the far left of the line show s liitle pain and the mark on the far ri ght 
means alot of pain. By [CONTACT_561751][INVESTIGATOR_1841]. This measure, how ever, correlates poorly w ith the somatic 
subjective symptom of nausea. Apfel et al  have show n that 30 -40% of adult patients undergoing surgery have 
post discharge nausea and / or vomiting w hile 12% have vomiting. These data on nausea in adults w ere based 
on a visual analog scale for nausea. There are no data on the incidence of postoper ative nausea in children 
since the severity of symptoms are difficult to measure as younger children are know n to be unable to use the 
VAS reliably. Recently a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30422], the Baxter Animated Retching Faces (BARF) 
scale, has been developed and show n to have construct, content and convergent validity as an instrument to 
measure nausea in children. This w as a tw o center study that w as limited to chidlren w ho could speak English. 
The clinical usefulness of this scale in determining th e incidence of postoperative and post -discharge nausea 
in children has yet to be determined including the low est age w here it can be used reliably, the score 
associated w ith a patient's perception of a need for treatment, the minimum change in the scores o f clinical 
relevance and the test -retest reliability w hen nausea is rated as not having changed. The score has also not 
been validated in children w ho speak Spanish. This study is designed to provide the missing information and 
w ill specifically look at th e Spanish speaking population.  
Section D: Purpose and Objectives  
This study in the pediatric Spanish speaking patient population is designed to determine: (1 ) The validity of the 
scale to measure nausea in Spanish speaking children (2) the incidence of po stoperative nausea as compared 
to postoperative vomiting in the Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) and on discharge (Post Discharge nausea 
and Vomiting) in this population (3) The minimal clinically relevant differences in nausea on  
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=374392  9/27/2018  
Human Protocol Report  Page 3 of 11  
the BARF and VAS scales. (4) The BARF and VAS scores associated w ith a patient?s perception of the need 
for treatment. (5) The test - retest reliability of the VAS and B ARF scores w hen nausea is rated as  
unchanged.

Groups to be recruited w ill include:  
Patients  
Which if any of the follow ing vulnerable populations w ill be recruited as subjects?  
Children  
Vulnerable populations require special protections. How  w ill you obtain inf ormed consent, protect subject 
confidentiality, and prevent undue coercion?  
Potental subjects w ill be identified from the surgery schedule at [LOCATION_007] Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_561743]. Parents of potential subjects w ill 
be approached by [CONTACT_561752] w aiting area prior to surgery. After the study is verbally explained, a 
w ritten consent form w ill be provided and time given to allow  consideration of study enrollment. The 
consent  process w ill be conducted w ith emphasis on the voluntary nature of participation and that there is 
no direct benefit from enrollment. If the parents agree, a signed consent w ill be obtained along w ith a 
w ritten assent from the child w hen age appropriate.  
All research data w ill be kept secured and locked up in the office of the research co -ordinator. This office is 
located inside the office of the Department of Anesthesiology at [LOCATION_007] Children?s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This office is only

Section F: Design/Procedure  
F1. Design  
Select one category that most adequately describes your research:  
d) Questionnaire/survey/interview  
Discuss the research design including but not limited to such issues  as: probability of group assignment, 
potential for subject to be randomized to placebo group, use of control subjects, etc.  
The study design is a cross sectional study of Spanish speaking patients undergoing surgery. There w ill be 
no group assignment, no placebo group and each patient w ill be his or her ow n control. Patients w ill receive 
standardized care according to the Attending Anesthesiologist?s opi[INVESTIGATOR_561744]. No changes in clinical practice or care of  patients w ill occur solely for the purpose of the 
study. All patients w ill be asked to assess their pain and nausea using the visual analogue scales, the 
modified faces scale and the BARF scale as described below  in the preoperative and postoperative area s. 
How ever, the order in w hich the scales are presented to the patient for assessment w ill be randomized to 
reduce the potential for an order effect w here the patient choice of a response on one scale may influence 
the response on other scales. For example , having chosen a response tw o -thirds of the w ay up one scale, 
there w ill be a tendency to choose a response tw o -thirds of the w ay up the next scale.  
Inclusion Criteria:  
(1) Spanish speaking children (2) Age > 7 years but below  18 years (3) Elective surgery (4) A merican Society 
of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 -3 (Free from major concurrent disorders) (5) Free from nausea and / or 
vomiting in the previous 24 hours (6)  Cognitive and communicative ability to rate the intensity of symptoms as 
described below .  
Exclusion Criteria:  
(1) Inability to understand or speak Spanish (2) Developmental delay (3) Blindness (4) Impaired cognitive or 
communicative abilities including in ability to rate the intensity of symptoms (5) Surgical procedure w here 
vision or hearing is anticipated to be impaired in the immediate postoperative period (6) Nausea and /or 
vomiting w ithin 24 hours of procedure, (7) Patient or parental refusal to partic ipate (8) Pregnant females  
F2. Procedure  
The subject w ill be consented before further inclusion criteria is determined. We w ill determine if the child 
speaks Spanish. We w ill then determine if the child qualifies for the study by [CONTACT_561753] [ADDRESS_738104] 
remaining size until no more shapes are left. The child w ill then be asked by a Spanish speaking investigator 
to rate the comparative severity of  pain in 3 vignettes -(a) w hen the doctor is listening to the chest, (b) w hen 
the child scraped a knee on the playground and (c) w hen receiving an injection. If the child can perform the 
tasks he / she w ill be considered to have qualified for the study. If  they and the guardian agree to participate, 
w e w ill obtain baseline values as described below .  
Baseline Values: Baseline assessments of nausea before the procedure w ould be obtained from the aw ake 
child using both the visual analogue scale and the BARF sc ale. The order in w hich the first scale is presented 
to the patient for assessment w ill be randomized to reduce the potential for an order effect. The script for the 
scales w ould be standardized in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_561745] w ould be a Spanish translatio n of the 
previously used English script. For the nausea scales, the script w ould be: ?Have you throw n up or felt like 
you w ere going to throw  up before? How  did your tummy feel then? We call that feeling of being sick to the 
stomach as nausea. VAS Scale: O n this line the far left indicates ?No nausea? and the far right? Worst 
nausea ever.? Can you show  me on this line how  much nausea you have right now ? For the Faces Scale, 
the script w ould be: ?These faces show  children w ho feel no nausea at all, w ho feel a little bit nauseous, w ho 
feel even more nauseous, and these are children w ho have a lot of nausea.? (Point to the each face at the 
appropriate time). Which face is more like you right now ?? The evaluator w ill assess if the child has 
understood the instru ctions and has the ability to provide a reliable response.

Intraoperative Care After providing baseline values in the preoperative holding area, the patient's anxiety 
w ould be assessed using the validated modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety scale (mYPAS) [see attachment], 
w hile the child is in the holding area, at the time of separation and w hen the face mask is applied during 
induction of anesthesia. The child w ould receive general anesthesia. The choice of drugs, techniques and 
perioperative management, including the need (if any) for preoperative medication, w ill  be determined by [CONTACT_561754] w ill not be changed for the purposes of the 
study. The patient w ill be monitored in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] w ith the standards and policies of the department of 
Anesthesiology, [LOCATION_007] Chil dren's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We w ill record these drugs, techniques and perioperative 
management.  
Postoperative Care: In the Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) patients w ill receive standard care, including 
analgesic or antiemetic therapy as prescribed by [CONTACT_561755][INVESTIGATOR_561746]. When aw ake, the patients w ill be asked to rate their pain and nausea on both 
scales (VAS and FPS for pain, VAS and BARF for nausea). The order of presentation of scales w ill be t he 
same as in the preoperative area. If a child receives analgesic or antiemetic therapy, he/she w ill be asked to 
rate the pain and nausea immediately before receiving the drug and 30 -60 minutes after receiving 
treatment. In summary, patients w ill rate the ir pain and nausea using the VAS and the FPS -R for pain and 
the VAS and BARF scales for nausea at these time points: (1) before induction of anesthesia, (2) w hen 
aw ake in the PACU, (3) just before and (4) [ADDRESS_738105] assessments are done in the PACU, patients w ill also be asked to rate their nausea on a 5 
point Likert scale as: (1)  Much w orse than before, (2) A little w orse than before, (3) The same as before (4) 
A little better than before and (5) Much better than before. They w ill also be asked if they w ant any 
treatment of their nausea. Another set of assessments w ill be done jus t prior to discharge. All other aspects 
of patient management w ill be the standard care given to such children at the [LOCATION_007] Children?s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Patients w ill be discharged from the PACU w hen they have achieved the standard criteria set for discharge 
at the TCH. At the time of discharge w e w ill give the parents a diary to record the the MAXIMUM nausea on 
the VAS and BARF scales and mail it back in a stamped envelope. We w ill phone them about 24 hours after 
surgery and ask if the child had any nausea, vomiti ng and w hat medications w ere used after going home. 
We w ill ask the parent to rate their satisfaction w ith the control of nausea and w ith the entire perioperative 
experience on a 0 10 scale.We w ill remind them to mail the nausea assessments back and to sta te w hich 
face represented the maximum nausea after discharge.  
Section G: Sample Size/Data Analysis  
G1. Sample Size  
How  many subjects (or specimens, or charts) w ill be used in this study?  
Local: 240  Worldw ide: 240  
Please indicate w hy you chose the sample si ze proposed:  
The pow er analysis w as calculated conservatively for the follow ing hypotheses:  
Hypothesis 1: Nausea scores on the BARF and VAS scales w ould be low er in children after the administration 
of an antiemetic. A reduction in the VAS by 2 cms and by 1 face on a faces scale is considered a clinically 
important reduction in symptoms.(13) Assu ming that the SD of nausea on the VAS scale in children is similar to 
that in adults (2.5 cm) (14), a sample size of [ADDRESS_738106] a 90% pow er at the 0.01 level of significance in 
detecting a 2.0 cm difference in the VAS follow ing antiemetic therapy. Hypot hesis 2: Children w ho received 
rescue antiemetics in the postoperative period w ill have higher postoperative nausea scores on the BARF and 
VAS scales than those w ho did not receive rescue antiemetics. In addition, children w ho required rescue 
antiemetics w ill have higher nausea scores at the time they received the rescue drug in the postoperative 
period than before they developed nausea. In other w ords, nausea scores in the postoperative period w ill be 
higher than scores prior to induction of anesthesia in children w ho received rescue antiemetics. (12) The pow er 
analysis for hypothesis [ADDRESS_738107] a 90% pow er at 
the 0.01 level of significance in detecting a 2.0 cm difference in the VAS.  
Hypothesis  3: There w ill be a good correlation betw een the BARF and VAS scores for nausea. A sample size  
of 127 w ould be estimated for an estimated maximum r of 0.8, a half -w idth of the confidence interval of ? 0.1 
at an alpha of 0.01. (15) These estimates of r are in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] w ith previous studies of the correlation betw een

pain scores on the VAS and the FPS -R scales. (6)  
Allow ing for a 10% rate of dropouts and incomplete data,w e  plan to recruit [ADDRESS_738108] all hypotheses.  
G2. Data Analysis  
Provide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan (e.g. comparison of  
means,comparison of proportions,regressions,analysis of variance). Which is the PRIMARY  
comparison/analysis? How  w ill the analyses proposed re late to the primary purposes of your study?  
Visual analogue scores for pain and for nausea,and FPS -R scores for pain and BARF scores for nausea w ill be 
examined for normal distribution by [CONTACT_561756] -Smirnoff test,but it is anticipated that the distribu tion w ill not 
be normal. Descriptive statistics (mean,median,standard deviation,and frequency distribution) of the nausea 
and pain scores w ill be obtained. The incidence of postdischarge nausea w ill be determined from the responses 
recorded in the diary an d in the follow  up phone call. The construct validity of the BARF scale w ould be 
assessed using the assumption that antiemetics reduce nausea and therefore nausea scores w ould be low er in 
children after the administration of an antiemetic (hypothesis 1). A  subgroup of patients w ho received rescue 
antiemetics in the PACU w ill be examined. The pretreatment and post treatment VAS scores for nausea and 
BARF scores w ill be compared using a Wilcoxon test for non Gaussian distributed data. A reduction of scores 
by [ADDRESS_738109] validation. 
Content validity w ould be assesse d by [CONTACT_561757] w ith nausea w ill score higher on 
these scales than children w ithout nausea (hypothesis 2). We w ill compare the postoperative nausea scores in 
patients w ho received rescue antiemetic therapy w ith the scores in pa tients w ho did not require this therapy 
using the Mann Whitney test. In addition,w e w ill compare preoperative and postoperative BARF and VAS 
scores for nausea in patients w ho received antiemetics,making the assumption that healthy children w ill be free 
from nausea in the preoperative area. The Wilcoxon test for non Gaussian distributed data w ill be used for this 
comparison. Convergent validity w ould be tested by [CONTACT_561758]?s Rho test. The hypothesis tested is that there w ould be a good correlation 
betw een the tw o scales (hypothesis 3). Discriminant validity w ould be tested by [CONTACT_561759]. The hypothesis tested is that there w ould be a poor correlat ion betw een pain and 
nausea scores,particularly after the administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_561747] (hypothesis 4). The correlation 
betw een (1) VAS scores for pain and nausea and (2) pain scores using the FPS -R scale and nausea scores 
using the BARF scale w i ll be determined. Discriminant validity w ould be accepted if the correlation betw een 
these scores is not as good as the correlation betw een (a) VAS score for pain and the FPS score,(b) VAS score 
for nausea and the BARF score. A subgroup of patients w ho rec eived analgesic therapy in the PACU w ill be 
examined. The correlation betw een the change in pain scores and nausea scores w ith analgesic treatment w ill 
be examined using the Spearman?s Rho test. We can anticipate that there w ill be some correlations betw ee n 
nausea and pain as patients w ith pain often have concomitant nausea. How ever,satisfactory treatment of pain 
w ith opi[INVESTIGATOR_561748],as nausea is a side effect of such therapy. 
Similarly,the correlation betw een the change i n pain scores and nausea scores w ith antiemetic treatment w ill be 
examined using the Spearman?s Rho test. The hypothesis tested w ill be accepted if the correlation of VAS and 
FPS-R scores w ill differ from the correlation betw een VAS scores for nausea and B ARF scores. P values below  
0.05 w ill be considered statistically significant. The minimum clinically relevant change in BARF and VAS 
scores for nausea w ill be determined by [CONTACT_561760] w ho rated their nausea to 
be a little  better than before or a little w orse than before. Similarly,the scores at w hich a patient felt the need for 
rescue therapy w ould be determined in those subjects w ho responded positively to a question ?Do you w ant 
any treatment for your nausea?? This w ill provide the threshold score for patient perception of the need for 
rescue therapy. The first and subsequent scores obtained from subjects w ho rated their symptoms as ?no 
change from before? w ill be examined using an intra -class coefficient >0.[ADDRESS_738110] / retest 
reliability.  
Section H: Potential Risks/Discomforts  
Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts;(physical,psychological,social,legal,or other) and assess the 
likelihood and seriousness of such risks:  
The study w ill not invol ve any changes in surgical or anesthetic management of the child. Previous studies of 
pain and nausea in the postoperative period have not show n that repeated questioning of the patient for these  
symptoms has resulted in increased self reporting of pain or  nausea scores and increased rescue therapy. It  
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=374392  9/27/2018  
Human Protocol Report  Page 7 of 11  
is therefore unlikely that the use of the pain and nausea scales w ill result in unnecessary therapy. The 
potential risk of this study includes a breach in confidentiality. All research data w ill be kept secured and 
locked up in the office of t he research co -ordinator. This office is located inside the office of the Department 
of Anesthesiology at [LOCATION_007] Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This office is only accessible by a personal digital access 
cards. Unauthorized individuals w ould not be able to enter thes e facilities. Any electronic data w ill be kept in 
passw ord protected netw ork controlled by [CONTACT_561761]'s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],Department of 
Anesthesiology. Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_381645] w ill be stored in a locked cabinet in the Pediatric Anest hesiology 
office. . Electronic files w ill be maintained on passw ord secured computers. Data w ill be coded.The likelihood 
of such events is minimal.  
Section I: Potential Benefits  
Describe potential benefit(s) to be gained by [CONTACT_30435] a resu lt of participating in the planned  
w ork.  
Patients w ill not have any direct immediate benefits from participating in these studies  
Describe potential benefit(s) to society of the planned w ork.  
Determining the validity of a faces pain scale for Spanish speak ing subjects w ill extend the ability of  
physisicans to use this instrument to rate the severity and need for treatment of subjective symptoms to this 
population rather than being limited to English speaking subjects.  
Do anticipated benefits outw eigh potential risks? Discuss the risk -to-benefit ratio.  
The minimal risks of loss of confidentiality data is exceeded by [CONTACT_561762] a validated tool for measuring nausea in children.

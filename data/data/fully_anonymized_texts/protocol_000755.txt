Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The rationale for this amendment  is to update Section 3, Inclusion Criterion 3a to allow for 
diagnosis of post -COVID -[ADDRESS_625765] (eg, a PCR test) or 
non-laboratory -confirmed COVID -[ADDRESS_625766] (eg, rapid antigen test); this positive result may be 
either documented or patient -reported.

Assessment  Infusion -related reactions  mitigation 
strategy changed from : 
“Monitor participants for 1 hour at the site 
after IMP administration.  IMP will be 
administered by a healthcare professional. ”  
to  
“Monitor participants d uring 
administration and for 30 minutes 
thereafter for clinical signs and symptoms 
of infusion/injection -related reactions. 
Infusion/injection -related reactions are 
considered AEs of clinical interest 
(Section 8.4.7). ” Monitoring requirements updated

10 mg/kg compared to matched -placebo IV in adult participants with post –COVID -19 POTS.  
After an up to 28 -day screening period, eligible participants will be randomized to efgartigimod 
IV 10 mg/kg or placebo in  a 2:1 ratio, respectively, at baseline. IMP will be administered weekly 
during the 24 -week randomized treatment period. At the end of the randomized treatment period, 
eligible participants may roll  over into an open -label extension (OLE) study ARGX -113-2105 or 
remain in this study through the end of the 56 -day follow -up period.  
Number of Participants:  
Approximately 42 participants will be randomized to IMP (efgartigimod IV 10  mg/kg or 
placebo).  
Note: Enrolled means the participant agrees to participate in  the clinical study after completing 
the informed consent process.  
Study Arms and Duration:  
Each participant will participate in the following study periods:  
• Screening period of approximately 4 weeks  
• Treatment period of 24 weeks  
• Follow -up period of appro ximately 8 weeks  (56 days ± 3  days) for participants who 
do not roll over to the OLE study ARGX -113-2105  
Participants will receive IMP weekly during the 24 -week treatment period, with the final weekly 
dose administered at week  23.

argenx  Confidential  22 2. INTRODUCTION  
The study aims to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacodynamics (PD), 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of efgartigimod compared to placebo in 
participants with post –COVID -19 postural orthos tatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)  
(post–COVID -19 POTS ). 
2.1. Study Rationale  
Efgartigimod is a first -in-class antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). 
This binding prevents FcRn from recycling immunoglobulin G (IgG) and leads to a reduction in 
circulating disease -causing autoantibodies. Approved by [CONTACT_2165] 
(FDA) in the US for use in adult patients with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody -positive 
generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) efgartigimod is being clinically developed in other 
autoimmune diseases mediated by [CONTACT_486940].  
Efgartigimod may be a viable treatment option for individuals diagnosed with post–COVID -[ADDRESS_625781] -acute sequelae 
of SARS -CoV -2 syndrome. Typi [INVESTIGATOR_486921] -COVID include breathlessness, fatigue, 
cognitive impairment (eg, brain fog), orthostatic intolerance, and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814].[ADDRESS_625782] long -lasting symptoms after recovery from the initial 
SARS -CoV -2 infection has been identified in several case reports.5,6 A POTS diagnosis is based 
on evaluations for excessive orthostatic tachycardia (sustained heart rate [HR] increment of not 
less than 30 beats/minute [bpm] within 10 minutes of standing or head -up tilt [≥40 bpm in 12 to 
19 years old]); absence of orthostat ic hypotension; frequent symptoms of orthostatic intolerance 
during standing, with rapid improvement upon return to a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]; duration of symptoms 
for ≥3 months; and absence of other conditions explaining sinus tachycardia.[ADDRESS_625783] –COVID -[ADDRESS_625784] –
COVID -19 POTS. Pharmacologic therapy mainly focuses on orthostatic symptoms, targeting 
blood volume expansion and stabilizing HR and blood pressure; however, POTS may be related 
to immune dysfunction and autoimmunity preceded by [CONTACT_80601].[ADDRESS_625785] a higher prevalence of autoantib odies, including ganglionic AChR antibody 
G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) antibodies, which could increase sympathetic tone by 
[CONTACT_486941]: 2.0, Status: Approved, Document ID: VV-TMF-[ADDRESS_625786] –COVID -19 POTS could be caused by [CONTACT_486942]. The aim of this  phase 2 study is to evaluate if 
efgartigimod is safe and efficacious in treating the autonomic symptoms and clinical 
manifestations of autonomic dysfunction in patients diagnosed with POTS after COVID -19.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmaco logy, efficacy, and safety of efgartigimod is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected adverse events (AEs) of efgartigimod may be found in the current efgartigimod IB.  
2.3.1.  Risk Assessment  
Overall, available data confirm that efgartigimod IV has been well -tolerated across studies in 
different indications and has an acceptable safety profile.  
Potential clinically 
significant risk  Summ ary of data/rationale for risk  Mitigation strategy  
Serious infection  Efgartigimod reduces IgG levels, 
potentially hindering immune response 
and increasing the infection risk.  Exclude participants with 
clinically significant uncontrolled 
infections, malignancies, or 
certain viral infections 
(Section  5.2). 
Monitor for infections, considered 
an AE of special interest (AESI) 
(Section  8.4.6 ), and temporarily 
interrupt IMP dosing as specified 
in Section  7.1.2 . 
Infusion -related 
reactions (IRR)  All therapeutic proteins can elicit 
immune responses, potentially resulting 
in hypersensitivity or allergic reactions 
such as rash, urticaria, angioedema, 
serum sickness, and anaphylactoid or  
anaphylactic reactions.  Monitor participants during 
administration and for 30 minutes 
thereafter for clinical signs and 
symptoms of infusion/injection -
related reactions. 
Infusion/injection -related 
reactions are considered AEs of 
clinical interest (Section  8.4.7 ). 
Infusion/injection -
site reactions  Most AEs have been mild, transient 
injection site reactions, including 
erythema, pain, bruising, pruritus, 
burning, tenderness, edema, induration, Contin uously monitor participants 
for injection site reactions.

irritation, paresthesia, numbness, and 
rash. Moderate injection site reactions 
occurring less frequently include burning, 
erythema, pain, and numbness. Mild to 
moderate headache is commonly reported.  Infusion/injection -site reactions 
are considered AEs of clinical 
interest (Section  8.4.7 ). 
2.3.2.  Benefit Assessment  
Efgartigimod has been investigated in nonclinical studies, phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies 
in healthy subjects, and phase 2 -3 clinical studies in patients with IgG -driven autoimmune 
diseases, including gMG, primary immune thrombo cytopenia (ITP), chronic inflammatory 
demyelinating polyneuropathy, myositis, and pemphigus.  
In clinical studies, efgartigimod effectively reduces IgG antibody levels, including pathogenic 
autoantibodies. The efficacy of efgartigimod to improve clinical o utcomes in gMG and reduce 
pathogenic autoantibodies was confirmed in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 study in participants with gMG 
(ARGX -113-1704). In addition, clinical benefit was  observed in phase 2 studies in primary ITP 
(ARGX -113-1603) and pemphigus (ARGX -113-1701 ), in which pathogenic autoantibodies 
underlie the disease pathology (see current efgartigimod IB). The available clinical data support 
the clinical benefit of efgartigimod for reducing pathogenic IgG autoantibodies, which may 
mitigate autonomic dysfunctio n and improve symptoms and the ability to function in patients 
with post –COVID -[ADDRESS_625787] –COVID -19 POTS in this study and considering the measures 
implemented to minimize risks. The favorable balance between risks and anticipated 
efficacy/benefit supports the use of efgartigimod in the clinical development for post –COVID -19 
POTS . 
Detailed information is provided in the efgartigimod IB on the known and expected benefits and 
risks and reasonably expected AEs from efgartigimod clinical studies .

4.1. Overall Design  
This is a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, phase 2 study.  
The total study duration is approximately 36  weeks comprising:  
• Screening period of approximately 4  weeks  
• Treatment period of 24 weeks  
• Follow -up period of  approximately 8 weeks (56 days ± 3 days) for participants who 
do not roll over to the open -label extension (OLE) study ARGX -113-[ADDRESS_625788] –COVID -19. 
Participants will be randomized to receive efgar tigimod IV 10 mg/kg or matching placebo in a 
2:1 ratio, respectively.  
IMP (efgartigimod or matching placebo) will be administered during the treatment period  in an 
approximately 1 -hour IV infusion  once weekly  by [CONTACT_121947] a home nurse.  The final dose w ill 
be administered at week  23. 
At week 24, eligible participants may roll over into a single -arm OLE ARGX -113-2105.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of weekly infusions of efgartigimod IV 
10 mg/kg compared to matched -placebo IV in adult participants with post –COVID -[ADDRESS_625789] –COVID -[ADDRESS_625790]-COVID -19 POTS and efficacy as assessed by [CONTACT_17974] 24 in 
COMPASS 31 (2 -week recall version) and the MaPS. Safety and tolerability are included as a 
primary endpoint as efgartigimod has not been previously administered in this patient 
population.  
COMPASS 31 is a quantitative measure of autonomic symptoms developed for use in autonomic 
research and clinical practice.16 It is a self -rated questionnaire with 31 questions in 6 domains 
(orthostatic intolerance, vasomotor, secretomotor, gastrointestinal, bladder, and pupi[INVESTIGATOR_10440]) 
(Section  8.2.1 ).  
The MaPS score, recently reported by [CONTACT_486943], is a dedicated POTS symptom 
scoring questionnaire.17 The score consists of 12 questions that assess symptom burden related 
and unrelated to orthostatic intolerance (related: tachycardia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], di zziness, presyncope; 
unrelated: gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, insomnia, concentration difficulties) (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).

assessment of autonomic (COMPASS 31) and POTS -specific symptoms (MaPS). COMPASS  [ADDRESS_625791] –COVID -19 with evidence of 
POTS and other forms of dysautonomia.21,22 The MaPS questionnaire was developed specifically 
for patients with POTS by [CONTACT_486944]åne University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Lund University in 
Malmö, Sweden. The 12 -item evaluation score is being evaluated in a case -control study in 
patients with POTS compared  to healthy controls (A. Fedorowski, unpublished data, 2022). 
MaPS is expected to provide an accurate assessment of POTS symptoms over time. Further 
validation of the score will be accomplished by [CONTACT_486945] 31 and the other 
measures include d in this study.  
All secondary endpoints complement the primary efficacy endpoints and provide additional 
information on efficacy, including measures of patients’ assessment of disease severity and 
change over time (PGI -S and PGI -C) and an established ass essment of fatigue (PROMIS 
Fatigue), which is a common symptom among patients with POTS.15  
4.3. Justification for Dos e 
Weekly doses of efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg will be administered to achieve a maximal total IgG 
reduction (PD effect), thereby [CONTACT_486946].  
As the hypothesis for treating post –COVID -[ADDRESS_625792] (ie, reduction of pathogenic IgGs). Considering the chronic nature of post –COVID -19 
POTS, the dosing regimen of weekly IV administration refle cts the need for chronic treatment to 
maintain pathogenic IgG autoantibody suppression and symptom reduction.  
The cumulative data from a phase 1 study in healthy adult subjects; phase 2 studies in 
participants with gMG, ITP, and pemphigus; phase 3 studies in gMG; and PK/PD modeling 
results demonstrate that a 10 mg/kg efgartigimod dose administered weekly (q7d) through IV 
infusion achieved approximately 70% IgG reduction, including pathogenic autoantibodies. 
Maximal IgG reduction was associated with clinical  efficacy observed in gMG, ITP, and 
pemphigus studies. Furthermore, this dose has been safe and well -tolerated in all study 
populations and has demonstrated similar PK and PD profiles across indications. Accordingly, 
the 10 mg/kg weekly IV dose regimen was  selected for this study.  
4.4. End-of-Study Definition  
The end of study is defined as the date of the last participant’s last visit.  
A participant will have completed the study if the treatment period (or follow -up period, if 
applicable) has been completed.

5.3. Lifestyle Considerations  
5.3.1.  Meals an d Dietary Restrictions  
No restrictions apply.  
5.3.2.  Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco  
No restrictions apply except for those described in the exclusion criteria (Section  5.2, exclusion 
criterion 17). 
5.3.3.  Activity  
Participants will not initiate a new physical rehab ilitation or other physician -prescribed exercise 
programs during the 24 -week treatment period (See Section  5.2, exclusion criterion  20). 
5.4. Screen Failures  
A screen failure occurs when a participant who has signed the ICF is not assigned to IMP. A 
minimal set of screen failure information (demography, s creen failure details, eligibility criteria, 
SAE reports) is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants and address 
regulatory authority queries.  
• Retesting: Participants with exclusionary clinical laboratory results, ECGs, vit al sign 
measurements, etc that are inconsistent with their medical history or clinical 
evaluation, can be retested once within the remaining screening period to confirm the 
test value(s).  
• Rescreening: Participants who do not initially meet this study’s el igibility criteria can 
be rescreened once. For example, a participant who does not meet eligibility criteria 
because of an acute illness ongoing during screening (considering the illness itself 
does not violate inclusion/exclusion criteria), they can be re screened once the illness 
is resolved or the medical issue stabilized. Rescreened participants will be 
reconsented and assigned a new participant number for each rescreening event.

DISCONTINUATION/WITH DRAWAL  
Discontinuation of specific sites or the entire study is described in Appendix 1 (Section  10.1). 
7.1. IMP  Discontinuation  
7.1.1.  Permanent Discontinuation  
Permanent discontinuation of IMP occurs when the participant stops receiving IMP before the 
end of the study  and does not resume receiving IMP . The participant also must  not have  
withdraw n informed consent.  
The investigator will document the primary reason for early discontinuation of IMP.  
Participants who permanently discontinue IMP will be encouraged to remain in the study and 
attend any previously scheduled visits , even if only by [CONTACT_756]. Participants unwilling to 
participat e in on -site visits for AE and concomitant medication monitoring will be offered the 
option to attend these visits by [CONTACT_486949]. If the participant cannot 
attend the previously scheduled visits for any reason, the study site will minimally perform the 
EDV and the SFV  on-site. 
Unless consent from the study has been withdraw n, the participant will attend an EDV and an 
SFV. Study sites will attempt to perform the EDV within  [ADDRESS_625804] with the 
participant . The SFV will occur  56 ±3 days after the participant’s final IMP administration.  
The following circumstances will result in the permanent discontinuation of IMP:  
• Participant becomes pregnant or intends to become pregnant ( refer to  Section  8.3.5 ) 
• Investigator decides that  discontinuing IMP is in the participant’s best interest (the 
sponsor will be informed)  
• Participant develops a n SAE or AE that contraindicates further ad ministration of IMP 
in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_486925] ( NCI-CTCAE) grade 4 that is considered 
related to IMP by [CONTACT_456]  
• Participant develops a new or recurrent malignancy except for basal cell carcinoma of 
the skin, regardless of relationship  
• The participant receives a prohibited medication or substance  (Section  6.9.1 ) 
Participants permanently discontinuing IMP will be ineligible to roll over into the OLE study.  
7.1.2.  Temporary Discontinuation  
Temporary discontinuation of IMP occurs when the participant discontinues receiving IMP 
before the end of the study and resume s once the  cause for the discontinuation has been resolved.  
Reasons for temporary discontinuation  may include an AE that meets the following criteria :  
• Any SAE considered related to IMP by [CONTACT_486950]: 2.0, Status: Approved, Document ID: VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE]

argenx  Confidential  39 • Clinically significant active infection considered related to the  IMP by [CONTACT_456]  
7.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Study w ithdrawal is defined as the permanent cessation of further participation in any study 
assessment before its planned completion.  
The primary reason for permanent  study  withdraw al will be recorded.  
The following circumstances will result in permanent discontinuation and withdrawal from the 
study:  
• Participant withdraw al of consent  
• Sponsor  request  
If the participant also withdraws consent to participate in future research, the spon sor can retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such consent was withdrawn.  
• Samples collected from participants who have withdrawn from the study will be used 
for the study results but not for future research.  
Participants withdrawn from the study will be ineligible to roll over into the OLE study.  
7.3. Lost to Follow -up 
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if they repeatedly fail to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298].  
The following actions must be completed if a participant fails to complete  a required study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_14315], counsel the participant on the importance of maintainin g the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the participant wishes to continue in the 
study.  
• Before a participant is considered  lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (when poss ible, 3 phone calls, 
and if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_237352]’s medical record.  
− Participants who continue to be unreachab le will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study , and will be recorded as lost to follow -up.

Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section  1.3). Protocol  waivers or 
exemptions are not allowed.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA (Section  1.3), 
is essential and required for study conduct.  
Visits that must be attended on -site are SCN, BL, W1, W2, W4, W12, W24, IMP discontinuation 
visit, EDV, and SFV. All other visits may occur at the participant’ s home (Appendix  6, 
Section  10.6)  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants 
meet all eligibility  criteria before randomization. The investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
Operational considerations due to the COVID -19 pan demic are provided in Section  10.5. Per 
local health authority/ethics requirements, the sponsor/designee or the investigator may 
implement alternate st rategies for participant visits, assessments, medication distribution, and 
monitoring.  
8.1. Administrative and General/Baseline  Procedures  
All significant findings, surgeries, and pre -existing conditions (including allergies) present at 
screening will be report ed. Complete information will be collected on medical and surgical 
history and concomitant medical conditions and specifying those ongoing at screening.  
Details collected as a part of the medical history must include but are not limited to all previous 
treatment/therapy for COVID -[ADDRESS_625805] –COVID -19 POTS.  
Questionnaires will be administered before any other assessment, if applicable for that visit. If 
applicable, all other assessments will be completed after the questionnaires and before the 
infusion excep t the postdose PK blood sample.  
All assessments will be completed before administering the IMP infusion.  
8.1.1.  Screening  
Eligibility is based on a change in orthostatic HR with either active stand testing or head -up tilt 
testing, consistent with consensus criter ia (Section  5.1, criterion  3.a) (Shelton).15,[ADDRESS_625806] consent to their samples being used

additional medical, academic, or scientific research to address any scientific questions related to 
efgartigimod, FcRn biology, or POTS, unless this would not be allowed according to local 
regulations or the participant would not have agreed.  
8.2. Efficacy  Assessments  
Time points for all efficacy assessments are provided in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
Questionnaires should be administered before any other study assessment and may be completed 
up to 1 day before the visit.  
Please see the Investigator Site File for instructions on administering these assessments.  
8.2.1.  Questionnaires  
[IP_ADDRESS].  COMPASS 31  
COMPASS 31 i s an easily scored questionnaire to evaluate the severity and distribution of 
autonomic symptoms in various autonomic nerve disorders, providing clinically relevant scores 
of autonomic symptom severity. The questionnaire is based on the well -established 16 9-item 
Autonomic Symptom Profile (ASP) and the validated 84 -question scoring instrument, the 
Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS).16 The COMPASS 31 questionnaire has 
been previously used to assess patients with POTS.19,20 
The 31 -item question naire requires approximately 10 minutes to administer and addresses 
6 domains: orthostatic intolerance, vasomotor, secretomotor, bladder, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_10440], and 
gastrointestinal -mixed upper and diarrhea.  
The original version of COMPASS 31 (longer recall) will be administered at screening and the 
modified version (2 -week recall) will be administered at baseline and all other time points.  
Higher scores indicate a more severe degree of autonomic symptoms.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  MaPS  
The MaPS has been developed to assess the severity of the most common symptoms found in 
patients with POTS based on clinical experience and literature (A. Fedorowski, unpublished 
data, 2022). The score consists  of 12 questions that assess symptom burden related (tachycardia, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dizziness, presyncop e) and unrelated to orthostatic intolerance (GI symptoms, 
insomnia, concentration difficulties).  
Participants will grade their symptoms for the past 7 days using a visual analog scale (VAS) 
ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (worst possible). The maximum s core is 120 points, with 
higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. In general, patients with POTS score 
>[ADDRESS_625808] lower values. A score >90 points indicates 
debilitating/severe symptoms.

The PGI -S and PG I-C questionnaires are simple, participant -rated, single -item global measures 
of their perceived condition.  
• PGI-S: Severity of symptoms over the past week and overall experience of symptoms 
over the past 2  weeks (2  week recall) are both rated on a 4 -point Likert scale, with 
scores ranging from 1 (none) to 4 (severe)  
• PGI-C: Overall change in symptoms from the start of IMP to time point is rated on a 
7-point Likert scale, with scores ranging from 1 (much better) to 7 (much worse)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  PROMIS  
PROMIS is a publicly a vailable system of highly reliable, precise patient -reported health status 
measures of physical, mental, and social well -being. PROMIS instruments measure concepts 
including pain, fatigue, and physical function.  
• PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 8a: assesses the i mpact and perceived fatigue during the 
last 7 days. This validated 8 -question scale has 5 response options, with scores 
ranging from 1 to 5. Scores are converted to a T -score, and higher scores indicate 
higher fatigue levels. A decrease in score (negative change from baseline) indicates 
improvement in fatigue.

See Appendix 2 ( Table  2) for the list of cli nical laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA 
(Section  1.3) for the timing and frequency.  
The investigator must review the laboratory results, do cument this review, and record any 
clinically significant changes occurring during the study as an AE. The laboratory results must 
be retained with source documents.  
Abnormal laboratory findings associated with the underlying disease are not considered 
clinically significant unless judged by [CONTACT_41411]’s condition.  
8.3.5.  Pregnancy Testing  
WOCBP will be tested for pregnancy by [CONTACT_486951]. Urine tests for pregnancy will occur

Reporting  
The definitions of AE a nd SAE are provided in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). An AESI is an AE of 
scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program and described in 
Section  8.4.6 . 
AEs (including SAEs, AESIs, and AEs of clinical interest) will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, 
if appropriate, by [CONTACT_486953]).  
The investigator and qualified designees are responsible for detec ting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE  or SAE and  monitoring all reported events, 
including those reported by [CONTACT_2299].  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing the causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
proce dures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 
(Section  10.3). 
8.4.1.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All AEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the SFV, as specified in the SoA 
(Section  1.3). 
All SAEs and AESIs will be rec orded and reported to the sponsor  or designee immediately, and 
under no circumstance will this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3 (Section  10.3). The 
investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_625810] promptly notify the 
sponsor.  
8.4.2.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is preferred to inquire about AE occurrences.  
8.4.3.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE re port, the investigator must proactively follow each participant at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and AESIs ( defined in Section  8.4.6 ) will be f ollowed until 
resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up 
(defined in Section  7.3). Further  information on follow -up procedures is provided in

[IP_ADDRESS].  Infusion/Injection -Related Reactions  
All therapeutic proteins can elicit immune responses, potentially resulting in hypersensitivity or 
allergic reactions such as rash, urticaria, angioedema, serum sickness, and anaphylactoid or 
anaphylactic reactions. As with any SC or IV injection, injection - or infusion -related reactions 
can occur during or after administration.  
Overall, the frequenc y of injection -related reactions in clinical studies has been low.   
The efgartigimod IB provides more information on infusion -/injection related reactions.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Injection Site Reaction  
An injection site reaction is any AE developi[INVESTIGATOR_486927] . Localized injection 
site reactions were frequently observed in studies in which efgartigimod and PH20 were 
administered SC. The most frequently reported injection site reaction AEs were Injection site 
erythema , Injection site pain , and Injection site swe lling.   
Any injection site reaction will be reported as an AE (Section  8.4). Certain types of local 
reactions may be photographed and shared with the sponsor for review and assessment.  
As a routine precaution, participants will be trained or observed closely by a tr ained health care 
professional for any potential injection -site reaction.  
Refer to the current IB for more information on injection site reactions.  
8.5. Pharmacokinetics  
Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points specified  in the SoA

(SOC) and  preferred term (PT).  
• Multiple occurrences of a single PT in a participant  will be counted only once at  the 
maximum severity/grade.  
• AEs with missing severity or relationship to IMP will be classified as severe and 
treatment -related, respectively. All AEs will be summarized by  [CONTACT_350193].  
• Any AEs leading to death or dis continuation of IMP will also be summarized.  
• Population PK/PD analysis may be performed based on the PK and PD data and 
reported separately.  
• Laboratory parameters, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, ECG data, 
and PK, PD, immunogenicity, and bi omarker results will be analyzed descriptively.  
9.4. Interim Analysis  
An unblinded interim analysis may be conducted mid -course at the sponsor/designee’s 
discretion. Results will be available to senior sponsor/designee staff only while maintaining the 
clinical study team members’ blind to IMP assignment.  
9.5. Sample Size Determination

The study start date is the date when the clinical study will be open for recruitment 
of participants upon th e availability of mandatory approvals.  
The sponsor/designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor/designee. Study sites will be closed upon 
study completion. A stu dy site is considered closed when all required documents and study 
supplies have been collected and a study site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and enough a dvanced notice provided of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_456]/designee may include but are not 
limited to:  
• Inability to achieve the recruitment target within a reasonable time  
• Determination that no furthe r benefits are expected from the study (in the 
sponsor/designee’s judgment)  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC 
or local health authorities, the sponsor/designee’s procedures, or GCP guidelines  
• Discontin uation of further study medication development  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor/designee will promptly inform 
the investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, designee, and any vendors used 
in the study of  the reason for termination or suspension as specified by [CONTACT_56859]. The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and assure appropriate 
participant therapy and/or follow up.

10.4.1.  Women of Childbearing Potential Definition  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential (WOCBP) unless she is either:  
• Postmenopausal:  
− continuous amenorrhe a for ≥1 year without an alternative medical cause  
− FSH >40  IU/L  
If a postmenopausal woman is using hormonal therapy, such as hormone replacement 
therapy or hormonal contraceptives, FSH levels could be suppressed and therefore an FSH 
test to confirm a postmenopausal state is not considered valid. In this case the 
postmenopausal state will be assessed by [CONTACT_093].  
• Surgically sterilized: documented permanent sterilization procedure (eg, 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or bilateral oophorect omy)  
10.4.2.  Contraception Guidance  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Female Contraception for Women of Childbearing Potential  
WOCBP must use one of the following contraception methods from signing the ICF until the last 
dose of IMP.  
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen containing) hormonal contrac eption associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:  
− Oral 
− Intravaginal  
− Transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
− Oral 
− Injectable  
− Implantable  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
• Sexual abstinence: a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the IMP. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to  be evaluated concerning the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant

1.  PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decreasing Suicide Risk among Service Members with Posttraumatic Stress Using Written [ADDRESS_94607] shown that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent 12 
condition and that service members who screen positive for PTSD are more than twice as likely to make a suicide 13 
attempt (Hoge et al., 2004; Nock et al., 2014). Research has shown that evidence- based PTSD treatments can 14 
reduce suicidal ideation (Gradus, Suvak, Wisco, Marx, & Resick, 2013; Bryan et al., 2016); however, it is challenging 15 
to provide these treatments to high- risk service members on an acute inpatient unit because they require more time 16 
and resources than are typi[INVESTIGATOR_86822].  Written Exposure Therapy (WET)  is an evidence- 17 
based,  5-session treatment for managing PTSD ( Sloan et al., 2018) . WET , adapted for treatment of co- morbid PTSD 18 
and su icidality,  may overcome many implementation challenges  in an inpatient acute care treatment setting (e.g., [ADDRESS_94608], nominal time needed to train therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], treatment brevity, and low attrition) . 20 
Additionally, pi [INVESTIGATOR_86823]. To directly target suicidal risk and PTSD this 21 
study will use a new formulation of WET referred to as WET -for suicide, or WET -S, that includes crisis response 22 
planning (CRP) for suicide prevention to  the WET condition. W ET-S will be delivered in a condensed or “massed’ [ADDRESS_94609] one WET -S session each day.  24 
 25 
The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to  determine if five 60-minute sessions of Written Exposure 26 
Therapy for Suicide ( WET -S) reduces the presence, frequency, and severity of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, 27 
suicide gestures, suicide attempts, non- suicidal self -injurious behaviors, and re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86824] 28 
WET -S reduces posttraumatic stress ( PTS) symptom severity among 124 service members and veterans admitted to 29 
an acute psychiatric inpatient unit for co -morbid suicide ideation  (SI) or attempt and PTSD or posttraumatic stress 30 
(PTS) compared with Treatment as Usual ( TAU). Treatment will be adm inistered during the acute inpatient stay and, [ADDRESS_94610]-treatment, and then 1- and 4-months after treatment completi on.  33

 36 
Purpose:   The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy of five 60-minute sessions 37 
of Written Exposure Therapy for Suicide ( WET -S) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) compared with TAU in high- risk, 38 
suicidal service members , veterans , and DEERS eligible beneficiaries  with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or 39 
posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS S). 40 
 41 
Research Aims and Hypotheses:    42 
Aim 1 : Determine if Written Exposure Therapy for Suicide (WET -S) reduces the presence, frequency, and severity of 43 
suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide gestures, suicide attempts, non- suicidal self -injurious behaviors, and re- 44 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86825] -Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI; Nock et al., 45 
2007) among service members ,veterans , and DEERS eligible beneficiaries   admitted to an acute psychiatric 46 
inpatient unit for suicidal ideation (SI) and/or attempt with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or posttraumatic 47 
stress symptoms (PTS S) compared with Treatment as Usual (TAU).  48 
Hypothesis 1. Compared with TAU  alone , WET -S + TAU will result in significantly greater reductions in 49 
suicide -related outcomes pre -treatment to 1- and 4- months follow -up. 50 
 51 
Aim 2: Determine if Written Exposure Therapy for Suicide (WET -S) reduces posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) 52 
severity measured by [CONTACT_25976]- 5 (CAPS- 5; Weathers, Blake, Schnur r, 53 
Kaloupek, Marx & Keane, 2013) among service members , veterans , and DEERS eligible beneficiaries   admitted 54

  Page 2 of 14 Hypothesis 2. Compared with TAU  alone , WET -S + TAU will result in significantly greater reductions in [ADDRESS_94611] -treatment, 1- month, and 4- month follow -up. 58 
 59 
Aim 3: Determine if reductions in posttraumatic stress  symptoms  (PTSS) severity  mediate the association between 60 
treatment condition and suicide- related outcomes (suicidal ideation, plans, gestures, attempts, non- suicidal self - 61 
injurious behaviors, and re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) measured by [CONTACT_25976]- 5 (CAPS- 62 
5) and the Self -Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI).  63 
Hypothesis 3. WET -S + TAU will demonstrate an indirect effect on suicide- related outcomes through greater [ADDRESS_94612] unacceptably high rates of suicidal behavior and PTSD. The 69 
military’s immediate and long- term mission readiness would benefit from a brief, easily implemented, evidence- 70 
based intervention that meaningfully reduces the future risk of suicide among service members  with PTSD and 71 
improves morale. Active duty work and schedule demands require efficient treatment delivery models (e.g., 72 
treatment delivered in a condensed format of consecutive daily sessions) and psychiatric inpatient treatment 73 
focused on suicide risk stabilization is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a short time period. Because WET -S is brief, easy to administer, and 74 
requires fewer resources and training to administer, it could very easily be scaled up and disseminated. This 75 
advantage would allow service members to engage in this therapeutic technique in a variety of settings (e.g., home, 76 
barracks, in theatre) with a high degree of privacy and a significantly reduced effort by [CONTACT_86835] [ADDRESS_94613] targets 78 
active duty military personnel at varying stages of psychiatric care: the inpatient stay, the high- risk p ost-discharge [ADDRESS_94614] shown that PTSD is a prevalent condition and that service members 87 
who screen positive for the disorder are more than twice as likely to make a suicide attempt (Hoge et al., 2004; Nock 88 
et al., 2014). Research has shown that evidence- based PTSD treatments can reduce suicidal ideation (Gradus, 89 
Suvak, Wisco, Marx, & Resick, 2013; Bryan et al., 2016); however, it is challenging to provide most of these [ADDRESS_94615] that treatment as usual in inpatient psychiatric settings reduces the likelihood of suicide after  discharge.  94 
 95 
WET  is a 5-session treatment that is included in the 2017 VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for managing PTSD 96 
(2017). WET is associated with large within- and between- group effect sizes that are comparable with other 97 
evidence- based PTSD treatments (Sloan, Marx, et al., 2018). Sloa n and colleagues (2012) examined the efficacy of [ADDRESS_94616] (WL) comparison condition delivered to men and women who had a diagnosis of PTSD 99 
related to a motor vehicle accident. Intent to treat findings indicated a very large between group differences (Cohen’s 100 
d = 2.[ADDRESS_94617] ively), with 91% of participants no longer meeting 101 
diagnostic criteria for PTSD 6 months following treatment (Sloan et al., 2012). Moreover, WET was associated with 102 
low attrition (n = 2; 9%) and high treatment satisfaction ratings. Next, WET was compared w ith Cognitive Processing [ADDRESS_94618] - line PTSD treatment that is much more time intensive than WET, in a non- inferiority trial. 104 
Participants in both treatment s displayed a significant reduction in PTSD symptom severity (large within group ef fect 105 
sizes) .  However, a significant treatment condition difference in dropout  was also observed, with 39% dropout in CPT 106 
compared with 6% in WET (Sloan et al. (2018). Thus, WET may overcome many implementation challenges in an 107 
inpatient acute care treatment setting (e.g., minimal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -patient contact, nominal time needed to train therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], 108 
treatment brevity, and low attrition). Preliminary data suggest that WET also reduces suicidal ideation. Specifically, 109 
secondary analysis of data from the WET vs.  CPT study  sample demonstrated that among those who received WET  110 
and who endorsed SI at baseline (n = 18 of 63; 28.57%), a significant effect of linear time was observed (B = 0.338, 111 
SE = 0.07, p<.001), indicating that participants were significantly less likely to endorse SI over time. Roughly half of 112 
those who endorsed SI  at baseline no longer endorsed SI 60 weeks later . 113

  Page 3 of 14 To directly target suicidal risk and PTSD among service members admitted to an acute psychiatric inpatient unit  the 115 
study will use a new formulation of WET referred to as WET -for suicide or WET -S that includes crisis response 116 
planning (CRP) for suicide prevention to the WET condition. CRP is a brief strategy that reduces suicide attempts 117 
among military personnel by 76% compared with typi[INVESTIGATOR_86826] (Bryan et al., 2017a). 118 
CRP also  contributes to significantly faster reductions in suicide ideation (Bryan et al., 2017a), as well as immediate 119 
reductions in emotional distress and suicidal intent (Bryan et al., 2017b). WET -S aims to work synergistically by 120 
addressing trauma- related symptoms or cognitive- affective states (e.g., intrusive thoughts, self -blame, hyperarousal) 121 
that are both PTSD treatment targets and warning signs for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Bryan, 2016; Bryan, 122 
Grove, & Kimbrel, 2017). The development and review of CRP aims to support the regulation of these trauma- 123 
focused cognitive- affective states (among other patient warning signs) while the patient engages in trauma- focused 124 
treatment through the WET protocol.  125 
 126 
WET -S will be delivered in a condensed or “massed’ treatment format, consisting of at least one WET -S session 127 
each day. For some patients, two WET -S sessions per day may be considered with the objective  that the protocol 128 
is completed prior to discharge. Recent data support condensed formats version of evidenced -based cognitive 129 
behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_86827] (weekly) version with significantly less dropout (Foa 130 
et al., 2018; Fredman et al., 2018; Peterson et al., 2018). Although primary data exist to support reductions in suicide 131 
risk with WET, it has yet to be tested with patients at high risk for suicide requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 132 
management. Therefore, as a part of risk management strategies for the experimental treatment of WET with this 133 
population we are including increased suicide risk monitoring and management by [CONTACT_86836] 134 
condition (WET -S). WET -S will be delivered in five sessions, with the allowance of an additional two WET -S [ADDRESS_94619] with the COVID -19 pandemic, all assessment and treatment sessions for this 142 
study will occur using a computer or tablet talking over a secure line in real -time with the research staff using a 143 
computer in his or her office. The video telehealth platform used for these communications is HIPAA -compliant. 144 
While participants are in care at the CRDAMC inpatient unit, the computer or tablet will be provided by [CONTACT_86837] 145 
use for study procedures only. For sessions or assessment that occur after participants are discharged from inpatient 146 
care, participants will need to use a computer with high speed internet access (e.g., broad- band internet connection [ADDRESS_94620] 384kbps at 720 pi[INVESTIGATOR_41463]) to support the telehealth platform. The computer must be equipped with speakers [ADDRESS_94621] access to a computer in a private location, t hey 151

Written Exposure Therapy -for Suicide (WET -S). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897],  WET -S consists of [ADDRESS_94630] 90 minutes. Each session includes a 252 
written exposure exercise for participants randomized to the WET+TAU arm. The first s ession will consist of the [ADDRESS_94631] while being monitored by [CONTACT_86840]. The participant 261 
will be provided with the writing instructions and the provider will remain virtually connected with the patient while the 262 
writing session is completed.   Writing instructions begin with a focus on describing the details of the trauma and 263 
emotions and thoughts that occurred during the traumatic event and then change to a focus on the  meaning of the 264 
trauma event (e.g., what the event has meant to the person, how it has changed the way they view his or her life). [ADDRESS_94632] and supervising investigators, 1 to 2 additional WET -S 266 
sessions will be provided to ensure the rationale of WET -S as a treatment for PTSD is understood by [CONTACT_2299] 267 
and to allow for a full course of WET -S sessions. WET -S will be delivered in a condensed or “massed’ treatment [ADDRESS_94633] one WET -S session each day until the treatment is complete.  For some  participants , 269 
two WET -S sessions per day may be considered to complete the protocol prior to discharge  if possible . However, i f 270 
participants are discharged from inpatient care prior to completing the WET -S protocol, WET -S will continue  using a 271 
secure HIPAA -compliant video telehealth platform.  272 
 273 
 274 
WET -S treatment also includes the development and monitoring of a Crisis Response Plan (CRP) for suicide risk. 275 
Participants assigned to WET -S will complete the CRP prior to beginning their writing in session 1. Patient use of the 276 
CRP since the previous session will be briefly reviewed at the start of each WET -S session to manage safety and 277 
problem solve fluctuations in risk during treatment.  278

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86830]. The planned statistical design includes fixed effects for treatment (between- 382 
groups), time (within- subjects), and the group by [CONTACT_6491]. This latter effect captures differences in changes over 383 
time between the groups; as such it is the effect of substantive interest in each of the models that will be examined. 384 
Advantages of the general(ized) linear mixed effects model include the ability to include cases with missing data 385 
(assumed missing at random), flexible specification of the covariance structure among the repeated measures, the ability 386 
to model nonlinear trajectories of change over time, and the ability to perform between- and within- groups contrasts both 387 
at and across assessments to examine significant group by [CONTACT_25218]. Prior to performing statistical analyses, the 388 
data will be inspected to determine the advisability of scale transformation to normalize distributions (where applicable) [ADDRESS_94648] h ypothesis 3, growth curve modeling will be used to examine mediation. Specifically, treatment condition will be 391 
entered as a predictor of change in both PTS symptom severity and suicide related outcomes. To achieve mediation, 392 
WET -S +TAU would achieve superior reductions in suicide related outcomes and PTS symptom severity relative to TAU [ADDRESS_94649] would allow us to conclude that WET -S + TAU’s superior effect on 395 
suicide risk relative to TAU only is mediated by [CONTACT_86846].  396

7.7.2 Long Term Data Storage.  A STRONG STAR Repository has been approved by [CONTACT_86847] 409 
(HSC20100475H) IRB to enable the STRONG STAR Consortium to store specimens and data for future use. The 410 
STRONG STAR Repository  is a large comprehensive database of information, biological specimens and 411 
neuroimages related to the identification, assessment, and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 412 
insomnia, pain, and related behavioral health conditions.  All information entered into the STRONG STAR Repository  413 
will be extracted from primary datasets collected as part of IRB -approved studies, including this study, being 414 
conducted and /or supported in collaboration with the UTHSCSA STRONG STAR Consortium.  Study databases are [ADDRESS_94652] their data placed in the STRONG 420 
STAR Repository  will be maintained under the UTHSCSA IRB -approved Repository protocol.  For participants who 421 
decline participation in the STRONG STAR Repository , at the conclusion of the study their data will be de- identified 422 
and the data maintained in the Repository without identifiers.  423

  Page 9 of 14 • Possibility of becoming emotionally upset or experiencing an initial increase of PTSD symptoms due to the 436 
discussion or journaling of traumatic events.  437 
 438 
Rare and Serious (expected to occur in less than 5 out of 100 participants):  439 
• With the handling of medical and research records there is always the possibility of a breach of [ADDRESS_94654] participant records.  442 
• Assessment and therapy sessions that are conducted via video telehealth are subject to risks to [ADDRESS_94655], 447 
participants will be encouraged to use headphones and to find a quiet area of the home to hold the 448 
encounter. Also, although video telehealth sessions are transmitted securely, there is always a risk that 449 
others (not affiliated with this research) could breach the network security systems and access the 450 
information. Ensuring that the participant has a virus protection on his or her computer will minimize this risk.  451 
• It is possible that technical difficulties will result in missing a scheduled treatment session. The research [ADDRESS_94656] 18 years of age, able to be contact[CONTACT_86848]'s [ADDRESS_94657] operating procedure for managing suicide risk 476 
after discharge that includes scheduled a written safety plan for patients and behavioral health appointments for 477 
follow -up care and medication management within CRDAMC outpatient Department of Behavioral Health.    478 
When participants are seen by [CONTACT_464], severe suicidal ideation could also be addressed through the 479 
development of a Crisis Response Plan and/or referral to local resources for additional information.  Priority will be [ADDRESS_94658] that the procedures used in this study are associated with immediate decreases in emotional distress and/or [ADDRESS_94659] ensured that all procedures and data storage 488 
methods are secure. Access to data is restricted to research staff on an as -needed basis, research staff are trained 489 
regularly in confidentiality and privacy issues, research staff participate in weekly supervision, and quality assurance 490 
checks are conducted annually.  491

15.0 Description of Assessments : 666 
1. Supplemental Demographic Form_v1.0 :  The Demographics Form queries eight standard demographics and 667 
military service information  not part of the Military Suicide Research Consortium (MSRC) Common 668 
Demographics (e. g., height, weight, military grade, type of military service, etc) .   669 
 670 
2. Military Suicide Research Consor tium (MSRC) Common Demographics : The MSRC Common Demographics 671 
(CDem) were developed by [CONTACT_86850].  As a requirement of funding, the research team is  required to administer 672 
these questionnaire  and upload a limited data set (with dates but without other patient identifiers) as a SPSS file [ADDRESS_94671] demographics (race, gender, age) and military service information (e.g., rank) .    675 
 676 
3. Military Suicide Research Consortium ( MSRC ) Common Data Elements:  The MSRC Data Elements (CDEs) 677 
were developed by [CONTACT_86850].  As a requirement of funding, the research team is required to administer  these 678 
questionnaire and upload a limited data set (with dates but without other patient identifiers) as a SPSS file to the 679 
MSRC website. The MSRC CDEs is a 91 item self -report questionnaire compromised of questions related to 680 
self-injurious thoughts, behaviors and related psychopathology.  681 
 682 
 683 
4. Health Interview : The original Health Care Utilization (HCU) is a 16- item questionnaire developed in [ADDRESS_94672]. 684 
Patricia A. Resick’s NIH grant, “Cognitive Processes in PTSD: Treatment II.” The questionnaire was based on [ADDRESS_94673] 688 
psychiatric medication, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and outpatient medical services, as well as items intended to assess 689 
changes in participants’ military status. Tobacco/nicotine use will also be queried.  690 
 691 
5. Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI): The SITBI (Nock, Holmberg, Photos, & Michel, 2007) is [ADDRESS_94674] reliability, and concurrent validity (Nock et al., 2007).  696 
 697 
6. Depressive Symptoms Index -Suicidality Subscale (DSI -SS):  The DSI -SS (Metalsky  & Joiner, 1997) will be used [ADDRESS_94675] two weeks (for baseline and follow up visits) or the past week (for interim assessment visits). A systematic 703 
review of measures of suicidal ideation and behaviors found that the DSI -SS had evidence of excellent internal 704 
consistency and concurrent validity (Batterham et al., 2014).   705 
 706 
7. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM- 5 (CAPS- 5; Weathers, Blake, Schnurr, Kaloupek, Marx, & 707 
Keane, 2012) : The CAPS- 5 is structured interview that assesses the DSM- 5 criteria for PTSD (Weathers et al., 708 
2013). Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Extreme/incapacitating) and [ADDRESS_94676] for evaluating PTSD and 714 
demonstrated good reliability and validity (Weathers, Keane, & Davidson, 2001). In addition to reflecting 715 
diagnostic changes for PTSD in DSM- 5, the CAPS -5 differs from the CAPS in that frequency and intensity 716 
ratings for each symptom are no longer scored separately, so the severity rating for each item determines 717 
whether a symptom is present or not. Subscale scores are calculated by [CONTACT_86851] 718 
the following PTSD symptom clusters: re- experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, 719 
and hyperarousal. Scores ≥ 25 indicate a probable diagnosis of PTSD.  720 
 721 
Version: 07-27-[ADDRESS_94677] -5 (LEC -5): The LEC includes a list of 24 potentially traumatic life events commonly 722 
associated with PTSD symptoms. The instrument was designed to facilitate the diagnosis of PTSD (Weathers, 723 
Blake, Schnurr, Kaloupek, Marx, & Keane, 2013a).). In this study, the LEC -5 will also be used to identify the 724 
index event and focus of the PTSD treatment. For each potentially traumatic life event, respondents rate their 725 
experience of that event on a 5- point nominal scale (1 = happened to me, 2 = witnessed it, 3 = learned about it, 726 
4 =part of my job, 5= not sure, and 6 = does not apply). Each nominal point will be scored separately, as either 0 727 
(=not endorsed by [CONTACT_3445]) or 1 (=endorsed by [CONTACT_3445]).  [ADDRESS_94678] -5 (PCL -5): The PCL- 5 (Weathers, et al., 2010) is a 20- item self -report measure update of the [ADDRESS_94679] month (for baseline and follow up assessments) or the past week (all 733 
interim assessments) as a result of a specific life event.  Each item of the PCL- 5 is scored on a five point scale 734 
ranging from 0 “not at all”) to 4 (“extremely).  735

10. Deployment Risk and Resiliency Inventory -2 (DRRI -2) Combat Experiences subscale and DRRI -2 Postbattle 737 
Experiences subscales:: The DRRI -2 (Vogt, et al., 2013) is a suite of 17 individual scales that assess key 738 
deployment -related risk and resilience factors with demonstrated implications for veterans’ long- term 739 
health.   The Combat Experiences and Postbattle Experiences subscales will be used to assess stressful 740 
deployment experiences.  741 
 742

11. Monetary -Choice Questionnaire (MCQ): The MCQ (Kirby [CONTACT_2297]., 1999) is a 27- item self -administered [ADDRESS_94680]. The measure is scored by [CONTACT_86852]’s answers place 746 
him/her amid reference discounting curves, where placement amid steeper curves indicates higher levels of 747 
impulsivity.  748 
 749 
12. Suicide Cognition Scale Short Form (SCS- S): The SCS -S is a 9 -item self -report measure designed to assess 750 
suicide -specific thoughts and belief, with demonstrated reliability and validity with chronic pain patients (Bryan et 751 
al., 2016). The SCS -S evaluates how much an individual agrees with the suicide- related cognition. Scores on 752 
each item range from 1- 5, with higher scores reflecting greater severity.   753 
 754 
13. Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI):  The PTCI is a 36- item questionnaire that was developed to 755 
determine how an individual views the trauma and its sequelae in an attempt to understand both how PTSD 756 
develops and is maintained (Foa, Elhers, Clark, Tolin, & Orsillo, 1999).  Using an emotional processing theory, 757 
Foa and her colleagues (1999) have suggested that PTSD is a consequence of disruptions in the normal 758 
processes of recovery when an individual has excessively rigid concepts about self and world rendering the 759 
person vulnerable if a traumatic event occurs.  Thus the PTCI was developed as a measure of trauma- related 760 
thoughts and beliefs.  It is comprised of three subscales (Negative Cognitions about the Self, Negative 761 
Cognitions about the World, and Se lf-Blame).  The measure was tested in almost 600 adult volunteers recruited 762 
from two university PTSD treatment clinics as well as a university community.  Approximately 65% (n=392) of 763 
individuals reported having experienced a trauma in which their own life or that of another person was perceived 764 
to be in danger and their response at the time included intense terror, horror, or helplessness (Criterion A event).  765 
The remaining 35% (n=162) denied such a traumatic experience.  Of those who had experienced a trauma, [ADDRESS_94681] moderate severity while the remaining 185 reported a low symptom severity.  767 
The three subscales of the PTCI demonstrated internal consistency with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.86 to 768 
0.97.  Convergent validity was  demonstrated comparing the PTCI to appropriate subscales of the World 769 
Assumptions Scale and Personal Beliefs and Reactions Scale.  Significant correlations between the appropriate 770 
subscales ranged from 0.20 to 0.85.  The PTCI was able to differentiate individuals with and without PTSD 771 
demonstrating discriminate validity (sensitivity = 0.78, specificity = 0.93).  Test –retest reliability for each of the 772 
three subscales at a 1- week interval ranged from 0.75 to 0.89 and for a 3- week interval ranged from 0.80 t o 773 
0.86.  774

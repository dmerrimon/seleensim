I. PURPOSE OF STUDY  
Patients frequently inquire about when they can safely resume driving after undergoing orthopaedic 
and spi[INVESTIGATOR_404869].  Compromise of any of the cognitive, neurological and musculoskeletal 
systems involved in operating a vehicle can significantly hinder one 's ability to safely drive.  There has 
been increasing interest in the literature regarding ability to safely drive following orthopaedic and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477], with numerous studies analyzing the impact of a variety of orthopaedic interventions  
on d riving performance. However, there have been no  well-designed studies elucidating an 
appropriate timeframe to resume driving after cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477].  As a result, no evidence -based 
recommendations exist to determine a patient’s “fitness to drive” in the periop erative or 
postoperative state. Using a validated driving simulator, the goal of this study is to delineate the effect 
cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_404870].  
 
Subjects who are indicated for cervica l spi[INVESTIGATOR_404871] . If the 
subject meets all of the eligibility criteria and agrees to participate in the study after informed consent, 
they will be enrolled  to complete multiple phases of testing with the driving s imulator set -up.   
Subjects will be divided into the following groups: single -level anterior cervical discectomy  fusion (s -
ACDF), multi -level anterior cervical discectomy  and fusion (m -ACDF), cervical disc replacement (CDR), 
posterior laminectomy and fusio n (PCLF), posterior cervical decompression procedure (PCD).  Each  
group will contain a total of [ADDRESS_510506] on patient’s driving ability 
after  cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477].  We believe that pre-operative and post -operative clinical and 
functional measures will have an impact on driving performance.  Pre-operative measures include 
pre-operative driving performance  measures , neck disability  index ( NDI), PROMIS , numeric pain 
rating scale (NRS), pre-operative diagnosis, comorbidities, clinical and physi cal exam measure s, 
maximum axial rotation of neck and torso,  narcotic usage, questionnaire responses and 
demographic information.  Post -operative measures include post -operative driving performance, 
type of surgery, complications, radiological outcomes, ne ck disability  index ( NDI), PROMIS , numeric 
pain rating scale (NRS), clinical and physical exam measures, maximum axial rotation of neck and 
torso , narcotic usage and questionnaire responses.  
II. BACKGROUND  
Degenerativ e changes in the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_404872] -aged and elderly population (1 -3).  An estimated 50% of patients with symptomatic cervical 
disc disease report  moderate  to severe disability while driving  (4).  From  1990 to 2000, the total 
number of cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_404873]  (2), with recent data 
showing cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_404874] 206% among Medicare  
beneficiaries from 1992 to 2005  (5).  Given the increasing amount of cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_404875] , it is  common for patients to inquire about their ability to drive after surgery.  
 
Driving is a multi -system task that requires cognitive coordination of a variety of co mplex and 
coordinated muscular actions. The safe operation of a motor vehicle requires the driver to have 
adequate range of motion of the extremities to perform steering, braking, reversing and 
maneuvering of the vehicle.  Automobile accidents are a signif icant cause of death and injury in the 
Page 3 of 21 #s15 -[ZIP_CODE] : Driving After Cervical Spi[INVESTIGATOR_404868]: 
 Version 1. 9 June  11th, 2018  Yong Kim , MD  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
[LOCATION_002] with over ten million accidents every year and human error being a contributing factor 
in over 90% of all cases ( 6-9). In the [LOCATION_002], both the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs 
(CEJA) of the  American Medical Association and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA) describe the central responsibility of physicians to assess physical and mental impairments 
that m ight adversely affect driving (9 ).  The importance of establishing ev idence -based guidelines is 
critical because the term ‘fitness to drive’ represents a multi -faceted issue with medical, legal and 
financial implications.  
While guidelines for driving following numerous orthopaedic procedures related to the upper and 
lower e xtremities have been substantiated by [CONTACT_404898] ( 10-17) there is a paucity of quality 
research in the context of surgical procedures of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. A majority of studies related to driving 
performance after spi[INVESTIGATOR_404876] a  simple analysis  of break reaction time  (BRT)or driving 
reaction time (DRT) (used interchangeably in the literature) to extrapolate driving performance.   
 
Al-khayer demonstrated delayed  DRT following selective nerve root block  (SNRB)  in patients with 
lower extremity radicular symptoms , which returned to pre -operative values at [ADDRESS_510507] -SNRB  
(18).Two studies have evaluated driving reaction time  in patients with lumbar radiculopathy 
undergoing micro -lumbar discectomy  (MLD)  (19, 20 ).  In both studies, mean patient D RT was 
significantly s lower than in controls at all time points ; however, MLD was shown to improve DRT and 
severity of back pain was found to have a negative affect on DRT  (19).  A follow -up study by [CONTACT_404899] -
operative paresis  (20). Given the immediate post -operative improvement in DRT and lack of a 
generally accepted threshold for DRT, the authors concluded that it is safe to continue driving after 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_404877].  Similarly, Liebensteiner  et al measured driving performance after 
lumbar fusion surgery using DRT as the primary study end -point (21 ).  The authors reported  no 
significant difference in DRT in the immediate post -operative period; however, they did note that at 
3-month  follow -up there was a significant improvement in DRT, with back pain having a negative 
affect on DRT .  Based on these findings and the lack of an accepted guideline for optimal DRT, the 
authors concluded that patients could be permitted to continue drivin g in the immediate 
postoperative period.  
 
Only two studies have  evaluated driving performance following cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_404878] .  Lechner et al. evaluated brake reaction time and neck/arm pain pre -
operatively,  a day prior to discharge and [ADDRESS_510508] -operatively (22 ).  The authors stated that 
it appears to be safe to resume driving after discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. However, patients scheduled 
to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF ) should b e informed about increased DRT 
as compared to healthy individuals.  Similarly, Wang and colleagues compared DRT in 37 patients at 
2, 6 and 12 -weeks following lumbar and cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_404879]  (23).  Patients 
undergoing multi -level lumbar  fusion and posterior cervical surgery were found to have  delayed DRT 
at baseline, with no significant improvement post -operatively.  However, patients undergoing single -
level lumbar fusion surgery were found to have significant improvements in DRT in the early post -
operative period.  Based on the ir findings, the authors concluded that it may be acceptable to allow 
patients having a single -level lumbar fusion who are not taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_404880] [ADDRESS_510509] hoc analysis of patients’ self -reported driving disability from neck pain  via NDI measur es on 
patients involved in an investigational device exemption study of ACDF and cervical arthroplasty .  
Page 4 of 21 #s15 -[ZIP_CODE] : Driving After Cervical Spi[INVESTIGATOR_404868]: 
 Version 1. 9 June  11th, 2018  Yong Kim , MD  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
The authors found that  80% of ACDF patients and 92% cervical disc arthroplasty patients reported 
none or little disability when driving at [ADDRESS_510510] postoperative 
time point recorded in their study (4).  
Truly evaluating a patient’s ability to drive can only be evaluated in actual real -world driving 
scenarios, however, given the public safety risk  and legal implications , a real -world experimental 
driving trial is not feasible.  The use of the STISIM driving simulator, complete with computerized 
driving scenarios and driving hardware, has been validated in numerous studies ( 24-28) and allows 
for a more comprehensive  inves tigation of driving performance .  The simulated course recreate s 
standard turns, traffic intersections, pedestrian crosswalks, lane changes and several hazardous 
conditions routinely encountered during driving situations.   The robust data collection featur e of 
this simulator allows for the creation of customized circuits, which can measure vehicle road 
position, average speed, driving reaction time and collisions encountered.  
It is our hypothesis that in evaluating a patient’s safety to return to driving af ter cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_84017] , there are numerous outcomes that would require investigation. The patient’s pain and 
disability measures will  likely play a role in the patient’s ability to adequately operate a steering 
wheel  and depressing the break pedal .  Th is can be due to residual motor weakness and pain 
encountered when utilizing the upper extremities second ary to myelopathy  or nerve root 
compression .  This can be investigated by [CONTACT_404900] s cenarios tha t require evasive maneuvering.   
Another critical factor is the patient’s cervical and thoracic range of motion both pre -operatively and 
post -operatively.  Adequate neck and torso range of motion is critical for performing driving tasks 
such as evaluating intersections, changing lanes and reversing.  Studies suggest that reduced range 
of motion (ROM) and maximum angular velocity (MV) of head rotation have a negative impact on 
driving ( 29).Numerous studies have shown that c ervical range of  motion is decreased after both 
anterior and posterior cervical procedures,  when compared  to that of healthy controls (30, 31 ).  
Increasing the number of cervical levels that are fused progressively decreased the active cervical 
range of motion of the pati ent.  A recent clinical study revealed that there are significant step -wise 
decreases in cervical range of motion when comparing 1, 2, 3, and 4 level ACDFs to controls. Cervical 
axial rotation decreased from 7 to 31  degrees  with increasing levels of fusion s.  This study also 
revealed that in the early postoperative period defined as about 110 days postoperatively there was 
still approximately a 12% decrease in both cervical flexion and extension and a 12% decrease in axia l 
rotation (29 ).Via the use multiple  monitors to create an [ADDRESS_510511] on driving performance in the perioperative time period.

IV. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
A. TRIAL ORGANIZATION  
The study will be conducted at a single institution: [LOCATION_001] University Langone Medical Center – 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53066]. Surgeries will be conducted at NYU -HJD and [LOCATION_001] Un iversity 
Langone Medical Center, while patient follow up  and visits will occur at the  NYU Center for 
Musculoskeletal Care . 
B. INVESTIGATORS  
All patient s are recruited through the NYU Department of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_404881] s.  Patients who meet inclusion criter ia and are seen for clinical visits 
and post -operative follow -up at the Center for Musculoskeletal Care and Madison Orthopedic 
Surgery Center will be consented and taken to the Center  for Musculoskeletal Care  Rehabilitation 
Center which houses the driving simulator apparatus. Patients will be  consented by [CONTACT_093], 
persons completing research fellowships in orthopaedic surgery and/or persons working exclusively 
on clinical orthopaedic research projects. These researchers all have experience seeing and 
consenting patients. These patient s will be consented if they meet inclusion criteria.  Surgeries will 
occur at [LOCATION_001] University - Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_404882] .  
C. PATIENT SELECTION  
STUDY SUBJECTS  
This will be a prospective  experimental model  study. All non-control study participants will be 
patients seen b y the NYU Department of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_404883] s. The same care will be provided independent of the patient’s willingness to be a part 
of the study. Pati ents will be [ADDRESS_510512] of care delivered by [CONTACT_4520]. No ethnicities will be prohibited from participating in the study. Males and females 
will participate in the study as close to a 1:1 ratio as possible.  Operative patients who are required 
to complete research activity for four visits will be compensated. Patients from the CMC office and 
Madison Orthopedics office will be compensated $50 for all four visits. Patients who regularly see 
their physician at fa rther office sites including but not limited to Seaport Orthopedics and Long 
Island Branches will be compensated $100 for all four visits . Optional visits in this study will not be 
compensate d. If all four visits are not completed, patients will be compensated at the end of their 
participation in accordance with the percent of visits they completed.  IRB approved study 
advertisement will be used to better reach patients.  
 
 
Payment for Participation

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
Subjects will be reimbursed using Greenphire ClinCard  which will  allow reimbursement and 
notification to patients instantly as mentioned in the Study Subjects section above.   
 
Using Greenphire ClinCard instead of cash or money orders will reduce subjects’ drop out. It will 
provide direct reimbursement to eliminate the financial hurdles that may keep participants from 
completing study visits. It will provide subjects wit h instant access to cash via a reloadable debit 
card. Subjects will be asked to provide their social security number  or Alien Registration number , 
date of birth , and address . This is a requirement for participating in the Greenphire program as this 
informa tion is needed for federal tax purposes and without this information, subjects cannot sign up 
the study. We do not anticipate that this will deter patients from enrolling.  Optional visits in the 
study will not be reimbursed.  
 
 
CONTROL SUBJECTS  
[ADDRESS_510513].  Given there will be restricted cervical range of motion 
when utilizing a cervical collar, the cervical control group will serve two purposes:  
1) To elucidate whether the cervical range of motion restrictions result in decreased range of motion 
versus a healthy control popu lation when surveying traffic for blind spots.  
2) To elucidate whether cervical range of motion restrictions results in decreased driving performance 
in terms of driving simulator output as compared to a healthy control population.  
 
Volunteers  will not re ceive financial compensation for their participation  as only one sitting is 
required . Compensation will be given to subjects who need to return for follow up visits based on the 
extent of their travel requirements.  
 
 
SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA  
Patients/subjects are free to withdraw at any time from the study.  New subjects will be recruited to 
replace them.

operative period.   
I. ADVERSE EVENTS /RISKS 
There are no significant risks associated with this study.  The driving simulator set -up has been used 
in three previous studies by [CONTACT_404901].  The 
simulated driving scenario can potentially result in motion sickness dur ing the trial.  Additionally, 
there is the possibility that axial rotation of the neck and/or torso may cause the patient discomfort 
when driving.  
J. PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS 
The study subjects will be instructed to inform the research coordinator if they exp erience motion 
sickness or discomfort. T he simulated trials will be stopped immediately  and the study subject will 
be asked if they would like to complete the trial.  If the study subject does not wish to complete the 
trial, they will have the option to co mplete the trial at a later date or be removed from the study.   
The investigators are familiar with the protocol and have utilized this driving simulator in previous 
studies . For data collection, the research coordinator is knowledgeable in the field of or thopaedic 
care and clinical research. All personnel have completed CITI training and the investigators have a 
dedicated staff and nurse to attend to the patient’s medical and psychological needs if needed. If 
patients require medical monitoring, ancillary care, or equipment, patients will be able to seek care 
in case of an emergency at the NYU -HJD Immediate Care Center, which  is open 24/7. The research 
coordinator, will also be available to patients during regular office hours.  
K. INVESTIGATION SCHEDULE AND FO LLOW -UP 
Data will be collected regarding i ndividual patient demographics,pre -operative diagnosis, procedure 
and driving history at the pre -operative and first post -operative time period.  P atient -reported 
outcome instruments (NDI, PROMIS  , NRS), physical e xam measures, narcotic usage, driving 
performance measures, a post -simulated driving questionnaire and maximal axial rotation of the 
neck and torso will be collected at all time points. The EQ5D and mJOA survey  will be collected only

from myelopathy patients at baseline, 3 month, and 6 month. This  data will be recorded onto a de -
identified data collection sheet by [CONTACT_41314]. The patient data sheets will then be entered into 
a protected electronic database, while the data sheets will be stored as a back -up until the study is 
complete. Once the completed database is analyzed and summarized, the results will be presented 
to the involved participants without any identifiable patient information.  Follow -up will b e the 
investigator s’ routine follow -up at [ADDRESS_510515] -operatively.  The 6

M. INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
A patient of the investigators’ will be asked to participate in the study if they both meet the 
inclusion criteria and not the exclusion criteria. The patients will be given an informed consent form, 
which  will also be explained orally by [CONTACT_093]/ research coordinator. Documentation of 
informed consent will occur by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_007] a hard copy of each informed consent form that is signed 
and initialed by [CONTACT_423]. In addition, the research coordinator will fill out an informed consent 
documentation proce ss form similar to the one as follows:  
 “Subject _____ has been enrolled in the study _____ on _____. The study was explained to the 
subject by [CONTACT_60572] _____. The subject was given a copy of the consent whereby [CONTACT_404902] t he subject and his/her family member. The subject and the family 
were given an opportunity to ask questions of his surgeon. A signed copy of the consent was given 
to the subject/family. Consent was obtained prior to the performance of any study procedures. " 
These will also be kept in a binder that is locked in a secure office that will only be access by [CONTACT_25617].

volunteers.   The driving -simulator  experimental set -up will consist of the subject sitting in front of 
the driving simulator wi th three screens allowing for an 180° field -of-view  with a camera positioned 
overhead; the subject will have markers placed over shoulders and head to all ow for motion -capture 
analysis with objects placed at various locations to simulate blind spots. Figur e 1 summarizes the 
experimental set -up.Table 1 summarizes all outcome measures and data collection timeline.  
 
 
Figure  1: Experimental Set -Up 
Driving Simulator  
A driving simulator will be utilized to reproduce “typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]” driving conditions in an automatic 
transmission vehicle.  To assess the change in driving performance, a previously established testing 
model with software and hardware set -up will be employed (32 -34).  Specifically, automobile 
components of the driving simulator included brake and accelera tor pedals connected to a brake 
cylinder and force transducer, an adjustable steering column, and an adjustable car seat.  The pedal 
assembly is connected to an analog to digital converter that transmits positional information to the 
computer. Three monito rs (Dell, Round Rock, TX ) will be utilized to create  a 180° field -of-view with 
the center of the screen located at eye -level through the midline of the subject.  Surround speakers 
(Dell, Round Rock, TX) will be utilized to produce road sounds and to issue instructions to the 
subject. Labview software (National Instruments, Austin, TX) will be used to collect and display data 
via an analog or digital board (AT -EIO-64, National Instruments, Austin, TX) with a sampling rate of 
1,[ADDRESS_510517] V3.0 software (Systems 
Technology, Hawthorne, CA) will be used for acclimatizing subjects to the software as well as testing

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
subjects in simulated real -world driving conditions.  Car and steering responses will be recor ded 
with STISIM software. Data will be collected for specific events during the programmed driving 
scenario. Each subject will be allowed a single training circuit to familiarize to the simulator prior to 
any data collection.  Patients will undergo testing  using a simulated driving circuit (SDC) lasting 
approximately fifteen minutes.  The SDC is designed to represent a combination of suburban, 
highway and residential driving environments.  The course will recreate standard turns, traffic 
intersections, pede strian crosswalks, lane changes and several hazardous conditions routinely 
encountered during driving situations.  Patients will be instructed to stay below the indicated speed 
limit.  In the event that subjects exceeded this limit, a computer -generated au ditory warning will be 
issued.  There will be pre -programmed prompts during the circuit to indicate to the driver to 
perform specific maneuvers (change lanes, turn at intersection, come to full stop). Subjects will be 
informed that the simulator could make  them feel uncomfortable and they will be instructed to 
inform the experimenter if this happens, at which point, the scenario will be stopped immediately.  
 
Measurement of Cervical Rotation  
Cervical axial rotation will be recorded using an overhead camera (Canon, Melville, NY) positioned  
over the simulator set -up as graphically depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 2. Four video markers will be placed on

placed on the ground to serve as reference points as depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1.  Video motion analysis 
software (Dartfish, Atlanta, GA) will be used to measure cervical and thoracic rotation using the 
static ground video markers as a re ference.  Prior to beginning each trial, painless maximal axial 
rotation of the neck and torso will collected by [CONTACT_404904]:  
1. While keepi[INVESTIGATOR_404885], please rotate your head as far right as you c an, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_404886]. Now repeat, by [CONTACT_404905], stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_404886]. (maximal axial rotation of neck)  
2. While keepi[INVESTIGATOR_404887], please rotate your body as far right as you can, stoppin g at the

The amount of rotation during each specified lane change or turning  event during each testing 
interval will be collect ed and recorded.  Additionally, the time required to achieve maximal rotation 
and time required prior to initiating and completing a lane change will be collected.  Finally, t he 
average and maximal amount of axial  range of motion will be collected over eac h testing interval 
and compared.

Lane Changes and Blind Spot Detection  
Visual inspection of the rearview and side mirrors and the blind spot using appropriate eye –head 
movements is generally needed before ta king the decision to change lanes (35 ). The driving scenario 
will include [ADDRESS_510518] 
Traffic Safety Administration (Figure 3 ) from experimental analysis of blind spot position for 75 
vehicles, four multi -colored LED lights (AOMEtech, Guangzhou , China) will be placed in constant 
locations relative to the subjec t to simulate the blind spot (36).  The lights have a control feature, 
which allows the operator to change the color remotely.  Prior to testing, subjects will be instructed 
that a “green” light will signify that there are no vehicles in the blind spot  and a “red” light will 
signify t hat there is a vehicle in the blind spot (See Figure 1 for depi[INVESTIGATOR_182513]) . Prior to beginning the 
trials, patients will be instructed to check appropriate blind spots prior to all lane -changing events. If 
a subject changes lanes without checking the appropriat e blind spot or changes lanes when a vehicle 
appears in a particular blind spot, an unsafe driving event (UDE) will be recorded.  The total amount 
of UDE occurrences will be recorded for each patient in each trial. The appearance of vehicles in 
each blind spot will be remain constant for all patients in each particular phase of testing (i.e. pre -
operative) however, locations will be randomized across each subsequent trial (i.e. 2, [ADDRESS_510519] -operatively) to prevent learning bias.

Measurement of Driving Performance  
In addition to the number of unsafe driving events (UDE), driving pe rformance will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_404908], the number of centerline crossings, and the number of 
off road excursions.  Total collisions encompass both “off -road” collisions, when patients veer too 
far laterally from the comp uterized boundaries of the driving circuit, and “on -road” collisions, which 
occur if a patient’s vehicle collides with other cars, pedestrians, hazard work cones, or cyclists 
designed to be in the program.  The number of centerline crossings will be measur ed by [CONTACT_404909]’s vehicle traverses the centerline crossing over into oncoming traffic.  Lastly, 
“off-road excursions” will be determined by [CONTACT_404910]’s vehicle traversed the 
lateral road edge and travelled off o nto the grass.  
Clinical Evaluation  
Neck Disability Index (NDI), NRS, PROMIS  and clinical data  (motor, sensory, pain)  will be collected 
prior to each trial and will server  as measure of functional clinical outcomes.  Baseline active 
painless neck and torso range  of motion (axial rotation) will be collected for each patient prior to 
each trial  as described previously .  The Dartfish Software has the option of selecting variou s points 
in space that will allow computer generated range of motion to be calculated and exported to excel 
format.  The data will then be transferred to a secure data collection file.  In addition, field of view 
evaluation, narcotic use and level of fatig ue will be collected prior to each trial.   
 
Demographic Information and Questionnaires  
Prior to beginning testing, each patient will complete sections 1 -6 of the Investigator Form:  
 
Investigator  Form (Sections 1 -5) 
1. Demographic Information:  age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight, medical comorbidities,

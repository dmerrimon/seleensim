Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     8 of 55 PARTICIPATING STUDY SITE - Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) PRÉCIS  Study Title: Local Effects of Acupuncture on the Median and Ulnar Nerves in Patients with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS): A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_241367]: The purpose of this study is to measure the local effects of acupuncture on the median and ulnar nerves in patients with median neuropathy at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome), using nerve conduction studies (NCS) and quantitative sensory testing (QST) as outcomes. Our secondary aim is to compare acupuncture’s effect on the functioning of a diseased nerve (median nerve in CTS) to its effect on a healthy nerve (ulnar). Additionally, we aim to compare the local, nerve-specific effect of manual acupuncture to that of low-frequency electroacupuncture and of high-frequency electroacupuncture.   Design and Outcomes: In a mechanistic study of acupuncture, 60 subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) will be randomized to manual acupuncture (MA), low-frequency electroacupuncture (LF-EA) and high-frequency electroacupuncture (HF-EA) groups. Baseline measurements will consist of QST (vibration and cold detection thresholds), as well as NCS of both median and ulnar nerves. Then, each group will undergo acupuncture to the median nerve (Pericardium channel points) and to the ulnar nerve (Heart channel points), one week apart, order counterbalanced, followed by [CONTACT_447]-acupuncture NCS and QST measurements in both nerves (See Figure 1 below).  During the study initial visit (Week 1) baseline QST and NCS measurements will be obtained, followed by [CONTACT_62215] (manual, low- or high-frequency) intervention to the ulnar or to the median nerve (based on treatment randomization) and repeat post-intervention QST and NCS measurements to both median and ulnar nerves.  During the study second and final week (Week 2), baseline QST and NCS measurements will be obtained again, followed by [CONTACT_62215] (MA, LF-EA, HF-EA) intervention to the nerve, which was not treated the first week. Finally, repeat post-acupuncture QST and NCS measurements will be obtained in both median and ulnar nerves (see Figure 1 below). Interventions and Duration : Subjects will be randomized to 3 intervention groups as specified above: Manual, Low-frequency and High-frequency electroacupuncture. Each subject will receive the following interventions:  1. Acupuncture to PC3, [ADDRESS_293075]-acupuncture NCS measurements.

STUDY OBJECTIVES 1.1. Primary Objective Specific Aim 1: Characterize the effects of acupuncture on QST (cold and vibration sensation thresholds) and nerve conduction study parameters in the Median and Ulnar nerves. Hypothesis: Acupuncture will cause decrease in cold and vibration detection thresholds (improve sensation) in the underlying nerve sensory distribution only. Acupuncture will cause NCS changes, characteristic of improved nerve function.  1.2. Secondary Objectives Specific Aim 2: Compare the effects of acupuncture on a diseased nerve (Median) to those of a healthy nerve (Ulnar), using QST (cold and vibration sensation thresholds) and NCS parameters. Hypothesis: There will be greater change in cold and vibration detection thresholds and NCS parameters in the median nerve compared to the ulnar, due to the lower functional baseline of the median nerve.  Specific Aim 3: Compare the effects of manual acupuncture to those of low-frequency and high-frequency electroacupuncture.    Hypothesis: High-frequency electroacupuncture will have greater effect on NCS, QST followed by [CONTACT_6398]-frequency electroacupuncture and manual acupuncture, in accordance to traditional practices. 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1. Acupuncture Background  Acupuncture is an ancient therapeutic modality, traditionally involving needling techniques, based on ancient Chinese theories of acupoints located along energy channels called meridians. More recently acupuncture has emerged as an important integrative medical treatment, both in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241368] (1, 2). In [ADDRESS_293079]-operative and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and that acupuncture is helpful in other conditions, including stroke rehabilitation (3). More recent evidence-based reviews have shown the therapeutic benefits of acupuncture for chronic low-back pain (44, 45), migraine and tension headache (46, 47), chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (48), among other conditions.    In spi[INVESTIGATOR_241369]’s increased acceptance, its mechanism of action remains unknown. There is debate as to whether there is point-specific response in acupuncture or whether it induces a more generalized response, perhaps related to endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_241370]. Early research suggested that the effects of acupuncture are mediated on a systemic level by [CONTACT_241418][INVESTIGATOR_59791] (4, 5, 6). Acupuncture seems to increase cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_241371], enkephalins, and adrenocorticotropic hormone and its effect can be blocked by [CONTACT_241419] (4, 6). The immune effects of acupuncture seem to be mediated 
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     11 of 55 via increased activity of splenic NK cells and levels of interferon-gamma (7). Acupuncture may also affect the gene expression of neuropeptides and their receptors (8, 9). A centrally acting agent/mechanism, however, cannot explain why acupuncture is conventionally applied in close proximity to the locus of pain and why the analgesic effects of acupuncture are often limited to the ipsilateral side (10, 11).   For many decades acupuncture practitioners and anatomists have attempted to correlate the location of acupuncture points to peripheral nerves, spi[INVESTIGATOR_241372] (12-17, 18). This neuroanatomical theory of acupuncture suggests that acupuncture’s effect is mediated via afferent input through the peripheral nervous system, eliciting a reflex at the level of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_241373] (19, 20).  The neurophysiologic testing to support these theories is lacking so far and further study on the local effects of acupuncture on the peripheral nervous system is needed. There is a consensus, however, that the nervous system is vital in processing the effects of acupuncture.  2.2. Significance  The lack of understanding of acupuncture’s mechanism of action is a major obstacle to its wider acceptance. The lack of objective physiologic measurements of acupuncture’s effect has posed many difficulties in designing acupuncture research studies involving dose response and efficacy.  Our research will address this knowledge gap by [CONTACT_241420] (NCS) parameters and Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) in the territory of that nerve. Additionally, we will isolate these effects by [CONTACT_241421] a neighboring nerve. Quantifying acupuncture’s effects using physiologic parameters and discreet values could standardize treatment regimens and measure therapeutic effect in tangible ways. As acupuncture practices vary widely, with various treatment modalities and point selection, the ability to measure direct effects on the peripheral nerves may help compare treatment regimens and standardize practices by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_241374].   This line of research is expected to substantiate the proposed association between acupuncture meridians and peripheral nerves in the arm and leg and translate the explanatory constructs of channels and Qi, drawn from TCM into an acceptable western physiologic paradigm of nerve physiologic changes based on redistribution of charge.  2.3. Innovation While fascia changes have been implicated in chronic pain conditions (50), likely mediated by a local inflammatory response, the analgesic effects of acupuncture cannot be explained by [CONTACT_241422], without involvement of the nervous system. Langevin and Sherman (51) recently hypothesized that acupuncture causes changes in mechano- and nociceptive receptors in connective tissue. Recent histological studies of fascia have shown it to be very rich in Ruffini and Pacinian corpuscles and free nerve endings and it is therefore believed to be involved in proprioception (32). The proposed research is innovative, in our opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], because it does not seek to disprove or adopt the fascia mechanistic theory of acupuncture, but rather focuses on the 
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     12 of 55 peripheral nervous system’s processing of acupuncture as a final common pathway before further mediation and potentiation occur at the level of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_241375].   QST and NCS have both been used in acupuncture research before, however their use has been to assess therapeutic clinical improvements in the patient (21, 42). These measurements have never been targeted to a particular nerve distribution and used to study anatomical correlations between acupoints/channels and an underlying peripheral nerve, with the goal of assessing for acupuncture-induced functional changes in the nerve. We hope that this line of research will lead to a cohesive understanding of acupuncture’s mechanism of action, which incorporates the fascia and the peripheral nervous system effects.   2.4. The “DeQi” Sensation and the Peripheral Nerves According to traditional acupuncture teachings, it is essential to elicit a sensation called “DeQi”, in order to achieve therapeutic results. This sensation is accomplished by [CONTACT_241423]. It has been described as aching, soreness, heaviness/pressure, fullness, warmth, coolness, tingling, numbness and dull pain at the site of the needle (29) or radiating paresthesias (30). It appears that this sensation is mediated by [CONTACT_241424]. In clinical practice patients often report that manipulation of the acupuncture needles causes a sensation “like hitting one’s funny bone” and neuropathy patients, when undergoing acupuncture of local points in the feet, liken the sensation to an exacerbation of their neuropathy symptoms. Langevin et al (31) have suggested that the sensation of DeQi is elicited by [CONTACT_241425], however muscle fiber contraction surrounding the needle remains a possibility. From a neurologic perspective, both muscle or fascia manipulation would result in mechanical compression and possibly release of inflammatory factors, leading to small and larger peripheral nerve fiber activation.   2.5. Introduction to Acupuncture Modalities – Manual and Electroacupuncture Manual acupuncture consists of placing needles in acupuncture points, at a point-specific pre-determined depth, based on established guidelines from the Traditional Chinese Medicine literature. Following insertion the needles are manually manipulated with rapid clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation or small vertical adjustments in the scale of millimeters. This manipulation (aka needle stimulation) is carried out for 45 sec – 1-[ADDRESS_293080] feels the “De Qi’ sensation. The needles are then left in for 15-[ADDRESS_293081]’s style of practice.   Electroacupuncture is an acupuncture modality, which gained wide acceptance in the 1950s simultaneously in China, [LOCATION_013] and Japan (43). It consists of placing acupuncture needles in traditional acupuncture points, then connecting them to an electrostimulating device. Electrical current is applied to connect 2 needles to an anode and cathode. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_241376] 10-80 milliamps is applied, with a voltage range of range of 40-80 volts. Frequency varies from 2-100 Hz. In general lower frequencies (2-10Hz) are considered to be toning/stimulating of the nerves and higher frequencies (80-100 Hz) are considered inhibitory and are used for analgesia (43). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_241377] 10-20 minutes.   
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     13 of 55 2.6. Quantitative Sensation Testing (QST) Computer-assisted Sensory Evaluation (CASE) aka Quantitative Sensation Testing (QST) has been in clinical use since the late 1970s, when Dyck, O’Brien et al introduced the concept of an automated system to evaluate touch-pressure vibration and thermal cutaneous sensation (38). QST is administered in a lab and consists of standardized, precisely delivered computer-generated stimuli, based on careful study of physiologic perception thresholds and “just noticeable difference (JND)” of heat, cold, vibration and touch-pressure (39). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_241378] (VDT) in the hand and the dorsal surface of the hand is used to assess cooling (CDT) or heating detection threshold.   
                          Fig.2. CASE IV Vibration Stimulator        Fig.3. CASE IV Thermal Stimulator  The creators of the CASE system created various algorithms for assessing hyper- and hypoalgesia in peripheral neuropathy patients. QST performed with the fourth generation system (CASEIV) have been shown to be efficient, reproducible, and validated against other algorithms of sensory testing (40). The correlation coefficients for vibratory detection threshold (VDT) and cooling detection threshold (CDT) have been found by [CONTACT_7809] 0.9 (40). While QST has become a widely-used research tool, the validity of its results is highly dependent on the subject’s ability to cooperate and sustain focused attention on stimulus presentation. Therefore, QST cannot be administered when the patient is inattentive, uncooperative, demented, sedated, or too ill to cooperate.  2.7. Study Rationale - Acupuncture for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, PC6 and the Median Nerve One area of acupuncture research, which has yielded successful results, is the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). Acupuncture has shown to be effective for mild-moderate CTS with lasting effects on Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) a year post-treatment (21). Additionally, laser acupuncture and TENS applied to the wrist has been shown to be effective in the treatment of CTS, with symptom improvement still present on 1-3 year follow-up (22, 23). Interestingly the above treatment protocols all involved acupuncture regimens with needles placed in the Pericardium channel (PC), most commonly PC6 (21, 24) and PC7 (21, 22, 23, 25) and PC3 (25), see Figure 4 below.   Fig.4. Anatomical Correlation of the Pericardium Meridian/Channel and the median nerve 

  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     14 of 55   The anatomical connection of the acupuncture point PC6 and the Median nerve has been well established both in cadavers (26) and in live subjects using ultrasound (27, 28), most strikingly with a documented case of the acupuncture needle pi[INVESTIGATOR_241379], with absence of any symptoms in the subject (28).   All these studies raise the question of the effect of acupuncture in the Pericardium channel on the underlying Median Nerve.   2.8. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_241380], tolerable and capable of producing the projected outcome variables in an accurate and consistent manner. We have achieved lab consistency in QST and NCS outcome measures. We have completed testing of 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_241381]:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 1: 65 yo woman with moderate CTS. Treated with HF-EA to Median nerve (Week 1), followed by [CONTACT_241426]-EA to Ulnar nerve (Week 2). Cold detection threshold in the Median nerve territory improved with acupuncture from 13.1 to 8.7 units. Ulnar territory cold detection was unchanged with acupuncture. Median nerve compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) amplitude at the wrist and elbow increased with acupuncture by a third, whereas Ulnar CMAP were unchanged with acupuncture. She reported symptomatic improvement at Week 2.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 2: 69 yo man with moderate CTS. Treated with HF-EA to Median nerve (Week 1), followed by [CONTACT_241426]-EA to Ulnar nerve (Week 2). No significant changes were seen in QST with acupuncture, however the subject had new Sensory Nerve Action Potentials (SNAP) in the Median nerve during Week 2, which were absent in Week 1 prior to acupuncture intervention. He also had symptomatic improvement at Week 2.   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 3: 43 yo woman with moderate CTS. Treated with HF-EA to Median nerve (Week 1), followed by [CONTACT_241426]-EA to Ulnar nerve (Week 2). Both cold and vibration detection threshold in the Median nerve territory improved with acupuncture (12.5 to 8.4 and 8.7 to 3.9, respectively). 

  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     15 of 55 Median motor nerve conduction velocity increased from 54.5 to 59.3 m/s with acupuncture. Median sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) increased from 42.3 to 50.2 m/s in Week 1 during treatment. Ulnar sensory NCV did not change in Week 1, but increased from 66.7 to 78.6 m/s in Week [ADDRESS_293082] was completely symptom free and remained so 2 months after the conclusion of the study (she called the lab). 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_241382], by [CONTACT_241427], which appear to track the path of the median and the ulnar nerves, respectively (see Figure 5 below). All subjects will have a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, which is a median nerve entrapment at the wrist.   Subjects will be randomly allocated to one of 3 intervention groups – manual acupuncture (MA), low-frequency electroacupuncture (LF-EA) and high-frequency electroacupuncture (HF-EA). All subjects will have a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (median nerve entrapment at the wrist). The intervention will be acupuncture (MA, LF-EA or HF-EA) and the outcome variables – post-acupuncture NCS of the median and ulnar nerves and quantitative sensory testing (QST) measurements in the palmar median and ulnar nerve distributions (specifically cold and vibration detection thresholds), see Figure 1 above. In each group there will be 2 treatments in random order, in which acupuncture will be applied to the median nerve/Pericardium meridian and the ulnar nerve/Heart Meridian.  Fig.5. Anatomic correlation of the median nerve and Pericardium Channel (PC) and of the ulnar nerve and Heart Channel (HT).   
   The healthy ulnar nerve will serve as a control in two ways:  1. Local Effects - the ulnar nerve, being in close proximity to the median nerve, will be investigated for possible effects when acupuncture is delivered to Pericardium channel points (over the median nerve). In this way we will explore whether acupuncture has effects only on the underlying nerve, or also on a neighboring nerve. This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_241428]-acupuncture QST and NCS in both the median and ulnar nerves, when the intervention is done over the median nerve.  

  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     16 of 55 Hypothesis: Acupuncture will cause decrease in cold and vibration detection thresholds (improve sensation) in the underlying nerve sensory distribution only. Acupuncture will cause NCS changes, characteristic of improved nerve function.  2. Healthy vs Diseased nerve Effect – The intervention will be delivered over the ulnar nerve (healthy) as well, using Heart channel acupuncture points. This will enable us to compare the acupuncture effect on a healthy nerve, compared to a diseased nerve (Median nerve in patients with CTS).  Hypothesis: There will be greater change in cold and vibration detection thresholds and NCS parameters in the median nerve compared to the ulnar, due to the lower functional baseline of the median nerve.  Our third goal involves comparison among the 3 intervention groups , specifically we aim to compere the effects of manual acupuncture (MA) to those of low-frequency (LF_EA) and high-frequency electroacupuncture (HF-EA).    Hypothesis: High-frequency electroacupuncture will have greater effect on NCS, QST followed by [CONTACT_6398]-frequency electroacupuncture and manual acupuncture, in accordance to traditional practices.  3.1. Study subjects 60 subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome will be randomized to 3 intervention groups as described above with stratification for age and gender. Subjects will be both male and female, ages 18-75. Subjects will be recruited from OHSU’s EMG lab and neuromuscular clinic.   3.2. Study site OHSU will be the only study site for this protocol  3.3. Experimental duration and follow-up Study procedures will be carried out over 2 consecutive weeks (see Figure 1). As this is a mechanistic study involving immediate effects of acupuncture on a peripheral nerve, there will be no follow up period beyond Week 2. This study employs 3 commonly practiced, well established interventions, which are considered low-risk: nerve conduction studies (NCS), quantitative sensory testing (QST) and acupuncture to the forearm. Subjects will be given all necessary follow-up contact [CONTACT_241429], as described in Section 7 (Safety Assessments).   3.4. Blinding  As this is a mechanistic study comparing acupuncture to acupuncture intervention, it is impossible to blind subjects in the conventional sense. Depending on a subject’s knowledge of anatomy and acupuncture, however, a subject may or may not be aware as to which nerve is targeted for intervention on each week.   All QST assessments will be performed in blinded fashion and the investigators assessing the outcome measures will not be delivering the intervention (acupuncture). QST assessments will be performed by a blinded investigator (Tabatha Memmott), who will be seated behind a screen with the subject’s arm, needles and QST probes not visible. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_241383]. Additionally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_241384], which will be delivered by a licensed acupuncturist (Annette Fallian or Yunpeng Luo).

Study Enrollment Procedures  Potential participants will be identified through screening OHSU’s EMG lab and neuromuscular clinic patient schedules. Basic eligibility screening will be conducted using OHSU’s electronic medical record database (EPIC). Patients, who pass this medical record screening will be approached by [CONTACT_978]. If a patient is interested, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_241389], risks and benefits of the study. At this point if a patient agrees to screening, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_241390], habits and recent (within last 2 years) EMG/NCS. The screening results will be documented using the Subject Screening Form (Appendix A). If a potential subject is determined to be eligible, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_241391]/her questions, inform the subject that he/she may withdraw consent at any point and obtain informed consent for the study. This will involve presenting the subject with a Lay Language Protocol Summary and an OHSU Consent-and-Authorization form (as required by [CONTACT_127869]) is also included in Appendix A.   Following enrollment, subjects will come to the lab for initial screening, consisting of QST and NCS. Following this testing, if they pass the Secondary Exclusion Criteria, subjects will be randomized to MA, LF-EA and HF-EA, using a computer-generated stratified randomization based on age and gender.   4.4. Stratified Randomization Subjects will be randomized to the 3 intervention groups, using a specially-designed computer program which will enable stratified randomization based on 2x2 categories where one category is gender (M/F) and the other is projected median age split of 56, based on age of enrolled pi[INVESTIGATOR_241392] (18-56/57-75).   Gender and age have confounding effect on proper estimation of NCS and QST as they vary by [CONTACT_123744]. Specifically, men tend to have faster nerve conduction velocities (NCV) and larger nerves than women and with age NCV declines and sensory thresholds, measured by [CONTACT_241431] (38, 49, 55, 56). Randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_241432], and all outcome assessors will be blinded to it.   The randomization program is also designed to offer random order of acupuncture intervention location (median vs ulnar nerves), with a built-in ability to assign 50% of subjects within a group to median nerve first and the other 50% - to ulnar nerve first.   4.5. Accrual Plan  Subjects will be recruited from OHSU’s EMG lab as the lab follows rigorous electrodiagnostic criteria for CTS diagnosis. Such criteria are usually lab-specific and take years to develop. Additionally, a recent EMG is crucial as CTS tends to fluctuate and has a relapsing-remitting course for most patients. We plan to recruit subjects in the EMG lab, immediately after completion of their NCS/EMG. The EMG lab at OHSU sees anywhere from 12-20 CTS subjects per month. Our experience with recruiting pi[INVESTIGATOR_241393] 2 sessions may improve CTS symptoms and often times the alternative is more invasive such as carpal tunnel release surgery.  
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     20 of 55  Of the 12-20 CTS patients seen in the lab many would not meet the eligibility criteria or would not be able to participate for reasons listed above – travel, logistics, surgery, etc. We have had great success recruiting patients local to the Portland area with mild-moderate CTS so far.  Once the protocol is approved we anticipate enrollment of 2-4 subjects per month. This number varies due to seasonal patient volume and staffing fluctuations in the EMG lab. Other factors in recruitment are: EMG lab patients who are not local to Portland and unwilling to travel for study purposes, patients who are scheduled for carpal tunnel release surgery and who wish to proceed with surgery without delay for study participation, patients who have severe carpal tunnel syndrome, rising prevalence of marijuana use (including medical marijuana), anatomic variants or other conditions making patients ineligible for the study and lastly patients who simply are not interested in participation.   An overly conservative estimation of [ADDRESS_293085] 4-5 subjects per month and will plan to do so, if we are able to recruit this number.   5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS (See Figure 1 – Study Procedures Flowchart)  5.1. Week [ADDRESS_293086] Measurement Patients will be tested for vibratory detection threshold (VDT) and cold detection (CDT) using the CASEIV system, described above.   VDT Vibration Stimuli will be delivered as 25 discrete levels ranging from 0.0 to 350 micrometers (μm) of displacement, based on previously established “Just Noticeable Difference” (JND) values (38). Each stimulus is presented with an exponential onset, and turns off with an exponential decay, in order to eliminate the touch-pressure artifact, which is caused by [CONTACT_241433]/off. Stimulation will be delivered to the 2nd digit finger pad  (median distribution) and the 5th digit finger pad (ulnar distribution), with the hand stretched out supi[INVESTIGATOR_821] (palm facing up) on an even surface.   CDT The Thermal Stimulator use a four‑degree‑per‑second ramp up and down, and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_241394] a range from 8 degrees to 50 degrees C., with an accuracy of 1.25 to 0.25 degrees C., depending on temperature. For high-magnitude thermal (cooling) stimuli, the absolute temperature is limited to 8 degrees C. Thermal stimuli are approximately 6 seconds in duration. CDT will be assessed over the thenar eminence (median distribution) and hypothenar eminence (ulnar distribution) with the hand on an even surface, supi[INVESTIGATOR_241395].   The 4, 2 and 1 stimulus presentation algorithm (to be used both for VDT and CDT) 
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     21 of 55 The 4, 2, 1 stimulus presentation algorithm was developed by [CONTACT_241434] (41) as a more time-efficient alternative to forced choice, as it enables investigators to assess the sensory threshold in a given sensory modality in 2-[ADDRESS_293087] cases.  Testing will begin at an intermediate level (level 13 of 25). The stimulus will be increased (if not felt) or decreased (if felt) by [CONTACT_241435] (felt at the higher level when not felt at lower levels, or not felt at the lower level when it had been felt at the higher level). After the first turnaround, steppi[INVESTIGATOR_241396]. After the second turnaround, steppi[INVESTIGATOR_241397]. A total of [ADDRESS_293088] will be classified as insensitive (QST hypoalgesia). If three consecutive successes were observed at level 1, testing will be terminated and the subject was classified as supersensitive (QST Hyperalgesia). Five null stimuli will be randomly interspersed among 15 non-null stimuli. A positive response (indicating perception) to more than one null stimulus will abort the program. The subject will be re-instructed, and the test will be re-run. Three failures (due to spurious answers to null stimuli) when the test is re-run twice after the test is initially aborted will indicate that the algorithm could not be used for this subject and the subject will be excluded from further participation in the study.  Following baseline QST subjects who can comply with and tolerate QST, have no hypo-or hyperalgesia will undergo baseline NCS studies.   5.1.2. Baseline Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) Following informed consent (obtained during subject screening), baseline nerve conduction studies will be performed according to OHSU’s EMG laboratory procedures and in accordance with well established guidelines, as described by [CONTACT_241436] (49). These nerve conduction studies are standard clinical procedures in evaluating patients with neuromuscular diseases and will be performed using the Dantec Keypoint® G4 Workstation (Natus Medical Incorporated). Subject skin temperature will be maintained above 32 C, using a heating pad to warm up a cold hand if needed.   Specifically, the following nerve conduction studies will be performed: a. Median Nerve Conduction Study:  We will measure the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude from the second digit, the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes from the Abductor Pollicis Brevis, the motor and sensory distal latency, and the nerve conduction velocity in the forearm (from the elbow to the wrist). b. Ulnar Nerve Conduction Study:  We will measure the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude from the fifth digit, the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes from the Abductor Digiti Minimi, the motor and sensory distal latency, and the nerve conduction velocity in the forearm (from below elbow to the wrist)  Following baseline NCS, subjects who pass the Secondary Exclusion criteria (have mild-moderate CTS by [CONTACT_241437], are able to tolerate NCS, lack pure motor neuropathy or ulnar neuropathy), will be randomized as described above.  
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version [ADDRESS_293089] and NCS testing will exit the study without being randomized and will be compensated for their time, as stated in the OHSU Consent-and-Authorization form (Appendix A).   5.1.3. Acupuncture Delivery (See Figure 1) Studies will be randomized to 3 acupuncture modalities (MA, LF-EA and HF-EA). Within each group, a subject will receive 2 acupuncture sessions – one in Week 1, the other in Week 2, in random order either to the median or to the ulnar nerve. This separation into [ADDRESS_293090] (Annette Fallian or Yunpeng Luo), using sterile single-use acupuncture needles (DBC Spring Ten 0.25x30 mm, 0.25x40 mm, DongBang Corp, Korea). In all [ADDRESS_293091] through the session by [CONTACT_30545]/manipulation of the needles.   In the electroacupuncture groups (LF-EA and HF-EA) such manipulation will not be possible, however electrical stimulus intensity will be adjusted so that the subjects continues to feel the electricity-caused paresthesias/DeQi throughout the treatment period. In both electroacupuncture modalities pulse duration will be 60 microseconds, on a continuous frequency. Electroacupuncture will be was performed by [CONTACT_241438] (Electrostimulator 6c.Pro, Pantheon Research, Venice, CA – See Figs 6, 7) with insulated cable clamps connected to the acupuncture needles.  For LF-EA, a frequency of 2 Hz will be used and for HF-EA- frequency of 100 Hz. Stimulus intensity will be increased and re-adjusted, so that the patient feels the stimulation strongly, but not painfully (2–8 mA). This will be done as each 5 minutes the patients will be asked to rate the intensity of the electrical sensation on a scale from 1-10, with desired range 6-7/10. Adjustments to stimulus intensity will be done so that it is perceived at 6-7/[ADDRESS_293092] 20 minutes.  Fig.6. Electroacupuncture delivery using Pantheon 6c Electrostimulator

     Fig.8. Acupuncture point PC3 (Pericardium 3)  Fig.9. Acupuncture point PC5 (Pericardium 5)   For the ulnar nerve acupuncture treatment (MA, LF-EA or HF-EA) the insertion points will be on the Heart Channel (HT3 and HT4), which are used to stimulate the channel (water-metal points) according to traditional 5-element acupuncture theory (see images below). HT3 and HT4 are closely anatomically associated with the ulnar nerve (Figure 5).   Fig.10. Acupuncture point HT3 (Heart 3)               Fig 11. Acupuncture point HT4 (Heart 4) 
     5.2. Experimental Procedure Timeline (Figure 1) During Week 1, enrolled and consented subjects will come to the lab for Week [ADDRESS_293093] equipment and will undergo assessment of baseline cold detection threshold (CDT) and vibration detection threshold (VDT), as well as baseline NCS as outlined above. This would take approximately 1.[ADDRESS_293094] (Figure 1). Subjects who do not pass the Secondary Exclusion Criteria will exit the study, with proper documentation of why they were ineligible.   Those who pass the Secondary Exclusion Criteria will be randomized to MA, LF-EA and HF-EA, as well as undergo random treatment assignment of median (PC3, PC5) or ulnar (HT3, HT4) nerve. Following randomization a subject will undergo acupuncture for [ADDRESS_293095] (CDT and VDT) and NCS will be obtained in a manner analogous to the Week [ADDRESS_293096], with the needles retained in position, followed by [CONTACT_241439]. This will conclude Week 1. Total estimated time of Week 1 procedures is 4-4.5 hours. Subjects will be provided with water, bathroom break/other breaks as needed and a healthy snack.   Week [ADDRESS_293097] and NCS outlined above, although subjects will not be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria at Week 2. A second baseline is necessary because in our experience even a single intervention to PC3, PC5 or HT3, HT4 may alter NCS and QST parameters or the median and ulnar nerves, respectively.   Once Week [ADDRESS_293098] and NCS (Figure 1).   After the acupuncture intervention, Week [ADDRESS_293099] (CDT, VDT) and NCS will be obtained in a manner analogous to those obtained in Week 1. Following completion of Week 2 NCS, subjects will complete and exit the study. Total testing time for Week 2 is estimated to be 3.5-4 hours.   Data will be recorded using the study Data Form (Appendix A).  5.3. Adherence Assessment  We do not anticipate problems with adherence as acupuncture will be delivered in the lab during both study visits. It is possible that some subjects will exit the study after Week 1, in which case we will include their results from Week 1 in the analysis.

STUDY PROCEDURE/EVALUATION SCHEDULE Procedure SCREENING  (in EMG Lab or Neuromuscular Clinic) WEEK [ADDRESS_293100] Screening x   EMG/NCS review of prior study (up to 2 yrs old) x   Prospective Subject Interview x   Study Screening by [CONTACT_976] x   Screening Form x   Enrollment and OHSU Consent-and-Authorization Form x   Lay Language Protocol Summary form x   Baseline QST and NCS  x x Screening for Secondary Exclusion Criteria by [CONTACT_976]  x  Randomization and Random Treatment Assignment  x  Data Form  x x Acupuncture Intervention  x x Post-acupuncture QST and NCS  x x Study Completion and Exit   x Adverse Events   X X 7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  Acupuncture holds the risk of minor bleeding/ecchymoses, especially in coagulopathic patients or those taking anti-platelet agents. Placing needles in the area of the median or ulnar nerves may lead to nerve damage by [CONTACT_241440], however the acupuncture points described above (PC3,5 and HT3,4) are commonly used and well established as safe over centuries of acupuncture practice. Furthermore, the needle used in acupuncture is 30G and solid (non-hollow), which minimizes underlying tissue damage. Electroacupuncture causes small, rapid muscle contractions surrounding the needles, which can feel unpleasant, but is not painful or harmful. In clinical practice patients routinely undergo acupuncture without any need for follow-up, unless a problem arises.    NCS testing is unpleasant to most patients, however holds no health risk. QST is widely considered safe and non-invasive.  
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     27 of 55 7.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Assessment of acupuncture’s safety is typi[INVESTIGATOR_241398]. Adverse events typi[INVESTIGATOR_241399] a result of treatment or in the few days immediately post-treatment. There are no lab values or other parameters, which could assure acupuncture safety.  An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Adverse events will be recorded regardless of their relationship to the study intervention.    Examples of unanticipated adverse events involving acupuncture are: infection at the acupuncture needling site, moderate-severe bruising and bleeding at the acupuncture site, moderate-severe pain and discomfort after acupuncture, new onset of weakness or numbness, permanent worsening of carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms.   A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241400]/incapacity.   7.2. Subject Follow up and Protection against Risk  All subjects will be given [CONTACT_241473]’s contact [CONTACT_241441] 8-day study period and following completion of the study. In the unlikely event that acupuncture causes lasting discomfort, bothersome ecchymoses, worsening of carpal tunnel and neuropathy symptoms, [CONTACT_241473] will be available for urgent assessment and treatment. If the patient needs further neurologic or other care, they will be referred to [CONTACT_241473]’s clinic or to one of the other providers in the neuromuscular division or another appropriate clinician within OHSU. The informed consent will clearly state that a subject may discontinue participation in the study at any time.   As with all human subject investigations at OHSU, any adverse events will be reported to the IRB and there is a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan in place (see details below).  7.3. Adverse Event Tracking and Reporting - Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  There is a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) in place for the IRB-approved study “Local effects of acupuncture on the Median and Ulnar nerves in patients with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome”, in accordance with OHSU IRB’s recommendations and guidelines.   According to this IRB-approved DSMP, an independent study safety monitor has been appointed – [CONTACT_241474]. The independent monitor is a neuromuscular expert and has no conflict of interest and no direct involvement in the study. The research staff will report any unanticipated problems and adverse events to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_241401]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_241402].   The independent monitor will receive a monthly safety report prepared by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dimitrova. The report will include information on any adverse events, unanticipated problems and protocol 
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version [ADDRESS_293101] occurred each month. Reportable unanticipated adverse events include: infection at the acupuncture needling site, moderate-severe bruising and bleeding at the acupuncture site, moderate-severe pain and discomfort after acupuncture, new onset of weakness or numbness, permanent worsening of carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms and any other adverse events. Additionally, serious adverse events such as death, life-threatening adverse events, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], persistent or significant disability/incapacity will be immediately reported to [CONTACT_241475] and to the IRB. Unanticipated adverse events, as well as inability to tolerate experimental procedures will result in immediate exit from the study.       Unanticipated problems will be reported in accordance with the OHSU procedures and timeframes - within [ADDRESS_293102] exit the study, his/her data will be included in the analysis.  9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  9.1. Sample Size Calculation A mechanistic study of acupuncture, which examines its local, nerve-specific effects using Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) as outcome measures has not been attempted before. Therefore, we estimated acupuncture’s effects based on larger studies drawn from the literature. Changes in acupuncture-associated sensation were derived from Lang et al (42) - an evaluation of manual and electroacupuncture- induced analgesia in the legs, using [ADDRESS_293103] sizes in Median nerve conduction velocity (NCV) were calculated as clinically relevant changes from the mean NCV reported by [CONTACT_241442]. al (52) and Di Guglielmo et. al (53). Both studies were NCS characterizations specifically in CTS with 105 and 198 patients respectively and publicized in the AAEM summary statement on electrodiagnostic parameters in CTS (54).  QST testing from the Lang et al (42) acupuncture intervention was observed to be a significant predictor of Cold Detection Threshold (CDT), with a 0.2°C change (-3.6 ± 0.9 °C to -3.4 ± 0.4 °C) seen in the low-frequency-acupuncture treated legs. As this study was conducted in healthy subjects, we expect to see a greater effect of acupuncture on patients with neuropathy, especially as the acupuncture will be administered locally, with greater potential to affect the underlying nerve. Sample size estimation assumed the variance of the change in QST outcomes due to local acupuncture delivery over the Median and Ulnar nerves will be comparable to the variance in QST observed by [CONTACT_241443] (σ2CDT = 0.696 (°C)2).  Under these assumptions, a minimum QST change of 0.35°C, considered reasonable as an on-treatment effect 
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     29 of 55 size in CDT, would be observed as statistically significant at a significance level of α=0.05 with 80% power with 20 subjects per arm.   The pooled parameters of the studies by [CONTACT_241444] (52) and Di Guglielmo et al (53) observed a mean Median nerve motor NCV of 47.5 ± 5.76 m/s in their combined cohort of 303 CTS patients. At minimum and assuming the same variance as seen historically (σ2NCV = 33.2 (m/s)2), an 8% change in NCS (corresponding to a clinically feasible 3.7 m/s change post-intervention) would be considered significant with the same arm size of 20 subjects and at the same significance of α=0.05 and 80% power.  Although estimated from the literature, these on-treatment effect sizes are considered reasonable based on previously collected pi[INVESTIGATOR_241403].  When treatment and testing location were matched, a 0.337°C increase in CDT was observed in the Median nerve compared to the Ulnar nerve. Similarly, a Median nerve motor NCV improvement of 3.3 m/s was observed in the wrist. These initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_241404]-treatment effect size estimates from the literature.    Specific Aim 1: We expect that the proposed sample size of [ADDRESS_293104] (CDT, VDT) of the diseased Median nerve within each of the 3 intervention systems (MA, LF-EA, HF-EA).   Specific Aim 2: For the current study, the Ulnar nerve is serving as a healthy control to allow for comparison to the diseased Median nerve post-intervention.  Historic studies measuring the local, direct effect of acupuncture on a healthy nerve or studies comparing the local effects of acupuncture on a healthy versus a diseased nerve are not available. With respect to our Specific Aim [ADDRESS_293105] in the Ulnar nerve, the proposed sample size from Specific Aim 1 (20 subjects per acupuncture modality) is expected to be sufficient for these comparisons within each type of acupuncture. Further, we plan to carry out the Median/Ulnar nerve comparisons separately for each of the [ADDRESS_293106] serial correlation expected with repeated measurements.    Specific Aim 3: With regards to the proper sample size for comparison among the 3 types of acupuncture – we based the sample size calculation for each study arm in part on the effect sizes observed by [CONTACT_241445] (42), who enrolled [ADDRESS_293107] (CDT) between the 3 acupuncture modalities, p=0.0034. In our current study, the cross-over design is based on the comparisons of Median and Ulnar nerves; however, the individual methods of acupuncture will be populated by [CONTACT_241446].  For this reason, the random-effects blocking of our mixed- models will have the nerve dependence 
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version [ADDRESS_293108] and not require a serial correlation correction. With a significant difference observed by [CONTACT_241447] n=6, the proposed sample size of 20 per intervention group should be more than sufficient to observe differences among the modalities, even without the explicit cross-over design. Please see statistical analysis plan for further details.   As the goal is to recruit 20 subjects per arm, for a total of 60 study completers, we anticipate the need to screen and enroll approximately 75 subjects, including with baseline nerve conduction studies to confirm the diagnosis of mild-moderate CTS and assure that the electrodiagnostic inclusion criteria for this study are met.  9.2. Stratified Randomization – See section 4.4 9.3. Outcome Measures and Statistical Hypotheses, as outlined in the Specific Aims  Specific Aim 1: Characterize the effects of acupuncture on QST (cold and vibration sensation thresholds) and nerve conduction parameters in the Median and Ulnar nerves.  Hypothesis: Acupuncture will cause decrease in cold and vibration detection thresholds (improve sensation) in the underlying nerve sensory distribution only. Acupuncture will cause NCS changes, characteristic of improved nerve function. The outcomes generated in this aim will be the baseline and post-acupuncture values of CDT and VDT from Week [ADDRESS_293109]-acupuncture nerve conduction study data from both weeks, consisting of: distal motor/sensory latencies, CMAP and SNAP amplitudes, CMAP area and duration, nerve conduction velocities.   Specific Aim 2: Compare the effects of acupuncture on a diseased nerve (Median) to those of a healthy nerve (Ulnar), using QST (cold and vibration sensation thresholds) and NCS parameters.  Hypothesis: There will be greater change in cold and vibration detection thresholds and NCS parameters in the median nerve compared to the ulnar, due to the lower functional baseline of the median nerve. The outcomes generated in this aim consist of statistical comparison of acupuncture-induced CDT, VDT and NCS changes in the Median nerve to those in the Ulnar nerve. The Post- minus Pre- acupuncture differences will be compared for the Median and Ulnar nerves in pooled data from all 3 groups, using independent sample t-testing.   Specific Aim 3: Compare the effects of manual acupuncture to those of low-frequency and high-frequency electroacupuncture.  Hypothesis: High-frequency electroacupuncture will have greater effect on NCS, QST followed by [CONTACT_6398]-frequency electroacupuncture and manual acupuncture, in accordance to traditional practices. Acupuncture-induced changes in CDT, DVT and NCS parameters will be compared among the 3 groups (Post- minus Pre- changes), using ANOVA.  9.4. Statistical Analysis Plan  Primary statistical analysis for all [ADDRESS_293110] models to evaluate the effects of treatment group and intervened nerve location on the outcome measures described above. A mixed-model design will be used to create an intention-to-treat framework 
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     31 of 55 and allow for any missing data. Principal assessment will be on the change in outcomes resulting from acupuncture intervention, calculated as the difference in outcomes before and after treatment. These outcomes will include CDT and VDT, distal motor/sensory latencies, CMAP and SNAP amplitudes, CMAP area and duration, nerve conduction velocities (Specific Aim1). Acupuncture characterization will be carried out first in the Median and Ulnar nerves of the arm (Specific Aims 1, 2). In both Median and Ulnar nerve interventions, group will be a three level factor based on the type of acupuncture - MA, LF-EA and HF-EA (Specific Aim 3).  Specific Aims 1 and 2: As a principal independent variable, location of the intervention will be a four-level factor encompassing the possible combinations of treated and evaluated nerves. For Specific Aims 1 and 2, these levels will be: MM – Median treated and tested, MU – Median treated and Ulnar tested, UM – Ulnar treated and Median tested, and UU – Ulnar treated and tested. A time variable (Week 1, Week 2) will also be included to test for any effects due to order of the treated nerves. Additional covariates known to be associated with QST and NCS outcomes such as age and gender will be corrected for as well. Secondary analysis will include treatment evaluations of outcomes within each location of intervention and additional contrasts between the four time points (pre and post treatment for both Week 1 and Week 2). Persistence of the acupuncture effects will specifically be assessed by [CONTACT_241448].   Another way to characterize the wash-out effect of acupuncture is to compare baseline data from Week [ADDRESS_293111] both to the nerve location (healthy Ulnar vs diseased Median), time (Week 1 vs Week 2) as well as the order of nerve assessment (the interaction).  However, with the repeated nerve measures, it will still be necessary to utilize a mixed-model approach so that the random-effects blocking (nerve location dependent on subject) will allow for the intra-subject serial correlation. For the final model, although exploration of the wash-out effect will be critical, it will pose to be impractical to keep all these covariates in the final model. Only significant time-dependent interactions will be included since the model would otherwise suffer from overfitting due to too many covariates and the limited sample size.   Specific Aim 2: Following completion of Specific Aim 1, we expect to see significant acupuncture effect on the Median nerve (within each acupuncture group). In our proposed mixed linear model for Specific Aims 1 and 2 this would represent MM on the level of each individual group (MA, LF-EA, HF-EA). Conversely, we do not expect to observe a significant effect of acupuncture on the healthy Ulnar nerve as it is already functioning at optimal physiologic level. This would be the UU at the level of each individual group and corresponds to a clinical control. We will conduct direct contrasts between MM and UU as part of the mixed linear model with nerve location, time dependencies and random-effects groupi[INVESTIGATOR_241405] 1.   
  
Local Effects of Acupuncture in CTS, version 1     32 of 55 Specific Aim 3: We will revise the linear mixed model and focus on the MM factor from Specific Aims 1 and 2 (Median nerve treated and tested). In this revised model we will incorporate acupuncture modality as a 3-factor covariate (MA, LF-EA, HF-EA). Incorporating both the 4-factor sets of nerve intervention/assessment combinations and the 3-factor acupuncture modality would create a very complex model with over 15 variables. As described in the washout analysis, this will lead to overfitting of the model and cause it to be underpowered at 60 subjects. We could run a similar revised mixed liner model analysis substituting UU, UM or MU for MM, although this would be beyond the scope of Specific Aim 3.    Because of the exploratory nature of our analyses, no adjustment for multiple testing will be undertaken. Raw P values 0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant. Regardless, the multiple assessments inherent in the exploratory analysis will be discussed in future publications. Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  9.5. Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_241406].

The purpose of this study is to measure the effects of acupuncture on [ADDRESS_293128] for diagnosing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.  No EMG (needle muscle testing) will be used in this research protocol.   As another measurement of nerve function, we will use Quantitative Sensory Testing – a precise and non-invasive neurologic assessment of a subject’s ability to sense vibration and cold temperature in the hand.   Week 1: The first week’s protocol will begin with Nerve Conduction Study and Quantitative Sensory Testing.   Nerve Conduction Studies are the non-invasive part (with small electric stimulation, but no needles) of a larger test called EMG (electromyography). They consist of delivering small electrical stimuli over peripheral nerves and measuring the speed and magnitude of nerve conduction, so the health of the large peripheral nerves can be examined. Nerve Conduction Studies will be performed on the arm diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.   Quantitative Sensory Testing is a non-invasive precise measurement of a person’s ability to perceive cold and vibration, tested over a small patch of skin on the hand.  Those subjects whose Nerve Conduction Studies and Quantitative Sensory Testing meet the study’s criteria will proceed to acupuncture followed by [CONTACT_241458].

  IRB#: __________ Protocol Approval Date: _____________   MED. REC. NO. _____ NAME _____ BIRTHDATE _____    Clinical Research Consent Summary  Local Effects of Acupuncture on the Median and Ulnar Nerves in Patients with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome   You are being asked to join a research study because you have been diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome – a condition affecting the median Nerve in the wrist and causing symptoms such as painful burning, tingling, numbness and sometimes weakness in the hand. You do not have to join the study.  Even if you decide to join now, you can change your mind later.  If you decide to join, you will be asked to sign a consent form, which shows you give permission to be in the study, and an authorization form, which shows you give permission for us to use your health information for the study.  1. The purpose of this study is to learn more about acupuncture and its direct effects on the peripheral nerves.  2. In this study, we will learn how acupuncture needles affect 2 peripheral nerves in the arm – the median Nerve and the ulnar Nerve. We want to learn:  a. Whether acupuncture needles placed in traditionally used acupuncture points have any direct effect on the nearly nerves.   b. We will test the nerve’s function by [CONTACT_241460]. Both of these are non-invasive tests and are generally considered safe.   c. Acupuncture consists of the insertion of thin, sterile, single-use disposable needles in the body. Various sensations are experienced during treatment including a distended feeling around the needle site, itching, tingling, a dull ache, burning or heaviness. There is minor discomfort during needle insertion and manipulation. During electroacupuncture 2 acupuncture needles are connected to an electrostimulation machine and thus deliver a very small level electrical current to the tissues. The sensation of electroacupuncture are similar to the ones described above, but may also include painless muscle twitching.

The purpose of this study is to learn more about the way acupuncture works. Our goal is to apply acupuncture in traditionally used points in the forearm close to the Median Nerve and Ulnar Nerve and measure the effect of acupuncture on those nerves, using Nerve Conduction Studies, which are identical to the test you underwent when you were diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (consisting of small electrical shocks to the arm). No EMG (needle muscle testing) will be used in this research protocol.   As another measurement of nerve function, we will use Quantitative Sensory Testing – a precise neurologic assessment of your ability to sense vibration and cold temperature in the hand.   This study attempts to measure the effects of acupuncture on 2 of the large peripheral nerves in the forearm. It will yield data, which may improve our understanding on how acupuncture works.   While acupuncture has been shown to help certain patients with neuropathy, including Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, our experimental protocol is somewhat different from typi[INVESTIGATOR_241414]. It is possible that some of the study participants may feel improvement in their Carpal Tunnel Syndrome symptoms; specifically acupuncture may improve the speed and amplitude of nerve conduction and sensation in the hand. This would be an unintended benefit of the study and is by [CONTACT_241462]. We do not know whether acupuncture applied to the forearm would affect the nerves favorably.  

 
 Revised 6/28/2012 – Corrected 7/10/2012  Page 2 of 5 MED. REC. NO.:______________________  NAME:______________________  Epic CSN (if applicable):______________________   This study requires 2 visits to OHSU, 1 week apart. We plan to enroll a total of 60 subjects, who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.     PROCEDURES:     Week 1: The first week’s protocol will begin with Nerve Conduction Study and Quantitative Sensory Testing. You have undergone Nerve Conduction Studies as part of your diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Our procedure will be somewhat shorter. Nerve Conduction Studies are the non-invasive part (with small electric stimulation, but no needles) of the test you underwent when you were diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Quantitative Sensory Testing is a non-invasive precise measurement of your ability to perceive cold and vibration, tested over a small patch of skin on the hand.  If the results of these tests meet the study inclusion criteria, you will proceed to acupuncture followed by [CONTACT_241458]. You may be given manual acupuncture, low frequency or high frequency electroacupuncture, depending on the randomization process.   The first visit should last 1:30-2:30 hours, depending on your ability to focus and sustain attention during the quantitative sensory testing.   Week 2: During the second week acupuncture (the same type as Week 1) will be applied to a different location in the forearm, again followed by [CONTACT_241463].   This session will last 1-2 hours. At the end of the second visit the study will be complete and you will be compensated for your time and effort.  This is a randomized study. Neither you nor the investigator can choose which modality of acupuncture group you will be assigned to – manual acupuncture, low frequency or high-frequency electroacupuncture.  Your medical record will be reviewed in order to obtain information needed for the study. Specifically, your nerve conduction studies/EMG and current medications will be reviewed, as well as a list of current and past medical conditions.

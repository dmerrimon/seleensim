Page 7 of 95 BID may not occur outside of the p ermitted visit window for 
Visit  5/Day  8. 
A safety follow -up visit (Visit 11/ Da y 42 + 5 days) will be performed 
for all those subjects who d o not rollover in to the long -term open -label 
study KAR -008. 
The study is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT 
in adult schizophreni a subjects with acute psychosis will result in 
significantly greater reduction (ie , improvement) in the primary and 
secondary endpoints at Week [ADDRESS_292046] and step down through 
the statistical testing of each endpoint using an alpha of 0.05. Statistical 
testing of change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, and PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, 
CGI-S score at Week 5 , and percentage of PANSS respond ers will be 
performed only if the primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 alpha level (P  ≤ 0.05), and testing would continue through a preordered list 
of key secondary efficacy endpoints. If at any point P > 0.05, then 
formal statistical testing would stop. This will control the overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

Page 20 of 95 5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background on Schizophrenia  
Schizophrenia is a long-term mental disorder involving a breakdown in the relation between 
thought, emotion, and behavior and leads to faulty percept ion, inappropriate actions and feelings, 
withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of mental fragmentation. Symptoms include delusions, hallucination, disorganized speech or 
behavior, and impaired cognitive a bility[ 1]. The prevalence of schizophrenia is between 0.6% 
and 1.9% in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  population[ 2]. Moreover, a claims analysis has estimated that 
the annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US  is 5.1 per 1000 lives[ 3]. It is found 
equally in males and females, with males usually having an earlier onset of symptoms[ 4]. 
The mainstay for treating schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs (APDs)[ 5]. All currently available 
antipsychotics act through blockage of all or subsets of dopamine receptors in the brain. First-generation APDs include chlorpromazine and haloperidol; treatment with  these agents is marked 
by [CONTACT_240462] (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia, and they consequently have limited use today. The second- generation agents that include risperidone, 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lurasidone, aripi[INVESTIGATOR_34770] e, and lumateperone tend to have lower levels of 
EPS or tardive dyskinesia and are currently the most commonly prescribed APD class. However, 
the second -generation drugs also have problematic side effects that include significant weight 
gain, metabolic dis turbances, sedation , and akathisia [6,7,8]. These side effects contribute to poor 
medication adherence resulting in frequent relapses and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602][ 9,10]. Thus there is a 
need for medications for schizophrenia which act through alternative mechanisms. 
Central muscarinic receptors have been hypothesized to be therapeutic treatments for 
schizophrenia based on several converging lines of evidence including both animal and human 
studies[ 11,12 ]. There are 5 subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1 -M5). The therapeutic effect of 
central muscarinic receptor agonism is thought to be due to agonism of M1 and M4 receptors in 
the central nervous system (CNS)[13 ]. However, compounds that agonize M1 and M4 receptors 
are often not specific enough not to also agonize M2 and M3 receptors outside of the CNS due to the highly conserved allosteric binding sites that the receptors share, leading to adverse events 
(AEs) related to activation of these peripheral receptors. Thus, any potential benefit of 
muscarinic agonis ts in schizophrenia (or other indications such as Alzheimer’s disease [AD] ) has 
been outweighed by [CONTACT_240463] (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation). 
5.2 Background on KarXT (Xanomeline Tartrate and Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240430])  
Xanomeline tartrate  is a muscarinic- cholinergic receptor agonist . It has agonistic activity at all 
5 muscarinic receptors but preferentially stimulates M
1 and M 4 receptors and binding to M 1 and 
M4 receptors in the CNS is thought to be responsible for the drug’s potential therapeutic effects 
(Roth, unpublished data). A recent study reports that xanomeline is a very potent M [ADDRESS_292062] in vivo, measured by [CONTACT_240464][ 14]. Xanomeline also enters the 
brain rapi[INVESTIGATOR_240431] a brain to plasma ratio of greater than 10 making it an attractive CNS 
drug candidate[ 15]. 
Xanomeline does not have any direct binding activity on dopaminergic receptors, suggesting that its mechanism of action  is unrelated to direct dopamine involvement. 
Previous double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials have provided strong evidence that xanomeline has clinically relevant antipsychotic efficacy.  In a multicenter outpatient trial in A D 
(N = 343), 3 doses of xanomeline (up to 225 mg/day) and placebo were assessed for 
26 weeks[ 16,17]. Significant dose-dependent improvements in psychotic symptoms relative to 
placeb o were observed. Moreover, psychotic symptoms resolved quite rapi[INVESTIGATOR_240432] s who 
were symptomatic at baseline and a dose dependent reduction in the emergence of psychotic 
symptoms versus placebo was also observed. In a completer analysis, cognitive imp rovement 
was also found suggesting longer treatment intervals may be necessary for cognitive enhancement [16,17]. In a subsequent small (N  = 20) double-blind, placebo-controlled inpatient 
trial in treatment resistant subjects with schizophrenia, xanomeline (225 mg/day) demonstrated 
robust and relatively rapid improvement in psychosis compared to placebo. In addition, 
improvement in both negative symptoms and cognitive impairment was observed [18]. 
In both the AD and schizophrenia trials, as well as in previous healthy volunteer studies, dose dependent “cholinergic” AEs were also reported, namely vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweating 
and hypersalivation. T hese side effects were frequent and, at the higher doses of xanomeline led 
to significant rates of discontinuation in the AD studies. This “ procholinergic” AE profile 
curtailed further development of xanomeline as a single agent.  
It is believed that the pr ocholinergic AEs associated with xanomeline are mediated by 
[CONTACT_240465]’s stimulation of peripheral  rather than central muscarinic receptors, which would 
make these AEs theoretically amenable to counteracting peripheral anticholinergic treatment. 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] c hloride is a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonist which binds to and antagonizes 
all five muscarinic receptor subtypes [19]. It is a commonly use d generic drug approved for over 
10 years by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA) and by [CONTACT_240466] [19]. Several human subject studies have 
demonstrated that trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240433], consistent with the 
drug’s quaternary ammonium structure [20]. 
KarXT is a novel combination of xanomeline tartrate and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240434]. Karuna 
hypothesized that the addition of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240435] 
(vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweating and hyper-salivation) and thus provide a strategy to allow 
xanomeline to be administered and stimulate brain muscarinic receptors with a decreased side 
effect burden. Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers of this combination demonstrated that KarXT reduced these side effects by 46% compared to xanomeline alone[ 21]. Moreover, the 
remaining cholinergic AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature, often lasting a few hours without recurrence and were generally single-epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. In general, 

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -[ADDRESS_292063] been exposed to xanomeline tartrate (oral 
formulation , either alone, in combination with trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], or as the combination drug KarXT ) in 
19 completed clinical studies conducted either by [CONTACT_240467] , some for as 
long as 3 years.  In those studies, significant improvements in cognition and reduced psychotic 
symptoms were observed. 
A study of xanomeline monotherapy in subjects with schizophrenia was reported in 2008[ 18]. In 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the effects of xanomeline were examined in 20 subjects with  schizophrenia 
utilizing a double -blind, placebo -controlled, 4-week study design. Subjects treated with 
xanomeline did significantly better than subjects in the placebo group on Brief Psychiatric 
Rating Scale total scores and PANSS total scores (ie, 24 -point change over placebo, P = 0.04). In 
the cognitive test battery, subjects in the xanomeline group showed impr ovements relative to 
placebo in some of the cognitive domains of verbal learning and short-term memory function. 
These studies demonstrated the potential for xanomeline as a treatment for psychosis and 
cognition across multiple subject populations.

Page 33 of 95 5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits o
f KarXT and Study Rationale  
The risks and benefits of KarXT in humans are not fully known. KarXT is a fixed dose 
combination of xanomeline and trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890].  The available clinical trial data indicate that KarXT 
has robust efficacy and a favorable safety profile that appears unique compared with all available APDs. Treatment with KarXT  is not associated with weight gain, sedation, or meaningful EPS 
changes. In contrast, these serious side effects pose a significant risk with other APD treatments 
for schizophrenia and can lead to discontinuation of treatment and significant morbidity. A Phase 
2 registration quality pi[INVESTIGATOR_240436] 182 subjects met the primary endpoint with the PANSS total 
score showing a 11.6 point mean improvement compared to placebo with a highly significant 
(P < 0.0001) separation from placebo (-17.4 KarXT vs -5.9 pla cebo) at W eek 5. KarXT, as 
compared with placebo, demonstrated highly significant reduction in PANSS total scores (P < 0.0001) at all post randomization time points (W eeks 2, 4, and, 5)  
 KarXT, as compared to placebo, demonstrated significant improvement 
at all post randomization time points for PANSS positive symptom subscores, PANSS negative 
symptom subscores, PANSS Marder Factor negative symptom subscores , and CGI -S scores.  
More than [ADDRESS_292064] been exposed to xanomeline tartrate (oral 
formulation , either alone, in combination with trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], or as the fixed dose combination drug 
KarXT) in clinical studies. These early clinical studies, as well as nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies, have not revealed any specific contraindications to the use of xanomeline. 
The most common side effects/symptoms are the cholinergic related effects: nausea, vomiting, 
excess salivation, excess sweating, and diarrhea. In addition, subjects treat ed with xanomeline 
alone have reported both syncope and orthostatic dizziness.  
 
 
Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240437] [ADDRESS_292065] frequently reported AEs 
reported in pi[INVESTIGATOR_240438],  abdominal pain, headache, urinary 
retention, and abnormal vision and accommodation. For ad ditional information, the package 
insert  for trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240439]. 
In a Phase 2 (K AR-004) clinical study, KarXT (100/20 and 125/30) significantly reduced the 
symptoms of schizophrenia  in subjects with acute psychosis after treatment for [ADDRESS_292066] common TEAEs being constipation, 

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -007 
KarXT  Final v1.4 
 
Page 34 of 95 nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting. All the reported TEAEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity.  One SAE (psychotic disorder) was reported by a single subject and no deaths were 
reported in the study. Ka rXT was generally well -tolerated and found to be safe in this patient 
population. 
KarXT represents a novel approach to the treatment of patients with  schizophrenia that will 
provide an important and meaningful alternative to current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The current tolerability and 
AE profile and the efficacy of KarXT justify further development of KarXT in this patient 
population by [CONTACT_240468] [ADDRESS_292067] andards as well as increased adherence.

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -[ADDRESS_292068] the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT will result in 
significantly greater reduction (ie , improvement) in the primary and secondary endpoints at 
Week 5 from baseline compared with placebo. Total study duration is up to 8 weeks, including a 7-day screening phase (up to a 7 -day extension of the screening phase is allowed, if necessary), a 
5 week treatment period, and a 7-day follow-up period (only for subjects who do not rollover to KAR-008 study). Subjects completing this study will have the option of rolling over into a 
long- term open -label study (KAR-008) in which every subject will receive KarXT. Study staff 
should discuss KAR- 008 protocol participation with potential subjects prior to the final day of 
participation in the acute study, via use of the provided recruitment materials.  
Screening Period : 
Screening of subjects will take place in 7 days or less before Day -1 (Days -8 to -2). Up to a 
7-day extension of the screening time is allowed, if necessary.  
A suitable number of subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 246 subjects across approximately 20 sites in the US. Subjects will be randomized through the IWRS in a 1:1  ratio to 
receive either KarXT or placebo for a treatment duration of 5  weeks. 
Treatment Period:  
In the treatment period, all subjects assigned to KarXT will start on a lead -in dose of 
KarXT  50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg/ trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the first 2 days  (Days 1 and 2) 
followed by [CONTACT_240469]  100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/ trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) BID for the remainder of 
Week  1 (Days 3 to 7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_292069] is continuing to experience AEs from the previous dose of KarXT 100/20 BID. All 
subjects who are increased to KarXT 125/[ADDRESS_292070] the option to return to KarXT 100/[ADDRESS_292071] not change after Visit 7 (Day 21) of the study and may be 
decreased for tolerability reasons no more than once during the study. In addition, dose 
escalation to KarXT  125/30 BID may not occur outside of the permitted visit window for 
Visit 5/Day 8. 
All randomized  subjects will have structured diagnostic interview sessions and questionnaires 
administered throughout the study (see Schedule of Assessments Table  2). Analyses of change 
from baseline in diagnostic measures will be performed.  
Efficacy assessments (PANSS scores and CGI -S score) will be assessed at scheduled visits. 
Refer to Section [ADDRESS_292072] 
circumference, orthostatic vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical 
chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and drug screen), , physical examination, and 
C-SSRS will be evaluated throughout the study as scheduled. Section 12 provides complete details on these safety assessments.  
Details on PK assessments are provided in Section 13. 
Safety Follow -up Period : 
A safety follow -up visit (Visit 11/ Day 42 + 5 days) will be performed for all those subjects who 
do not rollover into the long- term open -label study KAR -008. 
An Inde pendent Safety Monitoring Committee (ISMC) will be responsible for reviewing on a 
periodic basis the safety data from this study and confirming that the study may continue.

7.4 Independent Safety
 Monitoring Committee  
For the purpose of this study, the ISMC is an independent group of individuals with pertinent 
expertise that reviews on a regular basis accumulating safety  and tolerability  data from the 
clinical study. The ISMC will include 3 clinicians and a reporting statistician. This committee 
will be responsible, on a periodic basis, for confirming the safety  and tolerability  of KarXT 
throughout the study, with particular focus on assessing for any new toxicities that might be 
involved with KarXT. 
The reviews will be of unblinded data to allow a comparison of event rates and detection of 
safety signals across treatment groups to identify important safety information. The ISMC 
charter will c ontain the details of the types of data to be reviewed, the defined triggers for 
review, the minimum frequency of meetings (timed, if no triggers), and the communication plan for disseminating review recommendations.  

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -[ADDRESS_292074] meet all of  the following criteria to be included in the study:

14. Women of childbearing potential (WOC BP) , or men w hose sexual partners are 
WOCBP , must willing and able to adhere to the contraception guidelines as defined in 
Section 8.4.1  
8.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Individuals meeting any of the following criteria at screening or baseline are ineligible to 
participate in this study: 
1. Any primary DSM-5 disorder other than schizophrenia within 12 months before screening (confirmed using MINI version 7.0.2 at screening). Exclusionary disorders include, but are not limited to , moderate to severe alcohol use disorder (within the past 
12 months), substance (other than nicotine or caffeine) use disorder within the past 12 months (use of cannabis at screening will result in screen failure with the allowance 
to rescreen at a later date if no moderate to severe substance use disorder is determined), major depressive disorder, bipolar I or II disorder, schizoaffective disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and post- traumatic stress disorder. Symp toms of mild mood 
dysphoria or anxiety are allowed as long as these symptoms are not the primary focus of treatment.  
a. A screening subject with mild substance abuse disorder within the [ADDRESS_292079] abnormalities, hepatobiliary carcinoma, and/or 
active hepatic viral infections based on either medical history or liver function test results.  
5. History or high risk of urinary retention, gastric retention, or narrow- angle  glaucoma. 
6. History of irritable bowel syndrome (with or without constipation) or serious constipation requiring treatment within the last 6 months.  
7. Risk for suicidal behavior during the study as determined by [CONTACT_093]’s clinical 
assessment and C -SSRS as confirmed by [CONTACT_716]: 

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -[ADDRESS_292080] be recorded on the electronic case report for m (eCRF ). Subjects who 
complete or discontinue early from the study will be discharged  from the study site , if clinically 
warranted  after completing all the Visit 10/early termination  assessments as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
Note: A safety follow -up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Treatment/Early 
Termination visit (Visit 10) for those subjects who do not roll over into the long -term open- label 
study KAR-008. 
In the event that a subject discontinues prematurely from the study because of a TEAE or serious 
TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEAE will be followed up until it resolves (returns to normal or 
baseline values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged by [CONTACT_240471].  
Once a subject  is withdrawn from the study, the subject will not re- enter the study.  
A subject  may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• progressive disease  
• unacceptable toxicity or AE  
• subject withdrawal of consent: at any time a subject ’s participation in the study may be 
terminate d at his/her request.  The reason for subject  withdrawal will be noted on the 
eCRF.  
• on the basis of the investigator’s clinical judgement 
• intercurrent illness:  a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the prim ary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the subject ’s termination from the 
study 
• general or specific changes in the subject ’s condition that renders him/her ineligible for 
further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria  (eg, subject has need for a 
medication prohibited by [CONTACT_760]) 
• subject fails to adhere to the protocol requirements (eg, drug noncompliance [if a study 
subject is off study drug for >5 days in a row])

Page 46 of 95 • violation of entry criteria; ie, subject s who are enrolled but are later discovered not to 
meet entry criteria  
• development of suicidal or assaultive behavior 
• alcohol or illegal drug use 
• pregnancy, as indicated in Section 12.7.8. Any study subject who becomes pregnant 
while participating in the study will be unblinded to study treatment randomization. If she is found to be on active treatment assignment, she will be followed until her pregnancy 
reaches term.  
• Sponsor’s decision to discontinue study. 
Subject s withdrawing from the study will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations 
as subjects completing the s tudy according to this protocol, particularly safety evaluations. The 
aim is to record data in the same way as for subject s who completed the study. 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact [CONTACT_1130] s who leave the unit or are lost to follow -up. 
These effo rts must be documented in the subject’s file. Subjects with AEs ongoing at end of 
study will be followed until the AE is resolved  (regardless of whether they enroll in the 
long- term open -label study KAR-008) or the subject  is considered to be in stable con dition. 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in case of SAEs or if special circumstances concerning the study drug become known, making further treatment of subject s 
impossible. In this event, the investigator(s) will be informed of the reason for study termination. 
 Pregnancy  
No evidence of mutagenicity, or treatment effects on reproduction, fertility, or fetal parameters 
have been demonstrated in animals following administration of xanomeline, but there are no 
adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women (FDA Pregnancy Category B). Animal 
reproduction studies of trospi[INVESTIGATOR_240444], but potential benefits may warrant the use of the drug in pregnant women despi[INVESTIGATOR_042] (FDA 
Pregnancy Category C). 
Therefore, WOCBP  in this study must be willing to use a highly effective method of birth 
control  
during the study and for [ADDRESS_292081] on Day - 1 (before receiving KarXT) and 
thereafter, as designated at other scheduled visits ( Table  2). In case of positive urine pregnancy 
test result, a serum sample should be sent to the central laboratory to confirm the result.  
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of KarXT on  the developi[INVESTIGATOR_240445].  
Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment 
of the mother with KarXT , women who are breastfeeding must  not be enrolled in the study. 

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -[ADDRESS_292082]  to undue risk will be performe d. See Section 
12.7.8 for further reporting and monitoring details.  
Full details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the withdrawal page (exit form) of the eCRF, or 
a pregnancy report  will be completed if the sub ject has completed the study. Notification of the 
pregnancy should be submitted via  the Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24  hours of knowledge 
of the pregnancy. Pregnancy is not to be considered an AE; however, it must be reported using 
the same procedure a s described for reporting SAE (Section 12.7.4) .

8.6 Study Termination  
The availability of any new adverse safety information related to KarXT may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. An investigator, Sponsor, or Independent Ethics Committee (I EC)/ Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) may take such actions. If the study is terminated for safety reasons, subjects will be notified immediately and assured that appropriate treatment and follow -up will be 
available. If an investigator terminates the study , the Sponsor, subjects, and IEC/ IRB will be 
informed about the reason for such action. Similarly, if the Sponsor terminates the study, it will 
inform the investigators, the IEC/ IRB, and the subjects of the reason for such an action. Similar 
notifications will be sent by [CONTACT_6179]/ IRB if it takes such an action.

for Medicinal Products and the relevant regulatory requirements.  
Bulk supply bottles are labeled with the name [CONTACT_18467], recommended storage conditions, the name [CONTACT_4547] , and the Investigational Use Statement (“Caution: New 
Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_4496] [US] Law to Investigational Us e”). 
Further details on labelling of investigational products will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
 Study Drug Storage  
KarXT and placebo must be stored at controlled room temperature  15 C-25 C in a secured 
location with no access
 to unauthorized personnel.  
 Study Drug Retention  
Study drug not used in KAR-007 may be used for the long-term extension study (KAR-008). Therefore, unused study drug for this particular study must be retained until completion or 
termination of the KarXT program, and written authorization from the Sponsor has been 
received. The unused study drug can be reassigned in the IWRS to subjects in the KAR -[ADDRESS_292086] be destroyed at the site or returned, as specified by 
[CONTACT_2728]. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the Sponsor has provided written 
authorization prior to return or destruction, and that appropriate records of the disposal are 
documented and maintained. No used or unused study drug may be disposed until fu lly 
accounted for by [CONTACT_11200]. 
9.[ADDRESS_292087] dose will 
be administered in the morning of Visit 10 (Day  35 -2 days). The study drug should be 
administered daily  BID on an empty stomach ie , at least 1 hour before a meal  or 2 to 3 hours 
after a meal. Some considerations for dosing and PK blood withdrawals are provided in the 
subsections below. 
 Visit 2 b/Day 1 Randomization and Dosing 
• The first dose will be administered in the morning , and the evening dose will be 
administered 12 ± 0.5 hours after the morning dose. 
• All subjects must be administered 4 dosages of the KarXT 50/20 or placebo before dose 
escalation  to KarXT 100/20 or placebo BID. 
 Visit 3/Day 3 and/or Visits Occurring on Weekends/Holidays  
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 100/20 or placebo level is confirmed by i nvestigator 
order on Visit 3/Day 3, that dose is to be administered in the morning. 
• When Day [ADDRESS_292088] ’s dose will be escalated on Day 3. 

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -007 
KarXT  Final v1.4 
 
Page 50 of 95 • If completion of the visit is not possible on Day 3, the +1-day visit window may be used. 
In this instance, the dose will not be escalated  until the study visit occurs. In all cases, the 
subject must have had at least 4 doses of KarXT 50/20 or placebo before escalating  to 
KarXT  100/20 or placebo. 
• This may res ult in only 4 days of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo dose at Visit 5/D ay 8, 
which is acceptable.  
• All subjects must be administered 8 doses of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo before dose 
escalation to KarXT 125/30 or placebo BID. 
 Visit 5/Day 8 Dosing and PK C onsiderations and Visit 8 /Day 28 PK C onsiderations  
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 125/30 or placebo level is confirmed by i nvestigator 
order on Visit 5/Day 8, that dose is to be administered in the morning (after the predose PK blood draw) to allow for serial postdose PK blood draws per protocol ( Table  2, 
Footnote  p). 
• Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK sampling must  accompan y the 
actual day of dose escalation  for Visit 5.  
• For Visit [ADDRESS_292089]’ s final 
KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses ; there fore, there  must be no 
changes in dose for at least [ADDRESS_292090] accompany the 
actual day of Visit 8  if a window is used. 
 Visit 10/Day 35 Dosing 
• All subjects will receive their final dose of KarXT or placebo on the morning of Visit 10/Day 35. 
9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment  Assignment  
 Method of Study Treatment Assignment  
At Screening, the interactive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique subject identification number to the subject known as the Subject Number. This number will be 
associated with the subject throughout the study. Every subject who signs an ICF must be 
entered into the IWRS regardless of eligibility in order to obtain a Subject Number. This 9- digit 
number will consist of a  3-digit study code and a 3-digit site identification followed by a 3- digit 
subject number assigned sequentially within each site, starting at 001.  
On Day - 1, all eligible subject s will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_292091] generated by  
. Active and placebo study drug will be provided in bulk to each site particip ating in 
the study. For each dose, study drug and packaging will be identical in size, shape, color, and 
appearance (see Section 9.1.2). No other study site personnel (except the pharmacist or other 
designated unblinded individual) , subject s, informants, Sponsor personnel, or Sponsor designees 
(eg, Sponsor’s Medical Monitor) will be unblinded to treatment assignment throughout the 
duration of the study unless unblinding is required. Both active study drug and placebo will be 
supplied as identical matching capsules. This prevents bias on the part of the study staff and the 
subject to influence the results of the study.  
If an investigator becomes unblinded to a given subject ’s study treatment, that subject  will be 
discontinued from the study unless there are ethical reasons for that subject  not to be 
discontinued; approval from the Sponsor/medical monitor must be obtained in such instances. 
 will generate and maintain the security of the randomization code. In the event that 
emergency unblinding is required for a given subject  because of  AEs or concerns for the 
subject ’s safety  or wellbeing, the investigator may break the randomization code for just th at 
subject via the IWRS , by [CONTACT_240472]/Sponsor. The unblinding and its cause will also be 
documented in the eCRF. Unblinding according to the protocol will occur only after completion of the study. 
If an AE is thought to be related to the study drug and poses a safety risk, the investigator must 
decide whether  to stop investigational treatment and/or treat the subject. Subject withdrawal 
should be avoided, if possible. If discontinuation of treatment occurs, every attempt should be 
made to restart study drug if medically appropriate, whatever the duration of discontinuation. 
When a subject  has an AE that requires that the investigator be unblinded, the investigator can 
obtain the treatment assignment from the IWRS system. The site is expected to notify the study medical monitor before breaking the study blind unless it is in the subject ’s best interest if the 
blind is broken immediately. Note: In most circumstances, it is not necessary to unblind a subject, even if an SAE has occurred. For many drugs there is no specific therapy for AEs. The 
appropriate course of action is to stop the investigational drug and treat the signs and symptoms 
resulting from the AE.  
The members of the ISMC will be unblinded as they review the safety data from the study.  
9.4 Dose Modification 
Subjects will be dosed as described in Section 7.1  and in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  2). The study drug doses were selected based on the previous preclinical and 
clinical studies (see Section  5.2). Per the protocol, subject s will be evaluated for dose 
adjustments at Visits 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_292092] , and the 
return of materials to the Sponsor or designee  for storage or disposal.  These records should 
include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], temperature log, and unique 
code numbers assigned to the product and study subjects. 
Administration of study drug will be supervised by [CONTACT_240473]. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the subject s were provided 
with the correct study treatment bulk supply and reconcile the products received from the drug 
dispensing center. Investigational product will not be returned to the Sponsor or designee until 
accountability has been fully monitored through the end of the study. Study drug accountability 
will be assessed periodically by [CONTACT_240474].

dosing. Orthostatic vital signs are only required after the morning  dose of the specified visit days, but additional orthostatic vital sign monitoring is 
allowed at the investigator ’s discretion. It would be a cceptable, for example, to do orthostatic vital signs BID after dosing increases for a day or [ADDRESS_292096] be approved for use by [CONTACT_240477] I EC/IRB. Before performing 
any study- related procedures, the investigator (or designee) will obtain written informed consent 
from the subject . 
10.2 Study Procedures 
Assessments and their timings are to be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  2). Section  12.6 specifies laboratory assessment samples to be obtained.  
Assessments and procedures scheduled at a visit where study drug is administered should be performed before administration of treatment unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  2). 
Efficacy  assessments are described in Section 11 and include PANSS and CGI -S scores. 
Safety assessments are described in Section 12 and include spontaneous AEs ; AESIs, 
procholinergic and anticholinergic  symptoms ;  SAS; BARS ; 
AIMS ; body weight; BMI ; waist circumference ; orthostatic vital signs ; ECG; clinical laboratory 
assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and drug screen) ;  
 physical examination; and C- SSRS . 
PK assessments are described in Section [ADDRESS_292097] igator may , at his/her discretion , arrange for a subject  to have an unscheduled 
assessment, especially in the case of AEs that require follow  up or are considered by [CONTACT_190370]. The unscheduled visit page in the 
eCRF must be completed. The assessments and procedures that may be performed during an 
unscheduled visit are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). Additional asse ssments 
can be performed as needed, at the discretion of the investigator , and after discussion with the 
medical monitor. 
Study discontinuation procedures are described in Sections 8.4  and 8.6.

with schizophrenia and is widely used in the study of antipsychotic therapy[ 22]. The PANSS 
rating form contains [ADDRESS_292099] er Factor.  
It is recommended, if at all possible, that the PANSS assessment should be performed before all 
the other scale assessments (except MINI  at screening ) for all visits at which it is performed.  
11.2 Clinical Global Impression‒Severity  
The CGI -S is a rating scale completed independently by a clinician that is  used to measure illness 
and symptom severity in subject s with mental disorders . It is used to rate the severity of a 
subject’s illness at the time of assessment. The modified CGI -S asks the clinician 1  question: 
“Considering your total clinical experience, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The 
clinician’s answer is rated on the following 7 -point scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline 
mentally ill; 3  = mildly ill; 4  = moderately i ll; 5 = markedly ill; 6  = severely ill; 7  = among the 
most extremely ill subjects[23]. 
This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 
[ADDRESS_292100] the 
average severity level across the previous 7 days.

Safety assessments ( spontaneous AEs; AESIs, procholinergic and anticholinergic symptoms ; 
 SAS; BARS ; AIMS ; body weight; BMI ; waist circumference ; 
orthostatic vital signs ; ECG ; clinical laboratory assessments [hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, urinalysis, and drug screen]; physical examination ; and C- SSRS) are to be 
performed at protocol- specified visits, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
12.[ADDRESS_292101] s at Screening.  The information to be captured 
includes date of birth (alternatively year of birth if full date of birth is not allowed to be collected 
for legal reasons), age, sex, race and ethnicity , which will be obtained from the subject and 
recorded in the eCRF.  
Medical and psychiatric history will be recorded at screening. Investigators should document the 
occurrence, signs, and symptoms of the  subject ’s preexisting conditions , including all baseline 
symptoms, ongoing illnesses, other chronic conditions, and surgical history at screening. Medical 
history will also include history of drug, substance, or alcohol abuse/dependence within [ADDRESS_292102] occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness during the study are to be documented as AEs on the e CRF  in accordance with Section  12.7. All 
changes not present at baseline or described in the past medical history and identified as clinica lly noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
12.2 Vital Signs  
Orthostatic vital signs (systolic and diastolic BP  and heart rate measurements) will be evaluated 
at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). All vital signs will be measured 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_240441] 2 minutes. BP measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the 
duration of the study. During treatment, beginning with Day 1 , orthostatic vital signs should 
occur 2 (±1) hours after morning dosing. Orthostatic vital signs are only required after the 
morning dose of the specified visit days, but additional orthostatic vital sign monitoring is 
allowed at the investigator ’s discreti on. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. Out- of-range BP  or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the investigator’s 
discretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measure ments must be recorded as 
AEs.

Page 64 of 95 12.3 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination ( body temperature, general appearance, 
head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, examination of thorax and abdomen, assessment of cardiac, 
musculoskeletal, and circulatory systems, palpations for lymphadenopathy, and limited 
neurological examination) will be performed at visits as specified in Table  2. Physical 
examinations will be pe rformed by a physician or qualified designee. 
12.[ADDRESS_292103] Circumference  
Height (screening only), weight, and waist circumference measurements will be obtained at visits 
as specified in Table  2. BMI  should be calculated at these visits. All findings should be recorded 
in the eCRF.  
12.5 Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead, resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Sch edule of Assessments 
(Table  2). During the ECG, ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and 
QTcF (msec) measurements will be obtained . ECG at Day 1 will be performed 2 hours 
(+ 15 minutes ) post morning dose. ECGs at all other scheduled visits will be performed before 
blood withdrawal for any safety laboratory tests and/or PK analysis.  
All the ECGs obtained will be interpreted by [CONTACT_240478] (s) at the 
central readi ng facility . 
At screening, the investigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that could exclude the subject from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if the 
ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be 
repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present.  
12.6 Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory assessment samples ( Table  3) are to be obtained at designated visits as detailed in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -[ADDRESS_292104]  
enrolled in the study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study 
inclusion; the medical condition should be reported in the subject ’s medical history.  
In accordance with the protocol, the investigator and/or study staff will elicit AEs and intercurrent illness during and at the end of the study period, and these will be recorded on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF. AEs will be elicited by [CONTACT_63397] a nonleading question, 
for example, “Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked?” The 
eCRF will be completed at the end of the study as soon as the results of the final lab oratory  tests 
are available.  
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the e CRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from th e 
time immediately after the administration of study drug on Day 1  until the End of Study  
 
or early termination . Follow up of the AE, even after the date of therapy discontinuation, 
is required if the AE persists until the event resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum intensity for the ev ent should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (NCI -CTCAE) , version 5.0 (Grades 1 through 5). 
Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by [CONTACT_240479]  4 and Table 5. 
Table  4. Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_240480] : An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_19578] , causing minimal discomfort  and not interfering with 
everyday activities.  
MODERATE : An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
SEVERE : An event that prevents normal everyday activities.

causes (disease, environment, etc).  
UNLIKELY : This category ap plies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the test  drug but for which 
no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related to study drug if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reaso nable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test drug ; (2) it could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_240482], environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it does not follow a known patte rn of 
response to the test drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the drug  is readministered.  
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the test drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when 
it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug. 
PROBABLY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the test drug . An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_240483], environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases  on cessation or reduction 
in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia);  or (4) it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug . 
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to test 
drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612] ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with reexposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it follows a known pattern 
of response to the test drug. 
Abbreviation:  AE, adverse event.  
 
 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The AEs of special interest will be monitored  and include o rthostasis and liver function test 
elevations inclusive of DILI. 
AEs of special interest should be recorded as AEs and reported as SAEs when appropriate. 
 Serious Adverse Events 
A, SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, 
that: 
• results in death,  
• is life -threatening, 
• results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing, nonworsening condition is not,

f 95 however, considered an SAE ; the details of such hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68431]), 
• results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity , and/or 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs  if they are 
thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. S AEs are critically important for the identification of significant 
safety problems; theref ore, it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the 
Sponsor’s assessment. If either the Sponsor or the investigator believes that an event is serious, the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_240484]. 
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An SAE occurring from the time first dose of the study drug is administered , during the study, or 
within [ADDRESS_292105] be reported within 24 hours of occurrence 
or when the investigator becomes aware of the event . Notification can be made using email . 
 email address  is:  
The events must be recorded on the standard AE eCRF. Preliminary reports of SAEs must be 
followed up by [CONTACT_202852], including clear and anonymized photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_73932], consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested 
and applicable. SAE reports must be made whether or not the investigator considers the event to 
be related to the investigational drug.  
Appropriate re medial measures should be taken to treat the SAE, and the response should be 
recorded. The investigator must report all additional follow -up evaluations to the  
within [ADDRESS_292106] ’s 
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to 
baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the study 
drug or procedures. 
 Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
The sponsor has incorporated the following for monitoring of the drug induced liver injury: 
• An increase of serum ALT or AST to >3 × upper limit of normal ( ULN) should be 
followed by [CONTACT_94525] 48 to 72 hours of all 4 of the usual serum measures 

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -007 
KarXT  Final v1.4 
 
Page 70 of 95 (ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin) to confirm the abnormalities and to determine if 
they are increasing or decreasing. An inquiry should be made about the sy mptoms 
(fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, and rash). 
• Close observation should be initiated with ALT or AST >3 × ULN:  
o Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests [ADDRESS_292107] is asymptomatic. 
o Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  
o Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications 
and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug 
use, and special diets. 
o Rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary 
tract disease.  
o Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents. 
o Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (eg, international 
normalized ratio, direct bilirubin).  
o Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. 
• Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if: 
o ALT or AST >8  × ULN  
o ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than [ADDRESS_292108] >3  × ULN and (total bilirubin >2 × ULN or international normalized 
ratio >1.5) 
o ALT or AST >3  × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia (>5%) 
• Hepatic adjudication of cases should include an evaluation for alternative causes such as 
viral, autoimmune, alcohol, hepatobiliary disorders, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, 
concomitant medications, etc. 
• Follow up to resolution of elevated liver enzymes.  
• Gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase elevations alone should not prompt drug 
discontinuation. 
 Trial Discontinuation Criteria Other than DILI and Pregnancy  
[IP_ADDRESS] Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_240450] v5.0, study drug will be discontinued in any subject who has a ≥  Grade 4

a. Continue the clinical study without modification; or  
b. Continue the clinical study with modification (listing the specific modifications 
recommended); or 
c. Terminate the study.  

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -[ADDRESS_292110] notify the 
Sponsor (or designee) of any female subject or female partner of a male subject that becomes 
pregnant while participating in the study. Any known cases of pregnancy in femal e subject s will 
be reported until the subject  completes or withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be 
reported immediately by [CONTACT_29658]/emailing a completed pregnancy report to the Sponsor (or 
designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an 
SAE; however, the investigator will follow -up with the subject  until completion of the pregnancy 
and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than [ADDRESS_292111] 
to discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
The investig ator should notify the Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by 
[CONTACT_17258] a follow -up pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy involved spontaneous 
or therapeutic abortion (any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be

12.10 Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale 
The B ARS  is a rating scale used to assess the severity of drug -induced akathisia, or restlessness, 
involuntary movements and inability to sit still. The range of scores is 0 to 14, with higher scores 
indicating greater severity[25]. 

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -[ADDRESS_292113]’s level of awareness of 
the movements. Items are scored f rom 0 (none) to 4 (severe). A higher score indicates more 
severe dyskinesia.  
12.12 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs (suicidal behavior 
and suicidal ideation) throughout the study[ 26]. The strength of this suicide classification system 
is in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over identification 
of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to administer. The C -SSRS will be 
administered by a trained rater at the site.  
This study will utilize 2  versions of the C-SSRS. At the screening visit, the “lifetime”  version 
will be co mpleted; for all subsequent visits the “Since Last Visit” version of the C -SSRS will be 
administered.

Assuming treatment difference of change from baseline in  PANSS total score  at Week 5 is  
8 points between drug and placebo (standard deviation 16) , a sample size of approximately 
172 (86 evaluable subjects per arm) will result in a power of 90 .3% for a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 
(P ≤ 0.05). With a dropout rate of 30%, a total of [ADDRESS_292114] s are estimated to be enrolled . 
14.2 Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat Population  
All subjects who are randomized to the study will be included in the intent- to-treat (ITT) 
population. 
Modified ITT Population 
All subjects who are randomized, received at least [ADDRESS_292115] 1 measurable plas ma concentration of study drug.

Page 80 of 95 14.4 Efficacy Analysis  
 Primary Estimand  
The population of the primary estimand is among adult inpatients (aged 18-65 years) with a 
DSM -5 diagnosis of schizophrenia, confirmed by [CONTACT_240485], who are acutely 
psychotic and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240452] 80 to 120 at time of enrollment, defined according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects will receive flexible dose KarXT, whereby 
a subject receiving 100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 20 mg) may be titrated upwards to 
KarXT 125/30 on Day 8. All subjects who are increased to 125/[ADDRESS_292116] the option to 
return to KarXT 100/20, but may not change their dose after Visit 7 (Day 21) or decrease their 
dose f or tolerability reasons more than once. The primary analysis will be executed on the mITT 
population, including all subjects with a baseline and at least [ADDRESS_292117]- baseline PANSS 
measurement, grouped as randomized. 
The variable is the change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5.

assessments: While on treatment strategy where efficacy results recorded p rior to subject 
discontinuation from the study will be included in the analysis 
• Use of concomitant medication for anxiety and/or sleep aid: Treatment policy strategy where results will be used regardless of concomitant medications for anxiety and/or sleep aid 
The population level summary is the difference between treatment groups (KarXT vs placebo) in mean change from baseline in PANSS at Week 5, obtained from a mixed model repeated 
measures (MMRM).  
 
 
 
 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in PANSS total score at 
Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo at Week [ADDRESS_292118] correlation will be accounted for using 
an unstructured covariance matrix. Fixed effects will include the treatment g roup ( KarXT  or 
placebo), visit, and the interaction between the treatment group and visit, site, age, sex, and 
baseline PANSS total  score. Low-enrolling sites may be pooled, if necessary, for modeling 
purposes. The algorithm for pooling sites will be speci fied in the SAP. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint may be performed on an observed case 
basis, using multiple imputation techniques, and classifying treatment dropouts as treatment 
failures. Alternative time -varying parameterizations of dose level and use of concomitant 
medication for anxiety and/or sleep aid may also be included in sensitivity analyses. In addition, alternative covariance matrices for the MMRM may be investigated. The sensitivity analyses of 
the primary endpoint will be specified in the SAP. 
 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The continuous secondary endpoints (change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, and CGI -S) will be analyzed in 
the same manner as the primary efficacy analysis (ie, using MMRM). 
The categorical secondary endpoint (percentage of PANSS responders at Week 5) will be 
compared between the treatment groups ( KarXT  and placebo) using the Cochran- Mantel -
Haenszel test.  
The statistical analysis of the primary and key secondary efficacy variables will account for 
multiplicity by [CONTACT_2329] a fixed sequence testing procedure. This testing procedure will control the 
overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

Page 82 of 95 14.5 Safety Analysis 
All reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 
22.1 or higher. The incidence of TEAEs (events with onset dates on or after the start of the study 
drug) will be summarized for each treatment group separately by [CONTACT_177346]. All AEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], along with information regarding onset, 
duration, relationship and severity to study drug, action taken  with study drug, treatment of 
event, and outcome. 
Orthostatic vital signs, clinical laboratory data,  ECG parameters, and physical 
examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including observed  and change 
from baseline v alues, as well as numbers of subject s with values outside limits of the normal 
range at each time point by [CONTACT_1570]. Similar descriptive summaries will be provided for 
SAS, BARS ,  AIMS, body weight, BMI, and waist 
circumference . 
14.[ADDRESS_292119] will include C
max, Tmax, and 
AUC from 0 to 12 hours (or from [ADDRESS_292120] measurable concentration ). Additional parameters 
(not l imited to the following) such as the elimination half- life, clearance, and volume of 
distribution will be determined if the data permit.  
The effect of dose on PK and other inferential analyses for exposure-response relationship may be performed. The detail s of the PK analysis will be described in the SAP. The 
noncompartmental analysis will be de scribed as a part of final clinical study report. 
14.7 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned for this study. 
14.8 Handling of Missing Data  
Several different methods to handle the missing data in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
may be used.  

Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -007 
KarXT  Final v1.4 
 
Page 83 of 95 • For the primary efficacy analysis, likelihood-based modeling approach will be used to 
handle incomplete data. For this purpose, an MMRM will be appl ied. 
• Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the last observation carried forward approach. In this analysis, the missing values will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_240486].  
• Sensitivity an alysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the 
Multiple Imputation approach (ie, by [CONTACT_240487] a set of plausible 
values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute ).

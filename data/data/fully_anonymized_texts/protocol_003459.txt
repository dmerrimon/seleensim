V. HYPOTHESIS  
In the ICU, spouses often find themselves in a stressful environment, expected to manage surrogate health 
decisions for their critically ill loved one. Evidence in the literature suggest higher stress levels experienced 
by [CONTACT_435452], increase s their risk for Post Intensive Care Syndrome 
(PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] ).3,4,12,14,17,18,28,34,41 Reducing stress in the spouse during the ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435431] . We hypothesize that participant s who receive the Sensation Awareness Focus Training 
(SĀF-T) intervention will experience less P ICS than control participant s who do not receive the intervention.  
 
VI. SPECIFIC AIMS  
The primary  specific aim of the proposed project is to test the feasibility and determine effect size of the SĀF-T 
intervention on PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599], specifically  spouses of critically ill, mechanically ventilated patie nts. We will carefully 
examine the ability of participants to adequately perform SĀF-T and adhere to the study protocol. A secondary 
aim of this project is to explore if the effect of SĀF-T and sleep/rest are related. Findings from this feasibility 
study will be used to design a dissertation study with adequate power to test SĀF-T. 
 
VII. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Significance  
More than 5.7 million patients are admitted to intensive care units (ICU) each year in the [LOCATION_002].37 The 
technologically advanced ICU is an unfamiliar frightening environment to patients and their families.1 Critical

Pro00026246    Version: 1.4                              Date: 08/28/17       Page | [ADDRESS_551552] Intensive Care Syndrome -Family (PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -
F). PI[INVESTIGATOR_435432], depression, and 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Data suggest that 70% of family m embers have symptoms of anxiety and 
33% have symptoms of depression and PTSD, which can persist for ≥[ADDRESS_551553] longer in family members than in adult ICU survivors .11 
Becaus e PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F occurs with greater frequency in spouses and surrogate health decision -makers4,27,34 this study 
will focus on participant s whom are spouses of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults (typi[INVESTIGATOR_435433]).  
 
To date, the focus of PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F research has been on description, detection, and prevalence of PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F. The 
approach in the proposed project focuses on prevention of PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F using an innovative rapid stress reduction 
intervention. The Rosenzweig Cent er for Rapid Recovery29 has recently developed an adaptation of their 
Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) for psychological trauma and depression, called Sensation Awareness 
Focused Training (SĀF-T), as an approach to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_435434]. SĀF-T 
is designed to elicit a calming response; interrupt negative thoughts, negative feelings, and negative behaviors; 
and ultimately serve as a self -management stress reduction  method  for individuals. Lateral left -right (saccadic) 
eye movements are used to elicit an orienting response that activates an investigatory reflex in which first, an 
alert response occurs and then, a reflexive pause produces decreased arousal in the face  of no threat,5,30,32 which  
elicits a calming response that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_435435].  A reflexive pause is 
our immediate response of exploratory behavior , with more flexible and efficient cognitive processes , to 
respond in a state of heightened awareness.43 This response process is consistent with behavior of interpretation 
and reaction to challenge  in McEwen’s Allostasis Stress Theory.[ADDRESS_551554] the  SĀF-T intervention will  
enable spouses to better manage stress and reduce risk of PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F.  
 
Sleep deprivation has been self -reported as one of the top stressors of family members of ICU patients.25,26,40 
Sleep adequacy is defined as a combination of three factors: latency (the t ime it takes to fall asleep), efficiency 
([time spent sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ÷ total time in bed] × 100), and duration of sleep.[ADDRESS_551555] 
85% of the time they are in bed, and have a total sleep time of no less than [ADDRESS_551556] on sleep.6 Therefore,  management of stress in spouse s throughout the daytime may also improve 
nighttime sleep/rest and further reduce risk of PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F.

IX. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Research Design  
We will use a prospective, randomized, experimental design to accomplish the specific aims. Participant s 
(n=10 ) will be randomly assigned within 36 hours of the patient’ s ICU admission  and intubation  to one of two 
groups. The  intervention group will rec eive the SĀF-T intervention daily, over a 3 -day period (72  hours) or 
until discharge of the patient  from  the ICU, if discharged within 3 days. The control group will not receive the  
SĀF-T intervention . Usual  care for spouses of critically ill patients will continue for both groups .  
Sample. A feasibility sample size of 10 participant s will be randomly assigned  (using a blocked design)  to two 
groups (n=5 intervention group, n=5 control group). Eligibility  criteria:  spouses of patients intubated and

Pro00026246    Version: 1.4                              Date: 08/28/17       Page | [ADDRESS_551557] 36 hours, and  spouse  is 
aged 18 years  or older , and is able to understand English . Exclusion criteria : anticipation by [CONTACT_435453] p atient death, spouse does not understand English , under the age of 18 years old, or is  
active ly being treated for  a PI[INVESTIGATOR_435436] ( anxiety, depression, PTSD ). 
Setting . Participant  recruitment, enrollment, and interventions w ill be conducted at Tampa General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(TGH), a level I trauma center with [ADDRESS_551558] established 
excellent research relationships at TGH, as both principal investigator (PI) Paula Cairns  and her US F faculty 
adviser /co-investigator  [CONTACT_435464] are credentialed by [CONTACT_435454].  
 
Methods  
Group Assignment. Randomized assignment will be used to determine the group (intervention or control) for 
participants. Each participant will have an equal chance of being assign ed to receiving the intervention . Usual 
care by [CONTACT_435455] (intervention and control). A randomized block 
design wil l be used for equal sample size in each group. Randomized group  assignment  will be generated at 
randomizer.org and  concealed inside opaque, sealed envelopes. Following signed consent, each participant will 
have an equal chance of receiving the intervention  with the opening of a sealed group assignment envelope.  
Descr iption of Intervention and Data Collection Procedures. Data collection will take approximately 30 
minutes at four time points: study enrollment,  study day [ADDRESS_551559] on the participant’s wrist at the time of study 
enrollment, which will collect continuous activity and light data over a 3 -day period (72 hours) or until 
discharge of the pa tient from the ICU, if discharged within 3 days . The SĀF-T intervention will take 
approximately 15 -20 minutes each day, over a 3 -day period (72 hours) or until discharge of the patient from the 
ICU, if discharged within 3 days . Descriptions of procedures f or each group are as follows.  
1) Intervention Group: The SĀF-T intervention includes coaching from SĀF-T trained research staff on 
awareness of biological sensations associated with events in the ICU that are perceived stressful. Research staff 
will sit ac ross from the participant and ask them to use their eyes to follow hand movements that will induce  
lateral left -right (saccadic) eye movemen ts and  elicit an orienting response that activates an investigatory reflex 
in which first, an alert response occurs  and then, a reflexive pause produces decreased arousal in the face of no 
threat.5,30,32  The SĀF-T intervention will be administered each day, by [CONTACT_7628], over 3 -days (72 
hours) or until discharge of the patient from the ICU, if discharged within 3 days. The emphasis on the SĀF-T 
intervention on days 2 & 3 will be practicing to independently use the technique as needed by [CONTACT_435456]-manage stress. Participants will continue to receive usual care practices by [CONTACT_435457] (orientation to 
ICU patient room and ICU waiting room, use of bathroom and shower in patient’s room, review of ICU visiting 
policy with contact [CONTACT_3031], optional guest food tray, and other onsite locations to acquire food  and 
beverages, clean towels,  warm b lankets, and resources for spi[INVESTIGATOR_69276] ). 
2) Control Group: The control group will consist of usual care. There will be no SĀF-T intervention, but 
participants will continue to receive support by [CONTACT_435457], as part of usual care practices ( orient ation to ICU 
patient room and ICU waiting room, use of bathroom and shower in patient’s room, review of ICU visiting 
policy with contact [CONTACT_3031], optional guest food tray and other onsite locations to acquire food and 
beverages, clean towels, warm blan kets, and resources for spi[INVESTIGATOR_69276] ), which may reduce their level of 
stress. Participants will remain in the study in the ICU over 3 -days (72 hours) or until discharge of the patient 
from the ICU, if discharged within 3 days .

PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F. The measures for symptoms of PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F conditions (anxiety, depression, and PTSD) are found in the 
literature associated with spouses of adult ICU survivors.  
 Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression . Anxiety is defined as worry or fear that does not go away and 
interferes with daily activities such as job performance, school work, and relationships.[ADDRESS_551560] two weeks.23 
The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435438] (HAD) scale42 will be used to measure anxiety and depression  at 
four time points: study day 1 (immediately prio r to first intervention),  study day 3 , and by [CONTACT_435458] 30 and study day 90. The HADs is  easy to administer and has been successfully 
used to measure symptoms of anxiety (7 questions) and depression (7 questions) in the general 
population and in family members of ICU pati ents.4 Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) 
range from 0 to 21 with scores categorized as follows: normal 0 –7, mild 8 –10, moderate 11 –14, and 
severe 15 –21. Although HADs was not designed to be a clinically diagnostic tool,  in the event anxiety 
or depression subscales fall within the severe score range (15 -21), the participant will be provided with a 
copy of their results and encouraged to follow up with their primary care provider for clinical 
evaluation.  
 Symptoms of PTSD.  Symptoms of PTSD will be quantified at four time points: study day 1, study day 
3, and by [CONTACT_435459] [ADDRESS_551561] of Event Scale ( IES), 
which  is the most commonly used instrument to measure symptoms of PTSD in PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F research.[ADDRESS_551562] range of traumatic events.39 
The IES is not a tool for diagnosing PTSD, but instead detects  symptoms indicating a risk of PTSD. 
Each of the 15 items is scored on a 6 -point scale rated from 0 to 5; so that the total score can range from 
[ADDRESS_551563] -traumatic stress symptoms . In the event the total IES 
score is > 30, indicating a high risk of PTSD, the participant will be provided with a copy of their results 
and encouraged to follow up with their primary care provider for clinical evaluation.  
Stress. Symptoms of s tress will be quantified at four  time points: study day 1 (immediately prior to f irst 
intervention) , study day 3 , and by [CONTACT_435459] 30 and study day 90, using Cohen’s

 Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), which is a 10 -item measure with good psychometric properties that includes 
questions on how often in the previous month people view their lives as stressful and their ability to cope with 
stress. Response options range from never (0) to very often (4), with total scores on the scale ranging from 0 to 
40. 
Sleep/Rest . The gold stan dard for accurate sleep analysis is full polysomnography (PSG), but full PSG is not 
feasible. A wrist actiwatch (Actiwatch  Spectrum, Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770], Bend, OR) will be placed on the 
participant  during study enrollment  to measure activity and amb ient li ght levels  over a 3 -day period (72 hours).  
The actiwatch  is a small, lightweight, limb -worn activity -monitoring  device. Actigraphy is based on sleep 
algorithms . 
Behavior Function. The NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery44 testing will be used to measure behavioral function  at 
four time points: study day 1 (immediately prior to first intervention), study day [ADDRESS_551564] set of measures that can 
be used as a “common currency” across diverse study designs and settings. By [CONTACT_435460], the NIH Toolbox monitors neurological and behavioral function over time, and measures the domain 
constructs across developmental stages. This facilitates the study of functional changes across the lifespan, 
including evaluating intervention and treatm ent effectiveness. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_435439] [ADDRESS_551565] the development of PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F will be 
collected during admission to the study including age, race, e thnicity, sex , history of PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F conditions, level of 
education, and distance of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435437].  
Data Management. Data will  be downloaded into  research electronic data capture (REDCap ), a secure web 
application database, which will be accessed by a secure USF web connection with authentication and data 
logging . A unique identifier will be assigned to each participant by [CONTACT_3433] e PI [INVESTIGATOR_435440] . The data files will be backed up daily during the data entry  process and once a 
week during oth er tim es by [CONTACT_978] . All data files will be h oused on the university server, which is backed up 
every [ADDRESS_551566]

Data Analysis  
The defining parameter for feasibility is a minimum of two days participation in the study.  Descriptive statistics 
will be reported as means +/ - standard deviation for continuous variables and as frequencies and percentages for 
categorical v ariables.  We will pe rform  repeated measures models in order to compare symptoms of PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] -F 
conditions in the intervention and control groups. Specifically, the repeated outcome variables (symptoms of 
anxiety, depression, & PTSD) will be modeled using genera lized linear mixed effects models to account for

Sources of Materials . Data will be obtained from the participant ’s verbal feedback, wrist actigraphy, and health 
assessment instruments. Data will includ e age, race, ethnicity, sex , marital status, history of PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599] c onditions, 
level of education,  distance of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435437], Perceived Stress Scores, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435445], Impact 
Event Scores , and NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery Score . Each participant  will be assigned an  arbitrary study 
identification number  to conceal their identity , and no individually identifiable private information will be 
entered into the  study data base.  
 
Potential Risks . The risks of participation in the study are minimal. Risks include skin irritation from  the 
actiwatch, as well as apprehension  with the  Perceived Stress Scale, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620], 
Impact Event Scale , and NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery  health assessments.  
 
There is no alternative therapy. However, participant s may elect not to participate and may withdraw from  the 
study at any time without affecting the care they or the patient receive s. 
 
Protections Against Risk . The SĀF-T intervention will be administered in the privacy of the ICU’s 
consultation room to avoid interfere nce with critical care procedures  for the patient . At al l times,  we will place 
the patien t’s need for medical treatment, and avoidance  with interference with treatment, foremost.  
 
The information obtained will be kept strictly confidential, prote cting the identity of participant s in all  reports or 
publications that may result fro m this research. Each participant  will be assigned an arbitrary code  number to 
conceal their identity on all research data , and all research data will be maintained in locked file  cabinets under 
the direct supervision of the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_435446] . 
 
To ensure confidentiality, each participant will be assigned an arbitrary study identification number to conceal 
his or her  identity on all  research data. All hard copy research material (i.e., consent forms)  will be maintained

Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Participant s and Others  
Participant s in the intervention group may ben efit from this study if PI[INVESTIGATOR_435447] SĀF-T intervention. 
The results of this study holds promise to translate new knowledge into clinical decision -making about the 
management of critically ill patient’s family members  and ultimately improv e both family and patient 
outcomes.  
 
Inclusion of Women, Minorities,  and Children  
Inclusion of Women . TGH is a diverse clinical setting. Based on the patient characteristics of the study 
population in our  current study, females make up approximately 48% of  the population (about 3% less than the 
proportion of  women in Hillsborough County, FL, or the entire TGH hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63840]). Our experiences 
during previous critical care studies show that  recruitment of females is similar to that in the admission 
popul ation. Therefore, it is anticipated that the  participant s selected for this study will be representative in 
gender of the population of patients in the TGH ICUs.  All women meeting inclusion criteria will be recruited. 
We will review the enrollment of women  at our bi -week ly data and safety  meetings to ensure that we are 
meeting our target enrollment.  
 
Inclusion of Minorities . TGH is also an ethnically and racially diverse clinical setting. Based on admission 
characteristics of  the study population in Table 3, minorities make up approximately 26% of the population. We 
expect that  recruitment of minorities will also mirror these demographics. Our experiences during previous 
critical care  studies show that recruitment of minorities is similar to that in the adm ission population. It is 
anticipated that  the participant s selected for this study will be representative in ethnic background and race of 
the population of  patients in the TGH ICUs. We intend to recruit minorities consistent with our accessible 
population. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_435448]. All  patients 
meeting inclusion criteria will be recruited. We will review the enrollment of racial and ethnic  minorities at our 
bi-week ly data and safety  review  meetings to ensure that we are meeting our target enrollment.  
 
Inclusion of Children . Children less than 18 years of age will not be included in  this study, because PI[INVESTIGATOR_435449] .  
 
Publication and Presentation Plans:  
The design  and method s of this feasibility study will be presented in a poster for Sigma Theta Tau International 
Honor Society for Nursing, Delta Beta Chapter -at-Large’s Research Day.  The results of this study are expected 
to add knew knowledge on the feasibility and practicali ty of providing interventions for family members of 
critically ill patients, during the early ICU admission period, as well as the feasibility of longitudinal follow -up 
measures with family members post hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435450] a manuscr ipt for publication.

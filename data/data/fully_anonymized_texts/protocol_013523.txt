 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 3 of 148 Methodology:  
This was a Phase 3, open -label extension, 12 -month, multicenter study, with an option for up to 
an additional 36 months, to supplement the Phase 3 Fontan Udenafil Exercise Longitudinal 
Assessment Trial (FUEL study)  by [CONTACT_1541] a m ore robust safety and sid e-effect profile of the 
use of udenafil in adolescents with Fontan physiology. An attempt was made to recruit all 
participants who completed the FUEL study (approximately 400 adolescents). If recruitment from 
the FUEL study was les s than 300  subjects, addi tional adolescents with Fontan physiology (De 
Novo subjects) were identified through the review of clinical data records at each participating 
site until the minimum of [ADDRESS_935178] study visit by [CONTACT_689470]. Screening and identification of potential subjects 
continued until enrollment was complete.  
Subjects who agreed to participate had baseline testing performed to determine el igibility with 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. For subjects who participated in the FUEL study and continued on to 
this extension study , safety laboratory results from FUEL were accepted as meeting the inclusion 
criteria for FUEL Ext ension. For De Novo  subje cts, the baseline visit consisted of [ADDRESS_935179] dose of study drug was administered at the clinic (Visit 1). Approximately 
2 hours (±30  minutes) post dosing, resting heart rate and blood pressure were measured, and the 
subject performed a self -limited 6 -minute walk. A repeat heart rate and blood pressure were 
measured immediately following and approximately 2 hours (±30 minutes) following the 6 -
minute walk. Subjects who had a drop in systolic blood pressure >[ADDRESS_935180]-6-minute wa lk measurement, or had a drop in systolic blood pressure below the 5th 
percentile for age, were excluded from receiving any further study drug. Continuing subjects were 
dispensed their initial supply of study medication and instruc ted to take 1 tablet oral ly BID.

and [ADDRESS_935181] AEs.  
In-clinic study visits included assessments of safety (AEs, concomitant medication use, vital 
signs, and clinical safety laboratory evaluations), effi cacy (exercise testing, e chocardiogram, 
EndoPAT®, brain natriuretic peptide, and quality of life measurements), and pharmacokinetics.  
The duration of study drug dosing was [ADDRESS_935182]’s primary cardiologist

Criteria for evaluation  at interim analysis : 
Efficacy  endpoints : 
• Change in maximal VO 2 from baseline to Week  52 
• Change in VO 2 at ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) from baseline to Week 52 
• Change in ventilatory equivalents of carbon dioxide (VE/VCO 2) at peak exercise  from 
baseline to Week 52  
• Change in VE/VCO 2 at VAT  from baseline to Week 52  
• Change in minute v entilation at peak exercise  
• Change in work rate at peak exercise  from baseline to Week 52  
• Change in work rate at VAT  from baseline to Week 52  
• Change in myocardial performance index (MPI) from baseline to Week 52  
Safety:  
Adverse events, vital signs ( blood p ressure and heart rate), and concomitant medication use.  
Statistical methods at interim analysis:  
The Safety population included all subjects who took at least 1 dose of study drug. The Efficacy 
population included all enrolled subjects who had bas eline a nd Week 52 exercise capacity data for 
which site -based data quality assurance process was complete at data cut -off.  
Three treatment groups were defined:  
• Udenafil -Udenafil, which included subjects who received udenafil in the FUEL and 
FUEL Extension studie s 
• Placebo -Udenafil, which included subjects who received placebo in the FUEL study and 
udenafil in FUEL Extension  
• De Novo: Subjects who did not participate in the FUEL study and received udenafil in 
FUEL Extension  
For efficacy and safety s ummaries, the Pl acebo -Udenafil and De Novo groups were combined 
(denoted as Placebo/De Novo -Udenafil).  
All summaries were descriptive. Descriptive statistics for categorical endpoints included the 
number and percent of subjects in each treatment group and category. Quanti tative endpoints were 
summarized for each treatment group with the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum value, 
and maximum value. Missing data were not imputed.  
Baseline was defined as the last measurement before receipt of udenafil in  FUEL Extension.  For 
the Udenafil -Udenafil group, change to Week 52 of FUEL Extension measures change in exercise 
capacity between 26 weeks and 78 weeks of udenafil treatment. This change represents 
persistence of initial effectiveness beyond 26 weeks. For  the Placebo -Udenafil and De Novo 
groups, change to Week 52 of FUEL Extension measures change in exercise capacity from pre -
udenafil to following 52  weeks of udenafil treatment.

Statistical methods (continued):  
For each efficacy endpoint, descriptive st atistics were su mmarized for baseline, Week 52, and 
Week  52 change from baseline. A 2 -sided, 95% confidence interval was calculated for change 
from baseline for each group.  
Safety analyses were descriptive with no formal hypothesis testing. All AEs were cl assified by [CONTACT_689472]. Subject incidence of all treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and TEAEs that are 
treatment -related, serious, serious treatment -related , and any TEAE l eading to study 
discontinuation were tabulated. Number (%) of subjects who were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had a cardiac 
transplant, or died were tabulated.  
Incidence of potentially clinically significant changes from pre dose values in blood pressure a nd 
heart rate we re tabulated at i) post first study dose but before the self -limited 6 -minute walk, ii) 
after the 6 -minute walk, and iii) at any time after dosing.  
SUMMARY – CONCLUSIONS  
EFFICACY RESULTS:  
For the Udenafil -Udenafil group, change to Week 52 of FUEL Extensio n measures change in 
exercise capacity between 26 weeks and 78 weeks of udenafil treatment. This change represents 
persistence of initial effectiveness beyond 26 weeks. For the Placebo/De Novo -Udenafil group, 
change to Week 52 of FUEL Ex tension measures ch ange in exercise capacity from pre -udenafil to 
after 52 weeks of udenafil treatment.  
In the Placebo/De Novo -Udenafil group, mean exercise capacity and myocardial performance 
improved between pre -udenafil and after 52 weeks of udenafil tr eatment:  
• Mean incre ase at peak exercise effort in VO 2 (58.00 mL/min), work rate (5.78 watts), and 
minute ventilation (2.41 L/min). When VO [ADDRESS_935185]’s body 
weight, a mean decrease was observed ( -0.93 mL/kg/min; 95% CI: -1.7 to -0.2 
mL/kg/min).  
• Mean in crease in VO 2 at VAT of 12.90 mL/min (95% confidence interval [CI]: -23.1 to 
48.9 mL/min). When standardized by [CONTACT_689473]’s body weight, a mean decrease was 
observed ( -0.93 mL/kg/min; 95% CI: -1.5 to -0.4 mL/kg/min).  
• Mean decrease in VE/VCO 2 at VAT of -0.77 (95% CI: -1.4 to -0.2). 
• Mean increase in work rate at VAT of 0.58 watts (95% CI: -2.6 to 3.7 watts).  
• Mean decrease in MPI [CONTACT_4007] -0.04 (95% CI: -0.1 to 0.0).  
In the Udenafil -Udenafil group, mean exercise capacity was improved while myocardial 
performance did not deteriorate between 26 weeks and 78  weeks of udenafil treatment:  
• Mean increase at peak exercise effort in VO 2 (38.00 mL/min), work rate (2.99 watts), and 
minute ventilation (2.56 L/min). When VO [ADDRESS_935186]’s body 
weight, a me an decrease was observed ( -1.45 mL/kg/min; 95% CI: -2.3 to -0.6 
mL/kg/min).  
• Mean increase in VO 2 at VAT of 6.57 mL/min ( 95% CI: -47.9 to 61.0 mL/min). When 
standardized by [CONTACT_6992]’s body weight, a mean decrease was observed  
(-1.25 mL/kg/min; 95% CI: -2.1 to -0.4 mL/kg/min).  
• Mean decrease in VE/VCO 2 at VAT of -0.66 (95% CI: -1.6 to 0.3).  
• Mean increase in work rate at VA T of 0.26 watts (95% CI: -5.1 to 5.6 watts).  
• Negligible mean decrease in MPI [CONTACT_4007] -0.0 (95% CI: 0.0 to 0.0).

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 148 SAFETY RESULTS:  
No clinica lly important differences were observed in the safety profile between subjects who had 
previously received treatment with udenafil and those who were naïve to udenafil treatment prior to 
participating in this study.  
Similar percentages of subjec ts in the Udenafil -Udenafil and Placebo/De Novo -Udenafil groups 
reported TEAEs (77.3% and 80.3%, respectively), drug -related TEAEs (64.1% and 67.6%, 
respectively), TEAEs of Grade ≥3 (3.9% and 7.5%, respectively), serious TEAEs (10.9% and 13.9%, 
respectivel y), drug -related serious TEAEs (3.9% and 5.8%, respectively), and TEAEs resulting in 
temporary or permanent discontinuation of study drug (15.6% and 12.7%, respectively).  
The most common TEAEs reported included headache (35.2%), flushing (17.2%), dizziness  (11.7%), 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (10.2%), and nausea (10.2%) in the Udenafil -Udenafil group and 
headache (40.5%), flushing (15.6%), nasopharyngitis (12.7%), and dizziness (12.7%) in the 
Placebo/De Novo -Udenafil group. Most TEAEs were mild or mod erate in i ntensity; similar 
percentages of subjects in the Udenafil -Udenafil (5 subjects; 3.9%) and Placebo/De Novo -Udenafil 
(13 subjects; 7.5%) groups experienced a severe TEAE.  
There was no clinically important difference in the TEAE profile among males  and femal es; the 
limited number of non -Caucasian subjects and Hispanic or Latino/Latina subjects precluded 
meaningful comparisons between race and ethnicities within treatment groups.  
No subject died during the study. At least 1 serious TEAE was reported by 14 (10. 9%) subjects in the 
Udenafil -Udenafil group and 24 (13.9%) subjects in the Placebo/De Novo -Udenafil group. Among 
the serious TEAEs reported, cardiac failure was reported by 4 subjects in the Placebo/De Novo 
Udenafil group, transient ischaemic att ack was re ported by 2 subjects in the Placebo/De Novo 
Udenafil group and [ADDRESS_935187] in the Udenafil -Udenafil group, abdominal pain and appendicitis were 
reported by 2  subjects each in the Udenafil -Udenafil group, protein -losing gastroenteropathy, 
gastroente ritis, and  syncope were reported by 2 subjects each in the Placebo/De Novo Udenafil group, 
and anaemia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and vomiting were reported by 
[ADDRESS_935188] each in the Udenafil -Udenafil and Placebo/De Novo Udenafi l groups. All other serious 
TEAEs were reported by [CONTACT_23818] a single subject in either treatment group. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689425] 14  (10.9%) subjects in the Udenafil -Udenafil group and for 24 (13.9%) subjects in the 
Placebo/De  Novo Udenafil grou p. No tran splants were reported.  
At least 1 TEAE leading to temporary or permanent discontinuation of study drug was reported by 
20 (15.6%) subjects in the Udenafil -Udenafil group and 22 (12.7%) subjects in the 
Placebo/De  Novo -Udenafil group. The most comm on types o f TEAEs that led to temporary or 
permanent discontinuation of study drug were associated with nervous system disorders including 
headache (2 Udenafil -Udenafil, 4 Placebo/De Novo -Udenafil), migraine (2 Udenafil -Udenafil, 
2 Placebo/De Novo -Udenafil ), and diz ziness (1 Udenafil -Udenafil, 2 Placebo/De Novo -Udenafil).  
Dizziness was the most commonly reported TEAE of special interest (11.7% Udenafil -Udenafil and 
12.7% Placebo/De Novo -Udenafil). None of the events of dizziness was serious, all were consid ered 
mild or moderate in intensity and most required no change in study drug. The other TEAEs of interest 
including syncope, presyncope, and hypotension occurred in <4% of subjects in either treatment 
group.  
No clinically important findings were observed i n the eval uations of vital signs.  
CONCLUSION:  
Improvement in exercise capacity was observed in those who were previously naïve to udenafil 
therapy, and there was persistence of effect on exercise capacity for those who were previously 
treated with udenafil. Udenafi l administered orally at 87.5 mg BID for 52 weeks was safe and well 
tolerated in this study.

Udenafil  Study PHN -Udenafil -02 Clinical Study Report  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 148 7 Introduction  
The overall aim of the Fontan Udenafil Exerci se Longitudinal Assessment (FUEL) trial was 
to evalua te the efficacy and safety of udenafil as a therapeu tic option for those born with 
single ventricle heart disease who have undergone Fontan palliation. This study was 
conducted in coordination with the P HN, a consortium of congenital heart centers under th e 
leadership of the NHLBI . At present, medical thera py for these patients is extrapolated from 
experience with adult -onset systolic heart failure, a condition distinct from the heart failure 
state associ ated with the Fontan circulation. The development of a medication specific to the 
physiology following Fo ntan palliation would represent a major therapeutic advancement in 
the field, as there are currently no approved pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_689430].  
The Fontan operation is a palliative procedure for children born with a rare group of 
congenital heart defects characterized by a single functional ventricle ( Fontan  1971 ; 
Kreutzer  1973 ). This operation, which creates a total cavopulmonary connection, s eparates 
the systemic and pulmonary circulations, an d reduces the hypoxemia and ventricu lar volume 
overload characteristic of single ventricle heart disease. After the Fontan, the single cardiac 
ventricle is surgically assigned to pump blood only to the sy stemic circulation. Flow through 
the pulmonary circu lation, now without the assistance o f a pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_412901], is dependent 
on the gradient between central venous pressure (CVP) and atrial pressure, and on the 
maintenance of low pulmonary vascular resistance  (PVR) . The introduction of the Fontan 
operation has  significantly improved the morbidit y and mortality burden of single ventricle 
heart disease through childhood, but has also created a unique population with a substantial 
need for ongoing cardiac care an d intervention, and a limited life expectancy. Altho ugh the 
Fontan operation is initiall y well tolerated, the unique characteristics of the total 
cavopulmonary connection lead to progressive cardiovascular dysfunction over time.  
Exercise performance is a k ey metric of cardiovascular health for a variety of congenital and 
acquired forms of hea rt disease. For those who have undergone Fontan palliation, this 
relationship may hold particular importance  (Diller  2005 ; Diller  2010 ; Fernandes  2011; 
Cunningham  2017 ). The decline in exercise capacity that typi[INVESTIGATOR_689431], an increase in the need for hospit alization, and an increase  in the prevalence of 
both heart transplantation and mortality. The limitations in exercise capacity in the Fontan 
circulation are related to the absence of a sub -pulmonary ventr icle. Without a pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_689432] d through the lungs and ba ck to the heart, the ability to increase 
cardiac output is dependent on low PVR  and an elevation in CVP. In a 2 -ventricle circulation, 
Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd  5.3 Clinical Study Reports and Related Information  
Udenafil  Study PHN -Udenafil -02 Clinical Study Report  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 148 an increase in right -heart pressure to near ly 50 mmHg is key to reaching the increase in 
cardia c output of 4 -fold or grea ter seen at peak exercise ( Stickland  2006 ; Argiento  2010 ). In a 
single ventricle circulation, however, CVP  cannot reach a pressure near  that which can be 
achieved by a typi[INVESTIGATOR_689433]. In this setting, the ability to augment cardiac output is 
limited and the role of PVR  during exercise is magnified  (Goldberg  2013 ; Navaratnam  2016 ; 
Egbe  2017 ). By [CONTACT_689481] , one ca n decongest the venous system at baseline and allow 
for an improvement in the ability to increase flow through the pulmonary vasculature during 
exercise ( Gewillig  2010 ; Goldstein  2010 ; La Gerche  2010 ). 
Udenafil is a selective, long -acting phos phodiesterase type 5 (PDE -5) inhibitor that has 
unique characteristics within the class and has demonstrated effectiveness as a pulmonary 
vasodilator  in the treatment of patients with pulmonary hyperte nsion  (Chang  SA 2019 ; 
Chang  H-J 2019 ). Given the need for a medication specific to those with a total 
cavopulmonary connection, Mezzi on Pharma Co. Ltd, in partnersh ip with the PHN, has 
developed udenafil as a potenti al therapeutic option for those who have undergone the Fontan 
procedure. At present, udenafil is the only pharmacotherapy to have undergone 
pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis thr ough a Phase  1/2 dose -finding s tudy in this population. 
This study demonstrated tha t a dose of 87.5 mg twice daily (BID) provided the highest 
maximal plasma concentration with an acceptable drug tolerability and a clinical 
improvement in ventricular perfor mance.  
After completion of the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_935226] of 26 weeks of treatment with 
udenafil (87.5  mg, BID) on exercise capacity in adolescents with Fontan physiology.  
The secondary objectives of this study o f adolescents with Fontan physiology were to:  
• Determine the effect of 26 weeks of treatment with udenafil on echocardiographic 
indices of systolic and diastolic ventricular performance.  
• Determine the effe ct of 26 weeks of treatment with udenafil on endothe lial function.  
• Evaluate the effect of 26 weeks of treatment with udenafil on serum brain natriuretic 
peptide (BNP) level, a biomarker of heart failure.  
• Evaluate the safety of udenafil when given over a 26-week time period.  
• Determine if 26 weeks’ treatment with udenafil alter s functional health status.  
• Establish a collection of genetic material to identify genetic determinants of exercise 
capacity and res ponse to udenafil and for unspecified future studies.  
• Determine the prevalence and severity of complicati ons, including protein -losing 
enteropathy , plastic bronchitis, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], cardiac transplantation and death in 
adolescents who receive d udenafil . 
• Explore the impact of udenafil on atrial and ventri cular premature beats and 
arrhythmia burden.  
[ADDRESS_935227] igational Plan  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan Description  
This was a Phase  3 randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, 26 -week, multicenter 
study of  the effects of udenafil versus placebo in adolescent s with Fontan physiology. The 
target sample size was  400 adolescents (200 per treatment group).  
At PHN sites, potential subjects were identified through a screening chart review. Subjects 
who met initia l study eligibility criteria, were receiving primary cardiac care at the PHN site, 
and were geographicall y local to the PHN site were approached regarding participation. In 
Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd  5.3 Clinical Study Reports and Related Information

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 148 addition, auxiliary sites in the [LOCATION_002] and Korea were recruited at the begi nning of the 
study to augment the number of potential  subjects.  
Subjects who agreed to participate had ba seline testing performed to determine eligibility 
with inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects performed an exercise test to maximal effort to be 
eligib le for randomization and study drug initiation. A sub ject who was unable to achieve a 
maximal effort (res pi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] [RER] ≥1.10) on exercise testing but who 
otherwise qualified for inclusion, was offered the opportunity to repeat the test with in 
2 weeks of time of consent. Subjects with maximal minute oxygen consumption ( VO 2) <50% 
of predicted fo r age and gender , based on their most recent prior clinical exercise test , were 
excluded from the study.  
Eligible subjects were stratified by [CONTACT_689482] (single left vs single right or 
mixed) and randomly assigned by a web -based system at the d ata coordinating center (DCC) 
to 1 of 2 treatment groups: orally administered udenafil (87.5  mg BID) or matching placebo 
BID. The first dose of randomi zed study drug was administered at the clinic (Visit  1, 
baseline).  
Approximately 2 hours (±  30 minutes) post dosing, resting heart rate and blood pressure were 
measured, and the subject performed a self -limited 6 -minute walk. A repeat heart rate and 
blood  pressure were measured immediately following and app roximately 2 hours 
(± 30 minutes) following the [ADDRESS_935228] s who had a drop in systolic blood 
pressure >[ADDRESS_935229] -6-minute walk measurement, or had a drop in 
systolic blood pressure below the 5th percentile for age, were excl uded from receiving any 
further study drug. Continui ng subjects were di spensed their initial supply of study 
medication and instructed to take 1  tablet orally BID.  
Subjects returned to the clinic at Week 26  (study completion/early termination). In additio n to 
clinic visits, study coordinators contact[CONTACT_689483] h subject by [CONTACT_689484] (AEs). Subjects were also contact[CONTACT_689485]  1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 13, 17, and [ADDRESS_935230] ications.  
In-clinic study visits included assessmen ts of safety (AEs, concomitant medication use, vital 
signs, and clinical safety laboratory evaluations), efficacy (exercise testing, echocardiogram, 
EndoPAT®, BNP, and quality of life measurements), and P K. 
Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd  5.[ADDRESS_935231]’s primary cardiologist was notified, and the study drug was stopped. All 
subjects were invited to participate in an open -label, [ADDRESS_935232] declining pa rticipation in the extension study was to be followed for 
90 days at Weeks 30, 34, and 39 for any additional AEs.  
Subjects were given the opportunity to participate in the heart rhythm -monitoring subset o f 
FUEL until a total of 25% of all randomized subjec ts had been include d. Heart rhythm 
monitoring included a 7 -day baseline monitor and a 3 -day steady state monitor, as described

study drug effects. Because there currently are no approved treatments for Fontan physiol ogy, 
the use of a placebo control was consid ered eth ical.  
The dosage (87 .5 mg) and frequency of administration (BID) of the study drug were 
determined by [CONTACT_689486]-escalation study  of udenafil in 
adolescents with Fontan pa lliation ( PHN -Udenafil -01).  
Prior to random ization,  eligible subjec ts were stratified by [CONTACT_689487] (single left 
vs single right or mixed) . The rationale for ventricular stratification was based on the results 
of previous PHN cross -sectional s tudies that demonstrated a weak but signific ant diff erence 
in certain resting echocardiographic and exercise results based on morphology ( Paridon  2008 ; 
Anderson  2008 ). In addition, preliminary data on PDE -5 inhibito rs suggested a difference in 
exercise performance ba sed on morphology ( Goldberg  2011 ).

administration of 175 mg/day  udenafil (87.5  mg BID) for 5 days improved ventricular 
performance as measured by [CONTACT_689498] (MPI). Thus, subjects 
in the current study took udenafil [ADDRESS_935243]  
Subjects were instructed to take the study drug twice a day. To minimize any potential diurnal 
and/or PK effect , the time of administration of the study drug at baseline and Wee k 26 was to 
match.  
9.4.6 Blinding  
The study drug and the placebo were identical in appearance to assure blinding  of study drug. 
The randomization assignment was seen only by [CONTACT_689499]/subject, study coordina tor, investigators, or personnel administer ing 
study procedures . The exercise testing laboratories and echocardiogram core laboratory were 
blinded  to group assignment and study visit. All remained blinded  as to treatment group 
assignment until after all study data were analyzed.  
In rare life -threat ening or emergency situations , when the identity of the study drug must 
have been known to the I nvestigator in order to provide appropriate medical treatment or if 
required to assure safety of study  participants , an emergency code break could have been 
requested from the site research pharmacist after full discussion with the PHN Center

• Medications or other substances that strongly inhibit C YP3A4 including , but not 
limited to , erythromycin, indinavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin, fluconazole, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, and nefazodone.  
• Medications or substances tha t strongly induce CYP3A4 including , but not limited to, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin , and St. John’s Wort.  
• Alpha blockers  
• Intravenous inotropic drugs  
• Bosentan  
• Ritonavir  
• Medication s with a drug interaction that were to  be avo ided: 
o Boceprevir  
o PDE -5 inhibitors including sildenaf il 
o Telaprevir  
o Vasodilator (organic nitrates) including isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide 
mononitrate , and nitroglycerin  
o Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators  
• Select antihypertensives including amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], angiotensin II receptor blockers, 
enalapril , and met oprolol were to  be used with caution, as small decreases in blood 
pressure occurred when udenafil was co -administered with these agents.  
Grapefruit juice was to  be limited or avoided throughout study  participation, as it may 
increase serum levels and/or t he toxicity of udenafil. In preparation for EndoPAT testing, 
subjects were required to abstain from caffeine and to have  fasted for [ADDRESS_935246] adherence to medication therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (Morisky  1986 ).

For those subjects who opted to participate, heart rhythm monitoring included a 7 -day

monitoring are described in Protocol PHN -Udenafil -02 (FUEL) Section 6.3.[ADDRESS_935263] range of diagnostic categories of 
heart disease .  
In studies of young adults with variable types of congenital heart disease, a maximal VO 2 of 
approximately 50 % of predicted for age and gender appears to be the threshold value for 
increased risk of heart failure and death (Diller  2005 ; Canter  2007 ; Giardini  2007 ; 
Diller  2010). For those with a Fontan circulation, the PHN Fon tan Cross -Sectional Study 
demonstrated a population maximal VO 2 of 66% of predicted normative values at the onset of 
adolescence while Giardini and colleagues have shown a predicted rate of decline of up to

Udenafil         Study PHN -Udenafil -02 Clinica l Study Report  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 148 2.6% per year. Taken together, these data suggest  that the population would fall below the  
50% threshold early in the third decade of life. An intervention capable of improving the 
baseline or slowing the slope of decline would therefore have important functional 
ramifications for long -term outcomes.   
While a good measure across heterogeneous f orms of heart disease, the use of maximal VO [ADDRESS_935264] challenges unique to the Fontan circulation. Due to the 
intrinsic limitations of pulmonary vasodilatory reserve, the Fontan circulati on’s ability to 
maintain adequate preload  to the systemic ventricle at higher levels of exercise is limited and 
can only be accomplished by [CONTACT_689503] . Under these circumstances, the ability 
to perform sub -maximal aerobic activity may be bette r preserved than maximal VO 2. The 
data fr om the PHN Fontan Cross -Sectional Study as well as additional studies support this 
notion  (Paridon  2008 ; d'Udekem  2009 ; Goldstein  2010). Using  Paridon  2008  as an example , 
VO 2 at ventilatory an aerobic threshold ( V AT) was significantly better preserved at 78% of 
predicted compared to a maximal VO 2 at 66% of predicted .  
The VO [ADDRESS_935265] significant abnormalities in 
both ventricular systolic and diastolic function ( Sano  1989 ; Frommelt  1991 ; Akagi  1993 ; 
Cheung  2000 ; Kaneko  2012 ). Animal studies have suggested that PDE -[ADDRESS_935266] suggested an improvement in ventricular 
performance in response to treatment  (Goldberg  2012 ; Tunks  2014 ; Van De Bruaene  2014 ; 
Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd  5.3 Clinical Study Reports and Related Information  
Udenafil         Study PHN -Udenafil -02 Clinica l Study Report  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 148 Goldberg  2017 ; Garcia  2018 ). Given the impor tance of ventricular performance in the 
long-term health of those with all forms of heart disease, an improvement in this aspect of 
physiology woul d be of significant value across the population. The  MPI [CONTACT_832] a measure of 
systolic and diastolic function that  indexes isovolumetric relaxation and contraction times to 
the ventricular ejection time; a smaller number suggests more efficient contraction and 
relaxation. An improvement in MPI [INVESTIGATOR_689440] t in this population, one with well 
documented abnormalit ies in systolic and diastolic function.  
Studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between endothelial function and exercise 
capacity, includin g recent data utilizing EndoPAT in the assessment of  endothelial function 
(Goldstein  2011 ; Goldstein  2016). Based on the known effect of PDE -5 inhibitors and the 
known endothelial dysfunction in the Fonta n population ( Mahle  2003 ; Inai 2004 ; Jin 2007 ; 
Binotto  2008 ), a measure of endothel ial function is a useful candidate marker for a potential 
pharmacodynamic effect.  The Framingham -modif ied RHI and raw RHI measures serve d as 
secondary out come measures of vascular function.  
Serum BNP is a useful biomarker in patients with heart failure fro m a variety of causes. A 
study of BNP levels in 510 patients after the Fontan procedure (median age 11 .4 years) 
performed through the PHN revealed mean BN P levels of 25  ± 48 pg/mL ( Atz 2011 ). Higher 
BNP was associated with several markers of suboptimal out comes albeit with weak 
associations but  may be a predictor of Fontan failure. In the p ilot study by [CONTACT_689504], those 
with a serum BNP level  >100 pg/mL had a more robust response to sildenafil 
(Goldberg  2011 ). Thus, BNP may be helpful in measuring a response  to medical intervention.  
The quality of life and functional status questionnaires  have been widely used in multi ple 
studies. The safety and PK measurements utilized were standard, widely used, and generally 
recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study population and study design.  
9.5.3 Primary Efficacy Var iable  
The primary efficacy variable was the change i n maximal VO 2 from baseline to Week 26

9.7 Statistical Methods Planned in the Protocol and Determination 
of Sample Size  
9.7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The statistical methods descr ibed below are summarized from  the final Statistical  Analysis 
Plan (SAP) , dated [ADDRESS_935268] data were  presented in data listings  that include d normal reference ranges 
when appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis P opulations  
Three analysis populations were defined:  
• Intent -to-treat (ITT)  population : The ITT population included all randomized subjects 
and was the primary population for efficacy analyses. Treatment as signments were 
analyzed according to the randomized treatment assignment.  
• Safety population : The Safety population included all  subjects who took at least 
1 dose of randomized study drug and was the primary population for safety analyses. 
If the wrong stud y drug was administered ( eg, subject was randomized to udenafil but 
received placebo), treatment assignment was analyzed accord ing to the actual study 
drug received.  
• Per Protocol population : The Per Protocol population included all subjects in the 
Safety population who met all entry criteria or, if criteri a were not met, were granted a 
waiver by [CONTACT_1034]. Subjects with major p rotocol deviations were excluded 
(including subjects who received the wrong study drug). The Per Protocol population 
was used for  sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoi nt.

Screening failures ( ie, subject s who were not randomized) were summarized by [CONTACT_689507]. The number and perce nt of subjects who 
were randomized, treated with ran domized study drug, prematurely discontinued, and 
completed the study were summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The number and percent of 
subjects were summarized by [CONTACT_689508] e discontinuation. 
For subjects who completed the st udy, the number of subjects who continued into the 
extension study were sum marized.  
The number and percent of enrolled subjects were summarized by [CONTACT_3885], and the number 
of subjects included in each a nalysis population were summarized by [CONTACT_39815] p. 
Major protocol deviations were identified prior to breaking the blind. D eviations could have 
included, but were not limited to, departure from inclusion/exclusion criteria, received the 
wrong study dru g, failure to perform the required assessments at sp ecified time points, and 
scheduling of visits not in accordance with specif ications.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic ( eg, age, gender , race) and baseline characteristics were summariz ed 
descriptively for the Safety and ITT populations,  for all subjects and for each treatment 
group.  Medical and surgical histor y/physical findings were classified by [CONTACT_689509] (MedDRA) . The 
number and percentage of subjects w ith abnormalities in medical and surgical histories in 
each system organ cl ass and preferred term  were summarized for all subjects and by

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Prima ry Efficacy Endpoint  
The treatment group difference for change in aerobic exercise performance (as measured by 
[CONTACT_70989] 2 at maximum e xercise effort [maximal VO 2]) from baseline to Week 26 was assessed 
with an analysis of covariance (ANCOV A) with fixed factors fo r ventricular morphology 
(single left versus single right or mixed) and treatment group with a continuous covariate of 
baseline maximal VO 2.

Each secondary efficacy en dpoint was summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].   
Treatment group differences for endpoints associated with the PedsQL and PCQLI were  to be  
assessed with Friedman’s test using ventricular morpholog y (single left versus single right or 
mixed) as the stratification factor. The treatment group difference for the qualitative estimate 
of atrioventricular valve insufficiency was to be assessed with  a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
test using ventricular morpholo gy (single left versus single right or mixed) as the  
stratification factor.  
The remaining secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed with the ANCOV A model with 
fixed factors for ventricular morphol ogy (single left versus single right or mixed) and 
treatme nt group with a covariate for the baseline value.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Subgroup Analyses  
Treatment group differences for the primary efficacy endpoint were  summarized descriptively 
for the following subpopulations  based on the following baseline characteristics : 
• Gender  (male,  female)  
• Race ( Asian, African  American, Caucasian, o ther) 
• Ethnicity ( Hispanic, non-Hispanic ) 
• Ventricular morphology ( single left, single  right , mixed)  
• Age at Fontan surgery ( <3 years  vs ≥3 years)

each subpopulation.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Missing Data  
The following imputation method was used for the primary analysis of the primary outcome:  
• Subjects who had died or dropped out of the study wit h unknown vital status were to 
be assigned a maximal VO 2 of zero at Week 26 . No subjects met this criterion.  
• Subjects who were known to be alive, but who discontinued from the study (and were 
missing maxi mal VO 2 at Week 26 ) were assigned the latest value a vailable.  
• Subjects who completed Week 26 , but were physically unable to reach maximum 
effort in cardiopulmonary exercise testing after 2  attempts, were assigned their 
baseline value (ie, zero change).  
Two additional analyses to assess the impact of missing  data were conducted as follows:  
• Subjects with missing maximal VO 2 at Visit 4 were assigned a maximal VO 2 of zero . 
• Subjects with missing  maximal VO 2 at Visit 4 were excluded from analysis (ie, 
observed ca ses analysis).  
Missing item scores for rating scales  were imputed according to published methodology for 
the scale. Otherwise, missing data were not estimated for secondary efficacy endpoi nts. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Evaluations  
Safety assessments were summarized for the S afety population. No formal hypothesis testing 
was performed.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_935269] dose was summarized descriptively for each treatment 
group. Percent compliance for the entire study was calculated as follows:  
Number ta blets missed  = (number returned – (2 × number of day s off study))  
Number tablets expected  = 2 × number of days on study  
Percent Compliance  = (1 - (number missed / number expected)) × 100.

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_935273], change from baseline to 
Week  26 (study completion) was summarized descriptively for each treatment group. Th e 
baseline value was defined as the last assessment on or before dosing at Visit  1. Second, the 
number and proportion of subjects with treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory values w ere 
tabulated and the subjects identified. Treatment -emergent abnormal lab oratory tests were 
those in which the baseline value  was within the laboratory normal reference range and the 
postbaseline  value was abnormal ( ie, met Grade III or Grade IV toxicity criteria from the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria). All laboratory values obtained 
after Visit  1 were in cluded in the analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Vital Signs  
Change from baseline (last vital sign value before the first dose of study drug at Visit  1) to 
each scheduled assessment was summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_689518]. Vital signs that were  potentially clinically significant were identified according 
to prespecified criteria (listed in the SAP) and summarized descript ively by [CONTACT_1570].  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_935274] dose of study drug or ongoing at study completion/discontinuation  were  
considered concomitant medications. Therefore,  medications that start ed before the study and 
continue d into the study were  counted as both prior and concomitant medications.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 148 9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size  
A sample size of 198  subjects per group would  provid e 90% power to detect a mean 
treatment group di fference in change from baseline to Week 26  in maximal VO 2 scores of 
10% (ie, an improvement of 2.8  mL/kg/min in the udenafil group compared to zero change in 
the control group, assuming a Type I error of  0.[ADDRESS_935275] deviation of 7.235 ). A 
difference  of 2.8 , equivalent to a 10% increase from a baseline of 28  mL/kg/min, represents 
approxi mately 0.[ADDRESS_935276] udy 
The original protocol, dated 09  March  2016,  was amended 3 times. A copy of the final study 
protocol (Protocol PHN -Udenafil -02, dated [ADDRESS_935277]  2017) is provided in Appendix  16.1.1 .  
Version 2 of the protocol (04  May 2016) included the following substantive modifications  to 
the original protocol:  
• Added a DSMB review of all data after t he first 50  subjects  had completed the study . 
• Added the opportunity for subjects to enroll in a heart rhythm -monitoring subset of 
the FUE L study . 
Version 3 of the protocol (30  May 2017) incl uded the following substantive modifications to 
Version 2 of the protocol:  
• Conversion of Visits  2 and  3 to telephone calls , removing vital sign measurements .  
Version  4 of the protocol ([ADDRESS_935278]  2017) i ncluded the following substantive modifications 
to Version  3 of the protocol:  
• Addition of inclusion criterion #4 , which required potential participants to be on 
anti-platelet or anticoagulant therapy . 
• Addition of exclusion criter ion #26 , which excluded pot ential participants if they had 
a history of clinical ly significant thromboembolic event .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Changes Between Protocol Finalization and Final Statistical 
Analysis Plan  
The SAP was finalized [ADDRESS_935279] would be conducted 
to identify dif ferential treatment effects. Tests for treatment by s ubpopulation were not 
performed due to the low power of the tests.  
The protocol also stated that treatment group differences would be asses sed within 
subpopulations if the interaction p -value was <0.10. These tests were not performed due to 
their potential ly low power and bias due to lack of randomization within each subpopulation.  
Minor clarifications were made to imputations for missing val ues. 
Difference s between the SAP and analyses  presented in the clinical study report include:  
• Presentation of the fo llowing for exercise capacity:  
o Percent predicted maximal VO 2 
o Heart rate at peak exercise  
• Additional specific variables related to ventricular performance were  summarized in 
the statistical tables.  
• Friedm an’s test using ventricular morphology (single left v ersus single right or mixed) 
as the stratification factor was not used to assess treatment group differences for 
endpoints associa ted with the PedsQL and PCQLI. Differences were assessed using 
the same A NCOV A model as the other secondary endpoints.  
• The qua litative estimate of atrioventricular valve insufficiency was not assessed.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Changes Between Fina lization of Statistical Analysis Plan 
and Blind Break  
Key changes to statistical analyses between SAP finalization on 23 June 2016  and blind break 
on 19  July 2019 are described below.  
Treatment group dif ferences for the primary efficacy endpoint were  summa rized descriptively 
for subjects on afterload reducing agents in the study versus  subjects who were not on 
afterload reducing agen ts in the study.  
Analyses by [CONTACT_689519] v ersion 3, which replaced in -person 
Visits 2 and 3 (at  Weeks 2 and 13, respectively) by [CONTACT_21646], and to remove collection 
of vital sign measurements at those time points.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Chang es After Blind Break  
Maximal VO 2 and VO 2 at V AT were summarized with unit s of mL/min in addition to the 
protocol -specified uni ts of mL/kg/min. This was done since unchanged VO 2 in the presence 
of weight gain would cause VO 2 to appear to decrease when summa rized as mL/kg/min . 
Waterfall plots and cumulative distribution plots wer e generated for change from baseline to 
Week  26 in maximal VO 2 and VO 2 at V AT (mL/min and mL/mg/min).  
Percent change from baseline was calculated for maximal VO 2 and VO 2 at V AT as the 
geometric mean ratio of the Week 26 minus baseline logarithm transformed  exercise data.  
An additional imputation method for m issing data was included for exercise variables. When 
the Week 26 value was missing, the mean of non -missing Week 26  values (ignoring treatment 
group) was imputed.  
For VO [ADDRESS_935280] Week 26 VO 2 at V AT 
from W eek 26 maximal VO 2. The predicted value from the model was used to impute VO 2 at 
V AT when maximal VO 2 was available;  when maximal VO [ADDRESS_935281] s with non -missing valu es was imputed .

udenafil on exercise c apacity in adolescents with Fontan physiology, with a primary outc ome 
of change in maximal VO 2 from baseline to  Week 26 . The udenafil group had a mean 
increase from baseline to Week 26 in maximal VO 2 compared to a mean decrease in  the 
placebo group , and  the primary analysis  identified a statistical trend fo r the treatmen t 
difference (p=0.0 71). Importantly , all efficacy endpoints measured at VAT indicated greater 
exercise capacity in the udenafil group than the placebo group at Week  26 (p≤0.05).   
After an initial summary of the protocol -specified primary endpoint (maximal VO 2), this 
summary of efficacy will focus on measures of exercise capacity at V AT. In addition, 
maximal VO 2 and VO 2 at V AT were summarized with units of mL/min in ad dition to the 
protocol -specified units of mL/kg/min. As each participant’s VO 2 at Week 26 is compared to 
their baseline, the natural fluctuations in weight over 6 months would add variability and 
could be a  source of bias for individual subjects  and for th e study population as a whole.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overview of Results for VO 2 at V AT and Maximal VO 2 
For the protocol -specified primary endpoint, the udenafil group had a mean increase from 
baseline to Week 26 in maximal VO 2 (44.40  mL/min) compared to a mean decrease in the 
placebo group ( -3.65 mL/min). The least squares mean treatment group difference for change 
from baseline to Week 26 in maximal VO 2 was 41.04  mL/min (p=0.071). When standardized 
by [CONTACT_6992]’s body weight , the least squares mean treatment group differenc e was 
0.64 mL/kg/min (p=0.092). Results were consistent across method s of imputation for missing 
data and analysis population s (Table 12). 
For VO 2 at V AT, the udenafil group had a mean increase from baseline to Wee k 26 in VO 2 at 
V AT (29.65 mL/min ) as compared to a mean decrease in  the placebo group ( -8.01 mL/min). 
The least squares mean treatment group difference for change from baseline to Week 26 in 
VO 2 at V AT was 41.58  mL/min (p=0.0 23). When standardized by [CONTACT_6992]’s body weight, 
Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd  5.[ADDRESS_935291] squares mean treatment group difference was 0.78 mL/kg/min (p=0.0 12). Results 
were consistent across m ethod s of imputation for missing data and analysis population s 
(Table 12).

11.4.2  Statistical/Analytical Issues  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adjustments for Covariates  
The primary efficacy endpoint (aerobic exercise performance)  and some of the secondary 
efficacy endpoints were analyzed with an  ANCOVA model with fixed factors for ventricular 
morphology and treatment groups with a covariate of the relevant baseline value . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data  
The following imputati on method was used for the primary analysis of  the primary outcome:  
• Subjects who died or dropped out of the study with unknown vital status were to be 
assigned a maximal VO [ADDRESS_935308] met this criterion.  
• Subjects who were known to be alive, but who discontinued from the study (an d were 
missing maximal VO 2 at Week 26 ) were assigned the latest value available . 
Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd  5.3 Clinical Study Reports and Related Information  
Udenafil         Study PHN -Udenafil -02 Clinica l Study Report  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 83 of 148 • Subjects who completed Week 26 but  were physica lly unable to reach max imum  
effort in cardiopulmonary exercise testing after 2 att empts , were assigned their 
baseline value ( ie, zero change ). 
Two additional sensitivity analyses  to assess the impact of missing data were conducted as 
follows:  
• Subjects with missing maximal VO 2 at Week 26  were assigned a maximal VO 2 of 
zero.  
• Subjects wit h missing maximal VO 2 at Week 26  were excluded  from analysis  (ie, 
observed cases analysis) . 
An additional imputation method for missing data was included for exercise variables. When 
the Week 26 value was missing, the mean of non -missing Week 26 values (ignoring treatment 
group) was imputed.  
For VO [ADDRESS_935309] Week 26 VO 2 at V AT from 
Week 26 maximal VO 2. The predicted value from the model was used to impute VO 2 at V AT 
when maximal VO 2 was available; when maximal VO 2 was also missing, the average from 
all subje cts with non -missing values was imputed.  
Missing item scores for rating scales were imputed according to published methodology for 
the scale. Otherwise, missing data were  not estimated for secondary e fficacy endpoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring  
The PHN  DSMB  convened at least twice per year to review safety data. In addition, the 
DSMB was asked to review all data after the first [ADDRESS_935310] of results rel eased from other 
studies, due to failure to enroll, or due to withdrawal of study approval by [CONTACT_689527]. 
In addition, the NHL BI retained the right to discontinue the study prior to the inclus ion of the 
intended number of subjects but  intended to e xercise these rights only for valid scientific or 
administrative reasons.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 84 of 148 After primary outcome data were obtained for approximately half of the originally planned 
sample size (approximately N=200  subjects) , the variance of the primary outcome was 
estimate d using a blinded method with lumped variance. If this estimated variance was higher 
than the one used for the sample size calculations, then the sample size would have been 
recalculated and increased  correspondingly. Otherwise, the sample size would not change,  
and the study  would proceed as planned. This approach was based on blinded re -estimation 
of nuisance parameters and did not lead to inflation of type I error. It was consistent with the 
regulatory guidance for industry in adaptive design of clinical  studie s.  
The estimated variance at the interim analysis did not require an increase  in sample size.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multicent er Studies  
The study was conducted at 30 sites. Change in maximal VO 2 is summarized by [CONTACT_689528]  14.2.1. 2.5 using units of mL/min and in Table [IP_ADDRESS].5  using units of mL/kg/min.  
Change in VO 2 at V AT is summarized by [CONTACT_689529]  [IP_ADDRESS].6  using units of mL/min  and 
in Table [IP_ADDRESS].6  using units of mL/kg/min . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity  
Formal hypothesis testing was performed only for the primary efficacy endpoint. No 
adjustment for multiple comparisons was made for se condary efficacy endpoints . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Use of an "Efficacy Subset" of Subject s 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed with the ITT population, which included all 
randomized subj ects and was the primary population for efficacy analyses. Sensitivity 
analys es were performed for the Per Protocol population  (Table  14.2. 1.1.4 , Table  [IP_ADDRESS].4 , 
Table  [IP_ADDRESS].4, and Table  14.2. 2.2.4 ), which included all treated subjects who met all ent ry 
criteria or, if criteria were not met, were granted a waiver by [CONTACT_1034] ; subjects with major 
protocol deviations  were excluded .

udenafil on e xercise capacity in adolescents with Fontan physiology . The protocol -specified 
primary exercise outcome was change in maximal VO 2 and secondary exercise outcomes 
included change in VO 2 at V AT, change in ventilatory efficiency at V AT, and work rate at 
V AT. All exercise measures demonstrated a favorable outcome for udenafil relative to 
placebo.  
For maximal VO 2, the udenafil group had a mea n increase from baseline to Week  26 
compared to a mean decrease in the placebo group ( 44.40  mL/min versus -3.65 mL/min ; 
p=0.071 ). When standardized by [CONTACT_6992]’s body weight, the least squares mean

Relative Uti lity of Maximal VO 2 Versus VO 2 at V AT  
The protocol -specified primary endpoint of m aximal VO 2 measures overall aerobic capacity 
and has been shown to be useful as a p redictor of cardiac death and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222885], both in congenital and acquired heart disease. Given the relative ease of obtaining this 
measure and its utility as a surrogate outcome, max imal VO 2 has been chosen as an endpoint 
in multiple  observational studies and clinical trials. In view of the above, and to be consistent 
with generally accepted understanding in the pediatric cardiology community, max imal VO 2 
was cho sen as the primary endpoint for the FUEL trial. An alternative exercise m easure, VO 2 
at V AT , was also considered during the initial study design, but was designated as a secondary 
endpoint for 2 reasons: 1) There were more limited relevant data from prior studies to allow 
for a robust power calculation, and 2) VO [ADDRESS_935319] statistical power in this rare pediatric disease. The 
concern about data loss was confirmed in the FUEL trial in which 2 1% of participants did not 
have paired data VO 2 at V AT (Table  [IP_ADDRESS].2 ) versus 5% for max imal VO 2 
(Table  [IP_ADDRESS].2 ). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_689452], recent publications suggest that max imal 
VO 2 may not be an ideal efficac y measure for interventions in Fontan physiology, particularly 
for therap ies that would improve exercise performance by [CONTACT_689530] . During

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 92 of 148 exercise, there is a substantial increase in metabolic demand for oxygen delivery and, 
therefore, cardia c output. In the absence of a sub -pulmonary pump, preload is maintained b y 
the pressure gradient across the pulmonary vascular bed; the difference between CVP and 
atrial pressure. As exercise intensity increases, CVP must rise to allow for increased 
transp ulmonary blood flow (Qp). Udenafil may modulate this relationship by [CONTACT_689531] a lower CVP for any given amount of Qp. However, as exercise 
intensity increases, modification of PVR alone may not be sufficient to allow for the needed 
increase in cardiac output. Even with optimal pulmonary vasodilati on, an increase in CVP is 
required to provide adequate Qp to keep up with metabolic demand. At the highest levels of 
exertion, one begins to exceed the physiologic limit of maximal CV P. This physiologic limit, 
or ceiling, is that point at which exercise is  limited by [CONTACT_689532].  
In a person with a structurally normal heart, there is no physiologic ceiling during exercise 
related to venous pressure. CVP, which  starts at [ADDRESS_935320] a sub -pulmonary ventricle, CVP starts out 
much higher (12  to 15 mmHg) and then increases dramatically with exercise. This high 
pressure ca nnot be sustained beyond the physiologic ceiling and results in limited ability to 
maintain ventricular preload and increase cardiac output at higher levels of aerobic exertion. 
Thus, while pulmonary vasodilators may improve exercise capacity at moderate l evels of 
activity, there is a physiologic limit to their ability to impact  performance at levels of exertion 
approaching the physiologic ceiling. Studies published since the incep tion of the FUEL trial 
highlight these unique physiological limitations in th e Fontan circulation and point away 
from the selection of max imal VO 2 as an endpoint for this specific type of congenital heart 
disease  (Goldberg  2021; Navaratnam  2016 ).  
As a con sequence of the physiologic l imitations associated with Fontan palliation, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689453]. VO2 at V AT is a me asure of 
submaximal exercise that represents the physiologic point at which the metabolic demands of 
the exercising muscles begin to outstrip the ability of the cardiovascular system to deliver 
adequate amounts of oxygen to meet those demands. While VO 2 at V AT is more technically 
difficult to measure than peak VO 2, it has the same association with important morbidities 
and mortality as max imal VO 2 (Gitt 2002 ; Malhotra  2016 ; Tsai 2018 ). Given the unique 
features of the Fontan circul ation, VO [ADDRESS_935321] dose was 179.8  days in the udenafil group and 
182.7  days in the placebo group ( Table  23). Mean percent compliance with study drug was

summarized separately for baseline age tertile s in Table  30. 
Within the low age tertile  (N=133) , a notably greater percentage of subjects in the udenafil 
group experienced dizziness (11.1% udenafil, 4.9% placebo), headache ( 38.9% udenafil,

Weight at Baseline  
For weight at baseline, comparisons are focused on the extremes of the weight range (ie, low 
tertile versus high tertile).  In the udenafil group, there was a notable increase in the l ow 
weight tertile versus the high weight tertile for the percentage of subjects experiencing nausea 
(9.3% versus 3.5%), headache (4 1.3% versus 28.1%) , and flushing (1 6.0% versus 10.5%).

greater percentage of subjects in the placebo group experienced che st pain (2.7% udenafil, 
8.5% placebo)  and dizziness (6.7% udenafil , 11.9% placebo) . 
Within the high weight tertile  (N=134) , a notably greater percentage of subjects in the

Six subjects (4 udenafil, 2 placebo) had serious TE AEs that were considered related to study 
drug (Table  14.3.11A ). In the udenafil group, drug-related serious TEAE s included anxiety 
and bronchospasm reported in [ADDRESS_935329] s experienced a 
drug-related serious TE AE of syncope. Serious adverse events considered not related to study 
drug by [CONTACT_689536]  14.3.11B . All serious TE AEs are listed in 
Table 33. 
A short description is provided below for each drug -related serious TE AE. 
A 15-year-old male (Subj ect 130008) in the udenafil group experienced a serious TEAE of 
diplegia (verbatim: inability to move legs ) on Day [ADDRESS_935330] reported the event had resolved and was fully 
back to normal.  
A 14 -year-old female (Subject 140 015) in the udenafil group experienced a serious TEAE of 
retinal vascular occlusion (verbatim: retinal vascular occlusion) on Day 128. The event w as 
severe in intensity , considered possibly related to study drug per the Investigator , and resulted 
in perman ent discontinuation of study drug . The subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689458] b lurry vision and gray spots, 
progressing to complete gray within [ADDRESS_935331] (4+) and s lit lamp  examination showed blurred optic  disc margins and 
slightly pallid temporal region without blood and mas sive whitening with cherry red  spot. 
The retina had narrowed arterioles with mild ‘boxcarring’ with question o f a small  cilioretinal 
artery that did not extend to the macula.  The subject was not receiving anticoagulant therapy 
at the time of the event due to past history of hemoptysis; however, evaluation for a 
hypercoagulable state showed no significant findings.  Additional evaluations including 
computed tomography scan of the head, brain magnetic resonance imaging , magnetic 
resonance angiography , and dupl ex studies of the carotid artery and lower extremities were 
unremarkable. The subject was discharged with a di agnosis of complete occlusion of the 
central retinal artery without evidence of thromboembolism. The vision loss was permanent 
and was considered stable at the date of her final study telephone call.  
An 18 -year-old female (Subject 210003) in the udenafil g roup experienced serious  TEAEs of 
anxiety (verbatim: anxiety) and bronchospasm (verbatim:  bronchospasm ). The anxiety event 
began on Day 3 5, was severe in intensity and considered possibly  related to study drug per 
the Investigator ; the event  was noted as r esolved on Day 40 . The bronchospasm event began 
on Day 8 6, was of moderate intensity, and considered possibly related to study drug per the 
Investigator; this event was ongoing at study completion. Salbutamol was prescribed on 
Day 86. The subject also expe rienced nonserious TEAEs of mild dyspnoea and mild upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_689459] .  
A 19 -year-old male ( Subject 530013) in the udenafil group experienced a serious TEAE of 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] (verbatim: palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332]) that began on Day 45. The e vent was severe in intensity 
and considered probably related to study drug per the Inv estigator. The subject was admitted 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689460] , following an epi[INVESTIGATOR_689461] . Study drug was interrup ted for the event. The event was treated

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 125 of 148 12.6 Safety Conclusions  
A notably larger percentage (≥5 percentage points) of ude nafil-treated than placebo -treated 
subjects reported at l east 1 TEAE (79.0% versus 67.5%) and at least 1 drug-related TEAE 
(66.0% versus 42.5%). The incidence of TEAEs of Grade ≥3, serious TE AEs, dru g-related 
serious TE AEs, and TEAEs resulting in temporary  or permanent discontinuation of study 
drug was similar between treatment groups.  
A notably greater percentage (≥5 percentage points) of subjects in the udenaf il group as 
compared to the placebo grou p reported headache (39.0% versus 25.5%), flushing 
(14.5%  versus 6.0%), epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (10.0% versus 3.0%), nausea (9.5% versus 4.5%), and 
erection increased (6.3% of males versus 0.8% of males) .  
There were no clinically  important differences in the TEAE profile among subgroups defined 
by [CONTACT_547]  (female, male), race  (Caucasian /White , non -Caucasian /White ), ethnicity (Hispanic 
or Latino/Latina, not Hispanic or Latino/Latina), age (tertiles at baselin e), and weight (tertiles  
at baseline ). 
Severe TEAEs were reported for 10 (5.0%) udenafil -treated subjects and 6 (3.0%) 
placebo -treated subjects; no life -threatening TEAEs were reported in either treatment group. 
Dizziness was the only severe TEAE reported by >[ADDRESS_935355] (2 placebo  subjects).  
No subject died during the study. At least 1 serious TE AE was reported by 14  (7.0%) s ubjects

At least 1 TEAE leading to temporary or permanent discontinuation of study drug was 
reported by 18 (9.0%) subjects i n the udenafil group and  13 (6.5%) subjects in the placebo  
group . Headache was the only TEAE leading to temporary or perm anent discontinuation of 
study drug reported by >2 subjects in either  treatment group (3 subj ects each in the udenafil

Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd  5.[ADDRESS_935356] of 26 wee ks of treatment with 
udenafil on exercise capacity in adolescents with Fontan physiology . The  protocol -specified 
primary exercise outcome was change in maximal VO 2 and secondary exercise outcomes 
included change in VO 2 at V AT, change in ventilatory efficie ncy at V AT, and work rate at 
V AT. All exercise measures demonstrated a favorable outcome for uden afil relative to 
placebo.  
For maximal VO 2, the udenafil group had a mean increase from baseline to Week  26 
compared to a mean decr ease in the placebo group (44 .40 mL/min versus -3.65 mL/min ; 
p=0.071 ). When standardized by [CONTACT_6992]’s body weight, the le ast squares mean 
treatment group difference was 0.64  mL/kg/min (p=0.092 ).  
The following  secondary efficacy endpoints measured at VAT also indicated greater ex ercise 
capacity in the udenafil group than the placebo group at Week 26:  
• VO 2 at V AT : Mean increas e (improvement) for udenafil  as compared to a mean 
decrease in the placebo group (29.65  mL/min  versus -8.01 mL/min ; p=0.023 ). When 
standardized by [CONTACT_6992] ’s body weight, the least squares mean treatment group 
difference was 0.78 mL/kg/min (p=0.0 12). 
• VE/VCO 2 at V AT: Greater mean decrease (improvement) for udenafil as compared to 
placebo ( -0.76 versus -0.05; p=0.011 ). 
• Work rate at V AT: Greater mean increase (improvement) for udenafil as compared to 
placebo ( 3.46 watts versus 0.31 watts ; p=0.029 ). 
An addi tional efficacy aim evaluate d the effect of 26 weeks of treatment with udenafil on the 
performance of a single ventricle. The primary measure of ventricular pe rformance was 
change in MPI, which indicated improvement with udenafil versus placebo ( -0.02 v ersus 
0.01; p=0.024).  
Common TEAEs with a notably greater incidence (≥5 percentage points) in the udenafil 
group as compared to the placebo group included headach e, flushing, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], nausea, and 
erection increased (in males). These events have been reported with other PDE -5 inhibitors 
([COMPANY_007]  2017 ).

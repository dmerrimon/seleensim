 1 Introduction 
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder of cholesterol metabolism that affects one in 250 
(more than 1.3 million) American men, women, and children of all races and ethnicities. FH causes lifelong 
elevation of low -density lipoprotein chole sterol (LDL -C) (over 190 mg/dL) and increased risk for premature 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ), and is associated with a 10 - to 20 -fold increase in risk of 
major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, st roke, or transient 
ischemic attack). Early diagnosis followed by [CONTACT_768164]. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  (NHLBI) , and American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommend evidence -based guid elines for FH screening, diagnosis, and treatment, but despi[INVESTIGATOR_768142], up to 90% of FH patients remain undiagnosed. Cascade screening is an evidence -based practice 
of contact[CONTACT_768165] ; it improves timely diagnosis, 
reduces morbidity, and has been shown to be cost -effective in other countries.  However, implementation 
in the U.S. is challenging due to regulatory restrictions and lack of a national healthcare system and thus, 
usual care in the U.S. relies on the proband (i.e. the first person in the family who receive an FH diagnosis) 
to contact [CONTACT_768166] e FH screening.  Improving implementation of cascade screening 
may have particular promise for subgroups of pat ients at risk of, or already experiencing, health inequities . 
Although improved identification and treatment of FH is needed for all groups, there is evidence of 
inequities in diagnosis and effective treatment among several sociodemographic groups, including Black  
or African American and Asian people, and women.   
 The NHLBI award ed our team an R61/R33 grant to refine and test two promising approaches to implement 
cascade screening in partnership with the Family Heart Foundation (i.e. Family Heart), a nonpro fit 
research and advocacy organization. As part of the R61  phase , we will co -design  two patient- facing 
implementation strategies using behavioral economics in partnership with Family Heart and key partners 
from diverse backgrounds. We will then pi[INVESTIGATOR_768143] 20 patients with high cholesterol and/or  
FH to ascertain feasibility , acceptability, and appropriateness. As part of the R33  phase , we will conduct a 
3-arm hybrid Type 3 effectiveness -implementation randomized controlled trial. PLEASE NOTE: this 
protocol only outlines the R61 activities  as this is a multiphase award from N HLBI . Before we begin any 
R33 activities, we will submit a modification to the IRB for review and approval.  
 By [CONTACT_768167], our study results will be poised to guide future wide -scale implementation of cascade screening for FH and other genetic conditions within and 
outside large health systems while also answering important questions related to equitable implementation.

elevation of low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C; >190 mg/dL in adults, >160 mg/dL in children) and 
increased risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and is associated with a 10 - 
to 20 -fold increase in risk of major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, coronary 
revascularization, stroke, or tran sient ischemic attack).2,[ADDRESS_1053489] lives. The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) , 
NHLBI , and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend evidence -based guidelines for FH screening, 
diagnosis, and treatment, but despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] t his broad consensus, up to 90% of FH patients remain 
undiagnosed.
6 When a diagnosis is made, it often comes decades late. The Family Heart  Foundation’s 
national longitudinal CASCADE FH® Registry initiative, the only one of its kind in the U.S., shows that the 
Version 10/20 /2022   Page 4 of 16 
 average ages of statin initiation and FH diagnosis are 39 and 47, respectively, even though diagnosis and 
treatment can and should begin at ages 2 and 10, respectively.7 
 
Cascade screening —an evidence -based practice of contact[CONTACT_768168] —improves timely diagnosis, reduces morbidity, and has been shown to be cost -
effective in other countries.8,9,10,11,12,13,[ADDRESS_1053490] -degree biological relatives (parents, siblings, children) have 
a 50% chance of having FH, and systematic testing facilitates early diagnosis and connection to care.[ADDRESS_1053491] information was shared with the Foundation for Tracing Hereditary Hypercholesterolemia, which 
served as a centralized coordinating body that contact[CONTACT_768169]. The program identified 70% of FH cases 
nationwide. Its success is attributed, in part, to the direct contact [CONTACT_578551], which involved 
significant outreach outside of a visit -based healthcare m odel.[ADDRESS_1053492] family members and encourage FH screening.
19 In one of the few studies available,20 we randomized 240 individuals with a 
clinical diagnosis of FH to genetic testing for FH (n=160) or usual care with lipid testing alone (n=80). The 
primary study endpoint was the proportion of probands with at least one relative enrolled in the study within 1 year after notification of results. Despit e active attempts to encourage cascade screening, only 
38 (15.8%) probands overall had at least one family member contact [CONTACT_768170], only 28 probands (11.7%) had at least one family member enroll. Overall, a total of only 43 family members (0.2 
family members per proband) were enrolled over the [ADDRESS_1053493] particular promise for subgroups of patients at 
risk of, or already experiencing, health inequities . Although improved identification and treatment of FH 
is needed for all groups, there is evidence of inequities in diagn osis and effective treatment among several 
sociodemographic groups, including Black  or African American people and Asian people, and women.
21 
For example, Black people (across genders) and women were found to be diagnosed with FH several years 
later than a verage, and Black and Asian people were 50% less likely to achieve LDL -C<100 mg/dL.[ADDRESS_1053494] experienced discrimination32 
may influence acceptability of implementation approaches to cascade screening. For example, prior 
research in other areas of health behavior suggests that messaging from health systems may be less effective for Black men.
33 Yet 74% of studies in a scopi[INVESTIGATOR_768144]’ race or ethnicity, and none of those that did focused on racial and ethnic minority populations.
34 In order to ensure that cascade screening efforts do not exacerbate 
Version 10/20 /[ADDRESS_1053495] practices from implementati on science; attention to patient/family, clinician, and 
health system perspectives; effective engagement and utilization of strategies that facilitate contact [CONTACT_768171]; and inclusion of key principles  related to 
decision -making and behavior. The proposed project will integrate these fields to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_768145] a centralized, direct contact [CONTACT_350381]: a health system -mediated 
strategy using automated text messag es and a Family Heart Foundation -mediated strategy delivered by a 
navigator, outside of the healthcare setting.
[ADDRESS_1053496] lives.  
 2 Study Objectives  
We will design, refine, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_768146] R33 clinical trial, consistent with these recommendations.  
• R61 Aim 1 . Co-design both implementation strategies using behavioral economics in partnership 
with the Family Heart Foundation and key partners from diverse backgrounds.  
• R61 Aim 2 . Pi[INVESTIGATOR_768147] 20 patients with high cholesterol and/or with FH to ascertain 
feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness.  
 3 Investigational Plan & Design  
• R61 Aim 1 . We will engage in interviews with patients with high cholesterol and/or FH , family 
members, and clinicians to identify common barriers and facilitators for individuals to engage in 
cascade screening. These activities will occur in the first 6 months  and will serve as inputs into the 
design of the implementation strategies to ensure that strategies address determinants identified 
in the interviews.   
• R61 Aim [ADDRESS_1053497] the implementation strategies and our planned 
data collection approaches.  
 
3.1 Study Measures  
• R61 Aim 1 . We developed a semi -structured interview guide, which received IRB approval.  
• R61 Aim 2 . We developed  a semi -structured interview guide to use after each mini pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].  We will 
assess feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness  of the implementation strategies via 3 
questionnaires that will be administered verbally during the interview (12 items total): Feasibility 
of Intervention Measure, Acceptability of Intervention Measure, and Intervention 
Appropriateness Mea sure. These 4 -item psychometrically -validated measures capture the extent 
to which people believe an implementation strategy is feasible, acceptable, and appropriate.  We 
will also ask participants open -ended questions that elaborate on their responses to the 
quantitative measures. We will also ask about their perceptions of and experience with cascade 
screening, including barriers and facilitators. We will iterate to improve on each component during each mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_768148] . 
 
Version 10/20 /2022   Page 6 of 16 
 4 Study Population and Duration of Participation  
• R61 Aim 1 (Interviews ). We will conduct interviews with three groups ( patients with high 
cholesterol and/or FH, family members, and clinicians [MDs, APPs ]) to understand 
barriers and facilitators to cascade screening. 10 clinicians are being interviewed currently 
through our sister protocol 849516 (MPIs: Volpp, Beidas, Rader) ; in an effort to reduce 
interview burden on clinicians, the 849516 study team sub mitted a modification to add 
questions to their interview guide about barriers and facilitator for individuals to engage in cascade screening. As part of this protocol, we will focus  on conducting interviews 
with 1 5 Penn Medicine patients with high cholesterol and/or FH and [ADDRESS_1053498] the length of one qualitative interview.  Aim 1 interviews 
will be completed by [CONTACT_768172].   
• R61 Aim 1 (Meeting – NOT HUMAN SUBJECT RESEA RCH). We will convene a group of 10 
experts to review and discuss these findings, including people that represent the following perspectives: patients with high cholesterol and/or FH, family members, clinicians, setting leaders, implementation scientists, behavioral economists, and Family Heart Foundation leaders. We will prioritize diversity in the selection of people with regard to racial/ethnic minority background, gender, and income. We are not conceptualizing these 10 experts as research subjects, i.e. we wi ll not be collecting any 
research data from these individuals. We are simply convening this meeting to help us discuss and refine the data collected during interviews to produce the behavioral 
roadmap that describes barriers to implementation of cascade screening and facilitates 
the development of the two implementation strategies we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_287579] 2.   
• R61 Aim 2 (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_768149]). Participants will include 20 patients with high 
cholesterol and/or FH. At least half will identify as racial and/or ethnic minorities (i.e., Black or African American, Asian), female, and/or have low income. Patients will be randomized to receive the health system -mediated strategy or the Family Heart 
Foundation -mediated strategy. Duration of participation will last up to [ADDRESS_1053499] 20 patients complete  the mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_48409]; we anticipate 
more than 20 patients will need to be enrolled in order to reach our target of 20 
completed participants (e.g., due to loss to follow -up and subject  dropout). Study team 
members at Penn and Northwestern will collaborate closely to outreach participants and 
conduct these activities.  Participants will be identified via Penn’s  EHR and/or using the 
CASCADE FH registry  (see more info here: 
https://familyheart.org/cascade -fh-registry -
clinical ),  which is a registry of patients who have  FH and is maintained by [CONTACT_768173]. We would only outreach individuals from  the registry who are Penn Medicine 
patients.  
 
 
4.1 Eligibility  Criteria  
• Patients with high cholesterol and/or FH (R61 Aims 1 and 2 Interviews and R61 Aim 2 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_768150]). Adults aged 18 and older with clinically diagnosed FH who are treated within 
Penn Medicine  
• Family Members ( R61 Aims 1 and 2 i nterviews) . Adults aged [ADDRESS_1053500] a family 
member who has been identified as a patient with high cholesterol and/or FH who is treated 
within Penn Medicine  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1053501] Recruitment  
Our recruitment strategy does not target any populations defined by [CONTACT_768174] 45 CFR 46 subparts B, C, or D as vulnerable (i.e. children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners) as p art of this 
research study and thus this protocol does not require additional protection consideration. Our 
Version 10/20 /[ADDRESS_1053502] via email or phone by a research staff. We will follow -up no more than six  
additional times to recruit them to participate in this research protocol.    
• Patients with high cholesterol and/or FH (R61 Aims 1 and 2 Interviews and R61 Aim 2 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_768150]) . Patients with high cholesterol and/or FH will be recruited from the University 
of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) which consists of six large hospi[INVESTIGATOR_768151], Penn Presby[CONTACT_51616], Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Chester County Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Princeton Health, and Lancaster General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  We will be recruiting 
from primary care and cardiology practices at UPHS  throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Target population: The UPHS population includes patients of mixed socioeconomic status. It is  
estimated that there are 18,000 patients at UPHS with FH (based on the national FH prevalence 
of one in 250). This will provide an ample population from which to perform the proposed clinical  
trial. Potentially eligible patients will be identified using d ata from the electronic health record 
(PennChart) and Clarity, PennChart’s reporting database.   
• Family Members ( R61 Aims 1 and 2  interviews) . Patients with high cholesterol and/or with FH 
will be asked to identify family members who would be willing to engage in an interview with our 
study team.  
 5 Study Procedures  
• R61 Aim 1  (Interviews) .  
○ Individuals will be invited to complete an eligibility screen either through REDCap or the Way 
to Health platform along with an electronic consent (which will contain a contact [CONTACT_768175]), in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_133215]. Patients can register electronically 
or directly with the study coordinator.  
○ Interviews will occur either by [CONTACT_768176]. We will use purposive sampling to recruit 1 5 patients with high 
cholesterol and/o r FH and 10 family members to ensure diversity in responses; however, we 
will continue interviewing until we reach thematic saturation. We will oversample for the 
following patient populations given established inequities : Black  or African American 
individuals, Asian individuals, women of all races, and people with low income. We will also ensure diversity in age, given that privacy and he alth concerns may vary based on an 
individual’s stage of life or generation. Interviews will be digitally recorded with the participants’ permission.  
○ Interviews will be [ADDRESS_1053503] used in other studies. Acknowledging that individuals are not always able to report accurately on factors influencing their behavior, we will also deploy an approach used in previous work to infer behavioral barriers driv ing suboptimal 
implementation behavior.  
○ Participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_1053504] for engaging in this one time interview.  
○ Aim 1 interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_768177].   
• R61 Aim 1 (Behavioral Road map and Development of implementation strategies (NOT HUMAN 
SUBJECT RESEARCH) . 
Version 10/20 /2022   Page 8 of 16 
 ○ Using the interview results and behavioral insights to understand clinician and patient 
decision -making, consistent with previous work, we will produce a behavioral roadmap that 
describ es barriers to implementation of cascade screening. We will lay out the steps in the 
process where there appear to be hurdles and the behavioral biases that might be 
contributing to low rates of cascade screening. This roadmap will additionally account for  
organizational and system -level factors known to potentially hinder implementation of 
evidence -based practices. We anticipate developi[INVESTIGATOR_768152], one deployed within the health system context using an automated solution, the other deployed 
through Family Heart  outside of healthcare settings using a navigator. We will use our findings 
from Aim 1 and begin the process of matching the observed barriers to implementation strategies informed by [CONTACT_768178][INVESTIGATOR_120229]  (i.e. a systematic procedure  
we have successfully used in previous studies) , to incorporate key literature, inputs from Aim 
1, and partner input . We will convene a half- day retreat with partners to present and refine 
our implementation strategies in anticipation of the R33 phase.  Note, we do not 
conceptualize these activities as human subject research ; rather these are activities that are 
required to produce the implementation strategi es we will be testing in the Aim 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_768153] R33 phase.   
• R61 Aim 2 (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_768149]) .  
○ To “learn quickly and fail fast,” we will use rapid cycle approaches method, which is intended to accelerate development, initial testing, and refinement of an innovation (e.g., a new 
implementation strategy) to avoid investing potentially unnecessary time and resources at scale before determining whether that approach is effective. For example, in testing whether a wireless device could improve glycemic control, we first tested ways to increase initial engagement with the device. Rapid cycle approaches leverage observation and mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_768154]- world circumstances in an efficient, cost -
effective, and reliable way. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_768155], implementation of a minimally viable product, evalu ation, and 
concept refinement. Given the cost of developi[INVESTIGATOR_768156], this is an ideal way to prototype strategies.  
○ We will refine the development of the content and delivery components of our two 
implementation strategies following mini- pi[INVESTIGATOR_48409]. These mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_768157]  4 patients per condition per week (n = approximately 8  per week). Following 
the establishment of the procedure, we anticipate that this process will unfold for up to six 
months  and include  up to [ADDRESS_1053505] mini- pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], a clinical research coo rdinator, acting 
as a “fake back end” for the Way to Health platform that delivers automated text messages, will deploy text messages with two patients and their family members and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_768158], content, and tone of the messa ges. The other patients will engage 
with the Family Heart navigator and provide feedback on the timing, content, and tone of the 
discussions. During the next mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we would enroll approximately  4 new patients with 
high cholesterol and/or FH per condi tion and make modifications based on the previous mini -
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. The goal of this will be to refine our 2 active implementation strategies. Both active 
implementation strategies will include centralized outreach to patients with high cholesterol and/or FH and  direct contact [CONTACT_768179]. Key differences include 
delivery modality (automated SMS messages vs. navigator) and centralization scheme (health system vs. a national organization).  
○ Regardless of implementation strategy, family members will be offered FH screening at no 
cost via a blood lipid panel or genetic test. Although this implementation strategy is

During interviews, participants will be asked questions from the Aim 2 interview  guide as described above. We will obtain verbal informed consent before 
beginning the interviews. Interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_768182]/or Northwestern 
study teams.  Interviews will last approximately 15 -30 minutes.

• R61 Aim 1  (Interviews) . Participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_1053508] for engaging in this 
one time interview.  
• R61 Aim 2 ( Interviews ). Participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_1053509] will also be 
compensated $[ADDRESS_1053510] their data be destroyed, the study team  will honor all requests. Otherwise, previously collected 
data will be used. The consent form will clearly state this information.   
 
6 Statistical Plan  
• R61 Aim 1 & Aim 2 (Interview Analysis ). Interview rec ordings will be professionally transcribed 
and loaded into QSR NVivo software for data management and analysis. Analysis will be guided by [CONTACT_768183] a priori attributes (i.e., constructs from the CFIR, Health Eq uity Framework, and behavioral economics) and modified grounded theory, 
which provides a rigorous, systematic approach to identifying emergent codes and themes.  This 
integrated approach uses an inductive process of iterative coding. After initial exploration of data, a comprehensive coding scheme will be developed and applied to all data to produce a fine -
grained descriptive analysis. Overseen by [CONTACT_768184] s on the study team , a sample of 
transcripts will be separately coded and their application of the coding scheme compared to assess the scheme’s reliability. Any disagreements in coding will be resolved through team discussion.

The PI [INVESTIGATOR_768160]. An adverse event (AE) is any untoward 
medical occurrence in a subject during participation in the clinical study. We anticipate two potential types 
of AEs that could be directly related to study parti cipation. These include distress experienced with regard 
to research participation and breach of confidentiality and privacy. With regard to the former, we have 
protocols in place that include conferring with one of the PI s (who is a licensed clinical psyc hologist) or a 
staff psychologist. With regard to the latter, we have appropriate safeguards to reduce risk of breach of 
confidentiality and privacy. Any risks related to additional potential AEs are not expected because this protocol poses minimal risk to  subjects.  
 All members of the research team who will be involved in the design and conduct of the study must receive education in human research subjects protection through the CITI program. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_768161]. If new personnel and staff become involved in the research, they will be required to engage in t he same CITI 
program.  
 DSMB . We have identified a four- member DSMB from faculty outside of Penn. The DSMB composition 
includes individuals with expertise in: implementation science, behavioral economics, FH, and 
biostatistics. The DSMB will be an independent group of experts charged  with reviewing study data for 
data quality and integrity, adherence to the protocol, participant safety, and study conduct and progress. 
They will also make determinations regarding study continuations, modifications, and 
suspensions/terminations. DSMB me mbers will be independent from any professional or financial conflict 
of interest with the research project and/or study investigators. The DSMB will meet annually via 
phone/video conference calls for the duration of the project. The DSMB will elect a Chair to moderate the 
meetings. At the initial meeting, the DSMB will review and approve all study protocols before study initiation to ensure participant safety. Protocols will include formal procedures for reporting and tracking 
all adverse reactions to the NIH and IRBs; tracking progress in the study; and identifying any need for 
premature termination of the protocol. At subsequent meetings, the DSMB will be provided with summary study progress reports and adverse events. The DSMB will provide a summary repo rt following 
each meeting. We will not require the DSMB to conduct interim analyses of data prior to the end of the study.  
 [ADDRESS_1053512] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorizat ion for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  All PHI 
that will be collected as part of this study include:  
• Name  
• Address  
• Date of Birth

8.2 Data Collection and Management  
As outlined in the Master Collaboration Agreement (MCA) between Northwestern, Penn, and Family 
Heart, all data saved and stored at Northwestern and Family Heart will be stored in accordance with the federal privacy and security regulations set forth at 45 CFR Parts 160 and Part 164 ( i.e., HIPAA) . Data will 
only be shared between parties as outlined in the MCA, via secure file transfer methods. All members of 
the study teams at Northwestern and Family Heart have completed human subjects training.  
 
At the Uni versity of Pennsylvania, we will use secure, encrypted servers to host the data and conduct the 
analysis to m inimize the risk of breach of data and confidentiality. The Penn Medicine Academic 
Computing Services (PMACS) will be the hub for the hardware and database infrastructure that will 
support the project. The PMACS provides a secure computing environment for a large volume of highly 
sensitive data, including clinical, genetic, socioeconomic, and financial information. PMACS requires all users of data or applications on PMACS servers to complete a PMACS -hosted cybersecurity awareness 
course annually, which stresses federal data security policies under data use agreements with the university. The curriculum includes Health Insurance Portability and Account ability Act (HIPAA) training 
and covers secure data transfer, passwords, computer security habits and knowledge of what constitutes 
misuse or inappropriate use of the server. We will implement multiple, redundant protective measures 
to guarantee the privac y and security of the participant data. All investigators and research staff with 
direct access to the identifiable data will be required to undergo annual responsible conduct of research, cybersecurity, and HIPAA certification in accordance with Universit y of Pennsylvania regulations. Data will 
be stored, managed, and analyzed on a secure, encrypted server behind the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) firewall. All study personnel that will use this data are listed on the Penn IRB application and have completed training in HIPAA standards and the Collaborative IRB Training Initiative 
(CITI) human subjects research. Data access will be password protected. Whenever possible, data will be de-identified for analysis.  
 Audio recordings from the interviews will be digitally recorded and stored in REDCap. Audio recordings will be sent to TranscribeMe, a professional transcription service. TranscribeMe services include multiple safeguards designed to protect the privacy and  security of personal health information, along with utilizing 
workers specifically cleared to work with this type of sensitive information. TranscribeMe maintains crowd worker teams that are vetted, trained, and authorized to work on content containing PHI/PII.  Data submitted to TranscribeMe is stored on servers located inside secure, dedicated Microsoft Azure data 
centers, with state- of-the-art physical and online intrusion prevention measures in place. Data is 
submitted and maintained through a secure f ile transfer protocol (SFTP) platform that has been set up 
specifically for HIPAA compliance. The service limits the amount of internal staff that has access to 
customer data within this SFTP only to essential personnel. Transcripts will be loaded into NVIVO 
qualitative data analysis software for management and analysis. Qualitative analysis is described in the Statistical Analysis section below.  
 A number of  procedures will be utilized to ensure confidentiality of participant data. First, all qualitative 
interview participants will be assigned a random ID number. This ID number will be used on all data collected from participants. The names that correlate to those ID numbers will be kept separate, i.e. identifiable data will be stored in one file and de -identified research data will be kept in a separate file.  
The key linking ID numbers to participant names will only be kept in REDCap. Only the research team 
outlined in this application will have access to the participant’s identifiable data. Electronic records (e.g., 
digital audio files) will be stored in REDCap as well as on a PMACS HIPAA -compliant server. All requests to 
Version 10/20 /2022   Page 12 of 16 
 use the data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_32816]. Any data files provided to other individuals will be de -identified 
and contain only the random ID numbers. Participants will be notified of the above procedures during 
informed consent.  
 
8.3 Risks  
Participants may experience discomfort when asked to answer questions or complete questionnaires with 
the Penn and/or Northwestern team, Family Heart navigator, or via the REDCap or Way to Health 
platform. These activities may make them feel temporarily uncomfortable or experience an emotional 
response (e.g., anxiety, frustration). Participants may also experience possible embarrassment, distress, or inconvenience related to questions  regarding personal information. The risk level is low and these risks 
will be minimized by [CONTACT_768185] a question or discontinue their participation at any time; one of the PIs is a licensed clinical psycho logist (Beidas) and 
can provide support around distress and appropriate referrals.  
 Participants will also be informed that their responses will be kept private and not be shared with anyone outside of the research team, within the limits to confidentiali ty in research studies. There is also the 
potential risk of breach of confidentiality. While there is always the possibility of a breach of confidentiality when conducting research and while the likelihood of such is very low, we take a number of precautio ns  
to minimize the possibility of breach of confidentiality, including that: 1) all research team staff will be 
well trained in confidentiality and data security procedures; 2) data will be rendered anonymous to the 
degree possible to minimize likelihood of any individual being identified; 3) all data will be kept locked at all times in a secure office building; and 4) all electronic records and audio recordings will be password 
protected. Another possible type of breach of confidentiality is if an organiz ation learns about some of 
the impressions a staff person has about their health system. To minimize this risk, we will de -identify all 
interview transcripts and questionnaires and maintain them in a confidential manner. We will ensure 
there are protection s in place so that data are only accessible by [CONTACT_768186].  
 All risks and the ways in which the research team will minimize them will be explained during the consenting of all potential participants. Participants will not  be required to complete research measures 
or interviews and lack of participation will not impact the care they receive at Penn Medicine.   
 
The team at Penn Medicine and/or Northwestern  will consent participants and, if randomized to the 
Family Heart strategy, the participant's information will be shared with Family Heart so that their 
navigator can reach out directly to the patients with high cholesterol and/or FH  to discuss cascade 
screening.  We will work closely with the Penn IRB to mitigate any risks  related to this agreement, and we 
will outline this information clearly in the consent. The Family Heart Foundation and Northwestern teams 
will take precautions similar to the above to mitigate the possibility of breach of confidentiality.  All 
activities will fall under agreements established between the Family Heart Foundation , Northwestern 
University,  and the University of Pennsylvania Office of Research Services.  
 
Regardless of implementation strategy, family members may be offered FH screening at no c ost via a 
blood lipid panel or genetic test. If a family member receive s a blood lipid panel, the risks of venipuncture 
for blood drawing (for lipid panel) include pain, bleeding, bruising, infection, and inflammation at the site. The risk level is minimal and unlikely to impact subjects as blood draws are very common and will be 
performed by [CONTACT_54339]. If the family member receive s a genetic test, the physical risk of 
saliva genetic test is minimal. However, genetic tests that generate information about subjects' personal 
health risks can provoke anxiety and confusion, damage familial relationships, and compromise the subjects' insu rability and employment opportunities. The risks of genetic tests will be discussed at length 
with participants and participants are not required to get genetic tests in order to participate in this study.  
Version 10/20 /[ADDRESS_1053513] benefits of the pro posed research to the participants. Participants may indirectly 
benefit from participation. Patients with high cholesterol and/or FH and family members may learn about 
FH, risks related to this disorder, and ways to minimize health risks. Discussing their experiences with the 
implementation strategies may contribute to participants reflecting on how to reduce their risk of cardiac 
events as it relates to FH.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1053514] particular promise 
for subgroups of pati ents at risk of health inequities . Behavioral economic approaches, which include the 
use of ‘choice architecture’ to harness the power of the environment to support behavior change, have been effectively leveraged to change behavior in multiple areas of medicine. Study results will help us determine promising strategies to increase equitable implementation of cascade screening with the ultimate goal of improving detection and outcomes for individuals with FH. Participants may indirectly benefit from participation by [CONTACT_768187]. The ratio of risks to benefit is reasonable given the 
importance of the information to be gained by [CONTACT_31295].  
 
8.6 Informed Co nsent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
Waiver of Written Documentation of Consent . We are requesting a waiver of written documentation of 
consent for participants who agree to participate in the Aim [ADDRESS_1053515] a signed 
copy of the combined consent and HIPAA document. These research activities present no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally 
required outside of the research context.  
 
Individuals will be informed that the study is 100% voluntary and not mandatory. It will be clearly stated 
that patients do not have to participate in this research in order to get care at Penn Medicine. The research team will ensure that the potential parti cipant has all the additional necessary information (e.g., the 
research objectives, procedures, duration, risks, benefits, etc.) to make an informed decision about whether or not they want to participate in the study.  
 
• For Aim 1 and Aim 2 qualitative interviews, consent  and HIPAA authorization  will be obtained either 
by [CONTACT_768188]. The study team  member (from Penn and/or Northwestern)  will ask 
the participant to be in a private location during the call. We will schedule th e interview at a time 
most convenient to the participant. The interviews will be audio -recorded . We will review the 
required elements of informed consent and HIPAA authorization and answer any questions the 
potential participant might have before any research questions are asked and audio -recorded. 
Potential participants will be encouraged to ask questions about the project. Participants will be emailed a copy of the IRB approved consent document for their records. If they agree to participate, 
the intervie w team will document the consent process in REDCap.  
 
• For Aim 2 family member outreach , we will use passive consent language in the form of an “opt out” 
letter that explains FH, primes them that someone will reach out to them about cascade screening, 
and provides instructions on how to opt out of being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
 
Waiver of Consent.  
Version 10/20 /[ADDRESS_1053516] probands about cascade screening is at the heart of this research. You will also note in the implementation strategy language we uploaded that some elements of consent are naturally contained  in the outreach language – we are striving to integrate as much communication into 
the implementation strategies as possible to mimic what we believe would happen outside of a research study. In summary and in accordance with 45 CFR § 46.116, this researc h:  
 
1) involves no more than minimal risk to subjects;  
2) could not be carried out practicably without the waiver or alteration;  
3) the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; and,  
4) the subjects will be provided wit h additional information about their participation.

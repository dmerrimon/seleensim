PROTOCOL TITLE :  
Hybrid -FES Exercise to Prevent Cardiovascular Declines in Acute  and Chronic  SCI 
 
01/09/[ADDRESS_149390] injury (SCI) in the U.S. In the first year 
after an SCI, there are profound declines in function, forming an underlying substrate for 
future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[ADDRESS_149391], acquired cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) is an increasingly recognized consequence of SCI and is the leading cause of 
death in this population .[ADDRESS_149392] all risk factors are amplified in those with SCI;[ADDRESS_149393] in part 
from profound physiologic >detraining = resulting from motor impairment and immobility. 
Moreover, Aphysical rehabilitation after SCI needs to move beyond the goal of 
maximizing independence to focus on maintenance of optimum health and fitness; @3 
vigorous exercise of the paralyzed limbs may help achieve these objectives as well as 
reduce cardiovascular risk. However, effective interventions preventing acute declines 
that lead to ca rdiovascular compromise and increased risk in SCI are lacking.  
 
An appropriate exercise intervention early after injury could prevent or lessen many of 
the acute declines that predispose those with SCI to a myriad of long -term health risks. 
However, exerci se therapy for those with SCI is challenging and when employed, is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_132223]. Recently, we developed a unique form of 
exercise for those with SCI that specifically mirrors exercise performed by [CONTACT_132242]. Functional E lectrical Stimulation Row Training (FES -RT) couples volitional arm and 
electrically controlled leg exercise. In contrast to other forms of exercise (arms only  
exercise , FES leg cycling, or FES  leg cycling with arm exercise), FES -RT is unique in 
that the non -innervated legs are integral for the performance of this whole body 
exercise. The full rowing stroke is produced by [CONTACT_36552] (stimulated) legs and arms, 
increasing the active muscle mass and  resulting in a hemodynamic profile that produces 
the beneficial cardiac loading conditions of large muscle mass exercise. As such, FES -
RT may be a safe and effective way to attenuate cardiovascular declines following SCI. 
Our preliminary work in chronic S CI has demonstrated the feasibility of FES -RT and 
suggests important attendant changes in cardiovascular health.4However, it is 
imperative that the positive impact of FES -RT be determined in those with acute SCI, 
because it is at the early stages of injury that future medical complications can be 
prevented.  We will also  study those with chronic SCI to  provide a comparison of the  
magnitude of adaptations across a range of injury duration.

                                                                 Page 2                            Version 17   
II. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
1) To document changes in body composition (visceral adiposity) and insulin sensitivity 
(homeostatic model assessment) resulting from FES -RT in comparison to a t ime (wait -
list) control and to arms-only r ow training  (arms -only-RT) 
 
We hypothesize FES -RT will mitigate against increased visceral adiposity and reduced 
insulin sensitivity occurring with acute SCI and that FES -RT will be more effective than 
arms -only-RT.   
 
2) To quantify changes in key indices of cardiovascular health (serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]) and control 
(arterial baroreflex gain) with FES -RT in comparison to a t ime control and to arms -only-
RT 
 
We hypothesize FES -RT will prevent the worsening lipid profile and compromised 
baroreflex function occurring with acute SCI and that FES -RT will be more e ffective than 
arms -only-RT.  
 
3)To characterize  changes in myocardial structure (left ventricular wall thickness) and 
function (left ventricular diastolic velocity) with FES -RT in comparison to a t ime control 
and to arms -only-RT 
 
We hypothesize FES -RT will counter the ventricular wall thickening and declining 
ventricular function occurring with acute SCI and that FES -RT will be more e ffective 
than arms -only-RT.  
 
4) To compare the body composition, insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular health and 
control, and myocardial structure and function and the magnitude of adaptations to 
FES-RT across a range of injury duration from acute to chronic SCI.  
 
We hypothesize that cross -sectional  declines in all variables will relate directly to injury 
duration and that therefore the magnitude of adaptations will be greater with longer 
injury duration.  
 
III. SUBJECT SELECTION   
 
We will enroll [ADDRESS_149394] SCI to obtain data on 50 
individuals .  One-half o f the subjects (N=2 5) will be randomized to immediately enroll in 
[ADDRESS_149395] (N=18) will be randomized to a wait -list to provide time 
control data from baseline to [ADDRESS_149396] (N=17) of subjects will be randomized to six  months of 
arms -only-RT. This will provide data on a comparator that represents a form of arms -
only exercise that would be available to those with SC I. These subjects will undergo six  
months of FE S-RT after completing arms -only-RT. This will enhance subject retention 
and provide data for secondary analysis.  
 
To enhance subject recruitment we may enroll subjects into the study before they are [ADDRESS_149397] 
injury with  adult onset of SCI(SCI occurrence after 18 years of age) .  
 
 
All volunteers will continue with regular physical rehabilitation except for modalities that 
overlap study interventions (e.g., FES -cycling).  
 
All Subjects will be 18-[ADDRESS_149398] injury (American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_132224] A, B, C) at the neurological level of C5 -T12. Subjects will be medically 
stable (no treatment for DVT, no orthostasis, no spi[INVESTIGATOR_132225] -bearing 
precautions associat ed with a healing long -bone fracture) and be able to tolerate the 
stimulation without dysreflexia. Dysreflexia in some participants is expected in the initial 
FES sessions, but only those in whom dysreflexia abates with repeat exposures will be 
included.

The American College of Sports Medicine ’s Guidelines for Exercise Testing and 
Prescription  9th edition will be followed as the standard of care along with the clinical 
specialists ’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] ( Drs. Stephanie Cho and Aaron  Baggish) regarding any additional 
pre-participation screening needed prior to beginning this vigorous exercise training 
program.  
 
Pregnant and nursing women are not eligible for this study because of the potential risk 
to the fetus from radiation  that goes along with the DXA scan . Women who are able to 
become pregnant must agree to use contraceptive methods while participating in the 
study. Acceptable contraceptive methods are:  a) hormonal methods (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
patches , injections, vaginal ring o r implants); b) barrier methods  (condom or diaphragm, 
with a foam, cream or gel spermicide); c) intrauterine device (IUD); or d) abstinence (no 
sex).  Women are considered unable to become pregnant if they are menopausal and 
have not had a  menstrual period for at least one  year or if th ey have had a 
hysterectomy (surgical removal of your uterus and/or ovaries).   
 
IV. SUBJECT  ENROLLMENT  
 
Research study staff will obtain volunteer consent in accordance with guidelines 
established by [CONTACT_132243]. 
Participants will be sent the consent form at least [ADDRESS_149401] a 
partial screening visit in which informed c onsent and detailed health  history  will be 
obtained(all other assessments will be scheduled after they  reach at least [ADDRESS_149402] 
SCI. Once recruited for the study  volunteer s (that are at least [ADDRESS_149403] injury)  will 
visit the laboratory for a health screening session to further determine elig ibility.  This 
two may require one or two  visits depending on the ab ility to schedule with the  
physician . It will include obtaining informed consent, detailed health history , PROMIS [ADDRESS_149404] physical exam (ASIA exam and Ashworth Scale) performed 
by a physician  (if necessary) , height and weight measurements, resting blood pressure , 
electrocardiogram  (EKG) and FES-device test .  
 
Note: If an ASIA exam and Ashworth Scale have previously been performed by a 
physician and results can be obtained, those medical records may be used and the 
physical exam will not be necessary during screening.  
 
 
Subjects may also be asked to provide additional medical records or may need further 
testing to determine their eligibility and the safety of their participation in this program 
which includes  regular vigorous exercise. These additional tests may or may not be 
covered by [CONTACT_22241]. The subject  will be responsible for obtai ning any additional 
testing and providing the program with medical records or results.  
 
Approximately 40% of spi[INVESTIGATOR_132226] e amenorrhea for an average of 
eight months . Therefore, menstrual status will be tracked and explored as a potential 
covariate. A prospective menstru al diary will be collected for three  months prior to each 
data acquisition time -point. For each monthly diary, women will mark the day of the 
month when bleeding occurred and rate the heaviness of blo od flow (spotting to heavy). 
If no bleeding occurred during a particular month or the menstrual period, this will be 
indicated. Bleeding patterns will be used to define normal, irregular, or absent menstrual 
cycles.

1) FES-RT GROUP  (Acute and Chronic  SCI) 
 
FES-strength training prior to FES -RT 
To be able to FES -row, a certain level of leg muscle strength and endurance is essential; 
therefore, prior to FES -row training, the ability of the subject  to perform [ADDRESS_149405] is seated in their wheelchair or on an exam table. The stimulus 
parameters will be set at 12 s econd  period s with a 6 second  on-time per channel without a 
ramp and with a pulse width of 450ms at 50 Hz. The intensity of the stimulus to the quadriceps 
will be set at the level t hat produces full knee extension.  If the knee does not achieve full 
exten sion due to fatigue the intensity of the stimulation will be increased. If fatigue does not 
occur prior to 30 minutes, the individual will advance to FES -rowing. If fatigue occurs pr ior to 
30 minutes and  at maximal intensity (approximately 100mA) , the subject will engage in two 
weeks (3x/week) of strength training using this same protocol . Previous experience has 
indicated that this protocol is effective in enhancing muscle strength. Following two weeks of 
training, the strength and endurance capacity of the knee -extensor muscles will be evaluated 
and further training will be performed, if necessary, including the additional use of the QAA -
[ADDRESS_149406] ’s respon se to the FES -
strength training.  Subjects will also be encouraged to begin arms only rowing during the initial 
FES-strength training period. This will be done at the same vis its as the FES -strength training 
sessions. Participants will be seated on the rowing machine with the rowing seat locked in a 
fixed position and will perform short intervals of rowing at a moderate intensity using only their 
arms . Intensity will be monitor ed by [CONTACT_132244]. Subjects will 
be allowed to take the FES -device home  after they have completed the first  two weeks  of 
training and have shown  adequate understanding of how to use the device properl y. Subjects 
will perform strength  training session at  Spaulding [LOCATION_011]  or Spaulding  Cambridge   as needed  
during home strength training . Subjects will also be given a logbook to  track their usage .

only rowing intervals depending on fitness level and the response to the FES. A maximum 
FES-rowing test will be performed at baseline . This will be repeated after three months of 
training and  training intensity will be adjusted to maintain the training stimulus at the same 
relative intensity . The goal is for each volunteer to achieve an exercise intensity of 75 -85% 
maintained for a continuous  [ADDRESS_149408] two weeks of FES -leg strength training (it may take longer depending on the 
subject ’s response, see above) and when the subjects have demonstrated the ability to 
proper ly use the stimulation unit , the stimulation unit will be used at home to continue with 
leg strengthening on non FES -rowing days (~3 days/week, 30 -60 minutes/session). This  can 
be closely monitored  since they will also be exercising  3 times per week at Spaul ding [LOCATION_011] 
or  Spaulding  Cambridge.  
 
2) ARMS -ONLY -RT GROUP (Acute SCI only)  
 
The arms-only-RT group will  commence exercise training upon enrollment. Training sessions 
will be [ADDRESS_149409] of 6 sets of arms -only rowing for five  minutes at 60% of VO2peak with a work -to-
rest ratio o f 2:1 and progre ss over the six  months to  an exercise intensity of 75 -85% maintained 
for [ADDRESS_149410] will be performed at the end of the six  
months of training to determine increases in fitness. Subsequently, after the six months of 
arms-only-RT, subjects will begin the FES-RT as described above.  
 
 
 
 
 
3) WAIT -LIST GROUP (Acute SCI on ly)

                                                                 Page [ADDRESS_149411] will be performed immediately  after enrollment , after initial 
familiarization with arms-only-RT equipment  (usually 2 -3 sessions) and will be repeated 
after 3 and 6 months (before FES -RT begins).  The wait -list group will also perform the 
FES-leg strength training protocol as described above during the six months of the wait -
list period. During this time they w ill not use the FES -device on the rowing ergometer. 
Strengthening the leg muscles during the wait -list period will lessen leg muscle atrophy 
and allow faster progress in FES -row training when they enter that phase of the study.  
At the end of the 6 month wa it period , subjects will begi n the FES -RT as described 
above.   
 
Alternate Training Sites:  
 
Community Rowing Inc. as an additional training site  
After subjects have completed screening and initial leg muscle strengthening, and have 
advanced in their training to the point at which they demonstrate sufficient knowledge 
and skill  level at performing the FES -RT or arms -only-RT they may begin training a t our 
alternate training site, Community Rowing Inc (CRI).There will be a SRH staff member 
on-site at CRI to supervise all FES -row or arms -only row training sessions. Also, only 
subjects who have demonstrated the ability to transfer onto the rower safely w ith 
minimal assistance will b e allowed to perform the FES -RT or arms -only-RT at CRI. 
(There is not a lift system available at CRI.) All Laboratory visits will  continue to be 
performed at Spaulding Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_132227] . 
 
Home Rowing a s an additional training site  
Subjects who own an adapted rowing machine may perform some or all of their row 
training at home. Home rowing will only be allowed after subjects have completed 
screening an d have advanced in their FES -RT or arms -only-RT to the point atwhich 
they demonstrate sufficient knowledge and skill in the use of the FES -unit and /or the 
adapted rowing machine and fully understand their individualized exercise program. All 
subjects must also demonstrate transfer competency on and off the rower with use of 
any assistance that they will have available at home. All Laboratory visits will continue 
to be performed at  Spaulding  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_132227] . 
 
 
Note s: There is no limit or specific requirement for training sessions that must be 
attended to continue participating in this protocol. Subjects, in all training groups, will be 
encouraged by [CONTACT_132245]. Un -reported 
missed training session will be followed up with a phone call to document why the 
training session was missed and to encourage prompt return to training sessions as 
soon as possible.   
 
Subjects who enro ll before [ADDRESS_149412] (for the FES -RT group only)  
will only be performed at baseline and after [ADDRESS_149413] of: height, weight and ci rcumference measures, blood samples , 
health questionnaires, pulmonary function test s, resting cardiovascular hemodynamics 
and neck suction -barorefex testing. This extra testing session will take about 2 -hours and 
can be done on a normal training day.

Neck Suction - Baroreflex Testing:   
We will rely on neck pressure and neck suction to evaluate carotid sinus 
baroreceptor function at rest and during a variety of conditions. This technique 
has been employed to safely study cardiovascular physiology in human since the 
1950’s. The subject’s neck  is sealed by a neck collar connected to a computer -
controlled bellows (pressure/vacuum pump). The neck collar is cushioned with an 
airtight silicon rubber bladder that is independently sealed and positioned against 
the contour of the anterior lateral neck . The bellows is used to increase or 
decrease pressure inside the neck collar, effectively compressing or distending 
the carotid sinus in the neck and causing reflex changes in heart rate and muscle 
sympathetic activity. However, these responses are evanes cent since aortic 
baroreceptors are not affected; therefore heart rate and sympathetic activity (and 
sometimes blood pressure) are changed for only a few beats with any level of 
stimulus. Carotid baroreceptor reflex responses will be elicited during held 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_132230]. 
Subjects will hold a normal end -expi[INVESTIGATOR_12194], which triggers an external 
neck pressure increase of +[ADDRESS_149416] triggered reductions of 15 mmHg to a pressure of -65 mmHg. This 
sequence results in stepwise initial carotid sinus compression followed by 
[CONTACT_132246], evoking stepwise reflex changes in heart rate and sympathetic

 activity. For each baroreflex testing, t his procedure is repeated seven times to 
provide an averaged reproducible carotid baroreceptor reflex response relation.  
 
Echocardiography.  We will use a portable, commercially available system (Vivid -I, 
GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis.), for cardiac characterization.  Images will be 
obtained after [ADDRESS_149417] -study off -line data 
analysis (EchoPac, Version 6.5, GE Healthcare). Left ventricular and atrial cardiac 
chamber volumes will be calculated using  the modified Simpson =s technique. LV 
mass will be calculated using the area -length method. Relative wall thickness, an 
index of LV geometry, will be defined as: [interventricular septal thickness (mm) + 
posterior wall thickness (mm)] / LV internal end -diastolic diameter (mm). 
Myocardial tissue velocities (diastolic function) will be measured off -line from 2D 
color -coded tissue Doppler images and reported as the average of 3 consecutive 
cardiac cycles. Strain, strain rate, and LV rotational (systolic functi on) assessment 
will be performed by [CONTACT_132247]. Peak global strain will be 
calculated as the average strain in the basal, mid, and api[INVESTIGATOR_132231] [ADDRESS_149418] 
area-length method. Right ventricular diastolic area, systolic area, fractional area 
change, tissue velocities will be measured. Measurements will be indexed for body 
surface area when appropriate.  
 
Note: Subjects  may also have their echocardiogram test perfor med at the Heart 
Center at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) if the cardiologist can be 
scheduled for a more convenient time for them at MGH than at Spaulding 
Cambridge. We will pay for parking if they choose to go to MGH for their 
echocardiogram.  
 
Note : As of 1/1/19 we will no longer be able to measure any further 
echocardiogram tests in this protocol.

Blood Samples : [ADDRESS_149420] assays will 
include measures  of insulin s ensitivity  and s erum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] . The homeostasis model 
assessment (HOMA) of insulin resistance , the quantitative insulin check index 
(QUICKI)  and the serum  insulin -like growth factor binding protein -1 (IGFBP -1) will 
be assessed. Plasma total cholesterol, low density cholesterol, high density APOa 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and triglycerides will also be measured.  Other assays will include: total 
testosterone, calculated free testosterone , CBC , high sensitivity (hs) C -reactive 
protein, hemoglobin AIC, prealbumin and zinc.  Blood work will be sent to Quest 
Diagnostics for analysis.  
 
ASIA and Ashworth exams : Standard physical exams will be performed by a

DXA Scan (s) 
 A licensed radiology technician  will perform all DXA scans. We will use a 5th 
generation GE Healthcare iDXA dual x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner with 
enCore configuration version 12.3. For regional fat measurements, the DXA 
software can be used to define standard regions that will allow comparability of 
measurem ents throughout the study. DXA -derived visceral adipose tissue will be 
measured from a [ADDRESS_149422] scan. The precision of regional fat 
measures is ±1%.   
 
Note: If a DXA scan has recently been performed at Spaulding Rehabilitation 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_132233], those medical records may be used 
and the baseline DXA  scan will not be necessary.  
 
 
VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Power analysis : Based on longitudinal exercise capacity data from our lab, extensive 
sets of power analyses were performed. For th e main analysis  (acute subjects only) , 
there will be 3 groups of subjects (FES -RT, wait-list and arms -only-RT) and measures 
at baseline, 3 mo nths, 6 months, except for visceral adiposity (only at baseline and 6 
months). The primary analysis (below) will include the three groups and will have as 
predictors two indicator (dummy) variables for two of the groups, and indicators for the 3 
month and 6 month time points and interactions between the time points and the group 
indicator variables; this will be estimated as a linear mixed model. The only random 
effect will be for subject.  In addition, for the fourth aim, the analysis will only include 
those entered into into FES -RT at the outset, i.e., the FES -RT with acute SCI and all

with injury duration as a covariate.  
 
Given logistical constraints, we began with the a ssumption that data on 50 acute SCI 
subjects  (out of 60 recruited - a ~15% dropout rate) would be advantageous if that 
sample size allowed us to find differences that are substantively meaningful. This group 
would be allocated (randomly; see below) as 40% to FES -RT and 30% to each of wait -
list and arms -only-RT. We also checke d other total sample sizes and allocation rules 
(e.g., data from 20 in each group, data from 25 in FES and 15 in each of the other two 
groups).  In addition, [ADDRESS_149424] meaningful (e.g., >15%) di fferences between acute and chronic SCI at the same 
power outlined below.   
 
These calculations were performed assuming an alpha of 0.05 and a correlation 
between baseline and 6 month measure of about 0.7; unless the correlation was very 
different from 0.7 (e.g., 0.25), there was little difference in the results. This shows that 
we will have sufficient power under this plan with a sample size of [ADDRESS_149425] s and allocation of 20/15/15. Subjects will be randomized at the ratio of 1.33:1:[ADDRESS_149426] 
group assignment.  
 
Primary data analysis:  The primary analysis will test whether the FES -RT has ‘better’ 
values of the outcome variables at [ADDRESS_149427] an intent -to-treat 
analysis. The main predictors will be indicator variables for group with the FES -RT 
group as the reference group and indicators for each of the other two groups, the t ime 
at which the outcomes were measured and treatment group by [CONTACT_25218]; 
menstrual status (with men coded the same as women who are not menstruating) will 
be included as a dummy variable; for the insulin resistance measure, body weight/fat 
changes  will be included as a predictor. In a secondary analysis, we will include 
interactions terms between the group indicators and the 3  month indicator. In addition, 
similar models to the above will be estimated for secondary outcomes . 
  
Checking and Sensitivity Analyses:  It is important to ensure that data idiosyncrasies do 
not impact the results and that the results are generalizable. We will check for 
systematic differences between the model and the data using graphs, such as 
comparisons of predicte d and observed values of the outcome variable, and other 
standard diagnostics. An extension of this idea is to simulate new sets of data based on 
our model and use the simulated data as a reference test group by [CONTACT_132249]; we do t his to look for situations in which the data appear different

or severity of SCI or l evel of SCI. These will be tested by [CONTACT_132250]. It is also 
important to explore the ‘missingness’ of data. The model we plan to use assumes that 
missing data are “missing at random.” This can be checked in several ways including 
comparing the characteristics of observations with and without missing values. More 
importantly, we can check whether our results would change if the data is “missing not 
at random” in seve ral ways. For  certain outcome variables, it may be the case that 
subjects who are either at the high end or the low end are more likely to be missing. For 
example, people at baseline who are very fat or very lean may be more likely to drop 
out. This can be  checked by [CONTACT_132251]. Comparing the results based on the 
constrained imputation to the unimputed results gives us a sensitivity analysis.  
 
A second type of se nsitivity analysis was originally suggested by [CONTACT_132252], Kenward and White who suggest weighting each imputed result 
(rather than Rubin's standard “rules” of averaging the results), where the weight 
depends on the assumed de parture from the MAR assumption. This technique relies on 
the imputations covering a fairly wide range of values (we would use 100 imputations) 
but this can be checked and additional data sets imputed if the range is too narrow. 
Carpenter, et al., provide a graphic method of checking whether the range is wide 
enough. Finally, if dropouts are much more common that missing an occasion and then 
returning, we will estimate a pattern -mixture model. However, if there are many people 
who miss the 3 month measure, but not the 6 month measure, we will not pursue this 
strategy. A fourth issue deals with the variance structure of the model. Our prime model 
assumes that the variances are the same across groups. This will be tested by 
[CONTACT_131894] a model with heterogeneou s variance structures by [CONTACT_19313] (this is available in 
some statistical packages, including Stata or SAS).

Wearing th e mouthp iece during the VO2max  testing may cause feelings of 
claustrophobia. Exercise training may induce some muscle or joint discomfort when 
beginning an exercise program and could result in tendonitis and/or musculoskeletal 
overuse injuries over time. T he electrical stimulation unit can cause tingling, pi[INVESTIGATOR_132234], skin irritation, increased muscle spasticity and autonomic 
dysreflexia (signs include: headache, nausea, rise in blood pressure, sweating, and 
goosebumps). There is  some discomfort with venipuncture and the lancet used on the 
finger for lactate measurement and there is the possibility of swelling and bruising at the 
site(s), there is also a slight chance that individuals become dizzy and even faint. The 
neck suction/ pressure collar may cause some discomfort  and a mild choking feeling which 
resolves quickly when pressure or suction is turned off . 
 
The risk of DXA scanning is minimal. Participants in this study will be exposed to radiation 
from two or three  DXA scans of the whole body  depending on study group . The total 
amount of radiation that will be received from participation in this study is equal to a whole 
body exposure of less t han 0.26 milliSierverts (mSv).  For comparison, the average person 
in the [LOCATION_002] receives a radiation exposure of 3.6 mSv per year from natural 
background sources (the earth and the sky). The dose from participation in this research 
study is about th e same as what a person would normally receive in less than one  month  
from these natural sources. Scientists disagree on whether radiation doses at these low 
levels are harmful. A possible effect that could occur at doses associated with this study 
is a slight increase in the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_132235]. Women of chi ldbearing 
potential will be given a urine or serum pregnancy test before any DXA scan and not 
scanned if they are pregnant.  
 
There are no known risks associated with the EKG or the echocardiogram.  A subject 
must remove his or her shirt and have sticky pa tches applied to the hest for the 
electrocardiogram (EKG) and have gel applied for the echocardiogram. In some cases, 
chest hair may have to be shaved where the EKG patches are placed. If a structural 
abnormality is identified on an EKG  or echo, the subje ct would be given this information 
and referred to his or her own doctor for further evaluation . Subjects may feel lightheaded 
or short of breath during the pulmonary function tests, there is also a slight chance that 
individuals become dizzy and even fain t.

Abstract
The fifth revision  of the Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual  for Mental  Disorders  (DSM-5) includes in its 
research appendix  a potential new diagnosis—Internet  gaming  disorder  (IGD). This condition  primarily affects  
adolescent boys and young adult men, who rarely seek treatment on their own. More  often, parents express  
concerns about  their child’s  game  playing behaviors. This psychotherapy development study will evaluate  
feasibility and effect sizes of an intervention designed to help parents reduce  their child’s  gaming  problems;  the 
intervention allows for child participation, but it is geared toward parents, regardless of whether or not their 
child is willing  to participate. A total of 40 parents  concerned about  their child’s  gaming  behaviors will complete 
self and parental report inventories and structured diagnostic interviews regarding  gaming, substance  use and 
psychosocial functioning. Children who elect to participate will complete  parallel  versions of the instruments. 
Participants will be randomized to a control  condition consisting of referral  for mental health issues and family 
support services or to a 6-week behavioral intervention designed to assist  with better monitoring and regulating  
the child’s  game playing behaviors.  Gaming and other  problems  will be assessed pre-treatment, at the end of 
treatment and at a 4-month follow-up.  This study  will be the first to evaluate the reliability  and validity  of a 
parental version of the DSM-[ADDRESS_432024]  parents  in reducing their child’s gaming problems, and results will 
help guide future development  of interventions  for Internet gaming disorder.
Specific aims  
Internet gaming  disorder (IGD) is a condition included in the research appendix of the DSM-5. It affects 
about 1% of the general population, with adolescent and young adult males  most often impacted. This is a 
group that rarely seeks mental health  care. More commonly, parents express concerns about their child’s 
behavior.  Thus, this intervention  study  will be aimed  toward parents who are worried about their minor child’s 
or young adult  child’s  game playing. 
 We adapted principles  and theories applied in the context of family-based interventions for substance 
use disorders  toward Internet gaming  behaviors.  In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  40 parents who feel their child’s gaming  
behaviors are problematic will be recruited via ads to an intervention  study evaluating methods to assist  
parents in monitoring and reducing  their child’s game playing. Parents will complete instruments assessing  
perceptions of their child’s gaming, substance use, attention and conduct problems, and psychosocial 
functioning as well as about their own mental  health, family relationships and quality of life. Youth who agree  to 
participate will be administered instruments assessing similar constructs. Following the baseline  assessment, 
participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: referral  to community  support  services, or a 6-
week behavioral  intervention  in which they will meet weekly with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347660]’s 
game playing  behavior, restructure  the environment to be less conducive toward game playing, and reward 
non-game playing  behaviors.  Sessions  will also focus on improving parent-child  communication skills. The 
content is aimed toward parents,  but each session can be adapted to include children and young adults with 
gaming problems. Parents, along  with children who agree to participate,  will complete evaluations  post-
treatment and 2 months  later assessing  gaming playing  behaviors, substance  use and psychosocial 
functioning, family dynamics,  and indices of quality  of life. Specific aims are:

intervention who complete [ADDRESS_432025] size of the intervention  for reducing gaming. Parental  reports of their child’s  
frequencies and durations of game  playing behaviors will be compared  over time between  conditions to 
establish effect size estimates.

Version 5/[ADDRESS_432026] majority of children, along with many young adults, play video  or electronic games.  A nationally 
representative study of US youth between the ages of 8 and 18 found that 88% played games electronically, 
and 68% played  at least weekly  and 23% daily (Gentile, 2009). Although most videogame playing is harmless, 
excessive play can lead to psychosocial and even medical problems, with reports  of game-induced seizures 
and even deaths (Chuang,  2006;  BBC News; Reuters).  Although  very few cases  rise to these extremes, 
governments of some Asian  countries have declared excessive game playing to reach near epi[INVESTIGATOR_11422], and treatment clinics  have  been  established around  the world,  including  the US.  
            Despi[INVESTIGATOR_347661], there is no officially recognized  diagnosis  for this condition. 
The 5th revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; APA, 2013) includes 
Internet gaming  disorder (IGD) in Section 3, “Conditions for Further Study.” Classification in future  versions  of 
the DSM will require data regarding reliability  and validity of diagnosis,  comorbidity with other psychiatric  
conditions, biological  mechanisms, as well as information about the natural progression and recovery from this 
condition, and its treatment.  This  pi[INVESTIGATOR_347662], with the aim of 
gathering data to support larger scale grant applications related  to this condition.  
         The DSM-5 lists nine criteria  for IGD, adapted from substance  use and addictive disorders, and an 
international group (Petry et al., 2014) suggests  their operationalization. Studies have  begun  to evaluate  their 
reliability and validity.  Ko et al. (2014) administered clinical interviews based on the DSM-5 criteria to three 
groups of young adults in Taiwan:  persons  with current gaming problems; persons with past but not current 
problems; and persons  who never had gaming problems. Meeting [ADDRESS_432027] distinguished 
individuals with “normal” levels of play from those who had experienced clinically significant harms,  and the 
specific criteria  had adequate to good  diagnostic accuracy.  Rehbein  et al. (2015) developed  a screening 
instrument, the Video  Game Dependency  Scale (VGDS), based on the DSM-5 criteria and administered it to 
11,003 ninth-grade students  in [LOCATION_013]. Those who endorsed 5 or more  criteria evidenced  significantly  more 
impairment in school and sleep problems  that those who did not. Students who responded affirmatively  to “give 
up other activities” and “tolerance” symptoms were  most likely  to meet  5 IGD criteria whereas denying “give up 
other activities” and “withdrawal”  essentially ruled  out IGD, suggesting these criteria are particularly relevant. 
This study  will be the first to evaluate the psychometric  properties of a parental version of the VGDS,  and it will 
also be the first to evaluate concordance between  parent and child reports of symptoms and diagnosis.  
Risk factors
Although understanding of IGD is in its early  stages, male gender  is clearly a risk factor. No matter how 
IGD is defined  all studies find higher rates in males than females (Desai et al., 2010; Choo et al., 2010; 
Mentzoni et al., 2011).  In the DSM-5 based  evaluation of IGD in German  adolescents (Rehbein et al., 2015), 
2.0% of males  were  classified with the condition versus  0.3% of females.  Younger  age is consistently 
associated with gaming as well.  Using less stringent  classification systems,  Festl et al. (2011) found  that youth  
under 19 years had a 7.6% prevalence rate of gaming  problems, and for those 20 years and older rates  were 
3.7%. Mentzoni et al. (2011) noted  that 15.4% of males  aged 16-21 years, and 9.7% of males aged  22-27, had 
gaming problems, while rates in all other  age and gender groups were  under 3%. 
Depression and social isolation  appear related to IGD. In cross sectional studies, persons with gaming  
problems have higher rates of depression than those  without (Desai et al., 2010; Mentzoni et al., 2011; van 
Rooij  et al., 2010). Low sociability  and social competence  also correlate with gaming problems (Festl et al., 
2011; Lemmens  et al., 2009; Rehbein et al., 2010). Lo et al. (2005)  surveyed  174 Taiwanese  college-age 
online game  players and found that quality  of interpersonal relationships decreased, and social anxiety IRB Review

Version 5/20                               Page 3 of 11intensified, as game playing increased. Romer et al. (2013)  found that heavy  game playing was associated  
with an increase in depression over time, and that greater depression also predicted more  game  playing as 
well as withdrawal from sports and other organized activities in over 700 US youth. 
 Gaming problems are also linked to impulsivity and Attention Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD; 
Choo et al., 2010; Gentile,  2009; Rehbein et al., 2010). In a prospective study, Swing et al. (2010) evaluated 
gaming and attention problems in over 1,[ADDRESS_432028] on IGD and substance use. In a survey  of nearly 2000 game players, Porter  et 
al. (2010) found no differences between those with and without gaming problems in terms of alcohol use, but 
persons with gaming problems were more  likely  to use illicit drugs. In high school students, Desai et al. (2010)  
also found that alcohol use did not differ based on gaming  problems, but use of nicotine  and illicit drugs other 
than marijuana was more  common in problem gamers. Walther et al. (2012) evaluated substance  use, and 
game playing  in over [ADDRESS_432029] of substance use disorders and ADHD, and it 
may play a role in development  and/or maintenance of IGD and has been linked with its neurobiology as well 
(e.g., Chen  et al., 2014; Han et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2015; Ko et al. 2013, 2105).  
In sum, psychological  symptoms  are likely involved in the development and maintenance of IGD. 
However, these studies only reported  upon  natural changes in IGD that occur over time. They  did not address  
how treatment may impact changes in gaming  or other problems. 
Treatments
Reviews of treatment for IGD (King et al., 2011;  Winkler et al., 2013) note that few randomized  trials 
exist. Most  interventions  involve intensive  multi-modal therapy provided in the context of residential care (Cash  
et al., 2012; Rumpf  et al., in press; Koo et al., 2011;  Shek et al., 2009). Young  (2007)  uses  more focused  
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat individuals  with Internet problems more generally in an outpatient  
setting. Of [ADDRESS_432030] reduced  symptoms by [CONTACT_941] 8th session, and 
improvements were  maintained throughout a 6-month  follow-up. 
   In one of the few randomized trials,  Du et al. (2010) assigned  56 youth from Shanghai to 8 sessions of 
a group-based CBT or a no treatment control condition.  Internet use decreased similarly in both groups, but 
those assigned to CBT evidenced improvements in time management skills and reductions in psychosocial 
symptoms relative to those in the control condition. Jager et al. (2012) describe an ongoing study in [LOCATION_013].  
It will compare  CBT, involving  individual and group therapy for four months, to a wait-list control condition. Up 
to [ADDRESS_432031] large scale randomized  study of treatment for Internet addiction,  but it is not limited  to 
gaming, which  may differ substantially  from Internet addiction more  generally (Petry et al., 2013, 2014).  
As in other populations with addictive disorders, few youth or young  adults seek treatment on their own 
(Alegria et al., 2011; Hardoon et al., 2003; SAMHSHA  2009ab). More often, parents express concerns about  
their child’s behaviors, and many  treatments  for IGD include a family component. Therefore, this study will 
focus on parents,  with family sessions involving the youth  encouraged  but not required. Data  suggest that 
parents can have strong influences on children’s game  playing. For example, allowing videogame systems in a 
child’s bedroom is associated with more frequent playing  (Roberts & Foehr, 2008) and greater use of violent 
and mature-rated  games  (Olson et al., 2007). Parental guidelines related to playing  time are also inversely 
associated with excessive  game  playing.  Carlson  et al. (2010) surveyed 7,415 youth and their parents  and 
found that youth  who reported  their parents had specific  and well-defined rules regarding  playing were less 
likely to play excessively than those  who reported  their parents had no such rules; likewise,  parents who 
indicated they had firm limits noted their children were  less likely play excessively than parents without clear 
limits. In addition, frequent monitoring of behaviors  is associated with improved outcomes along  a number of 
dimensions (Michie  et al., 2012;  Steinberg et al., 2013),  and this intervention  teaches  parents to monitor their 
child’s game  playing behavior. It will also assist  parents in restructuring their home environment to be less 
conducive toward  game playing, and it will provide communication skills training to encourage and set clear  
expectations about game playing  behaviors. Borrowing from effective behaviorally  based  family based 
substance abuse  interventions for adolescents  and young adults (Stanger  et al., 2009;  Waldron  et al., 2007),  
this behavioral treatment  also encourages methods to provide positive contingencies for non-game  playing IRB Review

intervention for reducing gaming and related problems and improving family functioning. 
Innovation: This study is innovative on several levels.  It will be the first to evaluate psychometric properties of 
a parental version  of the DSM-[ADDRESS_432033] randomized trial 
specifically for IGD. Based on the premises that parents can modify  the child’s environment to be less 
conducive toward  game playing and more  encouraging of non-gaming  behaviors  and that children are unlikely 
to seek treatment on their own, the study  is directed toward parents. This study  will provide unique  and 
valuable information  on the nature, course,  and treatment of this putative new addictive disorder. 
Approach
Subjects will be recruited  by [CONTACT_347679], e.g., “Worried about how much  your child plays 
videogames?” Parents  who call will be informed that the study specifically relates  to an intervention directed  
toward parents,  with child involvement encouraged but not required.  
Inclusion criteria are: (1) parent/guardian  of a 10-22 year old residing in the same  household >8 months/year; 
and (2) reports the child plays videogames  >15 hours/week on average  and that the playing has caused 
significant problems  in the family or with the child’s school or work.
Exclusion criteria are: (1) parent or child has a significant other  mental health condition  that may impact 
response to this treatment  (suicidality,  psychotic disorder); (2) parent is unavailable to attend 6 weekly 
sessions over the next 8 weeks; or (3) parent is currently  receiving (or has received in the past 3 months) 
psychosocial support related to parenting or family  counseling. 
Child age range spans early  adolescence  to young  adulthood. Although  broad, 22-year olds still living  
at home  over half the year (to allow for visitation for divorced parents, overnight camps,  etc., but not college 
students living away from home)  are likely  financially dependent  on parents, rendering  the intervention  
relevant. The minimal  gaming time is less than the average reported  of persons with gaming problems (24 
hours/week), but higher than the national average  of about 12 hours/week  in youth (Gentile, 2009). We elected 
not to require the child meet  DSM-[ADDRESS_432034]  report that “significant problems”  have  arisen to ensure some  level of difficulties.  
Informed consent.  Parents who call in response  to ads and appear eligible based  upon responses to a phone 
screen will be invited to an in-person assessment. They  will be told their child can also attend, but child 
attendance is not mandatory for study participation. At the in-person assessment, we will obtain written 
informed consent.  One or two parents can participate,  and if both are included, both will sign consent and 
complete assessments  independently. Children  <18 years may (or may choose  not to) provide  assent  to 
participate, and those  >[ADDRESS_432035] to participate. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, consent  may be conducted remotely via video conference.  Consent  
documents and assessment packets will be sent to potential participants so that they may review  the consent 
prior to the video  call. A research assistant will review the consent  documents  with the potential  participant(s) 
over video conference,  and the consenter and participant will sign the document.  The RA will witness the 
participant’s signature [CONTACT_347682]. The participant  will send back  the document (through mail, email,  or fax), 
which will be joined  with the copy signed by [CONTACT_347680].  Assent will be collected  the same  way. Proof of a 
LAR is unlikely, but if needed proof  of LAR will be shown through  video and sent back  with signed consent 
form. We are requesting to waive the need for an individual to witness the person obtaining  consent  during 
COVID in order to keep  person to person contact  [CONTACT_6398]. We are also requesting to waive  the lapse period 
between the consent being  signed and receiving  the physical copy back from the participant in order  not to 
delay research further. We request that once  the consent document is signed (and witnessed by [CONTACT_347681]), the participant may begin the assessments and randomization process. 
Assessment packets with self-report measures  will be mailed to participants to fill out and return via mail, or 
completed via phone/video if requested by [CONTACT_2299]. Assessments that are not self-report  will be 
completed with the research assistant via phone/video. IRB Review

B. Behavioral therapy. This intervention will be administered in 6 individual and/or  family sessions (depending  
on child’s willingness  to participate), the contents  of which are outlined in Petry (under review). Session 1 will 
focus on reviewing  information  collected  at baseline and orienting  the parent (and child,  when applicable) to 
treatment. Parents will be reminded that although  they cannot  prevent playing games  entirely, they can learn to 
better understand why their child is playing. Through  this process they may alter their own reactions toward 
playing, which in turn may decrease the extent to which their child plays and the problems arising  from it.

Data Analyses. We will evaluate potential baseline differences between  groups despi[INVESTIGATOR_347673], 
and any that exist that may relate to outcome will be used as covariates or fixed factors.   Analysis will be 
conducted on an intent-to-treat basis,  using all randomly assigned subjects. Both during treatment (baseline to 
post-treatment) and longer-term (month 4) efficacy  will be evaluated.
Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention,  the proportion of parents assigned to the 
intervention who complete  6 sessions will be examined, as will the proportion of youth who attend the 
sessions. Parent and child ratings of satisfaction  with the intervention  will be assessed. 
Aim 2: To examine  the effect size of the intervention on reducing gaming, parental reports  of proportion of days 
on which their child played games and durations of game playing will be compared  between conditions, 
controlling for baseline  indices. These  are continuous measures,  with missing data likely. Hierarchial linear 
models (HLM; Gibbons et al., 1993)  will analyze differences  between  groups over time. These analyses have 
advantages over repeated measures as they estimate missing data via model parameter estimates and use 
real time, as opposed  to scheduled time, of assessments.  Analyses  will be conducted for both short  and long-
term effects. The model will include factors representing group (using contrasts above), time, and the 
interaction of group  by [CONTACT_5586], along  with any important covariates. 
Exploratory aims are to assess the effect size of the intervention on secondary outcomes including  CBCL  
scores, family communication, psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Using  similar HLM analyses  as 
outlined above  we will compare  groups  over time on these indices. 
Power analyses.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_347674]. Twenty  subjects per group 
are sufficient to assess effect sizes,  and if medium or larger  effect sizes are noted, subsequent larger scale 
psychotherapy development trials will be proposed to evaluate  short  and long-term efficacy of this intervention.  
Data quality control/exploratory analyses: Instruments chosen for this study  are reliable and valid for 
assessing psychosocial  problems and gaming behavior, although the parental  version  of the VGDS  is new. 
Careful training  of evaluators will precede  study initiation, and assessment interviews will be audiotaped  and

will be compared using Kappa's for diagnostic  assessments,  and Shrout and Fleiss  intraclass  correlations for 
continuous variables. We expect  most  children will participate, with >[ADDRESS_432042] of its kind.  It will lead 
to a therapy  manual and specify  procedures  for monitoring therapy delivery and evaluating  potential  
mechanisms of change  for parents of children  with the condition.  Using  established methods of psychotherapy 
development (Rounsaville et al., 2000), we will determine the initial feasibility and effect  size of this behavioral 
intervention. This work will also guide  further  development of assessment instruments for IGD. This study 
holds potential to pave the way for future research evaluating the biological underpi[INVESTIGATOR_347675], as well as its treatment.

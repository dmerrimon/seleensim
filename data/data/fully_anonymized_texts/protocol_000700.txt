HIS AMENDS VERSION [ADDRESS_1178166] 15 2015 INTRODUCES ADDITIONA L 
SENSIT
IVITY ANALYSES AS REQUESTED BY [CONTACT_847387]. 
INTRODUCTION
 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_34212] a novel, orally active, selective inhibitor of the coagulation factor Xa (FXa) 
developed by [CONTACT_414]-Myers Squibb (BMS) and [COMPANY_007] as an anticoagulant and antithrombotic 
agent. Api[INVESTIGATOR_34212] a reversible and highly potent inhibitor of human FXa with a high degree of 
selectivity over other coagulation proteases and structurally related enzymes involved in 
digestion and fibrinolysis.  
2.1. Study Design 
This i
s a randomized, active controlled, parallel-group, open label study. Approximately 1500 
subjec
ts will be randomized 1:1 to api[INVESTIGATOR_334480] (parenteral heparin and/or oral 
anticoagulat
ion with Vitamin K antagonist (excluding other novel oral anticoagulants)). 
Following ra
ndomization, endpoints will be collected during the [ADDRESS_1178167] randomization if cardioversion is not performed within 
that time
 frame. 
A schematic diagram below (Figure 1) shows the design of the study:

2.2. Study Objectives and Endpoints 
The study objective is to assess the occurrence of clinical endpoints in non-valvular AF 
subjects (i.e., without rheumatic mitral valve disease, a prosthetic mechanical heart valve, or 
mitral valve
 repair) indicated for early cardioversion and treated with api[INVESTIGATOR_334480] 
(parenteral heparin and/or oral anticoagulation with Vitamin K antagonist (excluding other 
NOACs)). 
Clinical Endpoints 
 Stroke.  
  Systemic embolism. 
  Major Bleeding. 
  Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding. 
  All cause death. 
Additional information will also be collected on: 
 Cardioversion details: timing, type, attempts, and rhythm status   
 Length of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
 Use of image guidance e.g., TEE/TOE or CT. 
This pr
otocol will use independent adjudication of disease-related clinical endpoints.  
3. INTERIM ANALYSES, FINAL ANALYSES AND UNBLINDING 
This study will use an Independent Review Committee (IRC) independent of the sponsor study 
team.  The IRC, in collaboration with the sponsor ([COMPANY_007]/BMS)  and the Executive Committee 
will
 create a Charter including the interim analysis plan .  
 
090177e18d7f2098\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:11-Jan-2018 08:41 (GMT)
Protocol B0661025/CV185- [ADDRESS_1178168] of the 
study will be forwarded to Executive Committee and the sponsor ([COMPANY_007]/BMS) for final decision. 
The sponsor will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of 
endpoint events and of safety data which are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as 
appropriate. 
 
The final a
nalysis will be executed after the database release. 
4. HYPOTHESES AND DECISION RUL ES 
4.1. S
tatistical Hypotheses 
This is a de
scriptive study, and there is no formal pre-defined hypothesis testing.  
Baseline demographics, endpoints, AEs and SAEs will be reported as per [COMPANY_007]/BMS reporting 
standards and consistent with the therapeutic area standards. Number of observations and 
proportions will be given for categorical or binary variables, number of observations, mean, 
standard deviation, median minimum and maximum will be given for continuous variables; time-
to-event data will be displayed using Kaplan-Meier techniques; hazard ratio will be calculated.  
4.2. Statistical Decision Rules 
No dec
ision rules will be set, this is a descriptive study. 
5. ANALYSIS SETS 
Adverse events and adjudicated bleeding endpoints (Major Bleeding and Clinically Relevant 
Non-Major Bleeding) will be reported based on the Safety Analysis set. All other data will be 
reported based on the Full Analysis Set as-randomized (using a strict intent- to-treat criterion), 
irrespective of the actual treatment or compliance. 
5.1. Full Analysis Set 
The 
Full Analysis Set contains all randomized subjects. It will be used under the intent to treat 
principle (subjects will be categorized to the treatment group to which they were assigned by [CONTACT_152472], regardless of the treatment actually received). 
5.2. ‘Per Protocol ’ Analysis Set  
N/A 
090177e18d7f2098\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:11-Jan-2018 08:41 (GMT)
Protocol B0661025/CV185- 267 Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 8 5.3. Safety Analysis Set 
The Safety Analysis Set (as-treated) will consist of all treated subjects (randomized subjects who 
received at least one dose of study drug). For the purpose of safety analyses, subjects will be 
categorized according to the treatment received; subject that received both treatments will be 
counted as apix
aban. The reporting will be done as per [COMPANY_007]/BMS reporting standards and BMS 
CT SOP 109
. 
5.4. Other Analysis Sets 
Pre
vention-evaluable analyses datasets will be created in order to exclude subjects identified at 
visit 2 through imaging as already having a thrombus; if multiple evaluations took place over 
time for a subject, only the first one will be used. 
The Full Prevention-Evaluable Analysis Set is obtained by [CONTACT_847388]-positive subjects 
from the Full Analysis Set. The Safety Prevention-Evaluable Analysis Set is obtained by 
[CONTACT_847389]. The sets of Thrombus Positive-
Full Analysis Set and Thrombus Positive-Safety are the complements of the Full Prevention 
Evaluable and Safety Prevention-evaluable subjects. 
The Modified Full Analys is Set is the subset of the Full Analysis Set of subjects that received at 
least one study drug dose. 
5.5. Treatment Missallocations 
N/A 
5.6. Protocol Deviations 
All significant protocol deviations including eligibility deviations, use of prohibited concomitant 
medicati
ons,  subjects receiving the incorrect study drug, or other deviations-as deemed 
significa
nt by [CONTACT_847390] (either from the project database or RightrackII) 
prior to database release, then listed and summarized by [CONTACT_847391]. The Clinical team will provide before the database lock a 
list of prohibited medications.

 L
ow Left Ventricular Function (≤40%),  
 Diabetes (Yes/No),  
 Duration of Arrhythmia (in hours) 
 No im
putation for missing data will be made on these covariates.  
We will
 explore the effect of the above-mentioned covariates on all the clinical endpoints. 
Univ ariate analyses (one predictor at a time) and multivariate analyses (including all covariates 
from above 
and treatment effect) will be performed for the above mentioned covariates on each 
of the cli
nical endpoints using Cox proportional hazards models. Interaction tests between 
covariates and allocated treatment will be conducted.

Page 10 7. HANDLING OF MISSING VALUES 
Sa
fety data will be handled according to the BMS safety data conventions (described in 
“Analysis of Safety Data - Reference to BMS CT SOP 109”. This document includes 
de
scriptions on how to analyze AE data as well as how to handle partial dates, missing dates, and 
unknown end dates when analyzing safety data. 
For the analyses of clinical endpoints, imputation of missing or partial dates for efficacy and 
bleeding 
events will follow the convention outlined in “Analysis of Safety Data - Reference to 
BMS C
T SOP 109”.

8.1.3 Analyses for Binary Endpoints 
For binar
y endpoints, 95% exact confidence intervals of each event rate will be reported by 
[CONTACT_847392]. The relative risk (risk ratios) will also be reported. In the SAS language we will 
use the REL
RISK with FMSCORE method option in the EXACT statement of PROC FREQ in 
order to pr
ovide exact unconditional confidence limits for the relative risk.  
Other binar
y data comparisons will be made using Fisher’s exact test.

Sa
fety data will be analyzed according to the BMS safety data conventions (described in 
“Analysis of Safety Data - Reference to BMS CT SOP 109”.  
8.2.4. Anal
yses of Clinical Endpoints 
 Stroke
. 
  Systemic embolism. 
  Major Bleeding. 
  Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding. 
  All cause death. 
The foll
owing time periods will be defined for reporting clinical endpoints: 
 Pre-cardioversion 
 Post-cardioversion 
 ALL: entire duration (include 30 days follow-up after cardioversion ). 
The c
haracterization of stroke, systemic embolism and death will be done based on the 
adjudicated endpoints during the study (according to an intention- to-treat paradigm). Analysis of 
these endpoints will be based on the full analysis set. 
The c
haracterization of bleeding will be done with a focus on adjudicated major bleeding and 
clinically relevant non-major bleeding during the treatment period (according to a safety 
paradigm). Analysis of these endpoints will be based on the safety analysis set.   
The clinic
al endpoint summaries will include descriptive statistics of individual event rates and 
their exact 95% confidence intervals ; however exact risk ratios and corresponding p-values 
comparin
g the treatment arms will also be presented without any formal testing.   
Sensitivity analysis: If the TEE/TOE or CT procedures will identify subjects with thrombus 
(thrombus-positive), sensitivity analyses of all clinical endpoints will be run on a dataset 
obtained by [CONTACT_847393]. The dataset from which 
thrombus-positive (as per investigator’s assessment) subjects were excluded will be labeled as 
Full Prevention-Evaluable; its complementary set of Thrombus Positive-ITT will be analyzed for 
the endpoints of Stroke, Systemic Embolism, and Death. Sensitivity analyses of bleeding events 
will a
lso be run on a dataset (labeled as Safety Prevention-Evaluable Analysis Set) obtained by 
[CONTACT_847394] (as pe r investigator’s assessment) from Safety analysis set; its 
complementary set of Thrombus Positive-Safety will be analyzed for the bleeding endpoints. 
The Modified Full Analysis set will be analyzed for the endpoints of Stroke, Systemic 
Embolism, and Death.

Page 12 Subgroup analyses: Clinical endpoints and safety (AEs, SAEs) will be reported for each 
subgroup of interest. Subgroups of interest are (please note that bleeding endpoints are based on 
the safety analysis set while the others are based on the full analysis set): 
 “Early Cardioversion” (defined as cardioversion that occurs within 7 days from 
randomization),  
 Image Guidance (TEE/TOE or CT),  
 age (< 65 years old, ≥ 65 years old )  
 gender.  
 F
or the clinical endpoints (stroke/embolism/death), also analyze by (first) cardioversion 
status: ‘
Interventional cardioversion’, no cardioversion, or ‘Spontaneous cardioversion’ 
 For clinical endpoints, breakdown summaries by [CONTACT_293096][INVESTIGATOR_847382] (loading 
dose vs. no loading dose) will be produced. 
We will
 display graphically the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimators of the time to  
• Composite of  first adjudicated stroke or systemic embolism, 
• F
irst Major bleeding event, 
• C
omposite of first major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding  
• All ca

8.2.5. Other analyses: 
The f
ull analysis set will be used to summarize data on cardioversion details, length of in-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_847383]. 
 
 Cardioversion details will be summarized by [CONTACT_847395] (a separate table will be 
prese
nted for each number of attempts). 
 
o The summary for first attempt will be based on the full analysis set. Timing of 
cardioversion will be the time from randomization to the first attempt only, with time 
to first attempt censored at the last day of follow-up if an attempt has not been made.  
o The hazards ratio (and p-value) will be calculated for time from randomization to the 
first attempt
 at cardioversion, comparing image guided to non-image guided subjects. 
o The second attempt will be summarized based on the subset of the full analysis set 
that already had the first cardioversion, etc.

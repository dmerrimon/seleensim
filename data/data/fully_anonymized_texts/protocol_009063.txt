1. Clarify implications of rescue therapy prior to [ADDRESS_216585] and address FDA considerations  on enrollment.  19th June  2015  
CIP 002 Revision 04 Update to remove reference to “target ” in definition of rescue 
therapy and to amend the inclusion 10. To use imaging for all 
timepoints and amend exclusion criteria to exclude pt.s with severe 
hypertension.  10th March 2016 
CIP002 Revision 05 Update to in clude a new size of EmboTrap device. Now includes 
sizes (5×21 mm and 5 ×33 mm). 
Increase the maximum patient enrolment allowed in the study from 210 to 228 throughout the protocol. This accounts for the potential 
increase in number of “ roll-in” patients in the study based on the 
number of US study sites. The evaluable cohort required, 176, 
remains the same.  28th June 2016

Page 10 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
Duration of  Subject 
Participation  Subjects will be on study for up to 90 (±14)  days.  
Neurological assessment: 168 hours (± 12 hours) / 7 days or  discharge 
(whichever occurs  first)  
Last Follow -up: 90 (±14)  days  
Primary  Efficacy 
Endpoint  The primary efficacy  endpoint of the study is revascularization  measured 
using modified Thrombolysis in Cerebrovascular Infarction (mTICI  inclusive 
of the 2c rating). Successful achievement of the endpoint is defined  as 
achieving an mTICI score of 2b or greater in the target vessel following 3  or 
less passes of the EmboTrap  device.  
Primary  Safety 
endpoint  The primary safety endpoint will be measured as the occurrence  of 
Symptomatic Intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) within 24 hours ( -8/+12  hrs) 
post -procedure, together with any other Serious Adverse Device  Effects 
(excluding those already counted in  sICH).  
Secondary 
Endpoints  • Good  clinical  outcome  – judged  to be an mRS  score  of ≤2 at 90(+/ -14) 
days.  
• Time to treat – defined as the time from groin puncture to  visualization 
of the final angiographic  result.  
• All procedure -related mortality at day [ADDRESS_216593] -procedure and  all-cause 
mortality at 90(+/ -7) days  post -procedure.  
• Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE).  
• Procedure Related Serious Adverse Events  (PRSAE).  
• Symptomatic ICH  (sICH).  
• Neurological deterioration – defined by [CONTACT_139648] 4 points or  more 
on the NIHSS score, at the 24 -hour time  point.  
• Evidence of Infarction of a previously uninvolved vascular territory,  as 
evaluated from 24 -hour imaging  (CT/MRI).  
Statistics  The primary  efficacy endpoint of the study will be tested using a  non- 
inferiority hypothesis for successful revascularization with the  EmboTrap 
against a composite Performance Goal derived from a Bayesian  meta - 
analysis of adjudicated trial data for similar devices.  
All mTICI outcomes and their proportions will be  reported.  
The primary safety endpoint and the secondary endpoints will not be  tested 
but will be examined using confidence intervals to calculate the  relevant 
population  parameter.  
The primary safety endpoi nt will be the rate of sICH together with  SADEs 
(excluding those already counted in  sICH).  
  
Page 11 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 Secondary endpoints that will be reported using descriptive  statistics 
include:  
• Clinical outcome at 90  days  
• Time to  treat  
• Mortality post -procedure – All procedure -related  mortality  
• Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
• Procedure Related Serious Adverse Events  (PRSAE)  
• Symptomatic ICH  (sICH)  
• Neurological deterioration  
• Evidence of Infarction in a previously uninvolved  territory  
 The study will also perform subgroup analyses on the cohort based on: 
• Specific vascular location of the occlusion (i.e. intracranial ICA, carotid T/L, proximal M1/ distal M1 /M2, VA, BA  etc.)  
• Technique of treatment as described  below:  
− Use of a balloon guide vs. no balloon  guide  
− Use o f an intermediate catheter vs. no intermediate  catheter.

1 Introduction  
 
The large  vessels  of the brain  include  the Internal  Carotid  Artery  (ICA),  Middle  Cerebral Artery 
(MCA), Vertebral Artery  (VA),  and the Basilar Artery  (BA).  Occlusion  of these  large  arteries  in 
ischemic stroke is associated with significant disability and mortality. Revascularization  of 
intracranial artery occlusions is the therapeutic goal in stroke  therapy.  
Endovascular mechanical revascularization (thrombectomy) is an increasingly used method  for 
intracranial large vessel recanalization in acute stroke. Currently, a number of mechanical 
recanalization  devices  are in clinical  use. First  generation  devices  included  the Merci  Retriever 
device. Newer devices based on stent -like technology, referred to as “stentrievers” or  “stent- 
retrievers”, are currently displacing these first generation thrombectomy devices  for 
recanalization in acute ischemic  stroke.  
The EmboTrap®  Revascularization  Device (hereafter  referred  to as the EmboTrap  device)  has been 
developed and CE approved for this indication in Europe. The EmboTrap device is approved  for 
use in the US strictly  within  the confines  of the ARISE  II IDE Study.  It is indicated  for use in the 
anterior  and posterior  neurovasculature  in vessels  such  as the internal carotid  artery,  the M1 and 
M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery, the vertebral artery, and the basilar artery.  
 
1.1 Background  
1.1.1 Intra -arterial  thrombolytics  
Currently, IV lytics  are used  in Europe  and the United  States  for patients  presenting up to 4.5 
hours  after symptom  onset.  Although  in the US they  are only  FDA approved  for use in patients 
presenting up to 3 hours after symptom onset, US national clinical practice guidelines  [1] 
recommend  administering  IV lytics  in the 3-4.5h  window  to those  patients  who  meet  the ECASS 3 
trial inclusion/exclusion criteria [2]. 
In addition to time constraints, IV thrombolytic therapy has been demonstrated to be  less 
effective  in recanalizing  proximal  occlusions  of large  vessels, such  as the ICA and MCA.  Since  a 
large  percentage of strokes  presenting at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183325],  this is an important 
clinical challenge to address. Additionally, not all patients may be treated with  thrombolytic 
therapy,  and so mechanical  thrombectomy  is a valuable  alternative  in patients  contraindicated  to 
t-PA or where t -PA treatment was not  effective.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_216598] is used to  exclude 
hemorrhagic stroke, and CTA (CT Angiography) is used to confirm Large -Vessel Occlusion. 
Additional imaging assessment, such as use of MRI and/or CT Perfusion, varies by [CONTACT_384]. Since 
the recent presentations  of clinical results  from  the MR. CLEAN,  ESCAPE,  SWIFT  PRIME  and 
Extend -IA studies,  centers  have  adopted  a bridging approach  to treatment – immediately  starting 
an IV dose  of lytics,  then  transferring  the patient  to the angiography  suite  of a comprehensive  
  
Page 16 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   stroke center  as quickly  as possible  to speed  the time  to intra- arterial intervention,  if needed. 
Bridging therapy should occur as determined appropriate by [CONTACT_183355].  
1.1.3 Ethical considerations - Europe  
The EmboTrap device is a CE -marked, approved device. It will only be used at the  physician’s 
discretion  and for its indicated  use in line with  the instructions  for use. The collection  and analysis 
of the data  requires  ethical  approval;  however,  the use of the EmboTrap  device  under  this trial 
protocol  in Europe  does  not introduce  any new  ethical  concerns  beyond those  present  when 
treating any acute stroke patient with an approved mechanical thrombectomy  device.  
1.1.4 Ethical considerations – United  States  
The EmboTrap  device  is not FDA cleared  in the US. It is an investigational device  that may  be used 
in the U.S. within  the confines  of the ARISE  II IDE Study.  The purpose  of this study  is to gather 
information on device performance to support an application for clearance to  FDA.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_216599]  data  on subjects in a prospective  manner;  all patients 
who  meet  all Inclusion/Exclusion  criteria will be included in the analysis. Coded  patient  data  in the 
form of angiographic and CT and/or MRI images, and completed case report forms are  required 
in order to assess the study endpoints. Informed consent will be sought from the subject or  their 
legal representative for participation and to give permission for the sponsor and  subcontractors  
(CRO, CEC, DSMB, and Adjudicating core lab) to have access to these  data.  
Physicians should follow local practice guidance’s, their own routine best practice, and  the 
EmboTrap device instructions for use when participating in the  study.

The device  is de signed  for use in the anterior  and posterior neurovasculature  in vessels such  as the 
internal carotid  artery,  the M1 and M2 segments  of the middle  cerebral artery,  the vertebral  
artery,  and the basilar arteries.  It is intended  for use by [CONTACT_183356] - 
interventional catheterization and the treatment of ischemic stroke, and is  delivered 
endovascularly  under  fluoroscopic  guidance  in a similar  manner  to that of other  neurovascular 
clot-retrieval systems. Once  across  the site of vessel  occlusion,  the stent -like element  of the 
device is deployed to entrap the clot and allow it to be retrieved, hence restoring blood  flow.

The device is available in two lengths, [ADDRESS_216601] the same outside 
diameter, size differences relate to the length of the stent-like portion. The device comprises a 
three-dimensional Nitinol retrievable stent-like assembly mounted on the distal end of a 
tapered (guidewire-like), PTFE-coated Nitinol shaft, as shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
 
Figure 1: The EmboTrap device  
 
The EmboTrap device is supplied preloaded within  an insertion tool – a transparent, PTFE tube 
incorporating a spi[INVESTIGATOR_183326] (Figure 2) . In use, the physician inserts the insertion tool 
into the hub of a pre-positioned microcatheter and advances the EmboTrap device forward out 
of the insertion tool and into the microcatheter. Th e spi[INVESTIGATOR_183327]-load the device for an additional pass.

Figure 2: An illustration of the Insertion Tool used for loading the EmboTrap device.  
 
Two silver-colored indicator bands (Figure 1) on the proximal portion of the device shaft (i.e. two 
sections of the Nitinol shaft which are not coated with PTFE), represent an important feature of 
the device design as they provide a visual and tactile reference point to the physician that the 
stent-like portion of the device is nearing the end of the microcatheter, thereby [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_183328]. For 
example, using a standard microcatheter (total length of 155cm and a 7cm Rotating Hemostasis 
Valve (RHV)), the EmboTrap device tip will be approximately 8cm from the distal end of the 
microcatheter when the first silver band on the EmboTrap shaft approaches the RHV. When 
the second silver band on the EmboTrap shaft appr oaches the RHV, the device tip will be nearing 
the distal end of the microcatheter. A further benefit of this feature is that it allows the physician 
to minimize the exposure of the patient to X-rays , as he/she can avoid using fluoroscopic guidance 
until the indicator bands demonstrate the device’s proximity to the end of the microcatheter.

[ADDRESS_216602] associated clinical outcomes in a manner 
that facilitates  relevant  comp arison  of outputs  with  that of devices  approved  in the U.S. for 
clearing Large Vessel Occlusions.  
 
3.1 Primary  endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is revascularization measured using  modified 
Thrombolysis in Cerebrovascular Infarction (mTICI inclusive of the 2c rating).  Successful 
achievement of the endpoint is defined as achieving a mTICI score of 2b or greater in the  target 
vessel, following 3 or less passes of the EmboTrap  device.  
The primary  safety  endpoint  will be measured  as the occurrence  of Symptomatic  Intracerebral  
hemorrhage (sICH) within 24 hours ( -8/+12 hrs) post -procedure, together with any other  Serious 
Adverse Device Effects (excluding those already counted in  sICH).  
 
3.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Clinical outcome at 90 days – A good clinical outcome will be judged to be an mRS score of ≤2  at 
90(+/ -14) days.  
Procedure Time  is defined  as the time  from  groin  puncture  to achievement of ≥mTICI II b, or if 
not achieved, final  angiogram.  
Time to treat is defined as the time from angiographic visualization of large vessel occlusion to  
achievement  of ≥mTICI II b or if not achieved,  final angiogram.  The number  of passes to get to 
mTICI 2b or greater flow will also be  recorded.  
Mortality  post -procedure – All procedure -related  mortality  (i.e. directly  traceable  to a procedure - 
related  SAE)  at Day [ADDRESS_216603] -procedure  and all-cause  mortality  at 90(+/ -7) days  post -procedure.  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) is where the EmboTrap device caused, or cannot be  ruled 
out as having caused,  an effect  that has resulted  in any of the consequences  characteristic  of a 
serious adverse  event.  
Procedure Related Serious Adverse Events (PRSAE) is where the interventional  procedure 
caused,  or can not  be ruled  out as having  caused,  an effect  that has resulted  in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse  event.  
Symptomatic ICH (sICH) is an y extravascular blood in the brain or within the cranium  associated 
with  clinical deterioration,  as defined  by [CONTACT_183357] 4 points  or more  in the score  on the NIHSS, 
or that leads to death and is identified as the predominant cause of the neurologic  deterioration 
[3]. For the purpose  of data  analysis,  subjects  with  sICH  identified  through  all post –treatment 
scans up to the 24 hour timepoint (including those performed due to clinical deterioration),  will 
be counted.   
Page 19 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
Neurological  deterioration – defined  by [CONTACT_183357] 4 points  or more  on the NIHSS score,  at 
the 24 -hour time  point.  
Evidence  of Infarction – Infarction  of a previously  uninvolved  vascular  territory,  as evaluated  from 
24-hour imaging (Computed Tomography (CT)/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)) by  [CONTACT_183358]. 
 
3.3 Rescue Therapy  
After  the primary  endpoint  angiogram  is taken,  if revascularization  is inadequate  (i.e. less than  
mTICI 2b), rescue therapy is  permitted.  
Use of rescue  therapy,  prior to taking  the primary  endpoint  angiogram,  is a protocol  violation  and 
the resultant  angiogram  outcomes  will be considered failures  to achieve  the primary  endpoint 
irrespective of mTICI score.  
 
Use of any of the following, to treat the patient , is considered  rescue therapy:  
 
• Use of another mechanical thrombectomy  device.  
• Use of mechanical pump aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (e.g. Penumbra Pump) during the  procedure.  
• Initiation of IA-tPA. 
• Use of intra cranial stenting during the  procedure.  
 
Secondary endpoints measured after use of rescue therapy at any time will be censored  from 
the data and where appropriate multiple imputation will be used to ensure sufficient data  (i.e. 
equivalent to that which would be obt ained from a sample size of 176 are available  for 
calculation of the secondary endpoints). Further details are contained in section  8. 
 
 
[ADDRESS_216604] the hypothesis.  Hence,  using 
a single  arm study  makes  efficient  use of the available  cohort  size.   
Page 20 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
Additionally, descriptive statistical reporting of the secondary outcomes will allow  side-by-side 
comparison  of the secondary  endpoints  with  that of comparable  stent -retrievers  from  the SWIFT 
and TREVO II studies.  Hence,  the safety  and efficacy  of the EmboTrap  device  relative  to other 
devices  on the US market  may  be characterized.  
 
4.1 Measurement  scales  
The following  measurement  scales  will be used  in the ARISE  II clinical study:  
mTICI  – modified  thrombolysis  in cerebral  infarction  (TICI)  score.  The primary  study  outcome, 
revascularization,  will be measured  by [CONTACT_183359]  (inclusive  of the 2C rating)  scale.  
TIMI - 'TIMI  Grade  Flow'  is a scoring  system  from  0-3 referring  to levels  of blood  flow  (For 
comparison  of information  the core  laboratory  will also provide  adjudication  on each  image  using  
the TIMI  scales)  
NIHSS Score - The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, or NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool 
used  by [CONTACT_183360] a stroke.  The NIHSS 
is composed  of 11 items,  each  of which  scores  a specific  ability  between  a 0 and 4. For each  item, 
a score  of 0 typi[INVESTIGATOR_183329],  while  a higher  score  is 
indicative  of some  level  of impairment.  The individual  scores  from  each  item  are summed  in order 
to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the  minimum  
score being a  0. 
mRS  – The mo dified  Rankin  Scale  (mRS)  is a commonly  used  scale  for measuring the degree  of 
disability  or dependence  in the daily  activities  of people  who  have  suffered  a stroke  or other  causes  
of neurological  disability.  
 
4.2 Risk / Benefit  analysis  
While  mechanical thrombectomy  may  speed  time  to reperfusion,  like all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_183330]. 
Through  the EmboTrap  device  risk assessment  process, a multi -functional  team  identified  risks 
associated  with  the design,  processing and use of the device,  and identified  the characteristics 
related to its  safety.  
All clinical risks  were  considered,  including those  identified  through  the Risk Management Report, 
and through  the clinical literature  search  process. The risks  listed  below  represent those  identified 
as most  clinically  relevant  through  the literature  review  process. 
• Abrupt vessel  closure.  
• Access  complications.  
• Access site pain, hematoma or hemorrhage.  
• Allergic  reaction  to anticoagulants  or antiplatelet  therapy,  contrast  medium,  or device 
material. 
• Aneurysm or pseudo  aneurysm.

• Vessel trauma, dissection, perforation, rupture or  injury.  
All efforts will be made to minimize the risks in this study by [CONTACT_183361].  
 
 
[ADDRESS_216605]  or their  Legally  Authorized  Representative (as defined  by [CONTACT_183362]),  including an explanation  of the study,  duration,  explanation  of medical  record  access 
and patient anonymity, and how their coded data may be transferred, used for publications or  in 
submissions  for reimbursement  support.  The informed  consent  form  will contain  language  that is 
non-technical  and understandable  to the patient  or his/her  legal  representative.   
Page 22 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
The treatment occurs  in an acute  emergency  situation,  so locally  required  informed  consent 
procedures  may  apply  and will be complied  with.  
Each potential subject will be provided with written and verbal information regarding the  nature  
of the study in an understandable manner. Adequate time will be allowed for the subject  to 
consider  participation  in the clinical trial. Signed,  written  consent  will be obtained from  each 
subject  prior  to data  collection  and entry  into the study.  Any coercion  or undue  influence  of 
potential  subjects  to participate  must  be avoided,  and the subject’s  legal  rights  should not be 
waived. The investigator or an appropriately designated member of the study staff shall co-sign 
the consent form, indicating they believe the subject has understood the nature and risks of  the 
study  and,  in their  estimation,  the subject  clearly  understands  the scope  of the consent.  The 
investigator must inform subjects that they are in a controlled clinical trial, apprise them of their  
rights  as set forth  in the informed  consent  document,  and make  written  documentation  that such 
a discussion took  place.  
If the subject  is not able  to sign the informed  consent,  but has given  his/her  oral consent  to 
participate,  a third  party  can sign the informed  consent  for the subject.  The procedure  will be 
documented in the medical record. If the subject is not able to give his/her informed consent  to 
participate  in the study,  a legally  authorized  relative  or independent  physician  can sign the 
informed  consent  for the subject  if this is approved by [CONTACT_183363]  (IRB)  or 
Ethics Committee (EC).  
Short  form  informed  consent  may  be utilized  if approved  by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  Each  institution  must 
follow  their  institutional  IRB/EC  policy  for obtaining  informed  consent.  If the short  form  informed 
consent  is used,  the summary  must  include  all the basic  elements  of informed  consent  (21 CFR 
50.25; ICH E6 4.8.10).  
The procedure around how the  informed consent is collected will be recorded in each  subjects’  
medical record.  The signed  consent  forms  will be retained  by [CONTACT_183364] 
(for review  only)  to the study  monitor  and auditor  on request.  
Each  site will maintain  a log of all screened  patients  detailing  the reasons  for any subsequent  
patient  exclusions  or non-participation  in the study.  This could  occur  if angiographic  inclusion  and 
exclusion  criteria are not met or if informed  consent  was withdrawn.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_216606]  chooses  to withdraw,  he/she  will be instructed  to contact [CONTACT_183365]. Withdrawal from the investigation will not affect the subject’s follow -up care.  The 
subject will be informed of any significant information regarding new findings that may  develop

CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
during the course  of the research  study  that may  relate  to his or her willingness  to continue 
participation  as a study  subject.  
Subjects  will participate  in their  routine  follow -up and allow  this data  to be gathered  or their  
participation in the study will be prematurely terminated. If their participation is terminated,  any 
of their data which has been already gathered will continue to be included. The completion of a 
subject’s  participation  in the study  or early  departure  from  the study  must  be fully  documented  in 
the subject’s  study  progress  notes.  
Subjects  will be considered discontinued  from  the study  if any of the following  occur:  
• Death or intercurrent illness: If,  during the conduct of the study, a subject dies  or 
experiences an intercurrent illness, all available information should be obtained and  an 
appointed Neuravi representative/ study monitor should be notified no more than  24 
hours from study staff becoming aware of the  event.  
• If a subject’s  death  occurs  while  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  submit  a copy  of the physician’s  death 
summary  report.  If an autopsy  is performed,  submit  a copy  of the autopsy  report,  as well.  
If a subject’s death occurs outside of the study site, obtain all information related to  the 
death  and submit  the investigator’s  summary  of the events  associated  with  the death.  
• Subject  voluntarily  withdraws  from  the study:  A subject  may  withdraw  consent  from  study  
participation at any  time.  
• Subject withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_093]: An investigator may withdraw  an 
enrolled subject from the study for the following  reason:  
Protocol violation: Should a subject be enrolled but later determined  ineligible based on 
previously unavailable source documentation or due to a violation  in following the protocol at the 
study site, this subject will be considered a  protocol violation.  This subject’s  data  will not be 
pooled  for statistical analysis  with  those subjects  confirmed  to be eligible  by [CONTACT_183366].  All protocol  violations  should  be documented  by 
[CONTACT_183367].  
 
5.[ADDRESS_216607]’s general practitioner, the subject will  be 
considered  lost to follow -up. Documentation  is required for all attempts  to locate  the subject.

6 Study  Design  
 
The study aims to include 176 evaluable patients; however, enrolment of up to 228 patients  will 
be allowed  in the event  the data  is needed  to compensate  for “roll in" patients,  missing  or censored  
outcome  data, patient  withdrawal,  or too small a mITT  population  to test the primary  endpoint  for 
the hypothesis as  designed.  
There  are three  FDA cleared  stent  retrievers  indicated  for neuro -thrombectomy:  Merci,  Trevo  and 
Solitaire.  The Trevo  and Solitaire  devices  conducted randomized  trials  using the Merci  device  as a 
control  in support  of premarket  clearance.  The results, of these trials  provide  a valid  scientific  basis 
for the establishment  of a composite  performance  goal derived  using a Bayesian  meta -analysis. At 
176 evaluable patients and 64% successful endpoint achievement the ARISE II study is  expected 
to allow  the EmboTrap  device,  with 90%  power,  to claim  non-inferiority  based  on a one-sided  test 
at the 0.[ADDRESS_216608] -EmboTrap device  use 
angiogram  is a clearly  measurable  efficacy  endpoint  and less susceptible  to influencing factors  
based  on the patient  population  and care  than  other  patient  related  outcomes.  
 
6.1 Site Selection  
The sponsor or a representative of the sponsor will assess each potential site to ensure  the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_183331].  Sites  
will be selected based upon a site assessment considering appropriate facilities, and  the 
qualifications of the investigator(s). Individual investigators will be evaluated by [CONTACT_183368](s), and ability to conduct the study  according 
to the study  protocol.

[IP_ADDRESS] Screening 
Subjects will be screened against the study inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine their initial 
eligibility. A member  of the research  team  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/institution personnel  assigned  to the ARISE  II 
Study)  should review  their  eligibility. All subjects  screened  will be documented  on the 
Screening/Enrolment  log, including the reason  for non-participation  for subjects  who  do not enroll.

of hemorrhage. It is preferred, but not required, that whether CT or MRI is taken at baseline, to 
make  direct  comparison  easier,  the same  imaging  modality  is obtained  at follow -up. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse  Events 
Record  any adverse  events  which  occur  during the procedure. 
The procedure  description  follows.  
6.5.2 Preparation &  Delivery  
• Using standard  interventional  techniques  access  the arterial  system  and using angiography, 
determine the location of the occluded  vessel. 
• Advance  an appropriate  Guide  Catheter , Sheath or Balloon Guide Catheter as close  to the 
occlusion  as possible.  Connect  a rotating hemostasis valve (RHV) to the proximal end of 
this catheter and connect to  a continuous flush  system.  
• Select an appropriate M icrocatheter . Connect an RHV to the proximal end of  the 
Microcatheter  and connect to a continuous flush  system.  
• With  the aid of a suitable  guidewire,  and using standard  catheterization  techniques  and 
fluoroscopic guidan ce, advance the Microcatheter  up to and across the occlusion so  that 
the distal end of the Microcatheter  is positioned distal of the  occlusion.  
• Remove the guidewire from the Microcatheter  and, if desired,  gently infuse contrast media  
through the Microcatheter  to visualize the distal end of the  occlusion.  
• Remove  the Insertion  Tool  with  the preloaded  Device  from  the packaging  hoop,  taking  care 
not to accidentally retract or advance the Device from the Insertion Tool while doing  so. 
• Insert the distal  end of the Insertion Tool through the RHV of the Microcatheter  and wait 
until  fluid  is seen  exiting  the proximal end of the Insertion  Tool,  confirming  that the Device 
is flushed. Advance the Insertion Tool until it contacts the hub of the Microcatheter. Fully 
tighten the RHV to hold the Insertion Tool securely in  position.  
• Confirm that the Insertion Tool is fully seated in the hub of the RHV before proceeding to 
advance  the Device.  Advance  the Device  until  at least  half of the shaft  length  has been 
inserted into the Microcatheter , at which point the Insertion Tool may be  removed.  
6.5.3 Positioning and Deployment  
• Continue  to advance  the Device  until  the distal radiopaque  tip of the Device  aligns  with  the 
distal tip of the  Microcatheter . 
Note : There are  two silver bands positioned on the proximaI portion of the Device shaft to  assist 
in minimizing  the amount  of fluoroscopic  exposure  required  during Device  insertion. If 
using a standard  Microcatheter  (total  length  of 155cm  and a 7cm  RHV), then  when  the first 
silver band on the shaft  approaches  the RHV,  the Device  tip will be approximately  8cm  
from the  distal end of the Microcatheter . When  the second  silver  band on the Device  
shaft approaches  the RHV the Device tip will be nearing  the distal end of the Microcatheter .  
Page 32 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
• Advance the Device in the Microcatheter  and position the EmboTrap within the clot as 
described in the Instructions for Use.  
• While stabilizing the Device shaft, retract the microcatheter to deploy the  Stent- like 
assembly  within  the clot.  The EmboTrap  will be fully  deployed  once  the distal tip of the 
microcatheter has been retracted to a position  over the proximal radiopaque coil of the  
Device.  
• The EmboTrap  should be left to embed  within  the clot for 3-5 minutes  prior  to withdrawal. 
 
6.5.4 Retrieval  
Note : The use of a Mechanical Pump for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_183338].  
• Optimum control of the Device and microcatheter relative positions during retrieval may 
be achieved by [CONTACT_183370] a torque device over the Device shaft and tightening i t against 
the microcatheter  RHV. 
• If using  a Balloon  Guide  Catheter  inflate  the balloon  to occlude  the vessel as per the 
Balloon  Guide  Catheter  IFU. 
• Withdraw  the Device  and Microcatheter  slowly  and carefully  as a unit to the Guide Catheter  
tip while aspi[INVESTIGATOR_183339] a  syringe.  
• As the device reaches the Guide Catheter, apply  vigorous aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (by [CONTACT_129325]), withdraw 
the Device and microcatheter into  the Guide Catheter  and continue to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_183340]. 
Note : If withdrawal  into the Guide Catheter  is difficult  (as may  be the case  with  a large  clot 
burden)  then deflate the balloon (if applicable) and withdraw the guide, Microcatheter and  
Device together through the I ntroducer  Sheath . 
• Disconnect the RHV from the Guide Catheter  and remove the Device, Microcatheter  and 
RHV together  from the  Guide Catheter . 
• Use the syringe  to further aspi[INVESTIGATOR_183341]. 
6.5.5 Cleaning and  Re-use 
• Each  EmboTrap  Revascularization  Device may  be used  for up to three  (3) retrieval attempts.  
• If an additional pass  is to be made  with  the Device then  carefully  remove  any captured 
thrombus from the Device and clean the Device in heparinized saline, rubbing gently  from 
proximal to distal to remove any residual thrombus material. Inspect the Device  carefully 
and if any damage  or deformity  is observed  do not use the Device  – instead  use a new 
EmboTrap Revascularization Device for any subsequent passes. If using the same  Device, 
replace  the Insertion  Tool  onto  the proximal shaft  and retract  the Device into the Insertion 
Tool until it is fully  resheathed.  
Do not attempt more than three (3) retrieval attempts in the same vessel.

CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253  6.5.10 Imaging Core  Laboratory  
The objective of the Imaging Core Lab is to provide an unbiased assessment of the rate  of 
revascularization  defined  by [CONTACT_183371]. The 
Core  Lab will review  all angiograms  obtained.  Data  provided  by [CONTACT_183372] ‘gold 
standard’  and will be used  for data  analysis  and determination  of device  efficacy. Each  angiogram 
will be read independently by [CONTACT_183373].  Any 
discrepancies  in mTICI  scoring  will be resolved  by a third,  independent  reader.  
The Core  Lab will also have  the responsibility  to evaluate  CT/MRI  examinations  to detect and assess 
hemorrhages.  Hemorrhages  will be radiologically  classified  as described  in section  7.1. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_216623] 
are disabled. Two of the primary factors associated with mortality in these patients are  the 
occlusion  location  and the time  to treatment.  Per Smith  et al [12],  large -vessel  occlusions,  present 
in 46%  of unselected  acute  stroke  patients  presenting in academic  medical centers,  are associated 
with  higher  stroke  severity.  These more  proximal  vessels  feed  a large  volume  of brain  tissue, ergo 
clinicians  use the presenting NIHSS  score  as an indicator of large -vessel  occlusion.  
 
6.6.[ADDRESS_216624] revascularization outcome measured angiographically at a centralized  core 
laboratory.  
In both the US and Europe, patients experiencing an acute ischemic stroke receive lytic IV -tPA (if 
they are suitable candidates); if this is not effective then they are treated endovascularly with  a 
stentri ever.  In the US, and in some  European  sites,  the interventionalist  waits  sixty  minutes  to see 
if the lytics  achieve  revascularization  before  using the stent retriever.  Although  there  is a potential 
here  for a difference  in the duration  of exposure  to lytic therapy  before  stentriever  treatment,  it is 
expected  that very  few ARISE  II patients  will be treated  within  an hour  of receiving  lytic therapy.  
While  in both  the United  States  and Europe  lytic therapy  is recommended  for patients  meeting  the 
ECASS inclusion/exclusion criteria between the 3 -4.5 hour TFSO, lytics are not FDA approved  for 
use in this time  window.  Local  practice  follows  the guidances.  
There are no other  population  or location  specific  treatment  differences  present  between  the

CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
patients  treatment in the US and that in Europe  which  could reasonably  be suggested  to influence  
revascularization  results.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_216625]  imaging  data  in line with  routine  practice  as follows:  
• Pre-procedure CT/ MR  imaging  
• Pre-treatment angiogram, post -device placement angiogram (if this was performed)  & 
post -procedure  angiogram  
• 24(-8/+12) hour CT/ MR  imaging  
 
All imaging  should  be in line with  standard  of care.  No extra  imaging  should be performed  for the 
purpose  of the study.  No patient  should  be exposed  to extra  radiation  as a result  of participation.  
Any other  imaging  performed  (for example  as a result  of clinical  deterioration)  will also be 
provided.  
In the event of abrupt  neurologic  deterioration  or when  deemed  necessary  by [CONTACT_093],  an 
emergency  CT or an MR imaging  evaluation  should  be performed.  An immediate  evaluation  of the 
presence/absence of hemorrhage, edema, and/or infarction as contributors to the  clinical  
deterioration will be made. Any imaging taken prior to the routine 24hr imaging (which may  be 
taken  in a time  window  of 16-36 hours  without  becoming a protocol  deviat ion) for this reason  will 
be included in the analysis.  
Cerebral hemorrhage is categorized as hemorrhagic infarct or parenchymal hematoma by  [CONTACT_183374]:  
• Hemorrhagic infarct  is any area  of petechial  or small,  confluent  hemorrhages  within  larger 
regions of hypodense, ischemic injury without mass  effect.  
• A parenchymal  hematoma is a more  homogenous  area of hemorrhage,  with  or without  
intraventricular extension, usually with mass  effect.  
Hemorrhages  will be classified  clinically  and radiologically  according  to the following  categories  [4]: 
Clinical categories:  
• C1: Clinical  deterioration  where  hemorrhage  is the primary  cause<  4 NIHSS points  
• C2: Clinical deterioration  where  hemorrhage  is the primary  cause  ≥ 4 NIHSS points  
  
Page 37 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
Radiological  categories:  
• HI 1: small petechiae  within  the ischemic  field  without  mass  effect  
• HI 2: confluent  petechiae  within  the ischemic  field  without  mass  effect  
• PH 1: Hematoma  within  ischemic  field  with  mild  space  occupying effect but involving  
≤30% of  the infarcted  area 
• PH 2: Hematoma within ischemic field with space occupying effect involving  >30% 
of the infarcted  area  
• RIH: Any intraparenchymal hemorrhage  remote  from  the ischemic  field  
• IVH: Intraventricular hemorrhage  
• SAH: Subarachnoid  hemorrhage  
• SDH:   Sub Dural Hematoma  
• EDH: Extra Dural Hematoma

and at 7 days  (or discharge  whichever  is sooner)  time  points  post -procedure.  An additional NIHSS 
score should be obtained when any signs of neurologic deterioration occur or in the event of an 
ICH to assess the degree of deterioration.  A certified  examiner  should perform  all neurologic  
evaluations. The 90-day evaluation  will record  the mRS  score.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_216627]  a performance  goal  for 
efficacy  (PG efficacy ). In order  to claim  non-inferiority  against  an efficacy  driven  performance  goal,  the 
lower bound of a (95%) confidence interval must be shown to be greater than a  non-inferiority 
limit  (NL) which  is the predetermined  PG efficacy . 
The PG efficacy  has been  derived  from  a meta -analysis  of revascularization  efficacy  rates  from 
approved  predicate  devices’  adjudicated  performances  as reported  in the literature.  
The Performance  Goal  (PG)  is calculated  using a Bayesian  Hierarchical  Random  Effects  Meta - 
Analysis  which  incorporates  a down -weighting of the Merci  data  by [CONTACT_183375].  
The test for non -inferiority for performance will be based on a one -sided test (at the 0.025 
significance  level) for a binomial proportion  with  hypotheses:  
H0: PG efficacy ≤ N L   versus  H 1: PG efficacy > N L 
 
An equivalent  testing  procedure  is available  by [CONTACT_183376]  a confidence  
interval for the population  proportion.  Demonstrating  non-inferiority  for efficacy  necessitates 
rejecting  the null hypothesis  in favor of the alternative  hypothesis,  in this case  based  on the upper   
Page 38 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
limit  of a 95%  confidence  interval  for a population  proportion.  
Estimates of each population parameter of interest for all other endpoints will be provided  using 
appropriate  confidence  intervals.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_216628]  90%  power  to 
demonstrate  non-inferiority  against  a non-inferiority  limit  (NL) with  an efficacy  level  of 0.56,  based 
on a one-sided  exact  test for a binomial proportion  [5] [6] at the 0.[ADDRESS_216629]  across  five European  
centers.  The TICI 2b or greater  rating  achieved  was reported  by [CONTACT_183377]  74%.  It is 
expected  that adjudication  may  reduce  this somewhat  as was the case  in both  the Trevo  II and 
SWIFT  studies.  Using 68%  will ensure  the statistical comparison  is valid  in the event the adjudicated 
success rate of the EmboTrap  device  is lower  than  that self- reported  by 6%. 
The evaluable  sample  of [ADDRESS_216630] 
and the revascularization  results  are independent  of each  other.  
8.2.1     Missing and Censored Dat a 
An extra  30% to the required  evaluable  patient  cohort  number  of 176  is included to allow for roll in 
patients (up to 36 roll ins in US sites, and up to 12 in the EU) and missing data,  bringing  the total  
cohort to  228. Missing data  will be examined,  and the reasons  will be investigated  and reported.  
Multiple imputation  methods  will be used,  where  needed,  to address  any missing  endpoint  data  in 
both  the ITT and mITT  analysis. 
Secondary endpoint data will be censored where rescue therapy was used. Where  less than  176 
evaluable data points are available, data will be imputed using chained equations with  20 
imputations per observation  [7]. 
The final analysis of the multiple imputed data will involve two steps: 1) running the analysis  on 
each  of the imputed  datasets,  and 2) aggregating  the estimates  from  each  dataset  to obtain  the 
final result using Rubin's rules [8] to combine the estimates while adjusting for the  variance 
between imputations and across imputed datasets  [9]. 
 
8.3 Analysis Methods  
8.3.1 Primary  Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be examined using the hypothesis described in section 8.1 above,  for 
both  the ITT population  and for the mITT  described  below.  
8.3.2 Intention to  Treat  
All subjects confirmed to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria via angiography in the ARISE  II 
Study  will be included in the ITT analysis  of safety  and effectiveness,  as data  allows.   
Page 39 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Modified Intention To  Treat  
In order  to analyze  a comparable  population  to that used  in the predicate  studies, SWIFT  and 
TREVO  II, the primary  hypothesis  will also be tested  on a “Modified  Intention  to Treat”  (mITT) 
subgroup.  The mITT  subgroup  will reflect  the lytic regime  used  in the TREVO II and SWIFT  studies.  
• This subgroup  will exclude  screen  failures  for inclusion  criterion  11. 
• This subgroup will have been treated in compliance with the protocol and will meet  the 
lytic regime  requirements  set out in inclusion  criteria 7 and 8. 
• And only  patients  who  are contra -indicated  for IV-tPA or in whom  IV-tPA has failed  will be 
included in the mITT analysis. Failure of IV -tPA is defined as angiographic evidence  of 
persistent  target  vessel  occlusion,  one hour  or more  after the initiation  of IV-tPA therapy.  
The cut off time  point  for initiation  of lytic therapy  will be in line with  the FDA approved time 
indicated which is within 3 hours of stroke onset. All patients who meet the study entry  criteria, 
are enrolled  in the trial and were  treated  per the protocol  (introduction  of rescue  therapy  prior to 
three retrieval attempts  with  EmboTrap  is a protocol  violation)  will be included in the mITT  analysis 
sample.  It is expected  this will include  most  of the ARISE  II population  and the facility  to enroll up 
to [ADDRESS_216631] 
deviation.  All categorical variables  will be reported  as counts  and percentages.  
Box and bean  plots  will be generated  for each  continuous  response  variables  while  bar charts  will 
be generated  for each  categorical variable.  
At study completion summaries of each clinical outcome variable will include corresponding  95% 
confidence  intervals  in order  to provide  an estimate of the corresponding population  means, 
medians and  proportions.  
The following  primary  efficacy  endpoint  will be examined  using the model  discussed:  
• Revascularization measured using modified Thrombolysis in Cerebrovascular Infarction 
(mTICI inclusive  of the 2c rating). Successful  achievement  of the endpoint  is defined  as 
achieving a mTICI score of 2b or greater in the target vessel, following 3 or less passes  of 
the EmboTrap  device.   
Page 40 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
The primary  safety  endpoint  will be evaluated  descriptively:  
• The primary  safety  endpoint  will be the rate of sICH  together  with  SADEs  (excluding those 
already counted in  sICH).  
The secondary  endpoints  will be examined  descriptively  to further  advance  the safety  and efficacy 
profile  of the device.  Full definitions  are provided  in section  3.2 of this protocol:  
Demographics, baseline characteristics, procedural information, and clinical outcomes  (efficacy  
and safety)  will also be summarized.  
The study will also perform subgroup analyses of descriptive statistics for the cohort based  on 
• Specific vascular location of the occlusion (i.e. proximal M1/ distal M1 /M2,  etc.)  
• Technique of treatment as described  below  
Use of a balloon guide vs. no balloon  guide  
Use of an intermediate catheter vs. no intermediate  catheter  
A summary  of the proportions  of subjects  receiving  each  category  score  on the mTICI  scale  will be 
reported.  
Note  that adverse  events  will be adjudicated  as to the relationship  to the EmboTrap  device, 
procedure  or the disease  state  as well to the severity  of the event.  Subgroup  analyses  of the points  
described  in the synopsis  will be completed.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_216632] for homogeneity.  
 
8.3.5 Deviations from the statistical  plan  
Any departure or deviation from these planned statistical methodologies will be  documented and  
discussed in the Statistical Analysis  Plan  that will include  the statistical  rationale  for change.  
 
 
9 Amendment  to the  CIP 
 
Only Neuravi is allowed to modify this protocol. The change will be in the form of a  protocol 
amendment.  Any modification  that potentially  affects  subjects’  rights  or safety  must  also be 
approved  by [CONTACT_183378].  In an emergency  situation,  where  action 
is necessary  to protect  the life or physical  wellbeing  of the subject,  a departure  from  the protocol 
for an individual subject may be allowed, and that departure will be for that subject only. In  such 
circumstances,  the investigator  must  notify  the EC or IRB and Neuravi  and must  describe  the 
conditions  necessitating  the departure  from  the protocol  and the outcome  of the emergency 
intervention in a written report. Neuravi will determine whether the subject is to conti nue in  the 
study  or be considered a protocol  violation.

All protocol  violations  and deviations  from  the study  protocol  must  be reported  to the appointed 
Neuravi representative/ study monitor on a protocol violation/deviation form, regardless  of 
whether  medically  justifiable,  pre-approved  by [CONTACT_183379]. In addition, the investigator is required to adhere to the ethics  committee/IRB  
procedures  for reporting protocol  violations  and deviations. 
Investigators  must  obtain  prior  approval from  Neuravi before  initiating  deviations  from  the 
investigational protocol, except in situations where necessary to protect the life or physical  well- 
being of a subject  in an emergency  situation,  or situations  beyond the investigator’s  control  (such 
as subjects not attending scheduled follow -up visits, e tc.). Approval for deviations shall be 
documented  in writing  and maintained  in the investigator  and clinical study  management  files. All 
deviations  will be reported  to Neuravi,  regardless  of medical justification,  pre-approval  by [CONTACT_183380],  
or emergency  nature.  Subject -specific  protocol  deviations  will be reported  using the protocol 
deviation form eCRF. Non -subject -specific protocol deviations (e.g. unauthorized use of  the 
investigational device in the US outside the study, unauthorized use of the investi gational device 
in the US by a physician who has not signed the investigator agreement, etc.) shall be notified  in 
writing  to Neuravi   FDA regulations  (21 CFR 812.140 (a) (4)) require  investigators  to maintain  
accurate,  complete and current  records, including documentation  showing the dates  of and 
reasons  for each  deviation  from  the protocol.  Per 21 CFR 812.46 (a), failure  to comply  with  the 
investigational plan  may  result  in termination  of the investigator’s  participation  in the study.

11 Device Accountability  
 
11.1 Europe  
As the study  device  for this clinical investigation  is legally  marketed  and approved  for use in all 
participating centers the regulatory requirements for device accountability and traceability  are 
those  outlined  in ISO13485:2012.  Device  traceability  will be maintained  by [CONTACT_183381]13485:2012  accredited  quality  system. 
 
11.2 United  States  
Neuravi is responsible for the traceability of the study device (EmboTrap) for this  clinical 
investigation.  Neuravi  assumes responsibility  for maintaining  the following  records:  
• Quantity of the devices, the dates the devices are delivered to the study  suite.  
• Lot numbers of all devices to be used for the  study.  
• Records  of the shipment  of the study  devices  and ancillary  supplies  to the investigational  
site.  
 
Neuravi  will ship devices  only  to qualified sites  participating  in the investigation  who  have  the 
appropriate traceability and stock management controls in place. The appointed  Neuravi 
representative/ study monitor will ensure the study site meets the record -keepi[INVESTIGATOR_183342]. The investigator is responsible  for proper  storage  of received  devices  and ancillary  
supplies at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and for maintaining a current device -tracking log for the duration of  the 
study. The study monitor will review device storage conditions and the completion of the  site’s 
device  tracking  log. Reconciliation of device  disposition  will be documented.  The names  of all 
persons  who  received,  used,  or disposed  of any device  at the site will be recorded.  
Records for the return of all study devices and ancillary supplies to Neuravi will be  completed  by 
[CONTACT_3452], verified by [CONTACT_183382] (study monitor), and  final 
disposition  records  will be maintained  by [CONTACT_183380].  
 
 
12 Safety and adverse  events  
 
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence  in a subject that may, or may  not, 
have a causal relationship with the study treatment.  
 
An Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is any untoward and unintended response to a medical  device. 
This includes  Serious  Adverse  Device  Effects  and any event  resulting  from  insufficiencies  or 
inadequacies in the instructions for use or the deployment of the device, and any event  resulting 
from a user error.   
Page 43 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
A Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  is an adverse  event  which  
 
a) Led to  death,  
 
b) Led to serious  deterioration  in the health  of the subject,  that either  resulted  in 
 
1) A life -threatening illness or injury,  or 
2) A permanent  impairment  of a body  structure  or a body  function,  or 
3) In-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or 
4) Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury  or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body  function,  
 
NOTE:  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113617] a pre-existing  condition,  or a procedure  required  by [CONTACT_10396], 
without  serious  deterioration  in health,  is not considered a serious  adverse  event.  
A Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) is one where the EmboTrap device caused, or cannot be 
ruled  out as having caused,  an effect  that has resulted  in any of the consequences  characteristic  of 
a serious  adverse  event  (e.g.  Vessel dissections  or perforations  caused  by [CONTACT_183383]).  
Procedure Related Serious Adverse Events (PRSAE) is where the interventional  procedure 
caused,  or can not be ruled  out as having caused,  an effect  that has resulted  in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse  event.  
Unanticipated Adverse  Device  Effect  (UADE)  means  any serious  adverse  effect  on health  or safety 
or any life-threatening problem  or death  caused  by, or associated  with,  a device,  if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in  the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any  other 
unanticipated  serious  problem  associated  with  a device  that relates  to the rights,  safety,  or welfare 
of subjects. 
The sponsor  will r eport  the results  of an evaluation  of any UADE  to FDA and all reviewing  IRB/ethics 
committees  and investigators  within  [ADDRESS_216635]  experienced  clinical  sequelae:  
• Vessel perforation  
• Intramural arterial dissection  
• Asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage  
• Embolization in a previously uninvolved territory

CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
The Electronic  Data  Capture  program  “www.e -capture.net” will record  all subject  information 
including any specific  incident  details  for all participants  in the trial. This includes  all AE, ADE,  SAE, 
SADE and UADE events. The program will also capture all subsequent interventions  and/or 
treatments administered to the subject. The information is entered directly into the database  by 
[CONTACT_183384]. The screen -shot below provides an illustration of the type of 
information  recorded  by [CONTACT_78311].  
 
 
 
12.1 Clinical Events Committee  (CEC)  
An independent board consisting of stroke neurologists and neurointerventionalists who are not 
participating  in the study  will adjudicate  serious  adverse  events  in the trial.  
The role of the CEC will be to: 
 
• Adjudicate all hemorrhages documented by [CONTACT_183385].  
• Adjudicate  all dissections/perforations  documented  by [CONTACT_183386]/or  IA therapy  used.  
• Adjudicate  whether  an SAE is deemed  attributable  to the procedure,  to the EmboTrap 
Device,  Adjuvant  therapy  (IA thrombolysis,  thrombectomy),  or from  the natural  course  of 
the initial stroke.  
• Continuous  evaluation  of available  external  data  and/or  knowledge,  as presented  at major 
congresses  and /or published  in peer -reviewed  journals,  which  may  have  an impact  on the 
adjudication  and analysis  of the reported  events.

CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253  12.[ADDRESS_216636]  (DSMB)  
An independent  board  consisting of stroke  neurologists,  neurointerventionalist(s)  and a statistician 
who  are not participating  in the study  will monitor  the adverse  events  and the occurrence  rate in 
the trial. 
 
The role of the DSMB  will be to: 
 
• Monitor  the SAE rate and establish  specific  “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]”  for the trial.  
• Make recommendations for revisions to the protocol to the EmboTrap device regarding 
safety of the study.  
• Periodically  review  and monitor  aggregated and individual  subject  data  related  to safety, 
data  integrity,  scientific  validity  and overall conduct  of the study,  to ensure  the rights, 
safety, and welfare of the study  participants;  
• Monitor subject accrual and  retention;  
• Consider  factors  external  to the study  when  relevant  information  becomes  available,  such 
as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of  the 
participants or on the ethical conduct of the  study;  
• Ensure  the confidentiality  of the trial data  and the results  of monitoring;  
 
12.3 Event  notification  
12.3.1 Adverse Events (AE) and Adverse Device Effects  (ADE)  
All adverse  events  and adverse  device  effects  shall be recorded  on sponsor -provided  adverse  event 
electronic  case  report  forms  eCRF.  The safety  assessments will consist of Adverse  Events  (AE) from 
the time  the ICF is signed  through  Day 90 for those  patients  enrolled,  and to discharge  or 72 hours 
for those  patients  identified  as screening failures  though  angiographic  criteria.  Adverse  events  and 
adverse  device  effects  shall  be recorded  in the form  of a diagnosis,  rather  than  providing  the 
various  signs  and symptoms  for a particular health  condition.  The investigator  or investigator- 
appointed  study  personnel  will complete  these eCRFs.  Adverse  event  eCRFs  should  be provided  to 
an appointed Neuravi representative (study monitor) for review within [ADDRESS_216637]. If the Investigator is made 
aware of any  SAEs after Day 90, these should also be reported  to Neuravi  or its designee  
provided  the SAE is considered  related  to the investigational device.  The site would  then  provide  
a completed  SAE form  within  1 business  day and the event will be followed  until  resolution,  or 
until  adequate stabilization is  met.  
An AE that o ccurs  after the ICF has been  signed  and before  the treatment with  the EmboTrap  has 
started  is identified  as a pretreatment AE (PTAE).  This will include  AEs occurring  in those  patients 
identified  as screening failures  through  the angiographic  inclusion  or exclusion  criteria.  An AE that 
occurs after treatment using EmboTrap has started will be considered a treatment emergent  AE 
(TEAE).  All AEs must  be recorded  and reported  accordingly,  whether  they  appear  causally  related 
to the interventional  procedure,  or not. Adverse  events  will be followed  until  the outcome  is 
known  or until  the Investigator  feels  no further medical  follow -up is warranted.   
Page 46 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
All AEs will be reported  verbatim  as provided  by [CONTACT_093].  The AEs will be categorized  using 
MedDRA Coding of Adverse Events nomenclature Standardized nomenclature that will be 
ascertained  includes  lowest  level  and preferred  MedDRA  terms,  MedDRA  System  Organ  Class. The 
Adverse  Events  will be monitored  and trended  by [CONTACT_183387] a periodic  basis. Adverse Events are subject 
to adjudication as detailed in section 12.1 . 
12.3.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Serious Adverse Device Effects (SADE)  
The investigator must notify the appointed Neuravi representative/ study monitor of all  serious 
adverse  events  and serious  adverse  device  effects  immediately  after  becoming  aware  of the event 
(no later than 24 hours from being notified of the event). The investigator may also contact  [CONTACT_183388]/  study  monitor  for assistance in determining whether  or not the 
event  in question is considered serious. Notification  should be provided  by [CONTACT_183389] e -mail to the  appointed 
Neuravi representative.  
Any Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE) or Serious  Adverse  Device Effect  (SADE) must  be reported  “in 
writing” to Neuravi within 5 days  of knowledge . Copi[INVESTIGATOR_183343]/  study  monitor.  
Should potential SAEs or SADEs be discovered during the study of which the investigator was  not 
aware, Neuravi or the appointed Neuravi Ltd representative/ study monitor will provide  relevant 
documentation  within  10 days  from  becoming aware  of the event for the investigator’s  review  and 
submission to the ethics  committee,  if applicable.  
12.3.3 Device failure, malfunction, misuse and near  incidents  
All device  failures,  malfunctions,  misuse and near  incidents  (as defined  below)  will be documented 
on the electronic  case  report  form  and reported  to Neuravi  within  1 working  day after the 
investigator becomes  aware  of the event,  and reported  to the IRB as required.  
• Device  failure: A  device  has failed  if it is used  according  to the labeling,  including without 
limitation,  instructions  for use, and applicable  standards  of medical practice  but does  not 
perform  according  to the labeling  and negatively  impacts  the treatment.  
• Device  malfunction: A device  malfunction  is a change  in the function of the device  that is 
not described  in the labeling  and that may  or may  not affect  device  performance.  
• Device  misuse:  A misused  device,  i.e. one that is not used  by [CONTACT_183390], including without limitation,  those 
described  in the instructions  for use and labeling,  will not be considered a malfunction.

22 Publications  Plan  
 
All information concerning the EmboTrap device or Neuravi (e.g. patent  applications, 
manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, and materials information) supplied to  the 
investigator by [CONTACT_183395].  The investigator  agrees  to use this information  only  in accomplishing  
the study  and will not use it or the data  generated  from  the study  for other  purposes  without  first 
obtaining the written  consent  of Neuravi.  
It is understood that Neuravi will use the information developed in this clinical study as part of  a 
development program for the EmboTrap device, and therefore may disclose this information  as 
required to other Neuravi clinical investigators or to government regulatory agencies.  The 
investigator understands  that she or he has the obligation  to provide  complete  test results  and all 
data  developed  during this study  to Neuravi  or its designate.  
Every effort will be made to publish the results of this study irrespective of whether the  findings 
are in favor of the EmboTrap devic e. To this end, and to avoid publication bias, the ARISE II  study  
will be registered,  prior  to enrolment  commencing,  on the clinicaltrials.gov  database. 
A Publications  Committee  will be formed  to review  and publish  the data  from  the study.  This 
committee will include  the principal investigator,  co-principal  investigator,  and one representative 
of the sponsor.  The committee will create  a publication  policy  describing in detail the organization 
of authorship.  The Publications  Committee  will write/review  all drafts  of abstracts  and full-length 
manuscripts,  and will choose  the appropriate  journal  (for manuscripts)  or meeting  (for abstracts) 
for submission.  All members  of the Executive  Steering  Committee  will be named  on the study  
report  publication  in order  of volume  of enrollment.  For clarity,  the Principal Investigators  will have  
the final decision  making  and editorial  rights  on the paper  submitted  for publication.

Appendix A - DECLARATION  OF HELSINKI  
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964  and amended  by  [CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_216647] WMA General Assembly, Washington,  DC, [LOCATION_003], October 2002 (Note 
of Clarification on paragraph 29 added) 55th  WMA  General  Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 
2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30  added)  59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Korea, 
October  2008 
 
A. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World  Medical Association  (WMA)  has developed  the Declaration  of Helsinki as a statement 
of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects , including research  on 
identifiable  human  material and data.  The Declaration  is intended  to be read  as a whole  and each 
of its constituent paragraphs  should not be applied  without  consideration  of all other  relevant 
paragraphs.  
2. Although  the Declaration  is addressed  primarily  to physicians,  the WMA  encourages  other 
participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these  principles. 
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including those 
who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are  dedicated 
to the fulfilment of this  duty.  
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with  the words, "The health of  my 
patient  will be my first consideration,"  and the International  Code  of Medical Ethics  declares  that, 
"A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care."  
5. Medical  progress  is based  on research  that ultimately  must  include  studies  involving  human 
subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be  provided 
appropriate access to participation in  research.  
 
6. In medical  research  involving  human  subjects, the well-being of the individual  research  subject 
must take precedence over all other  interests.  
7. The primary  purpose  of medical research  involving human  subjects  is to understand  the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and  therapeutic 
interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions  must 
be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency,  accessibility 
and quality.  
 
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and  burdens.

CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
9. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human  subjects 
and protect their  health  and rights.  Some  research  populations  are particularly  vulnerable  and 
need special protection. These include those who cannot give or refuse consent for  themselves 
and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue  influence.  
10. Physicians  should consider  the ethical,  legal and regulatory  norms  and standards  for research 
involving  human  subjects  in their  own  countries  as well as applicable  international norms  and 
standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or 
eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
 
B. PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
11. It is the duty  of physicians  who  participate  in medical research  to protect  the life, health, 
dignity,  integrity,  right  to self-determination,  privacy,  and confidentiality  of personal  information 
of research  subjects. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific  
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant  sources 
of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation.  The 
welfare of animals used for research must be  respected.  
13. Appropriate  caution  must  be exercised  in the conduct  of medical research  that may  harm  the 
environment.  
14. The design  and performance  of each  research  study  involving  human  subjects  must  be clearly 
described in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the  ethical  
considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have  been 
addressed.  The protocol  should  include  information  regarding  funding,  sponsors, institutional 
affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest and incentives for subjects and provisions  for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in  the 
research study. The protocol should describe arrangements for post -study access by  [CONTACT_183396].  
15. The research  protocol  must  be submitted  for considerat ion, comment,  guidance  and approval 
to a research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be independent of 
the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take into consideration  the 
laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as  well 
as applicable  international  norms  and standards  but these must  not be allowed  to reduce  or 
eliminate  any of the protections  for research  subjects  set forth  in this Declaration. The committee 
must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide  monitoring 
information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse events.  The 
committee may make no change to the protocol without consideration and  approval.

CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_183397].  Research  on patients  or healthy  volunteers  
requires  the supervision  of a competent and appropriately  qualified physician  or other  health  care  
professional. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with  the 
physician  or other  health  care  professional  and never  the research  subjects, even  though  they 
have giv en consent.  
17. Medical  research  involving  a disadvantaged  or vulnerable  population  or community  is only 
justified if the research is responsive to the health needs and priorities of this population  or 
community  and if there  is a reasonable  likelihood  that this population  or community  stands  to 
benefit from the results of the research.  
18. Every medical research study involving human subjects must be preceded by  [CONTACT_183398].  
19. Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database before recruitment  of 
the first  subject.  
20. Physicians may not participate in a research study involving human subjects unless they  are 
confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be  satisfactorily 
managed.  Physicians  must  immediately  stop  a study  when  the risks  are found to outweigh  the 
potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of positive and beneficial  results. 
21. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of  the 
objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the research subjects.  
22. Participation  by [CONTACT_183399]. 
Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no  competent 
individual may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely  agrees.  
23. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and  the 
confidentiality  of their  personal  information  and to minimize  the impact  of the study  on their  
physical, mental and social integrity.  
24. In medical  research  involving  competent  human  subjects, each  potential  subject  must  be 
adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, 
institutional  affiliations  of the researcher,  the anticipated  benefits  and potential  risks  of the study 
and the discomfort  it may  entail,  and any other  relevant  aspects  of the study.  The potential 
subject  must  be informed  of the right  to refuse  to participate  in the study  or to withdraw  consent 
to participate  at any time  without  reprisal.  Special attention  should be given  to the specific 
information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver  the 
information. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information,  the  
Page 57 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
physician  or another  appropriately  qualified individual must  then  seek  the potential subject's 
freely -given  informed  consent,  preferably  in writing.  If the consent  cannot  be expressed  in writing,  
the non -written consent must be formally documented and  witnessed.  
25. For medical research  using identifiable  human  material  or data,  physicians  must  normally  seek 
consent  for the collection,  analysis,  storage  and/or  reuse.  There may  be situations  where  consent 
would  be impossible  or impractical to obtain  for such  research  or would  pose  a threat  to the 
validity  of the research.  In such  situations  the research  may  be done  only  after  consideration  and 
approval of a research ethics  committee.  
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should  be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician  or 
may  consent  under  duress.  In such  situations  the informed  consent  should  be sought  by [CONTACT_183400].  
27. For a potential  research  subject  who  is incompetent,  the physician  must  seek  informed 
consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in  a 
research  study  that has no likelihood  of benefit  for them  unless  it is intended  to promote  the 
health  of the population  represented  by [CONTACT_112988],  the research  cannot  instead  be 
performed with competent persons, and the research entails only minimal risk and  minimal  
burden.  
28. When  a potential  research  subject  who  is deemed  incompetent is able  to give assent  to 
decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to  the 
consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject's dissent should  be 
respected.  
29. Research  involving  subjects  who  are physically  or mentally  incapable  of giving  consent,  for 
example,  unconscious  patients,  may  be done  only  if the physical  or mental  condition  that prevents 
giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. In  such 
circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally  authorized 
representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed,  the 
study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for  involving 
subjects  with  a condition  that renders  them  unable  to give informed  consent  have  been  stated  in 
the research  protocol  and the study  has been  approved  by a research  ethics  committee.  Consent 
to remain  in the research  should be obtained as soon  as possible  from  the subject  or a legally 
authorized  representative.  
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication  of 
the results  of research.  Authors  have  a duty  to make  publicly  available  the results  of their  research 
on human  subjects  and are accountable  for the completeness  and accuracy  of their  reports.  They 
should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as 
positive  results  should  be published  or otherwise made  publicly  available.  Sources  of funding, 
institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports  of  
Page 58 of 64  
 
CIP002 Rev 05 Confidential and Proprietary  IDE #: G140253   
 
research not in accordance with  the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted  for 
publication.  
 
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED  WITH  
MEDICAL  CARE  
31. The physician  may  combine  medical  research  with  medical care  only  to the extent that the 
research  is justified  by [CONTACT_183401],  diagnostic  or therapeutic  value  and if the physician 
has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect  the 
health of the patients who serve as research  subjects. 
32. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested  against 
those of the best current proven intervention, except in the following  circumstances:  
• The use of placebo,  or no treatment,  is acceptable  in studies  where  no current  proven 
intervention exists;  or 
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo 
is necessary  to determine  the efficacy  or safety  of an intervention  and the patients  who 
receive placebo  or no treatment will not be subject  to any risk of serious  or irreversible  
harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this  option.  
33. At the conclusion of the study,  patients  entered  into the study  are entitled  to be informed 
about  the outcome  of the study  and to share  any benefits  that result  from  it, for example,  access 
to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
34. The physician  must  fully  inform  the patient  which  aspects  of the care  are related  to the 
research. The refusal of a patient  to participate in a study or the patient's decision to  withdraw  
from the study must never interfere with the patient- physician  relationship.  
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have  been 
ineffective,  the physician,  after seeking  expert  advice,  with  informed  consent  from  the patient  or 
a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the  physician's 
judgment  it offers  hope  of saving  life, re-establishing  health  or alleviating  suffering. Where  
possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its  safety 
and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate,  made 
publicly available.

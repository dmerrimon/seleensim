July 25, 2008  2 Objectives:  
 
The overall objective of this study is to determine if Nebivolol a) attenuates angiotensin II -
induced increase in oxidative stress, ther eby [CONTACT_708598] -induced 
vasoconstriction and blood pressure elevation and b) attenuates sympathetic mediated 
vasoconstriction during exercise, thereby [CONTACT_708599].  
 Schema 
In 25 untr eated hypertensive subjects, we will measure sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) with 
direct intraneural recording of sympathetic action potential (microneurography), skeletal 
muscle oxygenation (Near Infrared spectroscopy), plasma F2 -isoprostanes, BP, forearm blood 
flow (high-resolution ultrasonography), forearm vascular resistance (FVR, the ratio of mean arterial pressure to forearm blood flow), cardiac output (noninvasive impedance 
plethysmography), total peripheral resistance (TPR, the ratio of mean arteri al pressure to 
cardiac output) in untreated stage I hypertensive subjects at baseline, during handgrip exercise, and during infusion of intravenous Ang II. Then, we will randomize our subjects to 
receive either 3 months of Nebivolol or Metoprolol, using a crossover design. There will be a 2-
week washout period between the two treatments. We will assess SNA and skeletal muscle oxygenation during handgrip exercise and compare the dose response curve of Ang II -induced 
increase in plasma F2-isoprostanes, FVR, TPR, and BP at baseline, after 3 months of Nebivolol, and after 3 months of Metoprolol treatment in the same subjects.

July 25, 2008  4 Background  
 
In normal physiologic states, muscle contraction during exercise blunts alpha -adrenergic mediated 
vasoconstr iction in order to maintain blood flow to the exercising muscles, a concept known as 
“functional sympatholysis” 1,2. Studies in animals 3,4 and normal volunteers 5 by [CONTACT_6283]. Thomas and Victor 
from our institution indicated a major role of nitric oxide (NO) derived from neuronal nitric oxide 
synthase (nNOS) in the skeletal muscle in the prevention of sympathetic vasoc onstriction.  Recent 
study in hypertensive rats indicates presence of impaired functional sympatholysis related to 
Angiotensin II -induced increase in oxidative stress, which inactivates NO 6. This adverse effe ct of Ang II 
can be reversed by [CONTACT_708600], tempol 6. Studies in hypertensive patients in our laboratory 
also recently confirm presence of impaired functional sympatholysis during rhythmic handgrip e xercise, 
resulting in augmented skeletal muscle hypoxia, as evidenced by [CONTACT_708601] (NIR) Spectroscopy. Whether Nebivolol restores increase in forearm blood flow during exercise and improves skeletal 
muscle oxygenation by [CONTACT_708602] -induced super oxide formation remains unknown.  
 
Angiotensin II has also been shown to promote peripheral vasoconstriction and elevated blood 
pressure (BP) in both hypertensive and normotensive subjects by [CONTACT_708603] 
7,8. This effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) was reversed by [CONTACT_708604] C in hea lthy volunteers 8. Previous study als o demonstrated that Ang II -induced BP 
elevation was attenuated by [CONTACT_708605], but not by [CONTACT_708606] 
9. Mechanisms underlying this observation is unknown but could be mediated 
by [CONTACT_708607]. Nebivolol has been shown to inhibit Ang II -induced superoxide 
formation by  [CONTACT_708608] -oxidase in rats 10 and decrease markers of oxidative stress in 
hypertensive patients 11. However, efficacy of Nebivolol in attenuating increase in oxidative stress, 
vasoconstriction, and hypertension during Ang II infusion has not been previously assessed in 
hypertensive patients.  
 
Agent/Device 
 
1. Nebivolol  
Trade Name: [CONTACT_74994][CONTACT_708609]: Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc  
Pharmacology: Nebivolol is a beta1 selective adrenergic receptor blocker approved by [CONTACT_708610] (2.5 -40 mg/day). Nebovolol lacks intrinsic symp athomimetic activity at clinical 
relevant doses with no alpha -1 adrenergic blocking activity. Mechanisms of antihypertensive effects of 
beta blockers in general include 1) peripheral inhibition of beta 1 receptors leading to decreased 
cardiac output, 2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery, and 3) 
suppression of renin activity.  Nebivolol may also reduce BP by [CONTACT_708611] -dependent 
release of nitric oxide in hypertensive patients, which was not observed with ot her beta blockers 12.  
 
Toxicity: In placebo -controlled clinical trials comparing nebivolol with placebo, discontin uation of 
therapy due to adverse events was reported in 2.8% of patients treated with nebivolol and 2.2% of 
patients given placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation of nebivolol were headache (0.4%), nausea (0.2%) and bradycardia (0.2%). Other adverse events associated with higher 
dose than recommended by [CONTACT_708612] . 
 
2. Metoprolol Succinate  
Trade name: [CONTACT_708630]: Astr a Zeneca 
5 
July 25, 2008  5 Pharmacology: Toprol XL is a beta1 selective adrenergic receptor blocker approved by [CONTACT_708610] (25 -400 mg/day).  Mechanisms of antihypertensive effects of beta blockers in 
general include 1) peripheral inhibition of bet a 1 receptors leading to decreased cardiac output, 2) a 
central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery, and 3) suppression of renin activity.   
 
Toxicity: Tiredness and dizziness have occurred in about [ADDRESS_963223] occurred in approximately 3 of 1 00 patients. Cold extremities; arterial insufficiency, 
usually of the Raynaud type; palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]; congestive heart failure; peripheral edema; syncope; chest 
pain; and hypotension have been reported in about 1 of 100 patients. Wheezing (bronchospasm) and 
dyspnea have been reported in about [ADDRESS_963224] also been reported. 
 
3. Angiotensin II  
Tradename: N/A  
Source: [COMPANY_006] Biosciences, Switzerland  
Pharmacology: Angiotensin II causes direct vasoconstriction via angiotensin receptor subtype I, 
resulting in elevated BP. Angiotensin II also stimulates release of aldosterone from adrenal gland, 
resulting in increased sodium absorption and potassium secretion from the renal tubules. Angiote nsin II 
will be administered intravenously at the dose of 1, 2, and 3 ng/kg/min for [ADDRESS_963225] vascular sensitivity in hypertensive patients.  
 
IND # 53,558  
Toxicity: Potential side effects are hypertension and hypokalemia. However, th e dose of 3 ng/kg/min of 
Angiotensin II has been administered to more than 400 untreated essential hypertensive patients and was shown to increase mean arterial pressure by 3 -20 mmHg 
13-15. None of these subjects experienced 
any complication from the drug. A higher dose of Angiotensin II of 5 ng/kg/min has been administered 
to patients with  hypertension from aldosterone producing adenoma on 3 separate days without 
complications 16. The increase in mean arterial pressure in that study was between 10 -20 mmHg 16.

July 25, 2008  6 Eligibility Criteria 
 
 Experiments will be performed in stage I (140- 159/90- 99 mmHg) untreated hypertensive subjects, age 
18-65, without target organ disease.

  (9) Concomitant drug treatment which raise endogenous nitric oxide levels such as nitrates or 
phosphodiesterase V inhibitors (Viagra, Levitra)  
  (10) History of symptomatic bradycardia or heart block  
 
Material and Data to be accessioned: 
 
Visit 1 (week # –3 to -1): Complete history will be taken and a physical examination will be done. 
Laboratory safety screen, height, weight, sitting blood pressure, vital signs, urine pregnancy tests, and 
urinalysis will be obtained by [CONTACT_708614]. Laboratory 
safety screen will include electrocardiogram, random blood glucose, BUN, creatinine, total bilirubin, 
electrolyte, alkaline phophatase, SGOT, and urinalysis. The presence of inclusion criteria a nd absence 
of exclusion criteria will be verified and documented on the case report form. Subjects who receive 
pharmacologic treatment of hypertension will be required to all stop antihypertensive medications for at 
least 3 weeks prior to the study. After medications are stopped for 2 weeks, these subjects will be 
asked to return to laboratory for BP check. Subjects with BP of ≥ 160/100 mmHg will be excluded from 
the study and they will be instructed to resume their medications. Subjects who are not on hypertension 
treatment during visit 1 can proceed to visit 2 without delay.  
 
Visit#2 (week #0):  Subjects who  meet inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study will undergo baseline 
evaluation during this visit. During visit 2, each subject will undergo the following procedures:  
 1) Microneurographic Recording of Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity.  Multiunit recordin gs of 
postganglionic SNA will be obtained with unipolar tungsten microelectrodes inserted selectively into 
muscle nerve fascicles of the peroneal nerves using the microneurographic technique of Valbo et al 17. 
The nerve signals are amplified, filtered (bandwidth 700 -2000 Hz), rectified and int egrated to obtain a 
mean voltage display of SNA. The criteria for an acceptable recording of muscle SNA are: 1) electrical stimulation through the microelectrode evokes twitch contractions of the peroneal muscles without 
paresthesias; 2) stretching the muscles or tendons elicits mechanoreceptor discharge; 3) the inter -burst 
interval is equal to or a multiple of the cardiac cycle length, indicating baroreceptor modulation; and 4) 
the activity increases during the decrease in arterial pressure produced by [CONTACT_708615] 
7 
July 25, 2008  7 Valsalva maneuver and decreases during the overshoot in pressure produced by [CONTACT_708616] (phase IV). Sympathetic bursts will be detected by [CONTACT_708617]. A deflection on the mean v oltage display is counted as a "burst" if it has a minimal 
signal to noise ratio of 2:1. The interobserver and intraobserver variations in identifying bursts are 
<10% and < 5% 18. When a given subject is studied on repeated occasions, the intra -subject variability 
is less than 15% 19. 
 
2) Measurement of Skeletal Muscle Oxygenation during exercise by [CONTACT_708601] (NIR) Spectroscopy:  
The NIR method is based on the principle that laser light with wavelengths in the 700 –900 nm range 
penetrates tissues with rel ative ease, and is absorbed by [CONTACT_708618] -porphyrin moieties in hemoglobin and 
myoglobin. Changes in NIR light absorption are proportional to changes in the relative concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin and myoglobin (HbO2+MbO2). To monitor the tissue abs orption of NIR light, 
two fiber optical bundles will be placed on the skin over the left flexor digitorum profundus muscle, 
which is the main muscle recruited during handgrip exercise. NIR signals at four different wavelengths 
will be sequentially sampled at a rate of 1 Hz, converted to optical densities by [CONTACT_708619], 
and stored digitally for analysis (NIRO 500, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan).  
 
Skeletal muscle oxygenation will be measured at rest and during lower body negative pre ssure 
application to evoke reflex sympathetic activation. The subject’s lower body will be enclosed in a 
negative pressure chamber to the level of the iliac crest. Pressure inside the chamber will be measured 
by a Statham transducer (Gould, Oxnard, CA). Lo wer body negative pressure (LBNP) at -20 mmHg 
simulates mild orthostatic stress (e.g., the transition from the supi[INVESTIGATOR_105524]). Then, 
subjects will be asked to perform 5 minutes of rhythmic handgrip exercise at 30% of maximal voluntary 
contr action. During the last 2 minutes of exercise, we will apply lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to 
activate sympathetic nerve activity.  
 
Blood pressure, SNA, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], handgrip force, and NIR signals will be recorded in 
response to [ADDRESS_963226]. Changes in the NIR signals in response to 
LBNP alone and LBNP plus h andgrip exercise will be expressed as a percentage of the total labile 
signal.  
 
3) Assessment of vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II:   To avoid confounding influence of sodium 
intake on BP, each subject will be given diet containing 200 mmol sodium, 100  mmol potassium, 800 
mg calcium, and 200 –300 g carbohydrate for 7 days prior to the study. On the day of the study, two 
intravenous catheters will be inserted in antecubital veins (one in each arm) for infusion of angiotensin 
II and measurement of levels o f isoprostanes, renin, and angiotensin II. Forearm blood flow (FBF) will 
be measured with high resolution Doppler Ultrasonography (Phillips HDI 5000, Bothell, WA, [LOCATION_003]) with 
a 12 MHz linear array transducer. All 2D imaging and Doppler data will be digitized into our computer 
and analyzed off -line, using an automatic wall -tracking system (Vascular Analysis Tools, 5.0, Medical 
Imaging Analysis, Coralville IA). Beat -to-beat MBV will be calculated by [CONTACT_708620]. Forearm vascular resistance (FVR) will be calculated as 
mean arterial pressure (MAP) divided by [CONTACT_161231]. BP will be measured noninvasively with 
oscillometric method (Welch Allyn, Vital Signs moitor). Cardiac output (CO)  will be m easured 
noninvasively by [CONTACT_708621] (Bioz, CardioDynamics International Corporation). Stroke volume will be derived from change in impedance/time measured during electrical systole. 
Cardiac output will be determined as the product of stroke volume and heart rate. Total peripheral 
8 
July 25, 2008  8 resistance (TPR) will be calculated by [CONTACT_708622] (MAP) by [ADDRESS_963227] by [INVESTIGATOR_609].  
 
Changes in MAP, FVR, TPR, renin, plasma F2-isoprostanes, and angiotensin II will be assess ed at 
baseline and in response to intravenous infusion angiotensin II of at the dose of 1, 2, and 3 ng/kg/min 
for 15 minutes at each dose.  
 Treatment  
After visit#2, each subject will be randomized to receive Nebivolol at the dose of 5 mg once daily or 
Meto prolol succinate (Toprol XL) 100 mg once daily.  
 
Visit#3 (4 weeks later):  Subjects will return for BP check. If BP is < 90/60 mmHg or resting heart rate < 
50 bpm, the dose of drug will be reduced by 50%. If BP > 130/80, the dose of Nebivolol will be increa sed to 10 mg and Toprol XL will be increased to 200 mg once daily.  
 
Visit#4 (4 weeks later):  Subjects will return for BP check. If BP is < 90/60 mmHg or resting heart rate < 
50 bpm, the dose of drug will be reduced by 50%. If BP > 130/80, the dose of Nebiv olol will be 
increased to 20 mg and Toprol XL will be increased to 300 mg once daily.  
 
Visit#5 (4 weeks later):  Subjects will return for measurement of SNA and skeletal muscle oxygenation 
at rest, during LBNP, and during exercise plus LBNP. Measurement of MAP, FVR, TPR, renin, plasma 
isoprostanes, and angiotensin II at baseline and in response to intravenous infusion angiotensin II of at 
the dose of 1, 2, and 3 ng/kg/min each for 15 minutes at each dose will be repeated as outlined in visit 
#2. Then the med ications will be stopped for [ADDRESS_963228]. 
12,20 
 Visit#6 (2 weeks later):  Subjects will return for measurement of MAP, FVR, TPR, renin, plasma 
isoprostanes, and angiotensin II at baseline only. Then subjects will be given BP medications in the remaining arm (either Toprol XL 100 mg once daily or Nebivolol at the dose of 5 mg once daily).  
 
Visit#7 (4 weeks later):  Subjects will return for BP check. If BP is < 90/60 mmHg or resting heart rate < 
50 bpm, the dose of drug will be reduced by 50%. If BP  > 130/80, the dose of Nebivolol will be 
increased to 10 mg and Toprol XL will be increased to 200 mg once daily.  
 
Visit#8 (4 weeks later):  Subjects will return for BP check. If BP is < 90/60 mmHg or resting heart rate < 
50 bpm, the dose of drug will be re duced by 50%. If BP > 130/80, the dose of Nebivolol will be 
increased to 20 mg and Toprol XL will be increased to 300 mg once daily.  
 
Visit#9 (4 weeks later):  Subjects will return for measurement of SNA and skeletal muscle oxygenation 
at rest, during LBNP,  and during exercise plus LBNP. Measurement of MAP, FVR, TPR, renin, plasma 
isoprostanes, and angiotensin II at baseline and in response to intravenous infusion angiotensin II of at 
the dose of 0.5, 1, and 3 ng/kg/min for 30 minutes at each dose will be re peated as outlined in visit #2 
and 5. End of study.  
 
Potential Risks:  
The potential risks are related to: a) microneurography, b) venous cannulation, c) intravenous infusion 
of angiotensin II, d) administration of nebivolol and metoprolol, e) lower body ne gative pressure, f) 
handgrip exercise and forearm circulatory arrest during inflation of a pneumatic cuff.  
 
9 
July 25, 2008  9 a) The potential risks of microneurography: 10% of subjects may experience transient leg tiredness, or 
increase sensitivity to touch (hyperesthesia) , motor weakness in the leg lasting less than 1 week. Since 
1979, microneurography has been performed on more than several thousand subjects without 
permanent complications related to procedure.  
 b) The risks of intravenous catheters are infection, bleedin g, and vasovagal reaction.  
  
c) The potential risks of infusing i.v. angiotensin II (IND # 53,558) are hypertension and hypokalemia 
with chronic infusion.  
 d) The potential risks of nebivolol and metoprolol are hypotension, bradycardia, fatigue, dizziness, and 
depression.  
 e) Potential risks of lower body negative pressure application is vasovagal syncope if negative pressure is applied at -[ADDRESS_963229] level of  –20 mmHg for less than 5 minutes. Therefore, vasovagal syncope is 
unlikely to occur.  
 f) Potential risks of handgrip exercise and forearm circulatory arrest during inflation of a pneumatic cuff 
are muscle ache or cramp.  
 
Protection Against Risks:  
 a) Micr oneurography will be performed under the supervision of [CONTACT_227691] who has extensive 
experience.  A stimulus isolation unit (special electronic circuit) will be used to prevent electrocution 
from the recording apparatus. Subjects will be given a mic roneurographic questionnaire to report any 
adverse reactions occurring up to one week after the study.  
 
b) All subjects will have a routine history and physical examination performed by [CONTACT_099] -
investigators. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708588].  
 
c) ACLS -certified personnel, will be present during all experiments. Resuscitative equipment and drugs 
will be available in the laboratory. Blood pressure and the subject’s heart rate will be monit ored 
continuously during the microneurographic experiments. Infusions of angiotensin II will be discontinued 
if mean arterial pressure decreases or increases by [CONTACT_726] 20 mmHg above the baseline level.  
 d) During treatment with antihypertensive medicati on with Nebivolol and Metoprolol, patients will be 
seen at the cardiovascular physiology research laboratory for monitoring of BP.   
 
e) Venous cannulation will be performed by [CONTACT_708623], Debbie Arbique, RN.  
 
Procedures to Maintain  Confidentiality   
1.  Information will be given only to the physician -investigators.   
2.  The nature of the information concerns pertinent medical and social history.  
3. The purpose of the disclosure is solely for research purposes, in particular to determine whether 
potential subjects meet criteria for inclusion or exclusion and to identify specific subgroups of subjects.     
4.  The subject’s right of confidentiality will be given strict priority. No mention of the subjects’ identities will be made eith er directly or indirectly in oral or written presentation of this work. The investigators, 
who are physicians, will be responsible for providing medical care in the event of any adverse effects to the subjects.  
[ADDRESS_963230]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_708589], as well as the experimental log book, will be kept in a locked file cabinet in our res earch 
laboratory.

Statistical Methods   
SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) statistical software will be used fo r statistical analyses, particularly 
PROC MIXED for linear models.  Model assumptions such as normality and covariance structure will be 
carefully assessed.  Data transformations or nonparametric tests may be performed to meet analysis assumptions. Hypothe sis tests will be two- sided using the 0.05 significance level.   Bonferroni type 
adjustments for multiple testing will be implemented to control Type I errors as necessary.  
 
Sample size, power estimates, statistical method  
Power calculations were based on  the within -person variability of the angiotensin II infusion rate 
required to raise mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg (Pd20). These values were previously 
determined by [CONTACT_708626]  21. Normotensive men had intra -individual 
coefficients of variation that averaged 18% for angiotensin II 21. Assuming a greater BP varia bility in 
hypertensive patients’ of approximately 25%, it was estimated that a crossover study of [ADDRESS_963233] 80% certainty of demonstrating a 15% difference in cardiovascular reactivity between 
nebovolol and toprol XL at the alpha level of 0.05 . 
 
To allow for 25% attrition during the study, total of 25 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Treatment 
order will be randomized using blocked randomization.  
 
Statistical method: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the responses over inf usion time for 
each phase of this study. To compare responses between the study phases, repeated measure 
analysis of variance models with repeated factors for both study phase and infusion time will be 
constructed. Polynomial contrasts will be constructed to compare the linear trends or slope of the MAP, 
TPR, and FVR responses to infusion of Ang II over time  between the study phases.  A between group 
factor will be included in these models to assess treatment order effects.  A mixed linear model approach wi ll be used for repeated measures analysis that allows flexibility in the specification of the 
covariance structure over time and can accommodate missing data in most situations.  
 
Gender/Minority Analysis: 
 
Inclusion of Women 
Approximately 50% of our subje cts will be women.  
 
Inclusion of Minorities 
We are over -sampling non -Hispanic Blacks because (1) prevalence of hypertension in the U.S. are 
higher in blacks than nonblacks, (2) the class of drugs we are studying is thought in general to be more 
effective in lowering blood pressure in blacks than other ethnic groups. Our aim is to obtain a 50:50 split 
in ethnicity between non -Hispanic blacks (“blacks”) and all other ethnicities (“non -blacks”). The non -
black group will be ~60% white, 35% Hispanic, and 5% oth er.  
 
Inclusion of Children  
12 
July 25, 2008  12 Children will not be included because: (1) the safety of microneurography in children has not been 
established and children are not likely to undergo successful microneurographic procedure which 
requires staying still in bed wh ile keepi[INVESTIGATOR_708596] 3 -4 hours to allow adequate 
nerve recording, (2) the safety of administration of angiotensin II is unknown, and 3) children are much 
more likely to have secondary hypertension than adults.

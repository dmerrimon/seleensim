Name [CONTACT_790]/Company: Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
Device Name: [CONTACT_440513]-100 and BES-100 
Study Intervention:  Virtual Reality Intervention  
Study Number : BVR -100-102 
Title of Study: BVR -100 and BES-100 Validation Trial: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel-
Group, Controlled Study of Two At- Home Self -Guided Virtual Reality Interventions for Adults with 
Social Anxiety Disorder. 
Proposed Indication: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)  
Study Centers: Approximate ly 4 clinical sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  
Phase of Development: Pre -Launch 
Study Objectives:  
The objective of this study is to compare two Virtual Reality (VR) -based interventions, BVR-100 and 
BES-100, for the treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder (SA D). 
Primary:  
To evaluate the credibility and expectation of benefit of BVR-100 and BES-100 for subjects with SAD , 
as measured with the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ).  
Secondary:  
• To evaluate subject retention and time -on-task of BVR-100 and BES -100. 
Exploratory:  
• To explore subjects' experiences and acceptability of BVR -100 and BES-100 in a qualitative 
interview.  
• To evaluate the therapeutic response of the two interventions for SAD on: 
o Fear and avoidance symptoms, as measured by [CONTACT_15370] -administered Liebowitz Social 
Anxiety Scale (LSAS)  
o Overall symptomatology and functioning, using the Clinical Global Impression Severity 
scale (CGI -S), the Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I), and the Patient 
Global Impression Improvement scale (PGI -I). 
o Depression symptoms, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9). 
Safety: 
• To evaluate the safety of BVR-100 and BES-100, as measured by: 
o Incidence of adverse events (AEs), 
o Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs),  
o Incidence of unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs), and  
o The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).  
Study Design:  
This is a parallel -group, double -blind (subject and investigators/outcome assessors), randomized, 
controlled, decentralized, study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the credibility and acceptability, 
subject retention, and time -on-task of BVR -100 and BES-100 in a sample of subjects with Social 
Anxiety Disorder (SAD).

Study Visits  
Screening and Washout 
Informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any study- specific procedures are 
performed. Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility during a screening phase of up to 14 days. 
Psychiatric history will be reviewed, and diagnoses will be confirmed by [CONTACT_079] ( PI) 
or designee using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Prior experience with 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (ie, including questions about experiences with in- imagination or 
in-vivo exposure to fearful situations), use of concomitant medications and substance use, and baseline 
characteristics (ie, social anxiety symptoms measured with the LSAS, depression symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_127659]-9, and suicidal ideation and behavior measured wit h the C -SSRS ) will be 
assessed at Screening. Subjects will be asked to wash -out from disallowed psychotropic medications or 
herbal supplements during the Screening period. A seven -day extension to the Screening period may 
be allowed with Medical Monitor approval. 
Subjects who screen fail due to temporary resolvable medical conditions unrelated to psychiatric entry criteria, or logistical issues with Screening procedures, may be re-screened up to two times if judged 
appropriate by [CONTACT_737], after dis cussion and agreement with the Medical Monitor. Re- screened 
subjects will be re-consented, assigned a new subject number, and all Visit [ADDRESS_558554] are verified. Subjects will be randomly 
allocated to either the treatm ent group (BVR- 100) or the control (BES -100) group. Randomization will 
be assigned via an interactive web responses system (IWRS) in a 1:[ADDRESS_558555]’s 
address. Subjects will not be informed of their intervention allocation. In order to secure subject 
blinding, subjects will have no prior experience with CBT. Subjects will be instructed not to share 
descriptions of the intervention they are rece iving with investigator site staff  during visits and 
discouraged from discussing details of the therapy outside the study. The Baseline visit will be 
scheduled to occur within 5 -7 days of the randomization visit, to allow adequate time for VR device 
delive ry/receipt. If, due to delays with device delivery/receipt, an extension beyond the [ADDRESS_558556] part of the B aseline visit, a 
telehealth call will be performe d with investigator site staff who will administer Baseline visit (Day 1) 
assessments including clinician -administered outcome measures (C -SSRS, LSAS, CGI -S), collect any 
adverse events (AEs), concomitant medication changes, and facilitate the delivery of Patient Reported 
Outcomes (PROs; PHQ -9). During the second part of the Baseline visit, after the call with the 
investigator site staff  is completed, subjects will receive access to a video -guided VR onboarding 
session providing information to set- up the VR  headset, guidance for the initial sign-up, and 
information about the intervention the subject has been allocated to. This session will be completed by 
[CONTACT_440461]. However, subjects will be able to 
reach out to a designated unblinded site support team  for any assistance/guidance during the video-
guided onboarding session or at any time thereafter. The designated unblinded site support team will 
ensure that both the video- onboarding and the first VR session are completed. After completing the 
video-guided onboarding and the first VR session, subjects will be asked to complete the CEQ.  
Week 1 – Week [ADDRESS_558557] . In addition 
to the required practices, subjects will be encouraged to also engage with optional content and to 
review content completed in previous sessions. Engagement with both study interventions will be 
monitored on a regular basis and notifications will be sent regularly to remind subjects to engage with 
the interventions . Unscheduled telehealth visits to complete/perform  additional safety assessments may 
be conducted as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_10590] /subject.  
During Weeks 1 (aside from the Baseline visit), 3, 5, and 7, there will be no study assessments, or 
scheduled telehealth calls with investigator site staff completed.  
After the VR sessions have been completed, subjects are requested to complete the Pati ent-Reported 
Outcomes ( PROs) (PHQ-9, PGI-I, and CEQ) as applicable to each particular week, electronically as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments. The scales should be reviewed on a bi -weekly basis, to 
ensure completeness, for any potential AEs that  may be reported, and retraining provided to subjects as 
necessary. During the last 3  days of Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 (End of Study [ EOS]/Early Termination 
[ET]), investigator site staff  will conduct telehealth study visits to collect clinician -administered 
outcome measures (C -SSRS, LSAS, CGI -S, CGI -I), AEs and concomitant medication changes. For the 
Week 8 (EOS/ET) visit, an additional qualitative interview with a member of the unblinded site 
support team will occur to explore each subjects’ experience with their respective interventions 
(BVR -100 or BES-100). All attempts will be made to ensure that each subject is assessed by [CONTACT_440462]. In the event that 
subjects require techni cal support or further program instructions, support will be provided by [CONTACT_440463].  
All AE data will be collected by [CONTACT_440464] -ins and recorded in the 
electronic data capt ure (EDC). Subjects will be provided with contact [CONTACT_440465]/Investigator in order to help address potential safety 
issues that may arise and to facilitate AE reporting.

Study Intervention:  
BVR -100 is a non-invasive, self-guided, at-home, VR intervention co-developed by [CONTACT_440467]. and 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. that is being developed for the treatment of SAD. BVR-100 offers 
educational modules and immersive environments created using both computer- generated and 360º 
videos. BVR-100 is delivered via consumer- grade 6 degrees -of-freedom (DoF) VR  Head Mounted 
Device (HMD). The intervention includes immersive and automated VR experienc es that guide the 
user through educational and experiential learning modules.  
It is intended as an 8-week program with a recommended minimum frequency of 3 weekly sessions. Each session will be approximately 5-20 minutes long (depending on type and amount of content 
experienced).  
Mode of Administration:  
BVR -100 will be delivered via the VR headset. Enrolled subjects in the study will be asked to register 
in the VR headset using their phone number and to create a log-in PIN code which will be used for subsequent sign- ins.  
Duration of Study : The total dur ation of subject participation in investigational intervention use is 
approximately 8 weeks (Baseline/Week  1 through Week  8/EOS). Altogether, this study will last 
approximately 11 weeks from Screening through EOS. 
 
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.00  BVR -100 
Confidential and Proprietary 9 21 June 2023 Reference Therapy : 
BES-100 is a non -invasive, self -guided, multisession, at -home, VR intervention designed to be used as 
a sham control condition for the evaluation of BVR- 100 in the treatment of SAD. BVR -100 and 
BES-100 are comparable in all technological, design, and programmatic chara cteristics, except for the 
mechanisms of action.   
The computer -generated environment will be interactive to increase engagement and provide subjects 
with a similar interactive experience as BVR -100. 
BES-100 is intended as an 8-week program with a recommended minimum frequency of 3 weekly 
sessions, In addition to the 3 weekly sessions, users can review any already experienced modules or 
engage with the distraction module at any point during the program. Each session will be approximately 5-20 minutes long.  
Concomitant Medications: Prior medications, including the use of psychotropic medication taken 
during the previous 12 months, and any other medication taken during the previous 3 months will be 
recorded at Screening. Details on all medications taken prior to Screening (including dosing changes) 
will be recorded based on subject report.  
Thereafter, any changes in concomitant medications or new medications added until the end of study will be recorded. At a minimum, the following information on prior and conc omitant medications will 
be recorded on the case report form (CRF): medication name, dose, frequency, route, start date and 
time, stop date and time, and indication. 
Prohibited Medications  
Psychotropic medications and medications with a propensity for psyc hotropic effects are not permitted 
during the study participation, except as discussed below (see Allowed Concomitant Psychotropic 
Medication). Subjects will be requested to refrain from using benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] ( eg, clonazepam and 
bromazepam) for the duration of their participation in the study. The use of herbal supplements, dietary supplements or other complementary or alternative medications for treating psychiatric indications, as 
well as nutritional supplements and nonprescription herbal preparations wit h CNS effects (eg, St. 
John’s Wort, omega -3 fatty acids, kava extracts, gamma-aminobutyric acid supplements, cannabidiol, 
etc) are not permitted during the study participation. Disallowed psychotropic medications must be washed out during the screening/washout period and fully discontinued a minimum of 3 days or 
5 half -lives (whichever is longer) prior to randomization. Disallowed herbal supplements with CNS-
related indications must be fully discontinued a minimum of [ADDRESS_558564].  
Treatment of Insomnia  
Concomitant use of eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123], zaleplon, zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_440439] r estrictions:  
• eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123] (≤  3 mg/day), zopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123] (≤  7.5 mg/day), zaleplon (≤  20 mg/day), zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] 
(≤ 10 mg/day), and zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_216326] (≤  12.5 mg/day) may be administered at bedtime for 
insomnia, not exceeding 3 instances per week.  
Diphenhydramine ≤  100 mg/day and melatonin ≤  10 mg/day may be administered at bedtime for 
insomnia, as needed. Over-the-counter melatonin may be used. Combination melatonin products are 
not allowed. 
Medications that are used for insomnia should be administered no more than once nightly and should 
not be used in combination.  
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.[ADDRESS_558565] dose of any concomitant psychotropic medication(s) taken prior to 
scheduled effectiveness assessments must be recorded at each visit. Subjects should be encouraged to 
avoid taking any psychotropic medication (or any agents that may cause sedation) within 12 hours of 
effectiveness assessments.  
Allowed Concomitant Non -Psychotropic Medications 
Non-psychotropic medications used to treat stable, chronic medical conditions or for short-t erm 
treatment of an acute medical condition may be used during screening and throughout participation. 
Use of non- prescription pain medications ( eg, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], acetaminophen/paracetamol) are allowed during 
all phases of the study. 
Subjects will be requested to refrain from using benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] ( eg, clonazepam and bromazepam) 
and acute use of beta‐ blockers (eg, atenolol, propranolol) for the duration of their participation in the 
study. Individuals who have had a stable use of beta- blockers for cardiac indications are acceptable for 
this study. Subjects will be requested to refrain from use of alcohol, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for any purpose 
while taking part in the study. 
The use of any concomitant medication or other psychotropic drug use will be assessed  and registered 
during all scheduled telephone visits. 
All medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD).  
Criteria for Evaluation: Primary Endpoint : 
• The measurement of intervention credibility and expectancy of benefit, assessed with the 
Credibility / Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) scores, at B aseline, Week 6, and W eek 8/ EOS . 
o The Credibility / Expectancy Questionnaire ( Devilly -2000) asks about the improvements 
that subjects believe will be achieved as a result of treatment, and how believable, convincing, and logical the treatment seems. It contains 6 items rated on a 1–9 or a 
0%-100% scale. The first three items of the scale load o nto the credibility factor and the 
final three items load onto the expectancy factor.  
Secondary Endpoints : 
• Subject retention in each group will be assessed by [CONTACT_440468] 6 and Week 8 (EOS) . Reasons for dropout will be documented. 
• Time -on-task, averaged over all VR sessions, will be assessed at  Week 6 and Week 8/ EOS . 
Time on task will be automatically recorded by [CONTACT_440469]. 
Other/Exploratory Endpoints:  
• The overview of qualitative input obtained during qualitative interviews at W eek 8.  
• The mean change from baseline in LSAS scores at Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8. 
• The proportion of “responders”, that is, subject who are rated 1 (very much improvement) or 2 (much improvement) in the CGI -I at end -of-treatment ( Week 8) 
• The mean change from baseline in CGI- S score at Week  2, Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8. 
• The mean change from baseline in PGI- I score at Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, and Week  8. 
• The mean change from baseline in PHQ- 9 score at Week  2, Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8. 
Safety Endpoints : 
• Incidence of adverse events (AEs). 
• Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs).  
• Incidence of unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs).  
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.00  BVR -100 
Confidential and Proprietary 11 21 June 2023 • Frequency of sub jects with suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior based on the C -SSRS.  
Statistical Methods:  
All analyses will be based on the modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT) population, which includes all 
subjects who are randomized, have completed at least one VR session, and have Baseline and at least 
one post- Baseline effectiveness measurement in CEQ . Additional analysis of the Per- Protocol (PP) 
population is supportive. The safety assessments will use the Safety population, which includes all 
subjects who are randomiz ed and have completed at least one VR session.  
No formal hypothesis testing relating to primary or exploratory outcomes is planned because this is a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be presented descriptively as 
proporti ons or as means with standard deviations. Descriptive statistics will be used to estimate group 
differences in the CEQ at baseline and at Week 6 and W eek 8, retention rates at W eek 6 and W eek 8, 
and time -on-task at W eek 6 and W eek 8. Likewise, descriptive statistics will be used to assess 
differences in the mean change from baseline in the LSAS, CGI -S and PHQ -9 at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8; 
differences in the mean change from CGI -S baseline score in the CGI -I and PGI-I at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 
8; and proportion of subjects with a “responder” status at the end of treatment at week 8. Single 
imputation techniques will be employed for all missing data.  
Exploratorily, CEQ scores differences between groups will be computed using Student’s t tests, and 
associations between CEQ scores and both baseline variables and clinical outcomes will be  analyzed. 
Between -group differences in LSAS and responder status rates will be analyzed using Student’s t  tests 
and chi- squared tests, respectively. Basel ine demographic and clinical characteristics will be compared 
between groups with the use of the two sample  t-test and the Mann –Whitney test for continuous 
measurements with and without normal distribution, respectively. 
Safety data regarding AEs  (including SAEs and UADEs ) will be collected from the start date/time of 
informed consent form ( ICF) consent  to the EOS/ET, and summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Adverse 
events, AEs leading to discontinuation, serious AEs, and UADEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1601], 
for each treatment group, the number and percentage of subjects with any AEs, and AEs by [CONTACT_53428]. Adverse events will be further summarized by [CONTACT_440470].  
Sample Size:  
Due to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_109248], no formal sample size calculations will be conducted. However, to 
ensure a reliable estimate of the standard deviations to power a future trial with 90% and an expected 
effect size between 0.3 and 0.7, fifteen people p er arm are recommended ( Whitehead -2016). In order to 
account for a possible attrition rate of 25%, twenty people per arm (total n = 40) will be recruited. In 
order to ensure  adequate data for evaluation, early discontinued subjects may be replaced at Sponsor 
discretion.

 4. INTRODUCTION 
The objective of this study is to compare two Virtual Reality (VR) -based interventions, 
BVR -100 and BES-100, for the treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). 
4.1. Background  
Social anxieties and fears exist along a continuum of intensity, ranging from mild phenomena 
such as shyness to psychopathological levels of fear and anxiety that can be classified as social anxiety disorder (SAD) ( McNeil -2014). SAD is characterized by [CONTACT_440471] -consciousness in everyday social situations, which causes significant distress and 
often leads to impairment in important areas of functioning ( American Psychiatric Association -
2013). It affects 7% of the population and has a high comorbidity with other anxiety, affective, 
and substance-use disorders ( Kessler -2005). SAD is associated with increased healthcare 
utiliz ation and a range of indirect costs relating to reduced productivity, social impairment, and 
reduction in quality of life ( Konnopka-2000).  
SAD can be a chronic and naturally unremitting disorder if not treated adequately. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_440440], only about half of adults with the disorder ever seek treatment ( Grant -2005). Guidelines from the National Institu te for Health and Care Excellence 
recommend individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as the first- line treatment for adults 
with social anxiety ( Mayo -Wilson -2014). Standard treatment g uidelines and evidence- based 
CBT tools for social anxiety include exposure, cognitive restructuring, social skills training and 
relaxation training (Mayo- Wilson - 2014; National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health 
([LOCATION_006]) -2015 ). Studies of group, individual, and internet- based CBT for the treatment of SAD have 
demonstrated response rates between 58 and 75% ( Blanco -2010; Butler -2021; Dryman -2017; 
Loerinc-2015 ) and remission rates around 40% ( Springer-2018). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_440441], and in particular exposure therapy, only a minority of individuals receive this 
treatment ( Freiheit -2004; McAleavey -2014; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_440442] -2019; Sars -2015).  
Virtual reality (VR) technology offers a unique opportunity to disseminate CBT and exposure therapy. Studies indicate that patients prefer to receive VR exposure therapy (VRET) to traditional exposure therapy ( Garcia- Palacios -2007). VRET has large effect sizes 
(Kampmann -2016; Wechsler -2019) and may be particularly useful for those who show 
reluctance toward completing in vivo or imaginal exposure. VRET may be useful in addressing the shortcomings of established methods of exposure, particularly in relation to cost-
effectiveness, convenience, treatment acceptability, treatment availability and accessibility, and 
difficulties with patients visualizing scenes during imaginal exposure ( Emmelkamp -2020; 
Morina-2021).  
While the use of VRET has been extensively researched, delivering cognitive components of CBT using VR is a novel and promising approach ( Bolinski-2021; Lindner-2019). Combining 
the use of immersive and self -guided interventions, patients can learn effective cognitive 
techniques to counter automatic anxious thoughts, a central cause of anxiety maintenance and treatment according to cognitive perspectives ( Clark -1999). Similarly, mindfulness and 
acceptance- based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_440443], often combined 
with traditional CBT techniques ( Liu-2021; Norton-2015). Because of its potential to shield 
subjects’ attention from distraction and induce strong feelings of presence, VR can enhance the 
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.00 BVR -100 
Confidential and Proprietary 23 21 June 2023 
 practices of mindfulness and facilitate emotion regulation therefore reducing symptoms of 
anxiety ( Navarro -Haro -2019; Seabrook-2020). Furthermore, VR may be combined with 
engaging game-design mechanics to deliver highly automated unguided interventions, thus 
showing an enormous potential for improving public health due to its cost- effectiveness and 
scalability.  
The current study will  test BVR -100, a VR- based multi- session, self -led intervention for social 
anxiety symptoms including CBT techniques against BES-100, a VR-based intervention intended as a control- arm for BVR -100. 
4.2. Study Conduct Rationale  
Digital therapeutics (DTx) are evidence-based software products used to prevent, manage, or treat medical conditions. DTx need to adhere to the same standards of evidence and regulatory 
oversight as prescription medications and traditional medical devices. However, DTx face 
additional challenges to establishing appropriate control conditions that support evidence-generation in randomized controlled trials (RCT). In particular, DTx interventions are subject to 
“digital placebo” effects, involving technology- related non -specific effects (eg , beliefs about 
technology, design of the hardware and software, information provided, medium of delivery, 
time-on-task, etc.), that are not present in drug trials ( Torous-2016). Furthermore, DTx 
delivering psychological interventions such as CBT are faced with the additional challenge of controlling for more complex placebo effects that typi[INVESTIGATOR_440444], such as the effect of the frequency and intensity of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]–patient interactions. 
While the FDA acknowledges that “it may be challenging to construct a placebo control that 
appears to function like the investigational device but delivers no therapy ” (Center for Devices 
& Radiological Health, n.d.), it is still recommended that Sponsors evaluate placebos in terms of 
their face- validity (ie, time -on-task), blinding, and subject retention. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_440445] -[ADDRESS_558578] a “sham” control such as BES -[ADDRESS_558579]  blinding. In line with FDA recommendations, study endpoints 
will also include an evaluation of time -on-task and drop- out rates (also referred to as s ubject 
retention) at end -of-study (EOS). Like the subsequent RCT, this 8- week, 2-arm, double-blinded 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_440446]-100 and BVR-100 interventions. Subjects meeting the 
diagnostic criteria for SAD and a Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale ( LSAS ) score at Screening of 
≥ [ADDRESS_558580], SAD fear and avoidance symptoms and overall symptom improvement will 
be assessed using the LSAS and the CGI scales, in addition to the self- reported PGI -I. Self -
reported and clinician -administered assessments will be administered at Baseline, Week 2, Week 
4, Week 6, and Week  8 (EOS) . 
Because of the exploratory nature of the study, no formal hypothesis testing will be used to 
assess clinical benefit (or lack thereof). The sample size is intended to support the reliable evaluation of treatment credibility, time -on-task, and drop-out rates across study arms. 
Justification for Intervention Parameters  
Given the scientific rigor required in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_440447]- based BVR -100 
intervention, we chose to design a stringent control condition –as opposed to less stringent 
controls such as waitlist controls – that allows us to more appropriately control for expectation 
effects and minimize s ubject unblinding. The BES-100 has been specifically developed as a 
“sham” for BVR -100. A sham is a medical device that is thought to be ineffective and is 
equivalent of a placebo control in pharmacological trials. FDA guidance indicates that sham- or 
placebo -controlled trials provide internal evidence of assay sensitivity and allow to interpret 
differences between intervention and sham groups without reference to external findings, thus 
providing robust evidence of effectiveness: “where there may be a placebo effect with the use of 
a device, the comparison of the results of use of the device with an ineffective device used under conditions designed to resemble the conditions of use under investigation as far as possible ” 
(Center for Devices & Radiological Health, n.d.; Center for Drug Evaluation & Research, n.d.). 
In order to design an inert sham intervention with no or minimal therapeutic effects, the critical 
mechanisms of action in BVR-[ADDRESS_558581] practice framework by [CONTACT_440472] (VR -CORE) committee ( Birckhead -2019), BES -[ADDRESS_558582] a similar user interface and graphic quality thus ensuring 
that usability does not differ substantially across interventions . As BVR -100, BES-100 will offer 
a combination of non- immersive 2D audiovisual content as well as fully immersive and active 
VR experiences. Thus, BES- 100 will control for critical factors related to the user experience in 
VR while offering a similar look and feel as BVR -100. Special care will be taken to ensure that 
BES-100 has a similar amount and variety of prescribed content as BVR-100, such that expected 
time-on-task during the intervention is similar across conditions.  
The combination of modules delivering educational content (general health and neuroscience clips) and interactive and immersive activities are expected to result in a minimally therapeutic 
yet credible intervention that results in a similar usage and subject retention during the 
interve ntion, ultimately promoting subject blinding to the treatment assignment.  
4.4. Benefit-Risk  
While there may not be any direct benefit of BVR-100/BES -[ADDRESS_558583] benefit to patients with SAD in the future. 
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.00 BVR -100 
Confidential and Proprietary 25 21 June 2023 
 The VR interventions are  non-invasive, and risks associated with exposure to the interventions 
are generally expected to be transitory.  
Potential risks of VR include, but are not limited to: motion sickness, blurry vision, eye strain, 
headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea. The use of VR can cause loss of situational awareness leading to a potential for injury. 
The study VR intervention is intended to engage subjects with stimuli that may elicit some 
discomfort . As a result, these stimuli may cause anxiety. While considered unlikely, it is 
possible that the stimuli could trigger a panic attack in some subjects. In such cases, subjects will 
be instructed to temporarily remove the VR  headset . 
VR-related effects as well as anxiety elicited by [CONTACT_440473]. Should the VR experience become too uncomfortable, subjects can remove the VR headset and disengage fro m the VR intervention. 
Any such events would be subject to standard adverse event (AE) reporting practices. Subjects 
are free to withdraw consent from participation in the study at any time. Similarly, should the 
Investigator determine that it is unsafe fo r a subject to continue in the study at any time, the 
subject should be discontinued.

Details of the study assessments and other procedures to be performed at each week are 
presented in Table 2, Schedule of Assessments, and Section  11 , Study Assessments. The total 
study duration will be approximately 11 weeks from Screening through EOS  (Week 8).  
Screening and Washout 
Informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any study- specific procedures are 
performed. Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility during a screening phase of up to 14 days: 
Psychiatric history will be reviewed, and diagnoses will be confirmed by [CONTACT_9532] ( PI) or designee using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). 
Prior experience with CBT therapy (ie, including questions about experiences with in-
imagination or in -vivo exposure to fearful situations), use of concomitant medications and 
substance use, and baseline characteristics (ie, social anxiety symptoms measured with the LSAS, depression symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_127659]-9, and suicidal ideation and behavior measured with the Columbia Suicide Severity  Rating Scale [C- SSRS]) will be assessed at 
Screening. Subjects will be asked to wash-out from disallowed psychotropic medications or 
herbal supplements during the screening period. A seven -day extension to the screening period 
may be allowed with Medical Monitor approval. 
Subjects who screen fail due to temporary resolvable medical conditions unrelated to psychiatric entry criteria, or logistical issues with Screening procedures, may be re-screened up to two times if judged appropriate by [CONTACT_737], after discussion and agreement with the Medical 
Monitor. Re- screened subjects will be re-consented, assigned a new subject number, and all 
Visit [ADDRESS_558584] are verified. Subjects will be 
randomly allocated to either the treatment group (BVR-100) or the control (BES-100) group. 
Randomization will be assigned via an interactive web responses system (IWRS) in a 1:[ADDRESS_558585]’s address. Subjects will not be informed of their intervention allocation. In order to secure subjects blinding, subjects will have no prior experience with CBT. Subjects will be instructed not to share descriptions of the intervention they are receiving with  
investigator site staff  during visits and discouraged from discussing details of the therapy outside 
the study. The Baseline visit will be scheduled to occur within 5-7 days of the randomization 
visit, to allow adequate time for VR de vice delivery/receipt. However, it could occur earlier if 
the device is received earlier. If, due to delays with device delivery/receipt, an extension beyond 
the [ADDRESS_558586] part of the Baseline visit, a telehealth call will be performed with the investigator site  staff who will administer Baseline 
visit (Day 1) assessments including clinician -administered outcome measures (C -SSRS, LSAS, 
CGI-S), collect any adverse events (AEs), concomitant medication changes, and facilitate the 
delivery of Patient Reported Outcome s (PROs; PHQ-9). During the second part, after the call 
with the investigator site staff  is completed , subjects will receive access to a video -guided VR 
onboarding session providing information to set-up the VR headset, guidance for the initial sign-up, an d information about the intervention the subject has been allocated to. This session will be 
completed by [CONTACT_440476]. However, 
subjects will be able to reach out to an unblinded site support team for any assistance/guidance 
during the video-guided onboarding session or at any time thereafter. The unblinded site support team  will ensure that both the video-onboarding and the first VR session are completed. After 
completing the video-guided onboarding and the first VR session, subject s will be asked to 
complete the CEQ.  
Week 1- Week  [ADDRESS_558587] . In addition to the required practices, subjects will be encouraged to also engage with 
optional content and to review content completed in previous sessions. Engagement with both

Confidential and Proprietary 30 21 June 2023 
 study interventions will be monitored on a regular basis and notifications will be sent regularly to 
remind subjects to engage with the interventions. Unscheduled telehealth to complete/perform 
additional safety ass essments be conducted as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_440477]/subject.  
During Weeks 1 (aside from the Baseline visit), 3, 5, and 7, there will be no study assessments, or scheduled telehealth calls  with investigator site staff completed.  
After the VR sessions have been completed, subjects are requested to complete the PROs 
(PHQ -9, PGI-I, and CEQ) as applicable to each particular week , electronically as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments. The scales should be reviewed on a bi- weekly basis, to ensure 
completeness, for any potential AEs that may be reported, and retraining provided to subjects as necessary. During the last 3 days of Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 (EOS/ET), investigator site staff will 
conduct telehealth study visits to collect clin ician -administered outcome measures (C -SSRS, 
LSAS, CGI -S, CGI-I), AEs and concomitant medication changes. For the Week 8 (EOS/ET) 
visit, an additional qualitative  interview with  a member of  the unblinded site support team will 
occur  to explore each subjects ’ experience with their respective interventions (BVR-100 or 
BES-100). All attempts will be made to ensure that each subject is assessed by [CONTACT_440478]. In the event tha t 
subjects require technical support or further program instructions, support will be provided by [CONTACT_440479]. 
All AE data will be collected by [CONTACT_440480] -ins and recorded in the 
electronic data capture ( EDC ). Subjects will be provided with contact [CONTACT_440481]/Investigator in order to help address 
potential safety issues that may arise and to facilitate AE rep orting. 
7.2. Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
7.2.1. Treatment Assignment  
All enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned to either the treatment (BVR -100) or control 
(BES -100) group. After Screening, subjects deemed eligible by [CONTACT_440482]. Randomization will occur after confirmation of eligibility and continued subject interest are verified. Subjects will be randomly allocated to either the treatment group (BVR -100) or the 
control (BES-100) group. Randomization will be assigned via an interactive web responses system (IWRS) in a 1:1 ratio to either BVR -100 or to BES-100. 
Once a randomization number has been assigned, it cannot be reused. The randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_10981], non- study biostatistician.  
7.2.2. Blinding  
Subjects, Investigators, investigator site staff, persons performing the assessments, clinical operations personnel, data analysts, will remain blinded to the identity of the VR intervention from the time of randomization until database lock and unblinding, using the following methods: 
• Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding in the IWRS, and will not be accessible by [CONTACT_440483]100 -102, Version 1.00 BVR -100 
Confidential and Proprietary 31 21 June 2023 
 following exceptions: Unblinded site support team to support the subjects with any 
technical VR device issues and performing qualitative interview, pharmacovigilance 
department for evaluation and reporting of UADEs, SAEs, and any other AEs of clinical interest.  
• The identity of the interventions will be concealed by [CONTACT_440484] e 
all identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration and appearance. 
In order to secure subject blinding, subjects will have no prior experience with CBT. Subjects will be instructed and reminded on an ongoing basis not to share descriptions of the intervention they are receiving in any capacity with  investigator site staff
 (with the exception of the 
unblinded site support team) during visits or at any point during study participation and discouraged from discussing details of the therapy outside the study. 
Investigator site staff will not be provided the details of the study intervention and various 
components/experiences  within the program beyond the broad overview that is presented in this 
protocol to minimize  any chance of unblinding. The VR device allocated to each subject upon 
randomization will be shipped directly to the subject’s address from the depot and a ny activities , 
including subject training/tech support related to the VR intervention will be managed by [CONTACT_440485], removing the investigator site  staff  from the 
entire process to minimize any chance of unblinding. 
Actual subject identity revealing actual study treatment will not be disclosed before database 
lock and study unblinding unless an emergency unblinding becomes necessary. 
7.2.3. Emergency Unblinding Procedures  
In the case of a medical emergency, where knowledge of study intervention by [CONTACT_440486], a [ADDRESS_558588] will compare both BES -100 and 
BVR -100 interventions. Subjects meeting the di agnostic criteria for SAD and a LSAS score at 
Screening of ≥  [ADDRESS_558589], SAD fear and avoidance symptoms and overall symptom improvement will be assessed using the LSAS and the CGI scales, in addition to the self-reported 
PGI-I. Self -reported and clinician -administered assessments will be administered at Baseline, 
Week  2, Week 4, Week  6, and Week 8 (end of study). 
Because of the exploratory nature of the study, no formal hypothesis testing will be used to assess clinical benefit (or lack of it). The sample size is intended to support the reliable 
evaluation of treatment credibility, time -on-task, and drop-out rates across study arms. 
7.3.2. Rationale for the Device 
BehaVR Inc.’s proprietary platform and VR environments can help s erve to reduce the logistical, 
social, and psychological barriers to traditional CBT, such as a shortage of trained clinicians, cost of treatment, resources needed to access treatment, stigma, or negative beliefs about CBT and exposure ( Wolitzky -Taylor-2018). Also, VR avatars can provide a supportive learning 
community for self-guided learners who need structure when establishing a new routine such as regular mindfulness practice. An additional benefit of VR is that it is more scalable and disseminable compared with human therapi[INVESTIGATOR_440448] “brick and mortar” treatment 
environments. Given recent technological advances and associated decrease in the cost of VR 
hardware, VR may be readily accessed in a variety of environments. The ability for a user to have treatment continuity in the home environment may facilitate repetition of skill practice, consolidating learning and potentially boosting therapeutic neuroplasticity ( Boeldt-2019).  
In that regard, the premise of this application is that delivering BVR-100 via BehaVR’s platform will provide an efficacious and highly disseminable form of this evidence-based intervention to 
improve outcomes. In addition to overcoming implementation barriers, VR in conjunction with 
BehaVR’s Dynamic Experience Engine (DXE,) can aid in CBT and exposure therapy by [CONTACT_440487], personalizing 
patient experience with machine learning, and encouraging interaction and imagination in an 
immersive virtual environment. Through these features, VR can increase the perceived usability of the intervention ( Garcia- Palacios-2007; Huang -2016) helpi[INVESTIGATOR_440449]-
person and digital treatment environments and increasing treatment engagement (Boeldt-2019; Graham -2019 ). 
Novel evidence- based interventions are needed to improve and increase access to treatment for 
patients with SAD. CBT is an empi[INVESTIGATOR_440450]. However, barriers to treatment ac cessibility may hinder 
widespread implementation of CBT. Combining CBT and VR with the advanced BehaVR DXE 
platform, will increase patient access to an array of potent behavioral and cognitive techniques 
with demonstrated efficacy, while delivering a personally tailored intervention that adapts to the current needs of the patient.

 11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
All study assessments will be conducted/performed remotely. A study schematic is presented in 
Table 5. A S chedule of A ssessments to be performed each w eek is presented in Table 2. 
11.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics will be recorded, including: year  of birth  and age , sex assigned at  birth, ethnic 
identity, and racial identity. 
11.2. Medical and Psychiatric History  
Medical and psychiatric history will also be recorded. Psychiatric history will be reviewed, and 
diagnoses will be confirmed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_440453]. Prior experience with CBT (ie, including 
questions about experiences with in- imagination or in -vivo exposure to fearful situations) and 
use of concomitant medications and substance use will be reviewed. Only relevant/significant medical history and recurrence of any condition will be collected.  
The MINI ( Sheehan -1998) is a short diagnostic structured interview to explore [ADDRESS_558601] meet the MINI criteria 
for Social Anxiety Disorder for study inclusion. 
11.3. Effectiveness Assessments  
All assessments will be administered as outlined in Table 2, Schedule of Assessments.  
Descriptions of each assessment are outlined below. 
11.3.1. Credibility/Expectation Questionnaire  
The Credibility/Expectation Questionnaire ( CEQ ), (Devilly -2000) asks  about the improvements 
that subjects believe will be achieved as a result of treatment, and how believable, convincing, 
and logical the treatment seems. It contains six items rated on a 1 –9 or a 0%-100% scale. The 
first three items of the scale load onto the credibility factor and the final three items load onto the expectancy factor.  
11.3.2.  Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale  
The LSAS (Liebowitz -1987) is a clinician administered  instrument that assesses both fear and 
avoidance across a number of social situations. This measure has been frequently used in pharmacological studies of social phobia and in cognitive behavioral studies. 
The scale consists of 24 items each depi[INVESTIGATOR_440454]. The fear scale ratings 
range from 0 (no fear) to 3 (severe fear). The avoidance ratings also range from 0 to 3 and are 
based on the percent of time avoiding the particular situation [0 = never; 1 = occasionally (10%); 
2 = often (33–67%); and 3 = usually (67–100%)]. The clinician has the flexibility to ask additional questions beyond these ratings and may adjust the ratings accordingly. In addition to 
the fear and avoidance subscales, the LSAS is further divided into two subscales for scoring, 
including social interaction (11 items) and performance situations (13 items). Thus, an overall score is derived al ong with six additional scores based on fear and avoidance: total fear, fear of 
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.[ADDRESS_558602] will be rated using the CGI- S (Guy-1976). The CGI- S is a 
standardized, clinician -administered global rating scale that measures disease severity on a 
7-point Likert scale. A higher score on the CGI-S represents a higher severity of disease. To 
perform this assessment, the rater or investigator will answer the following question: “Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the 
patient at this time?” Response choices include: 1  = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline mentally 
ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4  = moderately ill; 5  = markedly ill; 6  = severely ill; and 7  = among the most 
extremely ill patients.  
11.3.4. Clinical Global Impression - Improvement  
The efficacy of trial treatment will be rated for each subject using the CGI -I (Guy -1976) . The 
rater or investigator will rate the subject’s total change compared to the subject’s condition at 
baseline, whether or not it is due entirely to study treatment. Response choices include: 1 = very 
much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4  = no change, 5 = minimally 
worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.  
11.3.5. Patient Health Questionnaire  
The PHQ ( Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626] -1999 ) is a self -administered version of the PRIME- MD diagnostic instrument 
for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 
DSM criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day).  
11.3.6. Patient Global Impression Improvement  
The PGI -I (Guy-1976) will ask subjects to rate their perceived improvement of their condition 
from treatment initiation to present, based on the following seven-point scale: 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much imp roved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no 
change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.  
11.3.7. Qualitative Interview  
At the conclusion of the study (EOS) or early termination (ET ), a member of the unblinded site 
support team will complete a qualitative interview within 48 hours of the final clinical 
assessments outlined above. This interview will explore subjects' experiences, perceptions, and 
acceptability of BVR -[ADDRESS_558603] telephone number to report safety concerns ( eg, AEs).  This telephone number will be the study site’s phone 
number and also documented on the informed consent form ( ICF). 
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.[ADDRESS_558604]. Subjects should be queried in a non-leadi ng 
manner, without specific prompting ( eg, “Has there been any change in your health status since 
your last visit?”). See Section  12, Safety Reporting. 
All AEs will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_440492] t he 
investigator site staff soliciting AEs at each scheduled telephone contact.  
11.4.2. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) will be administered by [CONTACT_440493]. 
The C -SSRS is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal adverse events 
(suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) throughout the trial. The strength of this suicide 
classification system is in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over-identification of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to 
administer ( Posner-2011). The C- SSRS will be administered by a trained rater at the site. 
Subjects w ith Type 4 or Type 5 suicidal ideation at the Screening or Baseline visit will be 
excluded from entry into the study. Subjects with Type 4 or Type 5 suicidal ideation during the study will be discontinued from the study and referred to a mental health professional. At the 
Screening visit /Visit 1 , the “Baseline/Screening” version of C -SSRS will be used. For all 
applicable visits onward, the “Since Last Visit” version of the C-SSRS will be used. 
If a subject answers “yes” to “Suicidal Ideation” Item  4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent 
to act, without specific plan) or Item 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) on 
any post- Baseline C -SSRS assessment, the subject must be discontinued from the study, referred 
to the Investigator for follow-up evaluation, and followed until the event resolves; in addition, an associated AE must be reported. 
11.5. Study Visits and Assessments  
This study is a decentralized trial, and thus all ‘visits’ will occur via telehealth.  All assessments 
will be c omple

 12. SAFETY REPORTING 
12.1. Definitions  
12.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
investigational intervention in humans, whether or not considered related to the intervention. 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur after the time of signing the Informed Consent Form 
(ICF) and prior to the first VR session  are a subset of AEs referred to in analysis as pre -treatment 
events. Those that occur after first VR session  are considered AEs.  Importantly, all AEs, 
including pre- treatment events, are collected via the same form by [CONTACT_317630], who 
will complete the AE form in the EDC, which will then immediately notify both the CRO and Sponsor. 
An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration of an investigational intervention, whether or not considered related to the investigational intervention. AEs may 
include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. AEs will be 
collected from after first use of the investigational intervention to the EOS/ET.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE 
and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that meets one or more of the follow ing criteria:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life -threatening. 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require a 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
The term "severe" is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction) (see Section  12.2); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as "serious," which is based on subject/event outc ome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning as defined by [CONTACT_29967]. 
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.[ADDRESS_558613] has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (eg, elective surgery) that was 
scheduled before the study entry, ie, before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29919] a therapeutic intervention and not the result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be reported 
as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
SAE criteria information will be captured on the CRF. 
12.1.3. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is  any serious adverse effect on health or safety, 
any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
application; o r any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
12.2. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
All pre -treatment events and AEs including UADEs must be recorded in the subject’s study 
records/source documents in accordance with the Investigator’s normal clinical practice. All pre -
treatment events and AEs must be recorded on the CRF. 
All AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of the condition, the event is otherwise 
explained, the completion of the study, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, frequency, seriousness, action taken with the investigational intervention, outcome, and causal relationship to the investigational intervention. 
Definitions for severity, frequency, action taken with the investigational intervention, outcome, 
and causal relationship to the investigational intervention are presented below. 
The severity of AE: 
• Mild  - Ordinarily transient symptoms that d o not influence performance of subject’s 
daily activities. Other treatment is not ordinarily indicated.  
• Moderate - Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Moderate influence on performance of subject’s daily activities. Other treatment may 
be necessary.  
• Severe - Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’s daily activities. May be unable to continue the study, and other treatment may be necessary.  
The frequency of AE:  
• Once – an isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
• Intermittent  – occurs on two or more separate occasions.  
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.00 BVR -100 
Confidential and Proprietary 49 21 June 2023 
 • Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution. 
The action taken with the investigational intervention: 
• None  
• Removed temporarily  
• Removed permanently  
• Replaced  
• Action tak en with component(s)  
• Unknown  
The outcome of the AE: 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
• Fatal 
• Unknown  
The causal relationship of the AE to the investigational intervention:  
• Not related:  - Improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to other 
drugs/products or underlying disease.  
• Related  
o Possible  - occurred in a reasonable time after the use of the intervention, but 
could be related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease. 
o Probab le - occurred in a reasonable time after use, is unlikely to be attributable to 
concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there is a plausible mechanism to 
implicate the intervention.  
o Definite  - occurred in a reasonable time after use and cannot be expla ined by 
[CONTACT_29969]. The adverse event should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not mandatory before assigning a definite causality.  
The Medical Monitor is the initial contact [CONTACT_376892]. The contact [CONTACT_440499] [ADDRESS_558614] be immediately reported to  the Sponsor by [CONTACT_440500]:

12.3.1. Serious Adverse Events  
When a SAE has occurred, the site will enter the SAE into the EDC witho ut delay after 
awareness, and the Sponsor/designee will receive an email notification  of the SAE. 
The site will complete the SAE  form and file it in the subject’s study records. 
Upon notification, the CRA will reach out to the site staff to collect additio nal information 
related to the event.  
The site will report the SAE to the IRB per their Safety Reporting Requirements and provide the 
submission form and Acknowledgement of Receipt to the CRA. 
The site will follow up on the SAE during each subject contact [CONTACT_440501], lost to follow-up, 
stabilization of condition, study completion, or the event is otherwise explained. Any updates to the SAE will be entered into the EDC. 
The Sponsor or designee will promptly notify all study centers and Investig ators of a n SAE that 
is determined to be a risk for other/all subjects . 
12.3.2. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
The investigator or study staff must determine if an incident, experience, outcome, or adverse 
event that meets all the criteria for a UADE require s prompt reporting to the Sponsor and the 
IRB. The assessment of whether an incident, experience, outcome, or adverse event is 
unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) should consider the following: the 
research procedures that are described  in the protocol-related documents, such as the informed 
consent document, IRB approved research protocol, and t he characteristics of the subject 
population being studied. 
In assessing whether an incident, experience, outcome, or adverse event is related to the 
intervention, the investigator should consider the intervention being administered, and the 
underlying disorder or condition of the subject , and other circumstances unrelated to either the 
intervention or any underlying disorder. 
UADEs and adverse ev ents that are determined to be at least partially caused by [CONTACT_440502], whereas adverse events determined to be 
solely caused by a subject’s underlying disorder or other circumstances unrelated to the trial are 
considered unrelated to participation in the study. 
The i nvestigator is r equired to submit a report of a UADE to the Sponsor and the reviewing IRB 
as soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_558615] 
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.00 BVR -100

investigators within [ADDRESS_558616] FROM STUDY  
Subjects may be prem aturely terminated from the study participation at any time for any of the 
following reasons: 
• Adverse Event (including UADE ) 
• Lost to follow-up (specify) 
• Withdrawal of consent (specify) 
• Death  
• Protocol deviation (specify) 
• Other (specify)  
The reason for termination of study participation and information on the epoch will be recorded 
on the appropriate CRF. In case of death, the date of death should be captured on the CRF. 
Subjects who discontinue early may be replaced at Sponsor discretion to assure that sufficient 
data for evaluation is collected.

 14. STUDY TERMINATION  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at this study center for safety or 
administrative reasons at any time while safeguarding that early termination does not 
compromise subje cts’ safety or well -being. Should the study be terminated and/or the study 
center closed for whatever reason, all documentation and study materials pertaining to the study must be returned to the Sponsor or its representative. 
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], clinical observations suggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate part or the entire study after consultation with the Sponsor. 
In the event of study or site termination, subjects will be required to complete study asses sments 
scheduled for the EOS /Early Termination (Week 8; see Table 2).  
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.[ADDRESS_558617] deviations to power a future trial with 90% 
and an expected effect size between 0.3 and 0.7, fifteen people per arm are recommended (Whitehead -2016). In order to account for a possible attrition rate of 25%, twenty people per arm 
(total n  = 40) will be recruited. In order to ensure adequate data for evaluation, early 
discontinued subjects may be replaced at Sponsor discretion. 
15.2. Analysis Populations  
The effectiveness analyses will be based on the modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population, 
which includes all subjects who are randomized, have completed at least one VR session, and 
have a Baseline and at least one post -Baseline effectiveness measurement in CEQ . Additional 
analysis of the Per -Protoco l (PP) population (defined as all subjects who have completed the 8-
week intervention period without any important protocol deviations) is supportive, while the mITT population will be the primary analysis population. The primary effectiveness endpoint 
must achieve significance in the mITT to preserve type I error for the secondary endpoint. 
The safety assessments will use the Safety population, which includes all subjects who are 
randomized and have completed at least one VR session.  
15.3. Data Analysis  
Continuous outcomes will be summarized for the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, [ADDRESS_558618] day of 
Week  1. Single imputation techniques will be employed for all missing data. All data from the 
CRFs, as well as any derived variables, will be presented in data listings. 
SAS® Version  9.[ADDRESS_558619] disposition will be summarized and presented for the number and percentage of subjects, 
who were screened, entered the study, randomized, completed the study, and discontinued early (including reasons for discontinuations). 
15.3.2. Compliance with BVR-[ADDRESS_558620], will also be 
provided.

Confidential and Proprietary 55 21 June 2023 
 15.3.3. Important Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) will be identified and documented based on a review of 
potential IPDs  prior to database lock. The potential IPDs will be identified through programmatic 
checks of study data  , as well as through review of selected data listings. The potential IPDs to 
be reviewed include, but are not limited to, subjects who: 
• Did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Did not properly use BVR-100 or BES -100. 
• Received any disallowed concomitant medication.  
Individual IPDs will be presented in a data listing. The number and percentage of subjects with 
IPDs will be summarized by [CONTACT_440503]. 
15.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
All analyses will be based on mITT population as described in Section  15.[ADDRESS_558621] and the Mann–Whitney test for 
continuous measurements with and without normal distribution, respectively. 
Medical history will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
version 26.[ADDRESS_558622] one condition in each system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  
15.4.1. Concomitant Medications 
All medications will be coded to indication -specific ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) 
classification (ie, ATC level 3) and preferred name [CONTACT_440515] (WHO-DD) Enhanced extended with WHO Drug Global . 
Any medications taken during the course of the study, with a start date on or after the date of the first use of BVR -100/BES -[ADDRESS_558623] use of BVR -100/BES -[ADDRESS_558624] use of BVR -100/BES -100 will be considered prior 
medications. Prior and Concomitant medications will be summarized for the number and 
percentage of subjects using each medication by [CONTACT_440504] e for the safety population. 
15.4.2. Effectiveness Analyses  
No formal hypothesis testing relating to primary, secondary, or exploratory outcomes is planned because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].

Descriptive statistics will be used to estimate group differences in the CEQ at Baseline and at 
Week s 6 and 8. Exploratorily, CEQ scores differences between groups will be computed using 
Student’s t  tests will be analyzed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Descriptive statistics will be used to estimate group differences in retention rates and time -on-
task at W eeks 6 and 8. Associations determined through Student’s t  tests between the primary 
endpoint (CEQ scores) and both baseline variables and clinical outcomes will be analyzed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of Other Effec tiveness Endpoints  
N/A [IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
Likewise, descriptive statistics will be used to assess differences in the mean change from 
baseline in the LSAS, CGI-S and PHQ- 9 at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8; differences in the mean change 
from CGI -S baseline score in the CGI -I and PGI- I at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8; and proportion of 
subjects with a “responder” status at the end of treatment at W eek 8. Between -group differences 
in LSAS and responder status rates will be analyzed using Student’s t  tests and chi -squared tests, 
respectively.  
15.4.3. Safety Analyses 
Safety data including AEs, SAEs and, UADEs will be collected from the start date/time of Investigational Intervention, defined as the engagement with first intervention session, to the EOS/ET, and summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Adverse events, AEs leading to discontinuation, 
serious AEs, and UADEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1601], for each treatment group, the 
number and percentage of subjects with any AEs, and AEs by [CONTACT_6657]. Adverse events will be further summarized by [CONTACT_440505]. 
AEs are defined as untoward medical occurrences that started at the same time of or after the 
first VR session. Untoward medical occurrences that started prior to the first VR session, but after s igning the ICF are pre- treatment events.  
Whenever available, the time information should be accounted for in the derivation of AEs vs. pre-treatment events. In the case where time is not available, untoward medical occurrences that 
started on or after the day of the first VR session  will be considered AEs; those that started 
before the day of the first VR session , but after signing the ICF, will be considered pre- treatment 
events . The identification of AEs versus pre- treatment events will be determined 
programmatically, and not at the site level.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded using MedDRA version 26.[ADDRESS_558625] medical 
occurrences:

•  with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first BVR -100/BES -100 use, 
or 
•  with both a missing start and stop date. 
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_12129] . 
The following AEs will be summarized and presented by [CONTACT_440506]: 
• All AEs (including number of events and subject incidence). 
• AEs by [CONTACT_926] (mild, moderate, severe). 
• AEs by [CONTACT_440507] (related, or not related). 
The following conventions will be followed in summarizing AEs: 
• For subject incidence summaries, each subject will be counted only once within each 
SOC and within each preferred term.  
• If a subject reports more than one AE within a preferred term and/or a body system, 
the AE with the highest known severity within each body system and w ithin each 
preferred term will be included in the summaries by [CONTACT_926]. 
• For summaries by [CONTACT_440507], AEs will be grouped as “related” or “not related.” AEs assessed as “possible,” “probable,” or 
“definite,” will be gr ouped as “related.” If a subject reports more than one AE within, 
SOC and PT, and any are related, it will be summarized as related. AEs whose 
relationship to the investigational intervention is assessed as “not related” or “unlikely” will be grouped as “not related.”  
A listing of AEs, as well as a listing of deaths, SAEs, UADEs, or AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Suicidality Measure  
Frequency and severity of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior as measured by [CONTACT_941] C- SSRS 
scale will be summarized by [CONTACT_440508]-Baseline period and by [CONTACT_765]. 
15.4.4. Treatment of Missing Data  
Missing observations will be treated as missing at random, and no data imputation will be performed.

ASSURANCE  
16.1. Protected Health and Information and Confidentiality  
The investigator and members of the Investigational Review Board ( IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee ( IEC) of record shall consider all data o r findings generated during the conduct of the 
study, other than information to be disclosed by [CONTACT_2371], as confidential. Disclosure of such data or 
findings to any third party shall not occur without the prior written consent of the Sponsor. 
All reports and communications relating to subjects in the study will identify subjects by [CONTACT_440509]. 
16.2. Data Management  
Every effort will be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data including the selection of qualified investigators as appropriate study centers, review of protocol procedures with the investigators and associated personnel before the study commences, and periodic remote 
monitoring visits by [CONTACT_342796], as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Guidance for eC RF completion will be provided and reviewed with the investigator site  
personnel prior to the start of the study. The Sponsor or designee will review eCRFs for accuracy 
and completeness and any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or designee, as appropriate. 
16.3. Electronic Case Report Forms  
Investigator Site staff, as indicated in the Delegation Log, who will use the EDC system will 
have adequate training in order to perform assigned tasks. Training will be conducted by [CONTACT_1034]’s qualified designated appointee as part of the Site Initiation Visit or as needed.  
Data (such as Medical History, ICF, concomitant medication, assessment of I/E Criteria, and 
safety events  and C- SSRS) collected during the conduct of the study will be entered into a [ADDRESS_558626] clinical scales (LSAS, CGI -I, CGI -S) and PROs (CEQ, PGI -I, PHQ -9) will be administered 
electronically.  
The Diagnostic scale MINI will be done on paper.  
Once the study is closed and all data has been monitored and signed by [CONTACT_2792], the 
database will be locked and analyzed for statistical evaluation and reporting.  
16.4. Study Monitoring  
The study will be monitored from Initiation through study closure by [CONTACT_226422].  
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.[ADDRESS_558627]’s medical records to ensure validity of the data. 
On the occasion that a monitor requests additional data or clarification of data for the eCRF, the 
request must be addressed appropriately prior to the next monitoring visit. Once completed eCRF 
data are verified against source data, the study monitor will electronically sign off to indicate that 
data has been monitored for correctness. The investigator must sign all eCRFs prior to site close out. 
There will be a remote site close out visit to ensure all documentation is in place and all 
outstanding items have been addressed. Record retention policies will be reviewed, and post-study investigator responsibilities discussed. 
16.5. Audits  
The stu dy may be subject to audit by [CONTACT_1034]/designee or any regulatory body. If such an 
audit occurs, the Investigator must agree to allow access to all study related documentation for inspection. Investigators will immediately notify the Sponsor upon learning of announced audits or inspections by [CONTACT_17513]. 
The Investigator will promptly notify the Sponsor/CRO of all requests to inspect a Sunovion-
sponsored study by [CONTACT_29993] a copy of all such inspection reports . 
16.6. Study Documentation  
A source document is defined as any handwritten or computer- generated document that contains 
medical information or test results that have been collected for or are in support of the protocol specifications.  
Investigators are required to record and maintain adequate and accurate case histories for all subject observations, assessments and data pertinent to the study conduct. 
The investigator and Institution will be responsible for providing direct access to source data to 
Sponsor, their designated representatives and to appropriate authorities for the purposes of 
monitoring, audit, IRB/IEC review or regulatory inspection. Subjects will be notified of such access to study records as part of the consenting process. 
16.7. Record Retention and Storage  
Sponsor will retain all study documentation for a period of at least five (5) years or in accordance with Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) regulations in force in the Sponsor’s jurisdiction, whichever 
is greater, following formal discontinuation of the study. 
The investigator shall retain all study documentation for a period of at least three (3) years or in 
accordance with retention policies of the IRB/IEC of record, whichever is longer. 
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.[ADDRESS_558628] of the study including those 
study-related duties delegated to other appropriately qualified individuals. The Investigator will 
assure that study staff cooperate with monitoring and audits. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study is performed in accordance with the 
protocol, current International Council for Harmonization ( ICH) guidelines on GCP, 
International Organization for Standardization ( ISO)[ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_558629] sign and return to Sponsor/CRO the “Investigator Approval" page. 
The Investigator must provide a copy of current curriculum vitae (including a copy of a current 
medical license), ICH -GCP Certificate and financial disclosure information.  
The Investigator must sign and return a completed Investigator Agreement to Sponsor/CRO. 
17.2. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
Before the start of data collection,  the participating physician (or S ponsor where required) will 
provide the IEC/IRB with current and complete copi[INVESTIGATOR_23747] (as required 
by [CONTACT_427]):  
• Final protocol and, if applicable, protocol amendments 
• Sponsor-approved ICF (and any other written materials to be provided to the Subjects)  
• Participating physicians’ curriculum vitae or equivalent information (unless not required, as  documented by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB) 
• Information regarding the name [CONTACT_17008] S ponsor, institutional affiliatio ns, and potential 
conflicts of interest  
• Any other documents that the IEC/IRB requests to fulfill its obligations. 
Where appropriate, as required by [CONTACT_427], this study will be undertaken only after the IEC/IRB has given full approval of the final protocol, protocol amendments (if any, excluding those that are purely administrative, with no consequences for data collection), and the ICF, and 
the Sponsor has received a copy of this approval. This approval letter must be dated and must 
clearly identi fy the IEC/IRB and the documents being approved. 
During the study the participating physician (or Sponsor where required) will send the following documents and updates to the IEC/IRB for their review and approval, where appropriate:  
Clinical Protocol BVR100 -102, Version 1.00 BVR -100 
Confidential and Proprietary 61 21 June 2023 
 • Protocol amendments (excluding those that are purely administrative, with no 
consequences for data collection)  
• Revision(s) to the ICF and any other written materials to be provided to s ubjects  
• If applicable, new or revised Subject recruiting materials approved by [CONTACT_1034] 
• Summaries of the status of the study at intervals stipulated in guidelines of the IEC/IRB

• Any other requirements of the IEC/IRB. 
All protocol amendments and any applicable revisions to the ICF will follow the appropriate review and approval process, in accordance with local regulations.  
At the end of the study, where required by [CONTACT_427], the participating physician or 
authorized designee (or Sponsor where required) will notify the IEC/IRB about the study completion. 
17.3. Informed Consent  
Each subject must sign an ICF allowing data collection and source data verification in accordance with local requirements and Sponsor policy. The ICF must be signed before collection of any subject data.  
The ICF that is/are used must be reviewed and approved in accordance with local regulations, 
applicable regulatory requirements, and Sponsor policy, and must be in a language that the subject can read and understand.  
Prior to participation , each prospective subject will be given a full explanation of the study, 
allowed to read the approved informed consent form and be provided ample time and the 
opportunity to ask any questions that may arise. Once all questions have been answered and the 
Investigator is assured that the prospective subject understands the implications of participating 
in the study, the prospective subject will be  asked to give consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_1725]. As part of the consent process, each prospective subject must 
consent to direct access to his/her medical records for study-related monitoring, auditing, 
IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection. It should be clearly explained to each prospective subject that participation in each and every study contact [CONTACT_440510]. The 
Investigator will provide a copy of the signed informed consent form to each subject, and will 
record the date of the informed consent on the CRF. 
If an amendment to the protocol changes the subject participation schedule in scope or activity, 
or if important new infor mation becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent,

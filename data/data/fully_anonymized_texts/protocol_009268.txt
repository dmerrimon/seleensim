TITLE  Examination of the Effectiveness and Implementation of Asthma Link™: A Real World Application of Supervised Asthma Therapy   2. EXTERNAL IRB REVIEW HISTORY* N/A  3. PRIOR APPROVALS: N/A  4. OBJECTIVES* The objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_838941]-based practice of school-supervised asthma therapy in a real-world setting. If Asthma Link is found to be an acceptable practice with appropriate adoption and sustainability, it can serve as a scalable public health model for improving asthma medication adherence and combating the significant morbidity associated with pediatric asthma in the real world, rather than just research settings.  Aim 1: We will analyze process outcomes (acceptability, adoption, costs, sustainability) of Asthma Link™ in two pediatric practices.  Aim 2: Evaluate feasibility of a cluster RCT of Asthma Link™. The primary trial outcomes will be participant recruitment, retention, and intervention fidelity. The secondary trial outcomes will be differences in the frequency of asthma symptoms, emergency department visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], courses of oral corticosteroids, spi[INVESTIGATOR_838942].  As each stage of Asthma Link™ evaluation builds upon the previous stage, we will submit separate IRB amendments and proposals for each stage of this project. The data collected from the proposed study will inform a large-scale cluster RCT to test the effectiveness and implementation of Asthma Link™.  5. BACKGROUND* Countless pediatric asthma interventions have been successful in improving asthma outcomes in research settings, yet few are adopted into clinical practice to produce noticeable public health impact. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_838943], childhood asthma still affects 12-15% of children in the urban [LOCATION_002], causes over [ADDRESS_1165791] of childhood asthma morbidity is attributable to non-adherence to a daily preventive medication, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).4-[ADDRESS_1165792] urged that providers and researchers develop more effective adherence programs.11,12   
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN   
Docket# H00016378  Page 3 of 24 Template Revised 8/8/2017/Document Version 7,Updated 10.27.[ADDRESS_1165793] shown that school-supervised asthma therapy not only improves medication adherence in children with asthma but also that this practice is safe, with no adverse effects seen.13-15 School-supervised asthma therapy has been established as safe and efficacious, and therefore asthma experts (including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology, and the National Association of School Nurses) endorse school-supervised asthma therapy as the evidenced-based standard of care.[ADDRESS_1165794], low-intensity community-clinical based model of supervised asthma therapy in schools. Asthma Link is an established, ongoing clinical program that promotes the adoption of the evidenced-based practice of school-supervised asthma therapy in real world settings.   Asthma Link connects the three groups that play vital roles in the health of school-aged children with asthma: pediatric practices, school nurses, and families. Pediatricians identify and enroll children with poorly controlled asthma and medication non-adherence as part of their routine practice. They send the school nurse an order for daily, supervised inhaled steroid administration at school. Families bring the prescribed inhaler to school. The school nurse supervises the child’s inhaler administration and provides adherence education, as part of her daily routine, to ensure adherence and proper inhaler/spacer technique. Ongoing communication occurs between the pediatric practice, the school nurse and families throughout the school year. Asthma Link is based on prior research studies that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of school-supervised asthma therapy. The goal of Asthma Link is for school-supervised asthma therapy to operate in a real-world setting, delivered by [CONTACT_153997], school nurses and families within their current routines and relying on minimal resources and no research staff.   The goal of the proposed study is to examine the effectiveness and implementation of Asthma LinkTM in sustainable real-world practice.   Preliminary Data: The current proposed study builds from our prior research, which has informed the proposed study. To initially test Asthma LinkTM, we performed a small pre/post study (SEE IRB DOCKET # H00010546_2) of 84 children enrolled in Asthma LinkTM (mean age 10 years, 95% Medicaid insurance, 67% Latino, 19% Black). We observed that children enrolled in Asthma LinkTM experienced a 54% decline in emergency room visits, a 95% decline in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144] a 46% decline in rescue medication use over a one-year follow-up period (p<0.001),17 demonstrating that Asthma LinkTM merits further rigorous evaluation. Additionally, in order to examine the barriers and facilitators to Asthma LinkTM real-world implementation, (SEE IRB DOCKET # H00012920_1), we are interviewing program stakeholders which include school 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN   
Docket# H00016378  Page 4 of 24 Template Revised 8/8/2017/Document Version 7,Updated 10.27.21 nurses, parent-child dyads, and medical providers who were participating in the program in addition to public health and insurance officials. Specifically, in our interviews with 12 school nurses, we found that they perceive Asthma LinkTM to be an acceptable program given the brief (<5min) time required and ease of incorporation into their existing routine.   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_838944], Asthma LinkTM needs to be tested against a comparison group, using a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). The first step is to perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_838945] (Aim 2). Additionally, it is imperative to assess process outcomes (acceptability, adoption, costs, sustainability) of Asthma LinkTM in new pediatric practices to ensure that school-supervised asthma therapy can be successfully scaled up and utilized in real world practice (Aim 1). We propose to test Asthma LinkTM using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_838946] 4 pediatric primary care sites in [LOCATION_005].  6.

PROCEDURES INVOLVED* Randomization. Two groups of two practices (4 practices in total) will be matched based on comparable size and percent of minority patients. Within each pair, practices will be randomly allocated to Asthma Link or the comparison condition, using a computerized function. This will result in two practices randomized to the Asthma Link condition and two practices randomized to the Enhanced Usual Care comparison condition.   Recruitment will be performed from each practice site until the target n=72 parent-child dyads (18 per site) are recruited. (see section 13 on “Sample size calculation”) Recruitment will begin during the 2021-2022 academic school year.   Procedure Steps: 1. Research coordinator (RC) identifies potentially eligible patients (children aged 6-17 years (enrolled in grade 1-12) years and prescribed a daily inhaled corticosteroid per medical record from most recent visit scheduled for a clinic visit) through the practice’s office scheduling and medical record system (e.g., Epic). RC will also collect that patient’s name, DOB, mailing and email addresses, phone number, insurance type (as a proxy for socioeconomic status), list of 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN   
Docket# H00016378  Page 7 of 24 Template Revised 8/8/2017/Document Version 7,Updated 10.27.21 medications, number of emergency room visits, number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838953].  2. RC creates a Lilac Form for any potentially eligible patients as described above. (Lilac form is an indicator to the medical provider seeing the patient that this patient is potentially eligible for study.) 3. Asthma Link condition: As part of clinical practice, medical provider will determine if patient is struggling with taking daily asthma medicine. If YES, then will introduce Asthma Link by [CONTACT_3041] “There is a clinical program that allows for your child to receive their daily asthma medicine at school supervised by [CONTACT_7091].” Child can be enrolled in Asthma Link per the usual clinical steps (see Asthma Link steps).  • After they are enrolled in Asthma Link, medical provider will give family one-page description of study (see Flyer) and state “Researchers at UMass are performing a study of children who are participating in Asthma Link, would you be interested in hearing more?”  3a. Enhanced Usual Care comparison condition: Medical provider will determine if patient is struggling with taking daily asthma medicine, if YES, the provider will give family a one-page description of study (see Flyer) and state “Researchers at UMass are performing a study of children with asthma to learn about how to support them in taking their every day asthma medicine, would you be interested in hearing more?” • Attached to the “Flyer” will be the Authorization to Contact [CONTACT_982]. (see Authorization to Contact [CONTACT_982])  • If the parent agrees, the Lilac form with the family’s information is faxed to the Research Coordinator.  The pediatric office will fax this form with a confidential cover form.   • The fact sheet will be mailed to the parent with a letter saying that the Research Coordinator will call or text them (see Fact Sheet).  • The Research Coordinator will only call the parent five times. The first and third time a message will not be left, but a text message will be sent stating “This is X from Asthma Link, can I call you at TIME?” The second, fourth, and fifth time a message will be left saying “This is X from the University of [LOCATION_005] Medical School. I am calling about the material on Asthma Link I sent you. Please call me back at X.”  • A phone screen will be conducted to ensure study inclusion criteria (see phone script). • The Research Coordinator will obtain informed consent from eligible participants, including parental permission for their child to participate, child assent to participate, and parental consent to participate. (see sections 30, 31 on Consent) • After all questions are answered regarding the study by [CONTACT_7071], the Research Coordinator will send the baseline survey via email to the participant to be completed by [CONTACT_838979].  • The Research Coordinator will then access the child’s medical record and obtain the discharge summaries, the emergency service records, the office/clinic notes, the problem list, the pulmonary studies, the child’s list of medications, and the child’s height and weight (to help interpret the spi[INVESTIGATOR_44049]). • The Research Coordinator will then call the child’s pharmacy to obtain refill history for their daily ICS inhaler.

We do not anticipate issues with this recruitment based on prior recruitment of families for Asthma LinkTM from the Worcester community in our pre/post study and based on prior recruitment from these same pediatric practices in the FITLINE study. (also see page 19 which describes estimated number of asthmatics in proposed Pediatric practices, demonstrating feasibility of recruitment). The Institutional Review Board will review all research procedures and protocols. All instruments will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval prior to use.   We will not enroll any participants in the study prior to receiving IRB approval.   SURVEY – PARENT AND CHILD – 20 MINUTES _See uploaded parent baseline, parent 3 month, parent 6 month, and parent 12 month surveys. The 4 parent surveys will include the following constructs: Patient Health Outcome questions including the Asthma Control Test (ACT; measure of severity of asthma symptoms) and the Maximum Asthma Symptom Days (MSD), Emergency Department visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], school absences, oral steroid usage and pharmacy refill data. The Baseline survey will include demographic questions that ask about the parent’s age, sex, race/ethnicity, relation to the child participating in the study, education, marital status, tobacco usage, health insurance, contact [CONTACT_3031], family functioning, comorbidities, income, and average monthly as a proxy for socioeconomic status. The 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month follow up surveys for the Asthma LinkTM condition will also include the following constructs: acceptability, cost, and sustainability. All surveys will be completed either on-line using RedCap (Please see data management) or over the phone with the Research Coordinator. We are using emails and/or phone calls to deliver/collect these surveys. As soon as the baseline survey has been completed, those completing the survey via email will be automatically sent out future surveys.

This data will also be collected [ADDRESS_1165798] on health outcomes and to see if engagement in Asthma Link continues beyond one year.  This data will be directly put into the RedCap database without any downloading of information. (please see data management section)    We will be contact[CONTACT_838980]’s pharmacy to obtain refill history of their daily ICS medication at baseline (obtaining the number of refills for the prior 6 months), 3, 6, and 12 months, and 12 months following the completion of the 12 month survey to assess for medication adherence.  This data will be entered directly into the REDCap database.    Portable Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]: At baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months the child will perform spi[INVESTIGATOR_838954]’s office.

The Research Coordinator will enter the spi[INVESTIGATOR_838957].   School absence data will be collected through school nurse report and will be recorded from the school nurse on the School Nurse checklist and faxed to the Research Coordinator.  Asthma Link Condition: Those practices that are randomized to the Asthma Link group will receive pediatric pulmonologist delivered trainings for pediatric practices on behavioral strategies to help promote asthma medication adherence and a 1 hour training on the Asthma Link clinical program and how to enroll children in Asthma Link (reviewing the steps of this clinical program- see “Asthma Link Clinical Program Steps”) and carry out this evidenced- based program in the context of their clinical practice (reviewing the steps to Asthma Link and answering any questions they may have).  Comparison Condition: Those practices that are randomized to the Enhanced Usual Care Comparison Group will receive pediatric pulmonologist delivered trainings for pediatric practices on behavioral strategies to help promote asthma medication adherence. These include training to counsel patients on the strategies such as the placement of cell phone alarms to remember to take their daily medicine and placement of an elastic band around the inhaler and the toothbrush so that a child always remembers to take their daily inhaler before brushing their teeth. We thought it ethically important to provide more than just usual care to the 2 pediatric practices assigned to the comparison condition.  Families who agree to participate in the study from either the Asthma Link or Enhanced Usual Care practices will receive a mailed “Asthma Workbook” to aid in their understanding of asthma, support their asthma care and help with daily medicine adherence (See Asthma Workbook)

Data Analysis and Management*  Sample size calculation  In order to obtain a sample size of [ADDRESS_1165799] sizes for between-condition comparisons, due to the imprecision inherent in data from small samples 19,20 we base our proposed sample size of 72 parent-child dyads (36 per condition, 18 per practice) on pragmatics of recruitment, retention and the necessities for examining feasibility, providing important information for design and recruitment for the future R01 study to test the impact of Asthma LinkTM in a large cluster RCT.  We will identify refinements required to implement the large cluster RCT by [CONTACT_838981], retention, engagement, fidelity and assessment procedures of Asthma LinkTM.   Taking estimation of retention rate as an illustrative outcome, and applying an intra-class (pediatric practice) correlation of 0.01, similar to the value of 0.[ADDRESS_1165800]. Pbert’s prior studies of school-based teen smoking, the resulting design effect=1.19 = 1 + [1  + 0.01 × 9]21 yields an effective sample size of 20/1.09 ≈18 dyads/condition.  For a conservatively low retention rate of 80%, lower than the 97% observed in [CONTACT_838999]’s previous FITLINE study,18 we can estimate a 95% confidence interval for retention percent of (51.9%, 95.7%) for each practice separately or (68.9%, 88.5%) combining all 4 practices. A sample of 18 dyads per practice (36 per condition) yields 95% confidence intervals for practice ICC of (0.018, 0.094) for a conservatively large true ICC=0.05.[ADDRESS_1165801] errors,19,20 we will combine our results (including the ICC) with clinically meaningful effect and results of previous adequately powered interventions to calculate sample size requirements for our large cluster RCT. Data from the recruited pediatric practices show that 5-7 very poorly controlled asthmatics are seen per month.   Statistical Analysis:  To assess feasibility outcomes in Aim 1, we will estimate parameters relevant for planning a larger study, including standard deviations of outcomes and ICC. We will also conduct preliminary analyses of the impact of Asthma LinkTM on asthma outcomes. We will compare participants in the two arms (Asthma LinkTM and comparison group), using methods such as parametric or nonparametric t-test or Poisson regression, depending on the observed outcome distribution. Some outcomes may have a Poisson distribution, such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], while spi[INVESTIGATOR_838958]. Intent-to-treat and completer analyses will be performed. The data collected in this proposal will provide estimates of trial retention, ICC, standard deviation, and effect size. We will use these and data published in the literature to estimate sample size for a larger trial. The secondary outcomes analyses of asthma health outcomes will be exploratory by [CONTACT_838982][INVESTIGATOR_31093].

Data confidentiality will be emphasized on the surveys and verbally by [CONTACT_25227], and by [CONTACT_2224] a unique study identification number.  Data Management: The surveys will be conducted either over the phone or by [CONTACT_838983]™ system, a nationally used secure, web-based database application (http://project-redcap.org) that provides: 1) an intuitive interface, 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export, 3) procedures for importing data from external sources, 4) easy development of web survey tools and 5) automated export procedures to various statistical packages.  14. PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS*  Potential Risks and Adequacy of Protection Against Risks. The interventions (both Asthma LinkTM and Enhanced Usual Care) in this proposal are state-of-the-art, developed by a Pediatric Pulmonologist and represent good standards of care as recommended by [CONTACT_838984], Allergy, and Immunology. Asthma LinkTM practices are evidenced-based and have not shown any adverse events in multiple prior studies.13,[ADDRESS_1165802] concerns about the confidentiality of their surveys and study records. The Research Coordinator and Primary Investigator will emphasize the confidentiality of all data collected and reassure and address any participant with concerns. Participant confidentiality will be maintained through a number of strategies. Each participant will be assigned a unique study identification (ID) number. Any link between the unique study ID and participant identifiers such as demographics, asthma health data, and questionnaire data will only be accessible to the Primary Investigator and Research Coordinator responsible for data collection and will be maintained in a secure, encrypted, password-protected, HIPAA compliant research drive. Other UMMS personnel will not be privy to identifying information about the individual participants and the link between study ID and identifiers will otherwise be destroyed. Given the minimal risk nature of this study, a data monitoring committee would not be necessary.  All data stored within computer files will be password protected behind a firewall to ensure that access is available only to those directly involved in the study analysis. Only data that has been stripped of all personal identifying information is made available to the data management (e.g. RedCap) systems;   At study completion, the link between the identifying information and their data will be destroyed, as will be contact [CONTACT_3031].

The role of the responsible person is 1) to identify the concern through assessing for health changes at each survey; 2) develop an appropriate response that involves consultation whenever possible to alleviate or minimize any adverse event (AE); and 3) to ensure that the adverse event is reported in a timely manner to the responsible authority. We will collect adverse events that are volunteered spontaneously during interactions with participants. Participants will be monitored for occurrence of events defined as any undesirable experience or unanticipated benefit. Events may occur during recruitment, intervention deployment, and follow-up assessments. Based upon previous research in school-supervised asthma therapy, we anticipate that adverse events or experiences will be rare. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_838960] (adverse event) and will record details of all adverse events on an adverse event case report form.  Although our study poses minimal risk to subjects and no adverse events are expected due to the nature of the study, we will follow the adverse event procedure of the University of [LOCATION_005] Medical School.  The current policy for reporting unanticipated problems and adverse events for the protection of human subjects in research at the University of [LOCATION_005] Medical School is as follows: “All adverse events involving risk to subjects or others that are serious and unanticipated and related to the study procedures must be reported, using the applicable Prompt Reporting Form, within [ADDRESS_1165804] be reported, using the applicable Prompt Reporting Form, within 48 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event.   In certain situations, this requirement for prompt reporting may necessitate the submission of a report before all information has been collected.  In these situations, a preliminary report may be submitted with a follow-up report submitted at a later date when more information is available.      Events/problems which are not serious, are anticipated and not related to the study procedures must be reported in summary format at the time of continuing review.”  Adverse events that do not meet the requirements of prompt reporting will be provided at the time continuing review is submitted. The continuing review form in the UMMS eIRB will request this information.  We do not anticipate that any serious adverse events (death, life threatening illness, new serious or permanent disability) will occur. However, should such an event occur, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_838961] 24 hours of initial receipt of information to the University of [LOCATION_005] IRB and NHLBI program officer. Other serious and unexpected AEs related to the study will be reported to the Program Officer within 5 days. Unanticipated

An estimate of the extent of injury, and prevention strategies will be reported. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_838962]: • Not related: The event is clearly related to factors such as the participant’s clinical state, not with the study protocol. • Remote: The event was most likely related to factors such as the participant’s clinical state, not with the study protocol. • Possible: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence associated with participating in the study and/or is consistent with events related to receiving the intervention but is possibly related to factors such as the subject’s clinical state. • Probable: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence associated with participating in the study and/or is consistent with receiving the intervention and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_274534]’s clinical state. The severity of an adverse event in both groups is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree or intensity of an adverse event as determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_48094]: • Mild: No impact (in anyway) on the participant. • Moderate: Impacts on the participant but is not life-threatening or incapacitating. • Severe: Fatal, life threatening, permanently disabling; severely incapacitating; requires immediate medical evaluation. All adverse events will simultaneously be reported to institutional officials. The report will summarize the facts of the case, including the date and a description of the participant; whether the event is related to the study’s protocols; the steps that have been taken to address the issue; whether the event provides emerging knowledge about the risks of the study that should be conveyed to respondents; and whether the consent form should be revised.  Anticipated Adverse Events. Given that this is a minimal risk study, a data monitoring committee and/or a data safety monitoring board is not required for this study. An adverse events log is inappropriate for this type of study. Alternatively, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_838963]-related unexpected events arise, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_838964]’s prompt reporting requirements. We do not anticipate any adverse events from this study as the primary procedures involve minimal risk surveys, checklists and routine clinical spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  In this research, the risks that result from study participation are considered minimal as the research is primarily evaluative with the use of surveys and performance of spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].

POTENTIAL DIRECT BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS* The potential benefit gained by [CONTACT_838986]-related health risks for those with improved adherence to their preventive medication. In addition, each individual participant is contributing to the evaluation of childhood asthma interventions for school-aged children. Potential benefits to society and the larger community include the implementation of effective evidenced- based asthma interventions for school-aged children and increased capability to deliver intervention programs to children and families. These benefits are substantial in comparison to the minimal risk possible.  18. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS* This research will involve children. The description below explains the importance of including children to perform this research and the safeguards, which will protect their rights and welfare.   Childhood asthma affects 12-15% of children in the urban [LOCATION_002] with considerable morbidity and healthcare costs, despi[INVESTIGATOR_838943]. There exists extremely effective therapy for childhood asthma: inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). However, ICS are grossly underutilized with adherence rates at less than 20%, particularly in low-income, minority patients. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in childhood asthma are grave, with the highest rates of emergency room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838969]. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_838970], which are mitigated by [CONTACT_838987], including daily use of ICS, childhood asthma remains undertreated. Recognizing this gap, the NHLBI Expert Panel on Asthma emphasizes that asthma self-management is essential and there have been three successfully conducted trials of school-supervised ICS therapy in school-aged children.   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_838971], these research-tested interventions have not been adopted in real-world practice. This is due in part to high cost and high intensity approaches that are not feasible in the real world. This study seeks to

If they are, they will be added to an email list (a mailing address will be obtained for anyone who prefers this to an email address). Once the study has been completed, we will send a lay summary of the results to participants who indicated interest  22. SETTING This pi[INVESTIGATOR_838972] 4 Pediatric Primary Care practices in Worcester MA: Benedict Pediatrics, Worcester Pediatrics, Quality Kids and Harding Pediatrics. These particular sites were selected due to their high rates of asthma and matching for relevant demographics. We have worked with these sites in [CONTACT_838999]’s prior FITLINE study. If there are logistical issues with any of these practices after commencement of funding, we have identified 4 alternative practices in Worcester as backups.  23. RESOURCES AVAILABLE This study includes the PI, research coordinator, research assistants, statistician and senior mentor. Collectively the staff has over 40 years of clinical research experience at UMMS.  The roles of each research staff member is listed below: Principal Investigator (PI) (0.75 FTE): This position requires advanced training in Pediatric Pulmonology, research design and methods. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_838973], appropriate training for their respective

This person will oversee all aspects of the study, data acquisition, and data analysis. Research Coordinator (0.6 FTE): This position is a specialized research professional working with and under the direction of the clinical Principal Investigator (PI).  The Research Coordinator supports, facilitate and coordinate the daily clinical trial activities and plays a critical role in the conduct of the study. The responsibilities include:  maintaining records, handling IRB submissions, data management, and performing any other study related procedures that fall within their scope of practice only after receiving the appropriate training required to perform the procedures.   Research Assistants (0.2 FTE): Responsibilities include support of study recruitment, data management, data analysis, and other study related activities deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_978].  Statistician (0.01 FTE): This position requires training in statistics.  The statistician will be responsible for data analysis and performing any other study related procedures that fall within their scope of practice only after receiving the appropriate training required to perform the procedures.  Senior Mentor (0.01 FTE): A Ph.D, Senior level investigator who will dedicate her time in-kind to oversight of this project  All study staff will be supervised by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_838974]/GCP certification. All persons assisting with the research will be trained and monitored by [CONTACT_21114] [INVESTIGATOR_838975].     24. LOCAL RECRUITMENT METHODS Justify the feasibility of recruiting the required number of suitable subjects within the given recruitment period. For example, how many potential subjects do you have access to? What percentage of them do you need to recruit?   Feasibility of Recruitment: Rates of asthma approximately range from 15%-25% among the practices’ patients, with a mean of 18.5%.  Given this rate and number of patients, we are very confident that we will be able to recruit 13 families per practice over the course of the one and a half-year recruitment period.   Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be identified and recruited. If recruiting in a clinical setting, will clinical staff ask potential subjects if it’s ok for study staff to approach? If recruiting by [CONTACT_2319], will letters come from the subject’s clinician or clinic head?   For the sites that are randomized into the intervention arm of the study, a one page flyer for the clinical Asthma LinkTM program will be placed in each of the exam rooms in the clinics and will encourage families to ask their providers about Asthma LinkTM if they have a child who has asthma. The flyer will only advertise the clinical Asthma LinkTM program. Additionally, triage nurses at these sites may remind providers to screen potentially eligible patients for the clinical Asthma LinkTM program when scheduling sick visits related to Asthma or breathing

Research staff will send an email link to access the survey to families who provide verbal consent. The 4 pediatric practices participating in the trial estimate 7,462 children total in their practices between children in grades 1-6; with a conservative estimate of 15% with asthma symptoms, this provides approximately 1,119 children from which to recruit 40 children into the trial, making recruitment highly feasible.   Describe how individuals will be screened for eligibility. Will any identifiers be recorded? If so, when will identifiers be de-linked from the data and when will identifiers be completely destroyed? Be sure to address individuals who enroll and individuals who turn out to be ineligible or who decline to participate.  The fact sheets and the HIPAA authorization form will be mailed to the potential participants with a letter saying that the Research Coordinator will call them. The Research Coordinator will contact [CONTACT_838992]/legal guardian and child’s potential role using a standardized information sheet. The Research Coordinator will answer any questions about the study and obtain verbal consent. Once the parent provides consent, the Research Coordinator will obtain verbal assent from the child. The Research Coordinator will then email the link to sign the HIPAA authorization. Once the HIPAA authorization is signed, the Research Coordinator will then email the link to complete the survey via REDCap. The Research Coordinator will only call the family five times.  The first time a message will not be left.  The second, fourth and fifth time a message will be left saying “This is X from the University of [LOCATION_005] Medical School. I am calling about the material I sent you. Please call me back at X. (please see uploaded flyer and phone script). Enrollment will not begin until IRB has approved these materials. Individuals who decline to be contact[CONTACT_838993].  Describe the amount, method, and timing of any payments to subjects. To compensate participants for their time, and to incentivize participation in the completion of all assessments, we will provide compensation to each parent-child dyad in the form of gift cards to a local retailer (i.e., Target or Wal-Mart). Compensation will be divided through the study period (a $[ADDRESS_1165808] for each parent-child dyad on enrollment and completion of baseline assessment, another $[ADDRESS_1165809] at 3-month assessment, a $[ADDRESS_1165810] at 6-month assessment, and a $[ADDRESS_1165811] at the 12 month assessment). We will also be mailing families with a short hand-written thank you note and ‘prize’ after the 3 month survey (stickers), 6 month survey (small toy prize), at the 9 month time point (magnet or postcard with reminder for 12 mo survey), and after the completion of the 12 month survey (completion certificate). All mailings will be in a sealed envelope to protect confidentiality.  Pediatric practice sites will be provided lunch during their information session for the research study which will be funded by [CONTACT_838994]2TR001454 award and will be considered separate from the subject compensation.  School nurses participating in the study will receive a $[ADDRESS_1165812] and for completing the brief surveys.

We are accessing records before they enter the study and we are requesting a HIPPA waiver in order to identify potential subjects for this. We will obtain HIPAA authorization via electronic signature [CONTACT_838998]. (see HIPAA waiver and HIPAA Authorization). After the family interacts with the medical provider and consents to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], they will provide their name, address, phone number, and email to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].

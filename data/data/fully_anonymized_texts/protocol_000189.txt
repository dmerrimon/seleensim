Study Title An open-label, single-arm, single-dose, prospective, multicenter 
Phase 2b study to establish image interpretation criteria for 
18F-fluciclovine positron emission tomography (PET) in detecting 
recurrent brain metastases after radiation therapy (PURSUE) 
Phase 2b 
Sponsor Blue Earth Diagnostics, Ltd 
Funding Organization Blue Earth Diagnostics, Ltd 
Study Design This is a prospective, open-label, single-arm, single-dose study in 
patients with solid tumor brain metastases previously treated with 
radiation therapy, designed to define image interpretation criteria 
for 18F-fluciclovine PET in detecting recurrent brain metastases. 
Study Rationale Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumor in 
adults, occurring in up to 40% of patients with cancer ( Suh, 2010; 
Sinha, 2017), with approximately 200,000 patients affected each 
year in the [LOCATION_003] ( Arvold, 2016 ). Following localized treatment of 
brain metastases (increasingly, stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] 
alongside neurosurgical resection [ Kann, 2017; NCCN, 2019]), 
close follow-up with serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 
the brain is performed to evaluate for recurrent disease. 
Conventional MRI is currently recommended as the main imaging 
test ( NCCN, 2019) following localized treatment, as it is widely 
available and offers high spatial resolution, with presence of 
recurrent disease suggested by [CONTACT_511895] 
(CE) depi[INVESTIGATOR_511887]/structural information. However, 
conventional MRI (CE-T1 and fluid attenuated inversion recovery 
[FLAIR]/T 2-weighted sequences) has limited specificity due to 
the incidence of treatment-related changes, including radiation 
necrosis ( Galldiks, 2019 ). These treatment-related changes have 
similar appearance to true recurrence of disease on conventional 
MRI, including CE, origin near the primary tumor site, vasogenic 
edema, growth over time, and mass effect ( Langen, 2017; Langen, 
2018; Pope, 2018).  
No specific feature or combination of features on conventional 
MRI has been established to differentiate between disease 
recurrence and treatment-related changes including radiation 
necrosis and pseudoprogression ( Verma, 2013 ). Specificity of 
conventional MRI to diagnose recurrent tumor after SRS using 
visual reads has been reported to be as low as 19% ( Peng, 2018), 
with attempts at validating permutations of 
neuroradiologist-defined measurements reporting specificities of 
32% to 41% ( Dequesada, 2008 ; Stockham, 2012). Alongside the 
estimated 25% incidence rate of radiation necrosis ( Vellayappan, 
2018), rates of true local recurrence of disease are similar, ranging 
from 27% to 31% ( Kocher, 2011; Brown, 2010). Therefore, the true prevalence of recurrent disease post -radiotherapy where

treatment-related change ( Patel, 2018).   
18F-fluciclovine has been demonstrated to be transported by 
[CONTACT_511896]-serine-cysteine-transporter 2 
(ASCT2) and L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), which are 
high-affinity glutamine and leucine transporters, respectively 
(Schuster, 2014). Given the known increased expression of 
ASCT2 and LAT1 in many tumor types (including the [ADDRESS_662078] 
common sources of brain metastases: lung, breast and skin 
cancer) ( Fuchs, 2005 ), and aforementioned early clinical study 
data, it is anticipated that PET imaging with 18F-fluciclovine will 
be useful in detecting recurrent brain metastases.

STATISTICS 
Primary Analysis 
Plan Diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV) 
of different thresholds of lesion 18F-fluciclovine uptake on visual 
reads (as defined by [CONTACT_511900]) versus SoT derived from central histopathological 
analysis of all lesions, at subject-level and lesion-level, will be 
calculated. Subject-level diagnostic performance will be 
calculated based on reference lesion data, while lesion-level 
diagnostic performance will be calculated based on data of all 
sampled lesions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis 
of SoT against the quantitative measures of lesion 18F-fluciclovine 
uptake will be performed. For dynamic measures of lesion 
18F-fluciclovine uptake represented by [CONTACT_511901] (TAC) 
type, diagnostic performance for each TAC category will be 
calculated. The Image Interpretation Committee will review these 
analyses to establish appropriate image interpretation criteria. 
Subsequently, for the diagnostic performance secondary endpoints, sensiti vity, specificity, PPV and NPV for a 
BED-FLC-[ADDRESS_662083]-18F--fluciclovine administration 
based on reported serious and non-serious adverse events (SAEs 
and AEs, respectively). For the evaluation of safety, 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as those 
AEs with onset after the dose of IMP, or existing events that 
worsened after the dose of IMP during the study, through 1 day 
following IMP administration. Adverse event verbatim terms will 
be mapped to preferred terms and system organ classes using the 
current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
Severity of AEs will be graded using the NCI- Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. The 
frequency of TEAEs will be summarized overall, by [CONTACT_59134], and by [CONTACT_511902]. Rationale for Number

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3  1.1. Overview of Clinical Studies 
Two small investigator-initiated trials (IITs) conducted at Emory University have evaluated 
18F-fluciclovine for PET imaging of brain metastases in adults ( Schuster, 2003; Patel, 2018), 
with results suggesting efficacy. Both studies reported increased 18F-fluciclovine uptake in 
brain metastases: one study in 5 patients with 9 lesions and another in 12 patients with 
17 lesions. In the larger study, all patients had prior treatment for brain metastases and had a 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indeterminate for recurrent disease. Using either biopsy 
or clinical follow-up as the standard of truth (SoT), 15/[ADDRESS_662087] also reported the use of 18F-fluciclovine in 
other neuro-oncology settings ( Parent, 2018; Karlberg, 2019 ; Michaud, 2020; Bogsrud, 
2019). This includes one IIT in suspected recurrent primary brain tumor (N=27) 
(Michaud, 2020), where tumor uptake of 18F-fluciclovine provided significantly higher image 
contrast to 11C-Methionine. 18F-fluciclovine, based on a subset of 3 patients with 
indeterminate MRI, was suggested to be potentially useful in this setting. A retrospective 
analysis of 21 patients with suspected residual or recurrent high grade glioma ( Bogsrud, 
2019) reported high 18F-fluciclovine uptake in histopathologically / clinically confirmed 
disease, including the detection of small satellite tumors not previously visualized with MRI 
in [ADDRESS_662088] ( Henderson, 2019 ). Industry 
sponsored studies include 4 studies conducted by [CONTACT_511903]-Physics Co., Ltd (NMP) in 
patients with treatment-naïve glioma: NMK36-BT-P201 (N=5) ( Kondo, 2016), 
MK36-BT-P202 (N=40) ( Wakabayashi, 2017), NMK36-BT-P301 and NMK36-BT-P302. 
These studies collectively suggest the potential for 18F-fluciclovine to delineate extent of 
treatment-naïve primary brain tumor beyond contrast-enhancing regions on MRI. 
As a marketed product, 18F-fluciclovine has been administered to more than 75,000 patients. 
Safety data are available from 1203 patients exposed to 18F-fluciclovine in clinical trials. The 
doses administered range from 51.8 to 485 MBq, with the majority of patients receiving 
approximately 370 MBq for the imaging of prostate cancer, and approximately 180 MBq for 
glioma in Studies NMK36-BT-P201, NMK36-BT-P202, NMK36-BT-P301 and 
NMK36-BT-P302. No deaths and no serious adverse events (SAEs) attributable to 
18F-fluciclovine injection have been reported. Adverse events (AEs) have generally been mild 
in intensity. Based on the accumulated information, injection site reactions, dysgeusia and 
parosmia are considered to be adverse reactions associated with receipt of 18F-fluciclovine 
injection in humans; these events occurred in 17/1203 (1.4%) patients overall. 
Based upon preliminary data from the 2 IITs conducted at Emory University ( Schuster, 2003; 
Patel, 2018), and supported by [CONTACT_511904] 
18F-fluciclovine in other brain tumor settings ( Parent, 2018 ; Karlberg, 2019;  Michaud, 2020; 
Bogsrud, 2019; Henderson, 2019), BED is conducting the current clinical study 
(BED-FLC-219) as the Phase [ADDRESS_662089] common intracranial tumor in adults, occurring in up to 40% of 
patients with cancer ( Suh, 2010; Sinha, 2017), with approximately 200,000 patients affected 
each year in the US ( Arvold, 2016). Following localized treatment of brain metastases 
(increasingly, stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] alongside neurosurgical resection [ Kann, 2017; 
NCCN, 2019]), close follow-up with serial MRI of the brain is performed to evaluate for 
residual and recurrent disease. Conventional MRI is currently recommended as the main 
imaging test ( NCCN, 2019) following localized treatment, as it is widely available and offers 
high spatial resolution, with presence of recurrent disease suggested by [CONTACT_511905] (CE) depi[INVESTIGATOR_511887]/structural information. However, conventional MRI 
(CE-T1 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR]/T 2-weighted sequences) has limited 
specificity due to the incidence of treatment-related changes, primarily radiation necrosis 
(Galldiks, 2019). These treatment-related changes have similar appearances to true recurrence 
of disease on conventional MRI, including CE, origin near the primary tumor site, vasogenic 
edema, growth over time, and mass effect ( Langen, 2017 ; Langen, 2018; Pope, 2018).  
No specific feature or combination of features on conventional MRI has been established to 
differentiate between disease recurrence and treatment-related changes, including radiation 
necrosis and pseudoprogression ( Verma, 2013 ). Specificity of conventional MRI to diagnose 
recurrent tumor after SRS using visual reads has been reported to be as low as 19% ( Peng, 
2018), with attempts at validating permutations of neuroradiologist-defined measurements 
reporting specificities of 32% to 41% ( Dequesada, 2008 ; Stockham, 2012). Alongside the 
estimated 25% incidence rate of radiation necrosis ( Vellayappan, 2018), rates of true local 
recurrence of disease are similar, ranging from 27% to 31% ( Kocher, 2011 ; Brown, 2010). 
Therefore, the true prevalence of recurrent disease post-radiotherapy where conventional 
MRI indicates the possibility of recurrence, can be estimated to be approximately 50%.  
Guidelines and recommendations established by [CONTACT_337171]-Oncology (RANO) group recognize the limitations of conventional MRI, and in view 
of the lack of substantial evidence, do not yet advocate any advanced imaging technique 
when MRI features are suggestive, but equivocal, for recurrence of brain metastases ( Wen, 
2010; Lin, 2015). The management of patients with MRI findings suggestive, but equivocal, 
for recurrent brain metastases includes clinical monitoring or biopsy sampling ( Lin, 2015). 
Close clinical monitoring with repeat imaging may be performed in the hope that scan 
appearance resolves over time, but this is at the expense of delayed therapeutic decision 
making. Further, neurosurgical biopsy sampling is an invasive procedure that carries the 
associated risk of further deteriorating quality-of-life for patients already undergoing 
aggressive treatment (of their primary cancer) ( Verma, 2013 ). 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines list advanced MRI scans 
(magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, MR perfusion) and PET imaging as potentially 
useful techniques in differentiating tumor from treatment effect ( NCCN, 2019); however, the 
availability, acquisition, processing, interpretation and, therefore, diagnostic performance of 
advanced MRI scans vary considerably ( Zhang, 2017 ). In addition, the only PET imaging 
agent approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) for use in brain tumor 
imaging is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), which has notable limitations. Use of 18F-FDG in 
brain tumor imaging is limited in sensitivity and specificity, as differentiation of tumor from 
non-tumorous tissue is often difficult due to the high metabolic rate of normal brain 
parenchyma and inflammatory tissue ( Galldiks, 2019 ). 18F-FDG uptake in low-grade tumors 
can be similar to that in normal grey matter. The sensitivity of detection of lesions is further

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3  decreased by [CONTACT_511906] 18F-FDG uptake and its heterogeneity within a single tumor 
(Heiss, 2014).  
Given this area of great diagnostic unmet need, accurate imaging to differentiate disease 
recurrence from treatment-related changes is valuable for several reasons: 
 Identifying treatment-related changes is important to avoid unneeded treatment 
(e.g., surgery) and erroneously premature termination of potentially effective 
treatment ( Walker, 2014 ). 
 Accurate scans can inform the management decision of cessation of non-effective 
treatments, to minimize morbidity from treatment side effects ( Galldiks, 2019) 
and reduce the economic burden. 
 Timely diagnosis of true recurrence will allow prompt stratification of patients to 
further therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Galldiks, 2019), which may maximize therapeutic benefit and 
clinical outcome. 
 Given the high morbidity and mortality of patients with brain metastases and, 
therefore, the need for high quality clinical research, such imaging will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_511888], and accurate characterization of 
investigational therapeutic efficacy ( Lin, 2015 ). This particular need for certainty 
on optimal clinical trial endpoints has been recognized by [CONTACT_511907] (NBTS), leading to recent joint efforts to stimulate much 
needed research and development in this area ( FDA/NBTS, 2019). 
 Aiding the physician to risk-stratify continuation of a therapeutic regimen (where 
treatment-related changes can be confidently diagnosed). This is of particular 
value in the context of a treatment with a significant side effect profile. 
Limited clinical research has been conducted with other amino acid PET tracers in brain 
metastases, possibly in part due to highly limited availability in the US. Studies of brain 
metastases with amino acid PET tracers 18F-fluoro-ethyltyrosine (18F-FET), 
18F-fluoro-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) and 11C-methionine have all been 
described, with demonstration of increased tracer uptake and sensitivities of 79% to 95%, 
specificities of 84% to 93% for the detection of brain metastases where MRI is suggestive of 
recurrent disease ( Terakawa, 2008; Galldiks, 2012 ;Lizarraga, 2014; Cicone, 2015;  2015; 
Romagna, 2016; Ceccon, 2017). In recent recommendations by [CONTACT_511908], 
amino acid PET was recommended as useful in distinguishing post-therapeutic reactive 
changes following radiotherapy from recurrent brain metastases ( Galldiks, 2019). This was 
based on review of Level [ADDRESS_662090] been based on different methods of quantifying 
PET tracer uptake, and in the case of 18F-FET, incorporate the interpretation of dynamic scan

interpretation criteria in other amino acid PET tracers cannot be directly applied to 
18F-fluciclovine. 
The purpose of the current study is to take initial steps to address this area of diagnostic 
unmet need by [CONTACT_511909] 18F-fluciclovine PET in detecting 
recurrent brain metastases in adults with suspected recurrence after radiation therapy. 
2.1. Risk-Benefit Assessment 
2.1.1. Benefit 
The 18F-fluciclovine PET scans may provide further clinical information regarding the 
If such information arises, this may be considered by [CONTACT_511910], including guiding the planned surgery. This may provide a direct 
benefit to the subject. 
2.1.2. Risk 
The risks from the imaging studies to patients mainly relate to the intravenous (IV) injection 
and the radiation emitted by [CONTACT_511911] (when the 
PET scan is acquired on a PET/CT scanner). There is a potential risk of a hypersensitivity 
reaction requiring the availability of resuscitative equipment and personnel. Intravenous 
injection carries a small risk of infection and hematoma. 
The mean effective dose per unit administered activity of 18F-fluciclovine is 22.1 
(McParland, 2013). An administered activity of 5 mCi (185 MBq) will result in an effective 
dose of 4.1 mSv. If PET/CT is used, the effective dose due to CT acquisition should be in 
accordance with ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principles. The maximum 
effective dose due to a CT transmission scan will vary from site to site, but as a guide, a dose 
ranging from 0.5 mSv to 2.0 mSv would be expected. Combined with the effective dose from 
18F-fluciclovine (4.1 mSv), the total effective dose of the 18F-fluciclovine PET-CT scan of 
6.[ADDRESS_662091]-
18F-fluciclovine injection.   
Image interpretation errors can occur with 18F-fluciclovine PET brain imaging. Physiological 
distribution of 18F-fluciclovine does not rule out the presence of recurrent metastasis and 
18F-fluciclovine uptake within a lesion does not confirm the presence of recurrent metastasis. 
18F-fluciclovine uptake is not specific for brain metastases and may occur with other types of 
malignancy in or around the brain. There may be uptake in other conditions such as active 
multiple sclerosis, brain abscess, and meningioma. Accordingly, as the responsible clinician 
may consider information from the 18F-
management, there is a potential risk of additional resections/biopsies including those that are 
ultimately unnecessary.

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3  4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1. Study Overview 
This is a prospective, open label, single arm, single dose study in subjects with solid tumor 
brain metastases previously treated with radiation therapy, designed to define image 
interpretation criteria for 18F-fluciclovine PET in detecting recurrent brain metastases (when 
read with standard MRI for anatomical reference). 
Subjects with a history of brain metastases previously treated with primary, adjuvant or 
repeat (salvage) radiation therapy, with a recent SoC brain MRI found to be equivocal for 
recurrent brain metastasis, and who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria, will be consented and enrolled. Sites are encouraged to enroll subjects with a variety 
of primary tumor types. In order to ensure variation in tumor types on the study population, 
the number of subjects with lung cancer will be capped at approximately 60% of enrolled 
subjects. 
On-site investigators will prospectively annotate and measure on a 
post-radiation treatment MRI scan and on the SoC MRI brain scan to confirm eligibility. The 
lesion which is: 
 equivocal for recurrent metastasis on SoC MRI (according to inclusion 
criterion #7, see Section 6.2); 
 intended for pre-planned SoC craniotomy; and 
 if >[ADDRESS_662092] of these lesions. 
If >1 equivocal lesion is intended for resection, the on-site investigator will also annotate and 
measure SoC MRI brain scan, 
defined by [CONTACT_511912] a reference lesion per inclusion criterion #7 (see 
Section 6.2). 
All eligible subjects will receive an 18F-fluciclovine PET scan (Visit 2 PET) within 42 days 
of SoC MRI. Subjects will then undergo a repeat study-specific brain MRI scan (Visit 2 
On-Study MRI) to be used as anatomical reference for the 18F-fluciclovine PET scan. The 
Visit 2 On-Study MRI should be done  days after Visit 
2 PET and completed before the pre-planned SoC craniotomy. A safety follow-up (Visit 3) 
1 to 3 days after Visit 2 PET will be made for AE evaluation by [CONTACT_511913] (if 
same day as scheduled SoC craniotomy). AEs occurring from the time of 18F-fluciclovine 
administration until [ADDRESS_662093] a minimum of 1 day and maximum of 21 days before pre-planned 
SoC craniotomy. 
The on-site investigator will review the 18F-fluciclovine PET scan to identify, annotate and 
measure potential additional lesions, not previously reported on SoC MRI 
. Additional PET lesions should be annotated only where judged suggestive of 
brain metastasis, warranting confirmation according to SoC practice, be neurosurgically 
feasible and accordingly, planned for biopsy or resection. Undertaking biopsy / resection of 
additional PET lesion(s) identified on the 18F-fluciclovine PET scan is at the discretion of on-
site investigators. Moreover, an additional PET lesion should be discrete and spatially 
separate from known, pre-existing lesions. In particular, the following should not be 
annotated as Additional PET lesions: known pre-existing non-progressive lesions (considered

known lesion (previously annotated or otherwise) and apparently incongruent with the 
image registration. 
For each subject, the final visit will usually be the preplanned SoC craniotomy/surgery at 
Visit 4. The subject will receive post-procedural management per institutional SoC. All 
ongoing follow-up and any further treatment will be in accordance with SoC and will not be 
recorded, including all medications and SoC procedure-related events occurring at and 
beyond Visit 4, and any SoC follow-up.   
Subject-level SoT will be defined by [CONTACT_511914]. Lesion-level SoT will be defined by [CONTACT_511915] (reference lesions, MRI surgical lesions, additional PET lesions). Separately, central 
image analysis will define qualitative and quantitative lesion uptake of 18F-fluciclovine, for 
each resected lesion. These results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_511916]. 
4.2. Concurrent Enrollment with BED-FLC-312 
Subjects who are enrolled in BED-FLC-312 and during its Follow-Up period are deemed to 
require a SoC craniotomy for diagnostic evaluation of an equivocal lesion, may be enrolled 
into BED-FLC-219 while remaining enrolled in BED-FLC-312. Subjects may be enrolled 
any time during the BED-FLC-312 Follow-Up period after Day 22 (i.e., after the full 21-day 
maximum timeframe for completion of the BED-FLC-312 Visit 4 neurosurgical procedure). 
For absolute clarity, this will be irrespective of the applicability of BED-FLC-[ADDRESS_662094]. Such subjects will be required to sign an informed consent form and meet all 
eligibility requirements for BED-FLC-219, including availability of the SoC MRI within the 
specified timeframe and reference lesion definitions. All BED-FLC-219 procedures remain 
applicable to any such concurrently enrolled subjects. Interim enrollment in BED-FLC-219 
nt ongoing participation in BED-FLC-312.

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3  9.1. Clinical Assessments 
9.1.1. Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medication and concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82955] 
(Visit 1), at IMP administration (Visit 2) and at the post-treatment Safety Follow-up phone 
call (Visit 3), and at early termination when applicable. Dose, route, frequency of 
administration, and indication for administration and dates of medication will be captured. 
9.1.2. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic information recorded at Screening will include age, sex, race and ethnicity. 
Baseline assessments of pre-scan body weight and height will be collected at Visit 2.  
9.1.3. ECOG Performance Status 
Conduct ECOG Performance Status assessment at Screening (Visit 1) or record a standard of 
care ECOG Performance Status if the assessment was performed within 28 days prior to 
Screening (Visit 1) (see Appendix 1). 
9.1.4. Medical History  
Record medical and disease history at Screening (Visit 1). Include history for previous brain 
metastases and brain metastases treatments, diagnosis of primary tumor and previous 
treatments of primary tumor, and any other previous cancers, as applicable. Brain metastases 
and primary tumor histories should include dates of initial diagnosis, initial tumor stage, dates 
and type of definitive therapy and adjuvant treatment (if given). Any changes to the subject
medical condition between Screening (Visit 1) and the start of 18F-fluciclovine administration 
(Visit 2) should be recorded as updated medical history. 
9.1.5. Imaging Studies 
Sites will be instructed to submit historic SoC imaging data required to confirm eligibility. 
Submitted MRI scans should confirm the reference lesion criteria, outlined in Section 6.2. 
Therefore, these should be the MRI scan confirming reference lesion nadir or showing 
complete lesion response, the current SoC MRI brain scan performed before Screening 
(Visit 1), and may include the pre-treatment MRI if available. Sites will annotate and measure 
the reference lesion and MRI surgical lesions on the current SoC MRI brain scan using the 
imaging core lab study imaging platform.  
The reference lesion is defined as the lesion which is: 
a. equivocal for recurrent metastasis on SoC MRI (according to inclusion criterion #7, 
see Section 6.2); 
b. intended for pre-planned SoC craniotomy; and

and an on-study MRI brain scan performed 0 to 3 days after the 18F-fluciclovine PET scan 
(Visit 2).  
The site investigator will review the 18F-fluciclovine PET scan to identify potential additional 
PET lesions should be annotated only where judged suggestive of brain metastasis, 
warranting confirmation according to SoC practice, be neurosurgically feasible and 
accordingly, planned for biopsy/resection. Moreover, an additional PET lesion should be 
discrete and spatially separate from known, pre-existing lesions. In particular, the following 
should not be annotated as Additional PET lesions: known pre-existing non-progressive 
lesions (considered at site level as stable or partially responding), 18F-fluciclovine activity 
contiguous with a known lesion (previously annotated or otherwise) and apparently 
incongruent 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_511922]. 
The investigator will then annotate the additional PET lesions on the 18F-fluciclovine PET 
scan using the imaging core lab study imaging platform. The site investigator will also 
confirm the sites of the reference and MRI surgical lesions on the Visit 2 scans. 
For each annotated lesion, a lesion identifier will be automatically created and assigned by 
[CONTACT_511923]. For each annotated lesion, the site will also be 
required to specify the anatomical location. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. 18F-fluciclovine PET Scan 
Dynamic PET/CT or PET/MRI scan of the brain is to be performed at Visit 2 following 
18F-fluciclovine injection. If the PET scan is performed on a PET/CT scanner, a CT scan of 
the brain will also be performed for attenuation correction. Site investigator will review the 
18F-fluciclovine PET scan to identify potential additional PET lesions (this will be done with 
the Visit 2 MRI scan for anatomical reference). The PET scan will be uploaded to central 
imaging core lab by [CONTACT_88567]/site staff. The selected PET scanner must be qualified by 
[CONTACT_511924]. Full details on the imaging protocol 
are provided in the Image Acquisition Standards. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. On-Study MRI 
Throughout this study, 18F-fluciclovine PET will be read with standard MRI for anatomical 
reference. Therefore, all subjects will receive an on-study, study-specific brain MRI scan at 
On-study 
MRI will consist of MRI sequences per the minimum standard consensus recommendations 
for a standardized brain tumor imaging protocol for clinical trials in brain metastases 
(BTIP-BM) ( Kaufmann, 2020). These will include:  
 T1-weighted MRI without and with contrast enhancement, and  
 FLAIR and/or T 2-weighted MRI, and 
 Diffusion-weighted imaging. 
On-study MRI brain scan will be uploaded to central imaging core lab by [CONTACT_88567]/site 
staff. In addition to reviewing the 18F-fluciclovine PET scan to identify potential additional 
PET lesions, the site investigator will confirm the sites of the reference lesion and if 
applicable, MRI surgical lesions (i.e., other lesions already planned for resection per SoC).

Vital signs including body temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_511890] 2 (IMP injection + PET) after resting for at least [ADDRESS_662104] 5 minutes following PET scan. The vital signs should 
be collected between 5 to 60 minutes before and after the PET scan. 
9.1.7. SoC Craniotomy / Surgery 
Craniotomy procedure to take place as planned for SoC, for surgical resection of the 
reference lesion and MRI surgical lesions, and biopsy / surgical resection of any additional 
PET lesions if clinically applicable. En bloc resection is to be performed where possible. 
Where en bloc resection is not possible, the surgeon should try and send as much of the 
sample as possible to enable optimal histopathology assessment. Care should be taken to 
follow the Sample Handling Laboratory Manual to label all samples sent to the site pathology 
laboratory, and to reflect the locations sampled and lesion identifiers assigned by [CONTACT_511925]. 
The site pathology laboratory will perform histopathology analysis per SoC and will send a 
representative set of specimens with their matching lesion identifiers to the central laboratory 
for analysis. Refer to Sample Handling Laboratory Manual.

Patients should be advised not to eat for at least [ADDRESS_662116] water or other clear fluids within this time 
window. 
11.2. PET/CT Scanner 
A dedicated hybrid PET scanner (e.g., PET/CT, PET/MRI) is mandatory. The selected PET 
scanner must be qualified by [CONTACT_289417]. 
11.3. 18F-fluciclovine Injection Administration 
See Section 8.[ADDRESS_662117] acquisition (if acquired on a PET/CT scanner), an unenhanced (no IV contrast) CT 
will be employed. 
11.5. On-Study MRI Acquisition 
All subjects will receive an on-study, study-specific brain MRI scan consisting of standard 
MRI sequences including (1) T 1-weighted MRI without and with contrast enhancement, (2) 
FLAIR and/or T 2-weighted MRI, and (3) diffusion-weighted imaging, ideally on the same 
day as the PET scan or up to a maximum of 3 days after the PET scan.  
11.6. Image Transfer 
Following the completion of PET and on-study MRI imaging at the study site, the scan data 
will be sent to the Imaging Core Lab using either the Imaging Management Solution software 
or on physical media by [CONTACT_30367]. 
11.7. Image Evaluability 
Both PET and on-study MRI scans will be assessed by [CONTACT_511931]. All data will undergo quality control including 
technical analysis, indication and protocol specific criteria, based on parameters detailed in 
the Image Acquisition Standards.   
11.8. Central Image Analysis 
Central image analysis of 18F-fluciclovine PET, with Visit 2 on-study MRI used for 
anatomical reference, will be performed by 3 independent readers blinded to all clinical 
information.

Qualitative analysis: 3 independent reader evaluation, with Visit 2 on-study MRI 
used for anatomical reference. 
 18F-fluciclovine uptake of all sampled lesions, including the reference lesion, will 
be determined from static imaging data (e.g., from 10-[ADDRESS_662118]-injection), 
using the following definitions: 
 Absent  18F-fluciclovine uptake indistinguishable from surrounding 
structurally normal brain parenchyma 
 Mild  18F-fluciclovine uptake above surrounding structurally normal brain 
parenchyma, up to or similar to blood pool in the venous sinuses 
 Moderate  18F-fluciclovine uptake higher than blood pool, up to or similar to 
parotid glands (if parotid gland uptake is asymmetrical, uptake in the gland 
with higher uptake is used as reference).  Marked  18F-fluciclovine uptake higher than parotid glands. 
 Time activity curve (TAC) based on 18F-fluciclovine uptake of all sampled 
lesions, including the reference lesion, on dynamic imaging data will be derived 
from the following image acquisition frame sequences: first 10 min after 
injection - 12 frames of 5 s, 6 frames of 10 s, 6 frames of 30 s and 5 frames of 
60 s; from 10 min to 30 min after injection  5 minute acquisition frames (Law, 
2018). 
 Type 0: absent uptake 
 Type I: continuous increase in uptake throughout the study 
 Type II: initial uptake followed by [CONTACT_511932]: relatively rapid uptake with reduction in uptake later in the study 
Quantitative analysis 
 Lesion(s) and background structures will be outlined visually on static imaging 
data (e.g., from 10-[ADDRESS_662119]-injection). This will be performed by [CONTACT_63931] 
3 independent readers performing the qualitative analysis. 
 Perform quantitative measure of background activity: mean standardized uptake 
value (SUV mean). 
 Perform quantitative measures of lesion 18F-fluciclovine uptake, including: 
maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max), peak standardized uptake value 
(SUV peak), maximum tumor: background ratio (TBR max; tumor SUV max: SUV mean 
background), peak tumor: background ratio (TBR peak; tumor SUV peak, background 
SUV mean). 
2. Central histopathology 
 Specimens will be centrally reviewed. Detailed specification of this workflow, and 
assignment of recurrent metastasis (positive) vs no recurrent metastasis (negative) 
based on the central review, will be laid out prospectively in a histopathology 
charter.

CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3  12.3. Adverse Event Relationship to IMP 
The relationship of an AE to IMP will be categorized as follows: 
Related:  when there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between IMP 
administration and an AE (i.e., adverse drug reaction [ADR]) 
Not related:  when an AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from IMP 
administration or when an AE can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_511933], concomitant drugs or concurrent treatment. 
12.4. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is defined as any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death 
 a life-threatening adverse experience 
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
12.4.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) on an 
SAE Report Form. The collection period for all SAEs will begin after initiation of 
18F-fluciclovine injection and end at Day 2. After this point, the investigator is not required to 
actively solicit SAE information from subjects. However, if they should become aware of an 
SAE that they suspect is related to the IMP, then they should report it. Any unresolved SAE 
beyond Day [ADDRESS_662123] be reported within 24 hours of the site study team becoming aware of the 
event by [CONTACT_511934], or scanned and emailed, to: 
Bracco Diagnostics Inc. Drug Safety Unit:  
[EMAIL_6745] 
Fax: +[PHONE_10633] 
Additional and further requested information (follow-up or corrections to the original event) 
will be detailed on a new SAE Report Form and faxed/emailed to the same address. 
For the US, in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) the site investigator 
will report SAEs to the IRB/IEC.  
12.4.2. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
A S[LOCATION_003]R is a serious adverse reaction, the nature and severity of which is not consistent 
with the reference safety information set out in the

13.1. Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. 
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a subject for the following reasons:   
 Significant protocol violation or non-compliance 
 If any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best 
interests of the subject (investigator decision) 
 Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment 
 If the subject meets the exclusion criteria (either newly developed or not 
previously recognized) that precludes further study participation 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Sponsor request for early termination of study 
 Subject requests to be withdrawn from the study 
 Positive pregnancy test (females). 
The reason for subject discontinuation or withdrawal from the study, if known, will be 
recorded  in the eCRF. 
Refer to Section 10.6 for early withdrawal procedures. 
13.2. Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who sign the informed consent form (ICF) and do not receive the study scan may be 
replaced. Subjects who sign the ICF and receive the study scan, but the scan is not considered 
evaluable (refer to Section 11 of the Imaging Protocol), may be replaced. Subjects who sign 
the ICF, and receive the study scan, and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or 
discontinued from the study, prior to completed reference lesion resection at 
craniotomy/surgery, may be replaced.  
13.3. Lost to Follow-up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she fails to complete the Visit [ADDRESS_662125]-
IMP safety follow-up phone call or fails to continue through to Visit 4/Day 2-22 for SoC 
craniotomy/surgery and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_136589].  
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to complete a required study visit: 
 The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_511935]-scheduled Visit 4/Day 2-22 SoC craniotomy/surgery and ascertain if the 
subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study 
 Before a subject is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will

primary endpoint criteria. Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
 Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria 
 Use of a prohibited concomitant medication 
 Use of a non-validated scanner or imaging technique 
Significant non-compliance from Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in 
a protocol violation. The Sponsor will determine if a protocol violation will result in 
withdrawal of a subject. 
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and reported to

BED-FLC-219 Protocol Version 3.0, 10 June 2021                                             Page 52 of 67  
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3  15. STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS 
Prior to database lock and analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) will be prepared and approved, describing all analyses to be performed. The SAP will 
document any changes to the analyses described below. Continuous data will be summarized 
using mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Categorical data will be 
summarized using frequency counts and percentages. 
15.1. Estimation of Sample Size 
Up to 40 subjects are planned for enrollment. The sample size is not calculated based on 
formal statistical hypothesis testing criteria but is estimated to provide sufficient numbers of 
subjects and data to establish image interpretation criteria.  15.2. Analysis Sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all enrolled subjects dosed with IMP with an 
evaluable Visit 2 on-study PET scan.  
The Safety Analysis Set (SAF) will be used for all safety analyses, and include all subjects 
who have been dosed with IMP (with or without the associated PET scan).   
The Imaging Evaluable Analysis Set (IEAS) includes all subjects who have been dosed with 
IMP, have evaluable Visit 2 on-study PET scan (see Section 11.7)  , and an evaluable central 
histopathology report (defined in the Histopathology Charter) from the sample obtained from 
the Visit [ADDRESS_662128] disposition will be summarized for all subjects who entered the study. Summaries 
will include the number and percentage of subjects in each analysis set, completing the study, 
and discontinuing the study early by [CONTACT_46689]. 
15.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic variables (including age, sex, ethnicity and race) and baseline characteristics 
(e.g., height, weight, body mass index [to be calculated], ECOG performance status, medical 
history, prior treatment history) will be summarized using appropriate summary statistics for 
the FAS, SAF and IEAS.  
15.5. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV) 
of different thresholds of lesion 18F-fluciclovine uptake on visual reads (as defined by [CONTACT_511937]) versus SoT derived from central 
histopathological analysis of all lesions, at subject-level and lesion-level.  
BED-FLC-219 Protocol Version 3.0, 10 June 2021                                             Page 53 of 67  
CONFIDENTIAL Blue Earth Diagnostics  Based on Protocol Template, SOP-MED-002-AD-2, Version 3  Three thresholds of lesion 18F-fluciclovine uptake, derived from visual reads in the 
3 independent reader evaluation, will be considered: 
Threshold Combination of degree of uptake 
Mild or higher uptake Absent uptake vs (Mild + Moderate + Marked uptake) 
Moderate or higher uptake (Absent + Mild uptake) vs (Moderate + Marked uptake) 
Marked uptake (Absent + Mild + Moderate uptake) vs Marked uptake 
Estimates and the 95% exact confidence intervals for sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV 
for each threshold will be calculated using standard definitions: 
 Tumor Present (SoT) Tumor Absent (SoT) 
Threshold Met  True positive False positive 
Threshold Not Met  False negative True negative 
 Sensitivity (% of true positives) = true positive / (true positive + false negative) 
 Specificity (% of true negatives) = true negative / (true negative + false positive) 
 PPV = true positive / (true positive + false positive) 
 NPV = true negative / (true negative + false negative) 
Subject-level diagnostic performance will be calculated based on reference lesion data, while 
lesion-level diagnostic performance will be calculated based on data of all sampled lesions.  
Lesions annotated on the scans will be matched to the histopathology results based on the 
lesion identifiers assigned by [CONTACT_511938].  The results of 
these analyses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_511939] (consisting 
of representatives from the Sponsor, contracted imaging core lab, and expert readers) to 
determine image interpretation criteria based on visual reads. 
15.6. Analysis of Secondary Endpoint(s) 
In order to establish other image interpretation criteria for 18F-fluciclovine PET in detecting 
recurrent brain metastases, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of SoT against 
the quantitative measures of lesion 18F-fluciclovine uptake will be performed. For dynamic 
measures of lesion 18F-fluciclovine uptake represented by [CONTACT_511940], applying each TAC 
category as a diagnostic criterion, estimates and the 95% exact confidence intervals for 
sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for each of the [ADDRESS_662129] definitions stated above.  
These analyses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_511941] 
a set of image interpretation criteria based on the quantitative and dynamic measures. 
Subsequently, for the diagnostic performance secondary endpoints, estimates and the 95% 
exact confidence intervals for sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV will be calculated based 
on the recommended thresholds from the following combination of interpretation criteria (if 
featured in the interpretation criteria): 
1. Visual assessment of level of lesion 18F-fluciclovine uptake 
BED-FLC-[ADDRESS_662130] performing quantitative measure (based on ROC analysis)  
Subject-level diagnostic performance will be calculated based on reference lesion data, while 
lesion-level diagnostic performance will be calculated based on data of all sampled lesions.   
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as those AEs with onset after the 
dose of IMP, or existing events that worsened after the dose of IMP during the study, up to [ADDRESS_662131] version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). Severity of AEs will be graded using the NCI-CTCAE v5.0. The 
frequency of TEAEs will be summarized overall, by [CONTACT_6657], 
and by [CONTACT_926]. IMP-related AEs and SAEs will also be summarized.

 A.  BACKGROUND & SIGNIFICANCE  
Overview - Tobacco Cessation Treatments  
Tobacco use kills 480,000 individuals in the [LOCATION_002] each year.1 Morbidity and 
mortality from tobacco use dwarfs all other preventable causes of mortality (alcohol, 
accidents, homicide, etc.) combined2 Most tobacco users want to quit, yet unlike other 
individuals who are dependent on illicit drugs or alcohol, they rarely seek formal treatment 
from physicians or cessation programs.[ADDRESS_263352] tobacco users attempt to go “cold 
turkey” and most fail numerous times before quitting.4,[ADDRESS_263353], on any quit attempt, only 
about 6% of smokers achieve long -term success.6  
At present, there are five forms of NRT available in the U.S. (gum, patch, lozenge, 
nasal spray and inhaler), and two forms of non -nicotine medication (bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_219134]  [brand name [CONTACT_219190] ™]). Quit rates can be doubled using cessation 
medications,7,[ADDRESS_263354] to consumer marketing by 
[CONTACT_219160], fewer than one in five smokers use some form of NRT during a 
quit attempt, either prescribed by a health care provider or over-the-counter ( OTC ).[ADDRESS_263355] effective medication for smoking cessation.14-24 However, because it requires a 
prescription and fear of the box warning required by [CONTACT_1622] (see below), use of varenicline 
has been lower than NRT even though it is significantly more effective. Now that the box 
warning has been removed ( Chantix ™ label update, December 2016) , it is essential to 
move more smokers who want to quit onto varenicline so th at we can decrease smoking 
prevalence at a n increased  rapid pace.  
  
Vareniclin e History  
Varenicline acts as a partial agonist and does not produce the same intensity of 
response as a full agonist, even at high doses. Thus, the drug is classified as a selective 
nicotine receptor partial agonist (SNRPA) that works both to stimulate the nicotine receptor 
and block smoking reward at the α4β2 nicotinic receptor subtype.22 Of the many nicotine 
receptor subtypes, the α4β2 receptor is thought to mediate the rewarding properties of 
nicotine by [CONTACT_219161] (NA), or so -called 
“pleasure center” of the brain. In addition to its agonis t effect, varenicline also has a powerful 
competitive antagonist effect on nicotine, due primarily to a substantially higher affinity for the 
α4ß2 receptor.[ADDRESS_263356] missed is that a Phase II study completed 
by [CONTACT_219162]18 prior to the FDA approval showed that .5mg b.i.d . - half the dose of 
varenicline now recommended – appears to be as effective as the FDA -approved 1mg b.i.d.  
dose and results in fewer side effects. In the Oncken et al6 study, participants received 
behavioral intervention at each visit, so it was not an OTC study, but given these results, it is 
Protocol #1R01DA044125  ver January 26, [ADDRESS_263357] -
marketing reports of psychiatric adverse events including suicidal ideation and suicidal 
behavior led the FDA to require a box warning for varenicline in 2008.25-28 At the same time, 
the FDA required a similar box warning for bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], another prescription smoking cessation 
medication. The label change led to significantly less use of varenicline . Multiple studies 
(observational and RCTs) completed over the past eight years have provided strong evidence 
that the prevalence of these adverse events (AEs) was no greater than for placebo or NRT.28-
[ADDRESS_263358] smoking cessation clinical trial 
ever conducted – which compared the safety and efficacy of varenicline, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_219135] – and indicated that they w ould not consider removing the box 
warning until the results of that study were available. The results of that study, called 
EAGLES, were recently published.[ADDRESS_263359] analyzed the outcomes of over 116,000 
smokers prescribed varenicline via the large Optum Labs clinical d ataset, and those analyses 
reinforce the Eagles study:  IDC9 coding showed that fewer than 1% of those with and without 
a pre -existing psychiatric diagnoses experienced suicidal ideation or suicide attempts after 
they were prescribed varenicline.  Given th ese new results, b oth the FDA and the European 
Union ha ve removed the box warning  from varenicline , but the Warning and Precaution for 
potential psychiatric side effects still remains.  
  Other rare safety concerns in the package insert include seizures, new or worsening 
heart or blood pressure problems, sleepwalking, increased sensitivity to alcohol, and serious 
allergic or skin reactions.    
Our Research on Rx to OTC switch. Our team has conducted multiple clinical trials 
to assess the safety and efficacy of smoking cessation medications as potential OTC 
products. With funding from NIDA, Leischow et al randomized smokers to receive nicotine 
patch in either an OTC condition or a health care provider (HCP) intervention.12 Finally, in the 
only study published to date on the efficacy of switching the nicotine inhaler from Rx to OTC,11 
we randomized smokers (n=500) to either an OTC or Rx condition and found that the R x 
group had significantly higher quit rates at each time point than the OTC group except at 
week 52, and the OTC group quit rates were only 6% at one year (similar to using no 
medication).  
  [CONTACT_219198] enrolled 550 subjects in a 3 -site nicotine patch OTC switch study in 1994. 
The study compared 6 weeks of 21mg patches versus placebo in a quasi -OTC storefront or 
office -building environment. At the end of treatment,16.8% in the active group vs. 9 .6% in the 
placebo group had quit smoking. In a comparison arm in which participants paid to receive 
active patches, the quit rate was 19%.  
Lastly, both [CONTACT_219198] and Leischow recently recruited over [ADDRESS_263360] in common is exploring whether a smoking cessation 
can be effective and safe when provided without behavioral support.  The focus of the current 
study is to likewise assess whether varenicline can be safe and effective when no behavioral 
support is provided.  
 
Protocol #1R01DA044125  ver January 26, 2021               Page 5 of 43 
 
  
B.  SPECIFIC AIMS  
Three of the NRT products (i .e. patch, gum, and lozenge ) are available as over -the-
counter (OTC) products because clinical trials have shown  that they are safe and effective  
without healthcare provider involvement.  The other two NRT products are not OTC for 
different reasons. The nasal spray has not been formally tested,  perhaps because it is 
aversive when first used and has some potential for abuse liability . The nicotine inhaler is not 
effective as an OTC medication .[ADDRESS_263361] not 
been considered for OTC status , in part because both had a ‘box warning’ placed on them by 
[CONTACT_219163] . After m ultiple  studies , including one of the largest smoking 
cessation trials (‘EAGLES ’ study) ever conducted ,[ADDRESS_263362] been shown to be comparable to the OTC nicotine 
patch, this research will assess whether varenicline , in two different doses,  can be safe and 
effective without a healthcare provider prescription.  More specifically, b ecause earlier 
research found that .5mg  twice a day  (b.i.d. ) varenicline is as effective as the currently FDA -
approved 1.0mg b.i.d . dosing  but with lower incidence of nausea and sleep disturbance6, 
there is value in assessing whether the lower dose will work as well as the higher dose  in an 
OTC environment . Lastly, t o understand the within -person mechanisms explaining how and 
when  OTC varenicline might improve cessation outcomes,  as well as how side effects affect 
medication adherence,  we will also  assess experience with OTC varenicline via ecological 
momentary assessment (EMA).  
 
Primary Objectives  
1. To assess the safety and eff icacy  of the current FDA -approved [ADDRESS_263363] specific characteristics (e.g. socioeconomic status, ethnicity, 
smoking history, etc.) moderate primary (safety and efficacy) and secondary (adherence) 
outcomes.  
2. To evaluate medication use patterns to assess whether varenicline is being used as 
indicated on the label, and to determine if medication adherence mediates cessation 
outcomes  between -subjects.  
Protocol #1R01DA044125  ver January 26, 2021               Page 6 of 43 
 
 3. In a subsample of participants, t o examine how medication adherence, withdrawal, and 
side effects (e.g. nausea and sleep disturbance) vary within -subjects and are associated with 
smoking status  using EMA  in the first two critical weeks  of medication use .  
 
Hypotheses  
1. Quit rates in the [ADDRESS_263364] in the placebo 
group.  
 
C. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS  
Study Design   
The primary objective of this study is to assess the ef ficacy  of two different doses of 
varenicline used in a simulated OTC intervention relative to placebo  (total N = 432). The 
design is a three -group placebo -controlled, double blind, block randomized clinical trial (as 
indicated in the figure), where participants will be randomly assigned to one of three 
conditions:  (1) 1 mg 
b.i.d. varenicline for 
12 weeks, which is 
the current FDA -
approved dose , (2) 
0.5 mg b.i.d. 
varenicline for 12 
weeks, or (3) 
placebo.   
 In addition, we will collect EMA data from [ADDRESS_263365] are the within -person relationships between medication use 
(e.g., adherence), medication safety (e .g., adverse events), quit rates (self -report and 
biochemically validated), and factors that are associated with specific treatment outcomes . 
 
Study site s  
This study will be implemented at both Los Angeles Clinical Trials (LACT) and the Arizona 
State University . [CONTACT_219198] will implement the study in Los Angeles ; [CONTACT_219199] will 
implement the study in Phoenix.  
Human Subjects Protection .  Western IRB (WIRB) will be the IRB of record for this 
study, and the ASU IRB will receive the W IRB approvals and maintain documentation 
because it is the institution that has received funding from NIH.  WIRB approval is required for 
study implementation.  WIRB will maintain records for the study, and the ASU IRB will 
maintain a copy.  
 
Recruitment . We are making changes below due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  The COVID -19 
pandemic has resulted in a drop in the number of potential participants contact[CONTACT_219164]. Due to the lower number of respondents , we 
would like to increase the geographical area from which we are recruiting. By [CONTACT_219165] 1mg b.i.d. (n=144)  
Varenicline 0.5mg b.i.d. (n=144)  
Placebo 0mg b.i.d. (n=144)  
Protocol #1R01DA044125  ver January 26, [ADDRESS_263366] : one in -person  cohort,  and one remote  
cohort . We will  recruit  both cohorts via paid and free (e.g. Craigslist , Facebook, etc. ) 
advertisement s, as we have for other studies. W e anticipate , based on previous studies , that 
we will need to recruit well over 2500  potential participants , of which 700 will be screened  
before 432 will ultimately  be randomized.  Fortunately, both sites can draw from large local 
populations that are demographically diverse . 
 
Participants . We will recruit male and female smokers of any race/ethnicity who are at least 
21 years of age (with no upper age  limit) . Our anticipated recruitment plan is:  60%  male, 80%  
white, 10% black, 7% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 3% Hispanic. No vulnerable 
populations (eg incarcerated, mentally handicapped, etc) will be included ; the specific 
inclusion/exclusion are below.

will assess at each visit whether subjects used any behavioral support available in the 
community.  
 
Risk/ Benefit Assessment  
Risk Category.  Greater than minimal risk  
Potential Risk.  The most recent data found that varenicline does not result in 
greater risk than nicotine patch, which is already an over -the-counter medication, and that 
led the FDA to remove the box warning on varenicline.  The most common side effects of 
varenicline are: nausea, sleep problems (trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], vivid, unusual, or strange 
dreams), constipation, and gas and/or vomiting, and there is a very small risk that a 
participant could develop an allergic reaction to varenicline.  In addition, the product 
warnings indicate that: “Some people have had new or worse mental health problems, such 
as changes in behavior or thinking, aggression, hostility, agitation, depressed mood, or 
suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_219138] . These symptoms 
happened more often in people who had a history of mental health problems. Some people 
have had seizures during treatment with varenicline . New or worse heart or blood vessel 
problems can happen with varenicline . Sleepwalking can happen with varenicline , and can 
sometimes lead to harmful behavior.31” 
Participants might also experience withdrawal symptoms from quitting smoking, 
including urge to smoke, depressed mood, trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], irritability, frustration, anger, 
feeling anxious, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, decreased heart rate, increa sed 
appetite or weight gain.  
Protection Against Risks.  Product information provided to participants will 
encourage them to use the product with a full glass of water after eating a meal.  The 
product information will encourage use caution when using machinery or driving, and to

 Doses:  0.[ADDRESS_263380] Form:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_219139]: Oral, with water  
 Manufacturer:  [COMPANY_007]  
 
Varenicline  and Placebo . In this study, participants will be randomly assigned in 
double -blind fashion to use one of two doses of varenicline (.5 mg b.i.d. or 1.0mg b.i.d.) or 
placebo  (see study design above) . Both varenicline and the placebo will look identical and 
be in identical packaging .  
Medication Dosing . Participants assigned to the 1.0  mg b.i.d. condition, which is 
the current FDA -recommended  dosing, will follow the recommended varenicline titrated 
dosing schedule as follows: days 1 through 3: 0.5mg, one daily ; days 4 through 7: 0.5mg, 
twice daily; days 8 through end of treatment: 1mg, twice daily . Those assigned to the [ADDRESS_263381] 7 days (1 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_219140] 1 -3, 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_219141]).  All participants will take 
identical looking pi[INVESTIGATOR_219142], with the only difference being 
the amount of varenicline included in each pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].   
Product Packaging . Medication packaging for this study will be implemented at the 
ASU site. Two study staff will work together to package the medications, and all packaging 
will be double checked and tracking forms maintained by [CONTACT_219177].  
Medications will be shipped by [CONTACT_219178]  (or directly to participants if 
they are participating in the study remotely ), where study product will be checked and a 
report provided back to ASU within [ADDRESS_263382] will be packaged fo r each in-person cohort study visit as follows: (1) 
Baseline to Week  4:  During the first week after baseline, when participants  start and ramp 
up their dose, standard multi -compartment pi[INVESTIGATOR_219143] (as indicated above) .  In addition, 
participants will be provided [ADDRESS_263383] 
child resistant -pi[INVESTIGATOR_73586]. This will allow for an extra 7 days of IP to  account for delays in 
attending the Week 4 visit.  (2) Week 4 and Week 8:  Medication will be provided in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_219144] #1R01DA044125  ver January 26, [ADDRESS_263384] will be packaged for the remote cohort  as follows: product will be mailed  
after the second baseline visit. T he first week of starting the medication , when participants 
start and ramp up their dose, standard 7-day multi -compartment pi[INVESTIGATOR_219145] (as indicated 
above).   In addition, participants will be provided [ADDRESS_263385] time  (Screening/ Baseline 1 or 2 ), they will be given a consumer -friendly 
handout , Chantix  Use and Safety Information (Appendix 12)  that includes information on 
how to use the medication, smoking cessation withdrawal symptoms, side effects and 
adverse events , and information on smoking cessation quitlines. This handout is a 
modification of the FDA -approved Chantix Medication Guide (Appendix 14), which was 
modified to meet needs of the study.  The handout will include information on  setting a quit 
date that exists on the Chantix ™ website . The recommendation will be to set a quit date for 
Day [ADDRESS_263386] demonstrated that 
varenicline has a safety profile  that is very similar to NRT5. Clinical trials to date indicate that 
varenicline utilization results in very few serious adverse events. However, we will take 
tracking and management of adverse events very seriously (as we have in our previous 
studies).  As indicated above, we will make sure to assess adverse events that might reflect 
exacerbation of any reported or unreported psychiatric disorders.  
Adverse Event  (AE) Defin itions . Any negative event subsequent to signing 
consent but prior to the week 13 visit will be considered a potential adverse event to be 
addressed and followed, regardless of whether it is related to use of study medication.  
Examples of AEs include: (1) Clinical signs and symptoms, (2) Abnormal test results, (3) 
Worsening of existing medical conditions. The licensed medical professional (LMP) will 
consider a dverse events serious if the event: (1) is life threatening, (2) results in death, (3) 
leads to incapacity, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or serious  impairment of normal life , (4) congenital 
abnormality or birth defect .  Serious AEs will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_263387] be followed and recorded, such that subsequent to the designation each event 
Protocol #1R01DA044125  ver January 26, 2021               Page 18 of 43 
 
 outcome should be characterized as follows: 1 = Still present, 2 = Resolved with Sequelae, 
3 = Resolved without Sequelae, 4 = Lost to follow -up/Unknown, 5 = Death.  
Determination  of Severity .  The study coordinators  will make a determination of AE 
severity and provide a grade for each event according to the following criterion: Mild: 
Symptoms cause little discomfort, are easily tolerated, and do not significantly interfere with 
normal everyday activities . Moderate : Symptoms are uncomfortable and interfere with 
normal everyday activities. Severe : Symptoms cause significant impairment of everyday 
activities, incapacitation, or death  
Determination of Causality .  The LMP will make a determination the causality of 
each adverse event in relation to the study medication using the following criteri a: 1 = 
Definite , 2 = Probable , 3 = Possible , 4 = Remote , 5 = Definitely Not  
Process for Handling AEs .  At each visit and post -cessation call  (and via EMA, see 
sub-study below) , every participant will be asked to report on  health status  and adverse 
events.  In addition, study participants will be instructed verbally and in writing to contact [CONTACT_219179]’s life – 
though participants will be informed to call [ADDRESS_263388] study physicians  will address 
any medical problems that might arise (including working with each participant’s health care 
provider if needed) .   
AE Reporting Period.  All events not resolved or unrecovered by [CONTACT_5875] [ADDRESS_263389] ‘unknown ’ indicated for that event.  
 
Participant Payment  
Main Study and Sub-studies . Note that all s tudy participants  will receive 
compensation for  time and/or  travel  to the study sites as well as completing telephone visits 
during the treatment and f ollow -up study phases.  Participants in the  in-person cohort  will be 
paid $50 compensation for the screening/baseline  visit, $25 compensation for completing 
each of the weeks 2 and 13 telephone visits , $50 for completing the in -clinic visits at weeks 
4 and 8, and $100 for completing the in -clinic week  12 visit (total of $ 250), regardless of 
their smoking status . In addition, study participants will be compensated $ 50 to come into 
the study sites to complete electronic questionnaires and to provide a breath CO if they 
report 7 -day point prevalence abstinence at the 6-month follow -up call.  Given the attrition 
that occurs in many smoking cessation studies, especially those that assess OTC 
medications, compensation for key study visits is essential.   
Participants in the Remote Cohort  will be paid $50 combined  for screening/baseline 
visits 1 and 2 , $25 compensation for completing each of the weeks 2 and 13 visits , $50 for 
the visits at weeks 4 and 8, and $100 for completing the week 12 visit (total for $200), 
regardless of their smoking status. In addition, remote study participants will be 
compensated $50 electronic questionnaires and to provide a urine sample for cotinine 
analysis if they report 7 -day point prevalence abstinence at the 6 -month follow -up call.  
Compensation  will be paid to participants electronically.  
Participants in the sub -studies will also be compensated.  (1) EMA sub -study:  
Participants  (total N = 75, or 25/medication condition)  in the EMA sub -study will receive an 
additional $30 for completion of Week 1 EMA assessme nts and $40 for Week 2 EMA 
assessments. To encourage compliance with the EMA protocol  and decrease incidence of 
missing data , sub -study participants will receive an additional $10 in Weeks 1 and 2 if they 
complete 6 of 7 daily diaries,  and will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_263390] 3 scheduled prompts a day in each week. In total, EMA participants will 
Protocol #1R01DA044125  ver January 26, 2021               Page 19 of 43 
 
 be compensated an additional $70 to $110  at the Week 4 visit , depending on protocol 
compliance.   
 
EMA Sub -Study  
Methods.  We will randomly assign 25 people from each condition to participate in 
the EMA sub -study that lasts two weeks after the participants begin using varenicline, and 
they will be informed in the consent form at the Baseline/Screening visit that they may be 
asked to participate in the sub -study. We will use two types of EMA data assessments: (1) 
evening daily diaries to collect information on concrete behaviors (e.g., smoking and taking 
medication) that occurred that day, and (2) scheduled prompts to assess st ates (e.g. mood, 
craving, nausea) that fluctuate throughout the day  (Appendix 1 3). Data will be collected 
using scheduled  text messages linked to Qualtrics,  which provides  HIPPA -compliant data 
collection.  At the Baseline/Screening visit, the research assistant will enroll substudy 
participants in the text message EMA data collection and will train participants  how to 
respond to the scheduled prompts and the daily diary EMA surveys. The evening daily diary 
will include two brief questions on cigarette and va renicline pi[INVESTIGATOR_219146]. In 
addition to the daily diary, participants will also respond to up to five scheduled prompts 
throughout the day. The first scheduled prompt will occur at 9am , and will include five brief 
questions on vivid dreaming and sleep quality from the last night, momentary nausea, 
momentary mood, and momentary craving. After the first scheduled prompt of the day is 
completed, subsequent scheduled prompts will ask about momentary nausea, mood, and 
craving only. Participants will be prompted to complete scheduled surveys at waking and at 
every four hours. Scheduled prompts will expi[INVESTIGATOR_1312] 30 minutes after their scheduled time; 
evening daily diaries can be completed any time after their scheduled time until midnight.

EMA compliance and feasibility . The EMA scheduled prompts and daily diary  are 
extremely brief. Similar assessments from [CONTACT_219200]’s Moment Study took typi[INVESTIGATOR_219147] #1R01DA044125  ver January 26, 2021               Page 20 of 43 
 
 participants no more than 90 seconds to complete. To reduce missing data, participants 
who miss more than two sequential days of evening daily diaries or complete fewer than 
three scheduled prompts a day for two sequential days will receive encouragement t exts 
and calls from an RA to troubleshoot any problems with the app and encourage compliance.  
 
Definitions of Success  
FDA Abstinence Criteria . As indicated earlier, in all studies that assess medications for 
smoking cessation, the FDA typi[INVESTIGATOR_219148] 28 days of continuous 
abstinence, i .e.; not a single puff from a single cigarette.  The FDA does not require the 
‘clock’ to start at a consistent time point after study enrollment.  Thus, in many studies the 
‘clock’ on that 28 days begins two weeks after study medication has begun, while in other 
studies the ‘clock’ starts at a different time point.  In the current study, we will follow the 
protocol used in the varenicline pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518] .6,17-[ADDRESS_263392]  smoking  cessation  studies  ever conducted , the adverse  events  related  to 
varenicline  were  similar  to those  from the nicotine  patch , which  is already  approved  as an 
OTC  medication . 
However , we will monitor  very carefully  the screening  and ongoing  participation  of all 
participants . Study  participants  will only be allowed  to participate  and receive  medication  if 
the study  licensed  healthcare  provider  at each  site has approved  their participation  after 
reviewing  screening  documents . Regular  visits  as well as assessments  between  visits  will 
provide  updates  on potential  adverse  events , and any serious  events  will be assessed  
(including  for causality ) by [CONTACT_219180] (National Institute on Drug Abuse /NIH) within  24 hours .  
 We will also identify  an independent  safety -monitoring  panel  (comprised  of an MD 
and two additional  scientists  to be determined ) who receive  reports  once a year  on 
participant  safety , protocol  violations , medication  use, and any other  relevant  topi[INVESTIGATOR_219149] . The safety -monitoring  panel  will assess  all 
adverse  events , and will make  an independent  recommendation  on how study  staff should  
address  any concerns  that they have  raised .  Their  report  will be maintained  in the study  file 
notebook . 
 
E. DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS  
Data Collection, Management and Storage . All participant data will be collected 
and stored on the password protected iPad, and all iPads will be maintained in accordance 
with Good Clinical Practices and FDA regulations, e.g. in locked cabinets in locked rooms 
with acess restricted only to study personnel.  Once each month, data will be securely sent 
from LA Clinical Trials to the Arizona State University , where the data will be stored for 
analysis.  We are currently implementing a different study together, and the data transfer has 
worked well.   
Protocol #1R01DA044125  ver January 26, 2021               Page 21 of 43 
 
 Sample Size.  The primary analysis of this study is to compare the quit rates 
between groups. The sample size estimation is based on the results from Oncken et al.6 the 
quit rates at 12 weeks for 0.5, 1.0 mg b.i.d.  titrated groups and control group  are 
approximately 45%, 60% and 15% . In an OTC setting, we assume the rates would reduce 
by [CONTACT_2016]. Therefore, 23%, 30% and 8% are used to determine the sample size. Since we are 
interested in comparing the two active treatment arms with the control arm, to control for the 
overall type I error rate, the Bonferroni adjustment is applied: for each comparis on, the type 
I error is 0.025. With [ADDRESS_263393] 80% power to detect a 
difference of 23% vs. 8% (0.5mg vs. control)  by [CONTACT_219181] -square test . Even though a smaller 
sample size is required to detect a difference of 30% vs.  8% (1.0mg b.i.d. vs. control), we 
plan to enroll equal number of participants for each arm .  
For the EMA component of the study , we anticipate  the primary outcomes for each 
treatment condition in the EMA sub group  will not be statistically different from the non -EMA 
sample and plan to analyze the primary outcomes based on the combined sample . 
However, the data collected will provide information t o quantify the longitudinal within 
subject association. In particular, we hypothesize that the severity of side effect will increase 
in the first [ADDRESS_263394] at day 5 
is three times the odds at day 1. Based on our simulations  (type I error 0.05, 5 time points, 
and intra -class correlation 0. 3), with [ADDRESS_263395] 80% power 
to detect an odds ratio of 3.  
Data Sharing Plan . The information that we will collect includes medically -related 
information that is protected and must remain confidential, so all standard methods to 
protect participant confidentiality will be employed , including maintaining information in 
password protected encrypted databases to reduce the risk of a data breach . Shared data 
across the two study sites will likewise be password protected and encrypted. After study 
completion, a ny outside requests for data will require a data sharing agr eement that assures 
the following: (1) all data must be maintained in a secure fashion using appropriate 
technology, (2) commitment to use the data only for the research purposes requested, and 
(3) all shared data must either be destroyed or returned, incl uding written assurances to that 
effect.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan   
Main study .  The participation flow will be reported following CONSORT guidelines. 
Intention to treat analysis will be applied for all statistical analyses . The data collected from 
the study will be summarized by [CONTACT_219182] (1mg b.i.d. , .5mg b.i.d.  and placebo) and by [CONTACT_219183] (yes/no). The 
primary analysis will include estimating and comparing the quit rates between treatment 
arms. We will fit a logistic regression to model the probability of smoking ces sation at [ADDRESS_263396] e comparisons. The point estimate of quit rate and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for each treatment condition will be reported. If the interaction term 
is significant , we will conduct the comparisons in EMA and non -EMA subgroup s. A similar 
approach will be applied to the analysis of adherence and adverse event s. These two 
outcome variables can be analyzed as a dichotomous (yes/no) or count variable (pi[INVESTIGATOR_219150] s), and the logistic regression and Poisson regression will be 
used to e valuate whether group differences occur.  In the secondary analysi s, to evaluate 
Protocol #1R01DA044125  ver January 26, [ADDRESS_263397] of participant characteristics on the study outcomes, we will fit multivariable 
logistic or Poisson regression models. The odds ratio (from logistic regression) and ratio or 
percent change (from Poisson regression) will be reported to quantify t he association.  
In addition to evaluting the primary and secondary outcomes at the end of treatment 
(12 week), the trend over time between the initiation of treatment and at the end of the 
follow up period is also of interest. We will implement generalized linear mixed model 
(GLMM) with random in tercept to accou nt for the clustering effect (multiple visits clustered 
within each participant).32,[ADDRESS_263398] rad omization.  We intend to 
use two -level GLMMs, and will perform exploratory analysis using 3 -level GLMMs (visits 
clustered within participants, and participants clustered within sites [CA, AZ]) , as we 
anticipate the variability from sites would be negligible.  
Analysis of the Remote Cohort .  We will assess the in -person and remote cohort 
data via separate analyses, but because the fundamental study design in the same for both, 
if the outcomes of the separate analyses suggest similar outcomes, we might combine the  
results of both groups int o a single analysis.  
 EMA Statistical Analysis Plan .  Our approach to an alyzing EMA data is based on 
published approaches32,[ADDRESS_263399], multiple levels of nesting (i.e., 
observations within weeks within subjects), multiple subject random effects, modeling of 
between -subjects (BS) a nd within -subjects (WS) variance as a function of time-invariant 
covariates  (e.g. treatment assignment, gender, or nicotine dependence) , and extension to 
non-normal outcomes (i.e., dichotomous, ordinal, counts). Our primary approach will be a 
three -level m ixed model treating observations (level 1) within days  (level 2) within subjects 
(level 3). Additionally, w e will employ a time -varying effect model (TVEM )[ADDRESS_263400] below.  
  Our proposed EMA design allows for  examination of  multiple within -person , 
longitudinal associations between medication use, side effects, smoking , and craving, thus 
identifying the mechanisms driving smoking cessation when varenicline is used OTC . (1) 
The role of time on side effects : H1: Average ratings of day -level side effect severity (e.g. 
nausea, sleep disturbance, vivid dreams) will increase in the first week  of varenicline use. 
H2: Average within -person change in side effects will be greatest for those in the 1mg b.i.d 
condition.  (2) The role of side effects on medication adherence : H3: Average ratings of day -
level side effect severity will predict the odds of day -level medication adherence . (3) The 
role of medication adherence on momentary craving and smoking: H4: Day -level medication 
adherence will predict the day -level odds of smoking, mediated by [CONTACT_219184] -
person. H5: Day -level medication adherence will predict day -level craving similarly for  those 
in the 1 mg b.i.d and 0.5 b.i.d.  conditions , but not the placebo condition .

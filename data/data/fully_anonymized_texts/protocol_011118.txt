If you are selected to participate, you will live at the [LOCATION_006] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574892]. During your stay, you will 
participate in [ADDRESS_754642] visitors. 
 
WHAT WILL YOU BE ASKED TO DO? 
If you agree to be in the study, we will ask you to do the following things: 
1. Once you are medically cleared for the study, you will live at the [LOCATION_006] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_574893] 1 month. You will be 
transported by [CONTACT_574899]. You will stay at the Straus Facility 
for approximately 8 hrs on session days. Once session is completed, you will be transported back to the [LOCATION_006] 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
2. You will need to follow the inpatient unit rules for the duration of your stay. If you do not follow the rules, you 
will be discharged from the study – you will not receive a payment bonus if you are discharged for breaking rules. 
Some examples of these rules are: 
- You will not be allowed to have any visitors, but you will be able to make phone calls 
- You will be allowed to smoke cigarettes, but only under supervision of the CCTS nursing staff 
- No sexual behavior or sexual intercourse for the duration of the study 
- No drug or alcohol use; you cannot use any drugs that are not given to you as part of the study 
3. After you are admitted to the inpatient unit, we will show you the session room where testing will take place. 
We will teach you how to use the computer and show you the kinds of questions you will be asked and tasks you 
will need to complete. You will have plenty of time to ask questions about how to perform any of the tasks. 
We will teach you how to use the vaporizer (using placebo marijuana) to make sure that you are comfortable with 
the dose administration procedures. You will have plenty of time to practice before the sessions begin. 
4. There are a total of 11 sessions. The two sessions are qualification sessions – these sessions help us 
determine if you will qualify for the rest of the study. If you qualify, you will complete 9 experimental sessions. 
5. During the qualification sessions, you will receive an intranasal dose (a snorted drug) and a vaporized dose. 
The powder will contain an opi[INVESTIGATOR_162257] (for example: hydromorphone, oxycodone, morphine, or hydrocodone) or 
placebo (an inactive substance). The vaporized dose will contain active marijuana or placebo. Each of these 
qualification sessions will last approximately [ADDRESS_754643] of the study. [ZIP_CODE]

7. During each of the 9 sessions, you will receive two doses: vaporized marijuana and an intranasal opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533]. 
The marijuana dose will contain active marijuana or placebo. You will vaporize the dose according to our 
instructions. If you are not able to follow our instructions, you will be discharged. 
8. During each session, you will also receive an intranasal drug dose that contains an active dose of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] 
(for example: hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone) or placebo (a blank/inactive dose). We 
will ask you to snort the powder through a straw. 
9. During sessions, we will measure how you respond to each test drug by [CONTACT_574900], 
blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation, pupil diameter, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. We will also ask you 
questions about how you are feeling. For example, we may ask you if you are feeling high, if you like the drug 
effects or if you are feeling sick. We will also ask you to complete tasks that measure your coordination, have you 
estimate time intervals, and look at blinking lights to test your eyes – this test will not harm your vision. Each 
session will last approximately [ADDRESS_754644] your arm into a cooler of cold water. You will let us know when the cold sensation 
begins to hurt; you will remove your arm when you can no longer tolerate the cold water. This test will not injure 
your skin or cause frostbite. You will also answer some questions about the cold sensation and how you are 
feeling. 
10. During session, you may engage in activities such as reading, as long as these activities do not interfere with 
the study or any of the scheduled tasks or questionnaires. 
11. On days when you are not in session, you will be asked to fill out several questionnaires each day. For 
example, we will ask you about how you feel, whether you feel tired or have an upset stomach. The nurses will 
measure your vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) several times every day. You will also give breath and 
urine samples every day, which will be tested for drugs and alcohol; women will be tested for pregnancy. Use of 
drugs or alcohol that are not given to you as part of the study is forbidden and will result in your dismissal from the 
study. 
12. If you are female, you will be tested regularly to see if you are pregnant. If the test is positive, you will be 
notified, discharged from the study and referred for treatment. If you become pregnant at any time during the 
study (during screening, during the study, in the time between study discharge and your follow-up appointment, 
anytime in the [ADDRESS_754645] the study), you will need to notify the study investigator ([CONTACT_197031]) or 
the study physician ([CONTACT_130907]) as soon as possible: Shanna Babalonis, Ph.D. ([PHONE_11921]; Michelle

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS? 
The risks and discomforts of this study are related primarily to the drugs given to you and the experimental procedures. 
We have carefully selected the doses to minimize the risk of serious side effects. 
The likely risks of receiving marijuana include feeling high/intoxicated, euphoria, increased hunger and thirst, perceptual 
changes, anxiousness, panic-like reaction, lightheadedness/dizziness, performance impairment, drowsiness, orthostatic 
hypotension, resting increases or decreases in blood pressure, increased heart rate, red/bloodshot eyes, dry mouth, 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], concentration difficulties, faintness, restlessness, confusion, loss of coordination, shakiness, stomach upset, 
headache, paleness, flushing, sweating, slurred speech, and fatigue. There is also a chance that marijuana could cause a 
lung infection due to microbes on the plant – we have taken precautions to decrease these chances of this happening. 
The likely risks of receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_574894], stimulation, restlessness, a feeling of well being, 
talkativeness, itchiness, nausea, vomiting, decreased breathing, headache, constipation, dry mouth, sweating, 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], drowsiness, and light-headedness. The risks of decreased breathing after administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_574895]. We have carefully selected the doses to minimize the chance of 
decreased breathing. 
During this study, you will be snorting powder through a straw. Snorting drugs can irritate the nasal tissue and 
potentially give you a nosebleed. You have experience with snorting opi[INVESTIGATOR_574896]. 
We will watch you carefully throughout your participation to minimize the chance of any serious reactions. 
We do not have any plans to draw your blood after the screening is completed. However, if you were to get sick or hurt 
during the study, we may need to conduct these tests. There are risks related to blood draws include soreness, bruising, 
pain, infection, possible fainting, and bleeding. It is possible that we will have to try more than once to draw blood. 
An ECG is painless; however, the electrodes may feel cold when first applied. In rare cases, some people may develop a 
rash or irritation where the patches were placed. 
 
Exposure to drugs may have harmful effects on a fetus or a newborn, and you will not be allowed to participate in the 
study if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding during the study, or if you cannot use an 
appropriate contraception method. 
We will make every effort to keep private all research records that identify you to the extent allowed by [CONTACT_2371]. However, 
there is a risk that a breach in confidentiality may occur. If this occurs, it may cause problems such as embarrassment and 
emotional stress. 
There is always a chance that any medical treatment can harm you. The research medications/treatments/procedures in 
this study are no different. In addition to risks described in this document, you may experience a previously unknown risk 
or side effect. We will do everything we can to keep you from being harmed. 
WILL YOU BENEFIT FROM TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY? 
You will not get any personal benefit from taking part in this study. However, if you take part in this study, you may 
help us learn more about the effects of marijuana and opi[INVESTIGATOR_574897]. [ZIP_CODE]

Interventions to increase physical activity have been shown to relieve fatigue in patients receiving chemotherapy, but no studies have tested a physical activity intervention to improve fatigue in young adults receiving chemotherapy.  Young adults with cancer acknowledge unmet needs for information and interventions related to physical activity, and they have concerns about how and when to return to physical activity during treatment.    Primary Objectives To determine the impact of a physical activity intervention on the self-management process variables of self-efficacy and self-regulation and their relationships to physical activity and fatigue severity.

MCW Protocol No: 13 Version No.6 IND No.:   Version Date: 8/16/17 1 SPECIFIC AIMS Over 70,000 adolescents and young adults (AYAs) between the ages of [ADDRESS_350081] distressing symptoms and a “major and disabling problem” for AYAs with cancer.2 Persistent fatigue is implicated as one cause for the poor physical and emotional health-related quality of life outcomes in this young group of patients.3     Like many patients, AYAs receiving chemotherapy get caught in a cycle of cancer-related fatigue, which leads to decreased physical activity (PA), which contributes to deconditioning and more fatigue.[ADDRESS_350082] a lifetime, requiring the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits.  The Individual and Family Self-Management Theory (IFSMT) outlines factors related to the individual’s knowledge and beliefs, self-efficacy and self-regulation, which impact the self-management process to improve outcomes.18 Self-efficacy is a predictive factor for participating in PA, and promoting AYAs’ self-efficacy for PA needs to be explored as a strategy to improve self-management of fatigue.19   The purpose of this research is to study a 12-week PA intervention to improve self-management of fatigue in AYAs receiving chemotherapy. The intervention will include components of education, negotiated collaboration to set individual PA goals during chemotherapy cycles, and tools for self-monitoring PA.  The aims of this study are:  1. To determine the impact of the PA intervention on the self-management process variables of self-efficacy and self-regulation and their relationships to PA and fatigue severity. 2. To determine the preliminary efficacy of the PA intervention on outcomes of PA and fatigue severity. 
   
MCW Protocol No: 14 Version No.6 IND No.:   Version Date: 8/16/17 2 BACKGROUND Fatigue in Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) with Cancer  Fatigue is one of the most prevalent and severe symptoms in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer.2 Defined as “a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity”20 (p1), cancer-related fatigue causes significant distress for AYAs and interferes with physical activities, social function, and mood.2, [ADDRESS_350083] shown greater symptom severity, including fatigue, than children and older patients. 23, 24 The higher level of fatigue in AYAs may be due to their accelerated physical and cognitive growth, hormone-related changes, as well as their involvement in multiple activities of this developmental period (school, work, relationships, and parenting).[ADDRESS_350084] concerns about safety and physical limitations and how/when to return to exercise post-treatment.9 AYAs with cancer cite barriers to PA similar to a healthy comparison group, such as lack of energy, lack of self-discipline, lack of skills, and no companions, but AYA cancer survivors may be less likely to cite ‘lack of time’ as a significant barrier.9,17  An effective PA intervention, implemented early in the 
   
MCW Protocol No: 15 Version No.6 IND No.:   Version Date: 8/16/17 chemotherapy treatment process, is needed to prevent the cycle of fatigue and inactivity in AYAs that is associated with negative outcomes. Theoretical Framework The Individual and Family Self-Management Theory (IFSMT) will be used as a framework for this study.18 This theory proposes three inter-related dimensions of context, process, and outcomes related to individuals’ self-management behaviors.  Contextual factors refer to the individual and family, the individual’s health status, and the physical and social environment which influence self-management.  The process dimension includes knowledge and beliefs, behavior-specific self-efficacy and self-regulation, and social facilitation.  Outcome variables may be proximal, such as condition-specific self-management behaviors, and/or distal, such as quality of life or health care costs.    The IFSMT acknowledges the specific developmental and cancer-related needs of AYAs that influence their self-management behaviors.   The intervention in this study (The “Step-Up” Study) contains three components which target the self-management process:  1) education about the benefits of PA and symptom management to improve AYAs’ knowledge and beliefs and self-efficacy for PA, 2) resources to increase AYAs’ use of self-regulation behaviors related to PA, and 3) ongoing negotiated collaboration with a facilitator to promote PA. The impact of the intervention on the proximal outcome of engagement in PA and on the distal outcome of fatigue severity will be measured.  (Figure 1).   Innovation This study is focused on PA research with the understudied group of AYAs with cancer.  It is the first study to apply the IFSMT as a framework to identify effective interventions to help AYAs increase their PA as a strategy to manage fatigue, examining whether improved self-efficacy and self-regulation for PA as well as social facilitation will result in desired behavior changes.  The intervention will be offered to AYAs who are currently receiving treatment and will be integrated into their regularly scheduled visits for chemotherapy administration, an important step to translate this evidence-based intervention into practice settings. Finally, since the intervention focuses on PA as a self-management behavior, the study will provide evidence about the impact of a less intensive and less expensive approach to improving PA, which may be a more relevant, meaningful, and feasible PA intervention for all AYAs with cancer.     Preliminary work  The multidisciplinary team comprises a unique combination of expertise in AYA oncology and PA research.  [CONTACT_49544] is an oncology nurse researcher with over 30 years of clinical oncology experience.  She has conducted previous studies that described patterns of fatigue during chemotherapy cycles and the negative effects of symptoms such as fatigue and sleep-wake disturbances on the daily activities and quality of life of AYAs receiving chemotherapy.22, 26, 39 She has also demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of

MCW Protocol No: 17 Version No.6 IND No.:   Version Date: 8/16/17 Randomization Patients will be randomized into two groups (intervention and usual care) using the Excel ‘RAND’ function to create a randomization chart forcing 38 into the intervention arm and 37 into the usual care arm.   Study Timeline Primary Completion The study will reach primary completion 19 months from the time the study opens to accrual. Study Completion The study will reach study completion 22 months from the time the study opens to accrual. 4. PATIENT SELECTION Inclusion Criteria Patients eligible for the study will be: 1) between the ages of 18 and 39 years of age;1  2) have a diagnosis of cancer;  3) are within the first two months of a chemotherapy regimen that will last at least another 3  months;  4) are ambulatory without assistance;  5) have written consent from their physician to participate;  6) have the ability to understand English;  7) have access to a computer and the Internet.    The goal of this study is to deliver the intervention as early in the treatment period as possible, but we recognize that recruiting and completing baseline measures before chemotherapy begins may be a burden to patients and a barrier to recruitment.  The lower age limit for AYAs will be set at [ADDRESS_350086] any of these contraindications to physical activity.   5. STUDY PROCEDURES Recruitment Process A member of the study team will screen clinic schedules at FH/MCW Cancer Center and clinic schedules in the Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Clinic to identify every AYA who meets the inclusion criteria.  Clinic staff will ask eligible patients if they are willing to speak 
   
MCW Protocol No: 18 Version No.6 IND No.:   Version Date: 8/16/17 with a member of the study team about the study. Eligible participants will be given time - over days, if necessary and possible - to consider study participation after hearing the details of the study. A member of the study team will complete the informed consent process with AYAs using an open exchange, reading through the informed consent document together, and allowing for assessment of comprehension and discussion of questions and concerns.  A member of the study team will obtain written consent from the patient’s primary provider to indicate the patients do not have any contraindications to physical activity.   A signed informed consent form copy will be given to the subject and a copy will be filed in the medical record. The original will be kept on file with the study records.  All patients who are consented will be registered in OnCore®, the MCW Cancer Center Clinical Trial Management System. The system is password protected and meets HIPAA requirements.  Study Procedures 1.  Visit 1 Enrollment Following informed consent, a study team member will administer baseline surveys to all participants.  Participants will receive instructions about wearing an accelerometer (Actigraph) for 1 week and how to return the accelerometer (Actigraph).  Participants will be asked for their preferred method of contact (email or phone call) to be reminded to return the accelerometer after one week of wear.  A study team member will contact [CONTACT_286915]-week period and remind them to return the accelerometer promptly in the mailing envelope that was provided.   Participants will be randomized to the intervention group or the usual care group.   2.  Visit 2 (next regularly scheduled visit for chemotherapy) Intervention group participants will meet with the facilitator, who will provide initial education about the benefits of physical activity and strategies to overcome barriers to physical activity, help the participants to set physical activity goals based on ability and preferences, and educate the participant on using a physical activity tracker (Fitbit Flex).   Usual care group participants will meet with the facilitator who will provide initial information to participants about the study and a published flyer about general guidelines for physical activity during treatment.   3.  Visits 3, 4, 5, 6 (next regularly scheduled visits for chemotherapy – at intervals of approximately 3 weeks but may range from every 2-4 weeks based on chemotherapy schedule) Intervention group participants will meet with the facilitator who will deliver a 30 minute intervention:  1) review physical activity summary over the past weeks, 2) identify barriers and discuss strategies to overcome barriers to physical activity, and 3) revise physical activity goals as needed.  The facilitator will record physical activity data from the tracking device (Fitbit Flex), discussion notes about the barriers and strategies, and physical activity 
   
MCW Protocol No: 19 Version No.6 IND No.:   Version Date: 8/16/[ADDRESS_350087]-study surveys and will receive instructions about wearing an accelerometer (Actigraph) for 1 week and how to return the accelerometer (Actigraph).  A study team member will contact [CONTACT_286915]-week period and remind them to return the accelerometer promptly in the mailing envelope that was provided.   Following completion of the study, a member of the study team will ensure completion and return of accelerometer (Actigraph) use by [CONTACT_55473]. All participants will receive $[ADDRESS_350088]-study survey to evaluate components of the intervention and be invited to keep the physical activity tracker (Fitbit Flex).   6.  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Sample Size In an a priori power analysis using a mediation model that includes 4 predictors (intervention variable, self-efficacy, self-regulation, and PA), a total sample of 68 participants (34 in each group) would be needed to detect a medium-sized effect at a 0.10 significance level with 80% power.  The power analysis was completed by [CONTACT_286916] (http://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calculator.aspx?id=1) based on the above information.  Physicians at FH/MCW and CHW saw approximately 300 AYAs with a new cancer diagnosis in 2012, and about half of those AYAs received chemotherapy.  Assuming a 50% enrollment rate and 10% attrition, 75 AYAs will be recruited from these sites for a final sample of 68.  Data Management and Analysis Questionnaire data will be collected electronically using REDcap surveys, and accelerometer (Actigraph) data will be analyzed using respective software.  For the intervention group, weekly PA data will be transcribed from the PA tracker (Fitbit Flex) dashboard to REDcap files at each visit.  All REDcap data will be exported to SPSS for analysis.  Descriptive statistics will be used to describe and summarize the context variables related to the sample.  Variables with significant patterns of variation will be explored as potential covariates. Missing values will be identified and reviewed for patterns of missingness, and the percentage of missing data will be calculated. If missing data are less than 5%, pairwise deletion will be used in data analysis, meaning all available cases will be used. If missing data are greater than or equal to 5%, Little’s Chi-square test will be used to check if data are missing at random. If missing at random is assumed, multiple imputation method will be used. Field notes from sessions with the facilitator related to barriers and self-management strategies as well as notes from post-study debriefing interviews will be recorded and organized by [CONTACT_286917].    
   
MCW Protocol No: 20 Version No.6 IND No.:   Version Date: 8/16/17 After all study queries and analyses are completed, the data/PHI will not be destroyed but will be archived in a secure long-term storage site in order to keep an accurate record of screened and enrolled subjects for the sponsor and potential audit purposes only specific for this study. Data/PHI would not be destroyed until permission is granted by [CONTACT_286918].  Statistical Analyses Specific Aim 1: To determine the impact of the PA intervention on the self-management process variables of self-efficacy and self-regulation, data analysis will examine differences in baseline and post-study measures of self-efficacy and self-regulation for each group.  Group differences will be compared using t-tests to determine the effect of the intervention on these process variables.  A mediation model will be used to describe the relationships of self-management process variables (self-efficacy and self-regulation) to PA (steps/day by [CONTACT_6317]) and fatigue severity where self-efficacy and self-regulation are the main mediators of the intervention, PA is the second mediator, and fatigue severity is the dependent variable. The direct and indirect effect of treatment on PA and fatigue severity will be determined by [CONTACT_286919]:45, 46  Step 1. The regression of the fatigue severity on the intervention variable, ignoring the mediators, is significant. Step 2: The regression of the main mediators on the intervention variable  is significant.  Step 3: The regression of the second mediator (PA) on the main mediators (self-efficacy and self-regulation), controlling for the intervention, is significant.  Step 4: The regression of the fatigue severity on the second mediator (PA), controlling for the main mediators (self-efficacy and self-regulation) and the intervention, is significant.   Step 5:  The regression of the fatigue severity on the intervention, controlling for the mediators, is non-significant and nearly-zero.  In this case, the effect of intervention on fatigue severity is indirect through the mediators.  If regression of the fatigue severity on the intervention, controlling for the mediators, is still significant, then the effect of treatment on fatigue severity is direct.    From the regression models, unstandardized regression coefficients and their standard errors will be calculated for the associations between the intervention variable and the mediators as well as between the fatigue severity and the mediators. The Sobel test will be used to test if the mediation effect is statistically significant.45-49 Data from field notes from the intervention group participants will be analyzed using qualitative, inductive content analysis procedures to identify themes related to self-efficacy and self-regulation skills.  Specific Aim 2: To determine the preliminary efficacy of the PA intervention on outcome variables of PA (steps/day by [CONTACT_6317]) and fatigue severity, data analysis will examine differences in baseline and post-study measures of PA (steps/day by [CONTACT_6317]) and fatigue severity (PROMIS-29 and PROMIS Fatigue scores) for each group.   Group differences will then be compared using t-tests to detect the effect of the PA intervention on these outcomes.  Direct and indirect effect of the intervention on fatigue severity will be studied using the mediation model discussed in Aim 1.  Quantitative data about the fidelity of the intervention will be used to estimate the dose of the delivered intervention for each participant and to explore whether there was a dosage effect on the outcomes.  7.

MCW Protocol No: 21 Version No.6 IND No.:   Version Date: 8/16/[ADDRESS_350089].  The Safety Monitoring Committee includes the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_286890] (M. Fendrich), Pi[INVESTIGATOR_286891]/Content Expert (C. Kovach), and two members independent of the P20 Center (C. Huang, Biostatistician, and A. Harley, Community and Behavioral Health Promotion).  The P20 Center Director (R. Schiffman) is responsible for submitting necessary reports to NINR.    b.  Procedures 1.  Monitoring study safety.  The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_286892] (J. Erickson) will meet bi-weekly with the study team to review study enrollment, compliance with IRB requirements, including informed consent, verification of source documents, and compliance with study procedures.  The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_286893] P20 Center Pi[INVESTIGATOR_286894]-weekly meetings with the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_286895].  At the point when 10% of the participants are enrolled and at random intervals throughout the duration of the study, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_286896].  The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_286897].   2.  Minimizing research-associated risk. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_286898], but potential risks are that participants may experience psychological discomfort or distress when reflecting upon their personal experiences about cancer and cancer-related symptoms and/or physical discomfort, distress, or injury related to following a low-intensity physical activity (PA) plan.  The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_286892] (J. Erickson) will investigate any research-associated risks that are identified by [CONTACT_286920] P20 Center Principal Investigator (R. Schiffman) or the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_286890] (M. Fendrich) so that these concerns can be addressed.    The following actions will be outlined in the study procedures to protect against risks:   Psychological discomfort or distress. The facilitator and other members of the study team will be educated about how to recognize emotional distress and to make every effort to provide psychosocial support when emotional distress is evident. In the event that any participant demonstrates or self-reports a high level of distress, a member of the study team will conduct a further assessment. With the participant’s consent, the study team may inform the participant’s health care provider of the emotional distress in order to make adjustments to the care plan or suggest referrals for specialized care. No information will be disclosed to another party without the participant’s consent unless there is imminent danger to the participant or others.  Physical discomfort, distress, or injury related to following a low-intensity physical activity (PA) plan.  According to the American College of Sports Medicine, PA is safe and beneficial for patients during cancer treatment, and baseline exercise-testing is not required for patients to participate in low- to moderate-intensity PA, such as walking or resistance training. We will exclude patients who have contraindications to PA, which may include symptoms of uncontrolled cardiopulmonary disease, uncontrolled neurological disease, delayed wound healing from surgery, a high risk of bone fracture, or preexisting peripheral neuropathy, and we will obtain written approval from the 
   
MCW Protocol No: 22 Version No.6 IND No.:   Version Date: 8/16/17 patient’s physician to indicate none of these conditions apply. Patients will receive information from the facilitator about PA safety at the start of the study and will be advised to set PA goals based on their baseline PA level and to respect their own physical limitations. Participants will be reminded to complete ‘pre-exercise’ screening every day, and they will be advised not to engage in PA if they have any of the following conditions: 1) heart palpi[INVESTIGATOR_286899]; 2) fever greater than 38o C; 3) shortness of breath at rest; 4) new bruises or ongoing bleeding; 5) uncontrolled pain or nausea; 6) dizziness. They will be advised not to resume PA until these conditions resolve, and they should contact [CONTACT_286921]/or severe. PA studies have been safely carried out with patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy who have platelet values as low as 20,000/mm3 and leucocytes < 1.0X109/L, and no studies have shown PA complications related to bleeding or infection.  At each visit, the facilitator will discuss PA safety with each participant, explore any concerns about physical discomfort or distress that may be related to PA, and any new symptoms that may be a contraindication to PA. The facilitator will consult with the patient’s care providers if there are any concerns about continuing the PA study.  3.  Protecting confidentiality of participant data.  Only study team members will have access to participant data. Participant data will be listed using a study ID number, and identifiable personal health information (PHI) will be stored separately from other study data. Data from surveys, accelerometers (Actigraphs), and PA trackers (Fitbits) and from facilitation and interview sessions will be stored on password-protected computers with access limited to study personnel.

The study team will review study activities and participant involvement at each bi-weekly team meeting with attention to identification of any unexpected events or problems.  Should an adverse event or unanticipated problem occur, the project team will immediately contact [CONTACT_76017][INVESTIGATOR_286892] (J. Erickson), who will contact [CONTACT_941] P20 Center Principal Investigator (R. Schiffman). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_286903], including the plan to address the problem.  d.  Multi-site Studies.  This is not a multi-site study.    e.  External Factors.  Before each quarterly meeting with the P20 DSM Team, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_286892] (J. Erickson) and Project Co-Investigators (J. Charlson and M. Stolley) will review any changes in practice or policy at Froedtert Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/MCW Cancer Center that would affect this study.  They will also review any relevant new literature or research that would impact the safety of the participants or ethics of the study.

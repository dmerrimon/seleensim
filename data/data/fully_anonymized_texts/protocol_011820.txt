Study Protocol 
Milk in Life Conditions (MiLC) Trial 
Background and Objective: Women use a wide range of practices for pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_249462]  (1-4). 
The effects of these practices on the bacterial composition of the milk are unclear.  The objective 
of the MiLC trial was to test the effect of women’s o wn pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_249463].  
Study Design: The MiLC trial will be a randomized, controlled cross -over trial of [ADDRESS_303357] pump 
set-ups: mother’s own and sterile. Mother’s own pump set-ups will consist of the mother’s own 
electric pump and own collection kits, cleaned at home using her usual practices. Sterile pump 
set-ups will consist of a multi-user electric pump (Medela Symphony) and a sterile collection kit. 
The pump each woman will use first will be randomized using stratified randomization based on 
infant feeding status (human milk only v. human milk and complementary foods).  
Recruitment: We will recruit women in Ithaca, NY and the surrounding area. Participants will 
be recruited on a continuous basis through flyer advertisements at pediatric clinics, day -care 
centers, graduate-student housing at Cornell University, and Ithaca College, in WIC offices, and 
in cafes and local children’s boutiques. Posters will briefly state the purpose of the study and that 
participation is voluntary and anonymous. We will also use snowball, or word -of-mouth, 
sampling, whereby [CONTACT_249470]. We 
will also advertise by [CONTACT_72683]-of-mouth at La Leche League meetings.  Written informed consent 
will be obtained according to the study protocol approved by [CONTACT_249471] (Unique Protocol ID: IRB #: [PHONE_5233]). 
 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria: We will include lactating women over the age of 18 years who: i)  
self-report as healthy, ii) pump their milk with an electric pump, iii) are confident of their ability 
to donate [ADDRESS_303358] during each of two consecutive pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_249464] 3 hours ± 30 minutes apart and between 0700-1100 hours, iv) are able to 
store their donated milk at home for 30 days, v) describe their infants as being healthy, and vi) 
have infants who do not consume formula or only consume formula epi[INVESTIGATOR_249465]-feeding occurred > 2 weeks before the day their mothers pump for this 
study. We will exclude women who: i) are not confident of their ability donate [ADDRESS_303359] during each of two consecutive pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_119696], 3 hours ± 30 minutes apart and 
between the hours of 0700-1100 hours, ii) have an infant who has consumed formula in the past 
2 weeks, iii) have current indication of breast infection (e.g., breast pain, discomfort, lumps, 
mastitis with fever, red streaks, or hard red portions of the breast), iv) have breast pain that the 
woman does not consider “normal” for lactation/breastfeeding, and v) self -reports that she or her 
infant showed signs/symptoms of acute Illness in the past 7 days including: fever (rectal or 
temporal temperature ≥99.5 ºF), dark green nasal discharge, diarrhea (abrupt onset of 3 or more 
excessively “loose” stools in one day), vomiting (where infant vomiting is not associated with 
feeding), or severe cough. 
 
Sample Collection: Lactating women (n=50) will donate [ADDRESS_303360] during each pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_143523]. Women will pump once with

3 their own pumps and bottles and once with the sterile pump and sterile bottles  (provided by [CONTACT_5055]). Women will be randomized to which pump  they will use first. Randomization 
will be done using stratified randomization by [CONTACT_249472] (human milk only vs. human milk and complementary foods). All pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_249466]' homes  between 
[ADDRESS_303361] begin 3 hours ± [ADDRESS_303362] pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_143523] (e.g. the first pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_249467] 7:30 am and the second 
at 10:30 am). Women will elect from which breast they donate their milk and that breast will be 
used for both pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_119696]. Women will be asked not to nurse from or pump that breast 
during the [ADDRESS_303363] pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_249468] (a total of ~5.5 hours). From the milk produced during each pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_143523] (which 
could be up to ~6 oz), we will collect 1 oz using a sterile, plastic syringe. Women will keep  the 
remaining volume of milk. Each ounce of milk collected will be separated  into 5 sterile 
containers that we will provide. Women will store donated milk at their home  until it is pi[INVESTIGATOR_249469] a researcher 2, 4, and 30 days after pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Bacterial Composition of Human Milk: The bacterial content of milk will be assessed via 
aerobic culturing and high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene from DNA 
extracted from the milk. Total aerobic bacterial counts will be reported as colony -forming unit 
(CFU)/mL estimated using standard methods. Sequence data from 16S rRNA analysis will be reported as bacterial community richness and diversity using observed taxa (amplicon sequence 
variants) and the Shannon diversity index, respectively.  
 Sample size calculations: Inasmuch as the variability of our outcomes differs widely, we 
decided to base our sample size calculations on 16S rRNA data from our bacterial community 
analysis because these data are more variable than those from culture -related assays. However, 
there is not sufficient evidence on which to base sample size calculations. We are aware of one 
on-going multi-site study in which each site has 40 participants  (5). We have sufficient resources 
to analyze the milk of [ADDRESS_303364] culture -based 
investigations; thus, this will be our target sample size.  
 Outcomes: 
• Bacterial Community Richness: Richness is the total number of different bacterial taxa 
(amplicon sequence variants) detected in the sample. This metric will be assessed on data derived from high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene present in 
milk. 
• Bacterial Community Diversity: Bacterial community diversity will be assessed using 
the Shannon diversity index. The Shannon diversity index is a type of entropy measure and is a function of the distribution of the total number of organisms across all of the 
species. If S is the total number of species in the sample and p
i is the number of 
organisms in the i-th species divided by [CONTACT_249473], then Diversity = −Σ p
i log(p i). This metric will be assessed on data derived from high-throughput 
sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene present in milk. 
• Total Live Aerobic Bacterial Counts: Number of live total aerobic bacteria in milk 
assessed by [CONTACT_249474]. Reported as colony -forming 
units (CFU)/mL.

4 Statistical Analysis: Statistical analyses will be based on our primary hypothesis that the bacterial content of expressed human milk pumped with mothers’ own pump set-up differs from 
the bacterial content of expressed human milk pumped with a sterile pump set -up. To test this 
hypothesis, we will use linear mixed effects regression. Our 3 primary outcomes  (e.g., bacterial 
counts, observed taxa, and Shannon diversity index) will serve as response variables in separate 
models. For all models, the fixed effect of interest will be pump set-up (own v. sterile pump set-
up). In addition, models will  be adjusted for covariates relevant to our study design, namely 
infant feeding status (human milk feeding only v. human milk and complementary foods) and 
randomization schedule (which pump each woman used first).  For all models, the random effect 
will be participant ID to account for multiple observations per participant .

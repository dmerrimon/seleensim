Objective	Physical	Activity	Monitoring
Following	all	baseline	measurements,	each	participant	will	be	fitted	with	physical
activity	(inclinometer	and	tri-axial	accelerometer)	and	ambulatory	cardiovascular
monitors	(heart	rate	strap	and	ambulatory	blood	pressure	monitor)	to	wear	for	[ADDRESS_1154434],	research	grade	methods:	1)	inclinometer
(activPAL,	PAL	Technologies,	Glasgow)	and	2)	tri-axial	accelerometer	(GT3X-BT,
Actigraph,	Pensacola,	Fl).	These	two	measurements	have	been	validated	and	used
extensively	to	measure	physical	activity	patterns	in	a	free-living	environment	(127,

The	activPAL	will	be	affixed	to	the	right	thigh	using	a	transparent	adhesive	dressing
(Tegaderm,	3M)	for	7	days	to	measure	24-hour	activity,	posture	(sitting	or	standing),
and	steppi[INVESTIGATOR_831779].	Participants	will	be	asked	to	wear	the	ActivPAL	for
7	days	to	estimate	weekly,	habitual	activity.	The	participants	will	be	encouraged	to
wear	the	ActivPAL	monitor	for	24	hours	per	day	from	7	days	and	only	asked	to
remove	the	device	prior	to	swimming	and	placing	it	back	on	immediately	after.

periods	will	be	coded	as	sleep	and	will	be	removed	from	the	calculation	of	sedentary
time.	Self-reported	non-wear	will	also	be	removed	from	the	sedentary	time
calculation.	Further	data	reduction	will	estimate	time	spent	in	prolonged	bouts	of
sedentary	behavior	(e.g.,	<30	consecutive	minutes:	SED<30	and	≥30	consecutive
minutes:	SED≥30)	or	standing	(e.g.,	≥60	minutes)	and	averaged	across	all	valid
wear	days.	Averages	will	also	be	calculated	during	work	and	non-work	days.
The	Actigraph	GT3X-BT	will	be	worn	over	the	right	hip	using	an	elastic	belt	to
measure	pattern	and	intensity	of	activity	(light,	moderate,	or	vigorous)	for	7	days.
Each	participant	will	be	instructed	to	take	the	monitor	off	only	for	water	activities
(e.g.,	showering,	swimming).	They	will	also	be	asked	to	record	the	corresponding
times	of	monitor	removal	and	application	in	their	paper	diary	each	day.
Accelerometry	counts	will	be	calculated	as	sedentary	time,	light	activity,	or	moderate
to	vigorous	activity	using	previously	described	algorithms	across	all	valid	wear	time
as	well	as	for	work	time	and	non-work	time.	Data	will	be	collected	as	1-minute
epochs,	downloaded	using	ActiLife	software	(Actigraph,	Pensacola,	Fl)	and
considered	valid	if	data	is	collected	for	≥4	days	of	≥10	hours	per	day.	Wear	time	will
be	defined	as	24	hours	minus	non-wear	time,	defined	using	the	Choi	algorithm.
Daily	mean	activity	counts	(cpm)	and	duration	of	all	activity	intensity	categories
(minutes/day)	will	be	averaged	across	all	valid	wear	days.	Moderate	to	vigorous
physical	activity	will	be	derived	from	the	triaxial	vector	magnitude	data	using
Freedson	vector	magnitude	cutpoints.	Moderate	to	vigorous	physical	activity	will	be
further	separated	into	long	bouts	(≥10	consecutive	minutes	with	allowance	for	2
consecutive	minutes	below	the	100	cpm,	MVPA≥10)	and	then	short	bout	moderate
to	vigorous	physical	activity	(<10	minutes,	MVPA<10)	(129,	130).
Combining	activPAL	and	Actigraph	data,	we	will	calculate	time	spent	in	five	clinically
relevant	activity	categories:	SED≥30,	SED<30,	light	activity,	MVPA<10,	and
MVPA≥10.	These	categories	reflect	the	recent	expert	call	for	research	examining	the
health	impacts	of	light	physical	activity	and	prolonged	versus	sporadic	sedentary

24-hour	heart	rate	measurement
A	Bluetooth	enabled	HR	monitor	strap	(H7	Bluetooth,	Polar)	will	continuously
measure	HR	for	7	days	and	provide	a	measurement	of	average	24-hour	HR	for
every	day	during	the	7-day	period.	Each	participant	will	be	instructed	to	wear	the	HR
strap	directly	below	their	nipple	line	for	the	duration	of	the	7-day	monitoring	period,
only	removing	it	during	bathing	or	during	water	activities	(e.g.,	swimming).	Any	time
the	monitor	is	removed,	the	participants	will	be	instructed	to	record	the	time	and
reason	in	the	provided	paper	diary.	The	HR	monitor	will	be	paired	via	Bluetooth	with
the	Actigraph	accelerometer	upon	activation	so	that	the	continuously	measured	HR
data	at	a	beat	to	beat	resolution	of	1	millisecond	and	will	be	stored	on	the	Actigraph
device	throughout	the	monitoring	period.	HR	data	will	be	downloaded	as	interbeat
R-R	intervals	using	ActiLife	software	(Actigraph,	Pensacola,	Fl).	Average	24-hour
HR	will	be	calculated	for	all	wear	days	where	the	beginning	and	end	of	each	24-hour
day	is	defined	as	the	average	reported	wake-up	time	for	each	participant.	Average
24-hour	HR	will	then	be	calculated	for	work	days	or	non-work	days	separately.	
Heart	rate	variability	measurement
Nocturnal	heart	rate	variability	(HRV)	will	be	measured	on	every	night	of	the	7-day
monitoring	period	using	the	Bluetooth	HR	strap	described	above	to	examine
autonomic	function.	A	previous	systematic	review	concluded	that	telemetric-derived
measures	(Polar	heart	rate	monitor)	of	HRV	provide	a	valid	alternative	to
electrocardiogram	measurement.	Data	collection	will	be	done	at	a	sampling	beat	to
beat	resolution	of	1	millisecond.	HR	data	will	be	downloaded	as	interbeat	R-R
intervals	using	ActiLife	software	(Actigraph,	Pensacola,	Fl)	which	will	then	be
imported	into	Kubios	HRV	software	version	3.2	(Kubios	HRV	v.3.2,	Kubios,	Kuopio,
Eastern	Finland)	for	HRV	data	analysis.	The	entire	reported	sleep	duration	will	be
separated	into	valid	5-minute	periods.	Nocturnal	HRV	will	be	defined	in	two	ways.	1)
All	valid	5-minute	segments	will	be	averaged	across	the	whole	self-reported	nights

with	the	highest	R-R	intervals	(lowest	HR)	will	be	determined	for	each	sleep	interval
and	averaged.	Both	of	these	selection	methods	have	been	previously	used	to
evaluate	nocturnal	HRV.	For	each	sleep	interval	detected,	mean	HRV	values	will	be
determined	using	both	methods	and	averaged	across	the	night	for	each	work	day
and	non-work	day.	HRV	values	that	will	be	calculated	for	these	time	periods	are:	root

All	HRV	values	will	be	calculated	using	Kubios	HRV	software	version	3.2.
Ambulatory	blood	pressure	measurement
Each	participant	will	be	asked	to	wear	the	ambulatory	BP	monitor	(ABPM)	(Oscar	2,
SunTech	Medical,	Morrisville,	NC)	on	their	non-dominant	arm	for	24-hours	on	two
occasions	throughout	the	monitoring	period	(one	work	day	and	one	non-work	day).
The	participants	will	only	be	asked	to	wear	the	ABPM	on	two	days	during	the	7-day
monitoring	period	to	limit	participant	burden.	These	two	days	will	be	determined	with
the	participant	and	study	staff	on	the	day	of	the	baseline	assessment.	Ideally,	the
work	day	monitoring	will	be	done	with	one	work	day	prior	and	at	least	[ADDRESS_1154435]	(i.e.
ABPM	on	a	Wednesday	when	Tuesday	was	a	work	day	and	baseline	assessment
was	on	a	Monday).	Similarly,	the	non-work	day	monitoring	is	ideally	done	with	one
non-work	day	prior	and	at	least	48	hours	after	the	baseline	assessment	visit	(i.e.
ABPM	on	Sunday	if	Saturday	is	a	non-work	day	and	baseline	assessment	was	on	a
Monday).	Ambulatory	BP	will	be	measured	using	established	protocols	including
every	30	minutes	during	the	day	and	every	60	minutes	during	sleep	using	self-
reported	sleep	and	wake	times	(136).	Participants	will	be	given	the	ABPM	upon
completion	of	the	baseline	assessment	and	be	shown	how	to	properly	wear	the
monitor.	They	will	also	be	given	standardized	instructions	on	monitor	wear,	how	to
start/end	the	monitoring,	and	when	to	wear	the	monitor	(137).	The	participants	will
be	required	to	start	and	stop	the	monitor	on	their	prescribed	ABPM	wear	days.
However,	phone	call	and	email	reminders	will	additionally	encourage	proper	wear
time	per	protocol.	ABPM	data	will	be	downloaded	using	Accuwin	Pro	software
(Suntech	Medical,	Morrisville,	NC)	and	edited	using	the	Verdecchia	criteria	for
physiologic	BP	readings	and	notable	error	codes	(e.g.,	artifact	or	erratic	oscillotertic
signal)	given	in	the	AccuWin	pro	software	(138).	Daily	averages	of	BP	and	HR	to	be
compared	across	work	and	non-work	days	will	be	computed	as	24-hour,	daytime,
and	nocturnal	based	on	diary	reported	sleep	and	wake	time.
Job	Strain	Measurement
Job	strain	will	be	measured	once	daily	to	quantify	the	level	of	psychological	stress
that	the	participant	is	burdened	with	each	day	across	the	entire	work	day.	This
measurement	will	be	used	to	examine	potential	differences	in	cardiovascular
responses	in	participants	with	high	versus	low	average	job	strain	(Specific	Aim	III).	A
previous	study	mentioned	above	found	job	strain	to	be	associated	with	increased
HR	and	BP	during	work	(116).	Measurement	of	job	strain	will	be	completed	at	the

provide	essential	scientific	information	for	this	study,	and	this	will	reduce	the	time
requirements	for	completing	these	questionnaires.
6)	Treadmill	exercise	will	be	limited	to	only	those	qualified	for	the	study	and
therefore	are	considered	at	low	risk	for	a	cardiovascular	event.	Specifically,	any
individual	with	measured	resting	blood	pressure	of	≥150	mmHg	systolic	or	≥[ADDRESS_1154436]	will	be	prematurely	terminated	if	any	of	the	following
indications	are	met:
1.	Onset	of	angina-like	symptoms
2.	Drop	in	SBP	of	10	mm	Hg	with	an	increase	in	work	rate	or	if	SBP	decreases
below	the	value	obtained	in	the	same	position	prior	to	testing
3.	Excessive	rise	in	BP:	systolic	pressure	≥220	mm	Hg	and/or	diastolic	pressure
≥100	mm	Hg
4.	Shortness	of	breath,	wheezing,	leg	cramps,	or	claudication
5.	Signs	of	poor	perfusion:	light-headedness,	confusion,	ataxia,	pallor,	cyanosis,
nausea,	or	cold	and	clammy	skin
6.	Subject	requests	to	stop
7.	Physical	or	verbal	manifestations	of	severe	fatigue
8.	Failure	of	the	testing	equipment
The	exercise	test	will	also	be	conducted	by	[CONTACT_831784].	This	individual	is	holds	a	master’s
degree	in	exercise	physiology	as	well	as	is	trained	in	American	Heart	Association
Advanced	Cardiac	Life	Support	(ACLS)	to	ensure	appropriate	response
qualifications	in	the	case	of	an	emergency.	Furthermore,	during	all	exercise	tests,	a
second	person	will	be	present	in	the	room	to	assist	as	needed	in	the	case	of	a
response.	Finally,	a	faculty	member	of	the	department	of	health	and	physical	activity
will	be	present	in	the	building	during	the	exercise	test	to	assist	in	case	of	any
emergency	situation.

  BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION FOR CLINICAL STUDY Approximately [ADDRESS_827315] demonstrated that approximately 1/[ADDRESS_827316]-operative atrial fibrillation is systemic (oral or intravenous) amiodarone, which is a class III antiarrhythmic agent. While this particular drug is effective, it does carry the risk of several known complications. Due to the drug’s pharmacokinetics, amiodarone concentrates in organs with high lipid content such as the thyroid, liver and lung. Amiodarone has several known adverse effects on the lung ranging from acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_621485]. Amiodarone can have detrimental effects on the liver which in rare cases could lead to cirrhosis. Additionally, amiodarone can cause thyrotoxicosis as early as a few weeks after the initiation of amiodarone.   The adverse events listed above are related to the cumulative dose of amiodarone. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], when amiodarone is initiated, patients receive a loading dose of 600-800mg daily until the cumulative dose reaches [ADDRESS_827317] potential serious complications when administered systemically. The local application of amiodarone, could potentially decrease the rates of atrial fibrillation, while avoiding the systemic complications.  This has the potential to decrease length of stay and decrease additional procedures (ie. Cardioversion) in patients undergoing lung transplantation.

Currently, there is no preventive treatment strategy to reduce this burden. By [CONTACT_438191], we anticipate to demonstrate that amiodarone application through a hydrogel during the surgery is a safe and effective treatment strategy for the prevention of atrial arrhythmias. 3.3 ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS AND ADVERSE DRUG EFFECTS 3.3.1 ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS AND ADVERSE DRUG EFFECTS SECONDARY TO AMIODARONE HYDROGEL APPLICATION Currently, the only additional risk incurred by [CONTACT_621497] (slow heart rate). In a previous study, by [CONTACT_621498], in patients undergoing coronary artery by[CONTACT_4897], a similar intervention using amiodarone gel was assessed and the only complication noted in those patients was bradycardia. This complication was temporary and was not clinically significant. In the above study this was a common complication (greater than 10%), however it was not serious and did not require any additional treatment.  If bradycardia is severe enough to be symptomatic, transvenous pacing may be required, in order to maintain a normal heart rate. The risks from this procedure include but are not limited to: death, femoral hematoma, arrhythmias, fever, cardiac tamponade, deep venous thrombosis, and sepsis.  Animal studies and a previous human study did not demonstrate any evidence that the local application of an amiodarone gel to the heart could result in tissue damage. However, tissue damage has been reported if leaks from the vein occur when using intravenous amiodarone  A one-time dose of amiodarone will be used in the preparation of the amiodarone hydrogel.  While, the dose used in this study is extremely low, there are several known side effects of amiodarone use, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_621487]. These potential side effects include: nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity, fatigue, dizziness, paraesthesias, constipation, anorexia, visual disturbances, liver damage, pulmonary fibrosis, hypo or hyperthyroidism, insomnia, headache, sleep disturbances, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, SA node dysfunction, abdominal pain, hepatic disorders, flushing, abnormal taste and smell, edema, abnormal salivation and coagulation abnormalities.   3.3.2 ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS AND ADVERSE DRUG EFFECTS SECONDARY TO LUNG TRANSPLANT There are numerous risk to patients undergoing lung transplantation which include but are not limited to: death, hemorrhage, infection, viral infections, arrhythmias, rejection of transplant lung, bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, hemothorax, empyema, pulmonary embolism, post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, recurrence of primary disease and bronchogenic carcinoma.  3.4 RESIDUAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DRUG UNDER INVESTIGATION, AS IDENTIFIED IN THE RISK ANALYSIS REPORT Due to the short half-life and one time application of the amiodarone gel, no long term residual risk is anticipated.

The subject may therefore still return for subsequent visits and will not be excluded from the study.  If a subject withdraws from the clinical study, the site will record the subject’s reasons for withdrawal (if available), on a Withdrawal CRF.  When subject withdrawal from the clinical study is due to a study related adverse event the subject will be followed until resolution of that adverse event or determination that the subject’s condition is stable. The status of the subject’s condition should be documented at the time of withdrawal.   
 RISK There are numerous risks when undergoing lung transplantation. Subjects will be informed of these risks and sign a separate surgery consent. Currently the only identified potential risk incurred by [CONTACT_621503] (slow heart rate). In a previous study in patients undergoing coronary artery by[CONTACT_4897], a similar intervention using amiodarone gel was assessed and the only complication noted in those patients was temporary, not clinically significant bradycardia. In the previous study this was a common complication (greater than 10%), however it was not serious and did not require any additional treatment.  If bradycardia is severe enough to be symptomatic, transvenous pacing may be required, in order to maintain a normal heart rate. The risks from this procedure include but are not limited to: death, femoral hematoma, arrhythmias, fever, cardiac tamponade, deep venous thrombosis, and sepsis.  Animal studies and a previous human study did not demonstrate any evidence that the local application of an amiodarone gel to the heart could result in tissue damage. However, tissue damage has been reported if amiodarone leaks from the vein when using intravenous amiodarone.  A one-time dose of amiodarone will be used in the preparation of the amiodarone hydrogel.  While, the dose used in this study is extremely low, there are several known side effects of amiodarone use, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_621487]. These potential side effects include: nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity, fatigue, dizziness, paraesthesias, constipation, anorexia, visual disturbances, liver damage, pulmonary fibrosis, hypo or hyperthyroidism, insomnia, headache, sleep disturbances, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, SA node dysfunction, abdominal pain, hepatic disorders, flushing, abnormal taste and smell, edema, abnormal salivation and coagulation abnormalities.   Any serious, related, and unanticipated adverse events will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_827336] current versions of the FDA regulations, and any regional and/or national regulations, as appropriate.  The investigator will not start enrolling subjects or requesting informed consent from any subject prior to obtaining FDA and IRB approval.

For example, failure to adhere to the inclusion/exclusion criteria: these criteria are specifically defined by [CONTACT_093]/manunfacturer to exclude subjects for whom the drug is not beneficial and the use involves unreasonable risks. This may be considered failure to protect the rights, safety and well being of the enrolled subject. Similarly, failure to perform safety assessments intended to detect adverse events may be considered failure to protect the rights, safety and well being of the enrolled subject. Investigators should seek minimization of such risks by [CONTACT_110596].  Simultaneously, in the event that adhering to the CIP might expose the subject to unreasonable risks, the investigator is also required to protect the rights, safety and well being of the subject by [CONTACT_621504], so that subjects are not exposed to unreasonable risks.   It is the responsibility of the investigator to provide adequate medical care to a subject enrolled in a study.  Regulations require that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_115656], complete, and current records, including documents showing the date of and reason for every deviation from the Clinical Investigational Plan.  Relevant information for each deviation will be documented on a Deviation Case Report Form.   Regulations require Investigators obtain approval from IRB before initiating changes in or deviations from the protocol, except when necessary to protect the life or physical well being of a subject in an emergency.  Under emergency circumstances, deviations from the CIP to protect the rights, safety and well being of human subjects may proceed without prior approval of the IRB.

Ancillary testing:  abnormalities of vital signs, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic procedures (other than outcome measures: the results of which are not being captured as AEs).  Assessment of Clinical Adverse Events  The subject’s medical record will be accessed to determine the occurrence of any adverse events. The study team will review the medical records in a timely manner to determine adverse events and enable timely reporting:  1. Type of event 2. Date of onset and resolution (duration) 3. Severity (mild, moderate, severe) 4. Seriousness (does the event meet the above definition for an SAE) 5. Causality, relation to investigational product and disease 6. Action taken regarding investigational product 7. Outcome  Relatedness of Adverse Event to Investigational Product  The relationship of the AE to the investigational product should be specified by [CONTACT_198991], using the following definitions:  1. Definitely Not Related: Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable association with treatment. 2. Unlikely (probably not related): The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product, and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists. 3. Possibly Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product and follows a known response pattern to the suspected investigational product; the reaction could have been produced by [CONTACT_621506]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_243079]. (suspected ADR) 4. Probably Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of investigational product; is confirmed by [CONTACT_246416]-challenge; and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state. (suspected ADR) 5. Definitely Related: The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of investigational product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the investigational product; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_141507], and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure.

Patients who will dropout or withdraw from the study before reaching the primary end-point will be excluded from the study and replaced by [CONTACT_621510] 20 patients enrolled the study arm.  The primary end-point analysis will be based on the study groups as per the protocol (treatment group vs. control groups). Subjects, who withdraw consent, will not be included in analyses.   All clinically relevant baseline and follow up variables will be tabulated.  Means, medians, proportions and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. Comparisons of data collected at baseline and at follow-up will be analyzed as follows: categorical variables will be tested using contingency tables analyses (exact or chi-square approximations), and continuous variables will be tested using unpaired Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, depending on variable distribution. The post-transplant AFIB was evaluated between study and control groups for overall occurrence, AFIB lasting < 24 hours and AFIB lasting > 24 hours. All the data were analyzed using SAS 9.4 software (SAS Inc., Cary, NC).

However, tissue damage is reported if amiodarone leaks from the vein when using intravenous(in the blood vessels) amiodarone.   A one-time dose of amiodarone will be used in the preparation of the amiodarone hydrogel.  While, the dose used in this study is extremely low, there are several known side effects of amiodarone use. These side effects typi[INVESTIGATOR_621495] (either by [CONTACT_238090]) for an extended period of time. These potential side effects include:   Most Common side effects (occur in up to 33% of subjects) • nausea • vomiting  Common side effects (occur in 4-9% of subjects) • sensitivity to light • tiredness • dizziness • feelings of “pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]” (paraesthesias) • constipation • anorexia (loss of the urge to eat) • visual disturbances • liver damage • pulmonary fibrosis (lung damage)  Less Common (occurs in 1-3% of subjects) • hypo or hyperthyroidism (changes in the level of thyroid hormone) • insomnia • headache • sleep disturbances • heart problems (congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, SA node dysfunction) • abdominal pain • liver disorders • flushing • abnormal taste and smell • swelling (edema) • abnormal salivation • blood clotting abnormalities.

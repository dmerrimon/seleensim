TITLE:  
A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled  Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and 
Safety  of TRC101 in Subjects  with Chronic Kidney Disease and Metabolic Acidosis  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  
TRCA -[ADDRESS_863168]:  
TRC101  
INDICATION : 
Treatment of metabolic acidosis  associated  with chronic kidney dise ase (CKD)  
OBJECTIVES : 
Efficacy:  To evaluate the efficacy of TRC101 in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis  (blood bicarbonate 
12 to 20 mEq/L)  
Safety:     To evaluate the safety of administration of TRC101 in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis  
(blood bicarbonate 12 to 20 mEq/L)  
POPULATION : 
This study will enroll approximately 210 m ale and female subjects, 18 to 85 years of age with CKD  (an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR ] of 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73 m2) and low blood bicarbonate  (12 to 
20 mEq/L ).  At least half of the subjects enrolled will have a blood bicarbonate level of  12 to 18 mEq/L.  
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION : 
This is a double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel- design, 2-arm study .  Approximately 210 subjects will be 
randomized in a 4:3 ratio into one of the two arms (6 g TRC101 or placebo administered once daily [QD] 
with lunch).  
Study periods are the following:  
• Screening Period  (up to 2 weeks).  
• Treatment Period  (12 weeks)  starting with Baseline Visit (Day 1) .  At the end of 12- week Treatment 
Period eligible subjects may enroll into a 40 -week extension study.  
• Follow -up Period ([ADDRESS_863169] completes treatment or 
discontinues early)  for subjects who do not enroll in the extension study . 
After providing informed consent, the eligibility of potential subjects will be evaluated based on laboratory 
values,  medical history, concomitant medications, vital signs, pregnancy test (if applicable), and physical 
examination.  Three qualifying fasting blood bicarbonate values  (obtained at Screening 1, Screening 2, and 
Baseline Visits based on onsite measurement using an i -STAT point -of-care device) are required to establish 
subject’s eligibility .  Both Screening  blood bicarbonate v alues and the average of two Screening and Day 1  
values (i.e., baseline bicarbonate) must be within the range 12 to 20 mEq/L.  Two qualifying eGFR values of 
20 to 40 mL/min/1.73m2 at the Screening [ADDRESS_863170]’s 
eligibility .  The Screening [ADDRESS_863171] 5 days apart .   
Qualified subjects  will be randomiz ed on the morning of the Baseline Visit ( Day 1), which is the fi rst day of  
the 12-week Treatment Period .  A collection of baseline  venous blood and urine samples will be performed 
in a fasting  state pre-dose.  Following randomization, designated unblinded site staff will assist the subject in 
administering the first dose of study drug, which will be taken onsite in the morning with food (light meal or 
snack) after collection of baseline laboratory specimens.  Subjects will be given a dosing diary in which to  
record the time of study drug dosing.  
Subjects will continue dosing on an out -patient basis for the subsequent 12 weeks (Treatment Period) .  
Dosing of oral c oncomitant medications and study drug will be separated by [INVESTIGATOR_136] l east [ADDRESS_863172] 4 weeks of the Treatment Period , except for s ubjects with blood

Confidential   Page 6 of 80 bicarbonate  ≥ 27 mEq/L.  Subjects with a blood bicarbonate level of 27 to 30 mEq/L will have their dose of 
study drug decreased per the titration algorithm ( see Appendix  2).  Subjects with a confirmed blood 
bicarbonate level > 30 mEq/L , will undergo an interruption  of the study drug dose in accordance with the 
titration algorithm  (see Appendix  2).  Beginning at the Week 4 Visit, subjects with a blood bicarbonate level 
below the normal range ( < 22 mEq/L) will have a blinded adjustment of the study drug dose in accordance 
with the titration algorithm  (see Appendix  2).  At any time during the study, s ubjects  with a confirmed blood 
bicarbonate level  < 12 mEq/L will be evaluated by [CONTACT_644807].  The Medical Monitor will determine whether the subject m ay continue 
in the study .  During the 12-week Treatment Period, s ubjects will attend  eight study visits ( Day 1, Weeks 1, 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) for efficacy and safety assessments.   
Subjects who complete the Treatment Period will be offered participation  in a 40 -week extension study 
(TRCA -301E) .  Subjects who are not willing to participate in the extension study or who are not eligible will 
enter the 2-week Follow -up Period and return to the study site for two visits: Follow -up 1 (Week 13) and 
Follow -up 2 (Week 14), for adverse event (AE) collection, fasting blood draws and safety assessments as 
outlined in the Schedule of Events  (see Appendix 1).  Subj ects who withdraw from the study prematurely 
(i.e., prior to the Week 12 Visit) will undergo  an Early Termination (ET) Visit , during which all Week 12 
Visit assessments will be performed, followed by [CONTACT_31051] -up 1 and 2  Visits  in 1 and 2 weeks, respectively .  
Blood draws for bicarbonate measurements will be done  when subjects  are in a fasted state (at least 4 hours)  
and at approximately the same time of day for each subject.  
The maximum study duration is anticipated to be [ADDRESS_863173], including the Screening Period (up to 
2 weeks ), 12- week  Treatment Period , and 2-week  Follow -up Period .  The maximum TRCA -301 study 
duration for subjects who continue into the extension Study TRCA -301E will be 14 weeks (excluding the 2-
week Follow -up Period).

Confidential   Page 9 of 80 ENDPOINTS:  
Primary Efficacy:   
Having a c hange from baseline (CFB) in blood bicarbonate ≥ 4 mEq/L or having blood bicarbonate in 
the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L) at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  
Secondary Efficacy:  
CFB in blood bicarbonate at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  
Exploratory Efficacy:  
1. CFB in the total score of the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life ( KDQOL ) Question 3 items (daily 
activities) at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  
2. CFB in repeated chair stand test duration at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  
Safety:  
1. AEs, SAEs and withdrawal  of study treatment  due to AE.  
2. Having met the high bicarbonate dose interrup tion criterion (confirmed > 30 mEq/L) at any time 
during the Treatment P eriod . 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
This is a double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel- design, 2-arm, study.  Subjects will be randomized in a 
4:3 ratio into one of the two arms (6 g TRC101 or placebo administered QD with lunch).  Randomization  
will be stratified by [CONTACT_644810] (≤ 18 mEq/L vs. > 18 mEq/L)  and screening eGFR  
(< 30 mL/min/1.73m2 vs. ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2), which represents  an average of two eGFR values obtained at 
Screening 1 and Screening 2 Visits . 
Two populations will  be analyzed in this study:  
1. Modified intent -to-treat (MITT) analysis set:  All randomized subjects who had baseline and at least 
one post -baseline bicarbonate value s. 
2. Safety analysis set:  All subjects who received any amount of s tudy drug (TRC101 or place bo). 
Frequencies and percentages will be presented for the categorical variables and descriptive statistics will be 
presented for continuous variables.   
Efficacy :  Efficacy data will be summarized by [CONTACT_644811] b ased 
on the randomized treatment group assignment.  The bicarbonate results read from the i -STAT device will be 
the basis for efficacy evaluations.  
The primary efficacy analysis will compare TRC101 and placebo with respect to the proportions of subjects 
who are responders  at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit ).  Responders are  defined as having a CFB in 
blood bicarbonate ≥ 4 mEq/L or having blood bicarbonate in the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L) at the end of 
treatment (Week 12 Visit).  The primary endpoint analys is will include : 
1. The difference in proportion (between TRC101 and placebo subjects ) and its exact (Clopper -
Pearson)  95% CI , as well as  the p -value from Fisher’s exact test comparing the TRC101 group and 
the placebo group will be reported by [CONTACT_7206]; and    
2. The proportion of subjects in each group who are responders,  along with their exact (Clopper -
Pearson) 95% CIs,  will be summarized by [CONTACT_11571].   
The secondary  efficacy analysis will compare the  least squares (LS) mean s CFB  in bicarbonate level  between 
the TRC101 group and placebo group at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  The secondary  endpoint will 
be assessed using a longitudinal mixed model for repeated measures  (MMRM).   
Explor atory efficacy analyses will be specified in the statistical analysis plan  (SAP) . 
Statistical significance will be declared with  a two-sided test at the 0.05 level .  In order to control family -
wise error rate, statistical testing for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed 
sequentially .  At the Week 12  Visit, Fisher’s exact test  will be used to compare the group proportions .   If 
this formal test is statistically significant, a second formal test for the proportion of TRC101 responders at 
Week [ADDRESS_863189] ed.  Only when the primary efficacy result  is statistically significant will a formal 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -[ADDRESS_863190] for the secondary efficacy  endpoint  (CFB in blood bicarbonate at Week 12 Visit)  be performed.    
Safety :  Safety will be summarized by [CONTACT_644812].  Number and 
percentage of subjects with treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) classified by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT); number (%) of subjects experiencing TEAEs by [CONTACT_926], causality, seriousness and 
action taken with regard to study drug will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Number (%) of subjects with 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment will also be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Clinical laboratory test results, vital signs and ECG findings will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_11571]. The primary analysis for change in eGFR will be based on serum creatinine 
(a supportive analysis will use serum cystatin C , due to the potential for changes in muscle mass related to 
bicarbonate correction ).  Categorical display methods (e.g., frequencies, shift tables) and plots of laboratory 
values over time may also be used, as appropriate.  Newly observed, clinically significant physical examination findings will be listed. 
  
Other Analyses :  Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Exposure to study drug, dosing compliance, and concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  The number and percentage of subjects who use d prior and/or concomitant medications will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_236820] (ATC) classification levels and treatment group.   
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
Primary efficacy endpoint:  A sample size of [ADDRESS_863191] differences between the TRC101 - and placebo -treated groups.   
The sample size calculation is based on the data from the Phase 1/2 Study TRCA -101, where 3% of placebo 
and 46% of TRC101 treated subj ects had an increase in blood bicarbonate of ≥ 4 mEq/L or had blood 
bicarbonate in the normal range at Week 2.  We assume the full TRC101 treatment effect had not been reached during this short treatment period.  In Study TRCA -301, we expect to observe that 50 to 55% of 
TRC101 -treated and 10% of placebo -treated subjects will have an increase of ≥ 4 mEq/L or have blood 
bicarbonate in the normal range at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  A Fisher's exact test with a 0.[ADDRESS_863192] over 99% power to detect this difference when 90 placebo subjects 
and 120 TRC101 subjects are enrolled.  If the true proportion of TRC101 subjects who respond at the Week 12 Visit is indeed between 50% and 55% and if no more than 5% of subjects have missing data at Week 12, 
the study will have roughly 90% power to result in a 95% confidence limit with a lower bound of at least 35% and 40%, respectively .   
The s ample size calculation for the secondary efficacy endpoint will be documented in the SAP.

1.1 Disease Background 
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) continue to generate acid from metabolism but 
have a reduced ability to excrete acid via the kidney.  As a result, metabolic acidosis, characterized by a reduced blood bicarbonate concentration (i.e., below 22 mEq/L), can 
develop in advanced stages of CKD.  Chronic metabolic acidosis affects 13 – 39% of CKD Stage 3 – 5 patients ( Eustace, 2004; Raphael, 2014; Moranne, 2009).  If chronic metabolic 
acidosis is left untreated, the consequences include increased mortality, acceleration of kidney disease, acceleration of muscle breakdown, and the development or exacerbation of bone disease ( Dobre, 2015).   
Clinical outcomes for CKD patients with bicarbonate levels that are below normal 
(i.e., < 22 mEq/L) are s ignificantly worse compared to pa tients  with normal bicarbonate 
(i.e., 22 – 29 mEq/L) ; this has been demonstrated in multiple large retrospective database 
analyses  reported in the literature  (Shah 2009; Dobre 2013; Raphael 2011; Tangri 2011; 
Kovesdy 2009; Navaneethan 2011; Raphael 2016).  The relationship be tween decreasing 
bicarbonate levels and clinical outcomes is believed to be a continuum (i.e., as bicarbonate decreases  from normal levels  the risk of adverse outcomes , such as death, progression of 
CKD and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], progressively increases ).  Hazar d ratios for patients with 
bicarbonate levels in the range required for subjects in this study (i.e., 12 to 20 mEq/L) are significantly worse than for patients with bicarbonate levels indicative of more mild metabolic acidosis (i.e., > 20 to 22 mEq/L).  Correction of low bicarbonate levels in patients with CKD (i.e., with oral alkali supplementation or consumption of a less acidic diet) has been shown to result in slowing of progression of renal disease ( de Brito -Ashurst 2009; 
Phisitkul 2010 ; Mahajan 2010; Goraya 2013; Goraya 2014; Garneata 2016 ), improvements in 
muscle mass/function ( de Brito -Ashurst 2009; Abramowitz 2013) and improvement in bone 
health ( Domrongkitchaiporn 2002).  
Currently , no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_644797].  Use of unapproved oral alkali supplements (e.g., food 
additives such as oral sodium bicarbonate and off- label use of potassium citrate) is general 
clinical  practice, however these agents have been studied only in patients with mild 
metabolic acidosis.  Most prospective trials limited doses of oral sodium bicarbonate to < [ADDRESS_863204] increases in blood bicarbonate of 2 – 3 mEq/L.  The daily doses of sodium bicarbonate required to increase blood bicarbonate levels by 3 – 4 mEq/L in 
patients with metabolic acidosis are prohibitively high (6 – 8 g per day introducing 
1.6 – 2.2 g of sodium ; Abramowitz 2013).  Combined with the sodium intake from diet, this 
would result in a total daily sodium load exceeding the gui deline- recommended limit of 
2.4 g/day for CKD patients (KDOQI, 2002 ) independent of underlying comorbidities.  
Furthermore, common conditions accompanying CKD (e.g., hypertension, heart failure, edema) may be aggravated by [CONTACT_236821][INVESTIGATOR_644798] .  As such, there is a clear unmet medical need for new treatments with 
demonstrated efficacy and safety to treat chronic metabolic acidosis.  
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -[ADDRESS_863205] absorption of particles from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, consistent with 
several literature reports that show particles larger than 0.5 micrometers are not systemically 
absorbed ( Jung, 2000 ).  Nonclinic
al studies with radiolabeled TRC101 conducted in rats and 
dogs confirmed the lack of systemic absorption of TRC101. 
TRC101 is insoluble in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents.  TRC101 has both high H+ and Cl- 
binding ca pacity and Cl- binding selectivity.  The high amine content of the polymer is 
responsible for the high H+ and Cl- binding capacity of TRC101 and the polymer’s extensive 
crosslinking provides size exclusion properties and selectivity for binding Cl- over ot her 
potential interfering anions.  The TRC101 mechanism of action involves binding of H+ and 
Cl-, resulting in a net reduction and removal of hydrochloric acid from the GI tract which 
results in an increase in serum bicarbonate levels.  Binding Cl- in addition to H+  reduces 
exchange of Cl- with bicarbonate in the GI lumen, preventing a subsequent decrease in serum 
bicarbonate.  
The TRC101 drug substance is packaged in individual-dose packets  without addition of any 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_236805] (i.e., drug product), a powder for oral 
suspension also c
alled TRC101. 
1.[ADDRESS_863206].  The marked binding 
capacity and selectivity for HCl observed with TRC101 in vitro translates into in vivo 
pharmacological effects.  When TRC101 was packaged in nylon sachets, fed to a single pig, and then recovered from collected feces, analysis of the anions bound to the recovered 
polymer r evealed an in vivo binding of 2.6 mEq of chloride pe
r gram of TRC101.  
Furthermore, removal of HCl by [CONTACT_28117]101 results in a dose-dependent increase in mean serum 
bicarbonate , as obs
erved in rats with adenine-induced nephropathy and metabolic acidosis 
compared to untreated controls.   
1.3.2 Safety Pharm
acology 
The nonclinical Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) safety program for TRC101 includes three 
studies assessing safety pharmacology.  These assessments of the central nervous system  
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 20 of 80 (CNS), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular (CV), and GI systems did not identify any TRC101-
related adverse effect s in rats up to 2 g/kg/day (GI)  or up to 4 g/kg/day (CNS, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]) 
and in dogs up to 2 g/kg/day (CV).   
1.3.3 Nonclinical ADME  
TRC101 is insoluble in both aqueous and organic solvents.  Due to its insolubility, stability , 
and size 
(averaging 100 
micrometers in diameter ), the polymer is not anticipated to be 
absorbed from
 the lumen of the GI tract.  To confirm lack of absorption following oral 
administration, the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of radiolabeled TRC101, in both rats and dogs, were characterized after a single oral dos e of 
[
14C]-TRC101.  The studies demonstrated no radioactivity in tissues or organs other than the 
GI tract, no detectable radiolabel in  the plasma, approximately 95 – 99% of the radioactive 
dose excreted in the feces with most recovered within the first 48 hours after dosing, and ≤ 0.02% of radiolabel excreted in the urine of dogs and rats.  The level of radioactivity excreted in urine was consistent with the level of unincorporated radiolabel measured in a water extraction of the radiolabeled polymer, [
14C]-TRC101.  Therefore, it can be concluded 
that TRC101 is  not systemically absorbed following oral administration in rats and dogs. 
1.3.4 Nonclinical Toxicology 
Nonclinical toxicology studies of TRC101 to date include non- Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP ) 7-day repeat dose toxic ology studies in rats and dogs; a GLP 33- day repeat dose 
toxic ology study with a 2 -week recovery in rats; a GLP 28 -day repeat dose toxicology study 
with a 2 -week recovery in dogs; GLP 13 -week repeat dose toxicology interim analyses  in the 
rat and the dog as part of the chronic toxicology studies, a screening non -GLP in vitro 
genotoxicity study (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames] assay), and two GLP in vitro 
genotoxicity studies (Ames assay and chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes); non- GLP pi[INVESTIGATOR_97405] -fetal development (EFD) studies in the rat and 
the rabbit; no single dose studies were conduc ted.  The oral route of exposure was selected 
for the repeat  dose toxicology and EFD studies in rats, rabbits, and/or dogs because this is the 
intended route of human exposure.  These studies demonstrate that TRC101 has a very low order of toxicity; the genotoxicity studies demonstrate that TRC101 is neither mutagenic nor 
clastogenic; the pi[INVESTIGATOR_644799]101- related effects 
on maternal reproductive function or embryo -fetal parameters .  There were no effects on male 
or female reproductive organs in the GLP repeat dose toxicology  studies in rat and dog.  The no 
observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for the 13-week  repeat dose toxicology interim 
analyses  were the highest doses tested, i.e., 2 g/kg/day in rat s and dogs, providing support for 
up to 12 weeks of dosing in humans with TRC101 doses up to 9 g/day.  In the same studies, 
local tolerance was assessed, and histopathological evaluation of the GI tract indicated that 
TRC101 was generally well tolerated.   Tricida has received a waiver from the Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA ) for the conduct of the in vivo micronucleous assay, the male and female 
fertility and early embryonic development study in rats , and the peri - and post -natal 
developmental study in rats.  No carcinogenicity studies of TRC101 have been conducted.

1.4.1 Study TRCA-101 
To date, TRC101 has been studied in one Phase 1/2 clinical trial, Study TRCA-101, 
in subjects with CKD Stage 3 – 4 (estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] 20 to  
< 60 mL/min/1.73m2) and baseline serum bicarbonate levels of 12 to 20 mEq/L.  Study 
TRCA -101 was a double-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel-design, 6-arm, fixed dose study, 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of three doses of TRC101 (3, 6 and 9 g/day) and two 
dosing regimens (once daily [QD] and twice daily [BID]) versus placebo.  Subjects en rolled 
in Study TRCA-101 were treated for 2  weeks while in residence at the clinical research units , 
after which they were  discharged  and followed for up to an additional 2 weeks  (off 
treatment ).  While in residence during the treatment period, subjects ate a standardized study 
diet controlled for protein and caloric content, as well as anions, cations and fiber, in accordance with dietary recommendations for CKD patients  (KDOQI, 2002 ).  Care was 
taken to ensure the diet was neither acidic nor basic.  The specific foods selected for the 
menus were chosen to closely approximated the regions’ typi[INVESTIGATOR_236809].  The primary objective 
of the study was to assess the  safety and tolerability of TRC101.  The main efficacy endpoint 
was change from baseline (CFB) to end -of-treatment in serum bicarbonate level.  
The study population comprised 135 subjects (86 male and 49 female), with a mean age of 
60.3 years  (range of 30 to 79 years) , a mean baseline eGFR  of 34.8 mL/min/1.73m
2 (range of 
19 to 66 mL/min/1.73m2; 44.4% with CKD Stage 4)  and a mean baseline serum bicarbonate 
level of 17.7 mEq/L (range of 14.1 – 20.4 mEq/L) .  Subjects  had baseline comorbidities 
common in CKD patients, including hypertension (93.3%), diabetes ( 69.6%), left ventricular 
hypertrophy (28.9%), and congestive heart failure (21.5%).  As would be expected in a CKD 
Stage 3 – 4 population, nearly all study subjects had indications for sodium restriction:  
hypertension (93.3%), congestive heart failure ( 21.5%), periphe ral edema ( 14.1%) and use of 
diuretics ( 42.2%).   Because TRC101 does not result in sodium load as discussed in 
Section  1.2, enrollment of such subjects was appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  
A 14 -day t reatment with TRC10 1, at doses of 1.5, 3 or 4.5 g BID, or 6 g QD, appeared to be 
safe and generally well tolerated.  I n the 135 subjects who participated  (104 subjects in the 
TRC101 combined group and 31 subjects in the placebo group), there were no deaths, adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation, or serious adverse events  (SAEs).  The 
overall incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was 53.8% in the TRC101 
combined group (26.9% assessed as related to study drug) of and 45.2% in the placebo group 
(12.9% assessed as related to study drug) .  The majority of reported TEAE s were mild  in 
severity : 44.2% in the TRC101 combined group (26.0% assessed as related to study drug) 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 22 of 80 and 35.5% in the placebo group (12.9% ass essed as related to study drug ).  Fewer TEAEs 
were reported as moderate: 9.6% in the TRC101 combined group (1.0% assessed as related 
to study drug) and 9.7% in the placebo group (none assessed as related ).  No severe or SAEs  
were reported  in either treatment group . 
The most commo n adverse events (≥ 5% incidence) in the TRC101- treated subjects were 
diarrh oea (20.2%), headache ( 7.7%), constipation (6.7%), and hyperglyc aemia  (6.7%).  The 
most common adverse events in the placebo-treated subje cts were diarrh oea (12.9%), 
glomeru lar filtration rate decreased ( 6.5%), blood glucose increased (6.5%), and 
hypoglycaemia (6.5%) .  No event appeared to be dose- related.  
Gastrointestinal (GI)  adverse events were the most commonly reported in TRC101- treated 
subjects, which is consistent with a non-absorbed drug acting primarily within the GI  tract, 
and all were mild or moderate in severity .  Diarrh oea was the most common adverse event; 
all events were mild, self -limited, of short duration, often resolving w hile study treatment 
was ongoing, and none required treatment or resulted in discontinuation of study drug or 
early withdrawal from the study.  Diarrh oea events exhibited no apparent dose response, 
occurring in 36.0%, 12.0%, 23.1% of subjects in the 1.5, 3, and 4.5 g BID TRC101 dose 
groups, respectively , and in 10.7% of subjects in the 6 g QD TRC101 group.  In the pooled 
placebo group diarrhoea occurred in 12.9% of subjects.  Given the small numbers, there is 
likely no difference between the groups. 
No tren ds suggest ed an off -target effect of TRC101 on other electrolytes (i.e., sodium, 
potassium, magnesium, calcium or phosphate).  N o treatment -related effect on serum 
chloride levels or any effect on urine electrolytes  was observed .  No subject experienced 
increases in serum bicarbonate that resulted in metabolic alkalosis (i.e., serum bicarbonate 
> 29 mEq/L).  There were also no trends suggesting an effect of TRC101 on renal function, 
liver function, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], vital signs or ECG intervals.  
For additional detail s regarding the safety data from Study TRCA -101, see the TRC101 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  
Over a 2 -week treatment period, TRC101 significantly increased serum bicarbonate levels in 
the study population of CKD patients with baseline serum bicarbonate levels ranging from 
14.1 to 20.4 mEq/L.  TRC101 had a rapid onset of action (i.e., statistically significant increase in mean within group CFB  in serum bicarbonate ; p < 0.0001) within the first 24  – 48 
hours following the initiation of treatment for all TRC101 dose groups combined.  The onset 
of action for between -group differences (active vs. placebo ) appeared  to occur between  
48 – 72 hours after the initiation of treatment with TRC101.  At Day 4  ([ADDRESS_863207] dose of TRC101), the mean increase in  serum bicarbonate from baseline for each 
TRC101 group was 1  – 2 mEq/L:  1.5 g BID  (p = 0.0011); 3 g BID (p = 0.0001); 6 g QD 
(p = 0.0003); 4.5 g BID (p < 0.0001).  
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 23 of 80 At Day 15, a ll active doses/dosing regimens evaluated (1.5, 3 and 4.5 g TRC101 BID and 6 g 
TRC101 QD) showed statistically significantly (p < 0.0001) increased mean serum 
bicarbonate levels from baseline by [CONTACT_3450] 3 – 4 mEq/L and each dose increased 
serum bicarbonate levels to a significantly (p  < 0.0001) greater extent than placebo .  The 
observed increase in serum bicarbonate in each TRC101 dose group did not appear to be 
dose- or dosing regimen-dependent, except for potentially earlier onset of action in the 
highest TRC101 group, 4.5 g BID.  
After 2 weeks of treatment, the TRC101 6 g QD dose group demonstrated a similar increase 
from baseline in serum bicarbonate compared to the TRC101 3 g BID dose group 
(3.51 mEq/L versus 2.98 mEq/L, respectively), and the difference between the QD and BID 
dosing regimens was not statistically significant (p  = 0.3408). 
Figure  1 illustrates the steady increase in mean serum bicarbonate observed in all TRC101 
dose groups during the 14- day treatment period with a mean increase at the end of treatment 
of approximately 3 to  4 mEq/L  across all active dose groups.  The slope of serum bicarbonate 
increase remained constant in all TRC101 dose groups, with no evidence of serum bicarbonate reaching a plateau at  the end of 2- week treatment.  Therefore, the maximal effect 
of each TRC101 dose tested in Study TRCA- 101 ha s not yet been determined.  Serum 
bicarbonate levels in the placebo group remained essentially unchanged throughout the study, 
suggesting that the diet with a controlled protein (0.66 g/kg/day on average) and cation/anion 
content administered in the clinical research unit matched well with  what the subjects  ate at 
home and, therefore,  had no significant impact on the ir serum bicarbonate values.  
The 2 -week treatment period in study TRCA-101 was followed by a 2-week follow-up 
period during which subjects were off treatment.  Following discontinuation of TRC101, serum bicarbonate levels  decreased within  2 days and were near their baseline values within 
9 days (Figure  1).  These results underscore the rapid reversibility of TRC101 effect .  In 
addition, the data demons trate that chronic nature of the underlying metabolic acidosis in 
these CKD patients  and suggest that continued treatment with TRC101 would be needed to 
maintain elevated serum bicarbonate level.

1.[ADDRESS_863208] ; thus, oral administration is the appropriate route.  A d ose of 6 g QD TRC101 was 
chosen as the starting dose for this study  since it was shown  to be safe, well tolerated, and 
efficacious in Study TRCA-101 (along with the 1.5 g BID, 3 g BID  and 4.5 g BID TRC101 
doses).  A starting dose of  6 g provides the option of bidirectional dose adjustment (i.e., up or 
down titration), thus potentially allowing greater flexibility in controlling blood bicarbonate 
levels compared to  a [ADDRESS_863209] arting dose.  A QD dosing regimen is more convenient for 
study subjects than a BID dosing regimen and therefore may result in greater compliance 
during a 12-week treatment period.  P lacebo  QD will be used as a comparator .  Additional 
details on the rationale for the doses, dosing regimen and treatment period are provided in Section 3.2. 
1.6 Description of Population to be Studied  
In the completed Study TRCA-101, the allowable ranges for eGFR and blood bicarbonate were 20 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m
2 and 12 to 20 mEq/L, respectively.  The population studied in 
this clinical study is CKD patients with chronic metabolic acidosis who have eGFR from 20 

TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 25 of 80 to 40 mL/min/1.73m2 and blood bicarbonate levels from  12 to  20 mEq/L.  At least half of the 
subjects enrolled will have blood bicarbonate level of 12 to 18 mEq/L. 
This study is designed to provide significant overlap with the population investigated in 
Study TRCA -101 and in future investigational studies of TRC101. 
The lower limit of the bicarbonate range is intended to exclude patients who are acutely 
acidotic as their management is largely aimed at rapid treatment of the underlying etiology of 
the acidosis.  Whereas clinical practice guidelines also recommend treating milder acidosis 
(serum bicarbonate > 20 to 22 mEq/L) ( KDIGO 2013 ; KDOQI 2 003), the population for the 
current study will include only those with blood bicarbonate 12 to 20 mEq/L.  This is to ensure that all subjects have significant metabolic acidosis . 
To make the study more generalizable to the intended target population of CK D patients, this 
study will be conducted in outpatients whose dietary intake is not mandated by [CONTACT_17143], unlike the in- unit TRCA -[ADDRESS_863210] been removed from this protocol, and subjects with more severe heart failure (i.e., NYHA Class III) may be enrolled   
(see Appendix 3). 
This protocol allows the use of “background” medications that can affect eGFR and blood bicarbonate (e.g ., oral alkali, calcium  supplements, diuretics, renin angiotensin aldosterone 
system [RAAS] inhibitors) with some restrictions .   Doses of alkali  medications may not be 
changed  and new oral alkali therapi[INVESTIGATOR_644800].  If a subject 
requires treatment for sustained, clinically -significant worsening of metabolic acidosis during 
the study in the judgment of the Investigator, diet counseling (i.e., reduced protein intake, vegetarian/vegan protein sources) may  be implemented  as clinically appropriate and in 
agreement with the Medical Monitor .  Subjects with confirm ed blood bicarbonate decrease 
< 12 mEq/L should be investigated for possible causes of acute-on-chronic acidosis and the Investigator should discuss these cases with the Medical Monitor.  The rationale for 
allowance of alkali treatment is to avoid significan tly worsening acidosis among the placebo 
subjects; however, maintaining a stable dose of such treatments is necessary to avoid 
confounding of the primary efficacy measurement.  Subjects may be, but are not required to be, on RAAS inhibitor(s) at Baseline.  Investigators will be advised to avoid changing RAAS 
inhibitor doses during the study, when possible, but dose changes necessary for the management of comorbidities or acute events (e.g., hyperkalemia/ worsening hyperkalemia )

1.7 Description of Assay Methodology for Measurement of B lood/Serum 
Bicarbonate Concentration  
Bicarbonate concentrations in venous blood will be assessed in this study usin g the i-STAT 
System (handheld blood analyzer with G3+ cartridge manufactured by [CONTACT_644814], 
Princeton, NJ) in all subjects .  In addition,  either a clinical chemistry analyzer performing 
enzymatic measurement of bicarbonate in serum  or a benchtop venous blood gas analyzer for 
measuring bicarbonate will be used consistent ly for each subject .  These assays (with  the i-
STAT assay and one of two other assays being mandatory) will be conducted at the local 
laboratory or at the study site.  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted using bicarbonate concentrations collected from the i-STAT devices.  The i-STAT measurements of blood bicarbonate l evels will be the basis of 
study drug dose adjustment decisions.  Data from the other assay methodolog y (either 
enzymatic or venous blood gas bicarbonate analysis) will be evaluated  in an exploratory 
manner . 
The two blood gas analysis methods (benchtop and i- STAT ) provide a calculated bicarbonate 
concentration from measurement of pH and pCO
[ADDRESS_863212] clinical laboratories directly measures the total CO 2 (bicarbonate 
+ dissolved CO 2) concentration in a serum sample using an assay that relies upon the 
conversion of dissolved CO 2 to HCO 3- with base, followed by a series of enzymatic reactions 
resulting in a decrease in the 380/410 nm absorbance of the reacti on mixture . 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Efficacy  
This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy of TRC101 in CKD patients with metabolic 
acidosis  (blood bicarbonate 12 to 20 mEq/L). 
2.2 Safety  
This study is intended to evaluate the safety of administration of TRC101 in CKD patients 
with metabolic acidosis  (blood bicarbonate 12 to 20 mEq/L).

Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -[ADDRESS_863213] dose of study 
drug, which will be taken onsite in the morning with food (light meal or snack)  after 
collection of baseline laboratory specimens.  Subjects will be given a dosing diary in which 
to record the time of study drug dosing. 
Subjects will continue dosing on an out-patient basis for the subsequent 12 weeks (Treatment 
Period).  Dosing of oral c oncomitant medications and study drug will be separated by [CONTACT_2669] 
[ADDRESS_863214] 4 weeks of the Treatment Period , 
except for subjects with  blood bicarbonate ≥ 27 mEq/L .  Subjects with a blood bicarbonate 
level of 27 to 30 mEq/L will have their dose of study drug decreased per the blinded titration 
algorithm (see Appendix 2).   Subjects with a confirmed blood bicarbonate level of 
> 30 mEq/L  will undergo an interruption of the study drug dose in accordance with the 
titration algorithm ( see Appendix 2).  Beginning at the Week 4 Visit, subjects with a blood 
bicarbonate level below the normal range (< 22 mEq/L) will have a blinded  adjustment of the 
study drug dose in accordance with the titration algorithm (see Appendix 2).  At any time during the study, s ubjects with confirmed  blood bicarbonate level < 12 mEq/L will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_644815].  The Medical Monitor will determine whether the subject may continue in the study. 
During the 12- week Treatment Period, subjects will attend  eight  study visits ( Day 1, 
Weeks  1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) for efficacy and safety assessments.  Subjects  will be  fasted 
(other than water) for at least 4 hours  prior to blood draws.  Assessments will be performed at 
the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1).  Safety assessmen ts will 
include:  adverse events (AEs), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]); physical examination (including body weight); clinical laboratory testing (Table 2), and 12- lead ECG s.  Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_644816]. 
Subjects who complete the Treatment Period will be offered participation in a 40- week 
extension study (TRCA-301E).  Subjects who are not willing to participate in the extension 
study or who are not eligible will enter the 2 -week Follow -up Period and return to the study 
site for two visits: Follow -up 1 ( Week 13) and Follow-up 2 (Week 14), for adverse event 
collection, fasting blood draws and safety assessments as outlined in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1).  Subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely (i.e., prior to the Week 12 
Visit) will undergo an Early Termination (ET) Visit during which all Week [ADDRESS_863215] of the study.

3.2.1 Study Design  
This study is randomized to reduce bias.  Because no approved treatment  is available  for 
chronic metabolic acidosis , placebo was chosen as the comparator .  Furthermore , a 
comparison to placebo allows for better characterization  of the efficacy and safety of new 
chemical entities.  However, due to the chronicity and severity of the baseline metabolic 
acidosis in this 12- week study, s ubjects receiving oral alkali treatment at baseline will be 
allowed to continue on this treatment at stable doses to avoid significant worsening of 
acidosis in the placebo -treated subjects . 
The Investigators, site personnel (except for designated unblinded staff responsible for study 
drug dispensing and accountability ), subjects, Tricida , contr act research organization (CRO) 
personnel (except for those responsible for unblinded moni toring) will be blinded to reduce 
bias.  The data monitoring committee ( DMC ) members  and the statisticians responsible for 
reporting to the DMC will be unblinded during the study.  A blinding plan will describe the 
specific requirements for maintaining the  blind at the site and sites will be trained on these 
requirements . 
In the completed Study TRCA-101, treatment with TRC101 for 2 weeks resulted in a significant increase in serum bicarbonate in all three  doses studied (3, 6 and 9 g/day) 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS]
); however, the maximum effect of each of these fixed doses was not 
determined.  At the end of 2 weeks, all three BID dosing re gimens ( 1.5 g, 3 g, and 4.5 g) as 
well as the QD dosing regimen (6 g) appeared to be similarly effective based on mean 
changes from baseline in serum bicarbonate after 2 weeks .  However, a greater proportion of 
subjects receiving  3 g BID and 4.5 g BID  achieved larger increases in blood bicarbonate 
(e.g., ≥ 4 mEq/L) than the lowe st 1.5 g BID dose.  Based on these findings, the mid -dose 
(i.e., 6 g QD ) was selected as the starting dose for this study .  The  subjects whose blood 
bicarbonate is below the normal range after [ADDRESS_863216] of TRCA-301 includes appropriate monitoring for safety and risk mitigation.  The Medical Monitor will review blinded safety data on an ongo ing basis to 
identify potential adverse safety trends.  Central laboratory reports will contain flags tha t will

study.  
TRC101 is a high molecular weight, counterion-free polymer.  It is not absorbed and does not circulate systemically.  Experience in Study TRCA -101 has shown that the anticipated 
risks of treatment with TRC101 are non-serious, mild to moderate, short- lived diarrhea or 
constipation, that generally resolves while treatment is ongoing.  A dverse events will be 
monitored throughout the study. 
Risks of TRC101 effects  on non- target substances (e.g., serum potassium, magnesium, 
calcium, phosphate, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]) were not evident in  the clinical data from Study TRCA -101; 
nevertheless, close attention will be paid to electrolyte levels , which will be assessed at every 
study visit. No cases of  alkalosis  (i.e., serum bicarbonate > 29 mEq/L ) were observed in  Study 
TRCA -101.  However, an exaggerated pharmacological effect of TRC101 is theoretically 
possible, given the longer duration of treatment in this study.  While kidneys are generally 
efficient at excreting excess bi carbonate, the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_236810].   To avoid prolonged periods of blood bicarbonate above the 
normal range,  blood bicarbonate levels will be measured at every study visit and study drug 
dose will be blindly decreased  if blood bicarbonate level is 27 to  30 mEq/L and interrupted if 
blood bicarbonate is confirmed to be > 30 mEq/L.   It is known from Study TRCA -[ADDRESS_863218] within approximately 1 week of treatment discontinuation and with serum bicarbonate returning 
essentially back to baseline within approximately 2 weeks  of treatment discontinuation.  In 
addition, patients with higher risk of inhibition of respi[INVESTIGATOR_236811] (i.e., COPD that is treated with chronic oral steroids, that requires the subject to be on oxygen, or that required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_236812] 6 months ) will be excluded from

Study drug will be dispensed by [CONTACT_644820] (hereafter referred to as “the Pharmacist”) according to the 
subject’s treatment assignment.  The  exact dispensing instruction s will be provided to the 
Pharmacist  by [CONTACT_49120] (IRT) system .   
The Pharmacist will be responsible for maintaining complete study drug dispensing, 
returning, and dosing records for each study subject enrolled at the site .  
5.2 Treatment (s) Administered

• 6 g TRC101 QD (n~120) 
• Placebo QD (n~90) 
Subjects with blood bicarbonate values of 12 to 18 mEq/L will be randomized without 
restriction.  Once 105 subjects with blood bicarbonate values of > 18 to 20 mEq/L at baseline 
(i.e., average of Screening Visit 1, Screening Visit 2, and pre-dose Day 1 val ues) have been

subjects with elevation of blood bicarbonate ≥ 27 mEq/L.  If the  blood bicarbonate level is 27 
to 30 mEq/L at any time during the Treatment Period through Week 11, the study drug dose will be decreased by 1 packet/day (minimum dose is 0 packets/day).  Beginning at the Week 
4 Visit, subjects with a blood bicarbonate level below the normal range (< 22  mEq/L) will 
have a blinded adjustment of the study drug dose in accordance with the titration algorithm 
(see Appendix 2).  The study drug dose will only be titrated if NO dose changes have been 
made during the previous 14 days.  If blood bicarbonate is confirmed to be > 30 m Eq/L  at 
any time during the study , the study drug treatment will be interrupted, no study drug will be 
dispensed to the subject, and the subject will be invited for a visit in approximately [ADDRESS_863241] blood bicarbonate .  If blood bicarbonate decreases to < 27 mEq/L and the subject is 
still within the Treatment Period, study drug should be re- started at a lower dose in 
accordance with the titration algorithm (see Appendix 2).  If blood bicarbonate is 
≥ 27 mEq/L, the study drug dosing should be withheld until blood bicarbonate is 
< 27 mEq /L. 
No dose titration will be allowed after Week 11 (i.e., [ADDRESS_863242] dose).  Dose titrations are blinded. 
The Medical Monitor must be notified within 24 hours of confirmation of a bicarbonate value 
> 30 mEq/L  or < 12 mEq/L.  Dose interruptions due to blood bicarbonate elevations should 
be performed on the basis of i- STAT measurements , except in unusual situations when they

sustained, clinically -significant worsening of metabolic acidosis during the study in the 
judgment of the Investigator, diet counseling (i.e., reduced protein intake, vegetarian/vegan 
protein sources) may be implemented as clinically appropriate and in agreement with the Medical Monitor.  
6.11 Adverse Events  
6.11.1 Definition  of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation  
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal  
relationship with this treatment” ( ICH E2A Guideline: Clinical Safety Data Management: 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, October 1994).  An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable or unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 47 of 80 (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
This includes:  
• Any new medical  condition, sign or symptom or newly diagnosed event that occurs 
during the AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with an 
underlying condition that were not present prior to the AE reporting period (from the time 
the subject signs the ICF until the completion of the last study visit assessments) ;  
• A previous condition that has worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character during the AE reporting period;  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions; 
• Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug interaction; and  
• Signs, symptoms or the cli nical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investigational 
product or a concomitant medication. 
For the purposes of this protocol, events that are not considered AEs include: 
• Isolated decline in blood bicarbonate or blood pH, even if assessed as clin ically 
significant by [CONTACT_737] ; 
• Anticipated fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at 
the start of the study unless judged by [CONTACT_196229]’s underlying condition;  
• Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should 
not be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example , an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE; 
• Placement of a dialysis access  
- If the access placement was prompted by [CONTACT_644824], then the latter should be reported as an AE and the access placement should be reported as an action taken for the AE. 
• Overdose in the absence of other signs/symptoms will not be reported as an AE in its own right; and  
• Pregnancy ; however, any pregnancy complication should be recorded as an AE. 
Out of range laboratory results and abnormal ECGs, vital signs and other safety assessments 
will be considered AEs if they meet at least one of the following criter ia: 
• Associated  with symptoms or lead to a diagnosis (in such case the symptom or diagnosis 
should be recorded as an AE) ;  
• Lead to discontinuation of study drug; or 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 48 of 80 • The abnormality is deemed  clinically  significant in its own right (i.e., if some action or 
intervention or alteration of treatment is required or if the Investigator judges the change 
to be beyond the range of normal physiological fluctuation). 
6.11.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  (SAE ) is an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life -threatening. (This refers to a subject who, in the view of the Investigator or 
Tricida , was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe).  
• Requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], with the 
exception of: 
– Visits to the emergency room or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_236814] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_644804] 24 hours 
– Elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened 
– Routine health assessments requiring admission not associated with any deterioration 
in condition 
– Social admission (lack of housing, family circumstances, etc.) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in  
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_644805] (e.g., blood dyscrasias, convulsions). 
 
Either the Investigator or Tricida  can determine that an AE meets the definition of serious.   If 
either believes that the event is serious, t he event must be considered serious and evaluated 
by [CONTACT_236838]. 
6.11.3 Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is an AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  For the purpose s of Investigational New Drug ( IND) safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.   
All AEs judged by [CONTACT_236839] a reasonable causal 
relati onship to a study drug will be designated as suspected adverse drug reactions.

Confidential   Page 49 of 80 6.11.4 Procedures for Eliciting, Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Reporting Period 
AEs, including SAEs, will be collected throughout the study period, beginning from the time 
the subject signs the ICF until the subject’s last study visit.  Any AE or SAE that is assessed 
by [CONTACT_644825] , whenever possible, until it resolves  or becomes stable or 
the subject is lost to follow -up. 
All subjects who have been exposed to investigational product will be evaluated for AEs.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as those that occur on or after the 
date of the first dose of investigational product.  Non-treatment emergent adverse events 
(e.g., events occurring during Screening) should be recorded as medical history unless related 
to a study procedure, in which case, they should be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Eliciting Adverse Events  
Information on AEs and SAEs will be elicited at each AE assessment time point specified in 
the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1) by [CONTACT_236840] -ended question such as: 
"Since you were last asked, have you felt unwell or different from usual in any way?" The subject may report AEs spontaneously a t any time.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessing Adverse Events  
The Investigator should follow the guidelines for rating severity  of adverse events :  
Severity  Definition  
Mild  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; no disruption 
of normal activities; symptoms are transient and would not require 
medication or medical evaluation  
Moderate  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activities and treatment may be required  
Severe  Incapacitating with inability to do work or do usual activities; may require medi cal evaluation and/or treatment; the investigational 
product may have been discontinued  
It is important to note the distinctions between severe AEs and serious AEs.  Severity is a 
classification of  intensity of a specific event, whereas an SAE is an AE  that meets any of the 
regulatory specified criteria required for designation as seriousness described in 
Section  6.11.2 (e. g., a headache may be severe [interferes significantly  with subject's usual 
function] but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs). 
The Investigator will assess relationship  of the AE to the investigational drug, TRC101, 
using the following definitions .  A su spected relationship (related, probably, possibly) 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 50 of 80 between the events and the study drug means, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  If the relationship to the study drug is considered to be unlikely or not related, an alternative suspected etiology should be provided if available (e.g., concomitant medications, intercurrent illness/events). 
Relationship  Definition  Example  
Related  Causal relationship is  
certain  The temporal relationship between  drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is reasonable, there is a 
clinically compatible response  to de- challenge, 
other causes have been eliminated;  the event must 
be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure i f necessary .  
Probable  High degree of certainty  
for causal relationship  The temporal relationship between  drug exposure 
and AE onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically compatible response to dechallenge (re-challenge is not required), unlikely to be 
attributed to disease or other drugs. 
Possible  Not reasonably related  
although a causal  
relationship cannot be 
ruled out The temporal relationship between  drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is reasonable or 
unknown, de- challenge information is  either 
unknown or equivocal, could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699]. 
Unlikely  Not reasonably related  
although a causal  
relationship cannot be ruled out Disease o r other drugs provide plausible 
explanation . 
Unrelated  No possible relationship  The temporal relationship between drug exposure  
and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug is impossible . 
The Investigator will use the following categories to assess the  outcome of each AE:  
• Recovered/reso lved;  
• Not recovered/ not resolved; 
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae;  
• Fatal; or  
• Unknown. 
 
“Fatal ” should be recorded  as an outcome when the AE results in death.  If more than one AE 
is possibly related to the subject's death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the AE 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -[ADDRESS_863269] plausible cause of death.  All other 
ongoing AE/SAEs will be recorded as not recovered/not resolved at the time of death.  
Although “fatal” is usually an outcome of an event , events such as sudden death or 
unexplained death should be reported as SAEs. 
The action taken  with regard to study drug in response to each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_236841]: 
• No action taken; 
• Study drug interrupted; 
• Study drug discontinued; or 
• Not applicable (e.g., subject was not receiving study drug at the time of the AE) . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
An independent unblinded DMC  will review the safety data during the study conduct .  The 
DMC  Charter will describe the data review process  and its frequency.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording Adverse Events 
All AEs and SAEs, whether spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_236842], will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the appropriate AE eCRF 
page.  In addition, the SAE Report Form must record each SAE.  
All AEs should be recorded using the words of the subject (verbatim term) to describe the 
AE, with two exceptions: if the verbatim term is vague or ambiguous (e.g ., cramps), the 
study staff should try to obtain clarification by [CONTACT_7939] a follow-up question (e.g., What kind 
of cramps?) and record the words the subject used to clarify the event (e.g., menstrual cramps, calf muscle cramps).  
If the subject reports a gr oup of symptoms and the Investigator is comfortable with a 
unifying diagnosis, the diagnosis should be recorded (e.g., rhinopharyngitis instead of runny nose, cough, sore throat and sneezing).  If a diagnosis is recorded, signs and symptoms need not be rec orded separately.   If the Investigator is unable to report a diagnosis, symptoms 
should be recorded on the AE eCRF. 
The following information should be captured for each AE: date of onset and resolution, 
outcome, severity, seriousness, relationship to the study drug, action taken with the study 
drug and treatments administered.  Any treatment administered as a result of an AE should be recorded on the concomitant medication e CRF . 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -[ADDRESS_863270] dose of study drug should not be 
reported as AEs, but rather, as medical history, unless they are expected finding s from 
medical history that has already been reported (e.g., elevated phosphate in a patient with a history of hyperparathyroidism).  
Clinically significant new or  clinically significantly worsening a bnormal laboratory findings 
(e.g., serum  chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g., 
ECGs, vital signs) after the first dose of study drug must be recorded as AEs or SAEs .  
Abnormalities resulting in study drug discontinuation, those associated  with clinical signs or 
symptoms, or requiring treatment should be reported as AEs. 
6.11.6 Serious Adverse Events Reporting   
The Investigator has the obligation to report each SAE to Tricida ’s designee,  
, within [ADDRESS_863271] be reported by [CONTACT_644826] ( EDC ) system.   Drug Safety will receive notification of the initial SAE via 
an e- mail alert generated from the EDC system.  
If the event meets seriousness  criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC, SAE reporting 
via a paper form will be required.  Submit SAE information via paper form as described in Figure  3.  The SAE information must be entered onto the SAE e CRF as soon as the EDC 
system becomes accessible.  All SAEs should be followed until they are resolved or stabilized and all rele vant information is compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602].  Follow-up information must be handled 
in the same way and reported within the same time frame as the initial report.

Confidential   Page 54 of 80 All AEs will be evaluated on a regular basis by [CONTACT_236843]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] SAE Expedited Reporting 
For each AE  assessed by [CONTACT_236844], Tricida will 
determine  (1) if the event was unexpected  (i.e., the nature or severity is not expected from the 
information provided in the Investigator's Brochure)  and (2) if the event was a suspected 
adverse reaction.  If the event is determined  to be a serious, unexpected suspected adverse 
reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R), Tricida will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority and Investigators.  The Investigator is 
responsible for notifying his/her respective IRB/IEC. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding Treatment Allocation  
Generally, Tricida  should only report  S[LOCATION_003]Rs for which the treatment allocation of the 
subject is unblinded to the pertinent regulatory authorities.  Investigators should only receive blinded information unless unblinded information is judged necessary for safety reasons . 
When an event may be a S[LOCATION_003]R, the blind should be broken only for that specific subject.  The blind should be maintained for individuals responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study ( e.g., management, monitors and investigators) and thos e responsible for data analysis 
and interpretation of results at the conclusion of the study (e.g., biometrics personnel).  
Unblinded information should only be accessible to those who need to be involved in the 
safety reporting to pertinent regulatory authorities, IECs/IRBs , and the Medical Monitor 
(i.e., the individual performing ongoing safety evaluations during the study).

Notification Form
 within 24 hours  of receipt of information by [CONTACT_5984].  
The Investigator is also responsible for following up the pregnancy at 3 monthly intervals 
until delive
ry or termination.  Pregnancies should initially be reported in the Pregnancy 
Notification Form and sent by e-mail to the following address:   
When the outcome of the pregnancy is known, study staff will complete the Pregnancy 
Outcome Fo
rm and e- mail it to the following address:  . 
While pregnancy is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication should be 
r
ecorded as AEs or SAEs (if applicable).  Fatalities, elective or spontaneous abortions, and 
congenital abnormalities/birth defects must be reported as SAEs.

7.[ADDRESS_863274] Re-Screening  
The Investigator may repeat a failed Screening blood or urine laboratory assessment once per 
analyte during the Screening Period (including Screening 2 and Baseline Visits) if he/she 
feels the original result was unexpected (e.g., due to a lab error, etc.) .  When Screening 
laboratory values required for study eligibility are repeated, eligibility should be determined 
based on the most recent value. 
If a central laboratory eGFR value from Screening [ADDRESS_863275]’s eligibility .  For eGFR, the most recent creatinine at the 
Screening [ADDRESS_863276] recent value available from each of the three vis its 
(Screening 1, Screening 2, Day 1) should be used for eligibility determination. Re-screening of subjects who fail to meet eligibility  criteria will be allowed provided the 
Medical Monitor approves, the subject repeats the Informed Consent process and all 
Screening evaluations are repeated; a new subject identification number will be assigned each time a subject is re -screened.  
7.4 Baseline Visit ( Day 1) 
Following completion of the Screening Period, subjects who meet eligibility criteria based on the results of the Screening 1 and 2 Visits will return to the study site for the Baseline Visit on Day 1 (within 2 week s of Screening 1 Visit) for confirmatory blood bicarbonate 
measurement.  Subjects must present to the site in a fasted state.

8 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
8.1 General Considerations  
A statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will provide details of planned analyses and summary 
documents, such as tables, listings, and figures.  This section presents an overview of the 
planned analyses .  Final analyses are not limited to the summaries described herein.   If 
circumstances arise during the stu dy th at make th ese analyse s inappropria te or if  improved 
methods become ava ilable, the S AP m ay be re vised.  The SAP will describe in detail the 
plans for dealing with subjects who drop out of the study. 
Any revisions (both a lternative and additiona l methods) to the SAP, and rea sons for su ch 
revisions, will be des cribed in the fina l study report. 
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by  [CONTACT_1570] (6 g TRC101 or 
placebo) and  time point, as applicable, using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median  and 
appropriate percentiles , standard deviation, minimum, and maximum).  All categorical study 
assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_11571], as applicable, using 
frequency counts and percentages.  Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be reported for 
the efficacy estimates.  
8.2 Determination of Sample Size 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  A sample size of [ADDRESS_863285] differences between the TRC101- and placebo -treated groups.  The sample size calculation is based on the data from 
the Phase 1/2 Study TRCA-101, where 3% of placebo and 46% of TRC101 treated subjects 
had an increase in blo od bicarbonate of ≥  4 mEq/L or had blood bicarbonate in the normal 
range at Week 2.  We assume the full TRC101 treatment effect had not been reached during 
this short treatment period.  In Study TRCA-301, we expect that 50 to 55% of TRC101-
treated and 10% of placebo- treated subjects will have an increase of ≥ 4 mEq/L or have

exact test with a 0.[ADDRESS_863286] over 99% power to detect this 
difference when 90 placebo subjects and 120 TRC101 subjects are enrolled.  If the true proportion of TRC101 subjects who respond at the Week 12 Visit is indeed between 50% and 55% and if no more than 5% of subjects have missing data at Week 12, the study wil l 
have roughly 90% power to result in a 95% confidence limit with a lower bound of at least 
35% and 40%, respectively.   
Sample size calculation for the secondary efficacy endpoint will be documented in the SAP. 8.3 Analysis Populations 
Two populations will be analyzed in this study.  The SAP may define additional analysis 
set(s).  
Modified intent -
to-treat (MITT) 
analysis set:  All randomized subjects who had both baseline an d at least one post -
baseline blood bicarbonate value.  Post- baseline is defined as a blood 
bicarbonate  value obtained after the first dose of study drug.  
 
Safety analysis 
set:  
All subjects who received any amount  of study drug (TRC101 or 
placebo)  
 
8.[ADDRESS_863287] (Clopper- Pearson)  95% confidence intervals (CI)  of the percentage,  will be 
provided for all scheduled time points when summarizing categorical efficacy variables.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for all scheduled time points  when summarizing 
continuous efficacy var iables .   
Statistical significance will be declared at the 0.[ADDRESS_863288].  In order to 
control family -wise error rate, formal statistical testing  for the primary and secondary 
endpoints will be performed sequentially .  At Week 12, Fisher’s exact test will be used to 
compare the group proportions for the primary efficacy endpoint.  O nly when  the primary 
efficacy result  is statistically significant will the formal test be performed using an MMRM 
model to compare the group means at Week 12 for the secondary efficacy endpoint.

dose of study drug.  Descriptive statistics of efficacy data will be provided for all scheduled 
time points.   
8.5.2 Efficacy Endpoints 
Primary Efficacy:   
Having a CFB in blood bicarbonate ≥ 4 mEq/L or having a  blood bicarbonate in the 
normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L)  at the end of treatment  (Week  12 Visit) .  
Secondary Efficacy:  
CFB  in blood bicarbonate at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit). 
Exploratory Efficacy:  
1. CFB in the total score of the KDQOL Question 3 items (daily activities) at the end of 
treatment (Week 12 Visit). 
2. CFB in repeated  chair stand  test duration at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit). 
 
8.5.3 Efficacy Analysis   
Efficacy data will be summarized by [CONTACT_644830].   
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analysis   
The number and proportions (expressed as percentages) of subjects who are responders at 
each time point and at the end of treatment will be calculated.  Responders are defined as 
having a CFB in blood bicarbonate ≥ 4 mEq/L or having a blood bicarbonate in the normal 
range (22 to 29 mEq/L) .  The difference in proportion of responders between TRC101 and 
placebo subjects and its exact (Clopper- Pearson) 95% CI , as well as  the p -value from 
Fisher’s exact test comparing the TRC101 group and the placebo group will be reported by 
[CONTACT_7206].   The exact 95% C Is of the proportions will also be summarized by [CONTACT_224825].  A formal test for the difference  (TRC101 – placebo) in proportion (= 
0) will be conducted at Week 12 using the Fisher’s exact test.  If this formal test is 
statistically significant, a second formal test for the proportion of TRC101 responders at 
Week 12 will be conducted.

Confidential   Page 65 of 80 [IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The secondary  efficac y analysis will compare the TRC101 group with the placebo group in 
LS mean CFB in blood bicarbonate at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  The null 
hypothesis is that there is no mean difference between the TRC101 group and the placebo 
group.  The alternative hypothesis is that the means differ .  The secondary efficacy  endpoint 
will be assessed using a longitudinal mixed -effect model for repeated measures (MMRM).  
The model will include the CFB in bicarbonate as the dependent variable, treatment, time 
point (Weeks 1, 2, …, 12), and treatment by [CONTACT_644831], subject as  
a random effect, the baseline bicarbonate and baseline eGFR  as continuous covariates.  An 
unstructured covariance structure will be assumed.  The least squar es (LS) mean of CFB in 
bicarbonate, standard error of LS mean, and two -sided 95% CIs of the LS mean  from the 
mixed model will be reported by [CONTACT_432633].  The LS mean difference 
from placebo  (i.e., TRC101 – placebo) , SE of the LS mean di fference, 95% CIs of the LS 
mean difference, and p- values of the LS mean difference from the mixed model will be 
reported by [CONTACT_7206].  Only when the primary efficacy endpoint is statistically significant 
will formal testing be performed for the secondar y efficacy endpoint.  Meeting the secondary 
endpoint will be declared if the two -sided p-value at Week 12 is <0.05 and the primary 
efficacy endpoint is statistically significant.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity Analyses and Exploratory Efficacy En dpoint Analyses 
In order to evaluate the potential effect of missing data on the primary and secondary efficacy results, sensitivity analyses will be performed using multiple imputation models under a MNAR assumption for the MITT analysis set.  These analyses will be descr ibed in 
the SAP.  
The SAP will also describe the analysis methods for the exploratory efficacy endpoints.   
8.6 Safety Analysis 
Safety will be summarized by [CONTACT_644832].  The 
number and percentage of subjects with treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) classified by 
[CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT); number (%) of subjects experiencing TEAEs by [CONTACT_926], causality, seriousness and action taken with regard to study drug will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  The n umber (%) of subjects with TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment will also be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Subjects will be counted only once at each SOC and PT level of summary.  Clinical laboratory test results, vital signs and ECG findings will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_11571].  Categorical display methods (e.g., frequencies, shift tables) and plots of laboratory values over time may also be used, as appropriate.  Worsening or n ewly 
observed, clinically significant physical examination findings will be reported as adverse 
events .

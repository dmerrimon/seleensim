 III. Introduction  
A.  Background  
Pancreatic cancer is a cause of significant morbidi ty and mortality and effective treatment 
strategies are lacking.  The annual incidence of pancreas  cancer in the Un ited  States is 9 cases 
per 100,000  people.  In  2008  there  will  be  approx imately  37,680  new  cases  and 34,290 deaths 
from pancreas cancer in the [LOCATION_002] [1]. Panc reas cancer is the  fourth  leading  cause  of  
cancer-related  mortality  in  North  America.  Early systemic spread is seen in most patients with 
pancreas cancer. Eighty percent of patients  with pancreas  cancer present  with clini cal evidence  of 
distant metastases.  With currently  available  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  the  5-year  overall  survival  of patients with 
pancreas cancer is less than 5%.Treatment of patien ts with unresectable or metastatic pancreas cancer 
and good performance with the pyrimidine anti- metabolite gemcitabine results in a median overall 
survival off less than 6 months and  a  clinical  benefit  response  of  24% [2].   
Cancer related cachexia is a cause of significant m orbidity and no effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35734].  
Cachexia, a syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_179490] l oss of adipose and skeletal muscle tissue accounts 
for more than 50% of cancer related death. Patients  with cancer and cachexia have a short overall 
survival and decreased response to chemotherapy [3]. Insulin resistance is a hallmark of cancer-
associated cachexia [4] and is in part mediated by c ytok ines suc h as TNF-  [5]. Severe 
malnutrition and cachexia develops in 85% of patients with pancreas cancer during the course of 
their illness.  
Pancreatic cancer provides an excellent model to st udy cancer associated cachexia and insulin 
resistance . Up to 85% of pancreatic cancer patients will expe rience cachexia in their lifetime. In addition 
type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs in 70 to 80% of pati ents with pancreas cancer. The development of 
diabetes in patients with pancreas cancer is likely secondary to a marked decline in pancreat ic  cell 
function and profound peripheral  insulin  resistance.  Patients  with ad vanced  pancreas  cancer  
display many of the metabolic abnormalities seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus including glucose 
intolerance, increased hepatic glucose production, recycling, and insulin resistance.  
Thiazolidinediones (TZD) lead to improved insulin s ensitivity and weight gain, but effects on 
pancreatic cancer patients are unknown . Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_536661]-associated wasti ng, also 
result in increased peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity [6]. The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are a class of 
medications that produce insulin sensitizing effect s in animal models [6-9] and in insulin  resistant  
human  subjects [10-12].  The  TZDs  are high affinity ligands   for  the  nuclear   receptor,   peroxisom e   
proliferator-activated   receptor gamma  (PPAR )  which  transactivates   PPAR-responsive   gene  
promoters[13]. Some of the insulin-sensitizing properties of PPAR  agonists are thought to be mediated 
through their anti-inflammatory activity. In periph eral monocytes, peritoneal macrophages, and 
adipocytes, PPAR  agonists are reported to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines. The anti-
inflammatory activity of PPAR agonists   appears   to   be   mediated   through   inhibition   of  the   
activation   of transcription  factors such as nuclear factor- B  (NF-B),  activator protein-1 (AP-1), and 
signal transducer and activator of transcription (S TAT). Additionally, the insulin-sensitizing  effects of 
PPAR agonists may in part be related to a positive regulation  and  increase  in  serum  levels  of  
the  adipocyte-specific   secretory protein adiponectin, a mediator of systemic insulin  sensitivity  [14, 
15]. Serum levels of adiponectin  may serve as a marker for gain of i nsulin sensitivity  in patients 
treated with PPAR  agonists. Intracellular lipid accumulation in myoc ytes and hepatocytes  has been 
associated  with decreased  insulin sensitivity.  Treatment with PPAR  agonists in humans and in 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                      7 
 rodents results in significant weight gain primarily due to increased fat mass, despi[INVESTIGATOR_536662]. One possible mechanism of action of PPAR  agonists may rely on their ability to redistribute  
triglycerides  from  muscle  and  liver  towards  a dipose  tissue.  The anabolic  effects  of PPAR   
agonists  would  be highly  desirable  in patients  with metastatic  pancreas  cancer.  PPAR  agonists  
increase  systemic  insulin sensitivity, adipose mass, and significantly decrea se inflammation 
at the level of adipocytes and macrophages. The anti-inflammatory, insulin sensitizing, and 
anabolic effects of PPAR  agonists may offer an ideal approach to counter many of the 
symptoms associated with metastatic pancreas cancer . 
TZDs have been used in a number of cancer-related  settings . In a retrospective study in type II 
diabetic patients there was a 33% decreased inciden ce of lung cancer among TZD users compared 
with nonusers after adjusting for confounder interactions.  The risk for colorectal  and prostat e  
cancers  was not significantly altered [16].  TZDs have been used in the context o f liposarcomas. 
Several studies report a positive impact of a TZD regimen, demonstr ating induction of solid tumor 
differentiation by [CONTACT_536734] a .  Other studies in contrast concluded that TZDs 
are not effective anti-tumoral drugs in the treatme nt of liposarcomas [17] . Of particular interest are the 
studies in breast cancer patients. Activation of PPAR  is associated with anti-proliferative  effects on 
human breast cancer cells in preclinical studies. However, clini cal trials using PPAR  ligands in 
patients  with  treatment-refractory  metastatic  b reast  cancer  failed  to show  any clinical benefits [18]. 
In contrast to pancreatic cancers, PPAR  tends to be highly suppressed in breast cancer cells [19]  and 
as such, these cells not offer high levels of    PPAR  target  for  the  TZDs  to  act  upon.  The  
commonly  observed  up- regulation  of  PPAR   in  pancreatic  ductal  adenocarcinoma [20]  may  
predispose these cells to a high level response to the TZDs. 
Preliminary data from UT Southwestern in patients r eceiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_536663]. Among treated patients, the 
increase in adiponectin levels varied from 50% to t hree times the baseline. However this study was 
terminated due to poor accrual. Adequate follow up was not possible due to poor survival of patients, 
demonstrating selection of terminally ill patients to the protocol. Also the effect on other markers o f insulin 
resistance is not known. 
(MRI will be performed on UT Southwestern and PHHS patients ONLY) We propose to evaluate 
the use of MRI to quantitate changes in a) intratum oral fat deposition in pancreatic cancer and 
b) visceral/subcutaneous fat distribution in pancre atic cancer patients treated with pi[INVESTIGATOR_536664]. To determine intratumoral f at content, we will use a previously described 
advanced chemical shift-based gradient-echo MRI tec hnique that measures the proton density 
fat fraction (PDFF) [21]. In addition, MRI will all ow quantitative determination of body fat volume 
in the abdomen e.g. subcutaneous/visceral adipose t issue (SAT/VAT) depots, which have been 
shown to have an important role in insulin resistan ce [22, 23]. TZD therapy has shown to 
increase ‘good’ SAT and have a concomitant decrease  in ‘bad’ VAT and liver fat in patients with 
diabetes but has not been studied in patients with pancreatic cancer related weight loss.  
MRI examination will be performed on a clinical who le body system (Philips Achieva) at 3.0 
Tesla at Rogers MRI Center equipped with a dedicate d transmit/receive body coil and images 
will be interpreted by a dedicated study radiologis t,(Department of Radiology). Scan protocol 
include a preliminary localizing sequence and a 3D multi-echo spoiled gradient echo sequence, 
with scan parameters optimized for fat quantificati on as previously described [21].

 Safety Profile: Systemic and hematologic: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_536683], edema, 
anemia (lower hemoglobin levels and hematocrit due to edema), weight gain (increased fat cell 
differentiation), and/or ovulation in premenopausal, anovulatory women. The most common a dverse 
events (5%) reported to date include upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_529244], headache, sinusitis, myalgia, 
tooth disorder, aggravated diabetes mellitus, and pharyngitis.  
Gastrointestinal (GI)/Liver : Reports of hepatitis and of hepatic enzyme elevations to three or more 
times the upper limit of normal (ULN) have been rep orted with pi[INVESTIGATOR_051].  Very  rarely,  these  
reports  have  involved  hepatic  failure  with  or without  fatal  outcome,   although   causality   h as  not  
been  established.   Liver enzymes, including serum ALT, need to be evaluated in all patients at 
initiation of therapy  with  pi[INVESTIGATOR_051],  and  periodically  th ereafter.  If  ALT  >2.5X  ULN  at baseline 
or if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of act ive liver disease, pi[INVESTIGATOR_536684].  
Systemic : Like other thiazolidinediones (TZDs), pi[INVESTIGATOR_536685]-diabetic agents, including   insulin.  Fluid  retention   may  lead  to  or  
exacerbate   heart  failure. However,  in  the  context  of  pancreatic  cancer,   these  potential  issues  
seem relatively   minor.   Nevertheless,   we  will  exc lude   patients   with  a  history   of previously 
existing cardiac disease.

Rationale for the Selection of Dose and S chedule  
 
We plan to prescribe pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] 45 mg per mouth d aily, which is the maximum U. S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approved dose for the treatment   of  type   [ADDRESS_698917] a higher than usual toxicity in 
patients with pancreas cancer receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_051].  
 
IV. S chema  
This is an open label, double arm Phase 2 study. We  plan to enroll 15 patients with adenocarcinoma of 
the pancreas to this study of oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] 45 mg daily. Pat ients are allowed to continue on 
antineoplastic therapy while on this study and this  will be determined by [CONTACT_1963]. 
A control cohort of up to 10 patients will be enrol led for correlative (blood and radiological) testin g alone. 
These patients will meet all criteria set forth for  the study and follow the same study visits, but no t be 
treated with pi[INVESTIGATOR_051].  
 
V.  Hypothesis  
Prior  studies  have  shown  that  a  significant   proportion   of  patients  with metastatic pancreas 
cancer have metabolic changes consistent with insulin resistance.   Treatment   of   insulin   
resistance   in   patients   with   metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus is associat ed with 
improved outcomes and  less  morbidity.  We  propose  an  exploratory   clinical  trial  to study  as a 
primary aim, the effects of the oral inhibitor of t he peroxisome proliferator- activated   receptor   
gamma   (PPAR )   pi[INVESTIGATOR_536688].  
 
Our primary hypothesis is that patients with pancreas cancer will  have  significant  improvements  in 
markers  of insulin  resistance when treated with pi[INVESTIGATOR_051].  
 
As secondary aims, we will e v a l u a t e  c h a n g e s  in canc er related symptoms, performance status, 
and weight . W e  w i l l  a l s o  e v a l u a t e  the objective response of measurable lesions  and  the  
time  to  disease  progression   in  patients  with   pancreas cancer. MRI will be used to assess for 
changes in body fat distribution and changes in int ratumor fat content (UT Southwestern and PHHS 
patients ONLY). We will compare change in blood bio markers and MRI between the pi[INVESTIGATOR_536689].

We plan  to  enroll   fifteen   patients   with  metastatic or locally advanced pancreas cancer into a 
double arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_536693] 45 mg daily.  
Treatment will be administered for 8 weeks and then  stopped. 
Control Arm: 
Up to ten patients meeting eligibility criteria wil l be enrolled in the control arm. Patients will be treated 
per standard of care treatment at the discretion of  the treating team and will not be treated with 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]. 
 
 
Treatment arm assignment: 
Treatment arm will be assigned by [CONTACT_536737]. Given  the exploratory 
nature of this study, randomization will not be per formed.  
 
Control arm patients can include the following exam ples: 
- patient declines pi[INVESTIGATOR_536694] (Adiponectin, a hormone made b y fat cells, will 
be measured). Additional assays may be performed 
- Patient is enrolled in another clinical trial which  does not allow experimental therapy (pi[INVESTIGATOR_051])  to be given. 
The protocol of the patient’s study will be reviewe d to ensure biomarker testing (Adiponectin, a hormo ne made by 
[CONTACT_536738], will be measured) as defined in this stu dy is not specifically prohibited.  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                      12 
 - Patients enrolled after completion of the 15 stud y arm patients  
- Other patients as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_321498]-Is

Southwestern   Institutional   Review   Board  (IRB ),  the Simmons Comprehensive Cancer 
Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) or the U. S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). 
 
 
XV.  Withdrawal of Subjects  
Patients can withdraw voluntarily if they are unabl e to continue with the 
treatment or for any other reasons.  Patients will be encouraged to discuss 
withdrawal with their physician and the study team.   
Patient who withdraw voluntarily will not be followed.  
 
XVI.  Efficacy Assessments  
 
The following outcome measures are required to eval uate the safety and 
efficacy of pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]:  
 
1.  Measurement of insulin resistance biomarkers:   serum adiponectin level, 
oral glucose tolerance test, and fasting serum leve ls of glucose and 
insulin every four weeks.  
 
2.  The oral glucose tolerance test will be perform ed on the initial visit and 
every four weeks, in fasting state (at least 8 hrs) . Patients will be asked 
to drink a standard glucose solution containing 75 g of carbohydrate. 
Blood glucose will be obtained prior to the ingestion (0 hr baseline) of 
the solution, and at 120 min (2 hr) following the ingestion.  
Blood samples  are 
collected for glucose levels.  
 
3.  Documentation of weight. We will measure weight  every week in all 
patients receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_051].  (See Appendix 2)  
 
 
24 
 4. Documentation   Eastern  Oncology  Cooperative   Group  (ECOG) 
performance status. We will determine the ECOG perf ormance status 
every week in all patients receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]. (See Appendix  
1)  
 
5.  Measurement  of changes  in symptoms  and  qual ity  of life using  the 
FACT-Hep Scale, version 4. (See Appendix 4).  
 
6.  RECIST  Criteria  will be used to determine  re sponse.  At the time of 
every tumor assessment and at the time of study discontinuation, 
assignment  of  response  to  one  of  three  categ ories  will  be  made; 
complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or pr ogressive disease 
(PD). Evaluation of measurable and non-measurable l esions in 
relationship   to  the   baseline   tumor   assessm ent   will   be   used   to 
determine response as follows. 
7. MRI will quantitate changes in a) intratumoral fat deposition in 
pancreatic cancer and b) visceral/subcutaneous fat distribution in 
pancreatic cancer patients treated with pi[INVESTIGATOR_341543] e in this phase II 
study. To determine intratumoral fat content, we wi ll use a 
previously described advanced chemical shift-based gradient-echo 
MRI technique that measures the proton density fat fraction 
(PDFF) [21]. In addition, MRI will allow quantitati ve determination 
of body fat volume in the abdomen e.g. subcutaneous /visceral 
adipose tissue (SAT/VAT) depots, which have been sh own to have 
an important role in insulin resistance [22, 23].  
 
 
XVII.   Response Criteria  
 
Evaluation of Target Measurable Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
Partial  Response  (PR):  At  least  a  30%  decrease  in  the  sum  of  the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline 
sum LD.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest  sum LD recorded since 
the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as re ference the smallest sum 
LD since the treatment started.  
 
Evaluation of Non-Measurable Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
 
25 
 normalization of tumor marker level  
 
Incomplete Response/Stable  Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more 
non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance  of tumor m arker level above the 
normal limits  
 
Progressive  Disease  (PD):  Appearance  of  one  or  more  new  lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-targ et lesions.  
 
All CR or PR cases must be confirmed with follow-up  tumor assessments 
done more than [ADDRESS_698948] also meet t he criteria for CR or 
PR in relation to baseline assessments.  
 
Time to disease progression (TDP) is a secondary en dpoint of this study. 
All patients  should be followed  for disease progr ession  every month for 
the first six (6) months, then every three (3) mont hs thereafter, following 
discontinuation of study treatment until at least t wo (2) years after 
discontinuation of pi[INVESTIGATOR_051].  
 
XVIII.  Data handling and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_536725]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_536726], case report forms (CRFs), test result or iginals, all product 
accountability  records,  correspondence,  subject  informed  consent,  and  
any other documents relevant to the conduct of the study will be kept on 
file in the Simmons Clinical Research Office for at  least two (2) years after 
all investigational  use of product is discontinued .   Study documents must 
not be destroyed. A record will be kept of all subj ects considered and 
screened  for the study and subsequently  deemed in eligible.  The reason 
for ineligibility must be recorded.  
 
Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be utilized for each subject entered into 
the study. Study participants will not be identifie d by [CONTACT_536747].  Subjects will be identified  by a subje ct identification  number 
(see Section  XI). The clinical research  coordinat or  will keep the subject 
code list in a secured locked file cabinet in the S immons Clinical Research 
Office.  Additionally, all paper documents will be stored in a locked filing 
cabinet in the Clinical Research Office and all ele ctronic records must be 
stored on a HIPAA Security Rule-compliant instituti onal server.  
 
XIX. Safety Monitoring  
 
A.  Adverse Event Definition  
Adverse Events: Definitions and Reporting 
 
Adverse Events will be reported as indicated by [CONTACT_536748] (see below).    
 
[ADDRESS_698949] or unfa vorable medical occurrence in a human research 
study participant, including any abnormal sign (for  example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory 
finding), symptom, clinical event, or disease, that  occurs during the subject’s participation in the 
research, whether or not it is considered related t o the subject’s participation in the research. 
Adverse events encompass clinical, physical and psy chological harms. Adverse events occur most 
commonly in the context of biomedical research, alt hough on occasion, they can occur in the context 
of social and behavioral research. Adverse events m ay be expected or unexpected. 
Severity  
Adverse events will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE)  and version number specified in the protocol. 
Adverse events not specifically defined in the NCI CTCAE will be scored on the Adverse Event log 
according to the general guidelines provided by [CONTACT_536749].   
• Grade 1: Mild  
• Grade 2: Moderate 
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not i mmediately life threatening 
• Grade 4: Life threatening consequences 
• Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event 
 
Serious Adverse Events  
ICH Guideline E2A and the UTSW IRB define serious a dverse events as those events, occurring at 
any dose, which meets any of the following criteria :  
• Results in death   
• Immediately life-threatening  
• Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopa rdize the subject’s health and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to pre vent one of the other outcomes 
listed in this definition. 
Note: A “Serious adverse event” is by [CONTACT_536750]. Serious 
adverse events may or may not be related to the res earch project. A serious adverse event 
determination does not require the event to be rela ted to the research. That is, both events completel y 
unrelated to the condition under study and events t hat are expected in the context of the condition 
under study may be serious adverse events, independ ent of relatedness to the study itself. As 
examples, a car accident requiring overnight hospit alization would be a serious adverse event for any 
research participant; likewise, in a study investig ating end-stage cancer care, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_536727] a serious adverse event, even if the  event observed is a primary clinical endpoint of 
the study. 
 
27 
  
1.1.2 Unanticipated Problems: 
The term “unanticipated problem” is found, but not defined in the regulations for the Protection of 
Human Subjects at 45 CFR 46, and the FDA regulation s at 21 CFR 56. Guidance from the regulatory 
agencies considers unanticipated problems to includ e any incident, experience, or outcome that meets 
each  of the following criteria: 
• unexpected; and  
• related  or possibly related  to participation in the research; and  
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Follow-up  
All adverse events will be followed up according to  good medical practices.  
 
1.1.3 Reporting 
Local events requiring expedited reporting, are sub mitted to the UTSW IRB through the UTSW eIRB 
and to the SCC DSMC Coordinator.  Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_536728]; the NCI 
ADEERS, FDA Form #3500A forms, or other sponsor for ms, if applicable; and/or any other supporting 
documentation available should be forwarded to the DSMC Coordinator.  The DSMC Coordinator 
forwards the information onto the DSMC Chairman who  determines if immediate action is required.  
Follow-up eIRB reports, and all subsequent SAE docu mentation that is available are also submitted to 
the DSMC Chair who determines if further action is required.    
  
If the event occurs on a multi-institutional clinic al trial coordinated by [CONTACT_283096], the DOT 
Manager or lead coordinator ensures that all partic ipating sites are notified of the event and resulti ng 
action, according to FDA guidance for expedited rep orting. DSMC Chairperson reviews all serious 
adverse events within upon receipt from the DSMC Co ordinator.  The DSMC Chairperson determines 
whether action is required and either takes action immediately, convenes a special DSMC session 
(physical or electronic), or defers the action unti l a regularly scheduled DSMC meeting.

G. Follow-up  
All adverse events will be followed up according to  Good 
Clinical Practices.  
 
H. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The UTSW Simmons Cancer Center (SCC) Data Safety Mo nitoring Committee (DSMC) is 
responsible for monitoring data quality and patient  safety for all UTSW SCC clinical trials.  As 
part of that responsibility, the DSMC reviews all l ocal serious adverse events in real time as 
they are reported and reviews adverse events on a q uarterly basis.  The quality assurance 
activity for the Clinical Research Office provides for periodic auditing of clinical research 
documents to ensure data integrity and regulatory c ompliance.  
  
A detailed description of the Data and Safety Monit oring Plan is available in section X of the 
Clinical Research Office Operations Manual.  
 
The SCC DSMC meets quarterly and conducts annual co mprehensive reviews of ongoing clinical 
trials, for which it serves as the DSMC of record. The QAC works as part of the DSMC to conduct 
regular audits based on the level of risk. Audit fi ndings are reviewed at the next available DSMC 
meeting.  In this way, frequency of DSMC monitoring  is dependent upon the level of risk.  Risk level i s 
determined by [CONTACT_264031] a number of fac tors such as the patient population to be 
studied; adequacy of the data management system; an d procedures to ensure the safety of study 
subjects based on the associated risks of the study .  Protocol-specific DSMC plans must be consistent 
with these principles. The following examples can b e used to begin developi[INVESTIGATOR_536729].   
 
29 
  
• High risk  examples include Phase 1 studies; Phase II or III studies where the SCC is the 
DSMC; gene therapy or recombinant DNA studies; and studies in which the investigator holds 
the IND.  
 
• Moderate risk  examples include pi[INVESTIGATOR_536730] a non-FDA approved drug. 
 
• Low risk  examples include Phase II or III studies involving  FDA-approved drugs where the 
SCC DSMC is not the DSMC of record, or trials, whic h involve non-therapeutic interventions. 
 
• Exempt examples include non-interventional studies, which are exempt from audit 
requirements outlined above. 
 
Multisite Monitoring 
 
Monitoring for multi-institutional studies conducte d with SCC as the primary site and coordinating 
center are the responsibility of the DOT Clinical R esearch Manager (CRM). The CRM or designee 
monitors all sub-sites for safety and data quality.   The purpose of ongoing data monitoring at sub-sit es 
is to ensure regulatory compliance, adherence to pr otocol requirements, and patient safety.   
 
Sub-sites will be monitored no less than annually.  Monitoring on site is preferred; however, remote 
monitoring is acceptable where there is not adequat e funding for travel.  The research documentation 
for at least 5 subjects is reviewed each time a stu dy is monitored.  
  
Monitoring will include verification of source docu mentation regarding consent, patient eligibility, 
investigational treatment, drug accountability, ser ious adverse events, toxicities, and treatment 
response.  Results of data monitoring of sub-sites will be documented and the results will be made 
available to the QAC, during trial audit.   
  
SAE’s and reportable AE’s must be reported to the I RB of the institution in which they occurred, the 
SCC lead investigators, and the SCC DSMC. The DOT M anager or lead coordinator ensures that the 
PIs at all of the participating sites and the respe ctive IRBs are notified of the events and resulting  
action for events which modify the risk of the prot ocol or which otherwise meet FDA requirements for 
expedited reporting.  
 
 XX.  Data analysis and Statistical Methods  
 
A.  Study Design and Sample Size  
This is a double arm, open label, Phase II study of  pi[INVESTIGATOR_536731]. 
The primary endpoint for the sample size calculatio n is the adiponectin serum levels change after 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_13487], which is the main indic ator for insulin response improvement. We are 
interested in testing the hypothesis that pi[INVESTIGATOR_536732] 40% from 
baseline. The change of adiponectin from baseline w as defined as c=(x1-x0)/x0, where x1 is the 
adiponectin level after treatment, and x0 is the ba seline adiponectin level. So the adiponectin 
 
30 
 change is a continuous variable. The null hypothesi s is that there is no change of adiponectin 
level. (H0: c=0). The alternative hypothesis is tha t the treatment will lead to 40% change of 
adiponectin from baseline ( H1: c=0.4). Assuming th at the standard deviation of the change is 0.5, 
(i.e the standard deviation of c values across popu lation is  0.5), that a sample of 15 patients will  
provide a power of 82% at a significance level of [ADDRESS_698951] 40% changes from baseline.  This 
sample size calculation was implemented using SAS, and was reproduced using Power and 
Sample Size (PS) software. 
 
 
B.  Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Biomarkers analyses  
Statistical graphical tools will be used to illustr ate the biomarker changes over 
time.  Mean and median changes of results for gluco se tolerance test, serum 
adiponectin level test, weight changes, and ECOG pe rformance status will be 
summarized. Pre-defined cut-offs will be used to di chotomize the patients into with 
or without insulin  response  improvement which  consists changes in serum 
adiponectin levels and standard glucose tolerance t est. The insulin response 
improvement rate and 95% exact confidence interval will be calculated.  
 
Tumor response analyses 
Complete response rate, partial response rate, obje ctive response rate and 
progression rate after week [ADDRESS_698952] 95% co nfidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
Time to progression  
For a given patient, time to progression will be de fined as the number of days from 
the day of registration to the day the patient expe riences an event of disease 
progression (or death). If a patient has not experi enced  an event of disease 
progression (or death) at the time of analysis, the n the patient’s data will be 
censored at the date of the last available evaluati on. Progression-free survival will 
be summarized using the point estimate of the media n time to progression, and the 
associated 90% confidence interval. Moreover, the proportion of patients who are 
progression  free at 24 months (after entering the  study)  will  be  calculated   
and  the  90%  confidence   interval  for  this proportion will be constructed. The 
data will be presented graphically using Kaplan-Meier   plots.  Additionally,   
exploratory   analysis  may  be  performed  
including multivariate Cox regression analysis with  appropriate baseline 
characteristics as covariates.  
 
Overall survival  
For a given patient, overall survival will be defin ed  as the number  of days from 
the day of registration  to the day of the patient’ s  death. Patients who  have not 
 
[ADDRESS_698953] known to 
be alive. Overall survival will be summarized using  the point estimate o f  the median 
overall  survival  time,  and  the  associated   90% confidence interval. Moreover, 
the proportion of patients who are still alive at 
24 m o n t h s    (after e n t e r i n g    the s t u d y ) will be  c alculated   and  the  90% 
confidence interval for this proportion will be con structed. The data will be presented   
graphically  using Kaplan-Meier   plots.  Additiona lly,   exploratory  analysis may be 
performed  including  multivariate  Cox  regression   analysis with appropriate 
baseline characteristics as covariates.  
 
Correlative Analyses  
Logistic  regression  on  response  and  Cox  regre ssion  on  progression-free 
survival  will  be  explored  with  multiple  explo ratory  variables  including  the 
glucose tolerance level, serum adiponectin level, f asting serum glucose and insulin 
level, weight changes and ECOG performance. The ass ociation of response with 
other demographic baseline characteristics will be explored. 
 
MRI assessment is exploratory. 
Comparison of treatment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]) and control arm will be exploratory.  
 
Toxicity  
Toxicities   will be  categorized   using  the  NCI -CTCAE   (version 4 .0).  The 
number and severity of toxicity and side effects in cidents will be analyzed 
descriptively and summarized in tabular format.

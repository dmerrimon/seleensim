1. Introduction  Public Health Impact of Venous Thromboembolism  
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprised of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or 
pulmonary embolism (PE), affects 350,[ADDRESS_917895] shown that VTE prophylaxis is vastly underutilized in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]2,3 and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has listed 
strategies to improve VTE prevention on its top ten list for patient safety practices.4-[ADDRESS_917896] that 10 -20% of prescribed VTE prophylaxis doses are not 
administered, with the leading causing being patient refusal.11-15 In order to understand 
practice at our own institution, we conducted an exploratory study and found that nearly 
12% of prescribed doses of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis are no t administered and 
almost 60% of missed doses are due to patient or family member refusal.11 In a survey 
of 500 recently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], the National Blood Clot Alliance found that only 
28% and 15% respectively had basic knowledge of deep venous thr ombosis (DVT) or 
pulmonary embolism (PE) despi[INVESTIGATOR_75154] 15% of participants had a history and 
43% had a family history of either condition. Similarly, we found that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678282].16  
Rationale for Patient -centered Education Bundle Trial  
Given the high frequency of patient refusal of VTE prophylaxis and significant 
knowledge gaps regarding VTE, there is an urgent need to educate patients and 
families on the importance and benefits of compliance with VTE prophylaxis. As a part 
of a study funded by [CONTACT_33230] -Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), we 
first educated nurses on the harms of VTE and the benefits of prophylaxis, showing that 
this first step intervention improved VTE prophylaxis administration by [CONTACT_3450] 
10%.[ADDRESS_917897] of delivering a patient educati on 
intervention bundle on incidence of VTE prophylaxis non -administration, and on 
incidence of VTE in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].   
Primary Hypothesis: Patients on floors in the intervention arm will have a larger 
decrease in frequency of missed doses of VTE pr ophylaxis compared with patients on 
floors in the control arm.   
Secondary Hypothesis: Patients in the intervention arm will have a larger decrease in 
frequency of VTE compared with patients in the control arm.  
   
2. Study Design A. 
Study Design  
 Prospective cohort study  
  
B. Eligibility Criteria  
• All patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292839] 16 medical/surgical (non -ICU) floors who are 
prescribed pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis will be eligible for inclusion  
• INTERVENTION: All patients on the four study floors (2 medi cal floors and 2 
surgical floors) who miss at least one dose of VTE prophylaxis will be eligible 
to receive the patient education bundle intervention  
• CONTROL: Patients on the 12 control floors (8 medical floors and 4 surgical 
floors) who miss doses of VTE  prophylaxis will not receive the intervention  
• Patients who move between floors during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (Intervention  
Control or Control  Intervention) will be excluded from analysis  
  
C. Interventions  
A patient -centered education bundle was create d with input from key 
stakeholders including clinicians and patients. The bundle will be delivered 
inperson by a nurse educator. Patients may choose any one or a combination of 
components of the intervention including:   
• In-person, 1 -on-1 discussion sessio n with the nurse educator.   
• A two -page patient education paper  
  Patient education video  
  
D. Enrollment   
When a dose of VTE prophylaxis is documented by [CONTACT_678284] (eMAR), a 
realtime notification will be sent to the study team via pager and email. Upon 
receiving the alert, the nurse educator will engage the documenting bedside 
nurse to determine the cause for the missed dose. The nurse educator will then 
present the patient who mi ssed a dose of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis with 
the patient education bundle.   
  
E. Duration of Study   
The proposed intervention will be conducted over an 8 -month period (April 1, 
2015 through December 31, 2015).   
  
We will use the 6 -month period before t he intervention (October 1, 2014 through 
March 31, 2015) as the pre -implementation data period.   
  
F. Outcomes  
a. Primary Outcome measure:  VTE prophylaxis non -administration  
b. Secondary Outcome Measures:  VTE (defined by [CONTACT_596239] -12 diagnosis 
codes)  
  
G. Data Source  
Patient demographic data and VTE outcomes will be extracted from the Johns 
Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678283]. Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis 
medication administration data will be extracted directly from electronic medical 
administration reco rd (eMAR).  
  
3. Analytic methods   
  
A. Blinding  
Our biostatistician team will be blinded to floor assignment arms.  
  
B. Baseline Characteristics  
a. Comparison of both arms to ensure similarity at baseline  
b. Descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics (i.e. si mple counts and 
proportions by [CONTACT_159344])  
  
C. Analytic Plan  
Our primary hypothesis will be evaluated by [CONTACT_678285]. during the intervention period. We 
will compare this change on intervention floors vs. control floors over the same 
period.   
  
D. Multi -level mixed effects linear regression  
Due to the complexity of the multilevel structure of the data (i.e. multiple doses 
per patient across various hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], nurses and floors), multiple 
outputation will be used to reduce the levels of hierarchical structure to the floor 
level and nurs e level by [CONTACT_596240]. By 
[CONTACT_596241] 1000 times, we will estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 
95% confidence intervals conditional on the floor and nurse. For estimating 
conditional odds ratios and their confiden ce intervals, the binomial family and a 
logit link will be used, and for estimating the conditional proportions, the Poisson 
family and a log link will be used. An a priori stratified (or subgroup) analyses 
(medical vs. surgical floors) will be performed u sing the same models to assess  
the same outcomes. All analyses will be on an Intention -to-Treat basis (all doses 
and patients on each floor).

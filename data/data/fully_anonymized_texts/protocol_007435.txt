Study Phases  
The study phases are as follows.  
Screening Phase  
Up to 6 weeks to determine study eligibility.  
Open -Label Phase (Baseline to Visit OL22)  
Baseline is defined as Day 1 of the OL phase.  
• The starting dose at Baseline will be 100 mg relacorilant once daily for 2 weeks  
• From Visit OL2 through OL10, the dose of relacorilant will be increased every 4 weeks by 
100 mg, as tolerated  and based on improvement in signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome, to 
a target dose of 400 mg once daily (i.e., to 200 mg at Visit OL2, to 300 mg at Visit OL6, and to 400 mg at Visit OL10) . Clinical benefit in the Open-Label P hase will be assessed by [CONTACT_617919] a change from Baseline or change from the previous visit considering the 
following factors: 
­ BP measurements and anti -hypertensive medication  
­ Glucose levels  and diabetes medication  
­ Body weight and waist circumference 
­ Cushingoid appearance and striae  
­ Sit-to-stand test  
­ Beck Depression inventory  
­ Cushing Quality- of-Life questionnaire  
• If all symptoms of Cushing syndrome present at Baseline have resolved, no dose escalation will 
occur beyond that visit. 
• Faster dose escalation during the open -label phase of the study for patients whose Cushing 
syndrome deteriorates may be allowed with medical monitor approval. 
• If any planned dose escalation is postponed, Visit OL14 can be used for a final dose escalation  

Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | 17 May  2024 
Confidential  Page 5 of 116 • Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, dose escalation up to 200 mg may occur remotely if necessary. 
Subsequent dose escalations, however, are permitted only after completion of safety 
assessments.  
• Dose interruption, reduction, and re -escalation are permitted for safety/tolerability:  
­ The relacorilant dose can be reduced to a previous dose if it is not tolerated  
­ Re-escalation after a dose reduction is permitted until Visit OL18.  
Randomized- Withdrawal Phase (Randomization to Visit RW12)  
Patients who complete the OL phase and meet the following response criteria for DM/IGT or hypertension at Visit OL22 (see below and Section  3.6) will be randomized between Visit OL22 and 
up to 2 weeks after that visit in a 1:1 ratio to receive relacorilant or placebo for 12 weeks.  
• Patients with uncontrolled hypertension at Baseline must meet one of the following response criteria:  
­ ≥5 mm Hg decrease in mean systolic BP (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (DBP) from Baseline to 
Visit OL22, without worsening of either, based on 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring 
(ABPM)  
Note : Increase of pre-existing blood pressure medication or initiation of new blood pressure 
medication, due to worsening in hypertension, disqualifies the patient from randomization into 
the RW phase. If a decrease  in the BP medication occurred after the OL18 visit, reassess 
eligibility for randomization 4 weeks after the dose change.  
 
• Patients with DM/IGT at Baseline must meet one of the following response criteria:  
In patients with DM   
­ HbA1c has decreased by ≥0.5% from Baseline to Visit OL22  
­ The 2 -hour oGTT glucose is normalized (<140 mg/dL) or decreased by ≥50 mg/dL from 
Baseline to Visit OL22  
­ Total daily insulin dose has decreased by ≥25% and HbA1c is unchanged or decreased compared with Baseline  
In patients with IGT  
­ The 2 -hour oGTT glucose is normalized (<140 mg/dL) from Baseline to Visit OL22 
Note : Increase of pre-existing diabetes medication or initiation of new diabetes medication, due 
to worsening of hyperglycemia, disqualifies the patient from randomization into the RW phase.  
If a decrease in the insulin dose happened after the OL18 visit, reassess eligibility for 
randomization 4 weeks after the dose change. 
 
• Patients with both DM/IGT and uncontrolled hypertension at Baseline who do not meet the 
above-mentioned response criteria for both conditions must meet one of the following: 
­ Meet one of the DM or IGT response criteria with no worsening in hypertension  
­ Meet one of the uncontrolled hypertension response criteria with no worsening in DM or 
IGT 
Note : Increase of pre-existing diabetes or blood pressure medication or initiation of new 
diabetes or blood pressure medication due to worsening hyperglycemia or hypertension, 
disqualifies the patient from randomization into the RW phase. If a decrease in insulin dose or 
BP medication occurred after the Visit OL18, reassess eligibility for randomization 4 weeks 
after the dose change.

Confidential  Page 6 of 116 Treatment assignment and selected study assessments in the RW phase will remain blinded to the 
Investigators, the Sponsor, and the patients until after database lock.  
No c hanges in the dose of study drug are allowed during the RW phase. 
 
Rescue criteria during the RW Phase  
2-hour oGTT and ABPM results during the RW Phase will be reviewed by [CONTACT_617920]. The unblinded Medical Monitor is unblinded to results of study assessments but is blinded to the treatment assignment.  
• If a patient in the DM/IGT subgroup meets the first two  of the following criteria, or if a patient 
in the hypertension subgroup meets the third criterion, the results will be communicated to the 
study site, and rescue medication may be initiated or increased as per Section  5.4.2 .  
­ Fasting glucose increases by 50 mg/dL from visit OL22, AND 
­ 2-hour oGTT glucose increases by 100 mg/dL from Visit OL22 
­ Increases in mean SBP or mean DBP by [CONTACT_617921] 10 mm Hg from Visit OL22  
Unblinding of the 2- hour oGTT or ABPM results will not result in the unblinding of study treatment.  
 
In the event of rescue medication use before Visit RW12:  
• In patients randomized to the DM/IGT subgroup, oGTT assessments will continue as planned 
until Visit RW12.  
• In patients randomized to the hypertension subgroup, ABPM assessments will continue as 
planned until Visit RW12. 
Patient Disposition 
Patient Completion  
• Patients who complete [ADDRESS_820629] study  visit.  
• Patients who complete [ADDRESS_820630] study visit.  
Early Termination  
• Patients who complete the Visit OL22, but do not meet a response criterion for randomization, will be instructed to discontinue study drug. The Follow -Up visit will be conducted [ADDRESS_820631] study vis it.  
• If a patient discontinues early from the OL phase, the patient will complete an Early Termination visit at the time of last dose of study drug (or soon thereafter). The Follow- Up visit 
will be conducted [ADDRESS_820632] study visit.  
• If a patient discontinues early from the RW phase, the patient will be instructed to return for Visit RW12 per the patient’s original dosing schedule as well as the Follow-Up visit [ADDRESS_820633] dose of study drug. If RW12 is the return visit following early discontinuation from 
the RW phase, a 3 -week visit window (2 weeks before the scheduled visit, 1 week after the 
scheduled visit) for RW12 is permitted.  
• For patients who discontinue the study prior to the RW12 visit during the RW phase of the study 
and return for the RW12 visit, the follow up visit will be waived if the RW12 visit occurs at 
least [ADDRESS_820634] dose of administration of study drug.

Confidential  Page 7 of 116 Treatment Continuation  
• Patients who complete the RW phase of the study will be permitted to continue relacorilant 
treatment in an extension study provided that they have at least 80%  adherence with prescribed 
dosing (by [CONTACT_33315]), AND are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], expected to maintain clinical benefit from the study drug. Clinical benefit will be determined by [CONTACT_617922] O pen-Label Phase in the following factors: 
­ Hypertension 
­ Hyperglycemia 
­ Body weight and waist circumference 
­ Clinical appearance  
­ Sit-to-stand test  
­ Psychiatric health and cognitive function 
­ Cushing Quality- of-Life (QoL) score  
• Patients who complete the OL phase of the study, but do not meet a response criterion for 
randomization, will be permitted to continue relacorilant treatment in an extension study if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], they have benefitted from the study drug and are expected to 
maintain that benefit as noted above . The same adherence rule applies.  
• Patients who continue on to the extension study within [ADDRESS_820635] study visit for these patients will be 
either the Visit OL22 (if criterion for randomization is not met) or Visit RW12 (if the RW phase 
was completed).  
Study Enrollment  
Study enrollment will be monitored to ensure attainment of randomization targets. The number of 
patients enrolled in the OL phase may be adjusted to ensure a sufficient number of patients meeting 
response criteria to uncontrolled hypertension are randomized in the RW phase. Enrollment of patients 
may continue based on enrollment target projections.  
Study Endpoints  
Endpoints for both OL and RW phases are listed below. In the RW phase, (1) endpoints related to hypertension will be analyzed in those patients who met any response criterion for hypertension at Visit OL22; and (2) endpoints related to DM/IGT  will be analyzed in those patients who met any 
response criterion for DM/IGT  at Visit OL22. 
Primary Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed in the RW phase:  
• In patients with hypertension, the proportion of patients with a loss of response with respect to hypertension from Visit OL22 to RW12 based on 24-hour ABPM as compared between 
relacorilant and placebo  arms , where loss of response is defined as follows: 
­ In patients who met only the SBP response criterion, an increase in SBP ≥5 mm  Hg.  
­ In patients who met only the DBP response criterion, an increase in DBP by ≥5 mm Hg.  
­ In patients who met both the SBP and DPB response criteria, an increase in either SBP or 
DBP by ≥5 mm Hg.  
­ Any increase or modification in antihypertensive medication due to worsening hypertension. 
­ Patients discontinue treatment in RW phase for any reason . 
• In all patients , assessment of safety based on treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) .

Investigational Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
The study drug will be administered orally and once daily, as capsules containing 100 mg of 
relacorilant (or matching placebo, as applicable).   
The starting dose at Baseline will be 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks. 
During dose escalation, all patients will be escalated in a stepwise manner from 100 mg to 400  mg 
once daily, based on tolerability and improvement in hypertension and/or hyperglycemia . The starting 
dose at Baseline will be 100 mg relacorilant once daily for 2 weeks, after which the dose will be 
increased to 200 mg. Then the dose will increase in 100 mg increments every 4 weeks. Dose escalation 
will be performed based on tolerability considering the following factors (only in patients whose 
current dose is well tolerated).  
In patients with hypertension only, the mean 24-hour BP (based on ABPM): 
• SBP is ≥130 mm Hg or  
• SBP is <130 mm Hg and has not decreased by ≥5 mm Hg from Baseline.  
• DBP is ≥80 mm Hg or  
• DBP is <80 mm Hg and has not decreased by ≥5 mm Hg from Baseline.  
In patients with DM/IGT only, the 2-hour glucose based on oGTT: 
Note: For visit OL2, the fasting glucose assessment from the c hemistry lab oratory  panel will  be 
used for dose escalation purposes.  
• is ≥140 mg/dL or fasting glucose is >100 mg/dL or

• Dose escalation may be held if the patient cannot safely tolerate escalation to the next  dose.  
• Faster dose escalation for patients whose Cushing syndrome deteriorates during the study may 
be allowed on a case-by- case basis after discussion and approval by [CONTACT_7195].  
• If any planned dose escalation is postponed, Visit OL14 can be used for a final dose escalation. 
• If access of patients to the study site is restricted due to the COVID -19 pandemic, dose 
escalation up to 200 mg may occur remotely if necessary. Subsequent dose escalations, 
however, are permitted only after completion of safety assessments.  
• Dose escalations start the day after the Visit at which they are approved by [CONTACT_737].  
• After normalization of hypertension and/or hyperglycemia, further dose escalation will be 
allowed considering the following factors:  
­ Body weight and waist circumference  
­ Cushingoid appearance and striae  
­ Sit-to-stand test  
­ Beck Depression inventory  
­ Cushing Quality -of-Life questionnaire  
• If all symptoms of Cushing syndrome present at Baseline have resolved, no dose escalation will 
occur beyond that visit. 
Pharmacokinetics  
Blood concentrations of relacorilant will be measured and PK examined in all patients at Visit OL1 8.  
Statistical Methods  
Analysis Populations 
The ITT- RW population will include all patients who were randomized in the double -blind RW phase 
and received at least one dose of study drug. The mITT -RW population will include all patients in the 
ITT-RW population with at least one post -randomization efficacy assessment for primary efficacy 
endpoint (ABPM) .  
The per-protocol analysis population (PP- RW)  will include all patients in the mITT -RW population 
who had no major protocol deviations that might impact the validity of the primary efficacy analysis. 
The ITT- RW population will be used for the analysis of the primary endpoint in the RW Phase. The 
mITT -RW and PP-RW populations will be used for supportive efficacy analyses of all endpoints in the 
RW Phase.  
The ITT- OL population will include all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of study drug. 
The mITT- OL population will include all patients in the ITT -OL population with at least one post -
baseline efficacy assessment for secondary efficacy endpoint s. The per -protocol analysis (PP-OL) 
population will include all patients in the mITT -OL population who had no major protocol deviations 
that might impact the validity of the primary efficacy analysis.  The ITT- OL, mITT-OL, and PP- OL 
populations will be used for supportive efficacy analyses of all endpoints in the OL Phase.  
The safety population will consist of all enrolled patients who received at least 1  dose of study drug.

a positive outcome if the primary endpoint reaches statistical significance.  
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint   
For the hypertension subgroup of the ITT -RW population, the primary analysis will be a responder 
analysis and the odds ratio for loss of response in hypertension control will be reported, as well as the 
percentage of patients with loss of response and 95% CI (using Clopper -Pearson method) . The loss of 
response with respect to hypertension will be compared between treatment and placebo arms at Visit RW12 using a logistic regression model with 2 independent variables (treatment arm and stratification 
factor).  In the hypertension subgroup, this stratification factor identifies patients with or without 
DM/ IGT.  
In the hypertension subgroup, loss of response in the RW phase is defined as: use of rescue medicatio n 
for hypertension  after randomization but  before Visit RW12, discontinu ation of treatment  before Visit 
RW12 , or increase in SBP/DBP of >[ADDRESS_820646] to hypertension at Visit RW12 in the hypertension subgroup of the ITT -RW population. 
Sensitivity analyses will  be pre-specified in the SAP. 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints in the RW  Phase 
For continuous endpoints in the RW phase of the study the analysis will be performed using a linear MMRM model . Restricted maximum -likelihood (REML) estimation will be used. The MMRM model 
will include Visit OL22 value (for the respective endpoint) as a covariate; treatment, visit, treatment by 
[CONTACT_23259], and stratification factor as fixed effects; patients within treatment groups as random effects. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model within-patient error, and the 
Kenwa rd-Roger approximation will be used to model denominator degrees of freedom. This model is 
used after imputation of missing data at Visit RW12, using the retrieved drop- out approach. If fewer 
than 10 retrieved dropouts are available for the endpoint, then the main analysis will use a wash -out 
multiple imputation method instead of the retrieved dropout approach.  
The analysis for each of the endpoints will determine whether there is a difference between treatment 
groups in terms of change from Randomization to Visit RW12. This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_617925].  Additional details 
will be described in the SAP.   
For all endpoints described as proportions in the RW phase, the point estimate and the 2- sided 95%  CI 
will be calculated.  
Sensitivity analyses will  be pre-specified in the SAP. 
Safety Analyses  
TEAEs are defined as AEs that start or worsen after the first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_820647] dose of study drug. 
TEAEs will be displayed using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system 
organ class and preferred term, as well as by [CONTACT_617926].  
TEAEs will be summarized separately in the following four categories: Overall TEAEs, TEAEs that 
start prior to Randomization, TEAEs that start after randomization through the end of RW phase, 
TEAEs by [CONTACT_1570], and TEAEs that start during the follow -up period by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | [ADDRESS_820648] results (chemistry and hematology), vital sign measurements, and ECG 
interval results will be summarized as changes over the OL phase and RW phase by [CONTACT_617927]. Changes in the laboratory results during the follow -up period will be 
summarized separately.  
Sample Size  
Approximately [ADDRESS_820649] of approximately 25% with DM/IGT only, 
25% with hypertension only, and 50% with both DM/IGT and hypertension at Screening. Attainment 
of the randomization targets within the hypertension subgroup in the RW phase further assumes that 
75% of patients  that present with hypertension only  randomize to the RW phase and 20% of patients 
that present with both comorbidities ( DM/IGT and hypertension) respond to hypertension criteria at 
Visit OL22 and random ize to the RW phase. With these assumptions, a total of approximately 46 
patients meeting response criteria will be randomized into the hypertension subgroup  of the ITT -RW 
analysis population. Forty -six patients with hypertension (23 per treatment group) will ensure at least 
90% power to detect the difference between placebo and treatment arms in loss of response (assuming a loss of response in 25%  of patients in the treatment arm and 75% in the placebo arm). These 
calculations are based on a Fisher’s exact  test of proportions at the alpha =0.05 two- sided significance 
level .

commonly caused by [CONTACT_617928] (ACTH)-secreting pi[INVESTIGATOR_46608] (Cushing disease). Other forms of Cushing syndrome result from autonomous production of 
cortisol from adrenal cortical tumors or overproduction of ACTH from non- pi[INVESTIGATOR_44079] 
(ectopic ACTH syndrome). 
The only curative treatment is resection of the tumor cause of the excess cortisol. Depending on 
the nature of the underlying tumor (i.e., benign versus malignant, localized versus metastatic), 
the selected treatment may be surgery, radiotherapy, medical therapy, or a combination of these. 
Pharmacological treatment serves to control the disease after unsuccessful surgery or recurrence 
(Nieman et al. 2015 ). It may also be used to lower cortisol activity to improve a patient’s 
condition prior to surgery and is employed as interim therapy under specific circumstances, such 
as in patients waiting for radiotherapy to be effective ( Cuevas -Ramos 2014).  
Currently, there are four [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 
medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_617901]. The first, mifepristone (Korlym
®), was  
approved for the control of diabetes  mellitus /impaired glucose tolerance ( DM/IGT ) secondary to 
hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome who have DM/IGT  and 
have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. The second, pasireotide (Signifor®), is a 
somatostatin receptor agonist approved for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing disease 
for whom pi[INVESTIGATOR_585639]. The third, osilodrostat 
(Isturisa®) is a cortisol-synthesis inhibitor approved for the treatment of adult patients with 
Cushing’s disease for whom pi[INVESTIGATOR_585639].  The 
fourth, levoketoconazole (Recorlev®), is a cortisol synthesis inhibitor indicated for the treatment 
of endogenous hypercortisolemia in adult patients with Cushing syndrome for whom surgery is not an option or has not been curative. 
Relacorilant (CORT125134) is a potent, selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist being 
developed for the treatment of Cushing syndrome. Relacorilant is a high-affinity antagonist of the GR (inhibition constant <1 nM in a human GR binding assay and <10  nM in a human 
functional assay). Although the mechanism of action of relacorilant is similar to that of mifepristone, relacorilant does not bind to the progesterone receptor (PR). Given its selective and potent GR antagonism, relacorilant has the potential advantage compared with mifepristone of 
not having any antiprogesterone effects, including endometrial hypertrophy and the potential for 
irregular vaginal bleeding. 
1.2 Clinical Summary  
A brief summary of relacorilant clinical studies is presented. Further details on the studies, 
design, and results are presented in the Investigator’s Brochure.

500 mg or repeated doses of up to 250 mg daily (“clinical-pharmacology” formulation, an earlier formulation with a higher bioavailability than the current “clinical- trial formulation”).  
Pharmacodynamic data were generated following administration of prednisone alone and in combination with relacorilant. Single doses of 500 m g of relacorilant or multiple doses 
of 250 mg daily prevented changes in lymphocytes, eosinophils, and osteocalcin induced by

there was a dose- related trend in subjects who reported at least 1 treatment- emergent adverse 
event ( TEAE ): 44.4% (50 mg), 66.7% ( 150 mg), and 85.7% (250 mg), compared with 50% of 
placebo -treated subjects. The most commonly reported TEAEs were within the system organ 
class musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. At a relacori lant dose of 500 mg once 
daily , 77.8% of subjects of in the [ADDRESS_820666] one moderate or severe TEAE, 
compared with <22.5% in the groups receiving placebo and lower relacorilant doses. This 
500 mg dose level (with the higher bioavailability formulation) was terminated prematurely due to lack of tolerability . No serious AEs were reported  in this group.  
A Phase 1 multiple -ascending -dose study was conducted to characterize the steady -state PK of 
and determine the exposure range of the clinical -trial formulation following administration of 
daily doses of 150 mg, 250 mg, or 350 mg for 14 consecutive days in healthy subjects (n=32) (Study CORT125134-453). Consistent with historical data, relacorilant exposure increased in a time-dependent and greater than dose-proportional manner. All subjects achieved steady -state 
conditions by [CONTACT_2006] 14, and all subjects had a steady -state exposure (Day 14 area under the 
concentration -time curve from 0 to 24 hours postdose, AUC
0-24h) that was less than the 
40 µg•h/mL exposure limit guided by [CONTACT_617930]. Relacorilant was well 
tolerated in all subjects at all dose levels. No serious or severe TEAEs have been reported.  One 
subject receiving relacorilant 250 mg withdrew consent and discontinued the study due to a 
related TEAE of moderate dyspepsia. Additionally, the PK data from Study CORT125134-453 
indicate that the relacorilant exposure in healthy subjects is similar to that observed in patients 
with endogenous Cushing syndrome at the same dose level in Study CORT125134-451. 
A Phase 1 human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study was 
conducted in healthy subjects to assess the mass balance recovery, pharmacokinetics ( PK), 
metabolite profile and elimination of relacorilant.  The major components in human plasma were 
CORT125336 (both diastereoisomers), metabolite m/z411, CORT125337 (first diastereoisomer), parent relacorilant, and metabolite CORT125295. Relacorilant represented 38% of the 
circulating radioactivity based on maximum plasma concentration ( C
max) and 6.2% based on 
AUC at the last quantifiable time point ( AUC last) and suggests rapid metabolism of relacorilant. 
The mean half -life ( t1/2) of relacorilant was 23.1 hours . A single dose of [14C]-relacorilant was 
well tolerated , no severe or serious TEAEs were reported , and no subject was withdrawn as a 
result of a TEAE. The mass balance recovery of total radioactivity did not differ between male and female subjects.  
The effect of food on a single dose of relacorilant (350 mg) was evaluated clinically (Study CORT125134-123; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in healthy subjects following administration of relacorilant 
(clinical -trial formulation) with a high- fat meal or with a standard, moderate - fat meal, relative to 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | 17 May  2024 
Confidential  Page 29 of 116 fasting conditions. The exposure (AUC) of relacorilant increased approximately 2 -fold on 
administration under fed conditions, relative to fasting conditions. The increase in relacorilant 
exposure was similar with both meal types. A serious adverse event (SAE; pulmonary embolism) 
occurred in [ADDRESS_820667] of relacorilant as a perpetrator of cytochrome P450 ( CYP )-mediated drug-
drug interactions (DDI) was evaluated clinically ( Study CORT125134-126; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Healthy subjects received single oral doses of the probe substrates midazolam (CYP3A), 
metoprolol (CYP2D6), pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (CYP2C8), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), and omeprazole 
(CYP219) in the presence or absence of steady -state concentrations of relacorilant (350 mg 
once- daily; clinical- trial formulation ). Following single-dose administration of probe substrates 
of CYP activity in the presence of steady -state concentrations of relacorilant, no relevant effect 
of relacorilant was observed on CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, However, relacorilant was shown to be a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulting in midazolam AUC extrapolated to infinity 
(AUC
inf) and C max of 8.8-fold and 3.3-fold higher, respectively, relative to midazolam alone ; 
additional guidance is provided in Section  5.4.4. One subject discontinued due to an AE of 
pancreatitis, acute, Grade 3 (severe), not serious, not related to either relacorilant or probe substrates. No other treatment -related adverse events ( TEAEs ) led to withdrawal of study drug, 
study-drug interruption, or reduction of dose. 
The effect of a strong inhibitor of CYP3A on a single dose of relacorilant was evaluated in 
healthy subjects (Study CORT125134-124; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], Part 1). Following coadministration 
of a single dose of relacorilant (350 mg; clinical- trial formulation ) with itraconazole (200 mg), 
relacorilant AUC
inf and C max were 3.[ADDRESS_820668] of a strong CYP3A inhibitor on steady- state concentrations of relacorilant.  Because relacorilant is a strong 
CYP3A inhibitor as well as a CYP3A substrate, it undergoes autoinhibition, and the addition of another strong CYP3A inhibitor is not expected to result in a substantial DDI . 
Study CORT125134-451 (Study of the Safety and Efficacy of CORT125134 in the Treatment of 
Endogenous Cushing’s Syndrome; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, dose-
escalation study in patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome. The study is ongoing, dosing has completed, CSR is under preparation. Group 1 (n=17) had a two- step dose escalation 
(monthly) of once- daily relacorilant (dose range, 100 –200 mg, clinical- trial formulation; total 
treatment period, 12 weeks), and Group 2 (n=18) had a three-step dose escalation (monthly) of once-daily relacorilant (dose range, 250–400 mg, clinical- trial formulation; total treatment 
period, 16 weeks).  
Applying the response criteria selected for  this Phase 3  study ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) to the data from 
Study 451, among patients with hyperglycemia, 15 % of patients in Group 1 and 50% percent of 
patients in Group 2 responded. Among patients with hypertension, 41.7% of patients in Group 1 and 63.7% of patients in Group 2 responded.  
Of the 17 patients enrolled in Group 1, all but 1 patient completed the study. A total of 
101 TEAEs were reported, with 88.2% of patients reporting at least one. The majority of patients 
(70.6%) experienced events that were considered related to relacorila nt. The most common 
TEAEs in Group 1 were back pain, pain in extremity, diarrhea, and headache, each with 23.5% 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | [ADDRESS_820669] who discontinued.  
Of the 18 patients enrolled in Group 2, 8 (44.4%) completed the study, 13 patients (72.2%) 
completed Week 12. In Group 2, [ADDRESS_820670] 
one TEAE. The majority of patients (83.3%) experienced events considered related to 
relacorilant. The most common TEAEs in Group 2 were back pain (38.9%), nausea and 
headache (27.8 %), and arthralgia, dizziness, myalgia , abdominal pain, pain in extremity,  
dyspepsia (22.2% each).  
Eight patients in Group 2 had TEAEs that led to study-drug discontinuation, including 3 patients 
with TESAEs  and 5 patients with nonserious TEAEs (musculoskel etal AEs for 3  patients and  
peripheral neuropathy and abnormal glucocorticoids for 1  patient each). All events that  led to 
study-drug discontinuation in Group 2 were considered related to study drug with the exception of one TEAE of neck pain. The musculoskeletal TEAEs improved with dose decreases, but returned on dose re-escalation. In those patients, decrease of the dose of relacorilant improved the adverse events.  
For the entire study, five TESAEs were reported in 4  patients. All TESAEs were Grade 3 in 
severity. Three patients (8.57%) had TESAEs (polyneuropathy, myopathy, and acute myocardial infarction) that were considered related to study drug and led to study-drug discontinuation. 
Relacorilant exposure in patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome (Study CORT125134-451) 
remained well below the 40 µg∙h/mL cap (exposure limit guided by [CONTACT_617930]) at doses up to 400 mg. 
1.3 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Regimen   
1.3.1 Rationale for Study Design  
The activity of relacorilant has been demonstrated in various in vitro assays, and relacorilant was 
shown to be well tolerated in several clinical studies. The combination of the preclinical and 
clinical findings supports the continued evaluation of relacorilant in patients with Cushing 
syndrome. 
The study design includes an open- label (OL) phase, followed by a 12 -week, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo- controlled withdrawal phase. Only patients meeting response criteria at the 
end of the OL  phase will be eligible for the randomized -withdrawal (RW) phase. An RW  design 
provides predictive enrichment for the comparison of active treatment to placebo.  
The OL  phase for the determination of responders (i.e., the population to be randomized ) has two 
precedents:  First, mifepristone, another GR antagonist, was approved following an OL  study that 
demonstrated clinical improvement in glucose control of individual patients, using each patient 
as his or her own control. Second , the Phase 2 study of relacorilant (Study CORT125134-451) 
demonstrated clinical improvement in glucose control as well as in hypertension. 
The use of an OL phase followed by a placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal phase has been 
used in two  clinical trials in this indication  (i.e., studies of levoketoconazole and LCI699). 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | [ADDRESS_820671] their baseline status. Increases in antidiabetic or 
antihypertensive medications are allowed during the RW phase if neede d (Section  5.4.2).  
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of GR antagonism by [CONTACT_44114] , with an 
emphasis on blood pressure ( BP) control, in patients with  endogenous Cushing syndrome. To 
examine the many manifestations of Cushing syndrome in the study patients, several other 
efficacy assessments will be used to assess clinical benefit, including the use of antidiabetic 
and/or antihypertensive medications, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and  body- fat composition. 
Clinical benefit will also be assessed according to the exploratory efficacy endpoints detailed in 
Section  3.6. 
This design of this study accounts for relevant US FDA  regulatory guidance and will be 
conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and the applicable regulatory requirements.  
1.3.2 Rationale for Dose Selection and Regimen 
Dose selection for this study was based on PK and safety  results from Phase 1 studies in healthy 
subjects (CORT125134-120, CORT125134-123, and CORT125134-453) and safety, efficacy , 
and PK results in a Phase 2 study in patients with Cushing syndrome (CORT125134-451). 
Across all of these studies, exposure to relacorilant (as AUC
0-24h) at steady -state was well below 
40 µg·h/mL and was consistent between healthy subjects and patients with Cushing syndrome. 
The PK of relacorilant support daily dosing. 
In the Phase 2, open-label, multicenter Study CORT125134-451, 35 patients with endogenous 
Cushing syndrome received  relacorilant in  escalating  doses ranging from 100 mg/day to 
200 mg/day (Group 1, 12 weeks) and ranging from 250 mg/day to 400 mg/day (Group 2, 
16 weeks ). Preliminary results indicate that treatment with relacorilant in patients with 
endogenous Cushing syndrome results in improved glycemic and hypertension control. 
In Group 1, clinically significant changes in DM/IGT  and hypertension control were generally 
observed starting with the 200-mg dose , which was well tolerated . In Group 2, a higher 
proportion of patients responded based on the Phase 3 response criteria ( Section  1.2), but also 
a higher proportion experienced TEAEs (especially musculoskeletal complaints) and/or 
discontinued study. 
The Phase [ADDRESS_820672] responders will achieve clinical benefit along with good 
tolerability at a  relacorilant dose of 200 mg or 300 mg daily, but that some patients (analogous to 
experience with the predecessor drug, mifepristone), will require higher doses. Based on these safety, efficacy , and PK considerations, the dose range for the examination of both safety and 
efficacy in the protocol is 200‒[ADDRESS_820673] tolerate a gradual dose escalation. The 
exposures in the patients with Cushing syndrome receiving 200 mg (in Group 1) and patients receiving 250 mg were similar. However, patients in Group 2, who started dosing with 250 mg 
relacorilant, experienced TEAEs (especially musculoskeletal symptoms) at a higher frequency 
and with greater intensity compared with patients who received 200 mg after a slow titration starting from 100 mg daily. Therefore, to maximiz e treatment persistence, patients in this 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | [ADDRESS_820674] 2 weeks of dosing before escalating 
to 200 mg daily and continuing with subsequent dose escalations to a target dose of 400 mg once 
daily, as tolerated.   
1.4 Rationale for Selection of Primary Endpoint 
Due to the mechanism of action of relacorilant ( a GR antagonist), cortisol levels  cannot be used 
as a primary endpoint as  they are in studies of steroidogenesis or ACTH secretion inhibitors. 
Therefore, clinical endpoints must be used, as in the case of  the marketed drug,  mifepristone 
(Korlym®). The primary indicator of clinical response in this protocol is  improvement in 
hypertension, which is a very  common manifestation of Cushing syndrome and for which there 
are robust, objective measures. In this protocol,  the response criteria for BP control and  for blood 
glucose control determine the  selection of patients who will enter the placebo -controlled portion 
of the study.  
For hypertension control, the protocol employs 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 
(ABPM), the gold- standard measurement.  For this test, a decrease of 5 mm  Hg in either systolic 
or diastolic BP  is clinically significant, and this is the BP  response criterion . Unlike the 
predecessor drug, mifepristone, relacorilant has not caused  significant increases in cortisol levels  
in Phase 2 patients with Cushing syndrome. Therefore, relacorilant does not pose any concern 
that improvement in BP  due to general improvement in Cushing syndrome could be offset by 
[CONTACT_617931]  (which increases BP ). Thus, the 
improvements in hypertension seen in the Phase 2 study are expected to be confirmed in this Phase 3  study.  
For the RW phase, the criterion  for loss of response in regards to HTN control is the same (but 
reverse) as for response in the OL phase of the study—an increase of 5 mm Hg or greater. For 
blood pressure, a responder analysis is preferred due to absence of a single parameter that 
incorporates both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). 
1.5 Rationale for Selection Criteria for Patients Eligible in the Randomized Withdrawal 
Phase  
Selection of patients eligible for randomiz ation  in the RW phase is based on the improvement of 
common comorbidities observed in patients with Cushing syndrome, hypertension, or 
hyperglycemia. Hypertension response criteria are described in Section  1.4. 
For glucose control, the evaluation of clinical benefit depends on the circumstances at Baseline. 
The response criteria in this protocol are based on 1) decreases in HbA1c, 2) decreases in the 
2-hour glucose level in the oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), and 3) reduction in diabetes medication and are intended to encompass the range of clinically significant improvements seen in patients experiencing better control of their hyperglycemia. 
For any patient with hyperglycemia, a reduction in HbA1c of ≥0.5% is clinically significant 
(Prandin 2017; Starlix 2018; Gerich 2013; Esposito et al. 2004; EMA/CHMP 2014; Castinetti et 
al. 2014). For patients with lesser degrees of hyperglycemia, improvements may not be reflected in changes in HbA1c (which is less sensitive below a starting point of 6.5%), but will be evident from the oGTT. The 2-hour oGTT glucose level has been used as an endpoint in several trials 
with diabetes drugs ( Prandin 2017; Starlix 2018; Gerich 2013; Esposito et al. 2004). In these 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | 17 May  2024 
Confidential  Page 33 of 116 studies, a change in the 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) by 50 mg/dL was associated with a 
clinically meaningful improvement in the HbA1c, and this change is regarded by [CONTACT_617932]. Finally, a substantial reduction in diabetes medication —a 25% 
reduction in total daily insulin dose triggered by [CONTACT_617933] a patient to prevent future hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_617902]1c represents a significant clinical benefit. 
1.6 Benefit s and Risks 
Glucocorticoid receptor antagonism is a proven mechanism of action for the treatment of the 
DM/IGT  secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with Cushing syndrome ( Fleseriu et al . 
2012).  Because the mechanism of action of relacorilant is similar to that of mifepristone, with the 
exception that it does not bind the PR , relacorilant is expected to effectively  treat  Cushing 
syndrome, but without the drawbacks of progesterone receptor antagonism that may result in untoward reproductive effects and/or interruption of therapy. 
In the Phase 2 study (Study CORT125134-451) in patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome, 
relacorilant showed evidence of clinical benefit based on improvement of cortisol- excess ‒related 
comorbidities. The drug was generally well tolerated, with the upper bound on dosing being typi[INVESTIGATOR_617903], a tolerability issue that patients can report. 
Compared with the predecessor drug mifepristone, relacorilant offers two  key safety advantages: 
lack of affinity for the PR, and lack of significant cortisol rise (a driver of hypokalemia in the 
marketed GR antagonist mifepristone). 
Based on the mechanism of action of relacorilant, there is a theoretical risk of excessive GR 
antagonism, which could manifest by [CONTACT_44107], tiredness, dizziness, hypoglycemia, dehydration, 
weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle aches. Since relacorilant does not a ffect the 
mineralocorticoid receptor, it is unlikely that hypotension would occur in the absence of 
antihypertensive medication. Because plasma glucocorticoid levels are not decreased with 
relacorilant administration, a biochemical dia gnosis of excessive GR antagonism is not possible; 
diagnosis must rely on clinical assessment. In cases of suspected excess GR antagonism, study 
drug will be interrupted for 3 days and supplemental glucocorticoid will be given in high doses to overcome the GR antagonism ( Table 2).  
The safety profile of relacorilant in study patients  will be monitored by [CONTACT_2695], physical 
examinations, measurement of vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and blood tests for analysis of clinical chemistry and hematology parameters.  
Patients meeting response criteria will be randomized 1:1 to continue relacorilant or receive a 
placebo  equivalent  (i.e., have relacorilant withdrawn). Pa tients proceeding into the RW phase 
will be at risk for relapse of symptoms of Cushing syndrome, including worsening of diabetes, hypertension, and weight gain. 
In vitro data indicate that relacorilant is metabolized by [CONTACT_44108] (CYP3A4, 
CYP2C8, and CYP3A5) and by [CONTACT_44109]. D ata also indicate the potential for 
relacorilant to perpetuate  drug-drug interactions via inhibition of CYP3A and transporter 
pathways. Patients  taking any prohibited medication are excluded from this study (refer to 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | 17 May  2024 
Confidential  Page 34 of 116 Section  5.4). If a concomitant medication is required to treat an AE, in selecting the appropria te 
concomitant medication, the Investigator must consider the risk of drug-drug interaction. The 
Medical Monitor must approve all concomitant medications required to treat an AE if there is a potential for drug-drug interaction. If necessary, the patient will be withdrawn from the study. 
Study procedures include venous blood sampling and noninvasive procedures, including ECG recording, imaging, and vital-sign measurement. During cannulation, more than 1 attempt may 
be needed to insert the cannula in a vein of a patient, and it is possible that bruising and/or 
inflammation may be experienced at the site of cannulation. The total volume of blood collected 
will not exceed 850 mL unless  the Investigator or designee considers additional unplanned 
collection(s) are required for safety laboratory tests.  
More information on the risks and benefits of relacorilant is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

• Whether the limitations imposed by [CONTACT_25963] -19 public health emergency on protocol 
implementation pose new safety risks to trial participants, and whether it is feasible to 
mitigate these risks by [CONTACT_44106]/or procedures. 
• Whether there will be continued availability of the clinical investigator/sub -investigators 
to provide oversight of the trial, and properly assess and manage safety issues that may emerge.  
• Whether there will be sufficient trial support staff given the evolving COVID-[ADDRESS_820678] adequate equipment and materials.  
• Whether clinical investigator sites will remain open to trial participants for required in  
person assessments or whether the clinical investigator has the ability to provide required in-person assessments at an acceptable alternate location(s), or whether such protocol -
specified in -person assessments can instead be conducted virtually. 
• Whether there is continued supply of the investigational product and/or trial supplies 
essential to maintaining appropriate safety monitoring or other key trial procedures for 
trial participants.  
• Whether there is continued availability of, and support for, information technology systems and any other technological tools needed to support the trial. 
• Whether there will be continued operations of, and adequate communications with, IRB/EC, if applicable, to support trial needs. 
• Whether it is feasible to conduct the trial in light of any COVID -19 public health 
measures implemented by [CONTACT_4496]/Government, state, and/or local authorities to control the virus. 
Depending on the specific situation, additional assessments may be added. Study participants 
will be informed of changes to the study and monitoring plans that could affect them. Processes 
for remote monitoring will include the protection of trial participant data privacy and confidentiality . Study participants may choose not to participate in this study or may leave this

Patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome are immunocompromised due to a direct 
suppressive effect of high cortisol on the bone marrow and immune cells, as well as due to an effect on the immune system of the cortisol- excess‒related comorbidities (e.g., di abetes, 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | 17 May  2024 
Confidential  Page 36 of 116 hypertension, obesity). Patients with Cushing syndrome who remain untreated are at high risk 
for infections from common and uncommon pathogens. Infection is the second most common 
cause of death among patients with overt Cushing syndrome ( Dekkers et al. 2013) and in 
patients  with milder forms of hypercortisolism due to cortisol- secreting adrenal adenomas 
(Debono et al. 2014 ). In Study CORT125134-451, in which patients with endogenous Cushing 
syndrome were treated with relacorilant, in the high-dose group, we observed an overall increase in the number of lymphocytes (which is often suppressed in this patient population).  
In addition, should a patient in the study become infected with COVID-19, the Investigator 
should consult the Medical Monitor regarding any possible interactions of relacorilant with the 
various treatment options.

The study phases are as follows: 
3.1.1 Screening  Phase   
Up to 6 weeks to determine study eligibility.  
3.1.2 Open -Label Phase (Baseline to Visit OL22) 
Baseline is  defined as Day 1 of the OL phase. 
• The starting dose at Baseline will be 100 mg relacorilant once daily for 2 weeks.  
• From Visit OL2 through Visit OL10, the dose of relacorilant will be increased every 
4 weeks by 100 mg, as tolerated and based on improvement in signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome, to a target dose of 400 mg once daily (i.e., to 200 mg at Visit OL2, to 300 mg at Visit OL6, and to 400 mg at Visit OL10). Clinical benefit in the Open -Label 
Phase will be assessed by [CONTACT_617935] a change from Baseline or change from the previous visit considering the following factors:
  
– BP measurements and anti -hypertensive medications

• If any planned dose escalation is postponed, Visit OL14 can be used for a final dose escalation.  
• Faster dose escalation during the open-label phase of the study for patients whose 
Cushing syndrome deteriorates may be allowed with medical monitor approval. 
• If access of patients to the study site is restricted due to the COVID -19 pandemic, dose 
escalation up to 200 mg may occur remotely if necessary. Subsequent dose escalations, 
however, are permitted only after completion of safety assessments.  
• Dose interruption, reduction and re- escalation are permitted for safety/tolerability.  
– The relacorilant dose can be reduced to a previous dose if it is not tolerated 
– Re-escalation after a dose reduction is permitted until Visit OL18.  
3.1.3 Randomized -Withdrawal Phase (Randomization to Visit RW12) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Response Criteria  
Patients who complete the OL phase and meet the following response criteria for DM/IGT or 
hypertension at Visit OL22 (see below and Section  3.6) will be randomized between Visit OL22 
and up to 2 weeks  after that visit in a 1:1 ratio to receive relacorilant or placebo for 12 weeks : 
• Patients with uncontrolled hypertension at Baseline must meet one of the following response criteria:  
– ≥5 mm Hg decrease in mean systolic BP (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (DBP) from Baseline to Visit OL22, without worsening of either, based on 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) 
Note : Increase of pre-existing blood pressure medication or initiation of new blood 
pressure medication, due to worsening in hypertension, disqualifies the patient from randomization into the RW phase. If a decrease in the BP medication occurred after the OL18  visit, reassess eligibility for randomization 4 weeks after the dose change.
 
• Patients with DM/IGT  at Baseline must meet one of the following response criteria:  
In patients with DM  
– HbA1c has decreased by ≥0.5% from Baseline to Visit OL22  
– The 2 -hour oGTT glucose is normalized (<140 mg/dL) or decreased by ≥50 mg/dL 
from Baseline to Visit OL22  
– Total daily insulin dose has decreased by ≥25% and HbA1c is unchanged or decreased compared with Baseline

Confidential  Page 40 of 116 In patients with IGT  
– The 2 -hour oGTT glucose is normalized (<140 mg/dL) from Baseline to Visit OL22 
Note:  Increase of pre -existing diabetes medication or initiation of new diabetes 
medication, due to worsening of hyperglycemia, disqualifies the patient from 
randomization into the RW phase. If a decrease in the insulin dose happened after Visit OL18, reassess eligibility for randomization 4 weeks after the dose change. 
• Patients with both DM/IGT and uncontrolled hypertension at Baseline who do not 
meet the above -mentioned response criteria for both conditions must meet one of the 
following: 
– Meets one of the DM or IGT response criteria with no worsening in hypertension 
– Meets one of the uncontrolled hypertension response criteria with no worsening in 
DM or IGT  
– Worsening in hypertension is defined as ≥5 mm Hg increase in either systolic BP and/or diastolic BP from Baseline to Visit OL22.  
– Worsening in DM is defined as a ≥0.5% increase in HbA1c from Baseline to Visit OL22. 
– Worsening in IGT is defined as a ≥50 mg/dL increase in the 2-hour oGTT from Baseline to Visit OL22.  
– Patients who meet either the DM/IGT criteria or the uncontrolled hypertension criteria will be randomized in the respective strata.  
Note:  Increase of pre -existing diabetes or blood pressure medication or initiation of new 
diabetes or blood pressure medication due to worsening hyperglycemia or hypertension, 
disqualifies the patient from randomization into the RW phase. If a decrease in insulin 
dose or BP medication occurred after Visit OL18, reassess eligibility for randomization 
4 weeks after the dose change.  
Randomization will be stratified to ensure balance in treatment assignment for patients that meet response criteria with in the DM/IGT and hypertension subgroups ( Section  9.1). 
Treatment assignment and selected study assessments in the RW phase will remain blinded to the Investigators, the Sponsor, and the patients until after database lock . 
No c hanges in the dose of study drug are allowed during the RW phase. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescue Criteria  during Randomized Withdrawal Phase  
2-hour oGTT and ABPM results during the RW Phase will be reviewed by [CONTACT_617936] . The unblinded Medical Monitor is unblinded to results of 
study assessments but is blinded to the treatment assignment. 
• If a patient in the DM/IGT subgroup meet s the first two  of the following criteria, or if a 
patient in the hypertension subgroup meets the third criterion, the results will be 
communicated to the study site , and rescue medication may be initiated or increased as 
per Section  5.4.2.  
– Fasting glucose increases by 50 mg/dL from visit OL22, AND

– Increases in mean SBP or mean DBP by [CONTACT_617921] 10 mm Hg from 
Visit OL22  
Unblinding of the 2-hour oGTT or ABPM results will not result in the unblinding of 
study treatment.  
In the event of rescue medication use before Visit RW12: 
• In patients randomized to the DM/IGT subgroup, oGTT assessments will continue as 
planned until Visit RW12. 
• In patients randomized to the hypertension subgroup, ABPM assessments will continue as planned until Visit RW12.

• Patients who complete Visit OL22, but do not meet a response criterion for 
randomization, will be instructed to discontinue study drug. The Follow- Up visit will be 
conducted [ADDRESS_820681] study visit.  
• If a patient discontinues early from the OL phase, the patient will complete an Early 
Termination visit at the time of last dose of study drug (or soon thereafter). The Follow-Up visit will be conducted [ADDRESS_820682] study visit.  
• If a patient discontinues early from the RW phase, the patient will be instructed to return for Visit RW12 per the patient’s original dosing schedule as well as for the Follow- Up

criterion for randomization, will be permitted to continue relacorilant treatment in an 
extension study if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], they have benefitted from the study drug and are expected to maintain that benefit as noted above. The same adherence rule applies.  
• Patients who continue on to the extension study within [ADDRESS_820685] study visit for these patients will be either the Visit OL22 (if criterion for randomization is not met) or Visit RW12 (if the RW phase was completed).  
3.3 Number of Patient s and Study Participation 
3.3.1 Number of Patient s 
Approximately 162 patients are planned to enroll into a 6-month OL phase of the study to ensure 
the randomization of approximately 46 patients with hypertension into the subsequent 3-month, placebo -controlled RW phase.  
Study enrollment will be monitored to ensure attainment of randomization targets. The  number 
of patients enrolled in the OL phase may be adjusted to ensure a sufficient  number of patients 
meeting response criteria to uncontrolled hypertension are randomized in the RW phase. Enrollment of patients may continue based on enrollment target projections. 
The sample size calculation is described in Section  9.4. 
3.3.2 Patient  Study Participation 
The maximum expected duration of a patient’s participation is 46 weeks, including up to 6 weeks 
for Screening , 22–[ADDRESS_820686] dose of study drug. Based on the availability of all data, after the 
OL22 visit, there could be up to 2 weeks until a patient is randomized.

Screen failures are defined as patient s who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not 
subsequently entered in the study.  
Patients who fail Screening  due to a laboratory result may be retested within the Screening  
period without prior Corcept approval. Other laboratory tests, not directly impacting patient 
eligibility, during the Screening  period may be repeated at the Investigator’s discretion. The 
24-hour ABPM may be repeated if there is a technical problem with the test.  
Whenever patients are rescreened, they must sign an informed consent form ( ICF) each time . 
The Screening  assessments that do not need to be repeated during rescreening are the 2-hour 
oGTT glucose (if performed within 2 weeks  of the Baseline Visit) and the dexamethasone 
suppression test (if performed within 12 weeks of consent ). 
4.4 Early  Patient Discontinuation or Withdrawal  
Patients may withdraw their consent to participate in the study at any time for any  reason without 
prejudice. The Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to document the specific reason 
why consent is withdrawn. 
The I nvestigator also has the right to withdraw patients from the study for the following reasons: 
The Investigator decides it is in the patient’s best interest to discontinue study drug and/or 
participation in the study. Reasons may include, but are not limited to, the patient requiring or starting a prohibited medication(s), or not adher ing to protocol procedures. 
• The patient experiences an AE or any of the special safety events outlined in Table 2, 
Section  5.3.1 that the I nvestigator believes requires withdrawal from the study. 
• Patient becomes pregnant.  
• Patient is lost to follow -up. Before a patient is determined to be lost to follow-up, 
reasonable efforts will be made to contact [CONTACT_46657]. 
• Patients whose Cushing syndrome deteriorates during the open-label phase of the study on the maximum tolerated dose of relacorilant. 
• Patients whose Cushing syndrome deteriorates significantly during the RW phase and cannot be controlled with symptomatic management of the comorbidities until the RW12  visit.  
Patients who discontinue study drug early should be encouraged to complete the 
end-of-treatment and follow -up assessments and to report any AEs, including SAEs, for [ADDRESS_820698] be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
For patients who withdraw consent to participate in the study, every effort should be made to 
determine whether the withdrawal of consent was related to an AE or a specific aspect of the 
study. If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to further participation in the study entirely—including follow-up, this should be clearly documented (1) in the patient’s medical record and signed by [CONTACT_11219] (2) in the eCRF.

Confidential  Page 55 of 116 5.2 Dose -Escalation Process 
• The starting dose at Baseline will be 100 mg relacorilant once daily for 2 weeks.  
During dose escalation, all patients will be escalated in a stepwise manner from 100 mg to 
400 mg once daily, based on tolerability and improvement in hypertension and/or 
hyperglycemia . The starting dose at Baseline will be 100 mg relacorilant once daily for 2 weeks, 
after which the dose will be increased to 200 mg. Then the dose will increase in 100 mg 
increments every 4 weeks. Dose escalation will be performed based on tolerability considering the following factors (only in patients whose current dose is well tolerated).  
In patients with hypertension only, the mean 24-hour BP (based on ABPM): 
• SBP is ≥130 mm Hg or  
• SBP is <130 mm Hg and has not decreased by ≥5 mm Hg from Baseline.  
• DBP is ≥80 mm Hg or  
• DBP is <80 mm Hg and has not decreased by ≥5 mm Hg from Baseline.  
In patients with DM/IGT only, the 2-hour glucose based on oGTT: 
Note: For visit OL2, the fasting glucose assessment from the C hemistry lab oratory  panel will 
be used for dose escalation purposes. 
• is ≥140 mg/dL or fasting glucose is >100 mg/dL or  
• is <140 mg/dL and has not decreased by ≥30 mg/dL from Baseline.  
In patients with both DM/IGT and hypertension: 
The mean 24 -hour BP (based on ABPM): 
• SBP is ≥130 mm Hg or  
• SBP is <130 mm Hg and has not decreased by ≥5 mm Hg from Baseline.  
• DBP is ≥80 mm Hg or  
• DBP is <80 mm Hg and has not decreased by ≥5 mm Hg from Baseline.  
AND  
• is ≥140 mg/dL or fasting glucose is >100 mg/dL or  
• is <140 mg/dL and has not decreased by ≥30 mg/dL from Baseline.  
• Dose escalation may be held if the patient cannot safely tolerate escalation to the next 
dose.  
• Faster dose escalation for patients whose Cushing syndrome deteriorates during the study may be allowed on a case-by-case basis after discussion and approval by [CONTACT_7195]. 
• If any planned dose escalation is postponed, Visit OL14 can be used for a final dose escalation.  
• If access of patients to the study site is restricted due to the COVID -19 pandemic, dose 
escalation up to 200 mg may occur remotely if necessary. Subsequent dose escalations, however, are permitted only after completion of safety assessments.  
• Dose escalations start the day after the Visit at which they are approved by [CONTACT_737]. 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | 17 May  2024 
Confidential  Page 56 of 116 • After normalization of hypertension and/or hyperglycemia, further dose escalation will be 
allowed considering the following factors: 
• Body weight and waist circumference  
• Cushingoid appearance and striae 
• Sit-to-stand test  
• Beck Depression inventory 
• Cushing Quality-of- Life questionnaire  
• If all symptoms of Cushing syndrome present at Baseline have resolved, no dose escalation will occur beyond that visit  
5.3 Dose  Modifications 
Every effort should be made to administer study drug on the planned dose and schedule.  
Dose interruption, or reduction and re- escalation , are permitted for safety/tolerability , as follows: 
• Dose interruptions or reductions may occur at any time, including between visits, during 
the OL phase.  
• No changes in the dose of study drug are allowed during the RW phase. 
• Re-escalation after a dose reduction is permitted, with the approval of the Medical 
Monitor, until Visit OL18 (so that the OL period ends on a stable dose). 
• During study-drug interruptions, patients will continue on the same visit schedule.  
Dose reductions to manage excessive GR antagonism are outlined in Section  5.3.1. 
5.3.1 Dose Interruption and/or Discontinuation: Special Safety Events 
Based on the mechanism of action of relacorilant, there is a theoretical risk of excessive GR 
antagonism, which could manifest with findings such as weakness, tiredness, dizziness, 
hypoglycemia, dehydration, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or muscle aches. Because relacorilant does not a ffect the mineralocorticoid receptor, it is unlikely that hypotension would 
occur in the absence of antihypertensive medication. 
The actions outlined in Table 2 should be taken if a patient: 
• Exhibits signs and symptoms of excessive GR antagonism. 
• Experiences significant trauma, surgery, or medical illness occurring at any time during 
the study (through [ADDRESS_820706] dose). 
At study enrollment, all patients will be given a card to carry with them that identifies their 
potential risk for excessive GR antagonism. The card will contain the following information: 
• Mention use of relacorilant (“glucocorticoid receptor antagonist”). 
• Potential need for glucocorticoid use in setting of shock, surgery, serious illness, or 
injury. 
• Recommended dose of replacement steroids (4 to 10 mg dexamethasone intramuscularly or intravenously). 
• Investigator contact [CONTACT_3031].

 Criteria for Interrupting and Restarting or Modifying Study Drug  and Patient Management  Criteria for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_617906] : Signs and symptoms of excessive GR antagonism  
Management:  
• Immediately interrupt relacorilant treatment for at least [ADDRESS_820707] supportive care, 
including fluid resuscitation, as indicated.  
• If appropriate, administer supplemental glucocorticoids given in high doses to overcome the GR antagonism produced by [CONTACT_44114]. Initially, consider parenteral dexamethasone (4  to 10 mg), 
followed by [CONTACT_617941] 1 to 3 days and tapered thereafter, depending on clinical response. In some cases, higher doses of dexamethasone for longer periods of time may be required.  
• If the patient has been receiving treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, consider discontinuing it or adjusting the dose, particularly in the presence of hypotension.  
• Restart relacorilant treatment only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks and after a discussion with the Medical Monitor.  
­ Restart relacorilant at the lowest tolerable dose previously administered to the patient.

characteristics, such as years since diagnosis and Cushing syndrome type (e.g., ectopic ACTH 
secretion, primary pi[INVESTIGATOR_44085], primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia), will be documented at Screening .  
6.2.3 Medical and Medication History  
Patient medical history, including the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment history of Cushing syndrome (including dexamethasone suppression test failure where appropriate), diagnosis of DM/IGT  and/or hypertension, as well as other illnesses and allergies, date(s) of onset, and 
whether conditions are currently ongoing will be recorded at Screening  and Baseline 
(Appendix A ). Surgery and radiation history will include date and type.  
A menstrual history will be obtained for all female patients at Screening . 
At Screening , a list of current medications will be obtained, including start date, dosage, and 
route of administration, along with any medications taken in the 3 months before start of study to treat Cushing syndrome, diabetes, and/or hypertension. 
6.[ADDRESS_820721] results (hematology and chemistry), thyroid function tests, lipid profile, AE s, and concomitant medications, will be assessed at the time points specified 
Appendix A . In patients with pi[INVESTIGATOR_617908], a pi[INVESTIGATOR_617909] (MRI) scan will be performed to evaluate tumor size . During the RW phase, clinical 
laboratory test results (hematology and chemistry), thyroid functions tests, and lipid profiles will remain  blinded.  
In the event study visits are shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, safety assessments should be prioritized. 
6.3.1 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination, including evaluation of general appearance, head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat, as well as dermatologic, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, extremities/musculoskeletal, and neurologic body systems, will be performed ( Appendix A ).

Confidential  Page 67 of 116 Any clinically significant abnormalities observed during Screening  should be reported in the 
patient’s medical history; if observed any time after the first dose of study drug (Day 1) up to 
[ADDRESS_820722] dose of study drug, they will be considered treatment- emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs).  
Height will only be measured at Screening  (Appendix A ).  
6.3.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including BP, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral body temperature, will be obtained at the time points specified in Appendix A . Blood pressure will be measured in both arms at 
Screening and the arm with the higher diastolic reading  will be recorded  and used for all 
subsequent measurements. Blood pressure and heart rate will be taken after the patient has rested in a sitting position for approximately 15 minutes  and ≥ 30 minutes after smoking or caffeine 
intake. Automated BP machines can be used to standardize measurements. 
Unscheduled assessments of vital signs can be performed as necessary.  
In addition to the safety vital signs collected, a 24-hour ABPM will also be done by [CONTACT_617944] ( Section  6.4.2) during treatment at the time points 
specified in Appendix A . 
6.3.3 Electrocardiogram  
Twelve- lead ECG tracings will be obtained in triplicate at Screening  and in duplicate at other 
time points  (2 hours ±30 minutes after study- drug dosing) as designated in Section  [ADDRESS_820723] 10 minutes before each ECG evaluation. 
Electrocardiogram data will be submitted to a central reviewer; instructions will be provided in the study manual. A Sponsor-approved alternative option for ECGs (i.e., use of alternative 
locations for assessment)  is permitted in the event of site closures due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
The Investigator or designee will indicate in the source documents whether the ECG was normal; 
abnormal, but not clinically significant; or abnormal and clinically significant. Any new or worsened abnormality noted as clinically significant will be reported as an AE. 
In patients with an abnormal QTc interval at Screening  in which no concomitant drugs known 
to prolong QTc and no electrolyte abnormalities are present, triplicate ECG recordings should be 
obtained. The final decision on excluding a patient should be based on the average QTcF interval 
across the recordings. If an electrolyte abnormality is present, it should be corrected before the 
ECG is repeated. If the patient is taking a concomitant medication k nown to cause QT 
prolongation, an alternative medication may be considered, and the ECG repeated after an appropriate washout  period.

[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Parameters 
Fasting blood samples will be collected for the analysis of safety at the time points specified in 
Appendix A . Laboratory samples will be analyzed at 1 or more central laboratories; instructions 
will be provided in the laboratory manual.  
Laboratory values for an analyte that are outside of the normal range for that analyte per the 
applicable central laboratory will be identified and can be repeated at the Investigator’s 
discretion. The Investigator will determine whether any out-of-range laboratory values that emerge during the study are clinically significant. Any clinically significant laboratory value will 
be reported as an AE. Patients with a clinically significant out-of-range laboratory value will be 
followed until the laboratory value returns to normal or becomes medically stable. The Investigator will treat the patient, as medically required, at appropriate intervals until this occurs.  
During the RW phase, the results for all laboratory assessments will remain blinded. The unblinded Medical Monitor will review laboratory values and will notify the Investigator and study- site staff of any critical out-of-range laboratory values. To maintain the blind investigators 
should not repeat laboratory tests locally unless medically necessary. 
The Investigator will review all laboratory reports, evaluate the results, and sign/date the reports.  
Laboratory parameters, inclusive of efficacy, safety, PK , and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters 
to be assessed are listed in Table 3.

6.4.9 Global Clinical Response  
The DRB (see Section  5.10.1) will evaluate all patients for  Global Clinical Response at the time 
points specified in Appendix A . The Global Clinical Response assessment (adapted from 
Katznelson et al. 2014 ) comprises items from 7 clinical categories: 
1. Glucose: fasting blood glucose, 2-hour oGTT ( Section  6.4.1), HbA 1c (Section  6.4.3), 
change in diabetes medications  
2. Blood pressure: systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( Section  6.4.2), change in 
antihypertensive medications 
3. Body composition: DXA Scan ( Section  6.4.4), body weight and waist circumference 
(Section  6.4.6) 
4. Clinical appearance (according to review of patient photographs): Cushingoid appearance 
and striae ( Section  6.4.10) 
5. Strength: sit- to-stand test ( Section  6.4.11) 
6. Psychiatric health/cognitive function: Beck Depression Inventory®- II (BDI -II) 
(Section  6.4.8), change in antidepressant medications , trail-making test 
7. Quality of life: Cushing QoL score ( Section  6.4.5 ) 
Each of 3 member s of the DRB  will review the 7 categories of clinical parameters above to 
evaluate whether  a patient’s signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome have changed, and will 
rate the patient ’s overall response based on the totality of signs and symptoms as  +1 (improved), 
0 (unchanged), or −1 (worsened) at every visit after Baseline. Each patient ’s final score will be 
the median of the [ADDRESS_820731] to the pre-randomization visit (Visit OL22) .

getting up again with/without the use of their arms or other aids. Patients seated in a chair will be asked to fold their arms across their chests and to stand up from the seated position once; if they are able to successfully rise from the chair, they will be asked to sit down again and then stand 
up and sit down [ADDRESS_820733] height so that the 
patient’s leg s are in flexion of approximately [ADDRESS_820734] (i.e., asked to place their feet under the front of the chair, not too far 
forward [in front of the chair] or too far back [under the chair seat]). The study staff will use a stopwatch to measure the total time it takes for the patient to stand up and sit down 5  times; start 
time is in the seated position and stop time is in the final standing position. The total time of the test is measured. Patients with gait or balance disorders are not required to complete the sit-to-stand test. The same or similar chair should be used for all measurements.

A Summary of Events (S OE) is provided in Appendix A . Most assessments are for all patients; 
a few are performed only in patients in a specific subgroup (i.e., the impaired glucose 
tolerance/diabetes subgroup or the uncontrolled hypertension subgroup). 
In the event that a patient is unable to come to the clinic to participate in study -related visits or  
procedures, Sponsor-approved alternative options may be provided to the Investigator sites based 
on the needs and safety of patients. This may include the provision of study-drug dispensation and delivery outside of the clinic. 
Any deviation from protocol procedures will be noted in the patient’s clinical chart and eCRF. 
In addition, the Sponsor will be promptly notified of any protocol deviations. Though alternative 
methods for safety and study assessments (i.e., phone contact, virtual study visits, use of 
alternative locations for assessment, including local labs or imaging centers, etc.) are permitted 
due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_820741] complete the 
Screening /Baseline 24-hour UFC tests, salivary cortisol tests, oGTTs, HbA1c, and 24-hour 
ABPM  as described in S ection  6.2.1.  
The window for each study visit is relative to the Baseline or the Randomization Visit. The acceptable visit window is ±3  days for Visits  OL2, OL 6, and OL10 and ±7 days for all other 
visits  (except when RW12 serves as the return visit following early discontinuation from the RW 
phase, in which case a 3 -week visit window [2 weeks before the scheduled visit, 1 week after the 
scheduled visit] for RW12  is permitted ). The Randomization visit (the first day of the RW phase) 
may occur up to [ADDRESS_820742] to sequence of tests and acceptable time windows: 
• Predose procedures must be completed before dosing and, where applicable, before 
breakfast.  
• Dosing will take place at the scheduled time after completion of all predose procedures.  
• At all visits beginning with OL2, study drug should be taken in the clinic during the visit 
and after initial blood draws.  
• Pharmacokinetic sampling will take precedence over other procedures when more than 
1 procedure is scheduled for the same time point relative to dosing. Acceptable time windows for PK samples at Visit OL18 are:  
Within 1  hour before dosing for the predose sample. 
±10 minutes for the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-hour postdose samples. 
• All clinical laboratory samples and predose PK samples will be collected when the patient is fasting (at least 4  hours). 
• Ambulatory BP monitoring will be initiated in the clinic after all blood samples are obtained. 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | 17 May  2024 
Confidential  Page 77 of 116 • Study-drug dosing should occur after the completion of the 2-hour oGTT test (except for 
OL18, when oGTT may take place after dosing for logistical issues due to serial PK sampling that would prolong patient stay).  
• Acceptable time windows for oGTT samples are:  
±10 minutes for the 0.5- , 1-, 1.5-, and 2- hour samples.  
• Measurement of vital signs and ECG recordings will be avoided within 15 minutes after venipuncture or cannulation and, therefore, will normally be performed before blood sampling. Electrocardiogram recording should be performed 2 hours ±30 minutes after study-drug dosing. 
The Investigator may repeat tests in the event of a technical failure and/or if additional 
observations or samples of blood are needed to monitor patient safety; these will not be considered protocol deviations. 
The required procedures for each study visit are outlined in the study Schedule of Visits and

Confidential  Page 87 of 116 8 SAFETY EVENT DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING  
8.1 Investigator’s Responsibilities  
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this study 
and for providing appropriate medical care. Investigators are required to report promptly to 
Corcept Therapeutics or its designee any AE that may reasonably be regarded as caused by, or probably caused by, the study drug. If the adverse effect is alarming, the Investigator should 
report the adverse effect immediately. In addition, the Investigators are responsible for alerting 
Corcept Therapeutics or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if the event may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the patient, and for reporting the event on the appropriate eCRF or safety report form.  
By [CONTACT_16779], the Investigator remains responsible for managing AEs that are serious or that cause a patient to withdraw before completing the study. Frequency 
of follow-up of any particular AE is left to the discretion of the Investigator. Duration of 
follow-up and requirements for immediate  SAE reporting (within 24 hours of the event) are 
described below.  
8.2 Monitoring Safety Data During Study  
Safety results collected during the study (e.g., AEs, laboratory test results, physical findings) will be monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_617954]. In addition, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established to conduct periodic 
reviews of data to ensure the safety of patients  (Section  5.10.2). During the RW phase, 2-hour 
oGTT and ABPM results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_617955] . 
8.[ADDRESS_820746] a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product that emerges or worsens relative to the patient’s pretreatment b aseline, whether or not it is considered to be 
related to the investigational product.  
Illnesses present before the patient signs the ICF are considered pre-existing conditions and are 
documented on the medical history eCRF. Pre-existing conditions that worsen during the study are entered on the AE eCRF.  
8.4 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death (i.e., the AE caused or led to the fatality). 
• Is life -threatening (i.e., the AE refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).  
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | 17 May  2024 
Confidential  Page 88 of 116 • Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46621]/surgical procedures are not SAEs by [CONTACT_44134]).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial reduction of the patient’s ability to perform activities of daily living).  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect (i.e., an adverse finding in a child or fetus 
of a patient exposed to the study medication before conception or during pregnancy).  
• Involves other medically important conditions (i.e., the AE does not meet any of the 
above serious criteria but based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the serious outc omes 
listed in these criteria).  
8.5 Clinical Significance  
The Investigator (or medically qualified designee) is responsible for determining whether an AE 
is clinically significant for the patient. Clinical significance will be documented in the patient’s medical records with the AE information.  
8.[ADDRESS_820747] dose of study drug will be considered posttreatment AEs and do not 
need to be reported to Corcept, unless the event meets the definition of serious (see Section  8.4) 
and the relationship to the study drug is possibly or probably related (see Section  8.8.2). In such 
cases, these posttreatment SAEs need to be reported per the process in Section  8.9. 
All AEs for enrolled patients will be documented on the AE eCRF and in the patient’s medical 
record. The following attributes must be assigned: (1) description, (2) dates of onset and 
resolution, (3) severity ( Section  8.8.1), (4) relationship to the study drug ( Section  8.8.2), 
(5) “serious” criteria, if applicable ( Section  8.4), and (6) action taken. The Investigator will 
actively solicit this information and assess th e AEs in terms of severity and relationship to study 
drug. The Investigator will treat the patient as medically required until the AE either resolves or 
becomes medically stable. This treatment may extend beyond the duration of the study. The 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | [ADDRESS_820748] treatment and medications required for treatment on the appropriate 
eCRF(s).  
In the event that a patient is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, the event must be recorded on the Termination eCRF as the reason for discontinuation. 
All AEs that are possibly or probably related to the study drug and unexpected (not reported in 
the Investigator’s Brochure or greater severity or frequency than that described in the Investigator’s Brochure) must be reported to the governing IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Health Autho rities, as required.  
8.8 Adverse-Event Classification 
8.8.1 Intensity  Grades of Adverse Events  
The seriousness of an AE should not be confused with its severity. To describe the maximum severity of the AE on the AE eCRF, the Investigator will use the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0 ( NCI-CTCAE 
2017). For events not listed in the CTCAE, the definitions from the CTCAE provided in Table 6 
should be used to evaluate the grade of severity of the AE.  
Table 6 Adverse Event  Grades Based on the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events  
Grade  Description  
1 Mild : Asymptomatic  or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
2 Moderate : Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living ( e.g., preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_19640], using the telephone, and managing money)  
3 Severe : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self- care 
activities of daily living ( e.g., bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden) 
4 Life-threatening : Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
5 Death : Death related to AE

8.8.2 Relationship  of Adverse Event to Study Drug or Procedure  
The Investigator responsible for the patient’s care (or qualified designee) will assess causality o f 
AEs and SAEs based on the causal attribution guidance in Table 7. The Investigator’s 
assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and nonserious).

Possibly related to study drug  An AE  that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. An alternative 
explanation is inconclusive, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concurrent disease(s).  
Probably related to study drug  An AE  that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is

outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) should be followed and documented even if the patient has discontinued the study. 
8.11.2 Paternal Exposure 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) should if possible be followed and documented. To capture information 
about a pregnancy from the partner of a male patient, the Investigator or designee must first obtain the consent of the male patient’s partner; the male patient should not be asked to provide 
this information. A consent form specific to this situation must be used. The outcome of any 
conception occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_820753]

the primary endpoint in the RW Phase. 
The per -protocol analysis population (PP -RW) will include all patients in the mITT -RW 
population who  complete d the study according to protocol specifications without a major 
deviation. Protocol deviations result ing in exclusion from the PP population will be identified in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP) . The determination of the PP analysis population will be 
finalized prior to database lock. Patients in the PP population who complete the RW phase 
without a major deviation will be used in sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and the 
secondary endpoints in the RW phase.  The mITT -RW and PP -RW populations will be used for 
supportive efficacy analyses of all endpoints in the RW Phase. 
The ITT-OL population will include all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of study 
drug. The mITT- OL population will include all patients in the ITT -OL population with at least 
one post-baseline efficacy assessment for efficacy endpoints. The per -protocol analysis (PP- OL)

Analyses of glycemic control response measures will be performed on all patients in the ITT population with DM/IGT regardless of whether they have hypertension at Baseline. 
Analyses of hypertension response measures will be performed on all patients in the ITT population with hypertension, regardless of whether they have DM/IGT at Baseline.  
The S afety P opulation will consist of all enrolled patients who received at least 1  dose of study 
drug. It will be used for all safety analyses. 
9.2 General Statistical Considerations  
The statistical analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_1052]/or its designee. Statistical methods 
will be prespecified and documented in detail in a statistical analysis plan , to be finalized before 
database lock.  
All continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of patients, means, percentiles, standard deviations) and confidence intervals  (CIs) for values measured at 
each visit, as well as changes from Baseline. F or categorical variables , counts, percentages , and 
their 95%  CIs will be presented  for each visit. 
Predose measurements on Day 1 will be considered the B aseline values for the OL phase

may be adjusted to ensure a sufficient number of patients meeting response criteria to 
uncontrolled hypertension are randomized in the RW phase. Enrollment of patients may continue based on enrollment target projections. 
Forty -six patients with hypertension (23 per treatment  group) will ensure at least 90% power to 
detect the difference between placebo and treatment arms in loss of response, assuming a loss of 
response in 25% of patients in the treatment arm and 75% in the placebo arm. These calculations 
are based on a Fisher’ s exact test of proportions at the alpha=0.[ADDRESS_820757] the target differences in the primary endpoint for the

The numbers of patients who were screened  and who participated in the OL and RW phases 
along with the reasons for withdrawal in each phase will be summarized.

used at Baseline and each study visit will be generated .  
9.5.4 Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
For the hypertension subgroup of the ITT-RW population, the primary analysis will be a responder analysis and the odds ratio for loss of response in hypertension control will be 
reported , as well as the percentage of patients with loss of response and 95% CI (using Clopper -
Pearson method). The loss of response with respect to hypertension will be compared between 
treatment and placebo arms at Visit RW12 using a logistic regression model with 2 independent 
variables (treatment arm and stratification factor). In the hypertension subgroup, this 
stratification factor identifies patients with or without DM/ IGT.  
In the hypertension subgroup, loss of response in the RW phase is defined as: use of rescue 
medication for hypertension after randomization but before Visit RW12 , discontinuation of 
treatment  before Visit RW12 , or increase in SBP/DBP of >[ADDRESS_820759] to hypertension at Visit RW12 in the hypertension subgroup of the ITT- RW 
population. 
A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint by [CONTACT_617959]. Details  will be described in 
the S AP. Additional sensitivity analyses may be pre-specified in the SAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Approach to  Missing Data Analysis 
All efforts will be made to prevent missing data . In the hypertension subgroup of the ITT- RW 
population, patients that discontinue treatment prior to Visit RW12, use rescue medication prior 
to Visit RW12 , or for whom SBP/DBP measurements were not collected at Visit RW12, and 
therefore have missing data at Visit RW12 will be considered as non-responders in the primary 
analysis for loss of response in hypertension control. 
Imputation of missing data at Visit RW12 for the  secondary continuous endpoints (i.e., SBP, 
DBP) related to assessment of hypertension control will be performed based on data from 
retrieved dropouts, with similar baseline characteristics, within the same treatment arm. For 
patients who use rescue medication for hypertension before Visit RW12, a placebo- based mean 
imputation method will be used to impute the Visit RW12 value.  If fewer than 10 retrieved 
Protocol CORT125134- 455
Corcept Therapeutics  Amendment 7 | 17 May  2024 
Confidential  Page 95 of 116 dropouts are available, then the main analysis will use a wash-out multiple imputation method 
instead of the retrieved dropout approach. 
In patients in the DM/IGT subgroup, imputation of missing data at Visit RW12 for the secondary 
endpoint of change in AUC glucose  from Visit OL22  to Visit RW12 will be performed depending 
on whether or not patient takes rescue medication. For patients who do not use rescue medication for DM/IGT before Visit RW12 (regardless if they discontinue treatment), all values for AUC
glucose  up to the Visit RW12, will be used in the analysis (including values from retrieved 
dropouts ). Patients who do not take rescue medication for whom AUC glucose  at Visit RW12 is 
missing will have data imputed based on data from retrieved dropouts, with similar baseline characteristics, within the same treatment arm. For patients who use rescue medication for 
DM/IGT before Visit RW12,  the values measured after the use of rescue medication are 
considered irrelevant to the clinical question of interest. In this case, a placebo- based mean 
imputation method will be used.  
The guidance on The Prevention and Treatment of Missing Data in Clinical Trials  (National 
Research Council 2010) will be followed when these methods are applied.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Multiplicity Adjustment for  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
No adjustment for multiplicity will be made for secondary and exploratory endpoints. [IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints in the RW Phase  
For continuous endpoints in the RW phase of the study, the analysis will be performed using a 
linear MMRM model. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation will be used. The MMRM model will include Visit OL22 value (for the respective endpoint) as a c ovariate; 
treatment, visit, treatment by [CONTACT_23259], and stratification factor as fixed effects; and patients within treatment groups as random effects. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model within-patient error, and the Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to model 
denominator degrees of freedom. This model is used after imputation of missing data at Visit 
RW12 , using the retr ieved drop-out approach. If fewer than 10 retrieved dropouts are available 
for the endpoint , then the main analysis will use a wash -out multiple imputation method instead 
of the retrieved dropout approach. 
The analysis for each of the endpoints will determine whether  there is a difference between 
treatment groups in terms of change from Randomization to Visit RW12. This will be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_617960]. Additional details will be described in the SAP. 
For all endpoints described as proportions in the RW phase, the point estimate and the 2-sided 
95% CI will be calculated.  
Sensitivity analyses will be pre- specified in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
The Exploratory Endpoints listed in Section  3.6.3 will be analyzed using methods similar to the 
analyses of secondary endpoints described in S ection  [IP_ADDRESS] and will be detailed further in the

11.1 Quality Management 
As part of quality management based on a risk-based approach per ICH E6(R2): risk reduction 
activities may be incorporated in protocol design and implementation, monitoring plans, 
agreements between parties defining roles and responsibilities, systematic safeguards to ensure adherence to standard operating procedures, and training in processes and procedures.  
Predefined quality tolerance limits should be established, taking into consideration the medical and statistical characteristics of the variables as well as the statistical design of the trial, to identify systematic issues that can impact subject safety or reliability of trial results. Detection of 
deviations from the predefined quality tolerance limits should trigger an evaluation to determine 
if action is needed.  
Study sites, the study database, and study documentation will be monitored regularly and may be 
subject to a quality assurance audit during the study by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and/or the Sponsor or its 
designee. In addition, inspections may be conducted by [CONTACT_617970].  
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and 
data QC checks will be run on the database. Any missing data or data anomalies will be 
communicated to the study site(s) for clarification/resolution.  
Following written SOPs, the study- specific monitoring plan, the monitors will verify that the 
clinical study is conducted, data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in 
compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices, Good Manufacturing Practices).  
Upon request, the investigational site will provide direct access and allow the Sponsor (or its representative including monitors and/or auditors), IRB/IEC and regulatory authorities to review and inspect all trial-related sites, drug storage area, study-drug stock, drug accountability records, patient charts, source documents, and other records related to study conduct.

11.3 Documentation 
11.3.1 Source Documents  
Source documents provide all original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
information from a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial (e.g., a patient’s medical records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], clinic charts, th e Investigator’s patient study 
files, results of diagnostic tests, including x-rays, laboratory tests and ECGs). All source data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and completed. Changes to source data should be traceable (i.e., dated and initialed), should not obscure the original entry, and should be explained, if necessary.  
Investigators must retain all original source documents. The Sponsor or its designee will notify 
Investigators in writing when the trial-related records are no longer needed. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_820764]. All data entered into CRFs (paper or electronic) must be substantiated by [CONTACT_16793] a source document.  
Discrepancies between CRFs and their respective source documents should be explained. All

11.4 Long- Term Retention of Biological Samples  
All biological samples will be retained by [CONTACT_617971]/IEC approval. Samples will be held for a period up to 15 years 
after completion of the clinical study report. The Sponsor or its designee may store the patient’s sample(s) longer if required to address regulatory agency questions; in this event, the patient’s sample(s) will be destroyed after all questions are adequately answered.  
An individual patient can choose to withdraw consent to have their samples used for future research at any time without affecting their participation in the study or their care by [CONTACT_44151]. After receipt of a request for sample destruction, that patient’s sample(s) will then no 
longer be used for future research purposes beyond the current study, and their sample(s) will be destroyed. However, if there are ongoing regulatory questions, the patient’s sample(s) will be destroyed after all questions are adequately answered.  
The long- term retention samples will be coded to allow de -identification according to applicable 
regulatory guidelines. It is the responsibility of the trial site to ensure that samples are appropriately labeled in accordance with trial procedures to comply with all applicable laws.  
Biological samples collected from participants as part of this trial will be transported, stored, accessed, and processed in accordance with all applicable laws relating to the use and storage of human tissue for research purposes. 
Such activities shall at least meet the requirements as set out in the [ADDRESS_820768] and 
the 2006 Human Tissue (Scotland) Act. 
Samples may be subject, but not limited to European Directives 2002/58/EC, the General Data 
Protection Regulation 2016/679, and any legislation and/or regulation implementing or made pursuant to them, or which amends, replaces, re-enacts, or consolidates any of them, and all other

9.3 Hypothesis 
Testing  Revised analysis methods.  In order to ensure experiment -wise Type I error control, the secondary endpoints 
will be tested using a hierarchical testing approach at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05. 
If the null hypothesis is rejected for the primary endpoint, secondary endpoints 
will be sequentially tested following the gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_617918].  No adjustments for multiplicity will be made for secondary and  exploratory 
endpoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis 
of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  Revised analysis methods.  As a sensitivity analysis, patients for whom loss of response in hypertension 
control at Visit RW12 is missing because ABPM measurements are not available 
(non- retrieved dropouts), will have data imputed based on data from retrieved 
dropouts, with similar baseline characteristics, within the same treatment arm.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Approach to Missing Data Analysis  Clarified analysis methods.  If fewer than 10 retrieved dropouts are available, then the main analysis will use a wash -out multiple imputation method instead of the retrieved dropout 
approach.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Multiplicity Adjustment for Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  Clarified analysis methods.  Details regarding adjustment for multiplicity across primary and secondary 
endpoints will be provided in the SAP.  No adjustment for multiplicity will be 
made for secondary and exploratory endpoints.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis 
of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints in the RW Phase  Revised analysis methods based on no longer differentiating between key secondary and other secondary endpoints ; 
clarified analysis methods.  The loss of response (AUC -based) with respect to hyperglycemic control will be 
compared between treatment and placebo arms at Visit RW12 using a logistic 
regression model with 2 independent variables (treatment arm and stratification 
factor). In the DM/IGT  subgroup, this stratification factor identifies patients with 
or without hypertension.  
For all endpoints described as proportions in the RW phase, the point estimate and 
the 2 sided 95% CI will be calculated.  
-- 
This model is used after imputation of missing data at Visit RW12, using the 
retrieved drop -out approach. If fewer than 10 retrieved dropouts are 
available for the endpoint, then the main analysis will use a wash -out multiple 
imputation method instead of t he retrieved dropout approach.

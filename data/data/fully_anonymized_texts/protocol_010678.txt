 SPECIFIC AIMS  
In the [LOCATION_002], HIV/AIDS has disproportionately affected men who have sex with 
men (MSM).(1) In recent years, the highest rates of HIV have been concentrated among 
increasingly younger MSM, especially those o f color in the Southern US.(1-4) Jackson MS,  site of 
this study, has the highest prevalence  of HIV among urban  MSM in the US (39.5 per 100 MSM)  
and the third highest rate among Black MSM under the age of 25 . (3, 5)  Unfortunately, there is no 
evidenced -based prevention  progra m for adolescent MSM (ages 13 to 18), who are the 
youngest, most vulnerable group.(6) Of 84 CDC -classified evidence -based interventions, only 9  
were specifically designed for MSM, minorities were not adequately represented, and only 2 
included MSM less than 1 8 years of age.(6) A prevention program specifically designed for this 
vulnerable adolescent group  needs to be tested for efficacy and made available for widespread 
use, especially in the South. Provid ing early intervention to this population of adolescents may 
foster their early adoption of protective practices (e.g., safer sex, linka ge to care for HIV/STD 
testing  and treatment, PrEP use ).  
Parents may exert the most significant, longitudinal influence in the lives of adolescents 
and research with heterosexual youth indicates that family -based interventions can be 
efficacious. Parents of non -heterosexual youth have not general ly been included  in research  
because of the perceived difficulty of gain ing their consent or because of  adolescents’  fears of 
engaging parents.(7) Fortunately, parents of non-heterosexual youth  may be more accessible 
than commonly thought and they can be included safely. Elze , for example,  found that 48% of 
non-heterosexual adolescents were willing to have caregivers contact[CONTACT_197836].(8) In additio n, four other recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_197788]-heterosexual youth  may want help with their child’s sexuality, and that 
a short video (without in -person contact) can positively impac t parent attitudes.(9-12) Drs. Brown 
and Crosby [CONTACT_197837] a NIMH -funded HIV prevention study .(13-16) known as 
Project  STYLE . This randomized controlled trial successfully enrolled 721 racially and ethnically 
diverse heterosexual adolescent parent/caregiver dyads in three U.S. cities with a participation 
rate of 94%. This family based intervention was efficacious and evid ence from the RCT and a 
subsequent DVD version tested among Black adolescents shows  that parental invol vement is 
highly protective.(13) MySTYLE  has been designated as a “best evidence” intervention for risk 
reduction b y the CDC . This success , and similar research , supports the utility of i ncluding 
parents  in programs designed to promote sexual h ealth among adolescents .(17, 18) The proposed  
project will adapt key elements of STYLE and its DVD to create on online HIV intervention 
program (MySTYLE) that will be delivered to  non-heterosexual  Black adolescent males 
(nHBAM) , ages 13 to 18, and their parents/caregivers in Jackson, MS.  We recognize  the 
inherent risks to nHBAM  of disclosing their sexual desires/activities to parents/caregivers. 
Therefore, the intervention program will occur in a two -stage sequence. We plan that nHBAM  
will first be enrolled under waivers of parental consent, un less th ey are willing to have parents  
contact[CONTACT_197838].  A key aspect of the eight -week online 
intervention program for nHBAM is provision of motivation and skills needed to discuss sex and 
sexuality with parents/caregivers. Further more , MySTYLE will teach nHBAM  how to evaluate 
and enhance the safety of disclosing to parents/caregivers who initially may not be accepting 
about sam e sex desires/behaviors.  By [CONTACT_197839] -week program , nHBAM  who have 
not previously done so will be asked to consider inviting their parents/caregivers into the 
program . Online materials  for enrollment and intervention  will be provided to pare nts/caregivers.  
The project  will use formative work  to adapt  the family -based  Project  STYLE  to the needs  
of nHBAM  and their parents/caregivers. Working with a n advisory board, an iterative development  
process will  refine  and tailor  the online i ntervention . We reco gnize the inherent risks to 
adolescents  of disclosing their sexual desire/ activities to parents/caregivers . We will enroll  
those who indicate  interest in a program to support healthy adolescent relationships and 
acceptance of straight and gay adolescents. Adolescents will not need to reveal their sexual 
Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235153] , we conducted two focus groups in Jackson MS 
and recruited 17 youth , and their caregivers  from agencies, clinics an d school s; 94% (16/17)  of 
the teens self -identified as non -heterosexual. These same recruitment strategies will be used in 
this proposed project.  
The Year [ADDRESS_235154]  of: 1) interviews  of adolescents,  2) interviews  of 
parents/caregivers , and 3) interviews  of stakeholders  such  as staff from LGBT  organizations,  
schools,  churches,  and state  agencies.  Findings  from the interviews  will inform the Year 2 
iterative  development  and refinement  phase  between  the investigators,  the medi a company  
(MEE  Productions,  see Facilities ), and workgroups  (composed  of youth,  parents , stakeholders,  
investigators).  It will culminate  in the creation  of MySTYLE,  which is proposed to use an 
engaging  online novella  to increase  motivation  and skills  to support  healthy  sexual  behavior,  
communication,  and family  processes  (connectedness  and parent  practices) for nHBAM  and 
their parents/caregivers.  MySTYLE  will be tested  in a small Randomized Trial Phase in Year [ADDRESS_235155] control  will 
receive the MySTYLE intervention  after the active treatment group.   
 Aims: 1) To use interviews with youth, parents/caregivers, and other stakeholders to 
identify  the relevant elements needed for a family -based intervention for Black adolescent males 
who do not identify as heterosexual  and their parents/caregivers. 2) To use the ADAPT -ITT 
Model in an iterative approach b etween investigators, an advisory board , and a media company 
to refine  and tailor MySTYLE . 3) To conduct a preliminary efficacy test of MySTYLE to assess 
effect size diff erences in HIV -related knowledge, attitudes, sexual behavior, and in acceptance 
of HIV testing , as well as parental attitudes and behavior .  4) To examine the overall perceptions 
of youth as to how each module could be improved for greater appeal to other young males of a 
similar age and background and the attributions of youth regarding which modules (if any) had 
an impact on their sexual risk behaviors . This aim uses in -depth, post -test interviews of 
adolescents  and parents . These data will be used to inform adaptation of the intervention to be 
tested in a larger sample.   
 
SIGNIFICANCE  
Overview  and Premise : Because parents and other caregivers are a significant, longitudinal 
influence on their adolescents, we propose to adapt an efficacious family -based HIV prevention 
intervention (STYLE) for use by [CONTACT_197840]. 
For the purposes of this application, we will refer to this group as non -heterosexual Black 
adolescent males (nHBAM). While we fully recognize that nHBAM are a larger population than 
Black adolescent  men who have sex with men  (MSM ), our intent is to develo p an online 
intervention program that avoids any stigma from a program that assumes  participants  are 
sexually active with other males. Recent work, reviewed below, su ggests that parents of many 
nHBAM  are more open and available for inte rventions than  previously though t and that includin g 
parents/caregivers can be safe and beneficial . We will enroll adolescents and 
parents/caregivers who indicate interest in healthy adolescent relationships and acceptance of 
straight and gay adolescents. Adolescents wi ll not need to reveal their sexual behavior or 
attitudes, although we expect that the majority of youth who participate will be  non-
heterosexual, due to enrollment  community  and clinic  venues that serve  nHBAM  and with 
recruiters familiar with the LGBT community . The intervention adaptation will occur through 
detailed, comprehensive , formative work conducted  with nHBAM , their parents/caregivers, and 
community stakeholders  in Jackson, MS . The investigators have experience in developi[INVESTIGATOR_197789]. I n addition, a sophisticated media company (MEE productions, with whom they 
have previously worked) will help  adapt the STYLE DVD intervention, which uses novella and 
Version 10 1/6/202 1

 interactive elements to engage adolesce nts and parents , into an online intervention tailored for 
nHBAM (to be called MySTYLE). MySTYLE will be tested for feasibility and effect sizes in a 
small , randomized trial with 72 nHBAM and their parents/caregive rs in Jackson MS . 
 The H IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_197790] : Men who have sex with men (MSM) are dramatically 
more likely to be infected with HIV  than any other population in the U.S . Of all males diagnosed 
with HIV during 2009 -2013, 22% of those were ages 13 -24 years and 91% of the infections in 
those were attributed to male -to-male sexual contact .(1) African American MSM account for 58% 
of all new HIV infections among MSM  aged 13 -24 years, respectively.(1) Adolescent MSM 
(AMSM)  under the age o f 19, are increasingly at risk for HIV , with a 22% increase in incidence 
between 2008 and 2010(1) yet there are no evidenced -based interventions (EBIs) specifica lly 
designed for them . Jackson MS , the site of this proposed project,  has the highest prevalence 
rate of HIV among urban MSM  in the US  (39.5 per 100 MSM) . (2, 3, 5)Jackson also has the 
second highest A IDS rate and the 3rd highest rate of HI V infection for Black men under  age 25.(3) 
An ever -expandi ng number of young Black MSM in the U.S.  are becoming infected, and 
evidence suggests that the age of infection for these men is becoming progressively younger.(4) 
In a recent study of 600 young Black MSM (ages 15 through 29) conducted by [CONTACT_197841], MS, 23.3% tes ted positive for HIV (n = 140) and nea rly one third  were 21 
years of age or younger. Given the crisis of HIV/AIDS among young Black  MSM in South , this 
study will focus on its  youngest members , including those who may not yet identify as MSM 
(i.e., nHBAM).  
 Growing evidence suggests that non-hetero sexual  adolescent males  have 
increased rates of sexual risk and  face un ique risk factors  such as discrimination, 
internalized homophobia and disconnection from families and social networks . 
Longitudinal studies find that adolescent (MSM) AMSM were likely to have experienced 
homophobia and  sexual/social /racial  discrimination and these experiences are  significantly 
associated with substance use  and HIV sexual risk behaviors.(19, 20) Also, a nalyses of the Youth 
Risk Behavior Survey indicate that non -heterosexual adolescent males rep ort higher rates of 
sexual risk.(21) Other research , supports the relevance of stigma , heterosexual expectations of 
masculinity by [CONTACT_197842].(26-33) Addressing these factors during 
adolescence , and with the family members of adolescents,  may prove beneficial.  Evidence 
suggests that nHBAM  experience disapproval, discrimination, and homophobia in every arena 
of their lives (e.g., families, peers, racial /ethnic groups, faith communities).(22-28) Connectedness 
with family has  been found to be highly protective against drug use, HIV and other risky 
behaviors among young people in general , (29, 30) Often nHBAM  feel a sense of  disconnect ion 
and isolat ion from their families because of their sexuality.(22-24, 31 -33)  Further, nHBAM  may resist 
disclosure of their sexuality out of fear of rejection by [CONTACT_197843].(22, 31, 32, 34)  Family 
reactions to disclosure can r ange from anger or withdrawal,  (25, 35 -37) to tolerance or active 
support.(38) An intervention  is needed that will increase  positive connection s with family  
members  so that the adolescent can improve and strengthen  supports. An engaging and safe 
family -based interv ention may promote and sustain a healthier traje ctory for many 
nHBAM , who will continue to need support from a parent/caregiver.  
Interventions for a t-risk y outh can be effective if they are theory -based, tailored, 
and impact multiple domains . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_197791]  (AMSM) , there is 
substantial evidence that adolescents, even those at greatest risk, will reduce their risk for HIV 
and incre ase condom use in response to theory -driven  interventions.  A review of STI/HIV 
interventions for adolescents(39) found  that  two important ingredients of  effective int erventions: a 
direct link  to theory and intervention tailori ng. Interventi ons that include a broader  content, such 
as improving family p atterns, improving peer support , and enhancing gender and ethnic p ride, 
have also had a significant  behavioral impact .(40) MySTYLE will incorporate  these attributes.  
Parents and other caregivers  can be a source  of support and resilience  for non-
heterosexual  adolescent males  and may be available for interventions . Parental support  
Version 10 1/6/202 1

 and acceptance is associated with better sexual health for hetero and non -heterosexual youth ,(7) 
and lack of support is associated with  poor health outcomes.(41, 42) Cross -sectional studies 
indicate that positive f amily connections are advantageous  and even small improvements may 
be beneficial.(43) Two recent studie s of AMSM found an association between disclosure of same -
sex sexual  activity to parents and safer sex behaviors.(44, 45) Another study of AMSM found that 
parent – teen discussion about same -sex sexual behavior was associated with greater HIV 
testing.(46) In addition, p arental involvement may be more possible than previou sly thought. For 
example, Elze  found that 48% of non-heterosexual  adolescents  under the age of [ADDRESS_235156] parents contact[CONTACT_197844].(8) 
Because parents/caregivers continue to be involved after the intervention, a sustained impact 
may occur.(8)  
Family -based interventions can be effective , even for families in stress , and may 
prevent internalized homophobia . Fortunately, data from many parent and family -based 
prevention programs that target diverse  adolescents  health risks , including substance  use, 
mental health and violence , suggest that interventions can be effective . Program s can be 
efficacious even in distressed and at -risk families . Family -based interventions, including Project 
STYLE, are ef fective in reducing sexual risk in at-risk ( largely heterosexual) adolescents by 
[CONTACT_197845] , communication about sex , and monitorin g.(13, 47 -53) These 
interventions identify  areas of common agreement for each family to promote connection and 
shared values. Even for dist ressed families  who are  facing the challenge  of adolescent mental 
health , stigma, and substance use  disorders, interventions can  establish a common, 
collaborative framework . Intervention during adolescence, when self -esteem and family 
dynamics are not yet entrenched , may help prevent internalized homophobia and family 
alienation that is commonly reported later by  [CONTACT_197846] .(54)  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_197792]-heterosexual  adolescents  suggest that online interventions  
can be effective  and that parent s are inte rested and can be engaged . Four recent published  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_197793]  [two open trials  from the 1990s are not summarized  (55, 56)]. 
An online  100-minute multimedia  intervention  for non-hetero sexual  youth  was associated with 
improved safer sex and sexual orientation attitudes at posttest.(9) The online intervention was 
highly acceptable to yout h and , although the study lacked a comparison condition, the result s 
sugg est that an online intervention  can impa ct relevant attitudes. Unfo rtunately, behavior was 
not assess ed and families were not enrolled . Hidalgo (10) conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_32876]  101 young 
MSM (mean age 18) and found that the group intervention resulted in less sexual activity while 
using substances. Although the group format was “moderately acceptable,” only half of the 
sample attende d at least 50% of the ses sions. Huebner reported on a 35 -minute  video  designed 
to improve caregiver  behaviors towards LGB youth.(11) It was made available online and was 
viewed by 1,[ADDRESS_235157] reported that they had not received any formal 
support in dealing with their child’s sexuality and they found the video  to be helpful . 
Unfortunately, adolescents  were not targeted and behavior change was not assessed. In a 
clinical intervention, Diamond  adapted a  family -based treatment for suicidal non-heterosexual  
adolescents  to address parental concerns and reactions to their child’s sexual orien tation .(12) 
The small study found that intervention with adolescents and their parent s reduced  depressive 
symptoms. Parents were engaged, retained, and their anxiety about sexua l orientation reduced. 
The studies suggest that some parents  of non-heterosexual  adolescents may want help with 
their child’s sexu ality and can be engaged safely;  a short video can positively impact 
parent/ caregiver attitudes ; and online interventions are effective.  Given the HIV/AIDS crisis 
among Bl ack Americans in the southern US , having such a program available to willing parents 
and their non -heterosexual sons is an  important prevention initiative .    
INNOVATION  
Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235158] of its 
kind. The adaptation of STYLE into MySTYL E is highly innovative:  it will be designed through  
qualitative research to  strengthen  adolescent – parent  relationships, involve parent/caregivers in 
a design that is safe for  nHBAM adolescents, and it will be comprised of a sample of nHBAM 
experiencing a citywide epi[INVESTIGATOR_197794] . Additionally innovative 
is 1) that this is an  online  program thereby [CONTACT_197847] y scalable  for use by [CONTACT_29436] -based organizations and youth -serving 
organizations ; 2) the adap tation fo r nHBAM is valuabl e given the ever -decreasing  age of HIV 
acquisition among MSM . The addition of parent/caregiver involvement to improve family 
connectedness  will further prot ect nHBAM against HIV ; 3) it can be applied to all nHBAM  
(regardless of sexual behavior or age). This intervention t akes a developmentally sensitive and  
broader approach to sexuality , rather  than focusing exclusively on adolescent s identifying as  
MSM ; 4) parent /caregiver  involvement will be optimally safe – the project will not require 
adolescent s to reveal their sexual behavior to others ; 5) in contrast to other online interventions  
for AMSM ,(9) nHBAM  will be enrolled in -person  or digitally via HIPAA -compliant video 
conferencing platform  thereby [CONTACT_197848].  
 
PRELIMINARY STUDIES  
STYLE is  an efficacious, theory -based, face -to face family -based HIV prevention 
intervention (R01  MH63008 ) and has been  designated as a “best evidence” intervention 
for risk reduction by [CONTACT_6750] . We propose to adapt  STYLE  to be tailored specifically for 
nHBAM  and their parents/ caregivers . STYLE was developed  to reduce HIV risk among 
adolescents by [CONTACT_197849], relevant knowledge, family communication, and 
behavioral skills. Some activities were separate for adolescents and parents, and others were 
joint. The project promoted positive family connection s as a basis for improved sexua l 
communication and monitoring. The intervention was based on the Social Personal 
Framework  (SPF) , which expands on Social Learning Theory by [CONTACT_197850], contextual risk and protective factors.(13, 57) This f ramework specifies relationships 
that can be targeted  to reduce HIV risk (see Figure  1). It proposes that adolescent risk behavior 
is a function of personal attributes (e. g. knowledge, attitudes, self-esteem), psychological 
functioning (e.g. depressive symptoms, substance use, PTSD), fam ily context and parenting 
practices  of communication and monitoring of adolescent’s activities, peers and whereabouts , 
relationship concerns (e.g. peer and partner influence), and community fa ctors.  Adolescent HIV 
risk is most distally influenced by [CONTACT_197851] (i.e ., crime, poverty) . Family factors 
contribute to the development of adolescents’ sexual attitudes, behaviors and values, while  also 
influencing adolescent peer and partner relationships through monitoring  and parent -adolescent 
communication . Personal attributes and peer /partner  relationships  are two proximal factors that 
can directly influence adolescent HIV risk.  The SPF, which was u sed for STYLE, is a broad 
framework that can incorporate attitudes relevant for any intervention population and any health 
behavior. Any factor found to be relevant by [CONTACT_197852]. 
For example , homophobia (a personal at tribute of the teen, and an attitude of the parent) can be 
addressed by [CONTACT_197853]. Psychological factors of both adolescents and parents were signific ant areas of 
attention in  STYLE . The SPF was a useful framework to organize formative material a nd guide 
intervention developmen t. Psychological trauma, depressive sy mptoms and substance use (i.e. 
Personal Attributes) are possible risk factors for some nHBAMs. For parents, anxiety about their 
teen’s sexuality and consequent difficulty with parent – child communication (i.e. Fa mily 
Context) would likely be found in  formative work and be come  intervention targets.

STYLE reduced sexual risk in a sample of distressed, stigmatized youth . Its efficacy  was 
evaluated in a multi -site (Providence RI; Atlanta GA; Chicago IL) randomized clinical trial that 
included 721 adolescents  (60% Black)  in mental health treatment  and their caregivers . (13) 
STYLE, compared to a time and attention matched general health promotion condition, resulted 
in fewer unsafe sex acts  (adjuste d rate ratio= 0.49, p=.01), greater frequency of condom use 
(adjusted r elative change= 59%, p=.01 ), a greater likelihood of av oiding sex (adjusted odds 
ratio= 1.44, p=.05), improved HIV knowledge (p<.01) and greater HIV prevention self -efficacy 
(p<.05) three months after the intervention  and the effect was not moderated by [CONTACT_545] . There 
were also improvements, by [CONTACT_197854], in  effective parenting practices: more 
parental monitoring (p<.01), less parental permissiveness (p=.05)  and more pare nt-teen sexual 
communication (p<.01) . Subsequent analyses demonstrated  that the improv ements in family 
functioning were  evident six months after the intervention and that even highly distressed 
caregivers with mental health symptoms show ed improvement s in their parental functioning.(58) 
STYLE reduce d adolescent risk behavior and  improve d important parenting practices  
and connectedness  in families under stress.  Many caregivers were fearful, ashamed and 
openly hostile with their adolescent. STYLE was successful in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_197795] a foundation for change. Fifteen percent 
of the participating careg ivers were not the parents or legal guardians. Non-guardian  caregivers 
were nominated by [CONTACT_192386]. Caregivers included highly trusted family relatives (e.g. aunt, 
grandmother) or stable fam ily friends . We propose to use this  procedure  with MySTYLE.   
 A Video DVD o f STYLE ( R44MH082103 ) was effective  for Black community 
adolescents . Techniques and principles from STYLE formed the basis for the  development of a 
targeted,  interactive DVD  (“Work it Out Together” ) to reduce HIV risk among Black adolescents 
by [CONTACT_197849], relevant knowledge, and behavioral skills.  Similar to  STYLE , it focused 
on improving family communication,  connectedness, and  parental practices . The intervention 
was introduced by a 35 minute Novella , which can be viewed at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUjDLDNZYJY . It was dev eloped in conjunction with MEE 
Productions , which will develop the online multimedia content for this project . MEE i s a minority -
owned media company  specializing in the development of culturally appropriate learning videos 
for adolescents. The engaging novella provi ded a context in which to embed the intervention 
content . The  vignet tes involve d a teen couple, their cl ose 
friends, and  parents  and examined healthy and unhealthy 
behaviors . Adolescents and parents were  shown the 
same film to become eng aged in the story and outcomes . 
Scenes were replayed to emphasize points and to allow 
for personal reflection . Suggestions for “practice” were  
made to participant s but they decide d on when and what 
they practice d. On average, p articipants spent about 120 
minutes viewing the  DVD.  The DVD for Black adolescents 
addressed  both delay of sex/ return to abstine nce and 
 
Chapter 8  

Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235159], and tools to improve parenting practices (includ ing assertive communication and pa rental 
monitoring). In addition,  parents  were shown techniques on how to engage their adolescents in 
discussions about safer sex; both prior to and after adolescents have become sexually active. In 
the trial, 94% of adolescents  (41% sexually active)  and their caregivers  were retained at th ree 
months post -intervention . The program resulted in greater  adolescent HIV prevention self -
efficacy ( 42.58 vs . 40.35, t (158)  = 2.28, p =.02,) and greater condom use self -efficacy (49.10  
vs. 45.84, p =.04). Adults  reported more effective parenting practices: discussion s with 
adolescent (21.11 vs . 19.89 , p =.04) and parental monitoring (23.81 vs . 22.50, p =.04), with 
adolescent s also tending to report  greater parental monitoring  (20.90 vs . 19.24, p =.06).  
Methods for recruitment of nHBAM and parents have been tested in Jackson, MS  
and preliminary input on the intervention obtained .  In preparation for this proposed project, 
two focus groups with  16 of 17  identifying as nHBAM (mean age 16) and their 
parents /caregivers  were conducted. Seven of the adults were extended relatives or close family 
friends, which emphasizes the need to include other caregivers in the intervention, with approval 
from parents  (similar to STYLE). Participants said that HIV was a “huge problem” and parents 
said that they were very worried about their sons’ health and problems all of their relationships. 
Parents and teens thought that a mobile phone intervention with brief  novell a videos  similar to 
the STYLE DVD was novel and co uld easily reach participants. They  suggested that the 
program be called “Family Table Talk: Building Healthy Relationships for Straight and Gay 
Teens,” to emphasize the acceptance of sexual diversity  and to include material on improving 
non-sexual relationships, which is needed by [CONTACT_50634] . Participants thought that even if st raight 
teens enrolled that they would benefit because “accepting yourself helps you acce pt others,” 
and “we all need  families to understand us more,” and “ev en if a guy thinks he is  straight, he 
could still end up having sex with another guy later.”  Focus group participants were easily 
recruited by a research assistant familiar with the local MSM community, a school guidance 
counselor, and staff in the Adolescent Medicine Clinic. We will use similar recruitment methods 
in the proposed project, in addition t o participant referral  and response driven sampling , peer 
ambassadors,  flyers in CBOs and schools , and through targeted advertisements posted on 
various social media platforms (such as SnapChat, Instagram, and/or Twitter).  These methods 
will not result in sample that is perfectly representative of all nonheterosexual adolescent 
males, since enrolled parents  and teens  will be  amenable to the intervention . However, it 
will provide valuable data on the feasibility and acceptability of a media -based 
interventio n for families who desire assistance in protecting their sons against HIV 
acquisition.  
 
APPROACH  
Please note : In the Approach section, we use the term parent  to refer to the legal 
guardian of the adolescent and caregiver  to refer to any  family member  or trusted, involved 
adult.  
Overview.  The project  will use formative work  to adapt  the family -based  Project  STYLE  
and its media material  to the needs  of non-heterosexual  Black adolescent males ( nHBAM ) and 
their parents/ caregivers  in Jackson MS, the urban area with the highest prevalence rate of HIV 
among MSM in the US (39.5 per 100 MSM).(2, 3, 5) In preparation for this project, we recruited [ADDRESS_235160]. Mena . As suggested in our focus groups in Jackson, the 
Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235161] will be called “Family Table Talk: Building Healthy Relationships for Straight and Gay 
Teens, ” or something similar , so that we will enroll adolescents and parents/caregivers who 
indicate interest in healthy adolescent relationships and acceptance of straight and gay 
adolescents . The project will not require adolescents to reveal the ir sexual behavior or att itudes. 
We expect that the majority of youth who participate will be  non-heterosexual, similar to our 
focus groups.  
Year 1 will include  formative work  using  three focus groups  interviews with 
approximately 15 nHBAM , 15 parents/caregiver s, and 15 interviews of stakeholder from staff 
such as schools, LGBT -friendly  organizations, churches and state agencies . Using the ADAP -
ITT model(59) and other models of digital intervention adaptation ,(60) findings  from the Year [ADDRESS_235162], and the media development  company  (MEE  Productions,  see 
Facilities  and Other  Resources) . Year 2  will culminate  in the creation  of MySTYLE,  an 8-session 
online  intervention program that will use an engaging  novella  to increase  motivation  and skills  
that support  healthy  sexual  behavior,  communication,  and family  processes  (connectedness  and 
parent  practices) for nHBAM and their parents/caregivers.  MySTYLE  will be tested  for feasibility 
and effect size in a small Randomized Trial Phase in Year [ADDRESS_235163] control .  
At the completion of the study,  up to 30  interested participants  (youth and parents)  will be asked

adult c aregiver for the  past [ADDRESS_235169] the city or caregiver  in the next 8 
months ). We understand that this will preclude homeless youth who may be at risk  for HIV but 
MySTYLE will not be designed to address the numerous structural need of chronically  homeless 
youth ; 3) the ability to read and speak English; 4) identify  as a male; 5) and identify raci ally as 
Black African American. Exclusion criteria will be: a) not able to provide meaningful  assent  as 
determined by [CONTACT_3647], b) known HIV -infection ( staff will facilitate entry into care  if 
needed ). Although we expect that most enrolled youth with be nHBAM, heterosexual youth who 
enroll will be able to complete all intervention activities.  Eligibility criteria for Parents/caregivers  
for all phases of the project  will be: 1 ) parent /caregiver or trusted a dult of an adolescent who is 
potentially  eligible fo r enrollment into the study ; and 2 ) English speaking. In addition to the 
aforementioned criteria, participants who have completed the MySTYLE intervention activities 
will be invited to participate in an exit interview or focus group (via a video conferencing platform 
or in-person, if safe to do so). These methods will not result in sample that is perfectly 
representative of all nonheterosexual adolescent males, since enrolled parents and teens will be 
amenable to the intervention.  However,  it will provide valuable data on the feasibility and 
acceptability of a media -based intervention for families who desire assistance in protecting their 
sons against HIV acquisition. It will reflect the population that would become recipi[INVESTIGATOR_197797].   
 Recruitment . Our team has successfully recruited and retained at-risk adolescents and 
MSM and these methods will guide our project . The severity of the HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_197798] (see letters of 
support).  As suggested in our focus groups in Jackson, the project will  be called “Family Table 
Talk: Building Healthy Relationships for Straight and Gay Teens, ” or something similar.   We will 
enroll adolescents and parents/caregivers who indicate interest in healthy adolescent 
relationships and acceptance of straight and gay adolescents. The project will not require 
adolescents to reveal their sexual behavior or attitudes . The project  will use two experienced 
community recruiters with close ties to adolescent and LGBT relevant CBOs (My Brother ’s 
Keeper,  the Teen Program of Mississippi [INVESTIGATOR_197799], GSA of Jackson,  see Resources ), agencies / 
clinics (adolescent health, HIV and STI clinics , and schools (via referral from  school health and 
guidance counselors). Recruiters will publicize the project to youth at agency functions  and with 
flyers /social media announcements . The agencies and schools will also direct potentially at -risk 
youth to the project . We will also utilize targeted advertisements posted on online social media 
platforms (e.g. SnapChat, Instagram, and/or Twitter) to recruit nHBAM.  Referrals and 
advertisements will provide the  contact [CONTACT_197855], who will 
promptly initiate contact  [CONTACT_197856] . Our Advisory Board , 
peer ambassadors  and currently enrolled  participant s will also assist in recruitment . Currently 
enrolled participants wi ll be incentivized to recruit up to five new participants and will receive an 
additional $10 for each referral that is enrolled in the study.  The Jackson urban area has a 
population of 574,9 98; 26% are under the age of 18,  48% are male, half are adolescents, and 
5% will identify as non -heterosexual .(64) Based on these estimates, we will be recruiting a total of 
97 non-heterosexual Black adolescent males (nHBAM) for all phase s of the project from a pool 
of at least 1,[ADDRESS_235170].

 funded RCTs, with 1 -year retention from 75 to 86%.(13, 61, 65, 66) His enrollment has targeted 
diverse youth including youth in mental health treatment, in alternative school settings, in 
community -based organizations, or in juvenile justice facilities. Drs. Mena  and Crosby [CONTACT_197858] [ADDRESS_235171] in Jackson, MS.(63, 67, 68) 
 Enrollment . For both the formative ph ase and the RCT we will enroll balanced numbers 
of participants  by [CONTACT_654]  (≤16, >16).  
 In the Formative phase , interested nHBAM  will be asked to give our study team 
permission (and contact [CONTACT_3031]) to enroll their respective  parent s/caregiver s to: 1) provide 
written informed consent for those under 18 and 2) to also participate in the project . The project 
will be described as an  intervention developi[INVESTIGATOR_197800] y relationships in Black adolescent males  
and to increase acceptance  for hetero and hetero teens ; it will not disclose the adolescent’s 
private behaviors or attitudes; and will not require adolescents to disclose any sexual 
behavior .  
In the Formative phase , Parents will be contact[CONTACT_197859].  If the parent (legal guardian) agrees to  their son’s participation 
in the project but does not want to participate, the parent and adolescent can nominate 
“someone important in the life of the adolescent such as other family, teacher, religious leader, 
or soc ial worker” who will be contact[CONTACT_197860]. Caregivers will not be enrolled in lieu of a 
parent unless the parent agrees . This option  of involving a caregiver , rather than a parent , 
worked well in Project STYLE , and involving a  non-parental adult  was recently recommended as 
an intervention option for non-heterosexual adolescents .(69) Even if a  parent/caregiver never 
participates in the intervention, MySTYLE, may improve the family climate  by [CONTACT_197861] , similar to other studies finding an impact without all family 
members attending sessions.(70) 
See RCT Phase  for details on enrollment for tha t phase.  
 
Formative phase (PY01).  Aim 1:  To use interviews with nHBAM , parents/caregivers, and other 
stakeholders (e.g. staff from schools and re levant organizations) to identify  the relevant 
elements needed for a family -based intervention for nHBAM  and their parents/caregivers.  
[Appendix 1] Focus groups with  nHBAM , caregiver s, and stakeholder s will address the relevant 
elements needed to adapt o ur family -based  intervent ion. Theme s will be identified as  to how the 
family and community environments of nHBAM  have influenced their HIV -related knowledge, 
attitudes and behavior ( KAB). All data will be organized using the Social Perso nal Framework  
allowing the impact of family /community  influences to be ex amined in relation to KAB.  In 
addition,  focus groups  (of nHBAM , caregivers, and stakeholders) will be designed to  elicit 
insights on  the design , content, and tailoring  of MySTYLE. The findings will inform Aim 2 
(development of MySTYLE)  and will also solicit interest in becoming a member in the 
intervention development Work Groups.  
Focus groups  of nHBAM . The t hree focus groups with ≈15 total nHBAM will begin with 
a screening of segments of  our MEE -developed videos , as a prompt to explore  factors re levant 
to nHBAM in each scene . Scenarios will deal with all of the preliminary, draft content area such 
as the spectrum of adolescent sexua l development, relevance of HIV,  stigma  and poor self -
esteem, assertive communication and privacy co ncerns with parents and peers, challenges with 
parental/caregiver support, sexual safety, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_197801], depression, and trauma (see Intervention Conditions in RCT Phase belo w). The MEE video 
clips are primarily heterosexual but address all of these topi[INVESTIGATOR_197802] a group of Black 
teenagers with different families, areas of conflict , and types of support. Group members will be 
asked:  “Is the topic you just saw relevant to the  typi[INVESTIGATOR_197803] (or  not 
fully heterosexual) ?” and “What other things  could be added ?” and “Did the character s sound 
realistic?”  Because teens are not  speaking personally, this technique can  create  trust and 
rapport . Next, a n informal  version of  the nominal group process  will be used to increase 
Version 10 1/6/202 1 
12 
 participation . The group will consider  how the content  is influenced by [CONTACT_197862]  (personal attitudes , family, peers / partners, and community /structural) in 
relation to their KAB . Each adolescent will receive four  color-coded  cards that wil l signal 
whether  they believe a  topic area is a product of: a) their personal thinking (b lue card), b) 
influenced by [CONTACT_3654] (red card), c) influenced by  [CONTACT_197863]/sex partners (green card)  or d) 
influenced by [CONTACT_197864] (yellow card) . Adolescents  may hold up one, or more  cards 
at a time . Probes will explore race, stigma, culture , and age interact with family, peers and the 
community in all content area . For instance, if several tee ns indicate that families “have 
influence over the overall mental health a nd happi[INVESTIGATOR_008] ” of nHBAM,  then further probes could  
include: “How could parents show gay teens support?” and “What are gay  or undecided teens , 
afraid of the most in talking with parents? ” “How is it different depending on age? Or if you have 
an older friend that your parent does not trust?”  This final se gment will assess the priorities for  
intervention content  (especially as influenced by [CONTACT_197865]) , additional needed 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] , and the best  methods  for intervention delivery. We will also solic it ideas  as to the most 
effective methods for recruitment and retention .  
Focus groups of parents/ caregivers . Three focus groups with ≈15 total  
parents/ caregivers  will assess their views and personal perceptions regarding : 1) Intervention 
content tha t is relevant and acceptable , 2) preferred formats of  intervention delivery, and 3) 
effective recruitment methods for  parents /caregivers . Staff will solicit feedback in two broad 
areas – the needs of nHBAB  and the needs of their parents . Similar to the adolescent focus 
groups  parents  will begin wit h a modified theatre testing exercise prompted by  [CONTACT_197866] -produced 
video clips. We will use the same techniques and questions as with  adolescents. Questions will 
be designed to elicit responses in three categories: 1) what parents want most from this type of 
program, 2) fears or concerns they have about being part of the program, and 3) suggestions on 
specific content for parent -related  and teen -related  aspects of the program. Probes will examine 
parents’ sexual norms, sexual knowledge,  their perception of community sexual/social/racial 
discrimination, and areas of conflict, acceptance, and support in the family . A closing segment 
will a sk parents about their thoughts on how we can optimize our recruitment and retention 
methods.  
Individual and group interviews  of st akeholders . Whereas the focus group sessions 
with teens and parents will be quite similar in structure and content, interviews with stakeholders 
will be much different. Because we are defining “key stakeholders” as people who are directly 
providing sexual health servi ces to teens in Jackson, the [ADDRESS_235172] a 
wealth of ideas and opi[INVESTIGATOR_197804] (for both teens and parents), 
intervention methods, and recruitment/retention methods. Thus, the interview guide for 
stakeholders wi ll be centered on eliciting views and ideas regarding the primary socio -sexual 
issues that nHBAM face in Jackson . Questions will be generic at first and progressively become 
more specific. For instance, an ea rly question will be: “Plea se tell us about levels of acceptance 
of non-heterosexual males in high schools in Jackson  and in the community .” A later question 
would  be: “Can you also please describe your thoughts or experiences with parents as an 
influence on  prejudice or discrimination about  not being f ully heterosexual?” Other items item 
would  be: “Are some parents highly accepting of a son ’s non -heterosexual orientation?” and 
“What  factors influence parents’ degree of acceptance ?” Because stakeholders are community 
professionals, we anticipate that they will be very eager to offer ideas and thus we hesitate to 
overly -structure the sessions (as doing so would constrain the otherwise in -depth value of the 
interview).  
Interview relia bility. Interview guides will contain detailed protocols for administration. 
Two trained staff members will conduct each focus group . They will be trained  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Brown  to 
use skills such as reflective listening, probing, and the use of vignettes to promote  thought and 
discussion. This training will also involve  techniques from theatre testing such as eliciting 
dialogue pertaining to content, message presentation and its  framing. Consistency will be

Analysis Plan (Aim 1). Identify factors relevant to HIV prevention and  family -based 
intervention delivery. Interviews will be audio -recorded and transcribed. We will use the Rapid  
Approach  to examining  all interview  data,  which  is appropriate  when  interview  topi[INVESTIGATOR_197805].(71) The data will  be aggregated using the Social Personal Framework  (see Preliminary 
Studies) thus allowing the impact of family , peer and structural community  influences to be 
examined in relation to adolescent attitudes and behavior. The data will suggest the  ways in 
which family, peers, and community influence sexual sa fety for nHBAM and how  the healthy 
influences can be augmented and unhealt hy ones lessened. The data will  guide the final 
content development of MySTYLE and the novellas. Also, we will  examine whether any sample 
composition factors  (e.g. age)  require attention; identify pragmatic issues such as how to best 
recruit and retain nHBAM  and their caregivers ; and the best methods to deliver the intervention . 
Drs. Brown and Crosby  [CONTACT_197868].  For example,  Brown  completed  a 
mixed methods  study  of a culturally  tailored  STI/HIV  prevention  campaign  for African  
American  teens  with a TV/radio  media  component  (IMPACCS,  U01 MH066785)(72) and the 
methods are similar to that used to create the STYLE DVD with the media company .  
 
Program Development (Year 2) . Aim 2:  To use the ADAPT -ITT Model  in an iterative 
approach between our investigators, the Community Advisory B oard , and a media 
company  to refine the family -based MySTYLE and its media material . The ADAPT -ITT mode l 
is specifically designed for adapting HIV -prevention programs. (59) Briefly, the model begins wit h 
a qualitative  phase  (Aim 1)  and proceeds to  the intervention development workgroup . The 
workgroup will consist of  our Community Advisory Board  (4 nHBAM, 4 parents/caregivers, 
and 4 community members , see above in Research Partners ) and the three investigators.  The 
workgroup  will use the interview  findings to  inform the language, approaches, interactive 
components, and contextual d etails of the intervention . A nominal group process will be 
employed to facilitate balan ced decision -making; consensus bu ilding will be the priority of each  
meeting . Workgroup meet ings will be held month ly or more frequently  to use themes from 
interviews to build storyboards (i.e.  video production  draft) that will  be used for the development 
of brief video novell as by [CONTACT_197869] . [CONTACT_46792] has used this process 
successfully in adapting two efficaci ous interventions into digital media self -guided interventions 
that completed the formative work and t he video production in less than two years 
(R44MH082103; R44MH102140 ). 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_197806] e intervention  acceptability . The full “beta” version  of 
MySTYLE  sessions will be tested with a new cohor t of 10 nHBAM and 10 parents/ caregivers  for 
acceptability and relevance of content and feasibility of the procedures. The Workgroup 
members  will view and rate the full “beta” version of MySTYLE sessions.  Participants  and 
Workgroup members will complete the Session Evaluation Form (73) and the Client  Satisfaction 
Questionnaire(74) to assess the clarity, relevance and appeal of the activities and their reactions 
to the sessions ( Appendix 2). Mean scores of [ADDRESS_235174] Phase (Year  3) Aim 3:  To conduct a preliminary test of the efficacy of MySTYLE 
compared to a waitlist control  on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors  of 72 nHBAM and their 
parents/car egivers . 
 
Procedures : This two -arm randomized controlled trial will have an [ADDRESS_235175] and a later follow -up (baseline, 2, and  4-month assessments ) to 
Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235176] of MySTYLE.  
 
nHBAM  Enrollment:  In the RCT phase, a waiver of parental consent will be requested  for 
those under [ADDRESS_235177] to youth at agency functions 
and with flyers/social media announcements. The agencies and schools will also direct 
potentially at -risk youth to the project. We will also continue to utilize targeted advertisements 
posted on onl ine social media platforms (e.g. SnapChat, Instagram, and/or Twitter) to recruit 
nHBAM.  Our Advisory Board , peer ambassadors  and currently enrolled participant s will also 
assist in recruitment.  Currently enrolled participants will be incentivized to recrui t up to five new 
participants and will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_235178]  with the y outh and use the waiver of parental consent to enroll 
the youth if he is interested . 
 
Digital consent , enrollment , and follow -up: In light of the COVID -19 outbreak, several of our 
recruitment sites (i.e. CBOs, clinics, and schools) have either closed or are limiting non -
essential visits. This limitation severely impacts our ability to recruit and enroll potential 
participants in -person for the RCT phase of this project. We are proposing to offer digital 
consent and enrollment via HIPAA -compliant platforms (i.e. DocuSign , HIPAA -compliant video 
conferencing platforms ). nHBAM identified as eligible, based on an online REDCap screener, 
will be asked if they would like to be contact[CONTACT_66696]. Those  that indicate they would like 
to be contact[CONTACT_197870], email address, and phone number. 
UMMC research assistants will follow up with interested parties b y phone or email. Those who 
wish to participate will receive a Docu Sign consent form via email from the UMMC research 
assistant and will be given the opportunity to participate in a video conference call (via HIPAA -
compliant video conferencing platform  with the UMMC research assistant to review the consent 
form. The DocuSign  consent form will outline study aims and procedures and contains language 
regarding the risks/benefits of participating in a research study. The online survey data will be 
de-identified  and kept in a password -protected participant log on a secure server. Participants 
will be given ample time to consider risks of participation and will have the opportunity to ask 
questions during the video conference. Participants will also be reminded th at study 
participation is voluntary and that refusing to participate or withdrawing from the study at any 
time will not result in any negative consequences. For the remaining follow -up appointments (at 
2- and [ADDRESS_235179] control 
participants) participants will be emailed their online REDCap surveys and will receive online gift 
cards for each completed survey. At the [ADDRESS_235180].  
 
Parent or caregiver enrollment : The RCT allows nHBAM  into the program before 
parent/caregiver involvement is requested (with a waiver of parental consent  for those 
under 18) and then prepares nHBAM  to safely involve their parent , if possible. More 
detailed information on the process is shown in the schemati c below. nHBAM  aged 18 or older  
Version 10 1/6/202 1 
15 
 will be able to provide their own consent, although we will ask for permission to enroll 
parents/caregivers , if possible and safe for the youth. The project will be described as a general 
sexual health intervention for adolescent males; it will not disclose the adolescent’s private 
behaviors or attitudes and will not require adolescents to disclose any personal information.   
 
Parent/Caregiver involvement may begin  at study  entry , at the middle  of the intervention  
or immediately after the 8 -week intervention , after  the nHBAM  has had more time to 
consider it.  Parents/ caregivers will be assigned to the same condition as their 
adolescents .

 a.)  These adolescents are likely to have highly supportive parents who enroll as well . nHBAM  
will give consent for their study enrollment and permission for the study to contac t parents for 
their participation.  
b.) These adolescents may nominate  up to  4 caregivers – the project director may then obtain 
parental consent and parent engagement (less likely than “a’) or parental consent and parental 
agreement for caregiver to enroll in place of the parent. nhBAM aged 18 or older will be able to 
give consen t for caregivers to enroll but caregiver enrollment is not required.  
c.) We will not pressure these adolescents to allow us to make this contact – their reticence is a 
clear sign that a waiver of parental consent is warranted for safety reasons . 
d.) As a result of intervention efforts nHBAM  from “c” are asked again at mid-intervention  and at 
the end of the intervention  for permission to contact a parent – those agreeing may then have 
that parent become engaged in the study.  
e.) As a result of intervention e fforts  nHBAM  from “c” are asked again at mid-intervention  and at 
the end of the intervention  for permission to contact a parent – some may agree only for the 
purpose of gaining parental permission to involve one of four nominated caregivers in the study. 
nHBAM  aged 18 or older  will be able to give consent for caregivers to enroll but caregiver 
enrollment is not required.  
f.) These adolescents will continue under a waiver of parental consent if under 18 and do so 
without a parent or caregiver being engaged.  Adolescents age d 18 or older  continue under their 
own consent.   
 
Randomization : Immediately after completing baseline assessment, s mall block randomization  
(via REDCap ) will create groups balanced on age and on the proport ion who identify as 
nHBAM . We estimate that 90%  of those enrolled will  be nHBAM . 72 participants  will provide  
suffic ient power for the analyses (see Data Analysis). Recruitment will continue until 72 
nHBAM are enrolled . 
 
Format : Immediately after randomization, p articipants  (adolescents  and parents/caregivers)  in 
the active (MySTYLE) condition  will receive two secure, HIP AA compliant texts or emails  to their 
mobile phones  or preferred indicated device each week for ei ght weeks  and e ach text /email  will 
contain  a link  to new media content  (overall, at least  [ADDRESS_235182] conducted by [CONTACT_197873] ).(9) The weekly content, as well other content and 
interact ive materials , will be available on their condition’s  secure website.  All nHBAM  and 
enrolled parents/car egiver s will each have their own links with separate , but parallel , content 
(see Figure below in Intervention  Condition s). Those participants assigned to the waitlist  will be 
eligible to participate in MySTYLE after they have completed their [ADDRESS_235183], study staff will not engage with the parent.  
 
Intervention fidelity and u sage : The twice -weekly video/graphic content will be embedded in the 
participant’s uniqu e REDCap  link, providing data on the number of videos viewed by [CONTACT_37117]. The participant will not proceed to the next web page (containing options for their 
weekly practice, etc.) until the video has fully played, but it may be paused and resumed later. The 
videos/ graphics will be posted on the website for  repeat viewing. Analytics will  be collected on the 
number of minutes enrolled nH BAM  spend viewing project materials , the content accessed, and 
the number o f times any one video was re -played.

 Retention : Collectively, our research team has  1-year retention rates greater than 80% for  
young MSM and adolescents. In an on-going RCT in MS, Crosby [CONTACT_197874] 600 
Black MSM  (ages 15 to 29) and 3 -month retention  for those under 20 is 98% and [CONTACT_46792] ’s 1-
year have ranged from retention rates have ranted  75 to 86%.(13, 61, 65, 66) Formative work and 
prior experience will inform our retention strategies. Effective techniques include (1) collecting 
primary and secondary phone/text numbers, e -mail addresses, and social media names at all 
assessments , (2) maintaining a primary staff contact [CONTACT_197875], (3) a convenient 
assessme nt location, and (3) assessment reimbursements appropriate to the community 
standards. Retention efforts will be aided by [CONTACT_2363] a locally developed Access tracking 
database, including (1) specification of visit schedule, (2) generation of target dates for 
assessment based on protocol, (3) tracking of assessment instruments complet ed by [CONTACT_765], (4) 
linkage of participants with research assistant staff, (5) specification of completed and missed 
visits, (6) notes attached to each participant and visit, and (7) generation of customizable 
reports. All data in the tracker are easily expor ted to statistical packages, for easy linkage with 
other study data, which supports efficiency in data management activities.  
 
 
MySTYLE Intervention Condition  
 
MySTYLE  is online, brief  and encourages parent -adolescent communication about sex 
and HIV prevention . The formative research phase will determin e the final content/format of 
MySTYLE but the earlier projects of STYLE and the interactive DVD will inform the proposed 
intervention ai ms, content, and techniques. Qualitati ve work from these projects suggested  the 
intervention should be easily accessible  (online), brief (each segment lasting only a few 
minutes), and encourage personal practice . Adolescents and parents want the topi[INVESTIGATOR_197807]  (“I’m worried my son  is into drugs and sex but I can’t talk to hi m because we 
fight all the time. ” Or “ My parents don’t need to know my business!” ) MySTYL E will have three 
main targets : (1) Improved sexual health  (with relevant information, motivation, skills) ; (2) 
increased acceptance of non -heterosexual ity by [CONTACT_197876]/caregivers ; (3) 
Improved parent – adolescent relations hips based on improved  communication, 
connectedness and parent ing practices . MySTYLE will have many factors to sustain its  
impact : (1) Multilevel approach which engages  parents/caregivers ; (2) Online for ease of 
access and repeat viewing ; (3) Novella to enhance  relevance for  youth and parents/care givers ; 
(4) Behavioral pr actice to improve self -efficacy; (5) Social media elements  to improve social 
supports ; (6) Access to local resources ; (7) Easily updated  if new information or resources 
become available .   
Session 1 will be a 7 -10 minute novella introducing participants to an ongoing story that 
will be continued for 8 weeks. The engaging story, created with a sophisticated health media 
company ( MEE productions; http://www.meeproduct ions.com/ , see above or Facilities ) will show 
interactions between three Black adolescent males, their families, friends and potential sexual 
partners. Novellas will feature communication, relationships and behavior that are healthy and 
unhealthy. Novellas will be relevant to participants, seek to improve social support, and to 
provi de motivation for, and modeling of, healthy behaviors. The novella will be suitable and 
engaging for both nHBAM  and parents/caregivers, so the intervention provides a common 
ground for both. Content will be tailored for the adolescents and also for the par ents/caregivers. 
Adolescents and parents/caregivers will have similar content (e.g. HIV/AIDS facts), but also 
content that is specifically for them ( e.g. Peer pressure for adolescents  and Effective parenting 
practices for parents). The online intervention can be viewed and completed by [CONTACT_197877]/caregiver on their own. Some novella content will encourage communication in the 
family , which we will assess at follow -up assessments.  
The first text each wee k will be a continuation  of the novell a. The relevance of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_197808] 10 1/6/202 1

 for that week  and their healthy/unhealthy aspects will be shown in the novella. The second text 
will provide follow -up content to reinforce and amplify the message and allow time for personal 
reflection. M aterial will emphasiz e the knowledge, attitudes and behavioral message of the 
novella (the “take home message s”), which  will be narrated by [CONTACT_197878]. A  brief 
novella clip  will emphasize the point and/or the character will explain their thoughts, feelings or 
the anticipated consequences of their action. Each week , participant s will chose a behavior 
(“practice ex ercise” ) that they can do in the next week. Practice  choices  of participants and their 
subsequent utility ratings m ay be tabulated and viewed online  to reinforce “pract ice” and group 
participation .  
Content and format in interventions will be guided by [CONTACT_197879]. MySTYLE is 
proposed to include topi[INVESTIGATOR_197809] 1 . The novella will introduce HIV as personally relevant  to one of the 
characters, while others are unconcerned “because it can be treated.” Variations in sexual 
interest and development will be portrayed , as well as  common  family and community reactions. 
Parents will explore ways to “find common ground and areas of acceptance ” with their 
adolescent  even when upset with their teen’s sexuality. Parents will identify their personal 
concern, find their own supports and r efocus the ways they can immediately support their child.  
Parents will also see examples of effective parenting practices  in supportive communication  
and monitoring , which includes setting expectations, tracking activities and companions, and 
providing con sequence s. Both parents and nHBAM  will view material on condom use, HIV/STI 
testing and treatment , and pre -exposure prophylaxis . Characters in the novella will experience 
fear of infection and find that STI testing is an essential element in self -care and also a 
“teachable moment” that heightens  awareness of risk and protective  behaviors . Several novella 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_197810] -adolescent  communication. nHBAM will 
be encoura ged to pi[INVESTIGATOR_197811], and to use the assertive 
techniques that they are learn ing. Parents will see families in the novellas that are able to move 
from fear and disengagement to support of their adolescent and being an “ally in health.”  
Stigma, trauma, mental health issues and substance use will be topi[INVESTIGATOR_197812]. 
Their impact on health and behavior will be demonstrated so that t he topi[INVESTIGATOR_197813]. The texts will provide novella examples of effective copi[INVESTIGATOR_197814]. Links will be provided to local resources  for nHBAM -relevant support, 
mental health / substance use treatment,  medical care (e.g. routine care, STI/HIV testing, 
PrEP), family support (e.g. PFLAG ), and vocational/educational assistance. Parents/caregivers  
and nHBAM will contemplate their life and family goals  early in the intervention and then return 
to those goals  to update them and plan for the future. All of the material will be online after the 
participant has viewed it (along with supplemental materials and links) so that it may be 
reviewed anytime. [Appendix [ADDRESS_235184] online supplemental material.]  
  
Potential Challenges.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 72 nHBAM in Year 3  will be monitored and treated as 
if it were a large -scale trial. This will optimize our ability to learn from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_197815], efficacy trial. Three points will be prioritized:  (1) Recruitment 
will be clo sely monitored, thus emerging issues , such as less than 90% of nHBAM in sample,  
will be identified and recruitment will be addressed . (2) Delivery of online content to be 
confiden tial. Participants will receive the text/link to their personal phone or emai l address  and 
the links will not be able to be forwarded and content will not be downloadable . Adolescents  
could let others view the content on their device or show them the intervention’s password 
protected website, leading to mild contamination . Thus, we will assess exposure to in tervention 
content at follow -up to account for it. (3) Cel l phone  and email access  is nearly universal  (75) but 
if a nHBAM does not have this access , we will provide a smartph one and service plan  at no 
Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235185]. (4) The RCT timeline is ambitious.  The intervention is conducted using texts, which can be 
automated, so the limiting factor is recr uitment. Our revised protocol  does  not have specific 
criteria for sexual behavior or or ientation, so recruitment will  be easier , as evide nced by [CONTACT_197880] . Also, we will begin  the RCT earlier  (last quarter of PY02) to optimize the 
time available for its completion in PY03.  
 
Measures  for the  Randomized Trial  
 Nonheterosexual orientation : Because youth are enrolling in a project to promote 
Straight – Gay Acceptance, we anticipate that nearly all will be nonheterosexual, that is they will 
identify with at least  one of the following categories: a) have had at least one non -coercive 
intimate sexual experience (e.g., prolonged kissing, oral sex, anal sex) with a male, b) expect to 
someday have a male sex partner, c) sexually aroused by [CONTACT_197881], or d) self -
identify as gay, bisexual, gender -queer, or other term that is not heterose xual.  
In addition to determining feasibility and acceptability of MySTYLE, the purpose of the small RCT 
conducted is to determine effect size differences in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors . Given 
the reality of effect decay and the constraints of the R 34, we will use only two follow -up 
assessments at [ADDRESS_235186] control 
condition will also complete assessments at 6 and 8 months.  Scale score outcomes  include 
relevant knowledge  (e.g. HIV/ STIs),  attitudes  (e.g. internalized stigma, condom attitudes) and 
behavior  (e.g. prevention self -efficacy, parental monitoring  of teens’ activities and companions , 
and practice exercises ) (see Appendix 2 ). Scales will be adapted for nHBAM from those used in 
STYLE or by [CONTACT_197882]. Table 1 summarizes o ur central measures, as a function of the 
Social Personal Framework, and others may be added as needed based on our formative work . 
Behavioral outcomes  are: (1) the number of condomless  sex acts  during the follow -up period, 
(2) the rate of onset of sexual activity  and (3 ) the acceptance of a n HIV test . Sexual behaviors, 
HIV testing history and STI history will be assessed in a compute r-assisted self -interview  
designed specifically for use with adolescents and using branching logic so that they  only answer 
items that are relevant . (76-78) As a dependent variable, a dolescents will be offered  a free point -of-
care (POC) HIV test at 4. Also, self -report of prior HIV and STI testing will be assessed. Those 
who are not yet sexually active may decide against HIV testing and we will analyze the 
differences in testing rates separately based on self -report of sexual activity. Our outcome is 
testing, rather than the HIV or STI results because rates of infection will likely be low at this age, 
although the study will provide data on this issue in our high -prevalence city  of Jackson, MS . 
Intervention conte nt acceptability : At 2 or 6 months , depending on assigned condition , 
adolescents will complete the CSQ (see Year 2) to assess releva nce and utility of the content and 
to aid in refinement of the intervention, if needed, prior to a  subsequent, larger RCT.  
Location : Assessments of adolescents  at baseline , 2 months,  4 months , and 6 months 
(waitlist only) and 8 months (waitlist only)  will occur in person in a safe, convenient location at 
the Jackson Medical Mall or the Jackson Medical Tower. Both locations are easily accessible 
and used by [CONTACT_197883], which avoids stigma . Mode : REDCap  is a CASI system  that 
is HIPPA -compliant  and meets HITECH security and privacy requirement ( Appendix 4 ).   
Parent/Caregiver Outcomes . All assessments for parents/caregivers will occur online, 
using the same REDCap  software provided to adolescents.  Parents will complete a parental 
version of all eight  Family and Relationship scales in Table 1  (there is separate adolescent 
version of each scale) , as well as measures of acceptability at 2 or 6 months  (CSQ)  depending 
on assigned condition .

POST -TEST INTERVIEWS  
Post -test Interviews  will examine the overall perceptions of participants  as to how each 
module could be improved for greater appeal to other young males of a similar age and 
background as well as the attributions of youth regarding which modules (if any) had an impact 
on their sexual risk behaviors  
 In the final year, we will conduct interviews  or focus groups  of up to 30 participants  
(youth and parents)  from the RCT phase . These data will be used to inform later adaptation  of 
the intervention. Participants that have completed the intervention will be invited to complete a 
remote  or in-person (if safe to do so)  individual interview or focus group. [CONTACT_46792] , Crosby , 
Mena or a trained senior research associate, who has experience with post -intervention 
interviews, will do all interviews. Interviews will be not audio -recorded.  Instead,  as a structured 
interview , the staff member(s) conducting the interview will take copi[INVESTIGATOR_197817], on paper, during 
the one -hour session. These paper records will not be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_530], scanned, or transcribed to a 
digital system in any way whatsoever.  Participant interviews  or focus groups  will target 
Version 10 1/6/202 1 
21 
 Intervention characteristics (e.g. “What module content or storylines  did you find 
important/unimportant ?” “What were your overall perceptions of how each module could be 
improved for greater appeal to other young males who you know ?”, “What i mpact did the 
specific module content have on your sexual risk behaviors, including intentions to have sex?” ).  
We will use the Rapid  Approach  methodology  to examine these  data,  which  is appropriate  
when  topi[INVESTIGATOR_197818].67 This methodology organize s the major themes and identif ies their 
strong or weak associations.68 
DATA ANALYSIS PLAN  
Data will be collected using the electronic data capture portal REDCap , and extracted for 
entry to statistical programs (e.g.,  SPSS). S yntax will be developed to arrange the data for 
analysis. Data will be extracted and archived on a monthly basis. Routine s for assessing data 
integrity will be developed, with procedures established for accepting, correcting, or rejecting 
data. All data will reside on servers behind firewalls (with access restricted to study personnel) 
and on computers with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_197819]. All servers are routinely backed daily (to off -
site locations). T ransfer of data will be done using secure methods (e.g., secure FTP).  
Analysis Plans for Aims 1 and 2 – see Formative Work earlier in this application.  
Analysis Plan (Aim 3).  Enrollment will continue until 72 nHBAM are randomized 
Hypothesis : Among the [ADDRESS_235187] fewer 
condomless  sex acts  (CSAs) , a less onset of sexual activity, and greater HIV testing rates, 
compared with those in the waitlist control by [CONTACT_941] 4-month  assessment.  Further, those 
randomized to MySTYLE will have significantly greater levels of HIV prevention knowledge, 
more favorable attit udes toward HIV prevention, greater HIV preve ntion self-efficacy , and more 
effective family practices at  2- and [ADDRESS_235188] models, which will account for the three assessments being nested within individuals, and 
will help mitigate bias due to missing data.(100, 101) We will test for differences in linear change 
over time between groups on each outcome variable. For HIV testing outcome, we  will evaluate 
difference between conditions in the proportion of participants who engaged in HIV POC test. 
Propensity scores (i.e., inverse probability of treatment weighting) will be used to account for 
any imbalance in baseline characteristics between c onditions. (102)   Note that the research uses 
small block randomization based on age and sexual experience to reduce group imbalance. 
Intervention  acceptabil ity will be determined  at the 2-month  assessment using the Aim 2 criteria 
of mean scores ≥ 24 on the CSQ and ≥30 on the SEF . 
Power.  Although pi[INVESTIGATOR_197820] s are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_197821],(103) the 
RCT of 72 will nonetheless  provide a “signal” of impact regarding major outcom es – e.g. C SAs, 
HIV testing , parenting practices.   We conservatively assume that retention of 72 participants 
over 4 months is 85%, based on previous trials. Power analyses for kno wledge, attitudes , and 
family practices were run with Optimal Design 3.01(117) and assumed [ADDRESS_235189] size .41 SD for change in the scale score outcomes. If the alpha is 0.1 (as is appropriate 
in exploratory research) , then power is 0.[ADDRESS_235190] meaningful “signals” of impact. Power estimates for the behavioral counts were 
estimated using Mplus simulation utility using estimates from [CONTACT_46792]’s previous preventio n 
trials with adolescents. As expected, the study will be powered to detect medium to large effect 
sizes (rate -ratios/odds ratios ranging from 2.67 to 6.05).  These combined data (scale scores, 
behavior outcomes, acceptability) will be used to revise interv ention content and procedures, as  
indicated, and to prepare for a larger, definitive efficacy trial .

 Protection of Human Subjects and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
Please note:  In the Human Subjects section, we use the term parent  to refer to the legal 
guardian of the adolescent and caregiver  to refer to any family member or trusted, involved 
adult. Parent engagement in the RCT phase is desirable; however, caregiver engagement i s 
also acceptable to meet the needs of the intended intervention (MySTYLE).  
 
Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics and Design  
The program will be described in recruitment and advertisements as building  healthy 
adolescent relationships and acceptance of straight and gay adolescents.  Parents will be 
approached for consent after the teens have indicated an interest in the project, which will not 
reveal the adolescent’s sexual orientation or behavior, only an interest in participating .  
 
The proposed rese arch study is comprised of two phases, a formative phase to develop the 
intervention and a trial phase to test the intervention. In the formative phase  of the project 
(years 1 -2), the online family -based HIV prevention intervention will be adapted and refi ned to 
the needs of non -heterosexual Black adolescent males (nHBAM) and their parents/caregivers. 
Interviews will be conducted with approximately 15 non -heterosexual adolescent males, 15 
parents/caregivers and 15 stakeholders to inform development of the i ntervention. The 
investigators and our media partner, MEE Productions will iteratively refine digital material and 
ensure its relevance. Beta versions of the intervention, to be called MySTYLE, will be tested in 
an open trial to assess clarity, relevance a nd appeal of activities with approximately 10 non -
heterosexual Black adolescent males and their parents/caregivers.  
 
In the trial phase (year 3) a randomized control trial of MySTYLE will be conducted to compare 
to waitlist control condition  among 72 nHBA M and their parents/caregivers . The [ADDRESS_235191] protected site.  At the completion of the study, interested participants will 
be asked to partic ipate in a one -hour interview or focus group (in -person or via a video 
conferencing platform).  Youth and parent focus groups will be conducted separately.  
 
Inclusion Criteria . Eligibility criteria for adolescents  in all phases of the project will be : 
1) at least 13  years of age but no more than 20; 2) stably -housed (have resided with the same 
adult caregiver for the past [ADDRESS_235192] the city or caregiver in the next 6 
months). 3) the ability to read and speak English; 4) identify as a male; and 5) and identify 
racially as Black African American. Exclusion criteria will be: a) not able to provide meaningful 
assent as determined by [CONTACT_3647], b) known HIV -infection (staff will facilitate entry  into 
care if needed). Adolescents age [ADDRESS_235193] that the many of youth who participate will be  non-
heterosexual.  Eligibility criteria for Parents/caregivers  for all phases of the project will be: 1)  
parent/caregiver of an adolescent w ho is potentially eligible for enrollment into the study; and 2) 
English speaking. For the exit interview or focus group, in addition to the aforementioned 
criteria, participants  (youth and parents)  will have had to already completed the MySTYLE 
interventi on. 
 
Participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_197884] (My Brother ’s Keeper, GSA of Jackson, Mississippi [INVESTIGATOR_197799]), 
agencies / clinics (adolescent health, HIV and STI clinics, and schools (via referral from school 
health and guidance counselors). Recruiters will publicize the project to youth at agency 
Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235194] in 
recruitment. Currently enrolled participants will  be incentivized to recruit up to five new 
participants and will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_235195] sex with men.  
 
Sources of Material  
 
Research Material Obtained from Living Human Subjects  
Research material obtained from participants includes: 1) questionnaire data; 2) audio -tapes 
from individual or  group, interviews with nHBAM, parents/caregivers and stakeholders; and 3) 
Point -of-Care HIV test results. For the formative phase , participants (adolescents, 
parents/caregivers, stakeholders) will partake in interviews and will be asked questions 
regarding their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs relative to HIV prevention among nHBAM. 
Interviews will generate themes that participant s feel should be the focal points of MySTYLE. 
These interviews will take place in private offices controlled by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mena and located on the 
third floor of the Jackson Medical Mall. The audio -taped interview and written surveys of their 
reactions to possibl e intervention content will be the sources of material for this phase.  
 
During the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] , adolescents and parents/caregivers will complete the Session Evaluation 
Form and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire to assess the clarity, relevance, and appeal  of the 
activities and their reactions to the sessions. The adolescents in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_197822], HIV related knowledge/attitudes/beliefs, 
substance use, sexual behavior, self -efficacy for HIV  prevention, stigma, social support, 
parental involvement and parental -adolescent communication about sex. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_197823] [ADDRESS_235196] -enrollment.  
These assessments will occur in  a safe, convenient location at the Jackson Medical Mall or the 
Jackson Medical Tower.  
 
For the randomized  trial phase  of the intervention adolescents will complete questionnaires 
about their demographic information, HIV related knowledge/attitudes/beliefs , substance use, 
sexual behavior, self -efficacy for HIV prevention, stigma, social support, parental involvement 
and parent -adolescent communication about sex. Trial phase adolescent questionnaires will be 
completed in person  or remotely at entry to the st udy entry, 2- months, 4-, 6- and [ADDRESS_235197] control condition  who choose to participate in MySTYLE after their 4 -month 
assessment . At the completion of th e study, interested participants  will be asked to participate in 
a one -hour interview or focus group, either in -person or via a video conferencing platform.  Due 
to the COVID -19 outbreak, medical clinics and clinical spaces are limiting non -essential visits, 
which severely limits our abil ity to complete in -person study appointments. We are proposing to 
complete assessments  and exit interviews/focus groups  remotely using HIPAA -compliant 
electronic signature [CONTACT_197910]. This service would be available for the 
assessment s at study entry , at the 4 -month , and the exit interview/focus group . UMMC staff will 
be available via video conference for these assessments to complete enrollment and study 
completion activities. In -person assessments will occur in a safe, convenient loc ation at the 
Jackson Medical Mall , the Jackson Medical Tower . Remote assessments will occur in a location 
Version 10 1/6/202 1

 of the participant’s choosing . Participants will receive REDCap survey links via email. Once a 
survey has been completed, participants will receive an  online gift card. Biological measures 
(collected via POC HIV test) will be obtained at the in -person 4-month follow -up assessment  or 
participants may opt to receive a home HIV testing kit, which will be mailed to them by [CONTACT_197885] . 
Adolescents who agree to tak e a no -cost POC HIV test will be provided this based on standard -
of-care at the Crossroads Clinic. Positive test results will be reported to [CONTACT_197913] who will 
conduct confirmatory testing and follow -up using standard treatment and reporting protocols.    
 
Parents/caregivers in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_197824], parenting practices, parental monitoring, parent -teen 
communication about sex, acceptance of another’s non -heterosexual orientation, social support, 
and measures of acceptability. During th e trial phases, all assessments for parents/caregivers 
will occur online.  
 
Linkages to Subjects and Access to Subject Identities  
 
For each stage of the research study, participant names and contact [CONTACT_197886] a recruitment/enrollment  database. Once individuals enroll in the study, names 
will be linked to a participant ID number in this database, which will be kept in a restricted 
access folder on a secure server. All name/ID number files will be assigned a code name 
[CONTACT_197911] n ame of the study. Signed consent and assent forms will also be kept in a 
locked file cabinet, separate from any other project data. Once data collection is completed, the 
corresponding recruitment/enrollment database will be deleted as it is unnecessary to  maintain 
the link between participant identity and study data. Destruction of these databases must be 
witnessed and documented on the Master List Verification of Destruction document, which will 
be maintained in a regulatory file. Furthermore,  any informa tion collected as part of this study 
will be accessible only to research staff that has completed mandatory training in the protection 
of human subjects.  
 
Potential Risks  
 
The risks for this study are considered minimal. Every effort will be made to ensure  that study 
participants are protected from risks. The risks are as follows: 1) potential coercion; 2) loss of 
confidentiality; 3) emotional discomfort during the assessments and/or intervention activities; 4) 
risk associated with learning they have HIV, i f that is diagnosed during the course of the study; 
and 5) adverse reactions from parents/caregivers if participant discloses sexual attitudes or 
behavior (disclosure is not a study requirement). The protection against each risk is described in 
detail belo w under Adequacy of Protection Against Risk.  
 
Adequacy of Protection Against Risk  
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent.  The program will be described in recruitment and 
advertisements as building health and acceptance for Black young men of all backgrounds 
(sexual, economic, and family). Parents will be approached for consent after the teens have 
indicated an interest, whi ch will not reveal the adolescent’s sexual orientation or behavior, only 
that they are interested in greater health and acceptance of all teens and the tolerance of 
diversity. The project will use two experienced community recruiters with close ties to 
adolescent and LGBT relevant CBOs (My Brothers Keeper, GSA of Jackson, Mississippi [INVESTIGATOR_197799]), 
agencies / clinics (adolescent health, HIV and STI clinics, and schools (via referral from school 
health and guidance counselors). Recruiters will publicize the project  to youth at agency 
functions and with flyers/social media announcements. The agencies and schools will also 
Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235198] (formative phase , pi[INVESTIGATOR_197825]) will involve completing a preliminary eligibility screener and 
parents/caregivers of a potentially eligible youth will be approached for consent. Community 
recruiters will publicize the project to youth at agency functions and with flyers/soci al media 
announcements. The agencies and schools will also direct potentially at -risk youth to the 
project. We will also continue to utilize targeted advertisements posted on online social media 
platforms (e.g. SnapChat, Instagram, and/or Twitter) to recru it nHBAM.  Referrals and 
advertisements will provide the contact [CONTACT_197887], who will 
promptly initiate contact  [CONTACT_197888] . Recruitment of stak eholders (i.e. staff members at community -based 
organizations that serve LGBT youth, schools, faith -based organizations, and relevant state 
agencies) in the formative phase  of the study will involve being contact[CONTACT_197889] i nterviews. Exit adolescent /parent  interviews or focus group will be conducted with 
those that have already completed the intervention.  
 
The risk of possible coercion will be minimized by [CONTACT_197890] /consent  from non -heterosexual Black adolescent males.  In March 2020, the 
COVID -19 outbreak created significant barriers to recruiting  and enrolling participants in person. 
In situations where the COVID -19 outbreak has not affected recruitment and informed  consent,  
assent will be obtained using the same process applied to obtaining written informed consent in 
studies of adults (e.g., a research staff member will verbally explain the assent /consent  
document on a paragraph -by-paragraph basis). Study personne l will fully explain the study 
procedures, risks, benefits, and alternatives to adult participants and ask for their written 
informed consent. Participants will also be reminded that study participation is voluntary and 
that refusing to participate or with drawing from the study at any time will not result in any 
negative consequences.  
 
Formative phase  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_197826] : adolescents will be consented and 
enrolled with written parental consent. After hearing the description of the study a nd asking any 
questions they may have, adolescents who are interested in participating will be assented. 
Those interested will be asked to give our study team permission (and contact [CONTACT_3031]) to 
enroll their respective parents/caregivers to: 1) provide  written informed consent for those under 
18 and 2) to also participate in the project. The project will  not disclose the adolescent’s private 
behaviors or attitudes; and will not require adolescents to disclose any sexual behavior.   
 
Form ative phase  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_197827] : Parents will be contact[CONTACT_197891] a son’s participation obtained in person. If the parent 
(legal guardian) agrees to their son’s participation in the project but does not want to participate, 
the parent and adolescent can nominate “someone important in the life of the adolescent such 
as other family, teacher, religious leader, or social worker” who will be contact[CONTACT_197860]. 
Caregivers will not be enrolled in lieu of  a parent unless the parent agrees. This option of 
involving a caregiver, rather than a parent, worked well in Project STYLE, and involving a non -
parental adult was recently recommended as an intervention option for non -heterosexual 
adolescents.(69) Even if a parent/caregiver never participates in the intervention, MySTYLE , may

Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235199] enrollment : For the RCT phase  a waiver of parental consent will be utilized for those under 
[ADDRESS_235200] allows nHBAM  into the program before parent/caregiver involvement with a 
waiver of parental consent  for those under 18 and then prepares nHBAM  to safely involve 
their parent , if possible. nHBAM  aged 18 or older  will be able to provide their own consent, 
although we will ask for permission to enroll parents/caregivers , if possible and safe for the 
youth. The project will be described as a general sexual health intervention for adolescent 
males; it will not disclo se the adolescent’s private behaviors or attitudes and will not require 
adolescents to disclose any personal information.  Parent/Caregiver involvement may begin  
at study  entry or at mid -intervention, after  the nHBAM  has had more time to consider it.  
After the adolescent provides permission to contact [CONTACT_29382]/caregiver for enrollment, we will 
follow the parent/caregiver consent procedures described above in the formative  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_197828] s. Parents/ caregivers will be assigned to the same condition as their adolescents.   
 
RCT d igital consent , enrollment , and follow -up: In light of the COVID -19 outbreak, several of our 
recruitment sites (i.e. CBOs, clinics, and schools) have either closed or are limiting non -
essential visits. This limitation  severely impacts our ability to recruit and enroll potential 
participants in -person for the RCT phase of this project. We are proposing to offer digital 
consent and enrollment via HIPAA -compliant platforms (i.e. DocuSign , video conferencing 
software ). nHB AM identified as eligible, based on an online REDCap screener, will be asked if 
they would like to be contact[CONTACT_66696]. Those  that indicate they would like to be 
contact[CONTACT_197870], email address, and phone number. U MMC 
research assistants will follow up with interested parties by [CONTACT_61529]. Those who wish to 
participate will receive a DocuSign  consent form via email from the UMMC research assistant 
and will be given the opportunity to participate in a video conf erence call (via HIPAA -compliant 
video conferencing platform, such as Zoom) with the UMMC research assistant to review the 
consent form. The DocuSign  consent form will outline study aims and procedures and contains 
language regarding the risks/benefits of participating in a research study. The online survey 
data will be de -identified and kept in a password -protected participant log on a secure server. 
Participants will be given ample time to consider risks of participation and will have the 
opportunity to a sk questions during the video conference. Participants will also be reminded that 
study participation is voluntary and that refusing to participate or withdrawing from the study at 
any time will not result in any negative consequences. For the remaining fo llow-up appointments 
(at 2- and [ADDRESS_235201] control 
participants) participants will be emailed their online REDCap surveys and will receive online gift 
cards for each completed survey. At the [ADDRESS_235202] of 1996 and its regulations (“HIPAA”), and the DHHS Federal Policy f or the 
Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR Part 46 Subpart D). This will include identifying 
participant research data by [CONTACT_197893] -
identifying information separate from any research data. All resea rch data (written records and 
audiotapes of program sessions) will be kept in a locked file and electronic data will be 
Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235203] -protected. All of these study -related materials will only be accessible to research staff.  
No names, only identification codes , will be used in presenting data in lectures, seminars, and 
papers.  Information will be released only with written consent of the parent/guardian.  
 
Participant confidentiality will be breached only to protect the safety and welfare of research 
participan ts and only in accordance with state and federal law. If child abuse or neglect is 
reported, a report will immediately be filed with the appropriate state department or agency. See 
“Emotional Distress” below for more details on the available clinical servi ces.  
 
All  data collection (ie. Baseline, [ADDRESS_235204] 
phase for adolescents) will take place in secure and supervised settings , if possible . The 
REDCap  online survey software suite will be utilized for the collect ion of data from both 
participants through computer -assisted survey interviewing (CASI) as well as from relevant staff 
for project -specific data collection (e.g., recording/transferring of lab results, forms for rating and 
coding of intervention fidelity, site information),  from which data are easily extracted for entry to 
statistical programs (e.g., SPSS) . The research team will develop documentation for each 
survey measure, including appropriate branch and skip logic, as well as a codebook with 
documentation for each variable. Project managers will program surveys using the REDCap  
survey platform.  Basic survey content will be programmed first and then survey flow and logic 
will be programmed after content has been reviewed and edited. Survey -based reporting 
mechanisms will be programmed, including automated invitation and reminder emails for 
participants as well as triggered emails to staff for the purposes of monitoring and reporting. 
Usability testing by [CONTACT_197894], 
spelling, sequence, and comprehension. Further advanced testing will be condu cted in order to 
test the survey’s logic and flow; this advanced testing phase will include the generation of test 
data to ensure all branch and skip logic works as planned within the variable codebook. 
Throughout the course of the project, regular data do wnloads will be conducted to check the 
quality and accuracy of the data, to ensure no data are missing, and to regularly report on the 
sample characteristics.  REDCap  meets or exceeds all HIPAA and HITECH requirements for 
security and privacy .  Following d ata transfer, syntax will be developed to arrange the data for 
quantitative analysis. Directories describing data files, variable label codebooks, and data 
routines will be developed during the year -2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. Following that, data will be extracted and  
archived on a monthly basis. Routines for assessing data integrity will be developed, with 
procedures established for accepting, correcting, or rejecting data. All data will reside on servers 
behind firewalls (with access restricted to study personnel) an d on computers with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_197829]. All servers are routinely backed daily (to off -site locations), and the project will 
create its own weekly backups on secure external drives kept both on and off site. Transfer of 
data among the study sites wi ll be done using secure methods (e.g., secure FTP).  
 
All study personnel names on this application have completed training and received certification 
in Human Subjects Research Protection (CITI Program) and HIPAA regulations. They will 
continue to renew t his training in compliance with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13338].  
 
For the formative interviews in PY01  and exit interviews in PY03 , participants will be asked to 
provide informed written consent to audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_197830], whether they are 
participating in the individual or group interviews. To assure confidentiality and protection of the 
participants during audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], all tapes will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a secured 
office. Only research staff will have access to the audiota pes so that ongoing guidance can be 
provided as to the conduct and design of the study. . Notes taken by [CONTACT_197895] a study ID only and will be stored in a locked cabinet  in a locked room at the 
University of Mississippi [INVESTIGATOR_60584] . 
Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235205] protected devices and to complete study activities in a private, 
secure setting to minimize the risk of unintended disclosure.  
 
Emotional Distress.  We will minimize distre ss by [CONTACT_197896]/program techniques in 
a supportive manner, assuring participants that they may refuse to answer any questions that 
make them uncomfortable, and may terminate participation in the intervention at any time. All 
subjects may receive  medical or mental health treatment at any time during the study. Clinical 
need will determine whether it is appropriate for the participant to stop continuation in the study.  
 
Another potential risk associated with conducting research among non -heterosexu al Black 
adolescent males is unintentional disclosure of sexual desires/behaviors to family, friends and 
others. To minimize risks, we will enroll those who indicate interest a program to support 
healthy adolescent relationships and acceptance of adolescen ts of all backgrounds (e.g. 
sexual). Adolescents will not need to reveal their sexual behavior or attitudes to parents or to 
staff.  
 
Another potential risk is associated with adolescents learning that they have HIV. All participants, 
regardless of reporte d history of sexual activity, may accept free, confidential HIV testing at the final 
assessment. Before testing participants it will be explained that the testing process requires a 
blood test before we can give them their HIV test results. HIV screening w ill be done using a 
finger stick to obtain a specimen for the HIV rapid test (Clearview Complete HIV 1/2, Alere or 
Insti HIV -1/HIV -[ADDRESS_235206], Biolytical). For those unwilling to provide a fingerstick 
sample we will offer the test using an oral fluid sample (with OraQuick Advanced HIV -1/2 – 
OraSure Technologies, Inc). HIV testing will only be done by [CONTACT_197897], who will be 
certified in HIV testing and counseling procedures. If the rapid test results are inconclusive, 
invalid, or p reliminary positive, when that happens, instead of receiving their results in few 
minutes, they may have to wait [ADDRESS_235207] positive for HIV; however, those who test positive 
may feel extreme distress when learning of their diagnosis. For those who test positive to HIV, 
they will be counse led in private by [CONTACT_197898]’s HIV testing and counseling 
guidelines. The diagnosis and counseling provided will involve first r eviewing the type of test that 
was administered to the youth, giving them their test results, explain the meaning of  the test result, 
ask the youth if they have any questions, comments or concerns, talk about resources, discuss 
the adolescent’s feelings and assess their readiness to leave the location, secure additional 
support and resources for the youth if necessary, and provide them with additional information if 
necessary. All youth will be taken to the University of Mississippi [INVESTIGATOR_197831]. If an 
appointment in  the HIV clinic is not immediately available, then study staff will maintain contact 
[CONTACT_197899].  The result will be reported to the 
Department of Health as per state regulations.  [CONTACT_197913] and staff ar e expert HIV medical care 
providers and are experienced in assisting those newly diagnosed with HIV.  
Minors may obtain STI treatment without consent of parents; accordingly,  parents will not be 
notified of results. Our study staff cannot request identifyin g information about sex partners. 
Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235208] (i.e. consenting, baseline assessment, 
interview session, follow -up, collection of biological data), clinical resources will be offered on -
site. The clinical location used in this study is i deal as it provides easy access to medical and 
mental health clinicians. If a participant contacts study staff because of distress or concern due 
to participation in the study or directed activities that occur away from the clinical space  (such 
as a conce rn that phone use or activities led to a dispute with parents), he will be assessed first 
over the phone, and then, if needed, as described below.  
 
During any phase of the study, if research staff determines that a participant is an acute medical 
or psych iatric risk, [CONTACT_197913] or a licensed designee will meet with him individually for further 
assessment and notify the participants’ parents of any clinical needs. Acute risks would include 
severe medical illness, or the development of any other severe psychia tric symptoms or 
disclosure of sexual or physical abuse. Any adolescent who exhibits acute risks will be 
evaluated immediately by [CONTACT_197900], by [CONTACT_197901]. Less severe medical needs or distress ca n be managed by [CONTACT_197902]. Mena 
over the phone or with an individual interview. [CONTACT_197913] and/or staff will meet with participants 
and/or families to review concerns and to make referrals for continuing care as needed. Of note, 
members of the proposed res earch team have substantial prior clinical (medical and psychiatric) 
and research experience in care of adolescent males as evidenced through their biographical 
sketches.  
 
One final protection involves the disclosure by [CONTACT_197903] [ADDRESS_235209] 36 months older than the minor. 
Mississippi’s law requires immediate reporting of these cases  to the Mississippi [INVESTIGATOR_197832] (MDHS). [CONTACT_197913] has created a protocol that will be applied to this 
circumstance, should it arise. It is important to note that our assessment instruments do not ask 
study participants about the age of thei r sex partners. However, we do clearly recognize the 
possibility that young male study participants may volunteer such information to the study staff 
during interviews or in the course of the assessments. In brief, clinic policy requires that the 
person to  whom the information was disclosed should immediately report to MDHS Child 
Protective Services the incident by [CONTACT_197904] (1 -[PHONE_4273]). The 
report is then screened by a MDHS supervisor to decide whether it should be invest igated. 
Thus, if a minor in our study discloses having sex with an adult (at least 36 months older than 
the minor) this mandatory reporting protocol is activated. Any male study participant ages 17 
and under will be told that the health department is oblig ated to report to the state any instance 
of sex with older men (if at least 24 months older than the minor for those 14 and under and 36 
months older than the minor  for youth ages 15 -17). [CONTACT_197913] employs three full -time case 
managers who are trained couns elors and will be on -hand to handle instances  where a 15 -17 
year old discloses sex with an adult to a member of the research staff. The case managers 
provide additional evaluation to assure the welfare of the minor.  
 
Adverse Reactions from Parent/caregiver s. The project will be described as an intervention 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_197833] ; it will not disclose the adolescent’s private behaviors or attitudes; and will not 
Version 10 1/6/202 1 
30 
 require adolescen ts to disclose any sexual behavior.  However, it is possible that some 
parents/caregivers will discover their son is non -heterosexual during the course of the study. 
Many of the enrolled nHBAM will have previously disclosed their non -heterosexual identity to 
parents/caregivers thus we are primarily concerned here with those who have not done so in the 
past.    Adverse reactions from this discovery may include verbal or physical threats or abuse, or 
various forms of physical neglect (asking the adolescent to  move out) and abuse. Our plan is 
twofold: 1) avert disclosures that may be dangerous in any way, and 2) mitigate harm when 
signs of retribution first occur. To avert potentially risky disclosures we will guide non -
heterosexual Black adolescent males throu gh the completion of a Self-Safety Evaluation tool  
that we will create. This tool serves as a “best possible” method of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_55765] -heterosexual 
Black adolescent males make the decisions regarding what personal information to discuss with 
their parents, su ch as expressing their non -heterosexual identity. The tool helps participants 
anticipate likely reactions, based on past history, and identify trusted available social supports 
and safety resources, including project staff. Staff will be available to revie w the results of the 
Self-Safety Evaluation with the participant  if needed  and will follow -up with the participant if any 
adverse reactions are reported . If research staff learns of any verbal, emotional or physical 
abuse from a parent, he/she will immedia tely notify [CONTACT_197913] who, in turn, will exercise any of 
several options: 1) initiate mandatory reporting as required by [CONTACT_76522], 2) notify local child 
protective service authorities regarding the situation, or 3) withdraw the adolescent from the 
study as  a safety precaution.   
 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others  
 
Importance of Knowledge to be Gained.  All phases of the proposed study will provide 
important information for the development of HIV prevention interventions for non-heterosexual 
Black adolescent males . We hope that our intervention will be successful in reducing HIV risk 
behavior among non-heterosexual Black adolescent males  and think that the clear examination 
of these questions outweighs the previously mentioned risks. The effectiveness of a tailored, 
scalable, online HIV prevention intervention is severely understudied with this population . Given 
the significant risk of HIV infection among nHBAM and the lack of easily accessible prevention 
interventions tailored specifically to nHBAM, the knowledge to be gained from this research is 
significant. The risks to participants are reasonable in r elation to the importance of the 
knowledge to be gained.  
 
Reimbursement for Time and Effort. Participants (approximately 15 non-heterosexual Black 
adolescent males , 15 parents/caregivers) will be reimbursed $30 for focus group participation. 
Stakeholders w ill be reimbursed $[ADDRESS_235210] 
members (4 non-heterosexual Black adolescent males , 4 parents/caregivers, 4 community 
members) will be reimbursed approximately $50 for each meeting (12 CAB members x $50 x 4 
meetings/year in Years 1 -3). Participants in the Open Trial (10 nHBAM and their 
parents/caregivers) will be reimbursed $[ADDRESS_235211] -intervention 
assessments. Randomized Controlled Trial participants (72 nHBAM) will be reimbursed 
appro ximately $35 for the in -person assessments ( baseline, 2-month s, 4-months, [ADDRESS_235212]-intervention).  Only those assigned to the waitlist control condition will be eligible 
for the 6 - and 8 - month assessments.  Randomized Controlled Trial pare nts/caregivers will be 
reimbursed $ 35 for each of the online assessments ( baseline, 2-months,  4-months, [ADDRESS_235213] -intervention).  Only those assigned to the waitlist control will be eligible to 
complete the 6 - and 8 -month assessments.   All online assessments will culminate in a screen 
that provides study participants with a code for an online purchase from Amazon.com. Currently 
enrolled participants will be incentivized to recruit up to five new participants and will receive an 
Version 10 1/6/202 1 
31 
 additional $10 for each referral that is enrolled in the study (up to a total of $50).  Exit interview 
or focus group participants will be reimbursed $100 for the one -hour interview/focus group.  
 
 
Inclusion of Children, Women and Minorities  
 
Children. In this family -based intervention approximately half of the participants will be youth 
ages [ADDRESS_235214] involves a family -based intervention, which provides the opportunity to include 
parents/caregivers who may be women. It is anticipated that approximately 80% of the sample 
of parents/caregivers and stakeholders will b e females.  
 
Minorities.   The aim of our recruitment strategy is for the resulting program materials to be 
appropriate for Black non -heterosexual males because of their high risk for acquiring HIV. In 
terms of race, 100% of the enrolled adolescent participa nts will be Black/African American. 
Ethnically, 5% or fewer will self -identify as Hispanic or Latino.  
 
 
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (DHHS) “REQUIRED EDUCATION IN 
THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS”  
Since October 1, 2001, Lifespan has required that researchers and IRB members read 
Protecting Study Volunteers in Research  (Dunn & Chadwick) and complete the related exam. 
This process has served as initial certification between 10/2001 and 5/2005. In June  2005, the 
Office of Research Administration contracted with CITI, a Collaborative Institutional (modular) 
Training Initiative program, for our Human Subjects protection and HIPAA training for all 
research personnel.  Currently this program offers our rese archers a basic human subject's 
protection course as well as a refresher course, which is required every three years. 
Documentation of successful completion is automatically generated and is printed directly by [CONTACT_101491]. For further information regar ding Lifespan’s Human Subject’s Protection course go 
to: http://www.lifespan.org/research/IRB/MandatoryEdguidance.asp. Additional and continuing 
education opportunities for clinical researchers include the Office of Research Administration 
newsletter that is circulated to > 900 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_137362] 6 weeks. Relevant information concerning 
research review is available on the ORA web page at www2.lifespan.org/research/ . In addition 
to standard institutional research information, the web page contains links to oth er sites such as 
CenterWatch, NIH, PRIM&R/ARENA.  Investigators and staff at all sites receive similar training 
and certification.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
The nature of the population warrants the development of a Data Safety and Monitoring Plan.  
To address the NIH policy for Data and Safety Monitoring, Drs. Brown and Crosby [CONTACT_197905] a system for oversight of the proposed study and its participants. The Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan for this application will begin by [CONTACT_197906]-to-day monitoring of the study.  Weekly meetings with the research team will be conducted 
Version 10 1/6/[ADDRESS_235215] will designate two Independent Safety Monitors  (one in Jackson, MS 
and one in Rhode Island) wi ll review all Adverse events with the PIs quarterly or more frequently 
as indicated. The Independent Study Monitors will be academic researchers with experience in 
psychosocial intervention trials with adolescents.  
 
Reporting adverse events:  
1. Serious Ad verse Events:  The PIs will immediately report any serious adverse events 
(SAEs) to the UMMC IRB and the Rhode Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_197834] 24 hours of our receipt of information regarding the event; SAEs will a lso be 
reported in writing to NIH. Actions taken by [CONTACT_197907], as will reports of changes or amendments to the protocol as a result of an SAE. Reports of 
changes or amendments to the protocol in general must b e requested first in writing to the 
Lifespan IRB, which then will grant or deny permission to make the requested change or 
amendment in protocol. Modifications to study aims or design will also be submitted to NIH for 
approval prior to instituting them. Fi nally, if significant medical or mental health risks occur 
during the study period evaluation by [CONTACT_779]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_197835]. In the event 
that a resea rch participant either withdraws from the study or the investigator decides to 
discontinue a research participant due to SAE, the research participant will be monitored by [CONTACT_197908] a resolution is reached (i.e. the problem 
requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_75209]), the SAE 
is determined to be clearly unrelated to the study intervention, or the SAE results in death. 
Outcome of all SAEs will be periodically reporte d to NIMH. A summary of the SAEs that 
occurred during the previous year will be included in the annual progress report to NIMH.  
2. Any moderate adverse event (e.g., causing interference with usual activities or 
requiring treatment) and which appears defin itely, probably, or possibly related to study 
participation will be reported to the IRB as indicated under #1 above in writing within 20 working 
days.  
3. Any mild adverse event will be summarized in the NIMH and IRB annual progress 
reports and will be rev iewed by [CONTACT_197909].  
We will inform the NIMH of actions, if any, taken by [CONTACT_1026], or changes in our 
protocols as result of any of the reviews.

68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 7 of 201 Introduction
1.1 Overview
Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.  We aim to 
image patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer using Gallium-68 labeled HBED-CC 
PSMA (more commonly called 68Ga-PSMA-11) in order to demonstrate its utility.   We plan to 
utilize this data to obtain further approvals of the 68Ga-PSMA-[ADDRESS_42310] commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer 
death in American men (1).   Existing conventional imaging (CT, MRI and bone scans) has a 
low sensitivity in detecting local recurrence or metastatic disease (2).  The one exception being 
NaF PET/CT for the detection of osseous metastasis.  Due to this limitation, numerous 
approaches to stage patients have been evaluated.
Choline imaging has been frequently used, as prostate cancer exhibits increase choline uptake 
that has been associated with the presence of choline kinase (3).  Choline uptake is increased 
in comparison to FDG in both androgen dependent and independent prostate cancer patients 
(4).  Choline has also been shown to be sensitive for the detection of recurrent tumor in patients 
with PSA (prostate specific antigen) values of less than 1.0 ng/ml (5).  There are two forms of 
choline that are used in imaging prostate cancer, C-[ADDRESS_42311] better detection rates for distant metastatic disease (6).  C-11 choline has limited 
sensitivity for osseous metastasis, possibly due to the decreased uptake time (7).  Additionally, 
the sensitivity of C-11 choline is limited in patients with PSA values < 1.0 ng/ml (8-10).  Although 
choline PET may be limited in sensitivity, it clearly delineates more lesions than cross section 
imaging or bone scan in patients with known disease (11).   In 2012, the Mayo Clinic obtained 
NDA (new drug application) approval from the FDA for the use of C-11 choline.  
A separate approach is to image the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA).  PSMA is 
expressed on the majority of prostate cancer cells, and so would be an ideal cell membrane 
protein to image.  The initial imaging approach to PSMA imaging target the intracellular domain 
using Indium-111-capromab (Prostascint), a murine monoclonal antibody (12,13).  Although 
there was early promise for the detection of nodal metastasis (14), the agent was never able to 
adequately visualize osseous metastasis (15).  Although combination with SPECT/CT does 
Version date: 26NOV2019 Protocol CC#:185513 
68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 8 of 20improve lesion detection (16).  One main limitation to In-111-capromab is that it takes a 
prolonged time to localize to the target tissue, which likely relates to both the size of the 
monoclonal antibody and the fact that agent targets the intracellular domain of the PSMA 
protein. Additionally, Prostascint also recognizes an intracellular epi[INVESTIGATOR_40601]. This likely only occurs in permeable dead or dying tumor 
cells. 
Because of the limitations of In-[ADDRESS_42312] demonstrates that PSMA-11 has a higher sensitivity for the detection 
of disease than F-18 choline in a head-to-head intra-patient comparison that included 37 
patients (17).  The second paper looked at the sensitivity of PSMA-11 in the detection of 
metastatic lesions in patients with recurrent prostate cancer (18).  Their results demonstrated a 
detection rate of 50% for patients with a PSA less than 1 ng/ml, and detection rate above 85% 
for patients with a PSA greater than 2 ng/ml.  These detection rates are significantly higher than 
that reported by [CONTACT_40605] (5).
Because of the improved resolution and image quality with PET, ability to quantitate uptake, 
increased sensitivity compared to choline, we intend to evaluate the utility of Ga-[ADDRESS_42313] completed numerous trials evaluating 68Ga-PSMA-11 at UCSF and in conjuction with 
other institutions.  These studies are currently being developed into an NDA application for 
submission to the FDA.

4.1 Description, Supply and Storage of Investigational Drugs
4.1.1 Investigational Drug #1
Ga-68 labeled PSMA-11 (or PSMA-HBED-CC) is a radiopharmaceutical that will be produced 
under cGMP.
5 Treatment Plan
5.1 Dosage and Administration
The imaging agent (Ga-68 PSMA-11 or PSMA-HBED-CC) will be administered on an outpatient 
basis.  It will be administered a single time intravenously prior to the PET imaging.  The injected 
dose will be 3 to 7 mCi  10% of 68Ga-PSMA-11.
5.1.1 Other Modality(ies) or Procedures
[IP_ADDRESS] PET imaging
a)68Ga-PSMA-11 PET preparation and injection:
The intravenously injected dose will be 111-259 MBq (3-7 mCi  10%) of 68Ga-PSMA-11
PET.  A dose of 20 mg of furosemide (Lasix) is recommended to be injected i.v. together
with, shortly before or after administration of the radiotracer in order to minimize PET
scatter artifacts from excreted radiotracer accumulation in the kidney and urinary bladder
that can occur with the gallium-68 radionuclide.  Oral hydration is recommended on the
day of the scan. Voiding is recommended immediately before start of the scan.
Furosemide should not be administered in patients with medical contraindications to
Furosemide administration including allergies and adverse reactions including sulfa
allergies.  (Note: Application of Furosemide can be omitted as part of the PET imaging
protocol if a second-generation scatter correction algorithm is available for the PET
scanner used in this protocol).    PET imaging will begin 50-100 minutes after injection,
but may be possible in certain circumstances for imaging to be delayed due to patient
workflow or equipment issues.  Scan time per bed position will be determined based on
each sites PET scanner capabilities.
b) Patient preparation: no fasting is required.
c) PET protocol: Scan coverage will extend from mid thigh to the base of the skull, starting
from the mid-thighs to prevent urinary bladder radiotracer accumulation at the start of
PET imaging.  Bed position scan time will be dependent on each sites scanner
capabilities.  At a minimum, 3 minutes per bed position will be used.  In certain

There are no prohibited medications.
7 Reporting and Documentation of Results
7.1 Evaluation of Side Effects
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions
Evaluable for toxicity
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of 68Ga-PSMA-11.
7.2 Evaluation of Safety
Analyses will be performed for all patients receiving 68Ga-PSMA-11.  The study will use the 
CTCAE v4.0 for reporting of adverse events.
7.3 Definitions of Adverse Events
7.3.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (also known as an adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug 
related.  More specifically, an adverse event (can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug, without any judgment about causality.  An adverse event can arise from any use of the 
drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
7.3.2 Adverse Reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_2224] a drug.  Adverse 
reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude 
that the drug caused the event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected 
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” indicates that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.
Version date: 26NOV2019 Protocol CC#:185513 
68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 13 of [IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or package insert(s), or is not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observed, or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or 
as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.
Adverse events that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process are 
considered unexpected for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the 
investigator brochure.  For example, a certain number of non-acute deaths in a cancer trial 
would be anticipated as an outcome of the underlying disease, but such deaths would generally 
not be listed as a suspected adverse reaction in the investigator brochure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
Death
Life-threatening adverse event
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct
normal life function
Congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.
[IP_ADDRESS] Life-threatening
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered life-threatening if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Version date: 26NOV2019 Protocol CC#:185513 
68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 14 of 207.4 Recording of an Adverse Event
All grade 3 and above adverse events will be recorded using the NCI CTCAE v4.0.   The 
Investigator will assign attribution of the possible association of the event with use of the 
investigational drug.

Signs or symptoms reported as adverse events will be graded and recorded by [CONTACT_40607].  When specific adverse events are not listed in the CTCAE they will be 
graded by [CONTACT_40608], mild , moderate or severe according to the following grades 
and definitions:
Grade 0 No AE (or within normal limits)
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention (e.g., packing, cautery) 
indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening;

Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration
If the study is being conducted under an IND, the Sponsor-Investigator is responsible for 
determining whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for expedited 
reporting in accordance with Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.32). 
The Investigator must report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction that is both 
serious and unexpected.  The Sponsor-Investigator needs to ensure that the event meets all 
three definitions: 
Suspected adverse reaction (as defined in 6.1.30)
Unexpected (as defined in 0)
Serious (as defined in 6.1.5)
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an 
expedited IND safety report.
The timeline for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days after 
the Investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)). 
Any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA no 
later than 7 calendar days  after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(2)). 
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report will 
be submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the 
information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)).

ST-[ADDRESS_1283546]
y eye disease (DE D) is a prevalent chronic eye condition affecting between 5% and 34% of 
the population worldwide. More than 16 million Americans suffer from DED, including 
approximately 1 million to 4 mil lion between 65 to 84 years of age (Fiscella 2011,          
Messmer 2015). F urthermore, th e age of onset is decreasing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_913407] “screen time” such that teenagers are now more frequently showing signs 
and symptoms of DED. S ymptoms include severe ocu lar burning, discomfort, pain, and in more 
severe cases compromised visual function, including symptomatic blurred vision. T hese 
symptoms are associated with tear film hyperosmolarity and instability, inflammation, and 
wounding of the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_913408] (Bowman’s layer) that is part of 
the extracellular matrix (ECM) and to which t he epi[INVESTIGATOR_913409]. As is now 
recognized, even the early stages of DED tissue damage  penetrates well beyond the surface 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_913410], i ncluding disruption of the collagen that is contained in 
Bowman’s layer and the underlying corneal stroma (Shetty, Deshpande et al. 2016 ).  
Epi
[INVESTIGATOR_913411], most 
notably IL- 6, IL -8 and m atrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In the eye, MMP -9 partially digests 
collagen via its collagenase activity leading to structural and functional disruptions in the 
collagen matrix underlying t he corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] (Baratta et.al. , in press ). Topi[INVESTIGATOR_900]-
inf
lammator y therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., Restasis®, Xiidra®, Cequa™) have been used to interrupt this 
process, but they act extremely slowly. F ull restoration of corneal homeostasis requires a fully 
regenerated surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] , which f irst requires the repair of the  collagen substrate. Such 
repaired collagen then shows the tightly structured and organized fibrillar pattern characteristic 
of native type I collagen, leading to a resumption of the functional activities of collagen in 
modulating structural integrity of the ocular ECM and in mediating certain signal transduction 
activities. This restoration of collagen and ECM homeostasis in turn promotes the rapid 
regeneration of the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] (see, e.g., Kivanany et al., 2018; Hapach et al., 2015).  
Dis
ruptions in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_913412] , which comprises several collagen types, are 
also a critical part of ocular surface pathology. Disruption in the basement membrane collagen 
network l eads to adverse effects on the integrity of Bowman’s membrane and allows 
inflammatory cytokines to pass through, increasing inflammatory cell infiltration in the area of 
the wound ( Shetty, Deshpande et al. 2016). In addi tion to the se anatomical a nd physiological 
changes, certain changes in cellular signaling a ctivities occur as well. This is both a hallmark and 
a cause of DED (see, e.g., Baratta et al. (2021, in press)).  
No 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_913413]- mediated damage to the collagen-
containing ocular surface tissue that is associated with DED. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_913414] (e.g., amniotic membrane implants, soft contact 
[CONTACT_13276], and topi[INVESTIGATOR_900]- inflammatories such as those described above) but these indirect topi[INVESTIGATOR_913415] -inflammatories only allow the body to heal collagen secondarily, slowly and 
quite unpredictably. Thus, there remains an urgent and unmet medical need for a dir ect, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_913416] a hallmark of DED. 
ST-100, a formulation comprising a synthetic collagen mimetic peptide, is being developed to 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_913417].  Stuart Therapeutics  
ST-[ADDRESS_1283547] common prescription therapeutics for DED are topi[INVESTIGATOR_900]-inflammator ies 
such as Xiidra®, Restasis® and Cequa™. These traditional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], however, do not directly 
treat a major underlying cause and effect of DED – damage to the ocular surface tissue and 
specifically to the collagen in the ECM within and underlying the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. The 
Sponsor has therefore sought to identify and evaluate potential therapeutic  formulations which 
directly repair ocular surface tissue damage which would provide a more rapid and enduring 
relief of symptoms  compared to traditional therapeutic approaches. To date such a therapeutic 
has not been available. ST-[ADDRESS_1283548]-100 to the wounded eyes of 
mice was shown to induce significant recovery of the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], stromal matrix and 
Bowman’s lay er following lamellar keratectomy  compared  to phosphate- buffer ed saline negative 
controls. Together with corresponding data obtained using in vitro  models of the corneal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], these results encouraged the Sponsor to examine the potential for use of ST-[ADDRESS_1283549]-100 Ophthalmic

STUDY DURATION 
An i
ndividual subjec t’s part icipation will involve 7 visits over approximately a 35-days period (7 
days pre- screening, 28 days of treatment). 
MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
During the course of the study an O ra monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to 
review protocol compliance, assess I P accountability, and ensure the study is being conducted 
according to the pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of the subjects’ medical records 
will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject confidentiality. Further details 
of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan. 
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, qu ality assurance and or its designees 
may carry out on- site inspections and/or audits which may include source data checks. 
Therefore, direct access to the original source data will be required for inspections and/or audits. 
All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as 
subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws apply.  
 ADVERSE EVENTS  
ADVERSE EVENT (A E) 
An AE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP in 
humans, whether or not considered IP-related. An AE  can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an IP , without any judgment about causality. An AE  can arise from any use of the IP (e.g., 
off-label use, use in combination with another drug or medical device) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, 
implantation, or use of a medical device, including medical device failure, subject characteristics 
that may impact medical device performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic 
parameters (e.g., energy applied, sizing, dose release, and anatomic fit ) associated with medical 
device use . 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from study 
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other diagnostic procedures will 
be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate pages of the case report form ( CRF ). 
Any clinically relevant deterioration in clinical find ing is considered an AE and must be 
recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should 
be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE  should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, and relationship to IP , action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078]. 
Exacerbation of conditions related to the signs and symptoms of DE D will not be  reported as an 
AE. Stuart Therapeutics  
ST-100 Ophthalmic SolutionProtocol 
IND 143015

9.1.1 Severity  
S
everity of an AE  is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as 
determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of severity 
is made irrespective of relationsh ip to IP  or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated 
according to the following scale:  
• Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere with 
the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe:  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, and 
interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1283575] use information about the conditions/concurrent medication, 
and chronology of the event relative to drug. The  investigator should initially classify the 
relatedness of an AE, but the final classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s 
determination unless revised by [CONTACT_1034], which has the ultimate responsibility for judging 
relatedness.  The relationship of  each AE to the IP  should be determined by [CONTACT_80694]:  
• Definitely Related : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from  
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug class, is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_913420]. 
• Probably Related : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from  
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug class, is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_913421].  
• Possibly Related : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from  
the time of IP administration, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_281694]’s clinical  
state or by [CONTACT_339413].  
• Unlikely to be Related : Relationship uncertain to the investigational product.  Likely to 
be related to factors other than investigational product but cannot be ruled out with 
certainty.  
• Not Related : Concurrent illness, concurrent medication, or other known cause is clearly 
responsible for the AE, the administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time, or exposure to IP has not occurred.

9.1.3 Expectedness 
Th
e expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information about 
the IP  using these explanations: 
• Unexpected : An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
• Expected : An AE that is listed in the Investigational Brochure ( IB) at the specificity and 
severity that has been observed.  
• Not applicable : An AE unrelated to the IP. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological/mechanical (or other) properties of the product but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation are to be considered 
unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classif y the expectedness of an AE , but the final classification is 
subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination.  
 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
An
 AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcom es: 
• Death;  
• Is life-threatening; 
Note: An AE  is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include 
an AE  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
Note: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if less 
than 24 hours), unless the inpatient admission was pre- plann ed prior to the signing of the 
informed consent. For chronic or long- term inpatients, inpatient admission includes 
transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same -day/ambulatory 
procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; 
nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units.  
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241526]. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;  
Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve) .

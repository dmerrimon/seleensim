BTBS.CR.SP.009.11v1   MaxAn® Cervical Post Market Surveillance  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_527902] Market Surveillance Validation is to document the performance 
and clinical outcomes of the MaxAn® Anterior Cervical Plate System .  [CONTACT_77108], et.al 
conducted a retrospective review and found a positive association between adjacent -
level ossification following anterior cervical plate procedures and the plate- to-disc 
distance. [ADDRESS_527903] from the adjacent disc spaces, there was a decrease in the likelihood of 
moderate- to-severe adjacent -level ossification.  The design of the MaxAn Anterior 
Cervica l Plate and accompanying technique allows this type of plate placement; therefore 
we will be looking at the radiographic outcomes of these subjects and comparing them to 
the retrospective chart review conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Park .  Using the MaxAn Technique 
allow s you to achieve plate placement of 5mm from the supraadjacent level which will 
help minimize the risk of adjacent level ossification.  
[ADDRESS_527904] DESCRIPTION  
Device Name : [CONTACT_418530]® Anterior Cervical Plate System  
 The MaxAn
® Anterior Cervical Plate System provides a simple, efficient and innovative 
approach to anterior cervical plating.  The system offers a decompression- based 
technique for cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_418495]- level plate 
technique that provides a direct relationship between the bone graft/spacer size and the position of the plate holes.  The unique ability to obtain maximum screw angulation and 
place a fixed screw at any angle up to  30° cephalad on the superior end of the plate and 
up to 30°caudal on the inferior end of the plate allows for versatile screw placement close 
to the endplates.  Note that the screws converge at 10° in the transverse plane and are 
not intended to have additional variability in that plane.  The significant cephalad- caudal 
angulation affords  the surgeon the opportunity to choose a smaller plate to help minimize 
the potential for adjacent level ossification.  
 The p late is low profile and allows for excellent intra- operative visualization of the 
vertebral end plate and graft.  The system also provides  a choice of fixed and variable 
self-drilling screws to provide the surgeon with multiple options.

20-Jun-2011  The MaxAn® Anterior Cervical Plate System is a n anterior cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_418496] (Ti -6Al-4VELI).  Pre -contoured plates that conform to the natur al 
lordotic curvature of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_418497], two, or three level configurations.  
These offerings also range from 8.0mm to 72mm in length when measured from screw 
hole to screw hole.  The system includes variable and fixed bone screws, which are 
available in 4.0mm and 4.5mm diameters in various lengths .  The MaxAn® Anterior  
Cervical Plate System is cleared under K080646.  
 
Indication s For Use:  The MaxAn® Anterior Cervical Plate System is intended for anterior 
interbody screw fixation of the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The system is indicated for use in the 
temporary stabilization of the anterior spi[INVESTIGATOR_418498] (as defined by [CONTACT_418507]), trauma ( including fractures ), 
tumors, deformity (defined as 'kyphosis, lordosis, or scoliosis),  pseudarthrosis , and/or 
failed previous fusions. The intended levels for treatment range from C2 - T1. 
Contraindications for Use :  The MaxAn® Anterior Cervical Plate System  is 
contraindicat ed in patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_418499];  morbid obesity ; mental 
illness, alcoholism or drug abuse;  pregnancy ; metal sensi tivity/foreign body sensitivity;  
inadequate tissue coverage over the operative site, open wounds local to the operative 
area, or rapid joint disease, bone absorption, osteopenia and/or osteoporosis.  
Osteoporosis is a relative contraindication since the condition may limit the degree of 
obtai nable correction,  the amount of mechanical fixation and/or intolerance.  
 
[ADDRESS_527905] market surveillance study will enroll up to two hundred (200) subjects at up to 
[ADDRESS_527906] -

scoring statement is recorded as a true indication of his disability.  If a section is not 
completed because it is inapplicable, the final score is adjusted to obtain a percentage.   
Neck and Shoulder/Arm Pain :  Preoperatively all subjects will asses s their neck  and/or 
radicular shoulder/Arm pain in one or both arms  using a visual analogue scale (VAS) 
from 0- [ADDRESS_527912] painful.  
SF-36v2™ Health Survey :  Preoperatively all subjects will complete a SF -36v2™ Health 
Survey as an outcome measure to assess quality of life.  
4.2 Perioperative and Postoperative Management  
The Surgeon will perform a 1 to 3 level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion per their 
usual technique.  Patient positioning and exposure will be performed by [CONTACT_418508] .  The surgeon will also take care t o perform 
the discectomy(ies) and endplate preparation(s) to their liking and will insert the graft(s) 
of their choosing per their preferred insertion method.  On label indications include use of: 
machined allograft spacers, with or without bone graft extenders or interbody fusion 
devices with autogenous bone, with or without bone graft extenders.  This study protocol 
stipulates that screw hole placement will be specific to the MaxAn Anterior Cervical Plate 
System technique in which screw holes are placed w ithin 1.5mm of the cephalad treated 
endplate.  This helps to enable the hardware to be greater than 5mm from the supradjacent level.  Screw hole placement and preparation will be done via one of the 
following methods for this study:  
1. Using the MaxAn Syst em Trial Drill Guide which pre -drills screw holes 1.5mm 
above and below the endplates in a one level construct and drills the cephalad 
holes 1.5mm above the endplate in a two or three level construct  
2. Using the MaxAn System Endplate Drill Guide which pre- drills the cephalad 
screw holes 1.5mm above the endplate in a two or three level construct  
 
BTBS.CR.SP.009.11v1   MaxAn® Cervical Post Market Surveillance  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_527913] the screw holes within 1.5mm of the cephalad 
endplate  
4. Using no MaxAn drill guide while "free handing" the screws into the plate, 
requiring the surgeon to take care to place the holes within 1.5mm of the cephalad treated endplate  
5. Using no MaxAn drill guide while placing the Punch Awl, requiring the surgeon 
take care to place the punch awl pi[INVESTIGATOR_418502] 1.5mm of the cephalad treated 
endplate  
Screws will be locked and tightened per the MaxAn System ring locking mechanism and 
closure will be performed per the surgeon's normal preference in an ACDF.  Data will be  
collected during and immediately after the surgery according to the parameters described 
by [CONTACT_418509]
® Anterior Cervical Plate CRFs.  This includes: duration of surgery, blood 
loss, OR time, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], instrumentation used, type of procedure, surgical 
level, biological augmentation, type of implants and any interbody fixation system used (if 
applicable) . In addition, all intra- operative complications (e.g. excessive blood loss, 
hematoma, vascular injury, etc.) will be reported and recorded as  a complication on the 
CRF.  
Intra-operative (after hardware is completed) or immediate post -operative x -rays need to 
be obtained at this time point.  These images will be provided to Biomet to review along 
with the data collected from the surgical visit.  We will be assessing the position of the 
plate at this time point at both the plate level and the distance to the adjacent level.  Postoperative care will follow the standard of care at each institution for  subject s who 
undergo anterior cervical fusion procedures.  
4.3 Follow -up Assessment  
Subjects will be asked to return postoperatively at 6  (± 2weeks) , 12 (± 1 month) and 24 (± 
1 month)  months for a clinical and radiographic exam.   Data collected during this exam 
will include:  
• Clinical assessment: The investi gator will carry out a clinical examination at the 6, 
12 and 24 month visit to assess:  
• subject  compliance with postoperative care instructions,  
• ability to return to work and normal activity , and

the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
• Subject self -assessment:  
• Each subject  will be asked to complete a follow -up N eck Disability Index 
(NDI) form, SF -36 form and a Neck and Shoulder/Arm Pain VAS form at 
each follow -up visit.  
• Radiographic assessment: Each subject  will undergo AP , lateral and flexion 
extension x-rays at the 6, 12 and 24  month visit to assess:  
• Presence / absence of heterotopic  bone at the fusion site or at adjacent 
vertebral levels  
• integrity of the device, with observation for  events such as plate and/or 
spacer migration or subsidence, hardware fracture, and progress towards 
fusion consolidation  
Findings from any additional imaging studies deemed necessary by [CONTACT_418510].  
Published data from the current literature will be gathered for purposes of comparing 
operating room time and the surgeon’s assessment of fusion compared with that reported 
in this study.  
4.[ADDRESS_527914] Assessment     
An independent radiographic analysis will be performed t o evaluate all images and 
assess subjects’  radiographic status.  The following quantitative and qualitative 
assessments will be performed.  
4.4.1  Plate Location Measurements  
Plate location measurements including the distance from end of p late to adjacent level at 
both the ceph alad and caudal  ends of the plate, d istance from the point of screw insertion  
(center line of screw) to endplate of affected level  at both the cephalad and caudal ends 
of the plate and s crew angulation at both the cephalad and caudal ends of t he plate at 
each time point  will be assessed quantitatively using validated computer -assisted 
measurement tools .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 of 23  CP-059-03 
20-Jun-2011 4.4.2  Disc Height  
Anterior and posterior disc height will be assessed quantitatively using validated 
computer -assisted measurement tools. Disc height  will be calculated from neutral lateral 
radiographs.  Anterior (posterior) disc height is defined as the distance between the anterior -inferior (posterior -inferior) corner of the superior vertebra, and the corresponding 
corner of the inferior vertebra.  T his distance is measured perpendicular to the superior 
endplate of the inferior vertebra.  Average disc height is calculated as the simple average 
of the anterior and posterior disc heights.  Disc Height  will be reported in units of 
millimeters . 
4.4.3  Change in Disc Height  
Change in disc height is defined as the change in distance between the anterior -inferior 
(posterior -inferior) corner of the superior vertebra, and the corresponding corner of the 
inferior vertebra.  This change is measured perpendicular to the superior endplate of the 
inferior vertebra.  Change in average disc height is calculated as the simple average of 
the change in anter ior and posterior disc heights.  Change in disc height is calculated by 
[CONTACT_418511] a baseline disc height 
measurement.  The results  will be recorded in units of millimeters . 
4.4.4  Disc Degeneration  
Disc Degeneration, including Adjacent Level Degeneration, will be qualitatively graded in accordance with the following definitions (adapte d from Weiner et al  
3, Lane et al 4 and 
Wilke et al 5): 
0. None: No disc space narrowing, no osteophytes, no endplate sclerosis  
1. Mild:  < 33% disc space narrowing, mild osteophytes, no endplate sclerosis  
2. Moderate:  33% - 66% disc space narrowing, moderate osteophytes, mild to 
moderate endplate sclerosis  
3. Severe:  ≥ 67% disc space narrowing, severe osteophytes or bridging, severe 
endplate sclerosis  
It should be observed that Disc Degeneration is assessed from an evaluation of 3 component factors: Disc Space Narrowing, Osteophyte Formation, and Endplate 
Sclerosis . Disease severity will be defined by [CONTACT_418512].

• Grade 0 – None  
• Grade 1 – Mild (if the ossification extended across <50% of the disc space)  
• Grade 2 – Moderate (if the ossification extended across ≥ 50% of the disc space)  
• Grade 3 – Severe (if there is complete bridging of the adjacent disc space)  
4.4.6  Fusion Determination 
Fusion will be assessed by [CONTACT_418513].  The radiographic report (if ava ilable) and the x -rays will be sent to 
an independent radiologist for review at the end of the study.  X -rays will be evaluated at 
each visit for fusion determination.  The grading system is as follows:   
• Grade 1 -  No graft incorporation  
• Grade 2 -  Incomple te graft incorporation  
• Grade 3 -  Graft Incorporation  
• Grade 4 -  Solid fusion with graft incorporation  
 
Radiographic Success: Radiographic success is defined by [CONTACT_418514] (Grade 3 or 4)

a final evaluation form will be completed.  
  
 
5 COMPLICATIONS  Other Conditions for Withdrawal:  
Any subject who develops a severe concurrent medical illness during the post market 
surveillance study should be withdrawn.  This type of illness is defined as any illness that 
would hinder the subject’s ability to return for scheduled follow -up appointments.  Such a 
withdrawal will not be counted for the purposes of determining success or failure.  
In addition to the standard operating procedures for reporting complications per 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/physician protocol, all clinical events, including both observed or volunteered 
problems, complaints, symptoms, physical signs or disease which either occur during the 
study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseli ne, appear to worsen during 
the clinical outcomes collection study are to be recorded as complications in the subject’s 
medical record and on the appropriate case report form .  In addition for any cleared 
device, a Product Experience Report (PER) must be c ompleted per the manufacturer’s 
customary complaint procedure (SOP 114.0.1 –  Product Complaint Procedure).  
5.1 Definition 
A complication is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the identity, quality, durability, r eliability, safety, effectiveness, performance, or 
any indication of the failure of a device to meet a user or customer’s expectations. The complaint may be the possible failure of a device, labeling, or packaging to meet any of its specifications after it  is released for distribution.

The sample size for this study was based on the number of patients needed in order to 
calculate, within a precision of 10%, a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of 
patients with moderate- to-severe adjacent -level ossification.  The “precision” of a 
confidence interval refers to the distance from the estimated proportion (point estimate) to 
the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval.  The full width of the confidence interval is twice the precision.  This sample size assumes that the rate of incidence will be 
approximately what was observed in a study conducted by [CONTACT_418516], et.al
2.  This study 
indicates that rate of incidenc e of moderate- to-severe adjacent -level ossification 
observed in this study for patients with a PDD of > 5mm is 45.5%.  Under this 
assumption, a sample size of 96 patients will allow a precision of 10% to be achieved.  
Accounting for possible attrition of up to 15% gives a sample size of [ADDRESS_527919]

limited to the physician or physician’s assistant.  All users will be given a unique user 
name [CONTACT_418532] a specific role.  The role determines the level of 
access granted to each user.  Study monitors will have access to subject  numbers only; 
any subject  identifying information will be blocked.  In the event the site does not have 
Internet access, data will be recorded on paper Case Report Forms (CRFs).    
Incoming data are reviewed to identify inconsistent or missing data and Adverse Events.  Data inconsistencies will be addressed through telephone calls, faxes, or emails to the 
Investigational Sites and during site visits.  All hard copy forms and data files will be 
secured to ensure confidentiality.

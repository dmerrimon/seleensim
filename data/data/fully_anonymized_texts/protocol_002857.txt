Study Design This will be a 4-visit, random ized, controlled, single-masked, 
bilateral wear, dispensing, 2-treament, 2-sequence, 3- period
crossover study. Each subject w ill be randomized into one of 
twounique sequences to wear two different study lenses one 
at a time over three wear periods (test/control/ control or 
control /test/test). During each wear period the lenses will be 
worn bilaterally for approximately 1 week (7 r2days) in a 
daily disposable modality . Subjective CLUE Comfort, V ision 
and Handling will be assessed using the CLUE questionnaire 
at both fitting and follow -up visits for each wear period.
HLHC VA will be assessed at the follow -up evaluation using 
ETDRS charts. There will be no washout period between wear 
periods.

1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
High Energy Visible Light (HEVL) may be gene rally defined as the visible region of the 
electromagnetic spectrum with wavelengths shorter than [ADDRESS_1148549] when looking at 
distant objects. At approximately 435 nm, visib le light has enough energy to damage the retinal 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_827798]. A dditionally, the retinal 
receptors responsible for photoentrainment (entrainment of the circadian rhythm in response to patterns of light and dark) are maximally sensitive to light at approximately 480 nm. 
Ophthalmic lenses that block High Energy Visible Light (HEVL) may offer improved vision 
through enhanced chromatic contrast  sensitivity. Such lenses may also provide greater retinal 
protection than regular lenses without spectral filtering. This study will investigate the subjective visual response to a daily disposable, toric lens design incorporating a HEVL-blocking chromophore (RTY-1) against the ACUVUE® OASYS 1-Day for ASTIGMATISM 
(AO1DfA) design as control. 
1.1. Name [CONTACT_827813] a toric c ontact lens design with stabilization design and 
geometry similar to AO1DfA in senofilcon A (C3) with the addition of a HEVL-blockingchromophore (RTY-1). The test lens will be evaluated against the AO1DfA lens in as control. 
Further details about the test and control artic les are given in section [ADDRESS_1148550] 8 hours 
per day and 5 days per week over a wear peri od of 7±[ADDRESS_1148551] version of the Investigator's Brochure
5and the AO1DfA 
package insert (Appendix C), respectively.
1.4. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects 
The anticipated clinical benefit of the investigati onal lenses will be the correction of refractive 
error. No adverse device effects are antici pated. The risks associated with use of the 
CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 16 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
investigational lenses are considered to be th e same as those for other marketed soft contact 
[CONTACT_827803] (i.e., daily di sposable wear). No additional risks associated 
with participation in this investigation are anticipated. 
Comprehensive risk and bene fit information regarding the test design and the AO1DfA control 
lens are included in the latest versions of the Investigator's Brochure5and the AO1DfA package 
insert (Appendix C), respectively.
1.5. Relevant Literature References and Pr ior Clinical Data Relevant to Proposed 
Clinical Study 
Prototype toric lens designs featuring the RTY -[ADDRESS_1148552] ACU VUE OASYS 2 -week for Astigmatism as control (study 
), and in a daily disposable modality against AO1DfA as control (study ). 
In study , out of the 98 subjects included in the safety population, one ocular adverse 
event (AE) was repor ted; non -significant meibomianitis was reported in the right eye of one 
subject, and this was considered to have no re lation to the investigational articles or study 
procedures. No ocular adverse events were reported in. 
In study , [ADDRESS_1148553] 
designs and the AO1DfA control lens, refer to the Investigator's Brochure5and the AO1DfA 
package insert (Appendix C), respectively.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES, ENDPOINTS AND HYPOTHESES 
2.1. Objectives  
Primary Objective
The primary objective of this study is to eval uate and compare the subjective CLUE Comfort 
of the HEVL-blocking test design against AO1DfA as control.
Exploratory Objectives
Exploratory objectives of this study will be to  evaluate the subjective CLUE Vision, subjective 
CLUE Handling, lens fitting characteristics, rotation performance, visual acuity, ocular physiological response and cosmetic acceptability for the test and control designs.
2.2. Endpoints  
Primary EndpointThe primary endpoint will be the responses to  the CLUE questionnaire Comfort items at the 
follow-up evaluation.
CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 17 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
Subjective comfort will be assessed us ing Contact [CONTACT_169754] (CLUE) 
questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-re ported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient-
experience attributes of soft, disposable contact [CONTACT_13276] (Comfort, Vision, Handling, and 
Packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in  the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal 
distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more 
favorable/positive response.6A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% 
shift in the distribution of scores for population of soft disposable contact [CONTACT_19554].
The CLUE questionnaire was selected for the primary endpoint since this is thought to be the 
best psychometric method available for evalu ating and quantifying subjective lens comfort. 
The follow-up CLUE questionnaire was selected since this allows the ample time for subjects to subjectively assess lens performance over a variety of wear conditions.

4. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE 
4.1. Description of Study Design 
This will be a 4-visit, randomized, control led, single-masked, bilater al wear, dispensing,
2-treatment, 2-sequence, 3-period crossover study. Each subject will be randomized into one 
of two unique sequences to wear two different  study lenses one at a time over three wear 
periods (test/control/control or control/test/test). D uring each wear period, study lenses will be 
worn bilaterally for approximately 1 week (7 r2 days) in a daily disposable modality. Study 
lenses will be worn for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1148559] performing 
currently marketed ACUVUE® toric lens in terms  of comfort. The prescribed wear schedule 
(lenses to be worn for a minimum of 8 hours pe r day and a minimum of 5 days per week) was 
chosen as this is representative of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_126091].
CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 20 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
For the primary study endpoint, the CLUE questi onnaire was selected on the basis of being the 
best available validated PRO tool for asse ssing the subjective comfort of soft contact [CONTACT_89626].
The investigational lenses will be fitted by [CONTACT_827807].
4.3. Enrollment Target and Study Duration 
This study will have an e nrollment target of [ADDRESS_1148560];  total study duration including the enrollment period 
is expected to be approximately [ADDRESS_1148561]’s last visit. Subjects who are di scontinued prior to the final evaluation may be 
replaced at the discretion of the study sponsor. Th e investigation will end at the time that the
study data is hard locked.
5. TEST ARTICLE ALLOCATION AND MASKING 
5.1. Test Article Allocation  
This study will be a randomized, single-masked, crossover design. Subjects will be randomized 
into one of two unique sequence groups in a 1:1 allocation ratio to wear two different study 
lens designs (test and control designs) one at a time bilaterally over three wear periods. 
Use of the test articles will be randomized us ing a randomization scheme supplied by [CONTACT_142452].  The randomized assignment of subj ects will be performed at the first visit prior 
to the first fitting. Clinical sites will follow the randomization scheme provided and will not 
pre-select or assign subjects. The following mu st have occurred prior to randomization:
xInformed consent must have been obtained
xThe subject must have met all inclusion and exclusion criteria
xThe subject history and baseline information must have been collected
Randomly permuted block randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of 
subjects to treatment and to enhance the vali dity of statistical comparisons across treatment 
groups.When dispensing test articles, the following steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes:
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the 
randomization scheme (lens fitting schedule) to obtain the test article assignment for 
that subject prior to dispensing.
CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 21 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
2.Investigator or designee will record the subj ect’s number on the appropriate line of the 
randomization scheme (lens fitting schedule).
3. Investigator or designee will pull the appropriate test articles from the study supply. 
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed 
outside the clinical site) or not, must be re corded on the Test Article Accountability 
Log in the “Dispensed” section.
5.2. Masking 
To reduce the potential for bias, this will be a single-masked trial; subjects will not be aware 
of the identity of the assigned lenses, however, du e to the difference in appearance of the test 
lenses containing the RTY-[ADDRESS_1148562] and control desi gns. The identity (i.e., brand and type) of the 
study lenses will be masked by [CONTACT_827808] r packs labeled with the study number, lot 
number, sphere power, cylinder power, axis , expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] a nd randomization code. 
Investigators, site staff and sponsor personnel (i ncluding the medical monitor) will be aware 
of the identity of the test and control lenses. 
5.3. Procedures for Maintaining and Breaking the Masking 
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until all subjects have completed 
the study and the database is fi nalized. Otherwise, the mask shoul d be broken only if specific 
emergency treatment/course of ac tion would be dictated by [CONTACT_827809]. In such cases, the Investigator may, in an emergency, contact [CONTACT_7195]. In the event the mask is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, 
time, and reason for the unmasking must be documented in the subject record. 
Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unmasked ar e expected to return for all 
remaining scheduled evaluations. Subjects who are discontinued may be replaced at the 
discretion of the study sponsor.

6.6. Collection and Storage of Samples 
No samples will be collected as part of th e study procedures. When possible, any lens or test 
article associated with an Adverse Event and/or a Product Quality Complaint must be retained 
and stored in a glass vial with moderate so lution pending directions from the sponsor for 
potential return to JJVC.
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles 
JJVC will provide the Investigator with sufficient  quantities of study articles and supplies to 
complete the investigation. The Investigator is asked to retain all lens shipment documentation 
for the test article accountability records. 
Test articles must be kept in a locked storage  cabinet, accessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this activity to authorized study site personnel listed on the Site Delegation Log. All test articles must be accounted. This includes:
1. What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or issued 
for the subject to replace appropriately between visits.
2. What was returned to the Investigator unused, including expi[INVESTIGATOR_93785].
3. The number and reason for unplanned replacements.
The Investigator will collect all unused test articles  from the subjects at the end of the subject’s 
participation. Subject returned unused test articles must be separated from the clinical study 
inventory of un-dispensed test articles and must be labeled with the subject number and date 
of return. Following final reconciliation of test articles by [CONTACT_2037], the Investigator or 
monitor will return all unused test articles to JJVC.
If there is a discrepancy between the shipment documents and the contents, contact [CONTACT_35501] .

10. DEVIATIONS FROM THE PROTOCOL 
Investigator will notify study sponsor upon iden tification of a protocol deviation. Protocol 
deviations must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after discovery of the protocol 
deviation. The Investigator will report deviations  per IRB/IEC requirements. All deviations 
will be tracked, and corrective act ions implemented as appropriate. 
If it becomes necessary for the Investigator to implement a deviation in order to eliminate an immediate hazard to the trial subject, th e Investigator may implement the deviation 
immediately without notification to the spons or. Within [ADDRESS_1148614] notify and provi de the rationale to the Sponsor and, as 
required, the IEC/IRB. 
If the deviation potentially impacts the safety of patient or changes the technical integrity of 
the study, then it must be reported to IEC/IRB. This is a "Major Deviation". Deviations
that contradict the information contained in the Informed Consent/Assent forms will be
considered Major Deviations.
Minor deviations have no substantive effect on patient safety or technical integrity of the 
study. They are often logistical in nature. Protocol waivers are prohibited.Table 5 lists examples of deviations that will constitute major and minor protocol deviations
for this study. Table 5: Examples of major and minor protocol deviations

lenses for at least [ADDRESS_1148615] ([LOCATION_003]DE), or 
any SAE where the relationship to study agent cannot be ruled out, may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35446]. In the event of a [LOCATION_003]DE or SAE, the Sponsor may unmask the treatment regimen for the subject(s) and w ill discuss this with the Investigator before any 
further subjects are enrolled.
The Sponsor will determine when a study will be stopped. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_126095]’s results are compromised.
JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason. Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study  if an unreasonable risk is determined. The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_126117], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is determined 
that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) w ill evaluate all adverse events. If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unre asonable risk, the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated as soon as possible.

12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS 
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to an y written, electronic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies relate d to the identity, quality, dura bility, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after th ey have been released for clinical trial use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources including but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations managers (COM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered product quality complaints:
xSubject satisfaction inquiries reported via “Subjective Questionna ires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO). ”
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the investigational site.
xLens replacements that occur due to drops/fall-outs.
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations where 
there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_423].
Within [ADDRESS_1148616] be recorded in the EDC system, which will tr igger an automatic email notification to the 
appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use is not configured to send automatic notificati ons or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.  
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/CR A will contact [CONTACT_19568]: 
xDate the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness).
xWho received the complaint.
xStudy number.
xClinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number).
xLot number(s).
xUnique Subject Identifier(s).
xIndication of who first observed complaint (site personnel or subject).
xOD/OS indication, along with whether the lens was inserted.
xAny related AE number if applicable.
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.).
xEye Care Provider objective (sli t lamp) findings if applicable.
CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 44 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xConfirmation of product availability f or return (and tracking information, if available), 
or rationale if product is not available for return 
Once a complaint is received, it will be asse ssed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Seri ous Adverse Event (AE/SAE). If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or traine d site personnel will follow section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result  of a product quality related deficiency, these 
procedures also applies and will be executed in parallel.  
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514]. In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Bla nk” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be 
documented.
13. ADVERSE EVENTS 
13.1. Definitions and Classifications 
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrenc e, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not related to  the investigational medical device. ”
Note : This definition includes events related to  the investigational medical device or the 
comparator, and to the procedures involved. For users or other persons, this definition is 
restricted to events related to investigational medical devices.1
An AE includes any condition (including a pre-existing condition) that:
1. Was not present prior to the study, but a ppeared or reappeared following initiation of 
the study.
2. Was present prior to the study but worsen ed during the study. This would include any 
condition resulting from concomitant illnesse s, reactions to concomitant medications, 
or progression of disease states.
Note : Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse event and must be reported to the clinical 
monitor and to the Sponsor immediately upon learning of the event.
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) –An SAE is any adverse event that led to any of the following:
xDeath
xSerious deterioration in the health of the subj ect that resulted in any of the following:
xLife-threatening illness or injury
xPermanent or persistent impairment of a body structure or a body function
xHospi[INVESTIGATOR_35448]-threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function.

Non-Significant Adverse Events –are defined as those events that are usually asymptomatic 
and usually do not warrant discontinuation of c ontact lens wear but may cause a reduction in 
wear time.  However, the Investigator may choos e to prescribe treatment as a precautionary 
measure.
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Oc ular Non-Significant Adverse Events include, 
but not limited to the following:
xNon-significant Infiltrative Event (NSIE)

xLocalized Allergic Reactions
xAny corneal event not explicitly defined as serious or significant adverse event, which 
necessitates temporary lens discontinuation < [ADDRESS_1148618] (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device. ”
NOTE 1: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or 
any malfunction of the investigational medical device.
NOTE 2: This definition includes any event re sulting from use error or from intentional 
misuse of the investigational medical device.[ADDRESS_1148619] (UADE) –A UADE is any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test 
article, if that effect, problem, or death was not  previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational p lan, Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem  associated with the test article that relates to the rights, 
safety and welfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events 
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Invest igator will evaluate adverse events to ensure 
the events are categorized correctly. Elements of categorization will include:
xSeriousness/Classifications (see definition in section 13.1).
xCausality or Relatedness –i.e. the relationship between the test article, study treatment
or study procedures and the adverse event (not related, unlikely related, possiblyrelated, or related - see definition in section 13.2.1).
xAdverse Event Severity –Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild, m oderate, or severe - see definition in 
section 13.2.2).
xOutcome –not recovered or not resolved, rec overing or resolving, recovered or 
resolved with sequelae, recovered or reso lved, death related to adverse event, or
unknown.
xActions Taken –none, temporarily discontinued, permanently discontinued, or other.
13.2.1. Causality Assessment 
Causality Assessment –A determination of the relationship be tween an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article relationship for each  adverse event should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]:
xNot Related- An adverse event that is not re lated to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures.
xUnlikely Related –An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomi tant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely.
CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 47 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xPossibly Related –An adverse event that might be due  to the use of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An  alternative explanation, e.g. concomitant 
treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable. Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded.
xRelated –An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or adverse 
reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably exp lained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g. 
concomitant treatment of c oncomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very 
suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challenge and re-challenge.
13.2.2. Severity Assessment 
Severity Assessment –A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_126121]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of test article, st udy treatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:
xMild –Event is noticeable to the subject but is  easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities .
xModerate –Event is bothersome, possible requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities .
xSevere –Event is intolerable, necessitates additi onal therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities .
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events 
The recording and documenting of adverse events  (ocular and non-ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if th e condition deteriorates at any time during the 
study, it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the 
subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as ad verse events at the discretion of the 
Investigator.
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal In vestigator will document the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs and complete the Adverse Event eCRF.  Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic re actions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be capture d on the appropriate case report form or electronic data system. 
All adverse events occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study  must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain  documentation of each reported adverse event. 
All adverse events will be followed in accordan ce with applicable licensing requirements. Such 
documentation will include the following:
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom).
xDrawings or photographs (where appropriate) that detail the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.).
CR-6484, v 1.0

[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xDate the clinical site was notified.
xDate and time of onset.
xDate and time of resolution.
xAdverse event classification, severity, and relationship to test articles, as applicable.
xTreatment regimen instituted (where appropr iate), including concomitant medications 
prescribed, in accordance with a pplicable licensin g requirements.
xAny referral to another health care provider if needed.
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any).
xLikely etiology.
xBest corrected visual acuity at the disc overy of the event and upon conclusion of the
event if the AE is related to the visual system.
Upon discovery of an AE that is deemed ‘possibly related ’or ‘related ’to the test article or 
study procedures (whether related to the visual system or not), a nAE review form 
must be completed .Additional dated and initialed entries should be made atfollow -up 
evaluations .Separate forms must be completed for each eye if the AE is bilateral. 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the corneal les ion will be collected to determine if the 
infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, the date of  culture collection and 
laboratory utilized will be recorded. 
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of in tensity to be performed. Adve rse events characterized as 
intermittent require doc umentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the 
assessment of relationship to the Test Article shall also be clearly documented.Subjects who present with an adverse event shall be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved. If further treatm ent beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provi der. The Investigator will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study. If a subject is discontinued from the study, it w ill be the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation. The Investig ator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Even t eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse 
events related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures, as of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resolution of the adverse event or until referral to an appropriate health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_57748]. Non-ocular adverse events that are 
not related to the test article, study treatmen t, or study procedures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow -up.
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e-mail , facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for any serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for an y non-significant adverse event. In addition,

their requirements (section 13.4.2). The report will comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures.
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor 
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/significant adverse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e-mail or telephone, but no later than [ADDRESS_1148620] igator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All subjects experiencing a serious/si gnificant adverse event must be  followed up and all outcomes 
must be reported.
When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the randomization code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subject  received. The Sponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must:
xNotify the Sponsor immediately.
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who assisted  in the treatment and follow-up of the 
subject.
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not related to the use of the test article.
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedure according to national regulations.
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_1148621] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_1148622].
Non-Serious Adverse Events
All non-serious adverse events, including non-seri ous adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery.
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities 
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will ref er to and follow any guidelines set forth 
CR-6484, v 1.0

[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19582].
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according to
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines. 
13.5. Event of Special Interest 
None.
13.6. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) durin g the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event. Once  discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes. Pregnant participants are not discontinued from contact [CONTACT_126124] d studies for safety concerns, but due to 
general concerns relating to pregna ncy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. Spec ifically, pregnant women are 
discontinued due to fluctuations in  refractive error and/or visual  acuity that occur secondary to 
systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unfor eseen health risks to the mother or fetus.
14. STATISTICAL METHODS 
14.1. General Considerations 
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_35522]. A 
general description of the statistical methods to be implemented in this clinical trial is outlined 
below.
All data summaries and statistical analyses w ill be performed using Statistical Analysis
System (SAS) software Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Throughout the
analysis of data, the results for each subject/eye will be used when available for summarization 
and statistical analysis. Unscheduled visits will / will not be summarized separately and will /
will not be excluded from the statistical analysis.
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or freque ncy tables) will be provided for all baseline 
variables, efficacy variables and safety variable s as appropriate. Continuous variables will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum 
and maximum). Frequency count an d percentage of subjects or eyes within each category will 
be provided for categorical data.
14.2. Sample Size Justification 
The plan is to enroll [ADDRESS_1148623] 126 subjects to complete .The power 
calculation isbased on 2-sequence and 3-period (Test/Control/ Control or Control/ Test/Test) 
crossover study design and study results from  whereprototype toric lens designs with 
the RTY -[ADDRESS_1148624] relative to the Control .

As shown in the Table 6, the study will be  powered (power of 0.8 or higher) to show non-
inferiority of the Test relative to the Control len s with respect to CLUE Comfort score when 
the mean difference ≥ 0, the standard deviation ≤ 25 andan intraclass correlation ≥ 0.4.
14.3. Analysis Populations 
Safety Population:
All subjects who are administered any test article excluding subjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At lea st one observation should be recorded.
Per-Protocol Population: All subjects who successfully complete all visi ts and do not substantially deviate from the 
protocol as determined by [CONTACT_126125]. 
Justification for the exclusion of subjects wi th protocol deviations from the Per-Protocol 
Population set will be documented in a memo to file.
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population:
All randomized subjects regardless of actual tr eatment and subsequent withdrawal from the 
study or deviation from the protocol. At least one observation should be recorded.

14.4. Level of Statistical Significance 
The primary analysis for this study will be conducted with an overall type I error rate of 5%. 
If any post-hoc statistical analysis after reviewi ng data is conducted, a type I error rate of 5% 
will be used for exploratory purposes.
14.5. Primary Analysis  
CLUE Comfort score
CLUE Comfort scores at 1-week follow-up will be  analyzed using a linear mixed effect model 
to compare between the Test and Control lenses . The model will include the baseline score,
sequence, lens type, lens wearing period, and first order carryover effect as fixed effects.
Additional fixed effects will include subjec t characteristics such as age and gender. 
Investigational site will be included as a random intercept. The covariance of residual errors between different periods for the same subj ect will be modeled using either homogenous 
compound symmetry (CS), heterogeneous compo und-symmetry (HCS) or unstructured (UN) 
covariance structure. The structure that returns the lowest finite sample corrected Akaike’s 
Information criterion will be selected as the structure that best fits the model.
8The Kenward 
and Roger method will be used for the ca lculation of the denominator degree of freedom.[ADDRESS_1148626] - Control is as follows:
 
ܪ0: Δ < -5
ܪA:Δ ≥ -[ADDRESS_1148627] square mean (LSM) difference of CLUE Comfort score at 1-week follow-
up between the Test and Control lens (Test minus C ontrol). Non-inferiority will be declared if 
the corresponding lower bound of the 95% two-side d confidence interval (CI) of the least 
squares mean (LSM) difference (Test - Control) for CLUE Comfort score at 1-week follow-
up based on the per-protocol population is greater than -5.

WARNING: UV absorbing contact [CONTACT_35539], such as UV absorbing goggles or sunglasses because they do not completely cover the eye and surrounding area. The patient should continue to use UV absorbing eyewear as directed.
ACTIONS
In its hydrated state, the contact [CONTACT_13293], when placed on the cornea, acts as a refracting medium to focus light rays onto the retina.
The transmittance characteristics for these lenses are less than 1% in the 
UVB range of 280 nm to 315 nm and less than 10% in the UVA range of 316 nm to 380 nm for the entire range.

Page 85 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
• Corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity).
• Any systemic disease that may affect the eye or be exaggerated by 
[CONTACT_35543].
• Allergic reactions of ocular surfaces or adnexa that may be induced 
or exaggerated by [CONTACT_71186].
• Ocular irritation due to allergic reactions which may be caused by 
[CONTACT_35545] (i.e., rewetting drops) that contain chemicals or preservatives (such as mercury, Thimerosal, etc.) to which some people may develop an allergic response.
• Any active corneal infection (bacterial, fungal, protozoal, or viral).
• If eyes become red or irritated.
WARNINGS
Patients should be advised of the following warnings pertaining to 
contact [CONTACT_13279]:
EYE PROBLEMS, INCLUDING CORNEAL ULCERS, CAN DEVELOP 
RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_35458]; IF THE PATIENT EXPE-RIENCES:
• Eye Discomfort,
• Excessive Tearing,• Vision Changes,• Loss of Vision,• Eye Redness,• Or Other Eye Problems, 
THE PATIENT SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO IMMEDIATELY RE-
MOVE THE LENSES AND PROMPTLY CONTACT [CONTACT_35546].
• When prescribed for daily wear, patients should be instructed not 
to wear lenses while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Clinical studies have shown that 
the risk of serious advers actions is increased when lenses are worn overnight, and that   of ulcerative keratitis is greater for 
CR-6484, v 1.0 -  (13) 
Page [ADDRESS_1148632] lens users than for daily wear users.3
• Studies have shown that contact [CONTACT_126129] a higher incidence of adverse reactions than nonsmokers.
• Problems with contact [CONTACT_126130]. Patients should be cautioned that proper 
use and care of contact [CONTACT_126131].
• The overall risk of ulcerative keratitis may be reduced by [CONTACT_126132].

Speciﬁ  c Instructions for Use and Warnings:
• Water Activity
Instructions for Use
Do not expose contact [CONTACT_35551].WARNING:
Water can harbor microorganisms that can lead to severe infection, vision loss or blindness. If lenses have been submersed in water when participating in water sports or swimming in pools, hot tubs, lakes, or oceans, the patient should be instructed to discard them and replace them with a new pair. The Eye Care Professional should be consulted for recommendations regarding wearing lenses during any activity involving water.
PRECAUTIONS
Special Precautions for Eye Care Professionals:
• Due to the small number of patients enrolled in clinical investiga-
tion of lenses, all refractive powers, design conﬁ  gurations, or lens parameters available in the lens material are not evaluated in signif-icant numbers. Consequently, when selecting an appropriate lens design and parameters, the Eye Care Professional should consider all characteristics of the lens that can affect lens performance and ocular health, including oxygen permeability, wettability, central and peripheral thickness, and optic zone diameter.
CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 87 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
• The potential impact of these factors on the patient’s ocular health 
should be carefully weighed against the patient’s need for refractive 
correction; therefore, the continuing ocular health of the patient and lens performance on the eye should be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_71187].
• Patients who wear these lenses to correct presby[CONTACT_35553]-
vision may not achieve the best corrected visual acuity for either far or near vision. Visual requirements vary with the individual and should be considered when selecting the most appropriate type of lens for each patient.
• Fluorescein, a yellow dye, should not be used while the lenses are 
on the eyes. The lenses absorb this dye and become discolored. Whenever ﬂ  uorescein is used in eyes, the eyes should be ﬂ  ushed with a sterile saline solution that is recommended for in-eye use.
• Eye Care Professionals should instruct the patient to remove the 
lenses immediately if the eyes become red or irritated. 
Eye Care Professionals should carefully instruct patients about the following care regimen and safety precautions.
Handling Precautions:
• Before leaving the Eye Care Professional’s ofﬁ  ce, the patient should 
be able to promptly remove the lenses or should have someone 
else available who can remove the lenses for him or her. 
• DO NOT use if the sterile blister package is opened or damaged. 
• Always wash and rinse hands before handling lenses. Do not get 
cosmetics, lotions, soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in the 
eyes or on the lenses. It is best to put on lenses before putting on makeup. Water-based cosmetics are less likely to damage lenses than oil-based products. 
• DO NOT touch contact [CONTACT_35554] ﬁ  ngers or hands if the 
hands are not free of foreign materials, as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision and/or injury to the eye.
• Carefully follow the handlin in rt n, removal, and wearing 
instructions in the “Patient t ct n Guide” for the prescribed 
CR-6484, v 1.0 - (  
 
Page 88 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
wearing schedule and those prescribed by [CONTACT_35555].
• Always handle lenses carefully and avoid droppi[INVESTIGATOR_35459].
• Never use tweezers or other tools to remove lenses from the lens 
container unless speciﬁ  cally indicated for that use. Slide the lens up 
the side of the bowl until it is free of the container. 
• Do not touch the lens with ﬁ  ngernails. 
Lens Wearing Precautions:
• If the lens sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recom-
mended directions in “Care for a Sticking (Non-Moving) Lens." The lens should move freely on the eye for the continued health of the eye. If non-movement of the lens continues, the patient should be instructed to immediately consult his or her Eye Care Professional.
• Never wear lenses beyond the period recommended by [CONTACT_71188].
• The patient should be advised to never allow anyone else to wear 
their lenses. They have been prescribed to ﬁ  t their eyes and to correct their vision to the degree necessary. Sharing lenses greatly increases the chance of eye infections.
• If aerosol products, such as hair spray, are used while wearing 
lenses, exercise caution and keep eyes closed until the spray has settled.
• Avoid all harmful or irritating vapors and fumes while wearing 
lenses. 
• Always discard lenses worn as prescribed by [CONTACT_35555]. 
Lens Care Precautions:  
• The patient should be informed that no cleaning or disinfection is 
needed when lenses are worn for daily disposable wear.  Patients should always dispose of lenses when removed and have spare lenses or spectacles available.
CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 89 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Other Topi[INVESTIGATOR_35460]:
• Always contact [CONTACT_35558]-
cine in the eyes. 
• Certain medications, such as antihistamines, decongestants, 
diuretics, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, and those for motion 
sickness may cause dryness of the eye, increased lens awareness, or blurred vision. Should such conditions exist, proper remedial measures should be prescribed. Depending on the severity, this could include the use of lubricating drops that are indicated for use with soft contact [CONTACT_71189]. 
• Oral contraceptive users could develop visual changes or changes 
in lens tolerance when using contact [CONTACT_13276]. Patients should be cautioned accordingly. 
• As with any contact [CONTACT_13293], follow-up visits are necessary to assure 
the continuing health of the patient’s eyes. The patient should be instructed as to a recommended follow-up schedule. 
Who Should Know That the Patient is Wearing Contact [CONTACT_32993]?
• Patients should inform all doctors (Health Care Professionals) about 
being a contact [CONTACT_35560]. 
• Patients should always inform their employer of being a contact 
[CONTACT_35560]. Some jobs may require use of eye protection equip-ment or may require that the patient not wear contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The patient should be informed that the following problems may occur when wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]:
• The eye may burn, sting, and/or itch.
• There may be less comfort than when the lens was ﬁ  rst placed on 
the eye.
• There may be a feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, 
scratched area).
• There may be the potenti e temporary impairment due to CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 90 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
peripheral inﬁ  ltrates, peripheral corneal ulcers, or corneal erosion. 
There may be the potential for other physiological observations, such as local or generalized edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, injection, tarsal abnormalities, iritis, and conjuncti-vitis; some of which are clinically acceptable in low amounts.
• There may be excessive watering, unusual eye secretions, or 
redness of the eye.
• Poor visual acuity, blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around 
objects, photophobia, or dry eyes may also occur if the lenses are worn continuously or for too long a time.
The patient should be instructed to conduct a simple 3-part self-examina-tion at least once a day. They should ask themselves:
• How do the lenses feel on my eyes?
• How do my eyes look?• Have I noticed a change in my vision? 
If the patient reports any problems, he or she should be instructed to 
IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LENS. If the problem or discomfort stops, the patient should discard the lens and place a new fresh lens on the eye.
If after inserting the new lens, the problem continues, the patient should be 
directed to IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LENS AND CONTACT [CONTACT_35561].
The patient should be instructed NOT to use a new lens as self-treatment 
for the problem.
The patient should be advised that when any of the above symptoms oc-
cur, a serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, neovascularization, or iritis may be present. He or she should be instructed to seek immediate professional identiﬁ  cation of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid serious eye damage.

GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES
A. Patient Selection
Patients selected to wear these lenses should be chosen based on: 
• Motivation to wear lenses 
• Ability to follow instructions regarding lens wear care
• General health 
• Ability to adequately handle and care for the lenses 
• Ability to understand the risk and beneﬁ  ts of lens wear
Patients who do not meet the above criteria should not be provided with 
contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
B. Pre-ﬁ  tting Examination
Initial evaluation of the patient should begin with a thorough case history 
to determine if there are any contraindications to contact [CONTACT_13279]. During 
the case history, the patient’s visual needs and expectations should be 
determined as well as an assessment of their overall ocular, physical, and 
mental health. 
Preceding the initial selection of trial contact [CONTACT_13276], a comprehensive 
ocular evaluation should be performed that includes, but is not limited to, 
the measurement of distance and near visual acuity, distance and near 
refractive prescription (including determining the preferred reading distance 
for presby[CONTACT_35562]), keratometry, and biomicroscopic evaluation. 
Based on this evaluation, if it is determined that the patient is eligible to 
wear these lenses, the Eye Care Professional should proceed to the lens 
ﬁ  tting instructions as outlined below. 
C. Initial Power Determination
A spectacle refraction should be performed to establish the patient’s 
baseline refractive status and to guide in the selection of the appropriate 
lens power. Remember to compensate for vertex distance if the refraction 
is greater than ±4.00D.
D. Base Curve Selection (Trial Lens Fitting)
The following trial lenses should be selected for patients regardless of kera-
tometry readings. However, corneal curvature measurements should be 
performed to establish the patient’s baseline ocular status. CR-6484, v 1.[ADDRESS_1148633]-0007 (13)

• ACUVUE OASYS® 1-Day: 8.5 mm/14.3 mm
• ACUVUE OASYS® 1-Day for ASTIGMATISM: 8.5 mm/14.3 mm
The trial lens should be placed on each of the patient's eyes and evaluated 
after the patient has adjusted to the lenses.  
1. Criteria of a Properly Fit Lens 
A properly ﬁ  t lens will center and completely cover the cornea (i.e., no limbal exposure), have sufﬁ  cient movement to provide tear exchange under the contact [CONTACT_35563], and be comfortable. The lens should move freely when manipulated digitally with the lower lid, and then return to its properly centered position when released.
2. Criteria of a Flat Fitting Lens 
A ﬂ  at ﬁ  tting lens may exhibit one or more of the following characteris-tics: decentration, incomplete corneal coverage (i.e., limbal exposure), excessive movement with the blink, and/or edge standoff. If the lens is judged to be ﬂ  at ﬁ  tting, it should not be dispensed to the patient.
3. Criteria of a Steep Fitting Lens 
A steep ﬁ  tting lens may exhibit one or more of the following charac-teristics: insufﬁ  cient movement with the blink, conjunctival indentation, and resistance when pushing the lens up digitally with the lower lid. If the lens is judged to be steep ﬁ  tting, it should not be dispensed to the patient.
If the initial trial base curve is judged to be ﬂ  at or steep ﬁ  tting, the alternate base curve, if available, should be trial ﬁ  t and evaluated after the patient has adjusted to the lens. The lens should move freely when manipulated digitally with the lower lid, and then return to a properly centered position when released. If resistance is encountered when pushing the lens up, the lens is ﬁ  tting tightly and should not be dispensed to the patient.
E. Final Lens Power (Spherical)
A spherical over-refraction should be performed to determine the ﬁ  nal lens power after the lens ﬁ  t is judged acceptable. The spherical over-refraction should be combined with the trial lens power to determine the ﬁ  nal lens prescription. The patient should p n e good visual acuity with the correct lens power unless there x ss ve residual astigmatism.

TORIC FITTING GUIDELINES
Although most aspects of the ﬁ  tting procedure are identical for all types 
of soft contact [CONTACT_13276], including toric lenses, there are some additional steps and/or rules to follow to assure the proper ﬁ  t of toric lenses.
The only new steps you must follow in prescribing ACUVUE
 OASYS® 
1-Day for ASTIGMATISM are that you must determine the stability, 
repeatability, and drift angle of the lens axis so that you can prescribe the correct lens axis for the patient.
A. How to Determine Lens Cylinder and Axis Orientation 
1. Locate the Orientation Marks
To help determine the proper orientation of the toric lens, you’ll 
ﬁ  nd two primary marks approximately 1 mm from the lens edge representing the vertical position on opposite ends of the lens at 6 and 12 o’clock (Fig. 1). Because of the lens’ ballasting system, either mark can represent the vertical position – there is no “top” and “bottom” as in a prism-ballasted lens. You don’t need to view both marks to assess orientation; simply look for the 6 o’clock mark as you would with a prism-ballasted lens.
CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 94 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Figure 1
You’ll need a slit lamp biomicroscope with a 1 to 2 mm 
parallelepi[INVESTIGATOR_35462] ﬁ  tted to the eye. There are a number of techniques you can use to improve the visibility of the 6 o’clock mark. Using a parallelepi[INVESTIGATOR_35463]ﬁ  cation (10x or 15x), slowly pan down the lens, looking just below the direct illumination at the retroilluminated area. Backlighting the mark this way should make it more visible. Sometimes manipulating the lower lid may be necessary to uncover the mark.
2. Observe Lens Rotation and Stability
Observe the position and stability of the “bottom” mark. It usually stabilizes at the 6 o’clock position. If it does, calculation of the lens power will be straightforward. The 6 o’clock position is not a “must”; however, the absolute requirement is that the axis position be stable and repeatable.
The mark may stabilize somewhat left or right (drift) of the vertical 
meridian and still enable you to ﬁ  t a toric lens for that eye, as long as the lens always returns to the same “drift axis” position after settling. The deviation can be compensated for in the ﬁ  nal prescription. Your objective is to ensure that whatever position the initial lens assumes near 6 o’clock, this position must be stable and repeatable. With full eye movement or heavy blink, you may see the marks swing away, but they must return quickly to the original stable position. If the lens does not return quickly, you may need to select a different lens.
3. Assessing Rotation
Imagine the eye as a clock dial and every hour represents a 30° interval. If the orientation mark of the initial lens stabilizes somewhat left or right of the vertical position, the ﬁ  nal lens will orient on the eye with the same deviation. You can use an axis reticule in the slit lamp or use a line-scribed lens in a spectacle trial frame to measure or estimate the “drift angle” of the cylinder axis.
To compensate for this “drift”, measure or estimate the “drift”, then 
add or subtract it from the refractive axis to determine the correct cylinder axis. Use the LARS (Left Add, Right Subtract) method to determine which direction to compensate.
CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 95 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
B. Final Lens Power 
When the diagnostic lens has its axis aligned in the same meridian 
as the patient’s refractive axis, a spherocylindrical over-refraction may be performed and visual acuity determined. However, in the case of crossed axes, such as when the diagnostic lens axis is different from the spectacle cylinder axis, it is not advisable to perform a full spherocylindrical over-refraction because of the difﬁ  culty in computing the resultant power. A spherical over-refraction without cylinder refraction may be performed. 
If the required cylinder correction falls between two available cylinder 
powers, it is recommended to prescribe the lower cylinder power lens. See below for instructions on how to determine the ﬁ  nal lens power.
1. For the Sphere
If sphere alone or combined sphere and cylinder Rx > ±4.00D, 
compensate for vertex distance. If sphere alone or combined sphere and cylinder Rx ≤ ±4.00D, vertex compensation is not necessary.
2. For the Cylinder
Adjust the axis by [CONTACT_35564]. Choose a cylinder that is ≤ 0.50D from the refractive cylinder.
3. Case Examples
Example [ADDRESS_1148634] (spectacle) refraction:
O.D. -2.50D / -1.25D x 180° 20/20O.S. -2.00D / -1.00D x 180° 20/20
Choose a diagnostic lens for each eye with axis 180°. Place 
the lens on each eye and allow a minimum of 3 minutes for it to equilibrate, based on the patient’s initial response to the lens. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable.
Check the orientation of the axis mark. If the bottom axis mark 
is in the 6 o’clock position on both eyes, choose the appropriate cylinder as listed previously. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable.
Here is the Rx Prescribed:
O.D. -2.50D / -1.25D x 180°O.S. -2.00D / -0.75D x 180°
CR-6484, v 1.[ADDRESS_1148635] (spectacle) refraction:O.D. -3.00D / -1.00D x 90° 20/20O.S. -4.75D / -2.00D x 90° 20/20
Choose diagnostic lenses of -3.00D / -0.75D x 90° for the right 
eye and -4.50D / -1.75D x 90° for the left eye, the nearest lenses available to the spherical power, cylinder power, and axis needed. For the left eye, since the manifest refraction called for -4.75D, compensating for vertex distance the sphere is reduced by 0.25D to -4.50D. The cylinder power will be -1.75D. Place the lens on each eye and allow a minimum of 3 minutes for it to equilibrate, based on the patient's initial response to the lens. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable. 
Right Eye
The orientation mark on the right lens rotates left from the 6 
o’clock position by 10° and remains stable in this position. Compensation for this rotation should be done as follows: 
Compensate the 10° axis drift by [CONTACT_35565].
Here is the Rx Prescribed:
O.D. -3.00D / -0.75D x 100°
Left Eye
The orientation mark on the left lens rotates right from the 6 
o’clock position by 10° and remains stable in this position. 
Compensate for the 10° axis drift by [CONTACT_35566]. 
Here is the Rx Prescribed: 
O.S. -4.50D / -1.75D x 80°
If vision is acceptable, perform a slit lamp examination to assess 
adequate ﬁ  t (centration and movement). If ﬁ  t is acceptable, dispense the lenses instructing the patient to return in one week for reassessment (see dispensing and follow-up information in PATIENT MANAGEMENT).
All patients should be supplied with a copy of the PATIENT INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
CR-6484, v 1.[ADDRESS_1148636] adequately 
corrected distance and near visual acuity in each eye. The amblyopic patient or the patient with signiﬁ  cant astigmatism (greater than 1.00D) in one eye may not be a good candidate for monovision correction with these lenses.
Occupational and environmental visual demands should be 
considered. If the patient requires critical vision (visual acuity and stereopsis), it should be determined by [CONTACT_71190]. Monovision contact [CONTACT_35568]:
• visually demanding situations such as operating potentially 
dangerous machinery or performing other potentially hazardous 
activities; and
• driving automobiles (e.g., driving at night). Patients who cannot 
meet state driver's licensing requirements with monovision correction should be advised to not drive with this correction, OR may require that additional over-correction be prescribed.
2. Patient Education
All patients do not function equally well with monovision correc-tion. Patients may not perform as well for certain tasks with this correction as they have with spectacles (multifocal, bifocal, trifocal, readers, progressives). Each patient should understand that monovision, as well as other presby[CONTACT_35569], can create a vision compromise that may reduce visual acuity and depth perception for distance and near tasks. Therefore, caution should be exercised when the patient is wearing the correction for the ﬁ  rst time until they are familiar with the vision provided in visually chal-lenging environments (e.g., reading a menu in a dim restaurant, driving at night in rainy/foggy conditions, etc.). During the ﬁ  tting process, it is necessary for the patient to realize the disadvantages as well as the advantages of clear near vision and straight ahead and upward gaze that monovision contact [CONTACT_35570].
CR-6484, v 1.0  
 
Page 98 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
B. Eye Selection
1. Ocular Preference Determination Methods
Generally, the non-dominant eye is corrected for near vision. The 
following two methods for eye dominance can be used.
Method 1:  Determine which eye is the “sighting eye.” Have the 
patient point to an object at the far end of the room. 
Cover one eye. If the patient is still pointing directly at the object, the eye being used is the dominant (sighting) eye.
Method 2:  Determine which eye will accept the added power with 
the least reduction in vision. Place a hand-held trial lens equal to the spectacle near ADD in front of one eye and then the other while the distance refractive error correction is in place for both eyes. Determine whether the patient functions best with the near ADD lens over the right or left eye.
2. Other Eye Selection Methods
Other methods include the "Refractive Error Method" and the "Visual Demands Method."
Refractive Error MethodFor anisometropic correction, it is generally best to ﬁ  t the more 
hyperopic (less myopic) eye for distance and the more myopic (less hyperopic) eye for near.
Visual Demands Method
Consider the patient’s occupation during the eye selection process 
to determine the critical vision requirements. If a patient’s gaze for near tasks is usually in one direction, correct the eye on that side for near.
Example: A secretary who places copy to the left side of the desk 
will function best with the near lens on the left eye.
C. Special Fitting Characteristics
1. Unilateral Vision Correction
There are circumstances where only one contact [CONTACT_35571]. As an example, an emmetropic patient would only require a near lens, whereas a bilateral uld require corrective lenses on 
CR-6484, v 1.0  ( 
Page 99 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
both eyes.
Examples: A presby[CONTACT_35572] a +1.75D ADD 
would have a +1.75D lens on the near eye and the other eye left without correction. 
A presby[CONTACT_35573] a +1.50D ADD who is -2.50D 
myopic in the right eye and -1.50D myopic in the left eye may have the right eye corrected for distance and the left uncorrected for near.
2. Near ADD Determination
Always prescribe the lens power for the near eye that provides optimal near acuity at the midpoint of the patient’s habitual reading distance. However, when more than one power provides optimal reading performance, prescribe the least plus (most minus) of the powers.
3. Trial Lens Fitting
A trial ﬁ  tting is performed in the ofﬁ  ce to allow the patient to experience monovision correction. Lenses are ﬁ  t according to the GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES for base curve selection described in this Package Insert.
Case history and standard clinical evaluation procedure should 
be used to determine the prognosis. Determine the distance correction and the near correction. Next determine the near ADD. With trial lenses of the proper power in place, observe the reaction to this mode of correction.
Allow the lenses to settle for about [ADDRESS_1148637] the patient look at you. Assess the patient’s reaction to distance vision under these circumstances. Then have the patient look at familiar near objects such as a watch face or ﬁ  ngernails. Again assess the reaction. As the patient continues to look around the room at both near and distance objects, observe the reactions. Only after these vision tests are completed should the patient be asked to read print. Evaluate the patient’s reaction to large print (e.g., typewritten copy) at ﬁ  rst and then graduate to newsprint and ﬁ  nally smaller type sizes.
After the patient’s performance under the above conditions 
is completed, tests of  t and reading ability under 
CR-6484, v 1.0 ()  
 
Page [ADDRESS_1148638] several weeks of wear (when adaptation is occurring), it may be advisable for the patient to only drive during optimal driving conditions. After adaptation and success with these activities, the patient should be able to drive under other conditions with caution.
D. Other Suggestions
The success of the monovision technique may be further improved by [CONTACT_35574]:
• Have a third contact [CONTACT_13293] (distance power) to use when critical 
distance viewing is needed.
• Have a third contact [CONTACT_13293] (near power) to use when critical near 
viewing is needed.
• Having supplemental spectacles to wear over the monovision 
contact [CONTACT_35575]ﬁ  c visual tasks may improve the success of monovision correction. This is particularly applicable for those patients who cannot meet state driver's licensing requirements with monovision correction.
• Make use of proper when carrying out visual tasks.
CR-6484, v 1.0 ) 
 
Page 101 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Monovision ﬁ  tting success can be improved by [CONTACT_35576]:
• Reverse the distance and near eyes if a patient is having trouble 
adapting.
• Reﬁ  ne the lens powers if there is trouble with adaptation. 
Accurate lens power is critical for presby[CONTACT_35577].
• Emphasize the beneﬁ  ts of clear near vision and straight ahead 
and upward gaze with monovision.
The decision to ﬁ  t a patient with monovision correction is most appropriately left to the Eye Care Professional in conjunction with the patient after carefully considering the patient’s needs.

PATIENT MANAGEMENT
Dispensing Visit
Each sterile lens is supplied in a foil-sealed plastic package containing 
buffered saline solution with methyl ether cellulose. To remove the lens from the container, peel back the foil seal, place a ﬁ  nger on the lens, and slide the lens up the side of the bowl of the lens package until it is free of the container.
• Evaluate the physical ﬁ  t and visual acuity of the lens on each eye.
• Teach the patient how to apply and remove his or her lenses.
• Explain daily disposable lens wear and schedule a follow-up examination.
• Provide the patient with a copy of the PATIENT 
INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
REVIEW THESE INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE PATIENT SO THAT HE 
OR SHE CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS THE PRESCRIBED WEARING AND REPLACEMENT SCHEDULES.
Follow-Up Examinations
Follow-up care (necessary to ensure continued successful contact [CONTACT_13279]) should include routine periodic progress examinations, management of speciﬁ  c problems, if any, and a v  th the patient of the wear schedule, daily disposable modal a  p oper lens handling procedures. 
CR-6484, v 1.0 - (  
 
Page 102 of 170JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Recommended Follow-up Examination Schedule (complications 
and speciﬁ  c problems should be managed on an individual patient 
basis):
1. One week from the initial lens dispensing to patient
2. One month post-dispensing
3. Every three to six months thereafter 
NOTE: Preferably, at the follow-up visits, lenses should be worn for at least 
six hours.
Recommended Procedures for Follow-up Visits:
1. Solicit and record patient’s symptoms, if any.
2. Measure visual acuity monocularly and binocularly at distance and 
near with the contact [CONTACT_13276].
3. Perform an over-refraction at distance and near to check for residual 
refractive error.
4. With the biomicroscope, judge the lens ﬁ  tting characteristics (as 
described in the GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES) and evaluate 
the lens surface for deposits and damage.
5. Following lens removal, examine the cornea and conjunctiva with 
the biomicroscope and ﬂ  uorescein (unless contraindicated).
• The presence of vertical corneal striae in the posterior central 
cornea and/or corneal neovascularization is indicative of 
excessive corneal edema.
• The presence of corneal staining and/or limbal-conjunctival 
hyperemia can be indicative of an unclean lens, a reaction to solution preservatives, excessive lens wear and/or a poorly ﬁ  tting lens.
• Papi[INVESTIGATOR_35465]/or damaged lens.
6. Periodically perform keratometry and spectacle refractions. The 
values should be recorded and compared to the baseline meas-
urements.
If any observations are abnormal, use professional judgment to 
alleviate the problem and restore the eye to optimal conditions. If CR-6484, v 1.[ADDRESS_1148639]-0007 (13)

the criteria for successful ﬁ  t are not satisﬁ  ed during any follow-up 
examinations, repeat the patient’s trial ﬁ  tting procedure and reﬁ  t 
the patient.
WEARING SCHEDULE
The wearing schedule should be determined by [CONTACT_35578].   
Regular checkups, as determined by [CONTACT_35578], are also extremely important.
Patients tend to overwear the lenses initially. The Eye Care Professional 
should emphasize the importance of adhering to the initial maximum wear-ing schedule.  Maximum wearing time should be determined by [CONTACT_35579]’s physiological eye condition, because individual response to contact [CONTACT_35580].
The maximum suggested wearing time for these lenses is:

Basic Instructions
• Always wash, rinse, and dry hands before handling contact [CONTACT_13276].
• Do not use saliva or anything other than the recommended solutions 
for lubricating or rewetting lenses. Do not put lenses in the mouth.
• Eye Care Professionals may recommend a lubricating/rewetting solution which can be used to wet (lubricate) lenses while they are being worn to make them more comfortable. 
Care for a Sticking (Non-Moving) Lens
If the lens sticks (stops moving), the patient should be instructed to apply 
a few drops of the recommended lubricating or rewetting solution directly to the eye and wait until the lens begins to move freely on the eye before removing it. If non-movement of the lens continues after a few minutes, the patient should immediately consult the Eye Care Professional.
EMERGENCIES
The patient should be informed that if chemicals of any kind (household products, gardening solutions, laboratory chemicals, etc.) are splashed into the eyes, the patient should: FLUSH EYES IMMEDIATELY WITH TAP WATER AND IMMEDIATELY CONTACT [CONTACT_35581] A HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_35466].

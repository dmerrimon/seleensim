STUDY SYNOPSIS  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Date: January 30, 2023  
 
Title of Study: A Phase 1 ascending single-dose followed by [CONTACT_275474]-002 carbon monoxide liquid formulation  in healthy  adult volunteers. 
Protocol Number:  HBI-002-001 
Investigators/Study  Center : 
Phase  of Development : 1 
Objectives/Endpoints:  
Primary Objective/Endpoint: To assess the safety and tolerability of HBI -002, given as single 
ascending  doses (SAD)  and multiple  doses  (MD)  daily  for [ADDRESS_336299]. 
Secondary  Objectives/Endpoints:  
1. To evaluate  the pharmacokinetics (PK)  of HBI -002 with increasing  doses  of oral HBI-002 as 
measured by [CONTACT_275475].  
2. To determine  the HBI-002 dose required to achieve peak COHb  levels  up to 10% within  one 
hour after ingestion.  
3. To evaluate  any accumulation  of CO as measured  by [CONTACT_275476].  
4. To evaluate  biomarkers  of inflammation  and to assess changes induced by [CONTACT_275477]-002. 
Planned  Sample  Size:  
Up to 16 subjects will be enrolled in  the SAD phase (up to 4 dose cohorts) and 4 subjects in  the MD 
phase (one dose cohort). Additional subjects (up to 8 in the SAD phase and up to 6 in the MD phase) 
may be enrolled in any cohort, as needed, if incomplete data is obtained or there is a need to obtain 
additional safety observations. Subjects in the MD cohort will be replaced if all [ADDRESS_336300]  discontinues  the study  due to a related  adverse  event.  
Study  Duration:  Approximately  26 weeks  
Study  Design:  
This is a single center, open- label trial investigating up to four single ascending doses (SAD), 
followed by a single cohort of multiple doses (MD) with dosing daily for [ADDRESS_336301] signed the informed  consent  will undergo a screening  assessment  carried  out within 4  weeks of study 
entry consisting of a medical history, concomitant medications, physical examination, height and weight, vital signs, ECG, hematology and chemistry labs, infectious disease screen including SARS- 
CoV -2, hemoglobin electrophoresis, urinalysis, pregnancy and drug screen.  
Pregnancy testing  in females  of childbearing potential  will be carried  out in both the SAD and MD 
study components at screening and baseline, as well as in the SAD component at 48 hours and on 
Day 30, and in the MD component on Days 8 and 37. 
Concomitant medications and adverse events will continue to be monitored to the final follow up visit.  
Dosing  rules (SAD and MD)  
For the SAD study  component, there  will be at least [ADDRESS_336302] MD dose and the subsequent 3 subjects at  that dose level with no minimum time between 
dosing of the 3 subsequent subjects.  
All subjects (SAD and MD)  
Peak COHb measured by [CONTACT_3252] -oximeter will be monitored for safety, targeting levels of no more than 
10% COHb, and COHb saturation will be documented for each  subject at all  time points. The 
DSMB will  review  safety  information  through [ADDRESS_336303](s), that subject(s) will be discontinued and will 
immediately be administered oxygen.  If the protocol is put on hold for any reason, Hillhurst will 
communicate DSMB recommendations to FDA before resuming enrollment. 
Subjects  will not be replaced  if they discontinue  the study  due to an adverse  event  (AE).

Criteria  for Evaluation/Statistical  Methods:  
Pharmacokinetics : 
PK will be assessed in each subject based on whole blood COHb levels obtained at each designated 
blood draw. PK will be assessed on each subject in the SAD phase and on each subject in the MD 
phase with COHb.  In the MD phase, PK analysis will  be carried  out on both the first and final dose  
of HBI -002. Standard pharmacokinetic parameters for COHb incremental recovery [IR], maximum 
concentration following oral administration [Cmax], time to reach Cmax [Tmax], terminal or disposition half- life [t1/2], mean residence time [MRT], systemic clearan ce [Cl/F], area under the 
whole blood-time curve [AUC] and volume of distribution [Vd/F] after single oral administrations of HBI -[ADDRESS_336310] and mean concentration -time data will be graphically presented separately. If  sufficient data  are available  
across SAD dose cohorts, dose proportionality will be evaluated using a power model. 
PK analyses  will use the actual  observed  sample  drawing  times.  Samples  with unknown drawing 
time and/or where the concentration could not be determined will be eliminated from the 
calculations. Concentration  data will be carried  out in two modes: No correction for baseline value 
and corrected for baseline by [CONTACT_275481]-dosing value. 
PK parameters will be derived using noncompartmental methods with appropriate software. The 
following parameters  will be calculated  for each patient  separately:  AUC,  IR, Cmax,  AUCinf, Tmax, 
t
1/2, MRT, Clearance (CL/F) and Vd/F. These parameters will be summarized for each Dose Cohort 
separately by [CONTACT_74305] (number, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, 
median, coefficient of variation, geometric mean and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals as 
appropriate).  
 
Safety : 
All safety  data will be included  in the subject data  listings . Summary  tables will be based  upon the 
safety population. 
Serious and non-serious adverse events, occurring up to [ADDRESS_336311] one event  will be summarized  by [CONTACT_275482], for AEs considered to be possibly or probably related to the study 
drug, and for SAEs. The number and proportion of subjects experiencing these events will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_275483] p hase (SAD or MD). Related adverse events will be listed.  
HILLHURST  BIOPHARMACEUTICALS,  INC.  HBI-002-[ADDRESS_336312] deviation and range as appropriate.  
For the vital signs, transcutaneous  oxygen concentration, venous COHb and other  laboratory  safety 
data,  and ECG  data,  out of range  values  considered  to be clinically  significant will be  flagged  in the 
data listings and a separate listing of clinically significant abnormal values will be presented, 
including any COHb value >10%.

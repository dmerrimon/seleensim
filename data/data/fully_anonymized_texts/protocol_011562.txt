AAAR5220 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_92584] -Denosumab Bone Loss in Premenopausal Women with 
Idiopathic Osteoporosis  
[COMPANY_010] Reference Number: 20177429  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Study Protocol Version 1.0: December 6, 2017  
1. Study Purpose and Rationale
Osteoporosis in premenopausal women with normal me nstrual function and no specific cause is termed 
idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP). IOP is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of <200,[ADDRESS_92585] with major osteoporotic fractures1. High resolution peripheral 
quantitative computed tomography (HR -pQCT), central QCT, and microCT of iliac bone biopsies documented 
that, compared to [ADDRESS_92586] substantial microstruc tural deficits: thinner more 
porous cortices; fewer, thinner, more widely separated and heterogeneously distributed trabeculae; and 
markedly lower bone stiffness2-4.  To determine whether teriparatide (TPTD), an os teoanabolic drug that 
increases bone formation, improved bone microarchitecture and strength in premenopausal women with IOP, 
we conducted an open -label, 24 -month pi[INVESTIGATOR_84860], 20 µg daily, in 21 affected women. This study, 
published in 2013, reveal ed impressive gains in areal BMD (aBMD) by [CONTACT_11323] x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) 
at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (10.8 ± 6.4%), total hip (6.2  ± 5.7%) and femoral neck (7.6 ± 3.4%), and no significant change at 
the forearm5. Paired transiliac bone biopsies before and after TPTD revealed improved trabecular structure 
and a 71% increase in trabecular stiffness. Cortical thickness increased by 22% but cortical porosity also 
increased by 46%5. By [CONTACT_84888]-pQCT, trabecular structure and whole bone stiffness improved, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 17% 
increase in cortical porosity at the radius6. 
Most patients require antiresorptive ther apy to maintain TPTD -induced increases in BMD. However, several 
studies have shown that BMD remains stable after TPTD is discontinued in postmenopausal women on 
estrogen7-9 and in premenopausal women who regained n ormal menses after completing a course of nafarelin 
for endometriosis10. Based on these studies, we had previously hypothesized that the gains in BMD would be 
maintained in the IOP -TPTD pi[INVESTIGATOR_84861]. 
Therefore, we did not institut e sequential antiresorptive therapy. However, contrary to our hypothesis, in 2015, 
we reported that participants in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_84862] 4.8 ± 4.3% at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (p=0.0007), 
-1.1 ± 3.7% at the total hip and 1.5 ± 4.2 % at the femoral n eck over the 1 -2 years after TPTD discontinuation11. 
In 2016, w e completed  enroll ment of  41 premenopausal women with IOP into a randomized, 24 -month, FDA 
Orphan Diseases Program -funded trial, “A Phase 2 Study of Teriparatide for the Treatment of Idiopathic 
Osteoporosis in Premenopausal Women” (FD003902; PI, Shane). Based on the follow -up data from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480]11, we concluded that  participants in FD003902 would require antiresorptive treatment to prevent bone 
loss after completing TPTD. To assess this, we are currently enrolling women into AAAN0161, an open -label, 
24-36 month pi[INVESTIGATOR_84863] (Prolia®, 60mg SC every 6 months). Denosumab is a potent 
antiresorptive  drug that has been shown to increase BMD and reduce fracture incidence in postmenopausal 
women with osteoporosis . The denosumab study is also funded by [CONTACT_84889]  
(FD05114 ; PI, Shane). Only women who have completed FD003902 are eligib le to participate in FD [ZIP_CODE].  
We selected  denosumab because it is not retained in the skeleton and may thus be preferred by  [CONTACT_84890]. We hypothesize d that denosumab, initiated in women who 
complet e two years of TPTD  in FD003902 , would maintain or further increase central and peripheral areal and 
volumetric BMD, microstructure and stiffness in premenopausal women with IOP. We selected an open -label, 
observational design for FD [ZIP_CODE] because FD003902 enrolled 41 women and some may not choose to 
participate ; thus, power would be too low for a randomized, placebo -controlled design. The goals of the study 
are to estimate the effects of denosumab on central and peripheral, as well as trabecular and cortical, bone 
mass  and microstructure  and to obtain preliminary data to inform the design of a future randomized study.  
AAAR5220 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_92587] 12 months off 
therapy, all the bone density gained on treatment is lost12. Since we began enrolling subjects in FD [ZIP_CODE] 
(AAAN0161) , several  case reports and series have documented the occurrence of multiple vertebral fractures 
in some patients who have stopped denosumab14-20. Based upon these new fracture data,  [COMPANY_010] recently 
change d the Prolia label recommending that consideration should be given to transition to another 
antiresorptive drug in patients stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84864] . Therefore,  all participants in AAAN0161  will be invited to 
participate in an extension study after they complete AAAN0161 ( FD05114) .  
 
The primary goal of the study is to assess the extent to which bisphosphonate therapy will prevent 
decreases in bone mass that may occur after cessation of denosumab in premenopausal women with 
idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) enrolled in AAAN0161  (FD05114)  “Denosumab for the prevention of post -
teriparatide bone loss in premenopausal women with idiopathic osteoporosis”.   
 
For the bisphosphonates, we  have selected a lendronate 70 mg weekly because bone d ensity remained stable 
in 115 postmenopausal women who transitioned from denosumab to alendronate in  the Denosumab 
Adherence Preference Satisfaction (DAPS) study21. However, in the DAPS study, compliance and persis tence 
with alendronate was significantly lower than with denosumab  [ADDRESS_92588] denosumab dose and had BMD measured 18 -23 months later 22; this ti mepoint reflects a 
combination of response to bisphosphonate and duration of response, but does not distinguish between the 
two. How ever, this may be because bone turnover  would still have been very low  [ADDRESS_92589] also been low at the 
time of the zoledronic acid infusion. For this reason, we will delay the initiation of zoledronic acid (and 
alendronate) until 6 month s + 4 weeks (no later than 7 months) after the last denosumab injection . We 
selected the 6 month + 4 week time point based on Figure 4 of th e paper by [CONTACT_84891].  that indicated the bone 
resorption marker, C -telopeptide ( CTX) exceeded baseline by [ADDRESS_92590] dose12. 
 
The main goals of the new extension study  are to estimate rates of bone loss during one year of 
bisphosphonate therapy ( oral alendronate or intravenous zoledronic acid) initiat ed after completing 
denosumab. In addition, we will observe participants  for a second year off bisphosphonate therapy to assess 
duration of response. We hypothesize that bisphosphonate therapy with alendronate or zoledronic acid , 
initiated after recovery o f bone remodeling activity,  will prevent significant bone loss after discontinuing 
denosumab. However, should there be significant bone loss during the first year of bisphosphonate therapy, 
defined as greater than the Least Significant Change (LSC) at spin e or hip, and/or resulting in a T score < -
2.5), we would abrogate the proposed year of observation, and consider additional bisphosphonate therapy or 
reinstitution of denosumab , whichever we deemed most appropriate for the participant . Those who do not me et 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84865].  
 
 
The rationale  for conducting this study is as follows. The study is intended for premenopausal women  who 
have completed [ADDRESS_92591] responded well (BMD T or Z 
scores > -1.5 at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ) and for whom we could now consider a drug holiday because the risk of adverse 
effects of long -term antiresorptive therapy may be slightly higher after [ADDRESS_92592] , as well as on safety , specifically incident fractures and other adverse 
events . For those who remain at increased  risk for fracture (BM D T or Z scores < -1.5 at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793] /or hip 
after 2 years of Forteo and 2 to 3 years of Prolia, or fragility fractures during therapy), continuation of 
denosumab would also be an option.  
 
 
AAAR5220 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_92593]  dose of denosumab.  The transition from denosumab to 
bisphosphonate therapy will occur no later than 7 months after the participants’ last injection of denosumab.  
 
While a randomized controlled trial is the most rigorous design, and balancing the zoledroni c acid and alendronate 
group size  would be highly desirable, we do not believe that can achieve that without adversely impacting uptake 
of subjects from the parent study. Our experience indicates that many women in this age -group have specific 
concerns tha t influence their decision to take one or the other of the drugs. Some have relative contraindications to 
one or the other drug. We are concerned that if we require women to be randomized to  zoledronic acid or 
alendronate , a substantial proportion may decl ine to enroll and thus be at risk for rapid bone loss and perhaps 
fractures. We feel that providing young women of childbearing potential with the ability to select the intervention 
that fits best with their particular clinical situation will increase recr uitment and retention. In addition, the maximum 
number of women available to enroll in the extension study is 34. With only 17 subjects per group, power will likely 
be too low, even in a 1:[ADDRESS_92594] selected an open -label design for three reasons:   
1. The maximum number of women available to enroll in the  extension study is 34. With only 17 subjects per 
group, power will likely be too  low in a 1:[ADDRESS_92595] with 
their particular clinical situation will increase recruitment and retention.  
3. This design will enable us to acquire data on the personal factors and beliefs that determine the 
participants’ choice of intervention and will thus inform design of future studies involving young women wi th 
osteoporosis.   
Statistical Analysis Plan  
The main Specific Aim  and main Hypothesis of this study  are as follows:  
 
In premenopausal women with IOP who have first completed two years of TPTD in FD003902  followed by 24-
36 months of denosumab (Prolia®, 60mg SC every 6 months)  and then complete  [ADDRESS_92596] -bisphosphonate observation , to estimate : 
 
Aim 1 : The percent change from baseline (bisphosphonate initiation ) in areal BMD of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total 
hip, femoral neck and one -third radius  at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months  after bisphosphonate initiation . The primary 
outcome will be percent change in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_84866] 12 months. Exploratory outcomes  will 
be the percent change in total hip, femoral neck and 1/3 radius  areal BMD by [CONTACT_13613] 12 months  as well as 
BMD changes at all sites at other timepoints . 
 
Hypothesis 1: The gains in areal BMD by [CONTACT_84892] s pi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
total hip  and femoral neck during the 12 months of bisphosphonate therapy.  
 
In the same population of women, we will address three  Exploratory Specific Aims and one Safety Aim:  
1. Estimate t he percent change from baseline in total, cortical, and trabecular volumetric BMD, trabecular 
plate and rod microarchitecture, cortical porosity and stiffness of the distal radius and tibia by [CONTACT_84888] -pQCT 
and finite element analysis of HR -pQCT datasets  at 12 and 24 months . 
AAAR5220 Protocol Version 1.0  
 2. Estimate t he AUC and percent change in t he resorption marker,  C-telopeptide  from baseline ( at 6, 12, and 
18 and 24 months ), and associations between C-telopeptide at bisphosphonate initiation  and change in C -
telopeptide  after bisphosphonate initiation , and changes in areal and volumetric BMD, microarchitecture 
and stiffness.  
3. Estimate t he relationship between baseline and teriparatide -stimulated bone formation rate on the 
quadruple -labelled transiliac crest bone biopy ob tained during “A Phase 2 Study of Teriparatide for the 
Treatment of Idiopathic Osteoporosis in Premenopausal Women” (FD003902; PI, Shane) and change in  
BMD of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, femoral neck and one -third radius  after [ADDRESS_92597] -bisphosphonate observation . 
4. Delineate the  incidence of adverse event s, including vertebral and non-vertebral fractures , and epi [INVESTIGATOR_84867] . 
 
Expected Results:  After stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84864], it is well -established that bone remodeling increases and BMD 
by [CONTACT_84893]12,13. In addition, over the past two years, there have been several publications describing 
vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84864]  14-20. More rece ntly, it has been 
appreciated that there is a small but significant imbalance in the incidence of multiple vertebral fractures after 
discontinuation of denosumab  in a comparison between those completing denosumab versus those completing 
placebo.  One risk f actor for this outcome was the presence of vertebral fractures prior to therapy. This is of 
particular concern for women with IOP participating in AAAN0161  because a substantial proportion came  to 
medical attention because of multiple vertebral fractures. There are no published data on the effects of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84868], bone turnover and fractures in premenopausal women stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84864]. 
This study will be the first to examine the effect of alendronate or zoledronic acid during the first year of 
withdrawal from denosumab in premenopausal women.  Bone  density remained stable in 115 postmenopausal 
women who transitioned from denosumab to alendronate in the Denosumab Adherence Preference 
Satisfaction (DAPS) study 21. Zoledronic acid provided only partial protection from  bone loss in a case series of 
six women who received a single infusion [ADDRESS_92598] also been 
low at the time of the single zoledronic acid in fusion.  
 
Because we will delay the initiation of zoledronic acid (and alendronate) until 6 month + [ADDRESS_92599] that  both oral and IV  bisphosphonate therapy will prevent clinically significant bone loss ( defined as 
greater than the Least Significant Change (LSC ; see Section 3.C., 3.C.1 ) at spi[INVESTIGATOR_69648], and/or resulting in a T 
score < -2.5) during the first year after denosumab is stopped. Should there be significant bone loss during the 
first year of bisphosphonate therapy, defined as gre ater than the Least Significant Change (LSC) at spi[INVESTIGATOR_84869], and/or resulting in a T score < -2.5), we would discuss the findings with the participant and evaluate  
whether to  abrogat e the proposed year of observation . We would consider  additional bisphosp honate therapy 
or reinstitution of denosumab, whichever we deemed most appropriate for the participant  and was consistent 
with their wishes . Those who do not meet these  criteria would continue to the second year of observation off 
bisphosphonates.  
  
ANALYSIS PLAN  
Sample Size Considerations  
For th is Bisphosphonate Extension Study , given the number of women who have completed FD003902 and 
who have initiated  denosumab (n= 25) and the number who remain on FD003902 (n= 9), we anticipate that a 
maximum of 34 and a minimum of 30 women w ould enroll in the Bisphosphonate Extension Study .

AAAR5220 Protocol Version 1.0  
 POWER ANALYSIS  
 
For the Analysis, the primary analysis is the within -group analysis to assess whether there are d ifferences in 
primary and exploratory DXA  outcomes in bisphosphonate -treated patients at 12 and 24 months after 
cessation of denosumab (baseline).  We expect to have a sample size of [ADDRESS_92603] SD (4.30%) for change in spi[INVESTIGATOR_84871]11, and given a sample size of 30 subjects who stop denosumab  and take 
bisphospho nate therapy, a 3% margin  and a 4.30% SD, we will have 98% power  (the bisphosphonate within -
group analysis), to estimate the confidence interval for an absolute change in aBMD at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  (primary 
outcome) , total hip and femoral neck (exploratory outcome s) in women who discontinue  denosumab and take 
bisphosphonate therapy . 
 
 
STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
Given the non -randomized nature of this study, the primary objective will be to estimate the change in aBMD 
by [CONTACT_84897][INVESTIGATOR_050] (primary), total hip and femoral neck (exploratory) after cessation of denosumab 
treatment. The main analysis is the within -group difference analysis : A one -sample two -tailed T -test against 
the null hypothesis of no change will be used to assess whether bisphosphonate treated patients differ on DXA 
outcomes relative to the measurements acquired at the cessation of denosumab.  
 
3. Study Procedures  
 
3.A. Calcium and Vitamin D , Fractures  
All pa rticipants  under protocol AAAN0161  are currently receiving calcium and multivitamin supplements. 
Supplements will continue to be provided during the new study: a daily multivitamin that contains 400 IU of 
vitamin D and very little or no calcium and a calci um supplement (Citracal +D), which contains 315 mg calcium 
and 250 IU vitamin per caplet. They will be instructed to take 2 Citracal +D daily ( 630 mg calcium and 500 IU 
vitamin D in total). Thus their total vitamin D intake from supplements will be 900 IU daily.  
 
FRACTURES: We will capture all incident fractures by [CONTACT_84898]. Incident clinical and 
morphometric vertebral fractures will be ascertained by [CONTACT_84899][INVESTIGATOR_050] X -rays at baseline, 12 and 24 months. All 
subjects are instructed to notify their study team if they sustain a clinical vertebral fracture or a nonvertebral 
fracture. In addition, subjects will be specifically queried about incident fractures at each visit. All nonvertebral 
fractures will be verified by [CONTACT_84900].

3.C. Study Procedures  
 
3.1. BMD by [CONTACT_11324] : BMD (aBMD) of the LS (L1 -4), right proxi mal femur and non -dominant forearm will be 
measured on Hologic QDR Discovery densitometers (Hologic, Inc., Waltham, MA). At CUMC and Creighton, 
dedicated, licensed x -ray technicians with long -term research experience perform all scans. Phantoms are 
scanned daily to check for detector drift and the re sults are appended to a quality control (QC) database. 
Results are downloaded to specific project databases. QC procedures include circulation of phantoms 
biannually. At CUMC, precision is 0.86% for the LS  (LSC 2.4%) , 1.36% for the FN  (LSC 3.8%), and 0.70%  
(LSC 1.5%)  for the 1/3 radius. At Creighton, precision is 0.94% (LSC 2.6%) for the LS, 1.40% for the FN 3.9) 
and 1.62% (LSC 2.6%) for the 1/3 radius.  In terms of absolute BMD changes , the LSCs reported by [CONTACT_84902] 0.022 g/cm2 at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 0.027 g/cm2 at TH, 0.029 g/cm2 at the FN and 0.023 g/cm2 at the 1/3 radius . 
Radiation exposure for DXA of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hip and forearm with the Hologic Discovery machine is 7.45  µSv. 
  
3.2. Lateral (only) Spi[INVESTIGATOR_84872]:  Lateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_84873] t horacic spi[INVESTIGATOR_84874]5220 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_92605] ure is of such important in this particular group of patients.  Radiation exposure 
for thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_84875] 3 00 µSv and for lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_84875] 200 µSv.  
 
3.3. High Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR -pQCT) : HR-pQCT i s performed 
on the XtremeCT II (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland).  The nondominant distal radius and tibia are 
immobilized in a carbon fiber shell (158 -160).  The region of interest (ROI) is defined on a scout film by [CONTACT_84903] a reference line at the endplate of the radius or tibia; the first slice is 9.[ADDRESS_92606] slices is acquired 
at the distal end of both sites (68kVp effective energy, 900 µA cu rrent, 43 ms integration time) with a nominal 
isotropic resolution of 60.8 µm. This provides a 3D image of 10.2 mm in the axial direction. Attenuation data 
are converted to equivalent hydroxyapatite (HA) densities. The European Forearm Phantom is scanned 
regularly for quality control. Scans are manually scored for motion on a scale of 1 (no motion) to 5 (significant 
blurring of the periosteal surface, discontinuities in the cortical shell, or streaking in the soft tissue). Images 
with motion score of [ADDRESS_92607] of the forearm and leg, the estimated local average skin dose 
is 5 µSv per scan, and the effective whole body dose is below 5 µSv per scan, since only a very small fraction 
of the distal forearm or leg is irradiated.  
 
3.4. Biochemical and Hormonal Assays   
Safety: At each stu dy visit, f asting morning blood samples for basic metabolic panel, including serum calcium, 
will be collected and processed at a commercial labora tory (Quest Diagnostics, Teterboro , NJ).  
Mineral Metabolism and Bone Turnover: Fasting morning plasma/serum wi ll be collected at CUMC, and at 
Creighton. Specimens will be shipped frozen from Creighton University to CUMC, aliquoted and frozen at -80o 
for batch analysis in the Biomarker Core of the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (CUMC 
CTSA) , under the direction of Serge Cremers, PhD., PharmD. All assays are currently in place and inter - and 
intra-assay precision values are given in brackets after each test.  
PTH is measured by a well -established total intact PTH IRMA (Scantibodies Laboratory , Inc., Santee, CA; 
6.8%, 4.8%) , serum calcium by [CONTACT_84904] (Cobas Integra 400 Plus, [COMPANY_002] Diagnostics, Indianapolis,

6. RECRUITMENT  
Patients for the study will be recruited from those subjects who have completed FD003902 and at least one 
year of AAAN0161 . The Principal In vestigator s, [CONTACT_84920]  and [CONTACT_26021] , Co-investigators, [CONTACT_84921], and 
[CONTACT_84922], and Research Coordinators, [CONTACT_84923], [CONTACT_84924] -Kosseh and [CONTACT_84925], will be directly 
responsible for enrolling subjects and obtaining consent for the study. Permis sion will be first obtained from the 
patients' primary care physician, if appropriate. Written consent will always be obtained according to 
appropriate Informed Consent forms that will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_84908]. Each patient is counseled at the time of enrollment that all aspects of the study are 
separate from their management as a patient with osteoporosis.  They are assured that participation is entirely 
voluntary and that refusal to participate i n the study will not in any way influence their care. Statements to this 
effect will be included in all Informed Consent forms, which will be signed by [CONTACT_84909] a witness.  
 
 
7. INFORMED CONSEN T PROCESS  
Written consent will always be obtained according to appropriate Informed Consent forms that will be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_84910]. Potential 
participants are assured that partic ipation is voluntary and that refusal to participate will not influence their 
care.  Statements to this effect will be included in all Informed Consent forms, which will be signed by [CONTACT_84911]. All  investigators and coordinators have 
completed courses in Good Clinical Practices and HIPAA compliance. Written informed consent will be 
obtained for every subject by [CONTACT_84912], risks and benefits of the 
study . Confidentiality will be guarded with the use of computers that are password protected and storing 
questionnaires with sensitive information within a locked file. All subjects will be provided with instructions on 
how to contact [CONTACT_84913].  
 
AAAR5220 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_92610] will be ens ured. Personal Identifying Health Information (PHI) of 
participants will be kept only in secure files accessible to the PI, investigators and project coordinators. Data 
will be recorded on case report forms on which the only identifier is a research ID cod e. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_84877]. No names or identifying 
information will be included in research reports.  Subjects' names will not appear on questionnaires.  All 
computers housing resear ch data have passwords and timed screen savers requiring a password for access. 
Through these safeguards, the confidentiality of the data will be ensured.  
 
Information obtained in the setting in this study may be made available to the following entities:  
- The Sponsor -Principal Investigator , co-investigators, study staff and other health professionals who may be 
evaluating the study  
- Columbia University  
- [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307]  
- Authorized representatives of the Food and Drug Administr ation ('FDA'), the Office of Human  
Research Protections ('OHRP') or other government regulatory agencies

adequate protection of research participants, as requir ed by [CONTACT_17926].  
 
The Sponsor -Principal I nvestigator, regulatory authorities, and IRB may keep the research records indefinitely. 
If the results of the study are published or presented at a medical or scientific meeting, subjec ts will not be 
identified.  
 
9. PRIVACY PROTECTIONS  
 
We will take all necessary steps to safeguard each participant’s expectation that the information they offer will 
be held in confidence.  These protections will apply to all research related data collecti on and procedures, as 
well as to all forums  
 
Only a select group of study personnel will have access to patient study files.  We are fully committed to 
safeguarding an individual’s expectation that the information they offer will be held in confidence. All subjects 
will sign a HIPAA form in addition to the informed consent document to prevent inappropriate use or any 
disclosure of individuals' health information and to require any organizations which use health information to 
protect that information and the  systems which store, transmit, and process it. The subject has the right to 
revoke the authorization for us to access her health information at any time, as is stated in the HIPAA form that 
each subject will sign prior to participation.  
 
Our safety report ing responsibilities require the investigator to report any adverse events to the IRB, and the 
FDA. These reports will include only a study ID, and will not divulge the participant’s identity.  
 
10. POTENTIAL RISKS  
The risks of this study are related to th e venipuncture, radiation exposure and the study medication,  
alendronate/ zolendroic acid . 
 
Venipuncture:  The risks of venipuncture for blood drawing include pain, bleeding, bruising, and a remote 
possibility of infection or inflammation at the site. Addit ionally, there is a possible risk of syncope in individuals 
AAAR5220 Protocol Version 1.0  
 who are prone to vasovagal responses. To minimize these risks, trained phlebotomists who follow proper 
technique perform all venipunctures.  
 
Radiation:  Radiation exposure for DXA of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hi p and forearm with the Hologic Discovery machine is 
7.[ADDRESS_92611] abdominal/pelvic or chest CT scan is 7,[ADDRESS_92612] scan is associated with radiation exposure equivalent to approximately 15 -22 months of 
natural background radiation. We will counsel all study subjects about the total amount of radiation that they 
will receive as a result of participation as part of Informed Consent procedures of that particular study. In 
addition, they will be counseled that radiation exposure is cumulative throughout life and any additional 
exposure should be considered carefully.  
 
Placement of  an Intravenous Line for Zoledronic acid infusion:  Placing an IV may cause some redness, 
bruising, swelling, bleeding, discomfort or pain at the spot where the needle enters the body. Although rare, 
infection may also occur.  Some people may experience diz ziness, lightheadedness and/or fainting. The IV will 
be removed once the infusion has been completed.  
 
Zoledronic acid : Zoledronic acid  is contraindicated in individuals with hypocalcemia ; creatinine clear ance  
less than 35 mL/min and with evidence of  acute renal impairment ; and h ypersensitivity to any component of 
zoledronic acid. Participants with any of these characteristics will not be eligible to receive zoledronic acid.  
There are several p otential ris ks of zoledronic acid .  
Hypocalcemia  may worsen during treatment  so participants must be adequately supplemented with calcium 
and vitamin Renal impairment may develop , particularly in patients with underlying renal impairment or with 
other risk factors, su ch as advanced age or dehydration . For this reason the  dose will not exceed 5 mg and the 
duration of infusion will be  no less than 15 minutes . Creatinine clearance will be measured before the dose , 
which will be withheld if < 35 ml/min   
Osteonecrosis of t he Jaw  (ONJ)  has been reported. All participants  will have a routine oral exam by [CONTACT_84914] . 
Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_84878] . Patients with thigh or groin pain will be evaluated to rule out a 
femoral fracture  
If given du ring p regnancy , Zoledronic acid can cause fetal harm. All participants of childbearing potential will be 
advised  to use effective contraception for 12 months after the zoledronic acid infusion.  
Severe bone, joint, and muscle pain may occur  and there may be  a rise in body temperature (fever) in the [ADDRESS_92613] common adverse reactions to zoledronic acid (greater than 10%) are pyrexia, myalgia, headache,  
arthralgi a, pain in extremity fl ulike illness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and eye inflammation .  
 
Alendronate : Alendronate is contraindicated in individuals with abnormalities of the esophagus which delay 
emptying such as stricture or achalasia; inability to stand/sit upright for at least 30 minutes; at increased risk of 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] ; hypocalcemia ; hypersensitivity to any component . Participants w ith any of these characteristics will 
not be eligible to receive alendronate.  
AAAR5220 Protocol Version 1.0  
 Potential risks of alendronate include s evere irritation of upper gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa ; worsening of 
hypocalcemia ; bone, joint, muscle pain ; osteonecrosis of the jaw ; and  atypi[INVESTIGATOR_84879] . The most 
common adverse reactions (≥3%) are abdominal pain, acid regurgitation, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, 
musculoskeletal pain, and nausea.  
 
 
11. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
A Data & Safety Monitoring Board has been established for the parent TPTD study (FD003902) and the 
denosumab study will be invited to continue for the Bisphosphonate Extension Study to ensure continuity. 
The DSMB will monitor subject accrual, ethical conduct of research, as well as oversee adverse events and 
any unforeseen consequences in the study population. The DSMB is chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mishaela Rubin, an 
endocrinologist and Associate Professor of Medicine at CUMC with expertise in osteoporosis and clinical 
trials, [CONTACT_84926], an endocrinologist and Professor of Medicine at CUMC outside of the field of 
metabolic bone diseases (obesity and weight control), and a statistician, [CONTACT_84927] elia Bagiella, Professor of 
Health Evidence and Policy at Mount Sinai Medical School in [LOCATION_001] City. The DSMB is independent of 
all study personnel, and has signed a conflict of interest form to that effect. It meets annually face -to-face 
and by [CONTACT_84915]. The DSMB may recommend any 
steps necessary to protect the  participants.  
 
Interim Analysis: No efficacy interim analysis is planned. The proposed recruitment of a modest number of 
subjects, with the a nticipated recruitment schedule, diminishes the need for an interim efficacy analysis. 
However, this decision will be reviewed at the first meeting of the DSMB. If the DSMB decides  that an interim 
efficacy analysis is necessary , we will amend the protocol according to their decision.  
 
Stopp ing Rules: Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84880].  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84881], defined as greater than the Least 
Significant Change (LSC) at spi[INVESTIGATOR_69648], and/or resulting in a T score < -2.5). If this amou nt of bone loss is 
documented, we will albrogate the proposed year of observation, and consider additional bisphosphonate 
therapy or reinstitution of denosumab, whichever we deemed most appropriate for the participant. Those who 
do not meet stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84882].  
 
Protocol Modifications:  The IRB must review and approve any protocol amendment. Modifications wi ll not be 
undertaken without notification of the IRB, the DSMB , [COMPANY_010]  and the FDA. 
 
Reporting:  All adverse events will be reported according to the guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_84916]. We commit to follow the FDA re porting requirements set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 
21, Section 312.32, which is summarized below.  
 
 The sponsor shall notify FDA , [COMPANY_010]  and all participating investigators in a written IND safety report of  
(A) Any adverse experience as sociated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected; or  
(B) Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects including 
reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. Each notif ication shall be made as soon as possible 
and in no event later than [ADDRESS_92614]. Shane, the Sponsor/Principal Investigator , is in receipt  of 
the information. Each written notification may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A or in a narrative format and 
shall bear prominent identification of its contents . 
 
[CONTACT_84920], the Sponsor/ Principal Investigator, shall also notify the FDA and [COMPANY_010] by [CONTACT_84917] e-threatening experience associated with the use of the 
drug as soon as possible but in no event later than 7 calendar days  after the the Sponsor/Principal 
Investigator 's initial receipt of the information. Each telephone call or facsimile trans mission to FDA shall be 
transmitted to the FDA new drug review division in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the product 
AAAR5220 Protocol Version 1.0  
 review division in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research that has responsibility for review of the 
IND.                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 
The Sponsor/ Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_84883], if any, taken by 
[CONTACT_3016] a result of its continuing review and summary reports will be submitted annually to the FDA.  All 
adverse events that meet the criteria of Columbia University (CU) IRB’s reporting policy are reportable  to the 
IRB (link to policy is included below). The CU IRB requires reporting of all unanticipated problems considered 
to be unexpected, related or possibly related to participation in the research, and that suggest that the research 
places subjects or oth ers at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized.  The timeliness of 
this report will depend on whether the event is considered to be serious and whether it occurred at an internal 
or external site. Annual reports will be submitted to the IRB documenting all adverse events and unanticipated 
problems. Individual serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB and DSMB within [ADDRESS_92615]. Shane, the Sponsor/Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_84884].

12. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
The IOP subjects may or may not benefit directly from this study. If patients respond to the medication they 
receive, they will benefit by [CONTACT_84918], bone strength, and resistance to fractures.  
 
On a wider scale, the information gained from this research project may apply to all women who have 
idiopathic osteoporosis and may directly impact upon the future treatment of this puzzling disorder.  
 
13. ALTERNATIVES  
The alternative is not to participate in t his trial.  If a subject decides to withdraw, she will be counseled about 
other, alternative osteoporosis treatment options. Alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_31430], but are not limited to, 
Risendronate (Actonel)  and Ibandronate (Boniva).  
 
14. RESEARCH AT EXTERNAL SIT ES 
Research for this protocol will be conducted at Columbia University Medical Center in NY, NY and at Creighton 
University Medical Center in Omaha, NE. The research team at Creighton University will be responsible for 
securing IRB approval for all researc h activities conducted at their site related to this protocol.  We will maintain 
current versions of all IRB approvals and approved documents (ie – consent forms, etc) at our site and submit 
any changes promptly to the CUMC IRB.  Our plan for data and safe ty monitoring will include monitoring 
activities and outcomes at both study sites.  
 
15. COLUMBIA AS LEAD INSTITUTION  
Columbia University will be considered the lead institution in this protocol. There will be one other site, 
Creighton University. As stated  in the prior section, we will commit to the following:  1) obtain and maintain IRB 
approval at the Creighton site; 2) ensure that the Creighton site follows consent procedures and utilizes 
consent documents approved by [CONTACT_11577] (if the designated IRB is n ot the CU IRB, then the IRB -approved 
consent document must be similar to the CU IRB -approved consent document with regards the content and 
style of the document).  
 
Creighton University’s Federal -Wide Assurance # is FWA00001078.  
AAAR5220 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_92616] safety will be the 
responsibility of the DSMB , sponsor -principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_84885].  Adverse events and/or 
unanticipated problems will be re ported to the Columbia IRB in accordance with their policy , to [COMPANY_010] and to 
the FDA in accordance with their reporting guidelines (see Section 11.0 for more detailed information). Study 
compliance and assurance that the study is  conducted in accordance with the protocol will be facilitated by a 
protocol and operations manual developed by [CONTACT_093].  Participating research personnel will be 
instructed in proper forms completion and electronic data entry procedures, as it is  applicable to their study 
role.  Adherence with the study protocol and recruitment goals will be monitored by [CONTACT_456] -principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_84886], with monthly conference calls made to participating sites (Creighton 
University).   Upon identification of incomplete reports or missing data, this information will be obtained from the 
study site in writing.   
 
It is the responsibility of [CONTACT_84920], the sponsor -principal investigator , to submit all amendments  to the 
protocol , IND s afety reports and annual reports to [COMPANY_010] and to the FDA in compliance with the relevant 
institution’s policies for reporting. Amendments to the protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_84919] s, including, but not limited to, study 
questionnaires, procedures, and recruitment methods.  
 
Records and documentation pertaining to the protocol will be kept in the protocol regulatory binder and online 
through the Columbia RASCAL system.  Subject specif ic records will be stored in a password protected 
database or in a locked cabinet to ensure privacy and confidentiality, as is detailed in Sections 8.0 and 9.0. 
Data entry will be ongoing throughout the course of the protocol so that interval reports to th e investigator s, 
IRB, [COMPANY_010]  and other regulatory bodies are readily accessible.

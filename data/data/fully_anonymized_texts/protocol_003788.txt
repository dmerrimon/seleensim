Purpose of the Research 
 We are asking you to take part in a research study. This study will examine two groups for 
teaching repair of fourth-degree obstetrical lacerations.  One group will participate in a 
workshop using a modified beef tongue model which will illustrate anatomy and repair of a 
fourth-degree laceration, and the other group will watch a video using the modified beef 
tongue model to illustrate anatomy and repair of a fourth-degree laceration.  We are trying to 
evaluate differences in skill achievement in the two groups .  This study will enroll up to [ADDRESS_33862] attended a didactic session on fourth-degree laceration repair.   
Prior to randomization, you will take a short written pre-intervention knowledge assessment 
and be asked to rate your confidence level in completing a fourth-degree repair using a Likert 
scale.  You will also complete a baseline objective structured assessment of technical skills 
(OSATS) for repair of fourth-degree obstetric laceration on a commercial anatomical replica, the 
Sultan Anal Sphincter Trainer (Limbs & Things Inc, Savannah, Georgia).  The repair will be 
videotaped and then distributed to evaluators.  The time taken for the repair will be recorded.   
You will then be randomized into one of two groups.  The randomization will be performed 
usin
g a computer-generated block design so that each group has a balanced number of 
residents in each postgraduate year training level.  One group will be randomized to the 
modified beef tongue video and one will be randomized to the modified beef tongue 
instructional workshop.  The modified beef tongue video group will be given an instructional 
video we have created using the modified beef tongue model to show anatomy and proper 
repair of the laceration which you will be able to watch on a supplied computer.  The group 
randomized to the modified beef tongue instructional workshop will undergo an interactive 
Version 09/29/[ADDRESS_33863] again and the objective structured assessment of technical skills 
(OSATS) for repair of fourth-degree laceration on the commercial anatomical replica again.    
Participants will also be asked to evaluate model realism, ease of use, and satisfaction using a 
Likert scale.  The participants will be asked to assess their confidence again using a Likert scale.   
 
The participants will then be crossed over and those who were initially randomized to the video 
group will then undergo the instructional workshop and the ones initially in the workshop 
group will be given the instructional video.  Participants will then be asked to rate their overall 
preference between models on a scale of [ADDRESS_33864] (IRB) and others who are responsible for ensuring compliance with 
laws and regulations related to research.  The information from the research may be published 
for scientific purposes; however, your identity will not be given out.   Reponses will be recorded 
only by [CONTACT_34372].  Participates will not be identified in the video recordings and 
the video recordings will be saved on a secured server.  The videos will be deleted following 
final analysis.

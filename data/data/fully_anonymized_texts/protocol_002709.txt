Cancer   
– A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_134427] S-View  versus FFDM in the detection of breast canc er. Radiologist s’ 
performance metrics for the following modalities will be evaluated:  
1. Standard FFDM read on  the ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134428] (“ FFDM ”) 
2. Synthesized (S -View) read in conjunction with DBT read on the ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134429] (“ DBT plus S -View ”) 
This retrospective, multi -reader multi -case (MRMC) study will have an enriched 
sample of approximately 300 cases: 60 cancer cases and 240 non-cancer cases 
(including up to 48 biopsy proven benign  cases and 72 recall cases). Enrichment is 
with respect to pr oportions of cancer cases, biopsy benign cases, and recall cases.  
As its primary endpoint, this study is designed to evaluate whether the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) based on probability of 
malignancy (POM) scores and  requiring correct lesion localization is statistically 
significantly non -inferior for DBT  plus S -View  versus FFDM. Multiple secondary 
endpoints are outlined in the next section.    
STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 The safety and effectiveness of DBT  plus S -View  are both linked to the ability of 
radiologists interpreting DBT  plus S -View  images to accurately diagnose breast 
cancer. Each study endpoint therefore addresses both safety and effectiveness.  
All of the following endpoints are measured on the FFDM read, DBT  plus S -View  
read, and their difference. All measurements require correct lesion localization.  
The primary endpoint  is: 
 Non-inferior per -subject average area under the ROC curve (AUC) for 
DBT plus S -View  versus FFDM, based  on POM scores and requiring 
correct lesion localization  
The study will be considered to have successfully demonstrated safety and 
effectiveness of the Fujifilm ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134430] S -View  system if the per -
subject average AUC for DBT  plus S -View  is statistically significantly non -inferior 
to the average AUC for FFDM at the alpha = 0.05 significance level, for non -
inferiority margin delta = 0.05.  This will be established if the lower limit of the two -
sided 95% CI for the difference in average AUC for DBT plus S -View – FFDM lies 
entirely above –0.05.

metrics) and/or superior average AUC and/or other performance metric(s) 
for DBT plus S -View versus FFDM for subjects with dense breasts (BI -

study with an enriched sample of approximately 60 cancer cases and approximately 
240 non-cancer cases.  
1. Case Reference Standards  
 The reference standard for a cancer case is a case in which at least one 
lesion is confirmed as malignant by [CONTACT_134476].  
 The reference standard for a non -cancer case is biopsy or surgery for benign 
cases, or interpretation by [CONTACT_134490].  
1. The Truthing Process  
The truther will review all cancer cases selected for inclusion in the reader study.  
The truther will complete a n eCRF for each case, based on materials from the 
image acquisition site including mammograms. For each subject with at le ast one 
(1) biopsy proven malignant lesion, the truther will review the images and identify, 
confirm, and annotate lesions including the types of lesions visible within the

 2. The Reading Process  
Approximately 18 qualified radiologists will independently perform two reads on 
all (approximately 300) cases. E ach reader will read each case both as a FFDM  
read and a DBT plus S -View  read, all  on the ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134428].  Each 
reader will read half the cases on FFDM and the other half of the  cases on DBT 
plus S -View during one visit.  The reader will then read the complementary  FFDM 
and DBT plus S -View during the second  visit.  In order to minimize memory recall 
bias, the two reading visits will be separated by a memory washout period  of 
approximately four weeks.  
Interpretation instructions : The reader will complete the eCRFs for each case for 
the two reads. For each case on each read, the reader will first record whether 
there are mammographic  findings and an initial BI -RADS  assessment of 0, 1, or 
2. If the answer to this question is “no” the reader will be asked to confirm for this 
case: a BI -RADS assessment category of 1 or 2, a POM score following the POM 
guidance  provided in Table 4 , and recall decision of “no”. If the reader answers 
“yes” to whether there are mammographic  findings, the reader will be asked to 
confirm an initial BI -RADS assessment category of 0, and will then provide 
detailed informati on on each suspi[INVESTIGATOR_98868]  (up to three findings)  and the 
decision whether or not to recall the subject, as well as overall POM score and BI -
RADS assessment category . 
 
3. The Lesion Matching Process  
An expert not associated with diagnosing cases at the image -acquisition sites or 
serving as a reader interpreting images on this pi [INVESTIGATOR_134436] . This expert may be an expert mammography technologist with 
an active license or a board -certified radiologist who is  MQSA -qualified for both 
FFDM and tomosynthesis ; if a board -certified radiologist who is  MQSA -qualified 
for both FFDM and tomosynthesis , this expert may be the same person as the 
truther.  
 
STUDY ANALYSIS  All of the primary, secondary, and additional (optional) endpoints are measured on the 
FFDM read and DBT plus S-View  read, and their difference. All measurements require 
correct lesion localization.  
1.1. Analysis of primary endpoint   
The primary  endpoint on this study is per -subject AUC requiring correct lesion 
localization. We will estimate AUCs for each reader in each review condition 
(FFDM, DBT  plus S -View ) based on per -subject POM scores.  We plan to perform 
MRMC comparison of AUCs between FFD M and DBT plus S -View using the 
standard MRMC analysis of variance (ANOVA) method of Obuchowski and 
Rockette (1995)11 to ensure generalization of the study results both to the 
population of readers and the population of cases. Two -sided 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) will be used to quantify uncertainty in the within -modality estimates 
and the between -modalities difference.   
1.2. Analysis of secondary endpoint(s)  
Analysis of per -subject recall rates , specificity, and/or sensitivity  will use standard 
MRMC ANOVA methods.  Analysis of per -lesion sensitivity will use methods for 
clustered data from MRMC studies that take into account the correlation between

 lesions in the same case.  Subgroup analyses in non -cancer case types, lesion 
types, and/or  breast density cohorts will use similar methods.

March [ADDRESS_152403] cancer at some time in her life 
is about 1 in 8 (12%). The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimated that in [ADDRESS_152404] cancer and about 63,960 new cases of ductal 
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (the  earliest  form of breast cancer) would be diagnosed among 
women in the [LOCATION_002]. After lung cancer, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer 
death in women. The chance that breast cancer will be responsible for a woman's death is 
about 3%. ACS estimated th at in 2018, about 40,[ADDRESS_152405] been declining since about 1989, 
with larger decreases in women younger than 50. These decreases are believed to be the 
result of earlier detection through screening and increased awareness, as well as improved  
treatment. 1, 2 
At present, mammography (screen -film mammography and standard full -field digital 
mammography [FFDM] ) is the primary imaging modality used for early detection of clinically 
occult breast cancer. According to the [ADDRESS_152406] cancer of 14% for women aged 50 to 59 years and 
32% for women aged 60 to 69 years.3,4 In an analysis of the Swedish Mammography 
Screening in Young Women (SCRY) cohort, screening mammography was associated with 
a reduct ion in the relative risk for death due to breast cancer of 39% for women aged [ADDRESS_152407] limitation  is lesion masking: a true lesi on may not be visible on 
FFDM because it is masked by [CONTACT_134491]. The 
second limitation is lesion mimicry, which can occur when normal layers of tissue or isolated 
elements of calcium at different depths in the breas t are superimposed along the line of 
sight and combine on the 2D -projected image to resemble a lesion. The consequence is 
false -positive reports that require the unnecessary call back of subjects for further diagnostic 
workup examinations. The third limita tion addresses the inability to perceive the in -depth 
structure of a detected lesion and the surrounding tissue on FFDM. This information is 
particularly important for suggesting the presence of spi[INVESTIGATOR_134439]. For standard mammography, depth information can be obtained 
only in a very limited way by [CONTACT_134492] - and MLO -view images of the same breast.  
 
These limitations of FFDM may be significa ntly reduced through the use of digital breast 
tomosynthesis (DBT), which provides radiologists with in -depth views (through a series of 
cross -sectional views of DBT images) of the internal structure of the breast where each 
reconstructed image contains de pth information about breast structure and composition. In 
the DBT examination, each view (CC and MLO) of the breast is acquired as 2D and DBT 
images. The 2D and DBT images are presented for the radiologist’s interpretation on a pair 
of FDA -cleared five -megapi[INVESTIGATOR_8070], grayscale display monitors (see Appendix A).

 Synthesized view (S -View) images are used in the same way that 2D FFDM images are 
used as part of a 3D study, and are generally never viewed independently for screening or 
diagnosis. S -View images are  created from a software reconstruction algorithm, allowing for 
reduction in radiation dose, since 2D images do not need to be acquired. S -View images 
can be acquired in any projection and have been shown to be capable of replacing 2D 
FFDM imaging in a 2D/ 3D combination exam. S-View images can be used when comparing 
to FFDM images, with the diagnosis and BI -RADS assessment made based on the 
combination of the S -View and tomosynthesis images. S -View images are also useful in 
detecting left/right asymmetry as  well as in assessing the distributional aspects of 
calcification. If there is a finding in a synthesized image, it will be confirmed with the 
tomosynthesis images.  
 
FFDM with DBT is being replaced by [CONTACT_134493] 2D mammography with DBT in breast 
imag ing to reduce radiation dose while maintaining screening outcomes. Recent clinical 
trials supporting the Selenia Dimensions 3D System (with C -View Module) - PMA 
Supplement: P080003/S001 , and t he SenoClaire Digital Breast Tomosynthesis System (with 
V-Preview) – PMA Supplement P130020/S001 , demonstrated 3D digital mammography 
images suitable to be used in the screening  and diagnosis of breast cancer  as well as  the 
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of DBT plus synthesized 2D 
technology.16,[ADDRESS_152408] s’ 
performance metrics for the following modalities will be evaluated:  
 FFDM read on the ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134428] (“FFDM”)  
 Synthesized (S -View) read in conjunction with DBT on the ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134440] (“DBT  plus S -View ”) 
This retrospective, multi -reader multi -case (MRMC) study will have an enriched sample of 
approximately 300 cases:  60 cancer cases and 240 non-cancer cases (including up to 48 
biopsy proven benign  cases and 72 recall cases).  Enrichment is with respect to proportions 
of cancer cases, biopsy benign cases, and  recall  cases.  
As its primary endpoint, this study is designed to evaluate whether  the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve (AUC) based on probability of malignancy 
(POM ) scores and requiring correct lesion localization is statistically significantly non-inferior 
for DBT  plus S -View  versus FFDM . Among its secondary endpoints, the study is designed to 
evaluate : 
1. Non-inferior and/or superior (lower) per -subject average recall rate for all non -cancer 
cases for DBT plus S -View versus FFDM, based on recall scores, using non -
inferiority margin delta = 0. 05.

the Fujifilm ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134441] S -View  system if the per-subject average AUC for 
DBT plus S -View  is statistically significantly non-inferior  to the average AU C for FFDM  at the

A minimum of 300 cases ( 60 cancer cases and 240 non-cancer cases) will be selected from 
mammograms that were acquired during Fuji film protocol FMSU201 3-004A.  
Images to be used in this study were acquired at image -acquisition sites  listed in Table 1 . 
The sites participated in protocol FMSU201 3-004A and acquired images of subjects who 
consented to participate in that s tudy. As part of the consent process, subjects agreed that 
image data and supporting docum entation could be used for future research and 
investigations.

7.4 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
The probable benefits of the device are based on the data that will be collected  in the clinical  
study being conducted to support PMA supplement approval.  
 
The ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134447]. It is likely to benefit a substantial number of screening patients whose cancers 
could have o therwise been missed due to tissue superimposition (false negatives), or who 
may otherwise have been unnecessarily referred for additional workup (false positive).  
 
Synthesized view (S-View) images are created from the reconstructed DBT images. Without 
the need of additional radiation exposure to the patient, the S -View image is generated by 
“combining” the DBT images of that view into a single 2D synthetic mammography image.   
 
The device has no significant risk of direct harm to the patient.  
 
The primary risk of the device comes from the possibility of false positive and false negative

 clinical decisions when using the images produced by [CONTACT_134482][INVESTIGATOR_134448]. 
Fujifilm has  designed an MRMC study to compare the performance of readers with FFDM 
alone and with DBT plus S-View . The study design is consistent with other mammography 
studies. Because MRMC studies are conducted outside the clinical setting, with an enriched 
case se t, and without patient history, the generalizability of some figures of merit such as 
recall rate, sensitivity, and specificity is limited. The design is considered acceptable in order 
to reduce the size of the trial and avoid confounders.

associated with the diagnosing of cases at the image -acquisition sites ( under Fujifilm  
protocol FMSU2013 -004A ), will not be associated with the reading of images in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_134450], and will be available to perform th e responsibilities as the study truther and 
conduct the truthing process . 
Base qualification c riteria : The base criteria for the truther are as follows:  
 Board -certified radiologist.  
 MQSA -qualified in tomosynthesis   
 Experience reading FFDM images  on a monitor (softcopy) . 
 Experience reading DBT images on a monitor (softcopy).  
In addition, to merit the designation “expert in breast imaging,” the radiologist selected to be 
the study truther must meet one or more  of the following criteria:  
 Have instru cted breast imaging in a professional society meeting.   
 Have authored textbooks, book chapters, or peer -reviewed journal articles  in 
mammography . 
 Have interpreted  mammography for at least 10 years.  
Training : The truther will participate in a training sess ion to ensure understanding of the 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134428] , reading DBT  plus S -View  images, the protocol, the eCRFs, 
study processes, GCP, and the obligations entailed by [CONTACT_28224]. Particular 
attention will be given to reviewing the annotation process.

8.3.3  Workflow for the Truthing Process  
The truther will review all cancer cases  selected for inclusion in the reader study.  The 
truther will complete a n eCRF for each case , based on materials from the image acquisition  
site including mammograms.   For each cancer case  the truther will review the images and 
identify, confirm, and annotate (including the lesion  locations  and slice , if applicable ) for 
each malignant lesion:  
 The type of lesion visible within the mamm ogram (mass, microcalcifications  
asymmetric densi ty and/or focal asymmetry)  
 The breast, view, and if possible the coordinates and slice, if applicable,  in which 
each le sion is located  
 Document the characteristics of the lesion on the eCRF

This study will be conducted with radiologists of varying experience levels, from both 
community and academic practices; some of whom will have had no experience reading 
synthesized (S-View)  imag es. These radiologists will not be associated with the acquisition 
or review of cases and did not participate in the truthing process. A survey questionnaire wi ll 
be sent to prospective r eaders to determine the fraction of their professional time devoted t o

 10. The Reading Process  
10.1 Purpose  
The purpose o f the reading process is for the readers to  provide the BI -RADS assessment 
categories, probability of malignancy ( POM ) scores, recall scores, locations and types of any  
finding(s)  on the eCRFs for their interpretation of the study cases; with FFDM images  and 
DBT plus S -View  images on the ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134428] . 
10.[ADDRESS_152418] processing 
capabi lities (e.g., magnification, windowing and leveling) will be permitted. Hotkeys will be 
provided on the workstations for consistency and accuracy of the reading process.  The 
reading time allowed per case will not be limited. A  lunch  break will be offered during each 
reading session, and radiologists will be encouraged to take a [ADDRESS_152419] that it preclude d 
identification of any image acquisition centers ’ or study radiologists ’ performance .

March [ADDRESS_152420] and image 
acquisition interpretations (under protocol FMSU2013 -004A ) for each case. Readers will not 
have access to prior mammograms or other clinical information. All readers will perform their 
interpretations independently.  
 
Each study reader will be randomly assigned to a unique reading order . All study readers 
will ultimately interpret all study cases  in both FFDM, and DBT plus S -View  formats . 
Readers will interpret the preloaded mammograms in their assigned order  with the use of 
barcode scanner/barcodes .  
General instructions  for the readers are as follows:  
 Do not record single punctuate or round calcifications and vascular calcifications, 
given the high prevalence of these benign findings and their low probability of 
cancer.  
 Consider all views available from both breasts to determine if you would recall the 
case.  
 For examinations with multiple findings, record the types and locations of all findings 
in the eCRF and/or a breast schematic diagram that divi des each breast image into 
sections and image slice for DBT images . Record the finding locations beginning 
with the most suspi[INVESTIGATOR_134453]  (up to three lesions per case) . 
 Provide a BI -RADS assessment category of 1 through 5 for each annotated finding.  
 Provide a probability of malignancy ( POM ) for each annotated finding according to 
the guidance listed in Table 4 (below).   
Probability of Malignancy (POM) : POM is a 0 to 100  score  assigned by [CONTACT_134498][INVESTIGATOR_98868] , as their perception of the percentage chance that the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_134454]. To help the assignment of POM scores readers will be instructed to use 
the entire POM scale, with descriptions of POM values provided in Table 4 only as 
guidance : 
Note : POM scores will be determined and analyzed separately from the BI-RADS 
assessment category .

Interpretation instructions  for the readers are as follows:  
The reader will complete the eCRFs  for each case for the two reads. For each case on each 
read, the reader will first record whether there are mammographic findings. If the answer to 
this question is “no” the reader will be asked to confirm for this case: a BI -RADS assessment 
category of 1  or 2, a POM score following the POM guidance  provided in Table 4 , and recall 
decision of “no”. If the reader answers “yes” to whether there are mammographic findings, 
the reader will be asked to confirm an initial BI -RADS assessment category of 0, and will 
then provide detailed information on each suspi[INVESTIGATOR_98868]:  
 Affected breast (right or left)  
 Type (includes mass, asymmetry, and/or architectural distortion), microcalcifications, 
or mass with microcalcifications, or other  
 “Forced” BI -RADS assessment category 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5  
 POM score 0 through 100  
 The reader will then be asked whether the case shall be recalled (“yes” or “no”), their 
forced BI -RADS assessment category (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5), and POM score [ADDRESS_152421]’s results on  the eCRFs to 
ensure completeness.   
In cases with mammographic findings, consistency of POM scores with BI-RADS 
assessment categories  and recall decisions will not be forced – i.e. readers will be permitted 
to use the full range of POM scores for a finding (following the POM guidance  provided in 
Table 4 ) no matter what BI -RADS assessment category  they assign to it . 
 
10.2.4  Reading Sessions with a Memory Washout Period  
Each reader will read each case both as a FFDM read and a DBT plus S -View  read, on the 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134428].  Each reader will read half th e cases on FFDM and the other 
half of the cases on DBT plus S -View  during one visit.  The reader will then read the 
complementary  FFDM and DBT plus S -View  during the second visit.   In order to minimize 
memory recall bias, the two reading visits will be sep arated by a memory washout period  of 
approximately four weeks .

Reading Session Order  
a. The selected cases will be randomly allocated into four (4) sets of [ADDRESS_152422] ( cancer, benign, recall, and normal ), and to the extent 
possible in the case sample, on presence of calcifications, breast composition 
(fatty or dense), and image acquisition site.  
b. Each study reader will be rando mly assigned to a unique reading order . 
c. Each session has 300  cases that will be read: 150 FFDM cases and 150 DBT 
plus S -View cases for the two read visits.

Interpretation Results: For each case, the readers are asked to provide two sets of results 
from two reading visits separated by a memory washout period. Each reader will read half 
the cases on FFDM and the other half of the cases on DBT plus S -View  during the first  visit.

March [ADDRESS_152423] that is  MQSA -qualified  for both FFDM 
and tomosynthesis ; if the latter, this expert radiologist may be the same person as the 
truther.  
Base qualification criteria : The base criteria for the lesion matcher are as follows:  
 Has an active license as a breast mammogram technologist  
 Has experience with clinical rese arch in the GCP environment  
 Or, Study t ruther (refer to truther qual ifications in  section 8.2 )   
 
Training : The lesion matcher will participate in a training session to ensure understanding of 
the ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134428], the protocol, the eCRFs, study processes, GCP, and the 
obligations entailed by [CONTACT_28224]. Particular attention will be given to the lesion 
matching process.  
11.[ADDRESS_152424] remotely, with results documented within the truther/lesion 
matching database.  
11.3.[ADDRESS_152425] access to both the reader’s eCRF and the truther’s eCRF. The 
eCRF and images  contain the annotat ed information, such as Subject  ID number, the 
finding location(s), and finding type(s) which are required for the determination of correct 
lesion localization. The matching is limited to cases  with malignant  lesions. For eac h case  
with cancer, the lesion matcher determines if the annotation by [CONTACT_134499].  
 
11.3.3  Workflow for the Lesion Matching Process  
The lesion matching process is limited to th ose cases with malignant lesions . Based on the 
case ID number on the truther’s eCRF, the lesion matcher identifies the reader’s eCRF with 
the same  Subject  ID number. The lesion matcher compares  the finding location(s) and 
finding type(s) of the reader’s eCRF and annotated images  to those  of the truther’s eCRF, to 
FUJIFILM Medical Systems U .S.A., Inc.  Protocol FMSU2017 -002B  
  
 
March [ADDRESS_152426] lesion localization. The process will be repeated for 
each reader’s eCRFs that have the corresponding Reader Sequence  ID number to truther’s 
eCRFs, and for every reader.  The lesion matche r will record the lesion matching results on 
the eCRFs.  
 For each truther’s eCRF, identify and confirm the reader’s eCRF that contains the 
corresponding Subject ID number and Reader Sequence ID Number  
 Identify and match the location (breast, view, and if p ossible the section and/or slice ) 
and type of finding(s) with those of the truther’s eCRF 
 Document the matching results on the eCRF 
Note 1: To allow for the possibility of lesions located on breast section boundaries, the 
reader will get credit for correct ly locating a lesion if the matcher determines that the 
annotations match even if an adjacent quadrant is recorded on the case report form. In this 
situation, we anticipate x/y coordinates to be within 2 centimeters  and slice numbers to be 
within 10 slices.  Readers will not get credit for correctly locating a lesion if the matcher 
determines that the annotations do not match, even if the same quadrant is recorded on the 
case report form; in this situation the x/y coordinates and/or slice numbers also usually 
would not match with the pre -specified tolerance. The lesion matching process will be 
supported by [CONTACT_134500] (computer) determination of whether x and y coordinates are 
within 2 centimeters ; and whether slice numbers are within [ADDRESS_152427] udy. The statistician will not be blinded 
to the review setup , because slice numbers apply only to DBT plus S -View . 
Baseline descriptive summaries will include the distribution of demographic characteristics and 
type of cancer (soft tissue lesion [ mass , asymmetry, architectural distortion, other] , 
microcalcification, or soft tissue lesion  with microcalcification), lesion size, breast composition 
(BI-RADS breast composition categories) and reference standard status (cancer, benign , recall , 
or normal) . We wil l also provide summaries across readers of the per -subject number of 
findings, BI-RADS scores , POM scores, and per -subject recall scores, for the FFDM and DBT 
plus S-View  workstation image reviews. These may be cross -classified by, for example , 
presence of malignant lesions. Categorical variables (such as cancer type and breast tissue 
composition) will generally be summarized using frequencies and proportions or percentages,  
while continuous variables will generally be summarized using means an d standard deviations  
(SDs) , or medians and quartiles or ranges. Missing values will generally be reported as such in 
these descriptive summaries.  
12.1 Analysis S et 
Intent -to-Diagnose Population  The intent -to-diagnose population comprises each reader’s 
interpretation of each study case in each modality  (FFDM, DBT plus S -View). Missing 
interpretations are not anticipated. We plan to include all readers’ interpretations of all cases in 
both modalit ies in the analysis set. If any protocol deviations or violations occur , the statistician 
will evaluate the m to determine their impact on the integrity  of the study data base ; and will 
determine whether any affected data points should be excluded from prima ry analysis.  
 
12.2 Multiple C enters (pooling)  
Fujifilm  has obtained  images from multiple centers. The protocol for data submission, quality 
review passed by [CONTACT_134501], and reference standard status determination for all images used in 
the MRMC study will be co mmon. Cases will be pooled across enrolling centers for interpretation 
on the MRMC study using common interpretation protocol and electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs), and results of interpretation sessions will be monitored. The scoring of (lesion matching 
for) reader interpretations will follow a common process. Results for any particular reader will 
therefore be pooled across enrolling centers.  
12.[ADDRESS_152428] scoring: POM and BI -RADS  
The primary endpoint is per -subject  AUC based on POM scores  requiring correct lesion 
localization . Secondary endpoints include per -subject  sensitivity and specificity based on BI -
RADS categories.  When computing sensitivity and specificity based on BI -RADS, a score of 
[ADDRESS_152429] analyses will be derived by [CONTACT_134502] 6: 
 If a case has no proven malignancies:  
 If the reader does not record any findings in this case: The POM score for this 
case will be the same as the POM score recorded by [CONTACT_134503], 
and the BI-RADS score  for this case will be the same as the BI-RADS 
assessment category  recorded by [CONTACT_134503].  
 If the reader records any findings in this case: The overall  POM score 
recorded by [CONTACT_134503] , and the overall BI-RADS category 
recorded by [CONTACT_134504] , after describing those 
findings.  
 If a case has one or more proven malignancies:  
 If the reader records one or more findings that are determined by [CONTACT_134505](s) of any proven malignancies in this case: The 
maximum of the POM scores recorded by [CONTACT_134506] t hose findings will be 
assigned to the case, and the BI -RADS category for the case will be assigned 
as the maximum of the BI -RADS categories recorded by [CONTACT_134507].  
 If the case contains more than one malignant lesion, the reader will 
get credit for identifying the case as having one or more proven 
malignancies even if the reader does not identify all of the proven 
malignancies in the case. For example in a bilateral case, the reader 
would get credit for identifying the case even if the rea der marks 
findings in only one breast.  
 If the reader does not record any findings in this case; or when the reader 
records findings in this case, but none of them are determined by [CONTACT_134508](s) of any proven malignancies:  
 If the reader did not record any findings in the case, the POM score 
for this case will be the same as the POM score recorded by [CONTACT_134509]-RADS score  for this case will be the 
same as the BI-RADS assessment category  recorded by [CONTACT_134510]  
 If the reader recorded one or more findings in this case, but none of 
them are determined by [CONTACT_134511](s) of 
any proven malignancies, a POM score of the higher of 0 or, for  
readers who do not assign POM 0 to  any case in a reading

for this case will be assigned as category 1 . 
 The POM scores and BI -RADS categories for any reader findings i n this case 
that do not match the location(s) of any proven malignancies will be ignored 
in the per -subject analysis, which requires a single POM score and single 
BI-RADS category per subject conditional on whether the subject does or 
does not have proven malignancies.

  A false negative (FN) occur s when a case  contains one or more cancerous lesions, and 
the per -subject BI-RADS score  is 1, 2, or 3. This happens when either: 1) the reader 
does not mark any findings that match the location of one or more cancerous lesions, or 
2) the reader marks one o r more findings, at least one of those findings matches the 
location of one or more cancerous lesions, but none of the scores assigned to those

cancer. Sensitivity will be analyzed in subjects with cancer overall, and may be analyzed in 
further subgroups defined by [CONTACT_134525] (for example, masses, calcifications) . Recall rate also 
will be analyzed in the subgroup of subjects with cancer.  
Analysis of per -subject specificity is limited to the subgroups of subjects without cancer. Recall 
rate also will be analyzed in the subgroups of subjects without cancer, and may be analyzed in 
the subset of recall cases. If analysis is performed in the subset of recall cases, complementary 
analysis will be performed in the subset of normal cases and in the subset of benign cases.  
Performance metrics (AUC, sensitivity, specificity,  and/or recall rate) also may be analyzed in 
the subgroup of women with dense breasts (BI -RADS breast composition categories c. The 
breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses and d. The breasts are 
extremely dense, which lowers the s ensitivity of mammography).  If analysis is performed in the

Primary analysis will not involve pooling across study radiologists, to allow for heterogeneity  
among them. We will estimate AUCs for each reader in each review condition ( FFDM, DBT plus

require correct lesion localization, such that in a subject  with cancer i f the reader recorded one 
or more findings in the case but no findings are determined by [CONTACT_134526](s) of any proven malignancies, a POM score of [ADDRESS_152436] . 
We will provide graphs  of each reader’s ROC cu rve for each review condition , and an

established if the lower limit of the two -sided  95% CI for the difference in averag e AUC for 
DBT plus S -View  – FFDM lies entirely above –0.05.

Analys is of per -subject recall rates for all non -cancer cases will be performed using 
standard MRMC analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods described in Obuchowski 
and Rockette (1995) .[ADDRESS_152439] average recall rate for DBT plus S -View  versus FFDM for all

 6. Superior (lower) per -subject average recall rate for DBT plus S -View  versus FFDM 
for all recall cases  (follow -up proven non -cancer  cases)  
Analysis of per -subject recall rate for all recall cases will be performed similarly to 
analysis of per -subject recall rates for all non -cancer cases . If analysis is performed 
in the subset of recall cases, complementary analysis will be performed in the subset 
of normal cases and in the subset of benign cases.  
7. Non-inferior per -lesion average sensitivity for masses, masses with calcifications, 
focal asymmetries, and/or architectural distortions for DBT plus S -View  versus 
FFDM, based on BI-RADS scores  requiring correct lesion localization, using non -
inferiority margin delta = 0.10  
We plan to use methods for clustered data from MRMC studies that take into 
account the correlation between lesions in the same case  when analyzing 
lesion -level sensitivity . In particular, Rao and Scott’s (1992)14 method for estimating 
proportions from clustered data will be used to obtain estimates for each reader in 
each reading condition, and Obuchowski’s  (1998)12 extension of this to a pair of 
correlated proportions will be used to estimate the variance -covariance matrix of all 
possible pairs of proportions. The usual Obuchowski and Rockette (1995)11 MRMC  
method will then be applied to perform inferences that gener alize to the population of 
readers and the population of cases while also taking into account within -case 
correlations between lesions.  
8. Non-inferior and/or superior per-lesion average sensitivity for calcifications and/or 
masses with calcifications for DBT plus S -View  versus FFDM, based on BI-RADS 
scores  requiring correct lesion localization, using non -inferiority margin delta = 0.10  
Analysis of per-lesion sensitivity for calcifications and/or masses with calcifications  
will be performed similarly to analysis of per-lesion sensitivity for masses, masses 
with calcifications, focal asymmetries, and/or architectural distortions . 
9. Non-inferior (margin delta = 0.05 for AUC, 0.10 for other performance metrics) and/or 
superior average AUC and/or other performance metric(s) for DBT plus S -View  
versus FFDM for subjects with dense breasts (BI -RADS breast composition 
categories c. The breasts are heterogeneously  dense, which may obscure small 
masses  and d. The breasts are extremely d ense, which lowers the sensitivity of 
mammography ). 
Analysis will performed similarly to corresponding analysis above.  If analysis is 
performed in the subset of women with dense breasts, complementary analysis will 
be performed in the subset of women with non-dense breasts.  
 
 
Multiple Comparisons.  We will use a graphical approach to illustrate relationships among 
endpoints and protect the study’s type 1 error rate from inflation .13,17 The testing strategy is 
shown in a figure with vertices (nodes) for each hypothesis to be tested and directed paths 
(arrows) between vertices. All study hypotheses to be formally tested as potential marketing 
claims are shown in the graph. Hypotheses are denoted H 1, H2, …, H k, …, H m, where m is 
the total number of hypotheses to be tested. Each hypothesis to be tested is allocated initial 
endpoint -specific alpha, k, and the sum 1 + 2 + … + k + … + m =  for the study overall, 
0.05. Initial endpoint -specific alpha can be 0 for endpoints of lesser importance; hypotheses 
for these endpoints will receive alpha from hypotheses that are rejected and direct alpha 
toward them.

Each directed path is assigned a weight between 0 and 1 indicating how much of the 
endpoint -specific alpha moves along the path when a hypothesis is rejected. The sum of 
weights leaving any hypothesis equal to 1, that is, all of the preserved alpha is used in 
receiving hypotheses. Paths may include a loop -back feature whereby [CONTACT_134527] a pair of 
loopi[INVESTIGATOR_134457] -specific k, that k loops back to the other 
hypothesis to increase its endpoint -specific alpha. Testing in a strategy with loop -back can 
start with any vertex that has initial endpoint -specific k > 0, and all such vertices can be 
tested until one is found for which the null hypothesis is rejected; then testing follows the 
arrows.  Finally, conditional passing of alpha is shown by [CONTACT_134528] (); this places higher prior ity on other hypotheses until those have been tested.  
 
The graph is continually updated each time a null hypothesis is successfully rejected, as 
follows:  
1. Pass k from successful H k according to the path  weights.  
2. Eliminate the vertex for H k. 
3. Connect all incoming arrows to outgoing arrow tails of the deleted vertex . 
4. Adjust path weights based on relative weights of previous parts of path. Maintain: 
a) Sum of endpoint -specific k =  and b) Sum of outgoing weights from each vertex = 1.  
5. If a new p ath duplicates an existing path, combine them and add their weights.  
 
 
On this study we are interested in testing the following hypotheses:

 H1 corresponds to the study’s primary endpoint. Testing will use the full study alpha : 
1 =  = 0.05. Hypothesis testing for secondary endpoints will only proceed if H 1 is 
rejected , in which situation 1 will be passed  to one or more of H 2, H3, and/or H 4 through 
path weights w 12, w13, and w 14, respectively . These weights will sum to 1 , and one or two 
of them may be 0 . 
 H2, H3, and H 4 correspond to higher priority secondary endpoints.  Their initial endpoint -
specific alphas are zero, because they are only tested if the study’s primary aim is met. If

 H5 through H 8 correspond to secondary endpoints with lower priority and/or likelihood of 
success.  Their initial endpoint -specific alphas are zero. Each of these may  receive alpha 
from H 2, H3, and/or H 4. Each of H 5 through H 8 may pass alpha to  the others, and this 
may involve loop -back.  
 All path weights will be provided in a separate, pre -specified analysis plan, with weights

We used the method of Obuchowski  (1995, 2000)12,19 to determine the number of readers 
required in a fully crossed design to provide 80% power at statistical significance level alpha 
= 0.05 for the multi -reader, multi -case (MRMC) F* -test when the number of positive cases 
(cancers) is 60 and the number of n on-cancer cases is 240. Calculations were made based 
on the following assumptions:  
 Endpoint:  Difference in average area under ROC curve (A) for  DBT plus S -View 
versus FFDM

  Target p ower = 0.80

 Average area under ROC curve (A) for FFDM, A 1 = 0.80 
 Under the null hypothesis  of inferiority , the average area under the ROC curve for 
DBT plus S -View  is A 2 = 0.75 
 For calculating power u nder the alternative hypothesis  of non -inferiority, A 2 = A1 
 Correlation of A within reader, between reading conditions; r1= 0.53

approximation ( Obuchowski, 1994)15. This variance depends on the value of A and 
on the numbers of cancer and non -cancer cases in the sample.  
Estimates of power for MRMC studies  are highly dependent on the assumptions above. We 
therefore also obtained the number of readers required to provide 80% protected power 
allowing for possible attrition or parameter misspecification:  
 15% a ttrition rate for either cases or readers.  
 Decrease  in the comparator metric , A1, to 90% of its assumed value.  
 If power decreased when a parameter value increased, we increased said parameter 
by 50% on the measurement scale or by 125% on the variance scale.  
 If power decreased when a parameter value decreas ed, we decreased said 
parameter by 33% on the measurement scale.

Appendix A:  Fujifilm FFDM and DBT Image Acquisition, Display, and Interpretation  
Note: The proposed brand and/or configuration of the ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134467].  
Overview of ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134468]’s ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134469] S -View (Figure B) mammography acquisition system 
generates both FFDM and DBT images. It is comprised of the X -ray exposure unit and acquisition 
workstation, which is FDA PMA approved  (P160031 ) for mammography  and digital breast 
tomosynthesi s image acquisition . S-View  images are created from the reconstructed DBT images. 
Without the need of additional radiation exposure to the patient, the S -View image is generated by 
“combining” the DBT images of that view into a single 2D synthetic mammogra phy image.  The S -
View image, which may look similar to a FFDM image, is automatically labeled as “S -View” to avoid 
confusion with the FFDM image . 
Fujifilm’s ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134418] (Figure C) mammography review workstation displays and supports the 
physician’s review of 2D mammography , DBT and S -View  images. It is comprised of the display 
accessories of the A SPI[INVESTIGATOR_134470] a PC (with image review 
and manipu lation software installed), a console monitor, and two high -resolution grayscale diagnostic 
display monitors.

Acquisition of FFDM and DBT  plus S -View  Images by [CONTACT_134535][INVESTIGATOR_134417] (Figure B) 
All FFDM and DBT  plus S -View  images of the enrolled study subjects were acquired on the 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134471]. For each study subject, the DBT and FFDM images were acquired 
under the same breast compression for each of the LCC, RCC, LMLO and RMLO views.  The 
DBT images will be acquired first and then the x -ray tube will return to the normal in relation to 
the detector and the FFDM image will be acquired. The S -View images will be reconstructed by 
[CONTACT_134536] (AWS) of the ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134472].  
Display of FFDM and DBT  plus S -View  Images on ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134418] (Figure C) 
Mammography images are displayed on the ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_134473]’s review. The 
console allows the user to manage various aspects of the system configurations and setup, 
including the modality work list, local archive, communications, and the selection of images to 
be displayed on the two high -resolution grayscale diagnostic display monitors. Each CC and 
MLO view of the breast can be seen as a single FFDM image or a DBT  plus S -View  images. 
The viewer supports typi[INVESTIGATOR_134474] -manipulation functions, such as windowing -and-leveling, 
zooming, etc.

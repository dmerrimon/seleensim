STUDY SUMMARY 
Protocol 
Number: INDV-6000-404 
Title:  An Open-label, treatment extensi on study for the Rapid Initiation of 
Extended-Release Buprenorphine Subcutaneous Injection 
(SUBLOCADE™) 
Rationale:  This study (INDV-6000-404) is to provide ongoing treatm ent with 
SUBLOCADE for up to 5 additional inje ctions and safety monitoring for 
subjects who initiated SUBLOC ADE following a single dose of 
transm
ucosal (TM) buprenorphine in stud y INDV-6000-403. 
Target 
Population: Subjects with moderate or severe opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) who are 
seeking medication for OUD (MOUD) and have completed INDV-6000-
403 stud y.  
Number of 
Subjects: Up to 25 adult subjects 
Objective:  The objective of this study is to as sess the longer-term safety of an 
abbreviated initiation protocol of SUBLOCADE in subjects who have 
completed INDV-6000-403.  It is also to provide treatment to these 
individuals while they seek longe r-term care arrangements, as it (on 
average) takes an individual with OUD 6 m
onths between seeking treatment 
and achievin g an appointment at a provider within the US.  
Study Design:   
Only subjects who have completed the End of Treatment (EOT) procedures 
for Study INDV-6000-403, have signed the INDV-6000-404 informed 
consent form (ICF), and meet all the enrollme
nt criteria may be considered 
for inclusion in this study.  
 
The INDV-6000-[ADDRESS_528561]’s first dose of 
SUBLOCADE in INDV-6000-403, ther efore the INDV-6000-403 EOT and 
the INDV-6000-404 screening and Day 1 visit for this study will occur 
within 2 days, thus the INDV-6000-403 EOT assessments will serve as the 
screening assessments for the Screen ing Visit (Day 1) of this study.

 Any AEs and concomitant medi cations ongoing at the INDV-6000-403 
EOT will be re-recorded fo r this stud
y. In addition, demographics, height, 
medical/psychiatric, substance and dr ug of abuse history will not be re-
collected and will be taken from the INDV-6000-[ADDRESS_528562] enrolled in the study 
prior to approval of protocol amendment 1, their detox and MOUD 
treatment history will be collected re trospectively at th eir next visit. 
 
On Day 1, eligible subjects will receive a SC injection of 300mg 
SUBLOCADE. Before departing the site , any new adverse events (AEs) or 
concomitant medications will be recorded. 
 
Subjects will return to the site for monthly injection visits every 4 weeks (-2 
/ +7 days) for a total of up to [ADDRESS_528563] of care and 
results for the following procedures w ill be recorded: urine pregnancy test 
(to be performed before SUBLOCAD E administration for all female 
subjects who are of childbearing pote ntial); urine drug screen (UDS) and 
evaluation of previous injection site  for potential reaction and evidence of 
attempts to remove the depot. For inj ections [ADDRESS_528564] of care 
throughout the study from  Day 1 through EOT. 
All subjects who receive SUBLOCAD E (including those who wish to 
discontinue early), will be encouraged to attend the EOT/ET visit 4 weeks 
after SUBLOCADE administration.  
At the EOT/ET Visit, results for the following procedures and assessments 
will be recorded:  urine pregnancy test  for all female subjects who are of 
childbearing potential; evaluation of pr evious injection site for potential 
reaction and evidence of attempts to remove the depot; UDS; use of 
concomitant medications and assessment for AEs. At every Visit options for 
continued care should be di scussed with the subject.

 1 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Background 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) is a neurobeha vioral syndrome charac terised by [CONTACT_491], 
compulsive seeking or use of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_419139], psyc hological and physical 
consequences ( SAMHSA 2004 ). This chronic, relapsing disease has grown to epi[INVESTIGATOR_11422]. The clinical cour se of OUD typi[INVESTIGATOR_419140], but the patient is never dis ease-free. Medications for OUD (MOUD) are 
recomm end
ed by [CONTACT_419164] 
(Kamp man 2015), com
bined with counselling/behavi oural therapy to provide a whole-
patient approach to the treatment of OUD.   
SUBLOCADE™ (extended-releas e buprenorphine) injection, fo r subcutaneous (SC) use 
(CIII) is an extended-release formulation of  buprenorphine, a mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_419141]. SUBLOCADE is administered on ce monthly by [CONTACT_419165]. SUBLOCADE uses 
buprenorphine and the ATRIGEL® Delivery System, which cons ists of a biodegradable 
polymer poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) w ith a carboxylic acid end group (PLGH), 
dissolved in a biocompatible solvent, N- methyl-2-pyrrolidone (N MP). SUBLOCADE is 
injected as a solution, and subsequent precip itation of the polymer creates a solid depot 
containing buprenorphine. After initial formation of the depot, bupre norphine is released 
via diffusion from, and the bi odegradation of, the depot.  
See SUBLOCADE USPI  [CONTACT_99876].

trea
tment with transmucosal (TM) bupre norphine for a minimum of [ADDRESS_528574] injection 
(SUBLOCADE [LOCATION_002] Pres cribing Information [USPI] ).  Study INDV-6000-403 
is being conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of starting SUBLOCADE 
treatm
ent following a shorter period of TM buprenorphine treatment. This study (INDV-
6000-404) is to provide ongoing treatment with SUBLOCADE for up to 5 additional 
injections and safety monitoring for subj ects who initiated SUBLOCADE following a 
single dose of transmucosal (TM) buprenorphine in study INDV-6000-403.

for the m a
intenance dose (all subsequent injections), based on the medical judgment of 
the Investigator as per the SUBLOCADE USPI .  
1.[ADDRESS_528577] to respi[INVESTIGATOR_419142]. Buprenorphine ha s been shown to be an efficacious and safe 
treatment for OUD when used as directe d. For this extensi on study, SUBLOCADE will 
be administered as recommended in the SUBLOCADE USPI.  
1.3.1 Risk Assessment  
The safety profile of buprenorphine is well-established, and the AE profile of 
buprenorphine is well characterised. Co mmonly reported treatment-emergent AEs 
include drug withdrawal syndrome, constipation, headache, nausea and vomiting. 
Buprenorphine has been approved for multiple indications and routes of administration 
(e.g., TM, buccal, intramuscular, intravenous, tr ansdermal, rectal and subcutaneous) in 
multiple countries and by [CONTACT_419166]. Buprenorphine extended-release SC 
injection was approved as a monthly treatment for OUD in 2017 ( SUBLOCADE USPI ).   
The most common adverse drug reactions with SUBLOCADE were constipation, nausea, 
hepatic enzyme increased, headache, injec
tion site pain, injection site pruritus, vomiting 
and fatigue. Injection site reac tions were generally mild to moderate in severity, none 
were serious, and they decreased in frequency with subsequent inj ections. There were no 
unexpected safety findings. The safety prof ile of SUBLOCADE observed in the Phase III 
studies was generally consiste nt with the known safety prof ile of buprenorphine, with the 
expected exception of injection site tolera bility and reaction.  
1.3.2 Benefit Assessment  
Clear efficacy was demonstrated both in th e pi[INVESTIGATOR_419143] ( SUBLOCADE USPI ). While 
subjects will receive limited benefit fr om participation in the single-dose (of 
SUBLOCADE) study (INDV-6000-403), particip ation in the combined INDV-6000-[ADDRESS_528578] th em from overdose as soon as 
they are willing to engage in treatment.  Recently reported data ( Wiest 2019 ) supports 
that buprenorphine, administered at doses resu lting in consistent plasma levels of 2ng/mL

 and 5ng/mL (similar to the concentrations resulting from both labelled doses of 
SUBLOCADE), is able to dose dependently  inhibit fentanyl-i nduced respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826].  Being able to in itiate treatment-seeking pa tients with SUBLOCADE on the 
1st day of treatment ma y therefore help to pr otect patients when they are most vulnerable.
  
1.3.3 Overall Risk-Benefit Summary  
Taken together, these findings indicate a fa vourable benefit/risk assessment for this 
extension of the single dose study (INDV-6000- 403) to evaluate a more rapid treatment 
initiation protocol for SUBLOC ADE in patients with OUD.

 significance (such as a severe headache). This  is not the same as “serious”, which is 
based on subject/event outcome or  action criteria usually associated with  events that pose 
a threat to a subject’ s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations.

Severe  Causes marked limitation in activity; some assistance is usually required; medical 
intervention or therap

10.5 Assessment of Causality 
The Investigator or a medically qualified sub -Investigator, trained on this study protocol, 
listed on the delegation of authority log is responsible for determining the AE 
relationship to the study drug.  
The following categor
ies will be used to define the relationship of an AE to the 
administration of the study drug:  
Not Related: Data are available to identify a clear alternative cause for the AE other 
than the study drug.  
 Related:  The cause of the AE is rela ted to the study drug an d cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_1604] (e.g., the s ubject’s clinical st ate, concomitant 
therapy and/or other interventions).  
A “reasonable possibility” is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments 
to suggest a causal relationship, rather than that a relations hip cannot be ruled out. The 
Investigator will use clinical judgment to de termine the relationshi p. Alternative causes, 
such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors 
and the temporal relationship of the even t to the study drug will be considered and 
investigated. The Investigator will also consu lt the USPI [INVESTIGATOR_419153]/her 
assessment. For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and ha s provided an assessment of causality.  
There may be situations when an SAE or AE  of special interest has occurred, and the 
Investigator has minimal information to incl ude in the initial report to Indivior or 
designated representative. However, it is impera tive that the Investigator always make an 
assessment of causality for ever y event prior to the initial transmission of the SAE or AE 
of special interest data to Indivior or designated represen tative. The Investigator may

 change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and amend the SAE 
or AE of special interest da ta collection tool accordingly. The causality assessment is one 
of the criteria used when determin ing regulatory reporting requirements. 
10.[ADDRESS_528619] result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/ 
or requires additional diagnostic  testing or intervention (medical, surgical), and/or 
requires additional significant treatment, and/or requires temporal or permanent 
discontinuation of study drug, or a change to dos ing other than as permitted by [CONTACT_990].   
If a subject experiences any of  the below Liver Chemistry cr iteria the Indivior medical 
monitor should be notified to discuss the subject’s course of action: 
1. The subject has ALT >3 × ULN and bilirubin >2 × ULN ( ˃35% direct bilirubin). 
2. The subject has ALT >3 × ULN and a ssociated with symptoms (new or 
worsening) believed to be related to he patitis (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, or  jaundice) or hypersensitivity (such as 
fever, rash or eosinophilia). 
3. The subject has ALT >5 × ULN but <8  × ULN persisting for >[ADDRESS_528620] has ALT >5 × ULN but <8 × ULN and cannot be monitored weekly

If the subject experiences Criterion 1, this is an SAE (important medical event) of special 
interest, that must be reported  to Indivior as per Section 11.2.[ADDRESS_528622]. In addition, the AE  that resulted in the depot removal needs to 
be reported; this is not an AE of special  interest. Additional de tails about the depot 
removal (e.g., whether the depot was removed by [CONTACT_419174] [i.e., whether the subject agreed to the 
removal]) also need to be reported. Depot removal should be reported using the same 
timing as for SAEs (see Section  11.2.1 ).

 11 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT 
11.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event 
The Investigator or designee is responsibl e for identifying, docume nting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an SAE. 
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria: 
Death 
Life-threatening 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419154] o r
 significant disability/incapacity 
Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offs pring of a subject who received study drug 
Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], may be consider ed an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardise th e subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such events are: 
○ intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
○ blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not  result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419155] ≥3 × ULN and bilirubin ≥2 × ULN (> 35% direct) are defined as 
SAEs of special interest (important medical event). 
An AE is considered “life-thr eatening” if the subject was at  immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include  a reaction that if it had occurred in a more 
serious form might have caused death. For example, study drug-induced hepatitis that 
resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening 
even though study drug-induced hepatitis can be fatal.  
The AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419156]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419157] (e.g., elective 
surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) should not be considered AEs 
or SAEs. If anything untoward is reported dur ing the procedure, that occurrence must be 
reported as an AE (either “serious” or “non-serious”) according to the usual criteria.  
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53060] (usually involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l or emergency ward for observation and/or 
treatment that would not have been appropr iate in the physician’s office or other

 outpatient setting. Complications that occu r during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17954]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419158], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155056]” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
An AE is incapacitating or di sabling if the experience resu lts in a substantial and/or 
perm
anent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 
11.2 Documenting Serious Adverse Events 
When an SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], labo ratory and diagnostic reports) pertaining 
to the event. The Investigator will then reco rd all relevant information regarding an SAE 
on the appropriate electronic or paper form(s).  
It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi [INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical 
records to Indivior in lieu of completi on of the SAE Reporting Form. However, there 
may be cases where copi[INVESTIGATOR_419159] s are requested by [CONTACT_419175]. In this instance, all subject  identifiers, with the exception of subject 
number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_419160].  
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical informa tion. In such cases, the diagnosis will be 
documented as an AE or SAE and no t the individual signs/symptoms. 
11.2.1 Investigator Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Once the Investigator determines that an even t meets the protocol definition of an SAE, 
the SAE will be reported to Indivior (or desi gnated representative) by [CONTACT_737] (or 
designee) within [ADDRESS_528623] 
provide an assessment of causality at the ti me of the initial report as described in 
Section 10.5 of the protocol.

11.2.2 Regulatory Reporting Requirements  for Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt receipt of notifications of SAEs to Indivior or designated repres entative from 
Investigators is essential in ensuring that legal obligations and et hical responsibilities 
regarding the safety of  subjects are m
et.  
Indivior has a legal responsibi lity to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of  a study drug.  Indivior or designated 
representative will comply with country-sp ecific regulatory requirements pertaining to 
safety reporting to Regulatory Author ities, IRBs and Investigators.  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is an  SAE related to the study 
drug administered in any dose and that, in its nature or severity, is inconsistent USPI. 
Indivior Global Safety will determine if an SAE meets the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R and 
distribute S[LOCATION_003]R reports according to local regu latory requirements and Indivior policy. 
An Investigator who receives the safety report  describing an SAE or other specific safety 
information (e.g., summary or line listing of SAEs, Dear Investigator  Letter) will file it 
with the USPI [INVESTIGATOR_419161], if required according to local requirements.

(i.e., termination [voluntary or  spontaneous] or birth).   
Pregnancy of a study subject wi thout associated unexpected or adverse sequelae is not a 
reportable AE but must be reported to Indivior Global Safety (or designated 
representative) using the Clinical Trial Pr egnancy Tracking Form within 24 hours of the 
Investigator or designee firs t being aware of the pregnanc y (contact [CONTACT_419177]).  
The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome (including premature 
termination) and status of mother and infant. Generally, follow-up will not be required 
for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of 
pregnancy will be reported, regardless of foetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) 
or indication for procedure.

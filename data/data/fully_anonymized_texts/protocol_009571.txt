Background:  
 
Closed -loop systems automate insulin delivery based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) 
values to minimize hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and in some cases also deliver glucagon to 
prevent and treat hypoglycemia. Closed -loop systems have been tested extensively in both the 
inpatient and o utpatient settings. Our group has previously developed both an insulin -only 
closed -loop system and a dual -hormone (insulin and glucagon) closed -loop system. The novelty 
of these closed -loop systems are their ability to automatically detect exercise and adj ust dosing in 
response to the exercise. Recently, we completed an outpatient closed -loop study, which tested 
the OHSU insulin -only closed -loop system with automated exercise detection [1]. Participants 
participated in four arms in randomized order: current care (their typi[INVESTIGATOR_412565], which 
included an insulin pump with or without a sensor), sensor -augmented pump  with predictive low 
glucose suspend (using a t:slim pump and Dexcom G5 sensor with a PLGS algorithm running on 
the smartphone), insulin -only closed -loop system with exercise detection, and bi -hormonal 
(insulin + glucagon) closed -loop system with exercise detection. Each arm was 4 days long, with 
two 12 hour in clinic visits on days 1 and 4, with the remainder of the time spent as an outpatient 
using a cloud -based remote monitoring system. During the time spent as an outpatient, 
participants went to work, s lept at home, travelled, and even went skiing. Participants performed 
moderate exercise for 45 minutes at 60% VO2max during both of the in clinic visits as well as 
performed one at home exercise session. The primary endpoints were percent time in 
hypoglyce mia (CGM <70 mg/dL) and percent time in target (CGM 70 -180 mg/dL) expressed as 
mean (SD). The mean time in hypoglycemia was the lowest with dual -hormone during the 
exercise period: 3.4±4.5% vs. 8.3±12.6% single -hormone (p=0.009) vs 7.6±8.0% predictive low 
glucose suspend (p<0.001) vs 4.3±6.8% current care where pre -exercise insulin adjustments 
were allowed (p=0.49). This type of manual adjustment was not allowed in any other arm and no 
snacks were given prior to exercise. Time in hypoglycemia was also the l owest with dual -
hormone during the entire 4 -day study: 1.3±1.0% vs. 2.8±1.7% single -hormone (p<0.001) vs. 
2.0±1.5% predictive low glucose suspend (p=0.04) vs. 3.1±3.2% current care (p=0.007). Time in 
range during the entire study was the highest with insul in-only closed -loop system: 74.3±8.0% 
vs 72.0±10.8% dual -hormone (p=0.44). The OHSU insulin -only closed -loop system performance 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] version 6         [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   May 21 , 2021

 was comparable to those reported in a recent meta -analysis of AP studies [2] which reported a 
mean time in range of 70.8% using insulin -only closed -loop systems vs 74.3% in our recent 
study. We have also completed a study on patients with T1D who used the OHSU dual -hormone 
AP for 22 hours within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_412566] 45 
minutes on a treadmill [3]. For this study, we used the OHSU bi -hormonal artificial pancreas 
system that adjusts dosing afte r an exercise announcement to reduce exercise -related 
hypoglycemia. Results showed that adjusting hormones during exercise reduced hypoglycemia.  
 
The study described within this protocol is designed to test the efficacy of a new modified 
insulin -only close d-loop algorithm, a model -predictive control (MPC) algorithm that modulates 
insulin delivery based on estimated activity level. The potential benefit of this type of algorithm 
is that it handles exercise not as a discrete event, but it automatically adjust s insulin delivery 
based on estimated activity level. This type of algorithm may significantly improve glucose 
control over the FMPD algorithm which is designed only to detect exercise over 4 meta bolic 
equivalent of tasks (METs)  for a specific duration of 45 minutes.      
  
Primary Objective:  
• To confirm superiority of the OHSU MPC exercise -enabled closed -loop system as 
measured by p ercent of time with sensed glucose less than 70 mg/dl as compared to the 
OHSU FMPD exercise -enabled closed -loop system.    
 
Secondary Objective:  
• To confirm superiority of the OHSU MPC exercise -enabled closed -loop as measured by 
[CONTACT_412592] -enabled closed loop 
system.    
Study Hypothesis:  
We propose that the use of the OHSU MPC exercise -enabled closed -loop system as compared to 
the OHSU FMPD exercise -enabled closed -loop system will increase the time in range as 
measured by [CONTACT_412593].   
 
Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint:  
• Percent of time with sensed glucose <70 mg/d l across the duration  of inpatient day  (Day 
3 MPC vs. Day 1  FMPD)  
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Percent of time with sensed glucose between 70 -180 mg/dl across the study duration  
• Percent of time with sensed glucose between 70 -180 mg/dl across the duration of the 
inpatient day ( Day 3 MPC vs. Day 1 FMPD )

 • Percent of time with sensed glucose between 70 – 180 mg/dl from the start of the in -
clinic exercise session until the start of the next meal  
• Percent of time with sensed glucose <70 mg/dl from the start of the in -clinic exercise 
session until the start of the next meal  
• Number of carbohydrate treatments (defined as 15 or 20 grams of carbohydrate)   
• Mean sensed glucose  
• Coefficient of variation of glucose  
• Percent of time with sensed glucose <54 mg/dl  
• Percent of time with sensed glucose >180 mg/dl  
• Mean amount of insulin delivered per day (in units/kg)  
Study Type  
This is a single center, randomized, two treatment, crossover trial designed to compare the 
glucose control resulting from the use of the OHSU MPC exercise -enabled AP system as 
compared to the OHSU FMPD exercise -enabled AP system.  
 
Study Population  
Study population will be adults with type 1 diabetes, ages 21 – [ADDRESS_520114] 80% power to  detect a paired difference for a two -sided 
Wilcoxon signed -rank test of the difference between use of exercise -enabled MPC algorithm and 
FMPD algorithm with alpha set at 0.05 for our primary outcome of percent of time <70 mg/dl. 
We use the sample size for  a one -sample t -test, n, with an adjustment factor for the double 
exponential (or Laplace) distribution of the difference such that the final sample size n' = n/(2/3). 
We anticipate a mean difference of 1.2 (SD 2.5) based on our prior published AP study da ta. For 
normally -distributed secondary outcomes, we have >80% power to detect differences of 0.[ADDRESS_520115] for the mean difference at the 0.05 significance 
level. These calculations were  performed using PASS version.  We propose to enroll 25 
participants in this study as this will yield more than 80% power as stated above (see Participant 
Recruiting).   
 
Protocol Summary:  
Participants will undergo two approximately 76 hour studies.  See Figure 1  &2 for a diagram of 
the study flow  and structure . During each of these intervention visits, participants will wear an 
Omnipod to deliver insulin and a Dexcom G6 CGM to measure glucose.  The CGM system will 
provide sensed glucose data every 5 minutes.  Sensed  glucose data will be wirelessly transmitted 
via Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) from the Dexcom G6 transmitter to the smartphone master 
controller every five minutes.  The smart phone will wirelessly communicate via BTLE to an 
Omnipod through a PDM (Insulet C orp.). During one of the studies, glucose will be controlled

• Pregnancy.  
• Intention of becoming pregnant.  
Visit Procedures  
Screening (Visit 1)  
Screening will take place within 12 weeks prior to the 1 week run -in period (Visit 2).  All 
screening visits will take place at OHSU’s Oregon Clinical Translational Research  Institute 
(OCTRI) outpatient clinic, the AIMS lab in Biomedical Engineering Dept at CHH1 or the Harold 
Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center. The participant will be sent the consent form prior to the 
screening by [CONTACT_412598] [ZIP_CODE] version 6         [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   May [ADDRESS_520122] will be used by [CONTACT_464]. After the 
participant has signed the consent, a copy of the consent/authorization form will be given to the 
participant. The original will be kept for the source document.  
 
A capi[INVESTIGATOR_30135] (CBG) will be obtained and measured by a Contour Next glucose 
meter  and recorded after consenting. Prior to measurement of any blood samples, the meter will 
undergo quality control testing with two different glucose levels, one high and one low, and both 
values must fall within the accepted range for a meter to be used.  
 
Study personnel will review medical history, and medications. Height, weight, pulse, and blood 
pressure will be obtained.  A study investigator will perform a physical examination, excluding 
breast and pelvic exams. Females of child -bearing potential will  take a urine pregnancy test, 
which must be negative to participate.  A venous blood sample will be taken for the following 
tests: hemoglobin A1C, complete blood count, complete metabolic set (including creatinine, liver 
set, and electrolytes).  If the par ticipant has already had these lab studies done within the past [ADDRESS_520123] of the blood draw. An 
EKG will be completed. A study investigator will assess inclusion/exclusion criteria and review  
the participant’s medical record for clarification as needed.   When feasible, t he participant’s 
insulin pump and glucose sensor, if applicable, will be downloaded  before enrollment . A three -
digit participant ID number will be assigned to the participant.   This visit will take approximately 
1.[ADDRESS_520124] be negative before 
further participation is allowed. This visit w ill take approximately 30 -60 minutes .  
 
Participants will receive training on how to use and calibrate the Dexcom G6 CGM system 
including changing out the sensor every 10 days.  The wire glucose sensor is sterile and 
commercially available from DexcomTM and will be used for single use only as directed by [CONTACT_13989].  Participants will be trained to insert the sensor into the subcutaneous tissue of the 
abdomen after appropriate preparation of the abdominal skin per the manufacturer’s directions.  
Partici pants will be trained how to pair the Dexcom G6 transmitter to the iPancreas app on the 
smart phone, start and stop a new sensor session and how to enter calibrations. The Dexcom G6 
does not require calibrations. As part of the training, study staff will r eview with the participants 
that Dexcom G6 values can be inaccurate. In the event that the participant’s symptoms (such as 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] version 6         [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   May 21 , 2021  
9 
 symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia) are discrepant with the G6 CGM reading, then the 
participants will be instructed to perfor m a CBG and use this CBG value to make treatment 
decisions and use the CBG value to calibrate the Dexcom G6 device.  Participants will be 
provided with a copy of the Dexcom G6 user guide.    
 
The CGM alerts will be set at 70 mg/dL and 300 mg/dL. Participan ts will be trained how to 
begin a run -in study on the iPancreas app at home after two hours when the sensor warm -up is 
completed. Participants will be given a Dexcom G6 transmitter and sensor to insert the day 
before each treatment visit along with a Conto ur Next meter for measuring their capi[INVESTIGATOR_316630].  
 
There is the option to complete this visit via Webex with the study devices delivered to the 
participant and study staff virtually connecting with participants for training on the devices and 
study procedures while they are at home. Participants will complete a urine pregnancy test at 
home provided by [CONTACT_412599] 7 days prior . 
 
76 hour Treatment Visits  
The participant will be asked to check his/her glu cose before driving to the clinic and to bring a 
snack in the car in case hypoglycemia does occur (in which case, the participant must park and 
treat the hypoglycemia).  After the first treatment visit, the washout period will be [ADDRESS_520125] at the beginning of the participant’s first closed -loop study. We 
will inquire whether the participant has had changes in their medications and/or medical history 
to confirm the participant hasn’t developed any study exclusion criteria. A capi[INVESTIGATOR_316630] (CBG) will be obtained and measured by a Contour Next glucose meter.  When they 
arrive, participants will be given 15-20 grams of oral carbohydrate if the CBG reading is less 
than 70 mg/dl.  CBG values > 300 mg/dl will be managed at the discretion of the investigator 
with a correction bolus and serum ketones will be checked.  If serum ketones are ≥ 0. 6 mM, the 
study w ill not be started and insulin therapy will be guided by [CONTACT_412600].   
 
During each treatment visit, glucose will be controlled using either: 1) the OHSU MPC exercise -
enabled closed -loop mode or 2) the OHSU FMPD exercise -enabled closed -loop mo de. The first 
[ADDRESS_520126] 8 partici pants using the MPC mode, they will 
stay at OHSU during the day and go home at night , using the system in open -loop mode while 
off campus . If safety criteria are met, as outlined below, subsequent participants will be at home 
for the remainder of the inter vention period, returning on Day 4 to the clinic to return all devices. 
A code team is available immediately by [CONTACT_412601].

 Inpatient Visits (~[ADDRESS_520127] 8 participants, 12  hours for remainder of participants)  
An Omnipod (510K#042792 ) will be filled with Novolog® or Humalog® insulin for all studies. 
We will use only name [CONTACT_412617], not generic insulin. We will provide the  participants with 
kits to replace the pod at  home  in case of pod  malfunction  or dislodgement at  home. The 
Omnipod will be primed and inserted as directed by [CONTACT_3455]. Research staff will train 
participants on the approved pod placement options from the Omnipod User Guide. Participants 
will wear a Polar watch to inform the controller. Participants will disconnect his/her own pump 
and remove his/her own insulin infusion set once insulin delivery has started via the Omnipod. 
The research staff will initialize the system and begin the closed -loop study with the correct 
mode, either FMPD or MPC based on the participant’s randomization, using the iPancreas smart 
phone application. Two staff will review each of the settings to confirm the settings are inputted 
correctly. The participant will be given enough study supplies for the 76 hour visit.  A study 
investi gator will be available in person or by [CONTACT_412602] 76 hour visit.  
 
Study staff will complete a training with each participant on using the Dexcom G6, the Omnipod 
system, and the Polar watch. Participants will be shown how to use the smartphone  user interface 
which includes: entering basal profiles, insulin carb ratios and sensitivity, activating and 
deactivating Omnipods, giving meal boluses, carb treatments, blood glucose values and ketone 
levels, addressing alerts, troubleshooting the devices c onnection to the phone via Bluetooth, and 
pausing the study.   Instruction will be  given  on identifying an Omnipod malfunction. The time 
required for this training will vary, depending on the experience of each participant, but will be 
sufficient to help h im/her become comfortable using the smart phone  and changing the Omni pod. 
If the participant experiences difficulties using the Omnipod during the study period, study staff 
will be available to educate and support by [CONTACT_648].  Training will include that the s mart bolus 
calculator available in open loop mode is a suggestion and that participants should use their 
judgement on what insulin dose to take as the bolus calculator is not aware of certain 
circumstances such as illness or alcohol use.   
 
The participant  will need to demonstrate competency in operating the system before study staff 
leave the room.  A competency assessment will be completed throughout the day of the first 
closed -loop visit. Each participant will start the G6 sensor and start the Omnipod on  their own 
during onboarding. Participants will need to show competency in accepting exercise detection, 
entering fingerstick glucose values and announcing meals during the day on campus. Participants 
will demonstrate competency in the following using a si mulated closed loop study: pausing and 
resuming a study, using the smart bolus calculator and manual bolus while in pause mode, for 
FMPD: force start exercise, cancel exercise, for MPC: disabling exercise adjustment. Participants 
will be given a pager numb er to call for any prob lems during the 76 hour visit. The companion 
will accompany the participant to receive training (or be previously trained) on treatment in case 
of severe  hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], including administration of rescue carbohydrates and use 
of emergency glucagon kit.   Companions will also be trained on the closed -loop system. This 
training may be completed virtually.  
 
The algorithm will push data up to a cloud server that can be monitored remotely every 5 
minutes. A study coordinator will  be available at all times for the visits with the ability to 
monitor iPancreas remotely via a cloud system on the web in the event of any issues. iPancreas 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] version 6         [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   May 21 , 2021  
11 
 will generate alerts on the smartphone according to Appendix D. The participants will all be 
traine d as to the action required by [CONTACT_412603]. Each alert has a specific condition to be met for it 
to be considered serviced (i.e. enter treatment with oral carbohydrates).  The refractory period is 
also specific to each alert with shorter refractory periods for alerts that concern participant safety.   
If the participant does not appropriately respond to the alert in the allotted  timeframe, the alert 
will push to the study coordinator and the on -call investigator according to Appendix D. At that 
time, the coo rdinator will pull up the web -based monitoring system. The study investigator and 
technician may intervene with a telephone call, text or a personal visit at any time. If the 
participant cannot be reached and sensor glucose is below 50 mg/dl, the emergency  contacts 
provided by [CONTACT_412604]. If the alert is still un -serviced and study staff are 
unable to reach the participant or either of the emergency contacts, emergency medical services 
will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. To facilitate this, the phone will track the participant’s location and push GPS 
coordinates to the cloud server approximately every [ADDRESS_520128] a 
cell phone numb er on file that can receive texts with pushed alerts.  
 
During all studies, sensed glucose data will be wirelessly transmitted via BTLE from the 
Dexcom G6 transmitter to the insulin -delivery algorithm every five minutes.  The insulin -
delivery algorithm wil l calculate insulin doses and will run on a smartphone. The smart phone 
will wirelessly communicate via BTLE to a PDM communicating to an Omnipod for automated 
insulin delivery.    
Both the FMPD and MPC control algorithms include a predictive low glucose s uspend algorithm 
(PLGS).  The PLGS algorithm includes (1) an algorithm to predict hypoglycemia and (2) a 
mechanism to override the controller and shut off insulin if low glucose is predicted by [CONTACT_412605].  The predictive low glu cose suspend algorithm will be 
continuously monitoring the trend of blood glucose with every new glucose value. If the sensed 
glucose is within 70 -140 mg/dl and predicted to fall below 90 mg/dl within the next 30 minutes 
according to the LSTM algorithm, in sulin infusion will be turned off.  If this occurs, the control 
algorithm will shut off insulin for a maximum of 120 minutes suspension within any 150 minute 
window. Suspension will be limited to 180 minutes during the nighttime (11pm -7am). After 5 
minutes  of insulin suspension , insulin delivery will resume if sensor glucose is above 70 mg/dl 
and predicted to rise above 120 mg/dl at 30 minutes in the future.  
  
If at any time study staff determines that a sensor can no longer be used, a new sensor will be 
inserted. In order to ensure safety and to assess sensor accuracy, the participant will be asked to 
check their blood glucose two times during the day (typi[INVESTIGATOR_412567]), 
for symptoms of hypoglycemia, and in response to system alert (such as for low or high sensor 
alerts).  We will also instruct patients to perform  a capi[INVESTIGATOR_412568].  Participants will be instructed to check a fingerstick glucose 
at bedtime and again at 2am on exercise days. The participant will be able to check his/her 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_412569] 2 times a day if they feel they need to.  If the participant’s 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] version 6         [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   May 21 , 2021  
12 
 blood glucose is < 70 mg/dl or is experiencing symptoms of hypoglycemia, he/she will be 
instructed to treat with [ADDRESS_520129] fo r more than 30 minutes, the Omnipod will begin insulin delivery according 
to a pre -set basal profile(s) inputted for the participant at study start. When this occurs for a lost 
sensor, iPancreas will activate the predictive low glucose suspend feature if t he last known 
sensor value was within the range of 70 -140 mg/dl and predicted to fall below 90 mg/dl within 
thirty minutes or if the sensor glucose is less than 70 mg/dl. Insulin is suspended for [ADDRESS_520130], lunch and dinner at approximately 8am, noon and 5 pm 
respectively. Meals will be announced to the c ontroller. For each meal, food items will be self -
selected . The number of grams of carbohydrates will be counted by [CONTACT_412606]. Immediately before eating, each participant will receive 100% (nominal) of

selected meal s will be offered during FMPD Day 1 and MPC Day 3  inpatient days, and in the 
event a particular food item is not available, a different item with a similar amount of 
carbohydrate will be provided.  
 
Participants will perform activities of daily living  (ADLs) , such as vacuuming, washing dishes, 
and folding laundry for approximately 30 min at 10am  or 3pm depending on the study (see 
‘Safety assessment – first 8 participants using MPC’) .  Participants will complete a 30-minute  
aerobic exercise video at 10am  or 3pm . (see ‘Safety assessment – first 8 participants using 
MPC’).  See Figure 3 below.

 During the exercise period, there will be defined rules for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_99492], including:  
• If the participant feels unwell,  
• If the participant develops hypoglycemic symptoms, such as excessive sweating, 
shaking/tremors, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], feelings of dread or panic, light -headedness, nausea, 
difficulty concentrating or the like,  
• If the participant develops chest pain/pressure,  
• If the participant develops undue shortness of breath (SOB),  
• Signs of poor perfusion: light -headedness, confusion, ataxia, pallor, cyanosis, nausea, or 
cold and clammy skin  
• If the maximum heart rate of the participant (MHR) is exceeded,  
• For patient preference.  
If the exercise is stopped prematurely, the duration of exercise will be noted by [CONTACT_412607], the exercise will be stopped 
after that same time duration for subsequent studies. For participant safety, if capi[INVESTIGATOR_412571] < 70 mg/dl at any point during the exercise period, the participant will consume 15 g 
of carbohydrates and delay completion of exercise until blood gl ucose raises above 80 mg/dl. If 
glucose fails to rise above 80 mg/dl after a carbohydrate treatment during exercise, a second 
treatment of [ADDRESS_520131].  
 
Participant s will wear a Polar watch for collecting heart rate and accelerometry data. The Polar 
watch transmits this data to the smartphone  controller via Bluetooth. iPancreas will convert the 
heart rate and accelerometry data into an estimated energy expenditure to determine if the 
participant is exercising. If the communication is not working between the Polar watch and the 
smartphone at the time of exercise during the inpatient visit, exercise may be delayed until 
communication is restored.  We are aware that there is a risk of hyperglycemia if the participant 
stops exercising after a short time with continued adjustments to insulin.  When using the FMPD 
mode: 1) an exercise cancellation option is available on the user interface for up to 30 minutes 
after the start of exercise that will revert insulin parameters to their nominal values and 2) if 
exercise is not detected by [CONTACT_412608], an exercise 
announcement button on the iPancreas user interface will be used. When using t he MPD mode, 
the user can disable the exercise adjustment , thereby [CONTACT_412609].  
 
Safety assessment – first [ADDRESS_520132] 8 participants 
will stay at OHSU  during the day for the entire period of using the MPC algorithm and go home 
to sleep each night (approximately 7pm -7am) , using the system in open -loop mode while off 
campus . These participants will still complete only one in -clinic day for the FMPD arm (Day 1).  
 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] version 6         [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   May [ADDRESS_520133] 30 minutes apart prior to discharge. Participants will wait to discharge home at 
approximate ly 7pm if capi[INVESTIGATOR_412572] <85 and or >300 mg/dl or at the discretion of the 
study investigator, and treatment will be at the  discretion  of the study investigator. Investigator 
will review the physician portal to assess participant’s insulin on board before they go home.  
These participants will use the system in open -loop mode while at home. Participants will be 
given a snack to take with them in case they develop h ypoglycemia or hypoglycemic symptoms 
on the commute home.  
 
We will complete an interim analysis after the first 8 subjects using the MPC assessing time 
spent with CGM < 54 mg/dL, <70 mg/dL, and > 300 mg/dL and any adverse events. The MPC 
data will be comp ared to the equivalent data from the FMPD studies. If the interim analysis 
shows that the MPC data is comparable to the FMPD studies and presents no safety concerns, we 
will proceed to studying the MPC during outpatient visits. If it does not or if there a re any 
instances of severe hypoglycemia or DKA (unrelated to infusion set failure), then the study will 
be halted, changes will be made as appropriate to algorithm and the protocol and a plan will be 
submitted to FDA and IRB that will need to be approved b efore further studies are conducted.  
After the algorithm adjustments are made, an additional [ADDRESS_520134] approxima tely 12  hour study visit after 8 participants are deemed 
safe to sleep at home and successfully completed the MPC arm without any events of severe 
hypoglycemia o r diabetic ketoacidosis. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as event that required the 
assistance of another person due to altered consciousness, and required another person to actively 
administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Diabeti c ketoacidosis is 
classified as: symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting, serum ketones >1.5 
mmol/L or moderate/large urine ketones, either arterial blood pH<7.3 or venous pH<7.24 or 
serum bicarbonate <15, and treatment provided in a hea lth care facility. If an event of severe 
hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis should occur, the study will be halted and a description of 
the serious adverse event and a new risk mitigation plan will be submitted to the FDA. The study 
will only resume onc e FDA approval is received.

 We are aware that there is a risk of severe hypoglycemia while the participants are at home. The 
system will alert if the sensed glucose values fall below 70 mg/dl prompting the participant to 
obtain a capi[INVESTIGATOR_412573]. Participants will be required to live with at least one 
other person age 18 or older and live within 40 miles of OHSU. All participants will provide two 
emergency contacts to study staff and will be given an emergency glucagon hypokit if th ey don’t 
already have one.  
 
In case of a system error that cannot be corrected immediately with the participant off campus, 
the participant will be able to go into open -loop mode. This will allow the Omnipod to begin 
basal insulin delivery for a pre -set basal profile(s) inputted for the participant at the study start. 
Participants will be able to give meal boluses and corrections through the Omnipod while in 
open -loop mode. When the error is resolved, the participant can resume closed -loop mode and 
the sys tem will resume.  If the participant goes into open -loop mode, this will be visible on the 
cloud server and may prompt a telephone call from study staff to determine the issue and the best 
way to resolve it. The participant may contact [CONTACT_412610] t ime during the outpatient 
portion of the visit.  
 
Discharge from inpatient clinic  
If the participant’s schedule does not allow them to return to the clinic before the [ADDRESS_520135] 8 particip ants using MPC exercise -enable mode, as detailed 
above . Capi[INVESTIGATOR_412574]. Participants will wait to 
discharge home if capi[INVESTIGATOR_412572] <85 and or >300 mg/dl or at the discretion of the 
study investigator, and treatment will be at the  discretion  of the study investigator. Once 
participant’s capi[INVESTIGATOR_412575] 85 -300 mg/dl, they can be discharged home. For 
all participants using the MPC mode, the i nvestigator will review the phys ician portal to assess 
participant’s insulin on board before they go home. Participants will be given enough supplies to 
continue running the study while at home for 2 days. After the participant is discharged on Day 
1, he/she will return home for Day 2 an d Day 3 and return to OHSU on the morning of Day 4 to 
return all devices and end the study.   Participants will be instructed to not eat a meal after he/she 
leaves the inpatient clinic  after the Day 1 visit. Starting the morning of Day 2, participants will  
be instructed to eat meals and snacks as they normally would. Participants will be instructed that 
his/her companion will be required to stay with them each night while an outpatient.  
 
For the two days spent as an outpatient, participants will be asked to  workout using the study 
video in the morning at a time of their choice on either Day 2 or Day 3. Participants will be 
asked to fill out the specifics of the exercise in a journal. Participants will be asked to not 
exercise on the other day spent at home. During the FMPD visit, participants will be instructed to 
only accept exercise detection on the app if they are exercising for 20 minutes  or longer . 
Participants will be reminded to check their blood glucose before and after exercise (as soon as 
possible a fter exercise but no later than 15 minutes after the completion of exercise). For 
participant safety, capi[INVESTIGATOR_412576] 100 mg/dl or higher to begin exercise while 
the participant is at home. Participants will be given instructions to take ad ditional carbs at the

attended a training session on the study pr esent while the participant exercises at home. For at 
home exercise, the companion will stay after the exercise until the participant’s CBG is > 100 
mg/dl or for [ADDRESS_520137] remote monitoring. 
Staff will continue to monitor until exercise is completed and glucose is above 100 mg/dL.  
 
Return to the Outpatient Clinic at OHSU  
On the fourth day, participants wil l return to the AIMS lab in Biomedical Engineering Dept at 
CHH1, the CTRC clinic, or the Harold Schn itzer Diabetes Health Center in the morning.  
Participants will be asked to arrive early enough to provide sufficient time to allow the pods to 
be removed b efore the 72 hour mark of pod use. The study will be terminated and the 
participant’s own insulin pump will be restarted. The study investigator will consult with the 
participant regarding appropriate insulin dosing for the remainder of the day. The Polar watch, 
Omnipod and Dexcom sensor will be removed from the participant. All infusion and sensor sites 
will be inspected for signs of irritation or infection. In addition, the sensor will be inspected for 
the possibility of breakage or fracture. If there is any evidence of sensor breakage, it will be 
recorded. If an area of inflammation of 1 cm or greater exists around the point of insertion, a de -
identified photograph will be taken of the area and the participant will return 1 -3 days later for a 
follow -up vi sit. A capi[INVESTIGATOR_412577]. Participants will be given oral carbohydrate for values below 85 mg/dl, and will 
be given an insulin bolus if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_54851] 150

There is the option to complete this visit by [CONTACT_412611]. Participants will be given shippi[INVESTIGATOR_412578].  Participants will connect with a study coordinator and investigator 
virtually to complete the visit.  
If a study visit is stopped prematurely, such as due to technical problems, the participant will be 
asked if they can repeat the study visit that was terminated early with additional compensation 
provided. Repeating the study visit will be optional.  
 
Hypo glycemia Treatment Guidelines  
 CBG < 70 mg/dl  
• Give 15 grams of oral carbohydrate.  
• Repeat treatment every 15 minutes as needed to raise blood glucose ≥70 mg/dl.   
Presence of STUPOR, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS, or SEIZURE  
• Give 1 mg glucagon IM  
• Verify that insu lin is turned off.  
• Further management per study investigator.  
Hyperglycemia Treatment Guidelines  
If the sensed glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dl, the participant will be instructed to check their blood 
glucose and to check the Omnipod for malfunction. This would in clude checking for insulin

phone running the algorithm.  
 
If capi[INVESTIGATOR_412579] 300 mg/dl for more than 2 hours or is ≥ 400 mg/dl at any 
time, the participant will be instructed to check serum ketones using the Abbott Precision Xtra 
meter and to change out the Omnipod. If serum ketones are over 0.6 mM, the on -call study 
investigator will be alerted to discuss proper management, including deliveri ng a correction 
bolus. In addition, the participant will be encouraged to drink sugar -free liquids. If serum ketones 
are above 1.5 mM at any time, the study will be stopped and insulin will be administered as 
directed by [CONTACT_412612].  
 
Cleanin g and Disinfecting  
All devices will be cleaned and disinfected between participants.  The smart phone, Dexcom G6 
transmitter, heart rate monitor and Om nipod PDMs are cleaned by [CONTACT_464].   Technicians who 
are disinfecting units will wash hands thoroughly and wear gloves.   All items will undergo 
intermediate -level disinfection using Oxivir TB disposable wipes.  The disinfectant will be 
applied and all owed to air dry . After disinfection, when the units are completely dry, they will be 
placed in a sealed bag labeled with  participant information.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_412580] -loop study will be stopped and open -loop control w ill be resumed under the guidance 
of the on call study investigator if any of the following occur after the start of the study: 1) 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_412581] < 40 mg/dl at any time point, 2) capi[INVESTIGATOR_412582] 
400 mg/dl on two occasions (120 min or more apart within a 4 hour window), 3) capi[INVESTIGATOR_412583] 400 mg/dl on two occasions more than 120 minutes apart but outside of the 4 
hour window and during that time, the capi[INVESTIGATOR_412584] 250 mg/dl, 4) 
serum ketones are above 1.5 mM at any time, 5) seizure or unconsciousness associated with 
hypoglycemia.  
 
Entire study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_412585], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death or any other 
occurrence considered serio us by [CONTACT_978] [CONTACT_73651]. If any studies are stopped for 
severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis, then the entire study will be halted. Severe 
hypoglycemia is defined as event that required the assistance of another person due to altered 
consciousness, and required another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or 
other resuscitative actions. Diabetic ketoacidosis is classified as: symptoms such as polyuria, 
polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting, serum ketones >1.5 mmol/L or moder ate/large urine ketones, 
either arterial blood pH<7.3 or venous pH<7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15, and treatment 
provided in a health care facility. If an event of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis 
should occur, the study will be halted and a des cription of the serious adverse event and a new 
risk mitigation plan will be submitted to the FDA. The study will only resume once FDA 
approval is received. In addition, if there is any unexpected event such as death or patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the studies  will be stopped until the root cause is evaluated.

 The Fading Memory Proportional Derivative (FMPD) Algorithm  
The FMPD algorithm determines insulin delivery rates based on proportional error, defined as 
the difference between the current glucose level and  the target level, and the derivative error, 
defined as the rate of change of the glucose. Each of these errors is calculated over a time 
interval. The “fading memory” designation refers to weighting recent errors more heavily than 
remote errors. This weig hting provides an adaptive component to the algorithm. In simple terms, 
the insulin rate is increased for high or rising glucose levels. Gain factors determine the degree to 
which proportional or derivative errors lead to changes in the delivery rate.  
 
For the FMPD exercise -enabled mode, the exercise threshold will be set to 4 METs/min for 
every participant at the start of the study. If the corrected MET value is greater than [ADDRESS_520138] exercise period, ex ercise is considered to be 
ongoing.  An exercise dosing adjustment algorithm will be used when exercise is detected that 
has been previously tested and published.  When exercise is detected while in the FMPD 
exercise -enabled mode, and the participant confi rms he/she is exercising, insulin will be turned 
off for 30 minutes (nominal) immediately after detection of exercise. Subsequently, the insulin 
infusion rate will be reduced to 50% (nominal) for a period of 1 hour (nominal). The exercise 
detection algorit hm will prompt the participant if exercise is occurring prior to adjusting dosing.  
For example, if the participant’s METs exceed a threshold of [ADDRESS_520139] this and 
ask the participant if they are exercising.  If the participant acknowledge s this and says “Yes”, 
the AP will adjust the dosing.  If the participant selects that they are not exercising, iPancreas 
will present a dropdown menu from which the participant can select their current activity for 
logging purposes ( e. g. housework).  It will also present several choices for the amount of time 
that exercise detection will be suspended so that the participant will not continuously receive 
detection alerts during that activity (15, 30 or 60 minute suspension).  If the participant says 
“No”, this is considered a false alert because the algorithm has detected exercise, but the 
participant was not actually exercising.  Because these false alerts can be annoying to the 
participants, the AP includes an adjustable exercise detection threshold.  The  adjustable exercise 
detection threshold works as follows:  
At the start of the study, the participants’ exercise detection threshold will be set to 4 METs.  
• On the first day of the study, when the participant exercises at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the AP 
records the p articipants’ METs during exercise and also records the participants’ METs 
during activities of daily living and other non -exercise events.   
• Based on data from this controlled setting, a “lower bound MET” for that participant will 
be calculated based on a lower -bound confidence interval set around their METs recorded 
during exercise.  
• If that participants’ lower bound MET during exercise is greater than 4, their maximum 
allowable exercise threshold value (MAETV) will be set to the lower bound MET.  
Otherwise , the MAETV will remain at 4.  
• Every time a false alert occurs for detecting exercise, the participants’ exercise detection 
threshold will increase by 0.25 MET.  However, the exercise detection threshold will 
never exceed the MAETV described above.  
The Mod el Predictive Control (MPC) Algorithm  
IRB [ZIP_CODE] version 6         [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   May [ADDRESS_520140] glucose outcomes over a predicted 
horizon (Np), and mathematically solve for the optimal insulin doses across the control horizon 
(Nc) to bring the participant to target. The model is updated at each timestep by a Kalman filter, 
which uses the difference between CGM observations and model predictions to update the 
physiologic model states.  In short, a model -predictive controller uses a physiologic model to 
calcu late how much insulin is required to bring someone to glucose target, and these predictions 
are adapted to the specific participant using a Kalman filter.  
 
For the MPC exercise -enabled mode, there is a model within the controller that takes as an input 
the aerobic metabolic expenditure in addition to the CGM and meal inputs.   The algorithm uses 
heart rate and accelerometer data collected on the patient’s body to calculate metabolic 
expenditure.   The metabolic expenditure then acts on the model for the in sulin dynamics, 
whereby [CONTACT_412613] a more substantial 
effect of insulin on the CGM (i.e. the CGM will drop more in response to more intense aerobic 
exercise and with longer duration exercise).   In this way, the model within the MPC control 
algorithm is always aware of exercise as a continuous input to the system and can respond 
dynamically to short or long, light, moderate, or intense exercise bouts.   We expect that the MPC 
controller will be able to dyn amically adapt to either short or long exercise bouts.   We also 
expect the MPC to dynamically adapt to in -home exercise better, which can be more variable 
than static exercise that is performed within a clinic under controlled conditions.   
Since the MPC mo de treats exercise differently than the FMPD mode, some exercise alerts to the 
user will not populate.  The low glucose alert will populate when sensor glucose goes below 70 
mg/dl, instead of 85 mg/dl in FMPD mode with exercise detection.  The alert not al lowing 
exercise when ketones are above 0.6 mM will not populate while in MPC mode, but the 
participants will be coached not to exercise when ketones are high.  
Statistical methods  
The primary study endpoint is percent of time with glucose sensor <70 mg/dL  during the 
inpatient clinic day . The hypothesis to be tested is the MPC exercise -enabled closed -loop system 
will increase time in range as compared to the FMPD exercise -enabled closed -loop system. As 
our main approach, we will perform a two -sided Wilcoxon  test for the paired differences. This 
test is widely used and easily interpreted. However, it cannot accommodate missing data or 
estimate crossover effects, and while we do not anticipate that these will affect our study 
outcomes, we plan to conduct a sup plemental analysis using a linear regression model with 
bootstrapped standard errors, which do not require distributional assumptions. In resampling for 
the bootstrap, we will use study subjects as the sampling unit to account for correlation between 
their repeated observations. The general model is as follows:  
(1)  𝑌𝑖𝑗=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑇𝑟𝑡𝑗+𝛽2𝑆𝑒𝑞𝑖+𝛽3𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑 𝑗 
In this model, the outcome Y ij is the percent of time with glucose sensor <70 mg/dL for person i 
in observation period j. Trtj represents th e treatment arm (MPC=1, FMPD=0). Seq i is an indicator 
for sequence (AB vs BA) and Period j indicates when Trtj occurred in the sequence. The 
coefficient β0 represents the mean response for FMPD, and the coefficient β1 represents the 
difference between treat ments to be tested. The coefficients β2 and β3, mean differences for 
sequence or period, are both expected to equal zero; a large effect or significance test with p -
value <0.[ADDRESS_520141]. Hypothesis tests will be two -sided 
with type I error set to 0.05. Because statistical tests are specified and prioritized a priori  and our 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] version 6         [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   May [ADDRESS_520142] for multiple comparisons.  
Model fit and alternatives:  Goodness of fit statistics and model fitting diagnostics will be used to 
assess for influential points and to evaluate alternative model specifications. If needed to 
compensa te for some skew and heteroscedasticity in secondary outcomes, we will use 
bootstrapped variance estimators and compare these against robust estimates.  
Missing data : Our primary approach will include all available data as an intention -to-treat 
analysis, r egardless of whether study subjects completed both arms. An observation will be 
included if at least [ADDRESS_520143] very low levels of 
missingness; in our previous four -arm crossover study, only one subject withdrew befo re 
completing at least two arms. Dropped CGM values will be interpolated over short time periods, 
using capi[INVESTIGATOR_412586]. In the event of ≥10% missingness in either 
subject data or CGM values, we will analyze outcomes under m ultiple imputation to compensate 
for potential bias.  
Additional considerations for selected secondary endpoints:  The number of carbohydrate 
treatments will be modeled using model (1) above with Poisson regression for count data. The 
coefficient of variatio n of glucose is non -normal without an obvious probability distribution, so 
that bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_412587]. Data for percent of time with 
sensed glucose <54 mg/dl may be sparse; if so, we will present counts of events wher e glucose 
went below this level, counting as separate events when the time between them is ≥ 30 minutes.   
Confidentiality and Protection of Human Participants  
RISKS and BENEFITS  
Risks:  The risks of the protocol procedures are considered minor. Nonetheless , since pumps and 
sensors used within automated glucose control systems are imperfect, there is a risk for 
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. All studies will issue alerts and will be remote monitored 
during each visit with unserviced alerts being pushed to t he study coordinator and investigator. A 
study investigator will be on call at all times.  
Risks from exercise include falls, sprains, bruises, very low risk of bone fractures and head 
trauma. The likelihood of significant harm is quite low.  
Rarely, there  can be allergic responses to insulin, such as skin redness, hives, itching of the skin, 
swelling of the mouth, or breathing difficulties. The se reactions are considered very unlikely.  
The following events have been identified as possible anticipated devic e-related adverse events 
of Dexcom G6 sensor insertion and wear:  
• Excessive pain or discomfort from either system deployment or during wear period (8 or 
greater on a 10 -point Likert scale)  
• Excessive bleeding, defined as requires removal of the device to st op bleeding  
• Hematoma, defined as induration at the sensor insertion location (ecchymosis is a known 
consequence of needle skin puncture or pressure from sensor pod and will not be captured 
as an AE)  
• Edema from sensor and/or adhesive tape that is significan t and non -resolving within 48 
hours of sensor pod removal  
• Erythema from sensor and/or adhesive tape that is significant and non -resolving within 48 
hours of sensor pod removal  
IRB [ZIP_CODE] version 6         [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   May 21 , 2021  
21 
 • Local infection, defined as presence of pus at either sensor wire or sensor pod site  
• Sensor or introducer needle fracture during insertion/wear/removal For this reason, the 
study investigator will inspect each removed sensor for the possibility of breakage or 
fracture. Any evidence of sensor breakage will be recorded and reported to FDA and the 
sensor company . 
 
Benefits:  The participant may not directly benefit from being in this study; however, their 
participation may help to advance automated insulin delivery technology.  
 
COSTS :

(Seoul, 2008), and 64th (Brazil, 2013) General Assemblies. The investigator will ensure that the 
study described in this protocol is conducted in full conformance with tho se principles, the 
protocol, current FDA regulations, ICH Good Clinical Practices (GCP) guidelines, Good 
Laboratory Practices (GLP) guidelines, local ethical and regulatory requirements, including the 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, U.S. applicable Co de of Federal Regulations (title 21), 
any IEC requirements relative to clinical studies.  
Should a conflict arise, the investigator will follow whichever law or guideline affords the 
greater protection to the individual participant. The investigator will a lso ensure thorough 
familiarity with the appropriate use and potential risks of use of the study device, as described in 
this protocol, prior to the initiation of the study.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
At all study visits, study staff will determine if any ad verse events (AEs) have occurred. Disease 
related events that are chronic in nature and occur as part of the progression of the diabetes disease 
state (i.e. diagnoses of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) will not be captured as adverse 
events in th is study. Hypo - and hyperglycemia will not be considered AEs unless participant has

23 
 positive ketones or displays symptoms of hypoglycemia such as: loss of consciousness, slurred 
speech, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54812].   
One of the investigators wil l write up a description of the adverse event/unanticipated problem. 
All reportable new information (RNI) will be reported to the IRB within five calendar days after 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_54813]. RNI is any information that might meet the regulatory definiti on of an 
unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others or serious or continuing noncompliance 
that might impact the criteria for IRB approval. The report will be submitted to the IRB by [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_80721]. A summa ry of all UP's and adverse events, including 
those that do not meet the requirement for RNI, will be submitted with the continuing review. All 
AEs will be monitored until adequately resolved or stable.  Information regarding AEs that occur 
during the study will be entered into appropriate CRFs. Such information will include, at a 
minimum:  
• Date of event  
• Severity  
• Outcome  
• Resolution of event  
 
Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any clinically significant undesirable experience (sign, symptom, illness, or other  
medical event) meeting the causality definition above that appears or worsens in a participant 
during a clinical study. A clinically significant event is any event (sign, symptom, lab/imaging 
abnormality, or diagnosis) that is noteworthy enough to merit d ocumentation in standard medical 
records (e.g. history and physical, progress notes, clinic visit notes, etc.). Other non -clinically 
significant events (e.g. colds, minor headaches, etc.) may be documented on the comments CRF. 
Mild hypoglycemia is expected  in persons with diabetes using insulin and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_115216] -
limiting in nature; thus, this will not be captured as an AE. The Medical Monitor will have the 
final say in determining the causality. Adverse events that continue after the participant’s 
discontinuation or completion of the study will be followed until their medical outcome is 
determined or until no further change in the condition is expected.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening; ( substantial risk of dying at the time of the adverse event or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_412588] a participant’s death  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153830]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  
Exceptions to the SAE de finition will include the following:  
• Elective surgery  
IRB [ZIP_CODE] version 6         [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   May 21 , 2021  
24 
 • A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing condition, without a serious deterioration in 
health  
Any SAE, including death, due to any cause (related or unrelated to the device), that may occur 
during a c linical study will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_412589] (within 1 
working day of learning of the event).  
 
Severity of Adverse Events  
The following definitions may be used to rate severity of AEs:  
• Mild  
Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of minor irritant type that is 
outside the norm for the disease state or subject; causing no loss of time from normal 
activities; symptoms would not require medication or a medical evaluation; signs and 
symptoms are transient. Mild hy poglycemia is expected in diabetes and will not be 
captured as an AE.   
Example:  ketosis not requiring an ER visit.  
• Moderate  
Discomfort severe enough to cause interference with usual activities, requiring treatment 
due to cognitive impairment, by [CONTACT_412615]: hypoglycemia with inability to self -treat, requiring third party assistance for 
treatment and/or an emergency room visit.  
• Severe  
Incapacitating, causing inability to do work or usual activities; signs and symptoms may 
be of systemic nature or require medical evaluation and/or treatment at a health care 
facility  
Example:  hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness or seizure involvement  
Relationship of Adverse Events to Study or Study Device  
The investigator will categorize the relationship of the event to the study or study device as 
follows:  
• Not Related  
AE is due to an underlying disease state or concomitant medication or therapy not related 
to the device, disease or study.  
• Unlikely Related  
AE has minimum or no temporal relationship to the study device, disease or study 
participation and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
• Possibly Related  
AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study device, disease or study procedures 
and al ternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential relationship to 
the device, disease or study.  
• Probably Related  
IRB [ZIP_CODE] version 6         [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   May 21 , 2021  
25 
 AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study device, disease or study and another 
etiology is unlikely.  
• Definitely R elated  
AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study device, study procedures or disease 
and another etiology does not exist.  
Unanticipated Problems  
Unanticipated problems, including study, disease or device -related problems will be detected by 
[CONTACT_80749] -approved 
research protocol and the current IRB approved consent form, any underlying disease or 
conditions of the subject experiencing the adverse event, a careful assessmen t of whether the 
adverse event is related or possibly related to the subject’s participation in the study or if root 
cause or associations is with study devices.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is not expected to occur. An UADE is defined as 
any serious  adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by 
– or associated with – the device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in 
nature, sev erity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan (including documents such as 
the protocol, the informed consent document, other study -related documents), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with the device that relates to the ri ghts, safety, or 
welfare of participants.   
During the review of a reported SAE, if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_412590], and 
the event was classifie d as, ‘possibly related’ to the device, the event will be documented as an 
UADE. If the event is classified as an UADE, the Investigator must notify the IRB and Dexcom 
will notify the FDA within ten (10) working days of the original SAE notification.  
If determined that the UADE presents an unreasonable risk to participants, we will terminate all 
investigations or parts of investigations presenting that risk as soon as possible, but not later than 
[ADDRESS_520145] Reportable Events/MDR Reporting  
A device issue, whether related to a complaint or not, is an allegation from the participant or 
study personnel regarding an indication of the failure of a device to meet user expectations for 
quality or performance specifications. Device issues will be recorded onto appropriate CRFs by 
[CONTACT_8786]. The CGM and Omnipod devices a re currently marketed. Therefore, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_412591].   
MDR reportable events are events that manufacturers become aware of that reasonably suggest 
one of their marke ted devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has 
malfunctioned and the malfunction of the device would likely cause or contribute to a death or 
serious injury if the malfunction were to recur (21 CFR 803.3).

 Confidentiality P rocedures:  
To protect confidentiality, standard institutional practices will be followed as described in the 
OHSU Information Security and Research Data Resource Guide 
(http://ozone.ohsu.edu/cc/sec/isg/res_sec.pdf) to maintain the confidentiality and secur ity of data 
collected in this study. Study staff will be trained regarding these procedures. See IRB protocol 
[ADDRESS_520146] will be stored in OCTRI's installation of REDCap, a highly secure and 
robust web -based research data collection and management system. Features of REDCap that 
protect participants' privacy and data security include:  
• Physical Security: OCTRI's REDCap software is housed on servers located in ITG's 
Advanced Computing Center providing locked physical security.  
• Electronic Security: The REDCap servers are housed behind both the OHSU firewall and 
a second ACC firewall.   All transmissions of data from the application are encrypted over 
HTTPS with the industry standard TLS 1.1 protocol (AES 256 -bit encryption).   
• Controlled User Access: REDCap is employs a robust multi -level security system that 
enables researchers to easily implement "minimum necessary" data access for their 
research staff, including specification of data fields that are identifiers. This feature 
includes “single click” ability to provide completely deidentified (removing all identified 
data fields and shifting dates) for analysis or other purposes.   User activities are logged to 
enable auditing of all data access.    Access is integrated with OHSU' s network such that 
users who are also OHSU employees are authenticated against their OHSU network 
credentials.    
• Data Integrity: REDCap is jointly managed in accordance with OHSU Information 
Security Directives by [CONTACT_311460]'s Biomedic al Informatics 
Program, ensuring fidelity of database configuration and back -ups.  User activities are 
logged to enable auditing of all data changes.  
Paper files will be stored in locked filing cabinets in restricted access offices at OHSU. After the 
study , source documents will be maintained at the participating clinical center (or offsite record 
storage facilities) 2 years after a marketing application is approved for our group's decision 
support device or discontinuance of pursuit of marketing approval.

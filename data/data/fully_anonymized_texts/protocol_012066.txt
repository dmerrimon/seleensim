Recently, the quality of generic metoprolol extended -release (ER) products has been 
called  into question with reports of inconsistent effects when switching from the brand 
name [CONTACT_861521] a generic formulation. Problems with bioequivalence could have serious 
and widespread consequences given the high frequency of metoprolol ER use in the 
manage ment of various cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, coronary heart 
disease, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. We hypothesize that both product - and 
patient -specific factors lead to variability in the pharmacokinetics and clinical respon se to 
different metoprolol ER formulations. The study objective is to provide the 
pharmacokinetic and clinical response data necessary to inform optimal bioequivalence 
metrics and criteria for generic metoprolol ER products to ensure availability of high 
quality generic alternatives.  We will conduct a prospective, randomized, crossover trial of 
brand name [CONTACT_861522]. Responses will be compared between c ytochrome P450 ( CYP) 2D6 extensive 
and poor  to intermediate  metabolizers so that the impact of CYP2D6  genotype on variable 
pharmacokinetics and clinical responses with metoprolol ER products can be determi ned. 
Responses will also be compared between patients taking and not taking a proton pump 
inhibitor for their clinical care given potential effects of a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_861455].  
Following treatment with each metoprolol ER formulation, the patient will  complete a [ADDRESS_1200774] commonly

 Introduction:  
 
Background:  
Metoprolol ranks among the top five most commonly prescribed medications, with an 
estimated [ADDRESS_1200775] -
myocardial infarction  based on evidence that it reduces mortality and morbidity in t hese 
populations .2-4 The extended -release (ER) formulation  of metoprolol was  approved in 
[ADDRESS_1200776] 3 products are currently marketed b y 
various manufacturers:  [CONTACT_23015]’s Laboratories, Inc (India), Mylan Inc (Canonsburg, 
PA), and Actavis PLC (Formerly Watson, Parsippany, NJ ). The availability of generic 
metoprolol ER offers a more affordable alternative for patients requiring β -blocker 
therapy. H owever, bioequivalence is essential to ensure that the quality of the generic 
product is similar to that of the brand name [CONTACT_231517].   
The manufacturer of a generic product must provide data to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) showing that th e generic is bioequivalent to the brand name 
[CONTACT_231517]. Bioequivalence is used as a surrogate for therapeutic equivalence and is defined 
under the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Part 320 (21 C.F.R. §320).  The FDA 
proposes a two -pronged approach for te sting bioequivalence consisting of in vitro  
dissolution testing and in vivo  pharmacokinetic studies of the active substance. For the 
latter, two products are considered bioequivalent when any differences in the rate or 
extent of bioavailability of the acti ve moiety are viewed as clinically insignificant (usually 
within 80% to 125% of the branded product).5,6 Cross -over studies in healthy volunteers, 
where single doses of the reference and generic products are administered at the same 
labeled strength and under similar testing conditions, with quantification of area under the 
plasma concentration time curve (A UC) and peak plasma concentration (C max), are the 
most frequently used in-vivo studies to establish bioequivalence, and this is what is 
recommended in the FDA’s draft guidance for bioequivalence studies for metoprolol.[ADDRESS_1200777] the risk for adverse events following generic 
substitution . A previous formulation of metoprolol ER (manufactured by [CONTACT_516786]. ) 
was removed from the market after the FDA discovered failures in the process validation 
studies for metop rolol succinate tablets and variability among lots.  The FDA recently 
issued a warning letter to  Wockhardt Ltd , another manufacturer of generic metoprolol ER, 
Page [ADDRESS_1200778] 3 dissolution 
media (e.g. pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8 buffers) to demonstrate that the drug is stable in  acidic 
stomach conditions and will release in the intestine.[ADDRESS_1200779] 
the bioavailability of metoprolol.  O-demethylation via the cytochrome P450 2D6 
(CYP2D6) enzyme is the principal route of metoprolol metabolism, with metabolites 
having no significant β -blocking effect.13 The gene for CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic, with 
over 100 alleles defined (http://www.cypalleles.ki.se). The CYP2D6*1  and *2 alleles are 
associated with normal enzyme activity.  Individuals with one or two copi[INVESTIGATOR_861456] (EMs). The *9, *10, *17 , *29, and 
*41 alleles occur secondary to nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
and lead to a reduction in enzyme activity. The *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *11, and *15 alleles 
are examples of loss -of-function alleles that occur secondary to frameshift mutations ( *3, 
*6), splicing defects ( *4), gene deletion ( *5), or other mutations.  Individuals with one loss -
of-function and one reduced -function allele are intermedia te metabolizers (IMs), while 
those with two copi[INVESTIGATOR_861457] -of-function alleles (e.g. *3 /*4) are poor metabolizers (PMs).  
At the opposite extreme, duplication or multiplication of functional alleles confers the ultra -
rapid metabolizer (UM) phenotype with marked  increases in CYP2D6 activity. 
Frequencies of commonly described  
Page 9 of 41 
 CYP2D6  alleles are shown in Table 1 .  There is 
marked ethnic variability in the prevalence of 
CYP2D6 phenotypes, with the prevalence of 
PMs ranging from 0 -10% and UMs ranging from 
0-29%. In a multi -ethnic clinical trial population 
with hypertension, we found that 5% of 
participants were PMs, 7% were IMs, and 4% 
were UMs.[ADDRESS_1200780] that CYP2D6  genotype/phenotype may not significantly impact 
BP or adverse responses to metoprolol but may impact the HR response, and so may be 
important for some in dications.14,16-[ADDRESS_1200781] drug, differences in dissolution rate/absorption may impact the absolute 
bioavailability, and these differences in first pass eff ect between products may also differ 
by [CONTACT_097]2D6  genotype.  The effect of CYP2D6 genotype on the bioequivalence of 
metoprolol products has not been examined and thus is important to define.  
 
Significance:  
Over [ADDRESS_1200782] established expertise in 
pharmacokinetic and p harmacodynamics studies of metoprolol and other β -blockers in 
patients with hypertension and heart failure; pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
modeling; clinical trial research in the hypertensive and heart failure populations; and 
pharmacogenomics resear ch. We believe our experience and publications strongly 
support our application and well position us to identify factors impacting bioequivalence 
and causing variability in response to ER metoprolol products.

Objectives:  
 
Metoprolol  succinate is widely used in the management of heart diseases and is available 
in generic formulations. However, t here are mounting data suggesting potential issues 
with the  bioequivalence and therapeutic equivalence of different generic metoprolol ER 
products, which could compromise clinical outcomes and impact the risk for adverse 
events with generic substitution. Studies used to establish bioequivalence between brand 
name [CONTACT_861523]  [ADDRESS_1200795] of CYP2D6  
genotype on variable pharmacokinetics and clinical responses with metoprolol ER 
products.

Background  (past findings and relevant literature) :   
 
The research team has substantial experience with clinical pharmacokineti c and 
pharmacodynamic studies.  The research team has significant experience studying β -
blockers, including research in healthy volunteers and patients with hypertension, heart 
failure and ischemic heart disease and comprising assessment of numerous clinical 
responses, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics.   Data from 
selected publications relevant to the proposal herein are described below.

 Comparison of metoprolol formulations in a heart failure population and 
relationship of clinical responses to pharmacokinetics.  Based on questions at the 
time regarding differences in clinical outcomes for heart failure patients treated wit h 
immediate release (IR) versus ER metoprolol, we conducted a crossover study to 
evaluate possible mechanisms for the perceived differences in clinical out comes by 
[CONTACT_861493] .[ADDRESS_1200796] crossover study of equal total daily doses of the IR (generic 
metoprolol tartrate) and ER 
metoprolol ( Toprol XL® ) 
formulations.  After 3 -week 
treatment with each formulation, 
patients un derwent pharmacokinetic 
evaluation at various time points 
during the dosing interval, 24 hour 
ambulatory BP monitoring, and 24 -
hour Holter monitoring.  Metoprolol 
IR concentrations exceeded those of 
the ER formulati on approximately 
60% of the time , as shown in Figure 
1.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], both systolic and 
diastolic BPs were significantly lower 
for metoprolol ER versus IR over the 
entire 24 -hr period  (Figure 2, left 
panel) . These data demonstrate that 
the antihypertensive effects of metoprolol are unrela ted to plasma drug concentration.  
These findings are consistent with our previous observation s in patients with 
hypertension .22  An explanation for the poor plasma concentration -response relationship 
may be due to the sigmoidal nature of the concentration  response curve for β -blockers. 
Specifically, once maximal antihypertensive response is achieved (E max), concentrations 
above this level do not result in any additional BP lowering effect.  
 
We also observed greater HR vari ability with the ER formulation21. Mean 24 -hr HR was 
similar between groups. However, the high to total frequency ratio (high -frequency HR 
variability) and the high to low frequency ratio were significantly greater  with metoprolol 
ER ve rsus IR. The low to total frequency ratio (low -frequency HR variability) was 
significantly lower for the ER formulation. These data are consistent with increased 
parasympathetic activity and decreased sympathetic activity (indicated by [CONTACT_861494] -
frequency HR variability) with metoprolol ER compared to IR. Reduced HR variability is 
an independent risk factor for incre ased mortality in heart failure.23-25  Evidence that 
metoprolol ER is associated with inc reased HR variability suggests that this mechanism 
may contribute to the greater survival benefits observed with metoprolol ER over 
metoprolol IR in patients with heart failure. Importantly, the differences in HR variability 
were observed despi[INVESTIGATOR_861459] 2 4-hr HRs between products, indicating that HR variability 
is a better discriminator of clinical benefits between β -blockers.    
Figure 1. Comparison of plasma concentration time 
curves for metoprolol IR ( MIR, open circles) and 
metoprolol ER ( MXL, black circles)  
Page [ADDRESS_1200797] 
that response rates to β -blocker therapy differ depending o n the clinical response 
studied26. We initiated m etoprolol in patients with hypertension, with clinic BP, ambulatory 
BP monitoring, and exercise treadmill testing assessed before and after treatment. 
Patients were classified as respo nders or nonresponders to metoprolol if the diastolic BP 
decreased by ≥10% or <10%, respectively.  When classified based on clinic BP response, 
71% of patients were considered responders to metoprolol. However, only 47% met this 
definition based on ambulat ory data. In addition, BP response to metoprolol was not 
predictive of HR response.  As shown in Figure 3 , both responders and nonresponders 
to metoprolol based on BP data, had significant reductions in HR, whether measured at 
Figure 2. The left panel shows comparison of 24 -hr (A) systolic blood pressure and (B) diastolic  blood 
pressure between metoprolol IR (MIR, open circles) and metoprolol ER (MXL, black circles).  Right 
panel shows comparison of (A) high to total frequency variability ratios and (B) low to total frequency 
variability ratios for metoprolol IR (MIR, open  circles) and ER (MXL, closed circles).    
Page [ADDRESS_1200798] 
that patients with little to no BP reduction 
with metopr olol may still derive significant 
benefit from β -blocker management of 
disease where HR reduction is important, 
such as in atrial fibrillation, heart failure, 
and ischemic heart disease. Overall, 
these data highlight the importance of 
assessing multiple cl inical endpoints to 
clearly define response to metoprolol.   
 
Clinical response to metoprolol by 
[CONTACT_097]2D6 genotype .  As part of the PEAR -
2 study, we examined the influence of 
CYP2D6  genotype on the efficacy and 
tolerability of metoprolol tartrate in a 
subset of 281 patients, including 73 
enrolled from UF .27 The CYP2D6*2, *3, *4, *6, *10, *17 , and *41 alleles were detected via 
PCR and pyrosequencing using a PSQ HS96A SNP reagent kit. Additionally, copy 
number variation was estimated by [CONTACT_861495] (Life Technologies) 
and a pyrosequencing -based method27. Quantification of CYP2D6  gene copy number 
was performed using CopyCaller Software (Applied Biosystems). Phenotypes we re 
assigned based on genotype. Poor and intermediate metabolizers were found to have 
significantly greater HR response to metoprolol, consistent with these CYP2D6 
phenotypes being the ones that result in the highest plasma drug concentrations  (Figure 
4). In contrast, these impaired metabolism phenotypes were not associated with 
differences in the BP response or tolerability/adverse effects to metoprolol.  Based on 
these data, we will enroll both PMs and IMs to compare against EMs.     
 
The lack of difference in BP and adverse responses is consistent with previous reports 
from our laboratory on metoprolol pharmacokinetics and response in heart fa ilure and 
hypertensive patients .28, [ADDRESS_1200799] recent report, in both of th e previous 
studies we showed the expected differences in S-metoprolol concentration by [CONTACT_097]2D6 
phenotype, but did not show differences in tolerability or response to metoprolol. 
Collectively, these data (and others in the literature for metoprolol and CYP2D 6) suggest 
that CYP2D6  genotype -derived phenotype is associated with dramatic differences in 
metoprolol pharmacokinetics and yet these differences translate into minimal differences 
in efficacious or adverse responses to the drug, with HR being the one res ponse 
phenotype with a possible difference by [CONTACT_097]2D6  genotype .30, [ADDRESS_1200800]. Johnson

Clinic.  PEAR enrolled 1701 patients, of 
whom 768 met all inclusion criteria and 
completed all aspects of the approximately 6 
month clinical trial. PEAR -2 was recently 
completed (March 20 14) and enrolled [ADDRESS_1200801] complete metoprolol response data 
on 108 (the remaining 19 had a β -blocker 
contraindication  and so were only studied on 
chlorthalidone).  We have call -back 
information on these patients, and based on 
our [ADDRESS_1200802] established excellen t rapport with these 
patients. In the PEAR trial (for which we 
studied atenolol), we studied β -blocker 
response in [ADDRESS_1200803] patients based on CYP2D6 genotype, 
which is available from the PEAR studies, and clinical use of a p roton pump inhibitor.  
Study Design and Methods:  
 
Study design .  This will be a randomized, cross -over study of equal doses of different 
formulations of metoprolol succinate : Toprol XL , brand name [CONTACT_861524] ; [CONTACT_110229]’s,  generic metoprolol succinate product 1 (Gx metoprolol ER 1);  and Actavis , 
generic metoprolol succinate product  2 (Gx metoprolol ER 2)  in hypertensive patients  as 
Figure 4.  Median (IQR) clinical responses to 
metoprolol based on CYP2D6 phenotype.  
Shown are changes in (a) heart rate, (b) 
systolic BP, and (c) diastolic BP from 
baseline.   
Page [ADDRESS_1200804] shown in our formulation crossover study 
that this is a sufficient period to document difference between formulations.21   
 
Study population and eligibility requirements . The primary target for recruitment will 
be participants from the recently completed PEAR -1 and PEAR -2 studies who were 
recruited  from the UF site and provided call -back information.  
 
Inclusion criteria  to enroll study particip ants include:  
 Age 18 -years  or older  
 Diagnosed with Essential Hypertension  
 
Patients will be targeted  for enrollment based on current treatment of their hypertension 
with a β -blocker or known tolerability to a β -blocker based on their previous participation 
in the PEAR studies. If necessary to meet enrollment targets, additional patients will be 
recruited  from the patient population in the UF Health Family Medicine  – Hampton Oaks 
clinic  at UF , UF HealthStreet, UF  Integrated Data Repository (IDR) , Oak Hammock and 
through advertisements placed in local classified services.  More detailed recruitment 
methods are described below under “Subject Selection and Recruitment”.  Patients 
enrolled in the PEAR studies provided consent for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and most of those from 
PEAR -[ADDRESS_1200805] been genotyped for CYP2D6  variants . Participants with the PM, IM, or EM 
phenotype will  be enrolled based on CYP2D6  genotype -derived phenotype. We anticipate 
that 40% to 60% of patients enrolled will be taking a proton pump inhibitor for clinical care , 
which will be taken into account in the data analysis . 
 
Exclusion criteria : These criteria  match those of PEAR studies  and include the following:  
Figure 5.  Study design

non β -blocker, anti -hypertensives and other drug therapy will be allowed as long as 
therapy is held constant duri ng study participation  
 
Additional contraindications , which pertain to administration of the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_861463] 2, include  a histor y of any of the following, as documented in the electronic health 
record :

Page 19 of 41 
 Protoco l. The protocol is described in detail below. Patients will be randomized at the 
baseline visit to one of two groups using  the blocked randomization method with a block 
size of 4 : 
 Study group A 
 Study group B 
 
Both study arms consist of [ADDRESS_1200806] phase /period  for all participants . The rationale for this is that 
the problems with the generic formulation are reported after the switch from the brand 
name [CONTACT_861525].  Thus, we want to capture the switch from brand name [CONTACT_861526].   
 
Screening visit.  Patients will be asked to come to the UF Clinical Translational Science 
Institute (CTSI) located in the Clinical Translational Research Building  in Gainesville.      
After obtaining written, informed consent, the following will be done:  
 Demographics, med ical history and concomitant medication will be obtained,  
 Vitals, Height and weight will be collected.  
 The study nurse will draw  15 m L of blood total.  10 m L (2 teaspoonful) of venous blood 
for a basic metabolic panel, AST, and ALT and 5 m L (1 teaspoonful) of venous blood 
for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  A urine pregnancy test will be done for women of childbearing 
potential . 
In the absence of exclusion criteria from medical history , vitals  and lab results, patients 
will be scheduled for the enrollment study visit within 2 weeks .    
 
Enrollment  visit.  The enrollment  visit will be conducted in the UF Health Family Medicine 
- Hampton Oaks clinic in Gainesville.   
 The study physician will perform a physical exam on each patient.    
 Patients meeting inclusion criteria will be randomized to study group A or study group 
B using a  block randomi zation with a block size of 4.  
 Patients will be provided with a supply of Toprol XL . There will be no washout phase. 
Patients taking metoprolol succinate will be asked  to stop taking their supply of drug 
and will be supplied with the same dose of the study  drug to take instead  for the 
duration of the study . The study physician may adjust metoprolol succinate doses up 
or down to achieve or maintain each patient's goal blood pressure. Patients taking a 
beta-blocker that is not metoprolol succinate on enrollment, will be switched to an 
“equivalent” Toprol XL  dose (i.e. 200 mg Toprol XL  daily for 100 mg atenolol daily; 
200 mg Toprol XL  daily for 50 mg carvedilol daily, etc.) , which will be determined by 
[CONTACT_861497].  The patient will be provided with up to 
a 2-week  supply of study  drug and asked to return once a week for a blood pressure 
check and additional  supply of study drug , if necessary,  until the first overnight 
pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) visit . Patients  not currently taking a β -
blocker will either have Toprol  XL added if not at goal BP, or Toprol XL  substituted for 
another antihypertensive medication. In either case, Toprol XL  will be started on 50 
mg/day.  This is within the recommended initial dose range in the drug labeling of 25 -
Page 20 of 41 
 100 mg/day. Toprol XL  will be provided by [CONTACT_21212]  (IDS) , and 
patients will be instructed to take their Toprol XL  dose at 9 A.M. each morning.  
 Patients will be asked to bring their study medication pi[INVESTIGATOR_861464].  
 Patients will be provided with a home BP monitor and appropriate sized cuff.  Patients 
from PEAR -[ADDRESS_1200807] before 
retiring in the evening daily (with the exception of overnight study visits) until the study 
is completed.     
 Patients will be instructed to contact t he study nurse  for a BP check  if their home BP 
monitor shows two consecutive resting BP measurements taken 5 minutes apart >170 
or <100 mmHg for SBP and/or >110 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP), or 
pulse <50 beats/minute at any time during the study. The dose will be reduced by [CONTACT_861498] a systolic BP <100, symptoms of hypotension, or pulse <50BPM following initiation 
of therapy. Home BP data will be collected using the Microlife 3 AC1 -PC (Minneapo lis 
MN), set in triplicate mode. Each activation of the device will lead to the measurement 
of BP in triplicate, and the HR and BP readings are electronically recorded and time -
stamped. The data will then be downloaded by [CONTACT_861499] ( CRC ) for BP checks during dose 
titration or for overnight studies.

a: Includes up to 3 weekly visits for dose titration to 100 mg  
 qd, 150 mg qd, and 200 mg qd as tolerated or until BP <140/[ADDRESS_1200809] of treatment with Toprol XL  for 7 to 28 days.  The range in 
duration of Phase 1 is to allow for -blocker up -titration if needed to achieve a BP < 140/[ADDRESS_1200810] overnight visit.   Patients not on a β -
blocker prior to the study (i.e. patients starting Toprol XL  50 mg/day) will be asked to 
come to the CRC  in the Clinical and Transl ational Research Building ( CTRB ) each week 
for a BP check and dose titration to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day or BP <140/[ADDRESS_1200811] one titration visit, documenting BP < 140/[ADDRESS_1200812] PK/PD study visit. This optimized dose will be used for all PK -PD 
visits.  
 
Patients will be reminded at each visit to take their Toprol XL  dose at [ADDRESS_1200813] pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamics (PD) study  
visit. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_861465] .  
 
PK/PD stud y visit .  Subjects will be instructed to abstain from caffeine and alcohol 
beginning at [ADDRESS_1200814] (no 
food or beverage except water) beginning at 12 midnight  before the s tudy. Patients will 
be asked to wear and/or bring comfortable clothing and shoes suitable for walking on a 
treadmill. Patients will arrive  to the CTSI CRC  or at Shands Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_861466] .   
The follow ing will be placed:   
 Holter monitor for determination of total 24 -hour heart beat and HR variability  
 ambulatory BP monitor for 24 -hour blood pressure  
 an indwelling venous catheter for a [ADDRESS_1200815] the unit until completion of the study  the 
following day. Patients will be given a SmartBar® (Given Imaging, Duluth GA)  
standardized meal to eat  before taking the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_861467] -prandial motility. 
Immediately afterward, participants will be asked to swallow a disposable SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® 
capsule (Given Imaging) , designed to continuously measure pH and motility as it moves 
through the gastroint estinal track until it is excreted.   
 
Patients w ill be provided  a regular diet, or any diet appropriate to their needs,  for 
the duration of the overnight stay . Patients will be given a similar type of diet  for each 
subsequent PK/PD visit to minimize any impact of meals on the pharmacokinetics of the 
metoprolol formulation.   b: Study week is dependent on duration of Toprol XL treatment in Phase 1, which many range from 7 to 28 days

erroneous or mis sing data collected during PK/PD Study Visit 1 (Phase 1). This repeated 
data collection will only be necessary if there were errors in heart rate variability or 
ambulatory blood pressure data collection during Phase 1, and the patient agrees to wear 
the mo nitor(s) as an outpatient during Phase 3.  
 
Phase [ADDRESS_1200818] for Phase 4 , at the same dose as determined  in Phase 
1, followed by [CONTACT_861501]/PD studies.  After  the overnight PK/PD studies, 
patients taking metoprolol or any other  β-blocker prior to study enrollment will be placed 
back on their pre -study medication. On the other hand, p atients who were not on a β -
blocker before  study enrollment, will have the metoprolol dose reduced by 50%  initially 
as part of a weekly tapering regimen , and will be restarted on any medication that was 
withdrawn or dose adjusted on study enrollment . 
 
Follow -up study procedures .  Patients will be scheduled for a follow up visit for a BP check 
at the CRC one week after the last overnight study visit.  Patients will be asked to return 
the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ® data recorder to the study nurse at th is visit . Patients who are undergoing 
a metoprolol taper will ha ve their metoprolol dose reduced by 50% each week until 
completely withdrawn, with an outpatient visit for a BP check scheduled with each dose 
reduction. Patients will be asked to continue to measure BP in the A.M. and P.M. and to 
call the study nurse  for a BP check in the CTSI  if two consecutive resting SBP 
measurements  are above 170 or below 100 mmHg, and/or DBP measurements are 
above [ADDRESS_1200819] 5 minutes apart, or pulse below 50 BPM .  The 
study nurse will call the patient  between 3 to 5 weeks after the final overnight study visit 
for a safety check , which will includ e asking about home BP readings and the occurrence 
Page 24 of 41 
 of any adverse effects. This will end the patient ’s study participation. Patients may keep 
the home blood pr essure monitor after the study for their personal use.  
    
Detailed de scription of PK/PD study procedures:  
 
Ambulatory BP monitoring .  On admission to the CRU, patients will be fitted with a 
SpaceLabs [ZIP_CODE] OnTrak  ambulatory BP monitor (Spacelabs Healthcare, Snoqualmie, 
WA) and a MindWare Mobile Cardio/GSR holter monitor (MindWare   Technologies LTD, 
Gahanna, OH).  The ambulatory BP monitor will be programmed to randomly measure 
BP 4 times per hour during the day (6 A.M.-11 P.M.) and 2 times per hour during the 
nighttime (11 P.M.-6 A.M.), as in previous trials .21,19,34,35   
 
Pharmacokinetic studies .  The metoprolol dose will be administered between 8 A.M and 
12 P.M .  A 6-ml blood sample will be drawn from the venous catheter into EDTA  collection 
tubes at the following times: immediately before the dose  (baseline) , and at 30 mins  5 
mins, 60 mins  5 mins , 2 hrs  10 mins,  3 hrs  10 mins , 4 hrs  10 mins , 6 hrs  20 
mins , 8 hrs  20 mins , 12 hrs  30 mins , 16 hrs  30 mins , 20 hrs  30 mins , and 24 hrs 
 30 mins  after the dose.  A total of 72 mls ( almost 5  tablespoonfuls) of  blood will be 
drawn from the catheter  during the overnight study visit .  Blood will be immediately 
centrifuged, and the plasma separated and stored at -20ºC or -80 ºC until analysis. 
Metoprolol enantiomer concentrations will be determined by a validated chiral high -
performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method, modified based 
on a f luorescence detection method pr eviously published by [CONTACT_27156] .22  
 
pH monitoring.  The SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® Capsule and GI Monitoring System offers a noninvasive, 
nonradioactive, well tolerated means of assessing gastrointestinal pH and motility.  The 
SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_861468], single -use capsule and is FDA -cleared to aid in the evaluation 
of gastrointestinal motility conditions.  As it moves through the GI tract, it wirelessly and 
continuously transmits data to a recorder worn on the belt or lanyard for up to [ADDRESS_1200820]. Estores (Co-Investigator)  has 
extensive experience in gastrointestinal and esophageal pH monito ring via a number of 
techniques .36-[ADDRESS_1200821] relevant to this proposal,  he has experience with wireless capsule 
systems to monitor pH in both the  research and clinical settings .36,40  Immediately after 
ingesting a SmartBar ®, participants will be given a SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ® capsule  to swallow, and 
fitted with the wireless Data Recorder to wear on a belt or lanyard until the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ® 
capsule  passes with a regular bowel movement.   The participant will be discharged with 
the Data Recorde r to be worn at all times except while bathing or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The recorder 
should be removed while bathing and placed close by [CONTACT_236666].  While 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the participant will be instructed to place the data recorder under the pi[INVESTIGATOR_861469] a n ightstand by [CONTACT_236667].  The SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ® is expected to pass within 5 days of ingestion, 
and participants will be asked to return the Data Recorder at th e next scheduled study 
visit.  
 
Exercise treadmill .   Patients will undergo submaximal graded exercise tes ting to 
gradually reach 85% of their maximum predicted exercise HR calculated as:  0.85 * (220 -
age).  A [ADDRESS_1200822] between readings. Treadmill exercise will 
begin at 1.7 mph with a 0% incline.  The speed and slope of the incline will be increased 
as shown below.

 The study will be conducted in the UF Health Family Medicine – Hampton Oaks clinic for 
the enrollment visit, UF CRC in the CTRB for the screening  visit, and the CRC or  UF 
Healt h Shands Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_861472]/PD studies .  
 
Subject Selection and Recruitment:  
Subjects will be recruited among participants in the recently completed 
Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses -2 (PEAR -2) study from t he 
University of [LOCATION_012] site.  Participants in PEAR -2 previously provided a genetic sample, 
and the target population will be selected based on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 
genotype, targeting at least 10 patients with the PM or IM genotype and remained of 
patients  with the EM genotype. Participants will be targeted for enrollment based on 
current treatment of their hypertension (HTN) with a β -blocker, or known tolerability to a 
β-blocker based on their previous participation in PEAR -2. 
   
Inclusion of Women  and Minorities : The investigators have no planned limitations to 
enrollment based on race or ethnicity.  However, based on the population demographics 
of the PEAR -2 study, from which subjects will be recruited, the subjects will primarily be 
non-Hispanic whites or African Americans.  Specifically, the PEAR -2 subjects enrolled 
from the University of [LOCATION_012] site were 58% whites, 43% African Americans, and 3% 
Hispanics.  We anticipate enrolling 50 subjects with a similar number of men and women 
and similar e thnic and racial representation as subjects from PEAR -2.   
 
Strategies/Procedures for Recruitment .  Many strategies will be used for recruitment: 1.) 
Patients  in the PEAR -[ADDRESS_1200825] in study participation.  
If a sufficient number of patients cannot be recruited through the PEAR -1 and PEAR -2 
studies, patients with hypertension will be recruited by [CONTACT_861502]:  2.) The 
UF Health Family Medicine – Hampton Oaks clinic via an IRB-approved flyer placed in 
clinic waiting rooms and clinical rooms.  3.) HealthStreet wi ll be an additional mechanism 
for patient recruitment.  HealthStreet will be provided with a n IRB -approved  flyer and 
information to give to participants that may be interested in the study.  Potentially 
interested patients may call a number provided on the postcard.    4.) Potential participants 
will also be identified by [CONTACT_861503] -funded i2b2 tool, 
which provides  UF researchers access to a HIPAA -compliant and IRB-approved data s et. 
Our query  for the i2b2 data s et will identify cohort s that meet our inclusion and exclusion 
criteria . 5.) Advertisements will be placed with  classified advertisements services 
including “Craigslist”, “The Gainesville Sun”, and “Alligator” .  6.) Oak Hammock  will be 
provided with an IRB -approved flyer and information to give to participants that may be 
interested in the study. Potentially interested patients may call a number provided on the 
flyer.

Candidates who express interest in study participation will be invited to the UF Health 
Family Medicine - Hampton Oaks clinic to meet with the study team and further discuss 
the details of participation. At this visit, the study objectives , procedures, and risks of 
participation will be explained in detail.  After the candidate has been given  an opportunity 
to ask questions, the candidate will be asked to sign the informed consent form, which 
will contain language appropriate to satisfy the rules and regulations surrounding HIPAA 
requirements.  The signed informed consent will become part of t he subject’s medical 
record and will serve as documentation of the patient ’s willingness to participate. Patients  
will then be screened at the CRC  for exclusion criteria  (stated in the study population and 
eligibility criteria) based on a complete medical history , BP and HR assessment , and lab 
results.  Patients without exclusion criteria will be scheduled for the enrollment  study visit 
within [ADDRESS_1200827] metoprolol succinate doses up or down to 
achieve or maintain each patient's goal blood pressure. Patients taking a beta -blocker 
that is not metoprolol succ inate on enrollment, will be switched to an “equivalent” Toprol 
XL dose (i.e. 200 mg Toprol XL  daily for 100 mg atenolol  daily; 200 mg Toprol XL  daily for 
50 mg carvedilol daily, etc.) , which will be determined by [CONTACT_861504]. The patient will be provided with up to a [ADDRESS_1200828] overnight pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) 
visit. Patients not currently taking a β -blocker will either have Toprol XL  added if not at 
goal BP, or Toprol XL  substituted for another antihypertensive medication  upon 
physician’s discretion . In either case, Toprol XL  will be started at 50 mg/day.  This is 
within the recommended initial dose range in the drug labeling of 25 -100 mg/day. Toprol 
XL will be provided by [CONTACT_21212] (IDS), and patients will be 
instructed to take their Toprol XL dose at 9 A.M. each morning.  Dosage strength will be 
established during Phase 1 and will remain the same throughout the study duration.  If 
further blood pressure management is needed during the study, the study physician will 
be consulted.  
Risk/Benefit Ratio:  
Page 29 of 41 
 Potential Risks:  Risks are those associated with venipuncture, placement of an indwelling 
venous catheter, treatment with metoprolol, administration of the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] , exercise 
treadmill testing, and genetic information disclosure.  
i. Venipuncture. The risks of placing a catheter i n your arm for drawing blood include 
discomfort at the site of puncture; possible bruising and swelling around the puncture 
site; uncommonly, faintness from the procedure, and rarely an infection. The total 
amount of blood drawn during the entire study is 25 tablespoonsfuls (less than 1 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731]).  
ii. Metoprolol. Risks with metoprolol include hypotension (over response), continued 
HTN (under response), bradycardia, and worsening of asthma or bronchitis.  
Hypertension from under response increases the risk of acute coronary syndrome 
and stroke.  Metoprolol may also cause the side effects of fatigue, impotence, 
dizziness, light-headedness, drowsiness, lethargy, tiredness, depression, diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting, and vivid dreams.   
iii. SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_861473]. The risks associat ed with taking the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_861474]. These risks are greatest in patients with gastrointestinal 
obstruction or severe dsyphasgia, and such patients will be excluded from 
participation. If a SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_861475], there is a risk 
of damage to the GI tract. Subjects will be warned of this risk and the importance 
of avoiding an MRI until the capsule has passed.   
iv. BP monitoring.  There are no risks associated with wearing an ambulatory BP or 
Holter monitor.  However, these devices may be un comfortable and disturb sleep.  
v. Exercise treadmill testing.  Side effects of the exercise treadmill test can include 
shortness of breath, light headedness, hypotension, or abnormal heart rhy thm.  In 
rare cases, these side effects can be serious or life -threatening.  Medical staff 
trained in emergency response will be present for the studies.  Also possible are 
direct injuries such as bruises, sprains, and strains and indirect problems such as  
worsening of pain from arthritis.  
vi. Genetic study risks.  Genetic study risks include those related to confidentiality 
surrounding the genetic information and the chance that the genetic information 
could in some way expose the patient  to increased risk regarding employment or 
that future life, health, disability or long term care insurance providers could 
potentially use this genetic information to deny, limit or raise rates for insurance 
coverage.  
 
Potential Benefits  
 
Study participa tion may not result in any direct benefit for the participant. However, risks 
associated with participation are minimal, and there are potential societal benefits from 
this study.  Specifically, the results of this study may help the FDA better understand 
which factors should be considered in bioequivalence studies of metoprolol succinate, 
leading to safer and more effective generic alternatives.  
 
Alternative Treatment  
 
Page [ADDRESS_1200829] at risk for adverse effects 
with metoprolol  (e.g. patients with heart disease, bronchospastic disease) . Third, 
patients will undergo laboratory screening at baseline, and patients with elevated 
blood glucose, serum creatinine, or liver enzymes (ALT, AST) will also be exclude d 
to minimize risk . Regu lar laboratory testing is not part of standard of care with use 
of this long established drug, and thus will not be done after the initial screening. 
However, as an additional important measure of safety,  throughout the period of 
metoprolol therapy, patien ts will be encouraged to monitor their BP at home and 
report any SBP >180 mmHg  or <100 mm Hg, DBP >110 mm Hg , or HR <55 bpm .  
At each study visit, BP will be checked , home BP data will be assessed, and 
patients  will be evaluated for adverse effects, including symptoms of hypotension. 
Patients  experiencing intolerable adverse effects at any time will be discontinued 
from the study immediately. All study medication will be stopped, and patients will 
be placed back  on any blood pressure medications adjusted or stopped at the 
beginning of the study. The patient’s primary physician wi ll be contact[CONTACT_51095] -
up  
iii. Protections from SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_861453]. Patients with gastrointestinal obstruction or 
severe dsyphasgia, who ar e at the highest risk for capsule retention and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_861476].  Patients will be instructed to immediately report any unusual 
symptoms and will be warned of risk of damage to GI tract if an MRI is done before 
the capsule is passed.   
iv. Protections from exercise treadmill testing .  Medical staff trained in emergency 
response will be present for the studies.   
v. Protections against risks from genetic study participation.   Genetic testing results 
will not be provided to any of the patient s, and thus will not be included in the 
patient ’s medical record, and will not be available to insurance providers. All data 
will be stored in a secure, password protected database with access limited to key 
investigators only. All records will link only a cod e number and no patient specific 
identifiers will be used.  
 
Payment for Participation:  
Page 31 of 41 
  
Patients will receive a $[ADDRESS_1200830] at the completion of each overnight study 
visit and a $[ADDRESS_1200831] after the enrollment visit, screening visit, each outpatient 
visit need ed for medication adjustment  repeating, holter monitor on an outpatient basis, 
or repeating ambulatory blood pressure on an outpatient basis , for a total compensation 
up to $850 for patients completing all study procedures.   Parking at both the clinic and 
CTRB is free, and the patient will be provided with a home blood pressure monitor at 
the baseline visit, which they may keep after study participation ends.   
If a patient wi thdraws on his/her own before completing the 24 -hr PK and PD studies, or 
if the patient is withdrawn by [CONTACT_861505] 24 -hr PK and PD 
studies because of an adverse event or intolerance to the procedures, he/she will receive 
$75 for that study visit.  If the patient withdraws on his/her own or is withdrawn by [CONTACT_861506] 24 -hr PK/PD studies but before completing the exercise 
treadmill test, he/she will be compensated in the amount of $200.    
 
Patients will be responsible for paying income taxes on any payments provided by [CONTACT_861507] $[ADDRESS_1200832] report the amount received to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  
 
Adverse Event Reporting : 
 
Women of child bearing potential will be instructed to use an acceptable method of 
contraception  during study participation.  
Monitoring for documen tation of an adverse event, whether anticipated or unanticipated, 
is the responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_861477]. In 
term of SAF ETY monitoring, all adverse events spontaneously reported, elicited, or 
observed by [CONTACT_861508].  
 
All Serious Adverse Events, should they occur, whether study -related or expected, will be 
documented on a Case Report Form, under Adver se Event section in the Patient’s binder, 
reported by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_608377] (5) working days.  The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_861478]. All 
unanticipated, serious, fatal and/or life -threatening adverse events will be reported to the 
UF IRB. Aggregate reports of adverse events will be prepared on an annual basis or at 
the end of the study, whicheve r may occur earlier and forwarded to the IRB at annual 
review.  
 
In addition, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_236630] (FDA IRB) through the FDA 
Sponsor any unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects or others 45 CFR 
46.103(b)(5)(i). Per the RIHSC  definition , the following adverse events will be reported to 
the RIHSC within 10 working days of the discovery of the event:  
Page 32 of 41 
  An adverse event that is not expected, i.e. not listed in the informed consent document 
or the investigator’s brochure;  
 An expected adverse event that occurs at a greater frequenc y or duration than 
expected;  
 Any adverse event that would require modification of the protocol and/or informed 
consent document.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring.   According to the UF IRB assessment for potential risk for 
subject form (Appendix N), our study is c onsidered low risk in that it meets the following 
criteria: the study is therapeutic but the agent to be studied has a known safety profile 
and is to be used for an indication and  population already approved by [CONTACT_1622]. 
Expected adverse events are of low s everity and reversible with low chance of serious 
harm.   Thus, a DSMB is not required and we do not feel that it is necessary since we 
are targeting patients who have demonstrated tolerance to beta -blocker therapy and are 
excluding those at increase d risk for adverse effects with metoprolol.  In addition, 
metoprolol has a wide therapeutic index and will be titrated up with close monitoring for 
those not on a beta -blocker at baseline.   
Data Safety Monitoring P lan.  Planned assessments for individual patient  safety are as 
follows:

Analysis of the Study:  
 
Aim 1: Comp are the pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular effects of brand name 
[CONTACT_861527] : 
 
Heart rate variability and [ADDRESS_1200840] of: high -
frequency variability (parasympathetic activity), low -frequency variability (primary 
sympathetic a ctivity), and total variability.43 Ratios of HR variability will include: high to low 
(parasympathetic/sympathetic balance), high to total (normalized measure of 
parasympathetic activity), and low to total ( normalized measure of sympathetic activity).  
Spectral measures of HR variability will be compared between brand name [CONTACT_861528] 34 of 41 
 generic treatments (and over quartiles of the day for HR variability) using an analysis of 
variance model with measures repeated on 2 factors (treatment and quartile). Treatment 
order will be included as a covariate in the model to test for any differences in response 
based on the sequence of drug administration.  Significance levels will be adjusted for 
violation of the assumption of compound symmetry using the Greenhouse -Geiser 
correction.     
 
24 hour ambulatory and home BP data .  Data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_861511].   The BP data will be ana lyzed as previously described.35 24 hour 
ambulatory data will be cleaned for artifactual readings and then hourly averages taken. 
These data can be used with the PK data for PK/PD modeling.  Additionally, these data, 
along with the AM and PM home BP data across multiple days will be analyzed to create 
a compos ite BP, as previously described.[ADDRESS_1200841] over each of the 24 -hour recording periods using 
analysis of variance for repeated measures, with measures repeated on treatment and 
time of day.  
 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacometric modeling . Data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_1629] i nvestigator 
blinded to the metoprolol formulation the patient was taking and to patient genotype and 
other characteristics.  A non -compartmental analysis will be performed in Phoenix® 
WinNonlin® (version 6.1 or higher, Pharsight, www.pharsight.com ) to determine the basic 
pharmacokinetic parameters of generic metoprolol succinate 1, generic metoprolol 
succinate 2 and Toprol XL  following oral administration. Log -transformed values of the 
key pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, C max) for each drug product will then be used for 
bioequivalence testing.  Ratios of geometric means and arithmetic means as well as 
respective 90% CI (0.8 -1.25 limits) will be computed for each drug product.  
Bioinequivalence is declared when the 90 %CI for PK parameters of the test product is 
completely outside the limits of 80 -125% of the reference (brand name) product. In 
addition, a fully -parametric population pharmacokinetic (pop -PK) model will be developed 
in NONMEM® (version 7.2 or higher, ICON  Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, 
[LOCATION_003]) to simultaneously estimate the population pharmacokinetic parameters 
characterizing the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of metoprolol 
succinate as well as the interindividual and residua l variability associated with them.  The 
developed pop -PK model will then be linked to the corresponding pharmacodynamic (PD) 
endpoints to: i) characterize the dose -concentration -response relationship of all three 
drug products on both a patient level as w ell as a population level and ii) to determine if 
potential differences in PK between drug products translate into statistically significant 
differences in the dose -concentration -response relationship.   We will also include 
treatment with a proton pump inh ibitor and CYP2D6  genotype as parameters in the 
model.    
 
Power analysis . Due to the cross -over design, each participant will have responses to [ADDRESS_1200842] deviation of all the endpoints: T max (6 ± 2.3 hr), AUC (3260 ± 993 ng*hr/mL), 
Cmax (163 ± 34 ng/mL), and HR variability (13,886 ± 1,479 ms2).33,34  With a sample size 
of 38, at an alpha level of 0.025 (0.05/2 comparisons), using a [ADDRESS_1200843] >80% power to detect a 20% difference in T max, 16% difference in AUC, and 
6% difference in HR variability (Table 2).   We will target 5 0 total patients for enrollment to 
allow for drop -outs.   
 
Aim 2 : Determine the impact of gastric pH variation on the concentration -response 
relationship with different metoprolol ER products   
 
SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_861454].  Data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_861512].  
Analyses of SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_861479]™  software ( Given Imaging ).  
Only data during the time of the 24 -hour studies will be used for analysis. Mean 
intragastrointestinal pH for every hour and 24 hours will be obtained from the raw pH data.  
Data on gastric transit time and pH will be explored as potential covariates for the PK/PD 
model developed in Specific Aim 1, particularly with respect to their influence on the rate 
and extent of metoprolol absorption from the [ADDRESS_1200844] for 
differences between formulations.  For ex ample, the mean difference in C max for generic 
#[ADDRESS_1200845] will be compared between the two pH groups using 
analysis of covariance controlling for effects of baseline characteristics.   
 
Power analysis:  According to a prior study using the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ,44 the mean (SD) gastric 
pH among healthy subjects without GI diseases was 2.79 (1.39). Based on these data, at 
an alpha level of 0.025, with [ADDRESS_1200846] >80%  power to detect an effect 
size of ≥ 0.65 (variability in gastrointestinal pH of ≥ 0.9 unit) between subjects.  Therefore 
this sample size should provide us with adequate interpatient variability in pH to assess Table 4. Data for power calculation

Page [ADDRESS_1200847] in PMs /IMs versus EMs. For example, the mean difference in C max for 
generic #[ADDRESS_1200848] will be compared between the CYP2D6 
phenotype groups using analysis of cov ariance controlling for effects of baseline 
characteristics. Secondary analyses will compare the PK -PD relationships across 
formulations between the two CYP2D6 phenotype groups.  In addition, CYP2D6 genotype 
will be explored as potential covariate for the PK/PD model developed in Specific Aim [ADDRESS_1200849] 10 PMs/IMs 
and the remainder EMs. This will be possible due to targeted recruitment of participants 
with known genotypes. According t o a meta -analysis of [ADDRESS_1200850] doubled compared to EMs: 2.[ADDRESS_1200851] deviation of C max and AUC for 200 mg of metoprolol to 
be: C max: 312 ± 338 and AUC: 1462 ± 1522 for EMs, C max: 512 ± 572 and AUC: 3692 ± 
4491 for IMs; C max: 710 ± 504 and AUC: 7106 ± [ADDRESS_1200852] 10 
PMs/IMs and the remainder of the study population composed of E M individuals, at alpha 
of 0.05, we would have >80% power to detect effect size of ≥ 1.2, which is equivalent to 
Cmax di fference of 405 (1.3 fold) or AUC difference of 1754 (1.2 fold). These numbers 
were smaller than those differences reported in the meta -analyses.15 
 
Data Management/Confidentiality of Data/Records:  
 
Case Report Form (CRF) will be used for each subject. To protect the participant’s right 
of privacy, the  Patient Identification Number will identify patient s’ individual records 
related to the study and will be stored in locked cabinets with limited access, and 
electronic files will be kept in secured database. A de -identified dataset from the database 
using  a patient identification number will then be shared with statistician for analysis. 
During the study, data will be analyzed as it becomes available by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Larisa Cavallari. 
No early closure is planned because of the limited scope and projected low risk of  the 
study.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_1200853] consents to banking, s amples from the study subjects will be stored at the Center 
for Pharmacogenomics Laboratory with limited access for authorized personnel only. All 
samples will be identified by a code that can be linked to the patient ’s identity only by [CONTACT_861513]. After completion of the study, all left over samples from subjects who 
consented to banking will be stored in the Cent er for Pharmacogenomics . All other samples 
and data will be destroyed upon completion of the study  according to the University of 
[LOCATION_012]’s Human Subjects Protections requirements .

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THI S STUDY  
1. Name [CONTACT_2385] ("Study Subject")  
 ___________________________________________________________________  
2. What is the Title of this research study? 
Open- Labeled Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic (PK -PD) Studies of 
Metoprolol ER  
3. Who do you call if you have questions about this research study? 
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_861452], PharmD at (352) 273- 8245  
Other research staff: Study Physician: [CONTACT_861535] egfried Schmidt at (352) 265- [ADDRESS_1200870] #: 201500092  Page 2 of 16 
IRB Version: 10/19/2011  
PI [CONTACT_15261]:   9/13/2017  4.  Who is paying for this research study?   
The sponsor of this study is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
5. Why is this research study  being done ?  
The purpose of this  research study is t o compare the quality and effectiveness of two 
generic versions of a blood pressure lowering medication, called metoprolol 
succinate, to the brand name [CONTACT_861529] ( Toprol XL). The study will 
also look at the effect of genetic makeup on drug response.  Genetic makeup is what 
determines a person’s body traits, such as height and eye color. Genetic makeup differs from person to person, which is why one person’s body traits are different from another person’s. Genetic makeup can also determine how the body breaks down a drug. This can cause drug effects to differ from person to person.    
You are being asked to be in this research study because you are currently being 
treated for high blood pressure and/or you previously participated in the 
Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses trials (PEAR -1 or 
PEAR -2). 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov , as 
required by U.S. Law.  This Web site will not include information that can identi fy you.  
At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web 
site at any time.  
 
WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT IF YOU PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY ? 
6.   What w ill be done as part  of your normal clinical care (even if you did not 
partici pate in this research  study )?  
Regular visits to your doctor for blood pressure checks and occasional blood work is part of your normal clinical care for your high blood pressure.  Checking your blood pressure at home may also be part of your normal care.  Your normal clinical care 
should continue.  Things will be done during your participation in this study that would not be considered part of normal clinical care. While you would normally have your blood pressure monitored by [CONTACT_4904], we will monitor it in more ways.  We will also look at drug levels in your body and your heart rate during exercise.    
7.  What will be done only because you are in this research study ?  
If you are18 years of age or older, and agree to participate in the study, it will i nvolve 
a minimum of 7 study visits (possibly up to 15 visits) occurring  over a 6 -15 week 
period.  Three ( 3) of the visits will involve an overnight stay, and each overnight stay 
will take about [ADDRESS_1200871] #: 201500092  Page 3 of 16

PI [CONTACT_15261]:   9/13/2017  a study m edication for your blood pressure called Toprol XL for periods 1 and 3.  You 
will be given a generic form of Toprol XL (Generic Drug A or Generic Drug B) for 
periods [ADDRESS_1200872] visit ( screening  visit) and outpat ient visits will occur at the Clinical Research 
Center (CRC) at the UF Health Clinical and Translational Research Building  (CTRB)  
at [ADDRESS_1200873], Gainesville, FL [ZIP_CODE].  
Screening  Visit 
If you agree to participate by [CONTACT_3368] , the study nurse will draw 3 
teaspoonfuls (15 m L) of blood from a vein in your arm.  Two teasp oons  (10 mL) will be 
drawn for basic blood work and one t easp oon (5 mL) will be drawn for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
The study nurse will collect your medical history and the list of your current 
medication. The study nurse or the Clinical Research Center Nursing staff will check 
your vitals ( blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], temperature)  and height and 
weigh t. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, we will perform a urine 
pregnancy test.  This will end the screening  visit.  If you still qualify for the study after 
initial testing, the study nurse will call you to schedule the enrollment  visit. 
Enrollment  Visit 
The study nurse will check your vitals and t he study physician, [CONTACT_861535] egfried Schmidt 
will perform a physical exam and discuss your medical history with you.   If you are 
eligible to participate you will be randomized to one of two groups like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin.  
You or the researcher cannot choose which group you will be assigned to:    
• Study Group A - start with Toprol XL, switch to Actavis  metoprolol  succinate , 
switch back to Toprol XL, then switch to [CONTACT_23015]  metoprolol succinate.  
• Study Group B - start with Toprol XL,  switch to [CONTACT_23015]  metoprolol  succinate , 
switch back to Toprol XL, then switch to Actavis metoprolol  succinate . 
Each study group will consist of treatment with Toprol XL for [ADDRESS_1200874] of four treatment periods.  
Period 1  
You will be provided with the blood pressure medication called Toprol XL (metoprolol 
succinate) . You will take this study medication for 7- [ADDRESS_1200875] #: 201500092  Page 4 of 16

Also, y our dose of metoprolol succinate may be adjusted up or down to achieve or  
maintain y our goal blood pressure.   If you are not taking metoprolol succinate or a 
drug like metoprolol succinate before the study, Toprol XL will be started at a low 
dose of 50 mg/day .  It may be necessary to reduce the dose or stop another blood 
pressure medicine so that you can safely take the study medication.  By [CONTACT_60741], you are providing permission for [CONTACT_861536] or [CONTACT_861535] egfried 
Schmidt to  talk to your doctor before adjusting any of your medications. You may be 
asked to return for  an outpatient visit once a week for up to [ADDRESS_1200877] one 
titration visit, documenting BP < 140/[ADDRESS_1200878] overnight  study visit. You will need to take your study medication each morning at 
9AM. Metoprolol succinate extended- release tablets should be swallowed whole and 
not chewed or crushed.  
You will be provided a home blood pressure monitor. The study nurse will show you how to use the monitor. You will be asked to take your blood pressure each morning 
when you wake up and each evening when you go to bed. If your systolic blood pressure (top number) is above 170 or below 100, diastolic blood pressure (bottom number) is abov e 110, or heart rate (pulse) is less than [ADDRESS_1200879] the study nurse for a BP check visit as soon as possible. You should bring your home blood pressure monitor and study medication pi[INVESTIGATOR_861482] a study visit. Your study nurse will provide you with the dates and times you will need to come in for each study visit.  
Overnight study visit  
After taking your study medication for 7-  28 days, you will  be asked to come to the 
CRC or to U F Health Shands Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7948] 7:[ADDRESS_1200880] a blood pressure cuff placed on your arm and electrodes (small, flat, sticky patches) placed on your chest.  The electrodes will be attached to a monitor that you may clip to your belt or wear around 
your neck to check your heart rate. The cuff will be attached to a monitor that can be worn on your waist.  The monitor will take your blood pressure at random times [ADDRESS_1200881] a catheter placed in a vein in your arm so that blood can be drawn.

tablespoonfuls (72 m L).  The times of the blood draw are around 9 AM, 9:30 AM, 10 
AM, 11 AM, 12 PM, 1 PM, 3 PM, 5 PM, 9 PM, 1 AM, 5 AM, and 9 AM the following 
day. 
You will be provided with a " SmartBar® " (similar to a granola bar) to eat around 8:30 
AM. You will be asked to swallow a " SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® " capsule with water right after you 
finish the SmartBar . The “ SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® " capsule is a blue and clear oblong pi[INVESTIGATOR_861483] a vitamin pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. Both the SmartBar  and " SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® " capsule are 
cleared by [CONTACT_2165]. You will be given a special recorder to 
chart the progress of the " SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® " capsule as it moves through your body. The 
recorder will chart the pH (acidity) of your stomach and intestines. The recorder 
should remain within [ADDRESS_1200883] (cord) around your neck.  A pproximately at 9 AM, you will be given a dose of your study 
medication.   Actual time s may vary depending on your time of arrival, blood draws, 
and/or intake of SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  
You will also be provided with a menu of meals to select from during your overnight stay. The menu includes a variety of meals including vegetarian options . The same 
food options you chose for the first overnight visit will be provided to you for the second and third overnight visits.  
The blood pressure monitor, heart rate monitor, and catheter in your arm will be removed around 9AM the following morning. You will be asked to take your next dose 
of study medication approximately at 9AM. You will be taken to the Shands Heart 
Center, located in the Shands hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], for an exercise treadmill test around 11AM . 
The actual times  may vary depending on a time  of treadmill availability,  but we will 
inform you as soon as we know . Small areas on your chest will  be cleaned, and 
electrodes (small, flat, sticky patches) will be placed on these areas. The electrodes will be attached to an electrocardiograph monit or (ECG or EKG) that charts your 
heart's electrical activity. A blood pressure cuff will be placed around your arm. You will be asked to start walking on the treadmill. The speed and slope of the treadmill will be increased every [ADDRESS_1200884] between 7 and 12 minutes. Your heart's electrical activity, heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored before, during, and after the test. You will also be asked how you are feeling at regular intervals during the test. At the end of the test, you will be asked to walk slowly for a couple of minutes to cool down. Your heart's electrical activity, heart rate, and blood pressure will continue to be monitored until they return to pre- test levels. The electrodes will then be removed.  You will be 
provided with up to a 2- week  supply of the next study drug to begin taking at 9 AM the 
next day.     
SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]®  Capsule  
The " SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® " capsule will naturally pass during a bowel movement within 3 t o 5

WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THIS STUDY AND  
WHAT ARE  YOUR OPTIONS ? 
10. What are the possible discomforts and risks from taking part in this research 
study ? 
There is a risk that your blood pressure will become too low which may cause you to 
feel light headed or dizzy or to feel tightness or pressure in your  chest. Your blood 
pressure may be elevated if it does not respond well to the blood pressure medications you are given, which might cause you to have a headache or feel pressure in your head. This might also cause you to feel pressure in your chest. There is also a risk with elevated blood pressure of heart attack or stroke. If you 
experience any of these symptoms you should measure your blood pressure with your home monitor and you should call your study nurse or doctor immediately to report your blood pr essure and your symptoms.  
The study medication is a beta blocker, and may cause you to experience a slow heartbeat , dizziness, light -headedness, drowsiness, fatigue, depression, diarrhea, 
IRB Project #: 201500092  Page 9 of 16 
IRB Version: 10/19/2011  
PI [CONTACT_15261]:   9/13/2017  nausea or vomiting, shortness of breath and wheezing. If you experience any of these 
symptoms you should report them immediately to the study nurse listed in section 3. The study medication may also involve risks to the embryo or fetus if you are pregnant or become pregnant while taking the medication.  
The risks of placing a catheter in your arm for drawing blood include discomfort at the site of puncture; possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site; rarely an infection; and uncommonly, faintness from the procedure.  The total amount of blood 
drawn during the entire study is about 15 tablespoons (about 1/2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731]).  
The risks with the " SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® " capsule include the capsule staying in the body longer 
than expected and/or accidentally inhaling the capsule. If you experience any unusual symptoms, you should report them immediately. There is a risk of damage to the 
stomach or intestines if the " SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® " capsule is in the body during an MRI test.  
Side effects of the exercise treadmill test can include shortness of breath, light headedness, drop in blood pressure, or abnormal heart rhythm. In rare cases, these side effects can be serious or life- threatening. Medical staff trained in emergency 
response will be present for the studies.  Also possible are direct injuries such as bruises, sprains, and strains and indirect problems such as worsening of pain from arthritis.  
The risks of genetic testing include those related to confidentiality surrounding the            genetic information, and the chance that the genetic information could in some way expose you  to increased risk regarding employment or that future life, health, disability or long term care insurance providers could potentially use this genetic information to deny, limit or raise rates for insurance coverage. To protect you from this risk, your DNA will not be stored with any of your identifying information and the results of your genetic testing will not be given to you and it will not bec ome part of 
your medical record. If you signed a separate consent form for banking,  your left over 
DNA and study records will be stored for future unknown research in the Center for Pharmacogenomcis Tissue and Data Bank.  If you do not sign the consent for m for 
banking, your leftover DNA and study records will be used until the end of  this study 
and then destroyed.  None of your personal health information or any identifying 
information will be stored with your DNA and study records.  If your DNA or study 
recorders are shared with other researchers, none of your personal identifying 
information will be shared.  
A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), makes it 
illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and m ost employers to 
discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  Additional information 
can be obtained at: http://irb.ufl.edu/gina.html or call 1- [PHONE_17837].  If you think this 
law has been violated, it will be up to you to pursue any compensation from the offending insurance company and/or employer.  
Researchers will take appropriate steps to protect any information they collect about you.  However, there is a slight risk that information about you could be revealed inappropriately or accidentally.  Depending on the nature of the information, such a release could upset or embarrass you, or possibly affect your insurability or

be collected, used, protected, and shared.  
The results of the following tests are being done for research purposes only and might 
not be evaluated or used to diagnose/ treat the participant’s medical problems. The results might not be entered into the participant’s medical record. These t ests may 
need to be repeated by [CONTACT_2299]’s primary care doctor if required for the participant’s medical care in the future:

2.1.
The purpose of this open-label, extension study is to evaluate the long-term safety of repeated 
MT10109L treatment of GL and/or LCL in participants with moderate to severe GL, LCL, or 
both (GL and LCL) who completed the lead-in pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies (MT10109L-001, -002,
- 005, and -006) over an additional 24 months.
The clinical development program for MT10109L in the treatment of GL and LCL includes 
4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter 
clinical studies. Each of these studies will provide the primary safety and efficacy data for 
MT10109L treatment of GL (Studies MT10109L-001 and -005) and LCL 
(Studies MT10109L-002 and -006). Participants completing these studies will be eligible to 
enroll into the current 24-month open-label extension study (Study MT10109L-004) and 
continue their treatment of GL, LCL, or both GL and LCL.
2.2.
Glabellar lines are deep furrows or frown lines in the glabellar area of the face and LCL (or CFL) 
are horizontal smile lines by [CONTACT_820000]. Both types of facial lines result from the 
repetitive functional action of the underlying mimetic facial musculature during animation 
(Blitzer 1993). When injected at therapeutic doses, MT10109L produces partial chemical 
denervation of the muscle, resulting in localized reduction in muscle activity. Because GL and 
LCL result from muscular activity, the muscle relaxation leads to a temporary relief of facial 
lines. While it was previously thought that these facial lines were structural and permanent, the 
effects of these injections demonstrate the lines are part functional and remain because of 
constant muscle tone ( Ferreira 2004; Garcia 1996).
The development of facial lines (such as GL and LCL) is an age-related change of the face that 
occurs because of the repetitive muscle contractions that are associated with common facial 
expressions. Thus, these facial lines can be observed with contraction (dynamic rhytides) or in 
more severe cases in repose (static rhytides). Increasing severity in the appearance of facial lines 
has been associated 
self-esteem and sense of well-being (Koblenzer 1996 ). Furthermore, the appearance of these 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-004 AMD 5
MT10109L
17
facial lines can lead to a miscommunication of an emotional state of anger, anxiety, disapproval, 
or sadness ( Khan 2001) causing distress and affecting social interactions ( Finn 2003).
The popularity of BoNT/A cosmetic treatment of LCL and GL in adults is related to its proven 
efficacy for reducing moderate to severe facial lines ( Beer 2006 ); well documented safety profile 
(Brin 2009); and positive impact on psychological well-being and the resulting psychosocial 
benefits (Finn 2003).
The purpose of this open-label, extension study is to evaluate the long-term safety of repeated 
MT10109L treatment of GL and/or LCL in participants with moderate to severe GL, LCL, or 
both (GL and LCL) who completed the lead-in pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies (MT10109L-001, -002,
- 005, and -006) over an additional 24 months. This information will supplement the primary 
safety and efficacy data from the 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_819997]-in Phase 3 studies. Together with their lead-in
Phase 3 study participation, participants who complete this study will provide up to 3 years of 
continuous treatment exposure data.

2.3.
Generally, the popularity of BoNT/A cosmetic treatment of GL and LCL in adults is related to its 
proven efficacy for reducing moderate to severe facial lines ( Beer 2006 ); well documented safety 
profile ( Brin 2009 ); and positive impact on psychological well -being and the resulting 
psychosocial benefits ( Finn 2003 ).
In some cases, botulinum toxin effect may be observed beyond the site of local injection. The 
symptoms may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, eyelid ptosis, 
dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. Swallowing 
and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to 
distant spread of toxin effects with other BoNT/A treatments for noncosmetic indications. The 
risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, but symptoms can also 
occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions.
Reduced blinking after BoNT/A product injection to the orbicularis muscle can lead to corneal 
exposure, persistent epi[INVESTIGATOR_17754], and corneal ulceration with perforation. In the use of 
another BoNT/A product for treatment of blepharospasm, [ADDRESS_1136311].

8.2.1.
The investigator will question the participant to ascertain whether any adverse events were 
experienced since the previous visit. Additionally, at treatment visits, the participants will be 
observed for 30 minutes following study intervention. All pertinent information regarding 
adverse events (ie, date of onset and stop, duration, outcome, severity, relationship to study 
intervention, action or treatment required) will be obtained and recorded in the source documents 
and appropriate eCRF page.
8.2.2.
Pulse rate (beats per minute): Participants are to be seated for at least 2 minutes, and pulse 
rate will be counted over 60 seconds and recorded in the source document and eCRF as 
beats per minute.
Blood pressure (mm Hg): Participants are to be seated for at least 2 minutes, and 
systolic/diastolic blood pressure will be measured.
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (breaths per minute): Participants are to be seated for at least [ADDRESS_1136317] pregnancy tests at the timepoints specified in the SoA,
or more fre discretion.
8.2.4.
Suicidal risk monitoring is not applicable for this study.
8.3.
The definitions of an adverse event or SAE can be found in Appendix 3.
Adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_2299].
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an adverse event or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up adverse events that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or study 
procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section 7).
The following expected adverse drug reactions are based on BOTOX clinical trial data for the 
treatment of GL and LCL ( Tables 8-1 and 8-2, respectively).

incidence. Therefore, no treatment for these reactions is recommended. If these reactions are 
moderate or severe, medical help should be sought as needed.
8.3.1.
All adverse events will be collected from the signing of the ICF at the timepoints specified in the 
SoA (Section 1.3), and as observed or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_820003] 30 days 
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention, but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded in the adverse event section of the eCRF.
All SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF study at the timepoints specified in the 
SoA (Section 1.3), and as observed or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_19288], until at least 
[ADDRESS_1136318] administration of MT10109L intervention. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
inAppendix 3. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 
24 hours of it being available.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek adverse event or SAE information after 
conclusion of the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers 
the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator 
must promptly notify the sponsor.
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of adverse events and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
8.3.2.
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or SAEs. Open-ended 
and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
adverse event occurrences.
8.3.3.
After the initial adverse event/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All TEAEs including SAEs, AESIs (Section 8.3.6), and 
TEAEs that lead to study discontinuation will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the 
event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3).

include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals. 
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, the 
investigator will provide the sponsor with a copy of any postmortem findings including 
histopathology. 
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. 
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of 
the information. 
8.3.4. 
 Prompt notification by [CONTACT_22836] a 
study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
 The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/IECs, and investigators.  
 Investigator safety reports must be prepared for S[LOCATION_003]Rs according to local regulatory 
requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
 An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review 
and then file it along with the ochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if 
appropriate according to local requirements. 
8.3.5. 
 Urine pregnancy testing will be conducted for women of childbearing potential prior to each 
study intervention and at the study exit visit. See Appendix [ADDRESS_1136320] agree to use a 
highly effective or acceptable contraception method (Appendix 7) consistently and correctly 
throughout the duration of the study. For participants of childbearing potential in [LOCATION_013] 
and Belgium , only highly effective contraception methods are allowed for this study. 
 Women who test positive for urine pregnancy test will NOT receive further intervention and 
will be discontinued from the study.  
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-[ADDRESS_1136321] complete end-of-study procedures 
and be followed up for pregnancy outcome.
Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence 
of anomalies) or indication for the procedure
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours of
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 7.Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) or genetic abnormalities (whether leading to an elective 
abortion or not) are considered SAEs.
8.3.7.Medication error refers to any unintended error in the dosing and/or administration of the study 
intervention as per instructions in the protocol. Medication errors generally fall into 4 categories 
as follows:
Wrong study intervention
Wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, amount)
Wrong route of administration
Wrong participant (ie, not administered to the intended participant)
Medication errors include occurrences of overdose and underdose of the study intervention.
Overdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity of the study intervention given per 
administration or per day that is above the maximum recommended dose according to the 
reference safety information or protocol for the study intervention or comparator as applicable. 
See Section 8.4 for information on the treatment of overdose. 
Underdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity of the study intervention given per 
administration or per day that is under the minimum recommended dose according to the 
protocol. 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-[ADDRESS_1136322]. Supportive care could involve the need for a tracheostomy and/or prolonged mechanical 
ventilation, in addition to other general supportive care.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should educate the participant, monitor the course of 
overdose, contact [CONTACT_820004], document the quantity of the excess dose, associated 
adverse events as well as the duration of the overdose in the eCRF.8.5.

temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related 
to the study intervention.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with 
the use of study intervention.
.
Events Meeting the AE Definition 
Any abnormal safety assessments (eg, vital signs measurements), including those that 
worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease); for 
example:
The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or

adjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy, and/or 
 The test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_4687]. 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  New condition detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE 
or SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. 
 Lack of efficacy or failure of expected pharmacological action per se will not be reported 
as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, 
the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be 
reported as AEs or SAEs if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
 
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition  
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_820009], in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not 
require recording as an AE.

defined) of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
 
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to

 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
 Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-[ADDRESS_1136327] medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
a. Results in death 
b. Is life threatening 
The term life threatening  in the definition of serious  refers to an event in which the participant 
was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically 
might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9234], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or intervention 
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt as to 
whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51956], the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_287408] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE. 
d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity 
 
life functions. 
 This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-004 AMD 5  
MT10109L

f. Other situations: 
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10913]. These events should usually be considered 
serious. 
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive intervention in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  
10.3.3. 
AE and SAE Recording 
 When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all  
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event. 
 The investigator will then record all relevant AE or SAE information in the eCRF. 
 It is not  
records to the sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE or SAE eCRF page. 
 There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_737889]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_669738].  The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-[ADDRESS_1136328] one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. 
Assessment of Causality 
 The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and 
each occurrence of each AE or SAE. 
 A reasonable possibility  of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
 The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
 Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated. 
 The investigator will also consult the IB and/or product information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment. 
 For each AE or SAE, the investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE or SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
 There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.  The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information 
and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.

 Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_819999], medical examination, or medical history interview. 
3. Postmenopausal female 
 A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. However, in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
 Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to continue to 
use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods from the

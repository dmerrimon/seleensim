considered acceptable given the exhaustive safety screening , 
including cognitive functi on (exclusion criterion no.  5) and 
mobility (inclusion criterion no.  2), and the exclusion of

Trial title:  
Randomised , double-blind, placebo -controlled, complete [ADDRESS_1030122] cross -over phase IIa trial to 
investigate safety and efficacy of two THN102 doses in subjects with excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_752283]’s disease.  
Protocol number: THN102-[ADDRESS_1030123] numb er: 2017-004475-31 
Coordinating investigator:  
 
[CONTACT_4718] / trial sites: An estimated 28 sites in Europe and the [LOCATION_003].  
Planned duration of the trial:  
First subject first visit: Q2/[ADDRESS_1030124] visit: Q4/2018  
Phase: IIa (proof -of-concept) 
Objectives:  
Primary objective:  
• To assess the safety profile of THN102 (modafinil/flecainide combination) at two doses 
(200 mg/18 mg and 200  mg/2 mg) versus placebo in subjects with excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_752284]’s disease (PD).  
Secondary objectives:  
1. To quantify the efficacy of THN102 versus placebo in improving sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].  
2. To quantify the efficacy of THN102 versus placebo in improving  
a. attention, vigilanc e 
b. cognition  
3. To determine the dose response profile of THN102 versus placebo on efficacy parameters.  
4. To determine the plasma levels of modafinil and flecainide at steady state.  
Methods / trial design:  
This is a prospective, double -blind, randomised, control led trial using a complete [ADDRESS_1030125] cross -over 
design. Subjects will attend seven on-site visits and five phone call visits.  
The seven trial periods are depi[INVESTIGATOR_48393]:  
Screening  Treatment I  Washout I * Treatment II  Washout II * Treatment III  Follow-Up 
1-2 weeks 2 weeks 1(2) weeks  2 weeks 1(2) weeks  2 weeks 1 week 
No treatment  A, B, or C  No treatment  A, B, or C  No treatment  A, B, or C  No treatment  
(Dose A = placebo; Dose B = THN102 200 mg/2 mg; Dose C = THN102 200 mg/18 mg.)  
* Washout periods can be extended to up to [ADDRESS_1030126].  
At visit VR (baseline visit) the subjects will be equally randomised (1:1:1:1:1:1) double -blind to a 
treatment sequence containing three treatment periods  (shown below).  
Sequence  Treatment period I  Treatment period II  Treatment period III  
1 Dose A Dose B Dose C 
2 Dose B Dose C Dose A 
3 Dose C Dose A Dose B 
4 Dose A Dose C Dose B 
5 Dose C Dose B Dose A 
6 Dose B Dose A Dose C 
 
The duration of each treatment period is 2 weeks, with a 1-week washout in between ( to avoid carry -
over effects)  and a 1-week follow -up period after the last treatment period. Washout periods can be 
extended up to two weeks. THN102 will be administered orally once daily.

THN102-[ADDRESS_1030131] 25% ESS improvement 
from baseline , at the end of each treatment period  
10. Absence of residual somnolence, i.e. ESS  < [ADDRESS_1030132] (PVT) variables change from baselin e at the end of each treatment 
period 
12. MoCA score change from baseline at the end of each treatment period

at the end of each treatment period  
15. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_376621] (subject diaries) change from baseline at the end of each treatment period  
 
Sample size justification  
For the purpose of sample size planning ESS is considered to be the key efficacy endpoint. Solid 
information on the expected difference between placebo and THN102 dose and the associated 
intrasubject variance are not available. Using results reported in Adler et al. as a rough orientation an 
effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_1030133] a power of 82% to detect this effect size 
based on a paired t -test with a 0.05 two -sided significance level. To account for drop o uts 60 subjects 
will be randomised.  
 
Analysis populations  
• The Safety Set (SS) include s all subjects who have received IMP at least once.  
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  includes all randomised subjects  with an evaluable ESS score at the 
end of at least one treatment period . The efficacy analyses will be conducted on the FAS. 
• The Per Protocol (PP) set includes all subjects who have completed the trial without major protocol 
deviation.  Major and minor vio lations will be defined in the SAP.  The main secondary endpoints 
(ESS, PVT and cognition) will be analysed with the PP set to demonstrate robustness of the 
primary analysis.  
• The pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis set will include all subjects who have received  treatment as 
per protocol (even if the trial was not completed) and who present no major protocol deviations 
with an impact on PK.  
 
Efficacy analysis  
Continuous efficacy endpoints – the change from baseline at each key visit (end of  treatment  period I, 
II, and III) in ESS, PVT and MoCA - will be analysed using a mixed linear regression model. The 
model will include the treatment, period, treatment by [CONTACT_632425], sequence, and baseline scores 
as fixed effects, and the subject nested withi n sequence as a random effect.  
 
Categorical efficacy endpoints – absence of residual somnolence and ESS responder status  at each key 
visit – will be analysed using a mixed effects logistic regression model, with the treatment, period, 
treatment by [CONTACT_632425], sequence, and baseline scores as fixed effects, and the subject nested 
within sequence as a random effect.  
 
Treatment least square means and mean differences will be reported with their standard errors and 
95% confidence intervals. The signifi cance of the differences between Treatment A (THN102 
Placebo), Treatment B (THN102  200/2) and Treatment C (THN102  200/18) will be assessed with a 
contrast t-test at the two -sided 5% level.  
 
THN102-[ADDRESS_1030134] of the main demographics (age, gender) and disease characteristics (in terms of 
daily sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_752289], and cognitive impairment) on the efficacy outcomes.  
 
The presence of a significant treatment by [CONTACT_752326] a 
residual treatment (carryover) effect. In case of a significant treatment by p eriod interaction, period I 
results will be analysed separately, and further analyses will be performed to explore the carry -over 
effects. The methods for evaluation of carryover effects will be defined in the SAP.  
 
Safety analysis  
Safety data will be summ arised using summary statistics and frequency tabulations, as appropriate.  
 
Pharmacokinetics  
• Plasma concentrations of modafinil and flecainide at visits VR, V1B, V1C, V2B, V2C and V3B, 
considering time after last IMP intake.  
• Concentration -time data per treatment and subject for modafinil and for flecainide. Plasma 
concentrations and time post IMP intake, to assess range of exposure at steady state for each 
treatment.  
 
THN102-[ADDRESS_1030135] diary will be used cont inuously (i.e. also during washout periods) to record  get-up time, total time (hours) slept last night, wake -up periods during night sleep,  
time of drug intake and number of capsules taken (except screening phase diary issued at VS1), somnolence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], diurnal involuntary sleep attacks, voluntary naps, 
number of caffeinated drinks  and going-to-bed time.  
9. Visits V1A and V1B should be scheduled so that 3 days of actigraphy data can be collected. (The same for VS2 and VR, V2A and V2B, as well as V3A and V3B.) 
Actigraphy will be assessed using an actigraphy wrist band.  
10. MoCA should be performed in the morning.  
11. In case of early discontinuation, the same procedures as required for V3B will be performed.   
12. One PK blood sample will be taken  when the subject arrives on the site.  The times of blood withdrawal must be recorded.  
13. Starting from D ay 21, the visit day numbers are theoretical , as the washout period is flexible and can be extended to up to [ADDRESS_1030136] Drugs ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .. 21

Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background  
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative dis orders with an estimated 
prevalence of about 1% in subjects over [ADDRESS_1030145] on the quality of life of the patients. 
Excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  (EDS) occurs in 20 -50% of PD patients, it appears to be linked to disease 
severity and duration . Current hypotheses about the etiology of EDS include  neurodegenerative dopamine 
denervation, effects of dopaminergic drugs and nocturnal sleep disruption . [1,2] Currently there is no drug 
treatment approved for EDS in PD. Modafinil has been used in three small trials  [3,4,5] with positive 
results in two of the three trials and was well tolerated.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_587268], an H3 inverse agonist has been tested 
in large scale phase III trials, however, results are not published. Phase II trials in EDS in PD subjects are 
ongoing with JZP -110, a norepi[INVESTIGATOR_53311]-dopamine reuptake inhibitor and BEN-2001 (bavisant), a n H3 
antagonist  (Source: ClinicalTrials.gov).  
Modafinil, a wake promoting agent with a unique profile different from amphetamine, produces enhanced 
vigilance and arousal, is generally well tolerated and has  been approved in the US for  the treatment of 
daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156136] , [6,7,8,9]obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work disorder. In Europe the 
indication is limited to EDS in narcolepsy. Modafinil also has shown activity in fatigue in cancer, in 
neurodegenerative disorders, etc .). [10] Besides, many common situations involve short or long sleep 
deprivation periods or wake -sleep rhythm modifications. Sleep loss alters attention and vigilance, and 
reduces operational performance. Modafinil works well in sleep-deprived subjects to support vigilance, 
cognitive performance, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], and recovery sleep . [11,12,13,14,15] Positive impact on cognition, 
performance, and mood was seen in healthy subjects . [16,17] 
Context: Theranexus has investigated new potential drugs for treating narcolep sy and cataplexy among 
others. Theranexus has recently demonstrated that flecainide – a class Ic antiarrhythmic compound – can 
significantly modify at very low dose the basic pharmacological profile of modafinil by [CONTACT_752327]. The mode of action of this combination called THN102 
is under investigation, preliminary data have been published . [18] 
Non-clinical safety pharmacology:  According to  scientific advice from the French Medicines Agency 
(ANSM) a safety pharmacology study  was conducted  in alert dogs monitored by [CONTACT_752328] [ADDRESS_1030146] on cardiac electrophysiology profile and potential for arrhythmias 
with incremental single doses of 50/3, 50/9 and 75/9 mg/kg modafinil/flecainide  acetate. Concomitantly 
to the dose -dependent increase in heart rate and blood pressure linked to spontaneous motor activity and 
estimated to be elicited by [CONTACT_752329], the PR and the QT intervals were 
shortened. No significant effe cts on the QRS or the corrected QT (Fridericia’s and van de Water’s 
formulae) intervals were noted. No arrhythmia and no other morphology change were observed over the 
test periods in any dog in this model, which is considered as highly predictive for man.   
First phase I trial in healthy volunteers:  The safety and tolerance of THN102 was recently investigated 
in a 3-way cross -over, randomised, double -blind trial in 9 healthy male volunteers comparing single oral 
doses of THN102 (400 mg modafinil/50 mg flecainide acetate) to 400 mg modafinil/placebo and to 
placebo/placebo (trial THN102-101). The 50  mg dose selected for flecainide in phase I is derived of 
electrophysiological activity when administered alone and more than  twice the maximum dose planned 
(18 mg) in this trial . In the phase I trial (THN102 -101) body temperature as well as supi[INVESTIGATOR_752291]102 and modafinil treatment vs.  subjects on 
placebo. No o rthostatic symptoms were seen for any treatment. Safety and tolerance profile for adverse 
events was good and similar for THN102 and modafinil. In the [ADDRESS_1030147] on cardiac ele ctrophysiology was seen on QRS and QTc F 
(Fredericia’s formula) and no indication of arrhythmia or of morphological changes were documented for 
THN102-[ADDRESS_1030148] on the 
pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil, and parameters measured were similar (including C max, tmax, t1/2, and 
AUC) to modafinil given alone, and flecainide had the anticipated mean terminal plasma t 1/2 (12.2 h) and 
median tmax (3 h) but a lower C max, possibly due to lack of dose linearity when administering at low dose.  
Second phase I trial in sleep-deprived healthy volunteers:  A phase Ib trial has been terminated in Q2 
2016, in 20 healthy male volunteers undergoing a 40 -hour sleep deprivation protocol. This trial THN102-
102 included 20 healthy male subjects, in a double -blind, randomised, incomplete -block 3-period cross -
over design involving 5 treatments (n=12 per group): plac ebo, modafinil 100 mg, and combinations 
THN102 (modafinil 100 mg and 1, 3 or 9 mg flecainide  as THN1, THN3 and THN9), as 3 oral doses over 
18 h. THN102 -treated volunteers showed a statistically significant improvement in their vigilance levels 
(PVT with sp eed as primary endpoint) v ersus modafinil alone  without showing a linear dose effect . 
Secondary endpoints assessing cognition ([ADDRESS_1030149] Task) were 
consistent with this effect. Th ese results reinforce the interest in THN102 fo r the treatment of excessive 
daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], a debilitating symptom affecting a number of patients with CNS disorders such as 
narcolepsy and Parkinson’s disease.  
Ongoing phase IIa trial in narcoleptic subjects: A phase IIa trial (Trial THN102-201, doub le-blind, 
crossover design with 3 randomised periods with 300 mg modafinil + placebo, 300 mg modafinil + 3 mg 
flecainide and 300 mg modafinil + 27 mg flecainide  per day) is ongoing  since September [ADDRESS_1030150] cross -over design after a 2 -week stabilisation period with modafinil and followed by 1 -week 
washout.  
Objectives of this phase IIa trial: The most appropriate flec ainide dose in THN102 remains to be 
selected in subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD) experiencing excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (EDS) . This 
trial aims at assessing safety of THN102,  efficacy on EDS , vigilance and cognition  as well as modafinil 
and flecain ide plasma levels at steady state .  
It is assumed that THN102 treatment should improve the excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (EDS), without 
changing the safety profile seen with modafinil in Parkinson’s disease subjects. 
1.2. Test Drugs 
Extensive information on modafinil and flecainide can be found in their respective SmPCs (Summary of 
Product Characteristics , see investigator brochure, IB [31] Section 7 and 8 ). A table summarising the key 
features for both compounds and covering mechanism of action, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic 
profile, metabolism,  dosing and most prevalent adverse events  is provided in Table 1. Both compounds 
have been on the market for more than [ADDRESS_1030151] been 
treated with flecainide acetate. 
A review of THN102 pharmacology profile and safety pharmacolog y is provided in the IB. A dedicated 
electrophysiology study was performed in conscious dogs under telemetry with THN102 and no change 
on QTcF and QRS was detected up to maximum combination given (75  mg/kg modafinil + 9 mg/kg 
flecainide acetate ) and no occurrence of arrhythmias  was observed . Blood pressure, body temperature, 
and activity especially at night were increase d, presumably linked to the awakening effects of THN102 .

An extensive list of adverse events is presented in  each SmPC , albeit from patients on chronic treatment , 
frequently on concomitant therapy  and at a much higher dose in case of  flecainide. These documents  will 
serve as a basis to  identify Suspected  Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) in this trial (also 
see Section  7.2.2).  
Very rare incidence of sever e cutaneous skin reactions (such as Stevens -Johnson syndrome , DRESS 
syndrome or Toxic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_262679] ) may occur with modafinil. As reviewed in the SmPC the 
incidence  in clinical trials was found to be 0.8% in children (13 withdrawn out of 1585 cases and also 
including serious cutaneous adverse events) and 0% in adults based on  exposure of [ADDRESS_1030152] a sufficient body of information to 
assess the safety and efficacy profile of THN102 versus placebo in Parkinson’s disease subjects suffering 
from excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] . The sample size required for a crossover design is approximately one 
third of the size required in a parallel trial. To use a cross-over option is thus a viable alternative desig n, 
with a sample size of about  [ADDRESS_1030153] been selected , 
such as cognitive assessments including PVT and MoCA before a nd after each treatment period .  
A difference of 25% in ESS is considered clinically relevant. [ 26] Therefore responder  rates will be 
analysed, with responders being defined as subjects with at least 25% improvement from baseline.  
1.3.2. Dose selection  
Based on the re ported trial data with modaf inil in PD subjects, a single morning dose of 200 mg was 
chosen, as it showed efficacy on EDS [3,5]. (Subjects aged above [ADDRESS_1030154] three days .) Trials using a higher dose (up to 400 mg) failed to show  increased efficacy. 
[4] The flecainide doses were chosen based on preclinical pharmacological and exposure data  as well as 
results of the phase Ib  trial including healthy subjects after total sleep deprivation (THN102 -102). 
1.4. Risk/Benefit Ratio 
1.4.1. Evaluation of risk  
It is anticipated that the safety and tolerance profile of THN102 is similar to that of modafinil given alone 
in a PD-EDS population, with f requent occurrence of headache, gastric pain, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], tachycardia, 
dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, confusion, and blurred vision (see Table 1).  
For the treatment of tachyarrhythmias, flecainide is given at daily doses between 100 and 300  mg. In the 
present trial flecainide will be administered for EDS at two very low doses (2  mg, 18 mg as a single daily 
dose). In previous clinical studies with THN 102 flecainide reached a mean  (±SD) maximal concentration 
of 44.9±9.6 ng/mL when 50 mg were given as a single dose (study THN102 -101), and of 19 .5 ng/mL after 
27 mg (3 doses of 9 mg over 20 hours).  The Cmax data appeared linear between flecainide doses of 3, 9, 
and 27 mg: 2.2±0.8 ng/mL, 6.4 ±2.2 ng/mL, and 19.5 ±4.5 ng/mL respectively.  Extrapolating from steady 
state C max of 100 mg of flecainide  [25] (173±46 ng/mL), one would expect a steady stat e Cmax for 18 mg/d, 
the maximal flecainide dose used in this trial , of about 30  ng/mL. This exposure level is well below 
exposure levels where cardiovascular AEs are expected for flecainide.  [27] Flecainide does not trigger 
any signif icant cardiovascular effects below 100  ng/mL or even 200  ng/mL in plasma . [28,29,30]  
Thus, no cardiac effect is expected at the very low flecainide concentrations associated with the prescribed 
doses used in this trial and flecainide is not expected to raise any safety and tolerance issue in combination 
with THN102.  As a precautionary  measure cardiovascular exclusion criteri on 3 has been included.   
In the two phase I trials with THN102 the adverse events ’ profile did not significantly differ between 
THN102 and modafinil. A small but significant increase in blood pressure and heart rate was noted with 
both THN102 (400  mg/50 mg) and modafinil (400  mg/0 mg) in trial THN102-[ADDRESS_1030155] on cardiac conduction (QT, QRS) and no arrhythmia were seen (for more details , 
see the IB [31]). The lists of typi[INVESTIGATOR_752292].  
Risk will be minimised by [CONTACT_752330].  
1.4.2. Evaluation of benefit  
These subjects have documented excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (EDS) and it i s expected that THN102 at 
one or both doses may significantly improve excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], decreasing epi[INVESTIGATOR_752293].  
This is a proof-of-concept trial in approximately 60 PD subjects with EDS treated with THN102 at two 
doses (200 mg/18 mg, 200 mg/2 mg) compared to placebo  under a [ADDRESS_1030156], double -blind, cross -over trial 
design. The exposure is thus limited (2 weeks at each dose ). This design might contribu te to a better 
understanding of the mode of action of THN102 in the target population, to define the profile for dose 
response and time response and to assess recovery after washout. If successful, a phase IIb-III trial could 
be initiated in the future.   
In summary , the risk/benefit ratio for this proof-of-concept trial is considered as satisfactory .

The IMP vials, boxes and kits will be labelled individually according to allocation schedule, site, subject 
number, trial period and con tent. All labels will be in the respective language of the country and will be 
in accordance with local regulations. (Multi-language label booklets will be used.) Label terminology may 
vary according to local regulations, and country -specific remarks will be added as needed. Sample labels 
will be filed in the TMF.  

THN102-[ADDRESS_1030175] be instructed to return all the dispensed medication vials , boxes and packaging material  at 
the visit scheduled at the end of each period (V1B, V2B, V3B) whatever the state (i ntact, empty or partially 
used vials) . Treatment medications accountability and compliance should be done at V1B, V2B and V3B 
by [CONTACT_165106].  
5.2. Randomisation and Blinding 
5.2.1. Randomi sation 
Subjects will be randomised to receive all three treatments, according to one of the six possible sequences 
(see Table 3).  
The statistics department of the clinical CRO will prepare the randomisation  list using SAS® in the version 
specified in the data management plan (DMP). Randomis ation data will be kept strictly confidential, 
accessible only to authori sed persons, until the time of unblinding. The randomi sation scheme will be 
included in the clinical trial report for this protocol.  
The procedure will be as follows:  
• After a subject 's preliminary  eligibility is confirmed, the site will enter the subject into the eCRF  
system.  
• The eCRF  system will send a notification to the randomisation coordinator  at the clinical CRO . 
• The randomisation coordinator will allocate the subject to the randomisation code as follows:  
o He/she will assign each screened subject to the next available randomisation numbe r from the 
randomisation list until the first screening failure  of a subject with an assigned randomisation 
code is documented.  
o After such a screening failure has occurred, the randomisation coordinator will assign 
randomisation numbers to  subjects by [CONTACT_752336], to ensure the balance ( manual randomisation).  
o At sites with an unused kit from a previous screening failure, any new eligible subject will be 
assigned the randomisation number correspon ding to the unused kit (forced randomisation).  
• The randomisation coordinator will enter the randomisation code into the eCRF system and request 
the warehouse to send the  treatment  kit (labelled with the randomisation code ) and the emergency 
unblinding enve lope to the respective site.  
• The randomisation coordinator will document the status of all screened subjects and kits and will keep 
track of the balance between treatment sequences and unused kits available at the sites.   
• A subject will only be considered  randomised after his/her eligibility has been confirmed at VR.  
5.2.2. Blinding 
Modafinil [ADDRESS_1030176] and the interpretation of the trial, 
including the investigators, site personnel, and the sponsor’s staff, will be blinded to the treatment 
assignment . The randomisation schedule will be filed securely by [CONTACT_752337], in a manner such that 
blinding is properly maintained throughout the trial. Treatment  assignment will not be available until the 
completion of the trial and until after final data review (clinical data base lock), except in the case of 
emergency.  
Emergency unblinding will be done via sealed emergency code envelopes. Unblinding will not to be done 
unless an actual emergency occurs , and knowledge of the subject’s treatment assignment  affects his/her 
medical treatment. If possible, before breaking the  blind the investigator consults with the medical monitor 
to ascertain the necessity of breaking the code. A record will be made of the date, time and reason for 
breaking the blind. Subjects with S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be unblinded for regulatory reporting by [CONTACT_752338]. Other trial personnel and the investigators will receive blind 
information on the S[LOCATION_003]R until the trial has been unblinded.  
The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_752297] a medical emergency. The integrity of these sealed envelopes will be 
checked by [CONTACT_752339].  
The allocation schedule will be transmitted electronically  to the CRO in charge of secondary packaging . 
A secrecy agreement will be signed by [CONTACT_752340] p arty until the database has been frozen and the code has been released. The 
pharmacist s at trial site are blinded to trial treatment .  
All other groups involved in trial support will only have access  to treatment assignment after delivering 
data planned as per protocol  and after data freezing . Electronic transfer of allocation schedule to 
investigator s, sponsor, CRO's trial manager, and to other parties will be performed after freezing of the 
database. All documents for blinding and for signature [CONTACT_752382]. 
The set of envelopes  from principal i nvestigator s at each trial site and from pharmacovigilance  will be 
recovered at trial completion , inspected for integrity  and destroyed  by [CONTACT_456] . The integrity 
statement s will be stored in the TMF. 
5.3. Clinical Supplies Accountability  
The investigator or pharmacist will document IMP dispense and return on a drug accountability form. 
This will be verified by [CONTACT_752341] . In addition, the investigator or 
pharmacist will maintain a site inventory.  
Drug dispensa tion logs will be maintained throughout the trial at each visit and for each subject by [CONTACT_37233]. Comparison between capsule s count and eCRF as well as comparison between capsules count and 
subject diaries will be performed to obtain information on compliance. The originals  of these log forms, 
along with the filled drug accountability form will be filed in the  ISF and copi[INVESTIGATOR_752298]. 
After reconciliation a t the end of the trial, all unused IMP will be returned to the warehouse . 
5.4. Treatment Compliance  
The trial medication will be administered at home by [CONTACT_752342] a key  issue. Instructions will be provided to the subject  on respecting time schedule trying 
to maintain same time schedule throughout the trial and a 24-hour interval (± 1 hour)  between daily doses.

Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  5.5. Prior and Concomitant medication  
Efficacious medication for Parkinson's disease should not be discontinued for the sole purpose of 
the subject's enrolment into this clinical trial but must be maintained at stable dosage levels 
(exclusion criterion no. 11f).  
The following concomitant medication is prohibited  during the trial and within 6 weeks before VS1 : 
1. Neuroleptics, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants. Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_182951] -like drugs are only 
authorised if used regularly at stable indicated doses with an evening intake as sleep promoting agents.  
2. Psychostimu lants (except caffeine if no abuse and stable consumption) such as, but not limited to, 
modafinil, methylphenidate, amphetamine.  
3. Antidepressants except if maintained at stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to VS1 and anticipated 
to remain stable during t he trial in subjects with mild or moderate unipolar depression, providing the 
treatment is well tolerated and devoid of orthostatic hypotension and QT prolongation as documented 
at screening . 
4. Antiemetic medications (except domperidone), myo -relaxing drugs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
5. Antiarrhythmic drugs class I (see Section  14.3). 
6. Dopaminergic medications , unless they have been  used at stable doses for at least [ADDRESS_1030177] be established on a contraceptive programme  (see 
inclusion criterion no. 7) . Since the effectiveness of steroidal contraceptives may be reduced when used  
with IMP, alternative or concomitant methods of contraception are recommended  during the trial , and for 
two months after discontinuation of IMP. 
For more information, please refer to the Investigator's Brochure (Section  5.3, Drug -drug interactions ; 
Sections 7 and 12.3 of Modafinil SmPC, and Section 8.1 of Flecainide SmPC ). 
5.6. Lifestyle and Diet

measure height (also used for BMI calculation) . 
6.2.2. Medical history , concomitant  diseases 
In an interview, medical history will be evaluated by [CONTACT_752344].  Concomitant diseases  that 
might be present at VS1 must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Medical conditions that are diagnosed at VS1 will only be documented as adverse events, if they are 
known to have started or are suspected to have started after the ICF has been signed. All other medical 
findings at the medical examina tion at VS1 will be documented as medical history.

6.3.4. Electrocardiogram  (ECG) 
The sponsor will provide the investigator with the ECG device that shall be us ed in this trial. T welve-lead 
ECG will be recorded  after 10 minutes in supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. ECG reading will be performed centrally by [CONTACT_752346] 14.1 and will include  
• ECG measured parameters as intervals (PR, QRS, QT)  
• Pattern of change for PR, QRS and QT versus  ECG from baseline  
• Derived ECG parameters (QTc F, heart rate)  
ECG will be rec orded at VS1, VR, V1B, V1C, V2B, V2C and V3B.  
6.3.5. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS) 
The C-SSRS is a tool that was developed to facilitate a prospective, systematic monitoring for the 
emergence of suicidal tendencies in clinical studies. It is use d to compare the occurrence, severity, and 
frequency of suicide -related thoughts and behavio urs during treatment in a clinical trial.  
The C-SSRS Screening version will be used at VS1 to obtain baseline data . The recall period will be set 
to 12 months / [ADDRESS_1030190] answers “yes” to items 4 and/or 
[ADDRESS_1030191]’s status at VR, V1B, 
V1C, V2B, V2C and V3B. 
Subjects who answer “yes” to point 4 and/or 5 of the C -SSRS will be withdrawn from the trial and will 
be sent for psychiatric consultation . 
6.3.6. Movement Disorder Society -Sponsored Version of Unified 
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale  (MDS-UPDRS) 
The MDS-UPDRS is a comprehensive assessment of both motor and non -motor symptoms associated 
with Parkinson's disease. [33] It has four parts : 
• Part I (non -motor experiences of daily living , 13 items ), further divided into:  
o Part IA focuses on complex behaviors and is  completed by [CONTACT_093], based on interview 
with the subject  
o Part IB focuses on non-motor experiences of daily living and is  completed by [CONTACT_423]  
• Part II (motor experiences of daily living , 13 items ), completed by [CONTACT_423]  
• Part III (motor exa mination, 33 items ), completed by [CONTACT_093]  
• Part IV (motor complications , 6 items) completed by [CONTACT_093], based on interview with the 
subject.  
The MDS -UPDRS rates 65 items  on a 5-point scale: normal (0), slight (1), mild (2), moderate (3) and 
severe (4).  
The MDS -UPDRS will be completed at baseline and at the end of each treatment period , i.e. at visits: VR, 
V1B, V2B and V3B .

Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  6.3.7. Questionnaire for Impulsive -Compulsive Disorders  in Parkinson’s 
Disease – Rating Scale  (QUIP-RS) 
The QUIP -RS is a validated tool designed to  measure the severity of symptoms of impulse control 
disorders (ICDs) and related disorders . [34] The QUIP-RS consists of four primary questions, each applied 
to four ICDs (compulsive gambling, buying, eating and sexual behaviour) and three related disorders 
(medication use, punding and hobby[CONTACT_128053]). The QUIP -RS uses a 5 -point Likert scale (score 0 -4 for each 
question) to rate the severity of each symptom based on its weekly frequency . To be applicable in this 
trial, the standard 4-week recall period will be reduced to one week. 
The total ICD score ranges from [ADDRESS_1030192].  
The QUIP-RS will be completed a t baseline and at the end of each treatment period  (visits: VR, V1B, 
V2B and V3B ). 
6.3.8. Physical examination  
Physical examination includes an examination of the organ systems head, neck, eyes, ear -nose-throat, 
heart, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gast rointestinal, hepatic, urogenital, musculoskeletal, vascular, lymphatic, 
dermatologic, central -nervous system (CNS) and psychiatric.  
6.4. Efficacy Assessments  
6.4.1. Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110]  (ESS) 
The subject will complete the Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] ( ESS, 1-week recall period ). The questionnaire 
will be provided in local language. Site staff will enter ESS data into the eCRF.  
6.4.2. Psychomotor Vigilance Test  (PVT) 
The psychomotor vigilance test is an objective tool used to measure the subject's behavioural alertness. 
[35] It is a visual test which involves measuring  
• Mean response time (ms)  
• Number of lapses  
• Number of total errors  
The PVT requires no training, only  a brief explanation of the procedure to the subject prior to the start of 
the test. It will be performed in the 'on' state.  
PVT will be performed at 10:00 h, 12:00 h, 14:00 h and 16:00 h (± 0:15 h each ). If this PVT assessment 
schedule is too burdensome for the subject, it may be individually ad apted to at least [ADDRESS_1030193].  
The sponsor will provide the investigator with a PVT -192 device to perform a 3 -minutes PVT and a 
notebook computer to read out data.  
6.4.3. Montreal Cognitive Assessment  (MoCA) 
The MoCA  is a brief screening instrument to detect mild cognitive impairment.  It is a paper -and-pencil 
tool that requires approximately 10 minutes and will be administer ed by [CONTACT_093] . It will be 
THN102-202 Clinical Trial Protocol  Page 43 of 74 
Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  performed in the 'on' state. The MoCA  assesses multiple cognitive domains including attention, 
concentration,  executive functions, memory, language, visuospatial skills, abstraction, calculation and 
orientation. One part of the paper questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_423], another par t will be 
completed by [CONTACT_093]. Site staff will enter MoCA data into the eCRF.  
The MoCA questionnaire  will be provided in local language. To decrease possible learning effects , the 
three (equivalent)  versions 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 will be used in alter nation. 
MoCA should be performed  in the morning.  
MoCA scores range between 0 and 30. A score of 26 or over is considered to be normal.  
6.4.4. Actigraphy assessment  
Actigraphy is a non -invasive method of monitoring a person's rest and activity cycles. The movemen ts the 
actigraphy sensor undergoes are continually recorded.  
The sponsor will provide the investigator with actigraphy sensors for the trial subjects and a notebook 
computer to read out data. The actigraphy data will be transferred to  
), where they will be further processed and stored.  
Actigraphy assessments will be performed for [ADDRESS_1030194] diaries are intended for the daily documentation of  
• Get-up time  
• Total time (hours) slept last night 
• Wake-up periods during night sleep  
• Time of drug intake (except screening phase diary)  
• Number of capsules taken (except screening phase diary)  
• Somnolence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  
• Diurnal involuntary sleep attacks  
• Voluntary naps  
• Number of caffeinated drinks  
• Going-to-bed time 
The diaries will be translated in the local languages of the countries involved. Only the subject is allowed 
to make any entry in the diaries. In case of difficulties with writing, however, a caregiver may help.  
The subject will complete four paper  diaries: One screening phase diary (started at VS1, without time of 
IMP intake and number of capsules taken) and treatment phase diaries (started at VR, V1C and V2C) for 
each treatment period. The subject has to bring the diaries for inspection by [CONTACT_752347]. 
The screening phase diary will be collected at VR, the treatment phase diaries will be collected at V1C, 
V2C and V3B.  
Thus, the diaries will be completed continuously from VS1 to V3B, i.e. also during the washout periods 
after treatment periods I and II.

Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  7. ADVERSE EVENT , PREGNANCY  AND EMERGENCY  
7.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
7.1.1. Definition of an adverse event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinic al trial subject administered a medicinal 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
AEs can be symptoms, signs, or clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities occurring during the course 
of the trial. 
All other medical conditions, which are present at VS1, should not be considered as AEs unless a 
worsening in severity or frequency has occurred during the trial. These medical conditions should be 
adequately documented on the appropriate  page of the  eCRF. 
When reporting abnormal laboratory results on the AE pages of the eCRF, a clinical diagnosis should be 
recorded rather than the abnormal value itself if this is available (e.g. “anaemia” rather than “decreased 
red blood cell co unt” or “haemoglobin  = 10.5 g/dL”). 
In case of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is considered 
as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  
7.1.2. Severity assessment  
The investigator must systematically assess the severity  of adverse events  according to the following 
definitions:  
• Mild: a type of adverse event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
• Moderate:  a type of adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses 
no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research partici pant. 
• Severe: a type of adverse event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event interrupts 
usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status. The event possesses a significant 
risk of harm to the research particip ant and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752299].  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented as a new AE . Adverse events  characterised as 
intermittent require s documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
7.1.3. Relationship assessment  
The investiga tor must systematically assess the relationship of adverse events to the IMP using the 
following definitions:  
• Unrelated:  A clinical event with no evidence of any causal relationship.  
• Unlikely:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a  temporal relationship to drug 
administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or 
underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
• Possible:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_113395]. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or u nclear. 
• Probable:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, 
and which follows a clinically reasonable  response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge 
information is not required to fulfil this definition.  
THN102-202 Clinical Trial Protocol  Page 46 of 74 
Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  • Definite: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a plausible time 
relationship to drug administration, and which cannot  be explained by [CONTACT_19009]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically 
plausible. The event must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory 
rechallenge pro cedure if necessary.  
The relationship to IMP can be modified during the trial or AE assessment. For example, although an AE 
may rate only as “possibly” related to IMP soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more 
information and later be upgrad ed to “probably”. Changes in the assessment of relationship to IMP should 
be clearly documented.  
Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_752300] “related” and “unrelated”: The categories “unrelated” and “unlikely” will 
be mapped to “unrelated”, the categories “possible”, “probable” and “definite” will be mapped to 
“related”.  
7.1.4. Procedures for reporting of adverse events  
Assessing of adverse events  
Data on AEs will be obtained at scheduled or unscheduled trial visits, based on information spontaneously 
provided by [CONTACT_3184]/or through questioning of the subject. AE data may also be obtained from 
subject’s diary cards, but information thus collected must be reviewed and assessed medically before it is 
transcribed to the eCRF. 
If a subject is seen by a physician not involve d in the trial because of an adverse event, the investigator 
should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_684118] a timely manner in order to obtain all 
information necessary to appropriate reporting of the event.  
Recording of adverse events  
Complete description of all adverse events must be available in the source documents.  
All AEs including local and systemic reactions should be captured on the appropriate pages of the eCRF.  
Information to be recorded, based on above assessment criteria, includes event description, its duration 
(time of onset and time of resolution), its severity, whether it is considered serious (and if so the criterion 
satisfied), its relationship to IMP, any action taken (concerning the IMP or other) and its outcome.  
Any AE that is still ongoing after final visit will be left as ongoing in the eCRF. However, the investigator 
will continue to follow up ongoing SAEs and record information in the source docume nts and on the 
Follow-Up SAE Form, until resolution or no further improvement can be expected.  
AEs must be recorded on the eCRF according to the following guidelines:  
• Whenever possible, recognised medical terms should be used to describe an AE rather than 
colloquialism (e.g. “influenza” rather than “flu”) and abbreviations should be avoided.  
• The description of an AE should use a specific clinical diagnosis, if this is available, rather than a 
list of component signs or symptoms (e.g. “congestive heart failu re” rather than “dyspnea, rales 
and cyanosis”).  
• Signs and symptoms that are not linked to an identified disease or syndrome, or for which an 
overall diagnosis is not available, should be reported separately, as individual AEs.  
• Provisional diagnosis (e.g. “ suspected myocardial infarction”) is acceptable but should be 
followed up to a definite diagnosis if finally available.  
Reporting of adverse events  
Complete and accurate data on all AEs experienced, for the duration of the reporting period, will be 
reported on an ongoing basis in the AE pages of the eCRF. 
THN102-[ADDRESS_1030196] dose of IMP will be collected until the 
date of final visit , regardless of the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289]. Thereafter, SAEs are not required 
to be reported unless the investigator feels the events wer e related to either IMP administration or to a 
protocol procedure.  
All AEs with onset or worsening after first intake of IMP until [ADDRESS_1030197] -to follow-up, ongoing/u nknown outcome AEs will not be followed up.  
For screening failure subjects, new AEs and updates must be recorded in the source and trial documents 
until the date the subject is determined to be a screening failure. Beyond this date, only SAEs  will be 
followed up by [INVESTIGATOR_30909]’s pharmacovigilance representative.   
7.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
7.2.1. Definition of a serious adverse event   
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE  which at any dose meet s one of the following 
conditions:  
• Death during the period of protocol defined surveillance , i.e. the AE causes or contributes to the 
death. In case of fatality, the cause of death is considered as the AE, and the death is its outcome.  
• Life threatening event (defined as a subject at immediate risk of death at the tim e of the event) , 
i.e. the AE places the subject at immediate risk of death (the definition does not apply to an AE 
that hypothetically might cause death if it was more severe) . 
• An event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752301] , i.e. the AE requires at inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752302] 
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752303].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752304]: surgery planned before trial entry, social reasons, normal disease management 
(including treatment adjustment), if the protocol procedures or the standard management of the 
disease under study requires planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56183] .  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity , i.e. the AE resulted in a substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal activities.  
• Any other important medical condition , i.e. AE that may not immediately result in death , be life 
threatening, or requir e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], but is clearly of major clinical significance. Based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardise the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the serious outcomes listed above. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Any serio us adverse event requires an expedited reporting to the pharmacovigilance  delegate regardless 
of its relationship to the IMP. 
7.2.2. Definitions of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
(S[LOCATION_003]R)  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g. investigator’s brochure for an 
unauthori sed investigational product or summary of product characteristics for an authori sed product).  
THN102-[ADDRESS_1030198] complete the SAE report  form and notify  the CRO’s pharmacovigilance  delegate, 
be it a new SAE or new information on a previously reported SAE (i.e. so-called SAE follow -up), within 
the following timelines:  
• The investigator must report all SAEs to the CRO’s pharmacovigilance delegate within 24 hours 
of identifying the SAE . 
• Other supp orting documentation of the event may be requested by [INVESTIGATOR_30909]’s pharmacovigilance  
delegate and should be provided as so on as possible . 
• All reportable SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the investigator deems 
the event to be chronic or  the subject to be stable.   
The SAE report form  must be sent directly to  the CRO’s pharmacovigilance delegate by [CONTACT_752348]:  
  
 
 
  
 
 
For any new SAE, the following minimum information is required as initial notification:  
• Identification of the investigator,  
• Subject identification details (subject number)  
• IMP details (name, dose(s), route and date(s) of administration, indication)  
• Diagnosis of the event (or an outcome) with the description (or a brief description of signs/ 
symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset  
• Reason(s) for considering the event as serious  
• Relationship of the event with the IMP or with the trial procedure (i.e. the causality according to 
the investigator) . 
Information about SAEs and important medical conditions with any relevant ongoing/unknown outcomes 
will be followed -up until resolution, even if eCRFs and database will no longer be updated. SAEs 
occurring after a subject has taken the last dose of trial drug will be collected until final study visit , 
regardless of the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289]. Thereafter, serious adverse events are n ot required to 
be reported unless the investigator feels the events were related to either IMP administration or a protocol 
procedure.  
7.2.4. Procedures for regulatory reporting of serious adverse events  
Following notification by [CONTACT_093], sponsor or des ignee will report events that are both serious and 
unexpected (i.e. using the current version of the THN102 IB at the time of SAE reporting  as reference) 
and that are associated with IMP  to the competent  authorities ( CAs) in expedited reporting. Unblinding 
will be performed as described in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_1030199] of the clinical trial 
necessitate an expedited reporting to the CAs as well. 

THN102-202 Clinical Trial Protocol  Page 49 of 74 
Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  CAs should be notified of any expedited reporting within the required timelines as speci fied in ICH -E2A: 
fatal and life -threatening events within 7 calendar days (by [CONTACT_648]/fax/writing/electronic commu nication) 
after first knowledge by [INVESTIGATOR_30909]’s pharmacovigilance delegate who will issue a complete report within 8 
additional calendar days, with copy to investigator, CRA, CRO's trial manager, and sponsor. All other 
serious adverse events and S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be fi led in writing within [ADDRESS_1030200] knowledge 
by [INVESTIGATOR_30909]’s pharmacovigilance delegate.   
All serious adverse events will be reported to the CAs in the development safety update report (DSUR) 
annually, if appropriate . 
In accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines, the responsible person for pharmacovigilance  on behalf of 
the sponsor Theranexus will inform the investigators of findings that could affect adversely the safety of 
the subjects, impact the conduct of the trial, or alter the IEC/IRB’s approval/favourable opi[INVESTIGATOR_752305]. 
In particular, sponsor or designee  will inform the investigators of S[LOCATION_003]Rs and serious adverse events that 
are considered to be related to the administered IMP. The investigators w ill keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_86164]  (ISF). National regulations with regards to safety reports notifications 
to investigators will be taken into account.  
Unless clearly defined otherwise by [CONTACT_108103] -specific regul ations and duly documented, the clinical 
CRO will promptly notify the concerned IEC/IRB of any safety reports provided by [CONTACT_752349][INVESTIGATOR_752306]'s 
trial manager.  
7.3. Pregnancy  
Women of childbearing potential (defined as not surgically sterile or less than 2 years postmenopausal), 
must use a highly effective  method of contraception, and must continue for the duration of the trial (and 
for 2 months after participation in the trial). Highly effective  methods of contraception include: hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (combined estrogen/progestogen: oral, intravaginal, 
transdermal ; progestogen -only: oral, implanted, and injected) in conjunction with  a barrier method  
(preferably male condom).  Highly effective methods further include intrauterine device (IUD) , 
intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomised partner (provided 
that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the subject and the vasectomised partner has received medical 
assessment of the surgical success)  and sexual abstinence, i.e. when this is in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject .  
Women o f child-bearing potential will  undergo sensitive urinary pregnancy test s (hCG, human chorionic 
gonadotropin).  
Pregnancy discovered during the clinical trial must lead immediately to exclusion (if at screening ) or 
withdrawal of the subject.  
If the subject has already received IMP, the pregnancy will be documented on a pregnancy report form. 
The case must be reported within 24 hours of knowledge to the CRO’s pharmacovigilance delegate  or the 
CRA. The subjects will be asked to report also pregn ancies within 3 months after (regular or premature) 
termination of the trial to the investigator.  
The investigator must follow up on pregnancies discovered after IMP administration until the end of 
pregnancy to document the outcome on the pregnancy outcome  report form.  
7.4. Emergency  
In case of emergency situations, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_752350] /her assigned CRA, and in case of 
no answer the CRO 's trial manager and/or the sponsor's trial manager.

• The Safety Set (SS) include s all subjects who have received IMP at least once.  
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  includes all randomised subjects with an evaluable ESS score at the end 
of at least one treatment period . The efficacy analyses will be conducted on the FAS. 
• The Per Protocol (PP) set includes all subjects who have completed the trial without major protocol 
deviation.  Major and minor violations will be defined in the SAP.  The main secondary endpoint s 
(ESS, PVT and cognition) will be analysed with the PP set to demonstrate robus tness of the primary 
analysis.  
THN102-202 Clinical Trial Protocol  Page 52 of 74 
Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  • The PK analysis set will include all subjects who have received treatment as per protocol (even if  the 
trial was not completed) and who present no major protocol deviations with an impact on PK.  
 
8.3. Statistical Methods  
Details of the planned analyses will be described in the SAP. Some important features are listed below:  
• For all analyses, the results will be pooled and presented by [CONTACT_396362]. Graphical 
representations will be done for individual subject data and fo r treatment means ± SD over time.  
• Efficacy data will be analy sed according to the treatment as randomised. Safety and pharmacokinetic 
data will be summari sed according to the actual treatment received.  
• Continuous (quantitative) variables will be tabulated using standard descriptive statistics (number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values, for efficacy and some 
safety parameters, with geometric mean and geometric CV ) if appropriate. Continuous variables may 
be categorised into grouped intervals for analysis; in which case frequencies and percentages will also 
be presented.  
• Categorical (qualitative) variables will be tabulated using frequencies and percentages.  
 
8.3.1. Efficacy 
Continuous efficacy endpoints – the change from baseline at each key visit (end of treatment  period I, II, 
and III) in ESS, PVT and MoCA - will be analysed using a mixed linear regression model. The model will 
include the treatment, period, treatment by [CONTACT_632425], sequence, and baseline scores as fixed 
effects, and the subject nested within sequence as a random effect.  
Categorical efficacy endpoints – absence of residual somnolence and ESS responder status  at each key 
visit – will be analysed  using a mixed effects logistic regression model, with the treatment, period, 
treatment by [CONTACT_632425], sequence, and baseline scores as fixed effects, and the subject nested 
within sequence as a random effect.  
Treatment least square means and mean differences will be reported with their standard errors and 95% 
confidence intervals. The significance of the differences between Treatment A (THN102 Placebo), 
Treatment B (THN102 200/2) and Treatment C (THN102 200/18) will be assessed with a contrast t -test 
at the two -sided 5% level.  
Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations: Subjects who misused their planned treatments 
or doses or have missing outcome measurements will not be excluded from the primary analysis in the 
FAS. Under the assumption  that outcomes are missing at random, the mixed -model can propagate 
uncertainty due to missing data into estimates of treatment efficacy and other quantities of interest. Hence, 
missing data will not be imputed or replaced prior to the analysis.  
Supportive  analysis: The same analysis will be repeated on the PP set, to assess robustness of the analysis 
of the variables from ESS and PVT and possibly on other efficacy  results. Subgroup analyses may be 
performed to investigate the effect of the main demographics (age, gender) and disease characteristics (in 
term of daily sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_752289], and cognitive impairment) on the efficacy outcomes.  
The presence of a significant treatment by [CONTACT_752326] a 
residual treatment (carryover) effect. In case of a significant treatment by [CONTACT_632425], period I 
results will be analysed separately, and further a nalyses will be performed to explore the carry -over 
effects. The methods for evaluation of carryover effects  will be defined in the SAP.  
8.3.2. Safety 
Safety parameters will be analysed as follows:  
THN102-202 Clinical Trial Protocol  Page 53 of 74 
Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  Vital signs: All vital signs data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], su bject, and visit/time and will be flagged vs. 
predefined clinical normal range.  The mean value of vital sign parameter assessments  during a visit will 
be summarized . Summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_10659]/time. Shift tables will be 
provided for vital sign abnormality change from baseline to endpoint  within each treatment period . 
ECG parameters: All ECG parameters data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], subject, and visit/time and 
abnormalities will be flagged vs. predefined clinical normal ran ge. Summary statistics will be provided 
by [CONTACT_10659]/time.  
A shift table will be prepared to document QT change and distribution vs. baseline.  
C-SSRS: C-SSRS score data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], subject, and visit/time. Summary statistics wil l 
be provided by [CONTACT_10659]/time.  
QUIP-RS: QUIP-RS score data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], subject and visit/time. Summary statistics will 
be provided by [CONTACT_10659]/time.  
MDS-UPDRS: MDS-UPDRS score data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], subject and visit/time. Summary 
statistics for each part of the MDS -UPDRS as well as the total score will be provided by [CONTACT_103913]/time.  
Clinical laboratory evaluations: All laboratory data will be l isted by [CONTACT_3148], subject, and visit/time 
and abnormalities will be flagged vs. common normal range if considered by [CONTACT_752354]. Summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_10659]/time. Shift tables will be provided for 
clinical laboratory variables’ change from baseline to endpoint.  
Adverse events: All information obtained on adverse events will be displayed by [CONTACT_752355]. All adverse events and related adverse events will be 
presented. The number and percentage of subjects with adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_50110] a breakdown by [CONTACT_3148]. An adverse event starting in one period and continuing 
into the next period is counted only in t he onset period. A subject with multiple adverse events within a 
body system is only counted once towards the total of this body system.  
Concomitant medications / Significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: All concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_752308].  
8.3.3. Pharmacokinetics  
As soon as they are available but only after database has been frozen, analytical determinations will be 
sent by e-mail (Microsoft Excel® file) by [CONTACT_752356]'s 
PK expert  (with copy to Theranexus, CRO's trial manager). All the transmission of data must be done in 
blinded condition up to the reception of the certificate of database lock by [INVESTIGATOR_30909].  
Subsequently, plasma concentrations will be processed for PK data generation.  
For the calculation of the PK parameters and characteristics the following rules are usually applied:  
• All the plasma concentrations validated by [CONTACT_752357] d provided to the 
pharmacokineticist will be used for the PK analysis.  
• The actual blood sampling time points related to the preceding administration will be used.  
• At time points in the lag -time between time zero and the first concentration equal or above L LOQ 
(lower limit of quantification), concentrations below LLOQ will be set to zero. Concentrations 
below LLOQ between two concentrations equal or above LLOQ will be set to half the LLOQ. 
Trailing concentrations below LLOQ will not be used in calculations.  

THN102-202 Clinical Trial Protocol  Page 54 of 74 
Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  • For plasma concentration above the upper limit of quantification and reported as ALQ ( above limit 
of quantification) in the final plasma concentration tables, ALQ will be replaced by [CONTACT_752358].  
• Not reported concentration will be excluded from the PK analysis.  
Plasma concentrations reached at steady state will be presented for modafinil and for flecainide for each 
visit, considering time after last IMP intake. 
Concentration -time data will be listed per treatment and subject  for modafinil and for flecainide. Plasma 
concentrations and time post IMP intake will also be plotted to assess range of exposure at steady state for 
each treatment and to assess reliability of prediction made by [CONTACT_752359] I studies for 
flecainide. 
Further details of the pharmacokinetic analyses will be defined in the SAP.  
8.4. Interim Analysis  
No formal interim analysis is planned . 
8.5. Sample Size Justification  
For the purpose of sample size planning ESS is considered to be the key efficacy endpoint. Solid 
information on the expected difference between placebo and THN102 dose and the associated intrasubject 
variance are not available. Using results reported in Adler et al . [5] as a rough orientation an effect size of 
0.[ADDRESS_1030202] a power of 82% to detect this e ffect size based on a paired t -test

9.1. Good Clinical Practice  
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, good clinical practice ( GCP) and the 
applicable regulatory requirements . 
The procedures set out in this trial protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and documentation of 
this trial, are designed to ensure that investigator s, sponsor, CRO’s pharmacovig ilance delegate, CRAs 
and CRO's trial manager all abide by [CONTACT_752360], ICH guidelines and all applicable international 
and local regulations  as well as the ethical principles laid down in the current revision of the Declaration 
of Helsinki.  
9.2. Delegation of Investigator Responsibilities  
The investigator should ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are adequately informed about all 
relevant trial procedures and well -trained on the protocol, any amendments to the protocol, the trial 
treatments, and their trial -related duties and functions.  
Each investigator should maintain a list of sub -investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to 
whom he/she has delegated significant trial -related duties.  
9.3. Subject Information and Informed C onsent 
Before being admitted to the clinical trial, the subject must consent to participate after the nature, scope, 
and possible consequences of the clinical trial have been explained in a form understandable to him /her. 
An informed consent document that includes both information about the trial and the consent form will 
be prepared and given to the subject. This document will c ontain all elements required by [CONTACT_752361]’s requirements. The document must be in a language understandable to the subject a nd must 
specify who informed the subject.  
After reading the informed consent document, the subject must give consent in writing. The subject's 
consent must be confirmed at the time of consent by [CONTACT_752362] . It is not 
considered appropriate to allow  a subject who is legally  incompetent  to enter this trial under the coverage  
of the subject's legally authoris ed representative . 
A copy of the signed informed consent document must be given to the subject.  
The invest igator will not undertake any measures specifically required for the clinical trial purposes until 
valid consent has been obtained.  
9.4. Confidentiality  
Only the subject number will be recorded in the  eCRF and transfer documents (no initials) , and if the 
subject name [CONTACT_752383] (e.g.  ECG, laboratory report, pathologist report), it must be 
obliterated before a copy of the document is supplied to other parties . The subjects will be told that 
principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_43865]/her staff, CRO’s staff, IEC/IRB, regulatory authorities , and representative s 
of the sponsor may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and that all personal 
information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in  accordance with 
all applicable  data protection laws.  
Biological samples collected during the trial will be used for assay s specifically described in t he protocol . 
The samples will be destroyed after approval of the clinical trial report ( CTR) upon written request.  
The investigator will maintain a personal subject identification list (subject numbers with the 
corresponding subject names) to enable records to be identified.

Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  9.5. Protocol Amendments  
No signee of this protocol ( coordinating investigato r, principal investigator , sponsor), nor the CRO's trial 
manager will alter this trial protocol without obtaining the written agreement of the other  parties. Once 
the trial has started, amendments should be made only in exceptional cases. The changes then become part 
of the trial protocol and request a protocol amendment.  
9.6. Approval of the Trial Protocol and Amendments  
Before the start of the trial, the clinical CRO  will submi t to the IEC/IRBs and the competent authorities 
(CAs) all relevant trial documents . The trial will not start until authorisation by [CONTACT_752363]/IRBs 
have been received in writing  and until the administrative requirements  and workload (grid costs) have 
been discussed with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752309]. 
Trial medication can only be supplied to the investigator after documentation on all ethical and legal 
requirements for starting the trial has been received by [CONTACT_231802]. This documentation must also 
include a list of the members of the IEC/IRB and their occupation and qualifications. The opi[INVESTIGATOR_752310]/IRB should specify the trial title, trial code, trial site, amendment number if appropriate and 
any other documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be 
officially signed by a committee member.  
Before the first subject is enrolled in the trial, all ethical and legal requirements must be met.  
The IEC/IRB and, if app licable, the authorities must be informed of all subsequent protocol amendments, 
in accordance with legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to determine whether formal 
approval must be sought and whether the informed consent document should also b e revised.  
The investigator must keep a record of all communication with the IEC/IRB. This also applies to any 
communication between the investigator and the authorities.  
9.7. Ongoing Information for the Independent Ethics Committee / 
Institutional Review Board  
The responsible IEC/IRB will be informed by [CONTACT_752364].  
Protocol amendments referring to logistical or administrative changes (non substantial) may be 
implemented with notification of the IEC/IRB and competent authority only.  
9.8. Premature Closure of the Trial 
The sponsor (Theranexus ) has the right to close this trial under special considerations or events involving 
safety considerations or issues with recruitment.  As far as possible, this should occur after mutual 
consultation  and attempt of remedy  with all trial sites. The IEC/IRB and the CA must be promptly 
informed.  
Should the trial be closed prematurely, all IMP must be returned to the warehouse , as if the trial had been 
completed.  All other trial material ( actigraphy sensors, PVT device, notebook, ECG device  etc.) must also 
be returned.  
The sponsor reserves the right to close the trial at a site for one of the following (or other) reasons:  
• Non-compliance with GCP and/or regulatory requirements  
• Centre cannot recruit an adequate number of subjects 
• False documentation in the eCRF due to care lessness or deliberation  
THN102-202 Clinical Trial Protocol  Page 57 of 74 
Final 6.0, 27 February 2019 Theranexus S. A.  Confidential  • Inadequate co -operation with the sponsor or its representatives  
If the trial is prematurely terminated at a trial site, all investigators at this trial site have to inform their 
subjects and take care of appropriate follow -up and further treatment of the subjects. IEC/IRBs and the 
CA will be informed according to the applicable laws and regulations.  
9.9. Regular Termination of the Trial 
The end of this trial is defined as the date of the last visit of the last subject undergoing this trial.  
Within 90 days of the end of the clinical trial, the clinical CRO will notify IECs/IRBs and regulatory 
authorities about the regular termination of t he trial as required according to national laws and regulations.  
If the trial has to be terminated early, this period shall be reduced to [ADDRESS_1030203] be retained by t he principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_752311]  (ISF) for 
a minimum of 15 years after the completion or termination of the trial: 
• Signed informed consent documents for all subjects  
• Subject identification list, subject non -eligibility  log and subject enrolment log  
• Record of all communications between the investigator and the IEC/IRB 
• Composition of the IEC/IRB  
• Record of all relevant communications between the investigator and sponsor’s representatives  
• List of sub -investigators and other appropriately  qualified persons to whom the investigator has 
delegated significant trial -related duties, together with their roles and their signatures  
• Copi[INVESTIGATOR_449318]  
• Drug accountability records  
• Record of any body fluids or tissue samples retained  
• All other source documents (patient records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory records, worksheets etc.)  
• All other documents as listed in Section  8 of the ICH consolidated guideline on GCP (Essential 
Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial)  
However, because of international regulatory requirements, Theranexus  may request retention for a longer 
period of time. The investigator must therefore obtain approval in writing from Theranexus or from  the 
CRO's trial manager prior to destruction of any records.  
Normally, these records will be held in the investigator's archives. If the investigator is unable to meet this 
obligation, he must ask Theranexus  for permission to make alternative arrangements. Details of these 
arrangements should be documented.  
9.11. Liability and Insurance  
In accordance with GCP and ICH guidelines, the  clinical CRO  (authorised by [CONTACT_456]) has subscribed 
to an insurance policy covering, in its terms and provisions, its legal liability for injuries caused to 
participating persons and arising out of this research performed strictly in accordance with the scientific 
protocol as well as with ap plicable law and professional standards.  
The insurance certificate will be submitted with the documents to the IEC/IRB.

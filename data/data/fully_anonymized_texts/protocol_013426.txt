(CD8 PET Tracer) and its associated PET/CT scan.  
• If biopsy will be  performed  after the PET/CT scan (either Baseline or On -treatment) , image guided biopsy 
will be the preferred  method , where the lesion is chosen based on CD8+ PET signal on the CD8 PET/CT 
scan.  
• The need for the Baseline biopsy will be considered on a case by [CONTACT_770323].  
• If a patient has had a diagnostic biopsy within 2 months  (60 days)  prior to the 1st infusion of 89Zr-Df-
IAB22M2C  (CD8 PET Tracer) , the archival tissue can be submitted for IHC analysis, with approval of 
the Sponsor, provided the specimen is of adequate quality and the biopsy was obtained from a lesion that 
is RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1057173]/MRI . If these conditions 
are met,  then the patient can be exempt from the Baseline biopsy.  
• Archival tumor tissue must have been obtained after last systemic therapy. The lesion from which the 
archival tissue is obtained should not have received radiation post -biopsy.  
• For the 2nd biopsy (within 2 weeks after 2nd infusion of 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C  [CD8 PET Tracer ] and 
PET/CT scan), optional surgical resection may be performed in place of biopsy if investigator determines 
the tumor as resectable . 
• Assuming a correlation between Tumor SUVmax to SUVmean Aorta reference tissues and CD8+  cell 
measurements by [CONTACT_762579] 0.65, 47 patients will be needed to obtain a width of 0.30. The 95% confidence 
interval is 0.47 -0.78, which would be in the range of a good correlation .

Statistical Considerations:   
All collected study data will be presented in subject data listings. Statistical analyses will be performed using 
SAS® for Windows, version 9.4 or later. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum 
and maximum) will be presented for continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages will be presented for 
categorical variables.  
Sample Size Determination and Rationale  
The sample size calculation is based on the co -primary outcome measure of correlation of 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C 
(CD8 PET Tracer) uptake as determined by [CONTACT_770324]8+ 
cell measurement as determined by [CONTACT_770325]. Since there are no validated comparator studies 
or imaging scans that can serve as reference values scans for CD8+ cell count , the objective of this study is to 
estimate the correlation between CD8+ cells and quantitative uptake by [CONTACT_770326].  
The objective is to estimate the Spearman’s correlation coefficient with a 0.30 width (width of the 95% 
confidence interval calculated based on Bonett and Wright (2000) method). The sample size is adjusted for 
intra-patient correlation assuming two observa tions per patient (baseline and on -treatment) and a moderate 
intra-patient correlation of 0.30 (plausible as patients will receive treatment between the two observations). 
Assuming a correlation between Tumor SUVmax to SUVmean Aorta reference tissue and CD 8+ cell 
measurements of 0.65, 47 patients will be needed to obtain a width of 0.30. The 95% confidence interval is 
0.47-0.78, which would be in the range of a good correlation. If the estimated correlation is 0.75, the 95% 
confidence interval becomes 0.61 -0.85 (width = 0.24). If the estimated correlation is 0.50, the 95% confidence 
interval becomes 0.29 -0.66 (width = 0.37 ). 
 
Analysis Populations  
Efficacy population  
The efficacy population is defined as all subjects who have received at least one dose of study imaging agent 
and have at least one CD8 PET scan of adequate quality and corresponding core biopsy samples of adequate 
quality from at least one location.  
For correlating treatment -related change in PET signal with change in CD8+ cell measurements on IHC: 
Efficacy population is defined as all subjects who have paired Baseline and On -treatment CD8 PET scans and 
corresponding paired biopsy samples.  
Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The Per Protocol (PP) population is defined as the set of subjects who meet the efficacy population 
requirements and  were not associated with a major protocol violation. This population will be identified before 
the database lock.    
Safety Population  
The Safety population is defined as all subjects receiving at least one dose of the study imaging agent.  
Analysis Methods:   
The primary analysis of the primary and secondary outcome measures will be conducted using the PP 
population. Analyses of safety outcomes will be conducted using safety population.  
Safety Analysis:  
Analyses of safety outcomes will be conducted using the safety population.  
 
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA. Treatment Emergent AE’s (TEAE) are defined as events with 
an onset on or after the first treatment. TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_770327], System Organ Class, and preferred term. The following TEAE summaries will be provided:  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_86953]  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_78487].

Protocol Number:  
IAB-CD8 -201 Indication: Patients with Selected Advanced and 
Metastatic Solid Tumors including Melanoma, Non-
Small  Cell Lung Cancer, Renal Cell Carcinoma, 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck , 
Colorectal Cancer -MSI high , Triple Negative Breast, 
Bladder , Cervical , and Esophag ogastric  Cancers 
In addition, separate summaries of serious adverse events, and adverse events resulting in discontinuation of 
study treatment will be presented.  
The first co -primary objective is the evaluation of the safety of repeat doses of 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C (CD8 PET 
Tracer). Adverse events will be graded using CTCAEv5. All grades will be tabulated overall and by [CONTACT_770328] (1st injection vs 2nd injection). Considering that the safety profile of one dose has been established 
before, no severe (grade ≥3) events are expected, but safety will be closely monitored and safety data will be 
reviewed by a data safety committee.  
In addition, all the data from physical examination, 12 -Lead ECG , Serum chemistry, hematology, and vital 
signs will also be descriptively summarized.  
Efficacy Analysis:   
The primary analysis of the primary and secondary outcome measures will be conducted using the PP 
population.  
For the efficacy outcome measures , the data will be summarized and compared according to the variable type.  
Continuous data summaries will include:  
• Descriptive summary of number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, 1st and 3rd quartile 
and minimum and maximum values.  
• Inferential statistics include:  
o Pearson correlations  
o T-test or ANCOVA using the baseline value as a covariate, if the Normality assumption is 
met 
o non-parametric or rank based analysis, if the Normality assumption is not met.  
Categorical data summaries will include:  
• Frequency counts and percentages.  
• Chi square test or Logit model for inferential statistics.  
 
To establish the relationship of the PET/CT uptake with CD8+ cells (the second co -primary objective), the 
main analysis will be the Spearman’s correlation coefficient between Tumor SUVmax  to Aorta reference tissue  
and CD8+ cells value at all times (baseline and post -treatment). The correlation will then be estimated using 
SUVpeak, SUVmean, CD8 tumor volume (defined as the volume of tumor tissue with SUV > 40% of 
SUVmax), and other tumor: reference ratio. The correlation will be given with a two -sided 95% co nfidence 
interval accounting for clustering with subjects as clusters (as most subjects will have measurements at 2 
times). Those analyses will be repeated separately at baseline and post -treatment as exploratory analyses.  
The first 15 to 20 patients might be described during the study in order to check the technical quality of the 
data and the imaging. This description will not allow for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356], no statistical inference will be done, 
and therefore no type -I erro r is spent at this stage.

3 Background/Rationale and Purpose  
 
3.[ADDRESS_451829] diabetes, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for 
90-95% of all diagnosed cases. The number of adults diagnosed with diabetes has more than doubled in 
the last [ADDRESS_451830] long been recognized as a critical component of diabetes care and 
management. Current guidance from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical 
Care (SOC) states there is no “one -size-fits-all” eating pattern, or ideal macronutrient distribution, that 
works for all people with diabetes.2 A variety of eating patterns (e.g., Mediterranean, very -low-
carbohydrate, vegetarian) have demonstrated  good efficacy for people with diabetes (PWD). However, 
evidence suggests all healthy eating patterns should emphasize non -starchy vegetables, minimal added 
sugars and refined grains, and whole foods over highly processed foods whenever possible. Reducing 
overall carbohydrate intake has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia in people with 
T2D and should be considered with emphasis on the aforementioned components of healthy eating 
pattern.[ADDRESS_451831] their glucose by [CONTACT_362852], which is also called blood glucose monitoring (BGM). Continuous glucose 
monitoring (CGM), which tracks glucose continually over time is also an option. However, as of 2022, 
CGM is only re commended in the ADA SOC for PWD who require insulin.    
 
CGM vs. BGM to Optimize Glycemic Outcomes in T2D Following the Virta Treatment Ver. 2.[ADDRESS_451832] that CGM may lead to greater improvements in glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) compared to usual care, which is often BGM.3,4 CGM studies in PWD who do not 
use insulin are sparse; however, Jackson et al conducted a review of the available data and reported 
CGM may improve glycemic outcomes in PWD not using insulin and may have the potential to improve 
lifestyle changes and adher ence to diabetes treatments.[ADDRESS_451833] there is 
evidence that CGM provides benefits to PWD who are treated with less -intensive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; they 
present data showing that behavioral interventions that use CGM improve dietary habit s, physical 
activity, bodyweight, and problem -solving skills.[ADDRESS_451834] for assessing glycemia, the HbA1c does not provide a clear pi[INVESTIGATOR_362843] - and/or hypo -glycemia. The 2022 ADA SOC recognizes that 
CGM can provide better insights into more personalized diabetes care, and they call out ten core metrics 
that should be consider ed when evaluating CGM data. There is specific emphasis on time in range (TIR), 
the goal of which for most PWD is 70% of time in the target glucose range of 70 -180mg/dL.[ADDRESS_451835] T IR is also correlated with 
risk of diabetes -related complications.9  
 
Two recent randomized controlled trials in PWD who were treated with basal insulin10 or less intensive 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]11 showed that use of CGM improves TIR by [CONTACT_2902] 15%, which is noteworthy w hen considering 
a 5% improvement in TIR is considered clinically meaningful.12 CGM’s immediate feedback on current 
glucose levels and the retrospective review of glucose patterns from CGM reports may help optimize 
diabetes therapy, including dietary change s. The value of CGM for making nutrition and lifestyle 
modifications has strong potential, but it needs further research, which could lead to expanded 
indications for CGM for people with T2D.  
 
Very few nutrition intervention studies have used CGM technolo gy to guide the intervention in people 
with T2D. Griauzde et al provided intermittent access to CGM as part of a low -carbohydrate intervention 
(< 100 g carbohydrate per day) and found that HbA1c decreased by 0.4% more than a comparison group 
who received u sual care without CGM; they also showed that TIR increased by [CONTACT_34120] 18% over 12 
months in the group that was using CGM.13 Similarly, Oser et al showed that CGM was an effective 
educational and motivational tool in a study of 17 people with newly diagnosed  T2D who used CGM as 
part of a nutrition -focused lifestyle intervention that emphasized carbohydrate restriction to minimize 
glycemic excursions.14 In this study, 67% of participants achieved HbA1c < 6.5% without diabetes 
medications and 80% of the partici pants showed an HbA1c reduction of 2.3% + 1.3%. While both studies 
appear promising, neither are randomized controlled trials with an adequate comparison group and 
neither of these studies evaluated TIR as a primary outcome.  
 
All people with T2D are encour aged to adopt lifestyle modifications focusing on eating patterns, physical 
activity, and weight management to improve their health. Treatment for people with T2D at Virta Health 
includes an individualized, remotely delivered, lifestyle -based intervention emphasizing a carbohydrate -
restricted diet to induce nutritional ketosis.  
 
Enrollment in the Virta Treatment is contingent on medical approval from the Virta HCP. Upon 
enrollment, participants receive introductory educational resources and an appointment with a health 
coach. Treatment at Virta includes guidance on the use of a well -formulated, ketogenic diet (WFKD), 
biometric feedback, behavior change support, optional peer support, and medication management

 (referred to as the “Virta Treatment”). The WFKD  is a carbohydrate -restricted, moderate -protein, 
nutrient -dense eating pattern that emphasizes whole foods, including a variety of low -carbohydrate 
vegetables.  Health coaches provide frequent nutritional guidance and troubleshooting while healthcare 
provi ders (HCPs), physicians and nurse practitioners, provide medication management and medical 
oversight. As participants begin dietary changes, blood glucose declines and diabetes medications are 
titrated to match emerging glycemic patterns; this typi[INVESTIGATOR_362844].  
 
In response to carbohydrate restriction with moderate protein intake, blood ketones rise, and a state of 
nutritional ketosis can be achieved. Blood ketones, therefore, serve as a marker of carbohydrate and 
protein intak e and can be utilized as a marker of adherence to a carbohydrate -restricted, ketogenic 
diet.[ADDRESS_451836] of Virta Treatment has been evaluated in a non -randomized, controlled intervention trial. In 
brief, 262 adults  with a mean age of 54 years, a mean time with T2D of 8.4 years, and a mean baseline 
A1c of 7.5% underwent Virta’s nutrition intervention and continuous care plan. The comparison group 
received usual diabetes care, including standard dietary advice, outsid e of Virta. The trial showed that 
the impact of Virta’s intervention on diabetes -related health parameters is rapid, with an average of 1% 
reduction in HbA1c, a reduction in or elimination of diabetes medications, and a clinically meaningful 
weight loss fo r most participants at 10 weeks.18 Importantly, HCP oversight allowed for diabetes 
medication changes to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in patients taking medications that are prone to 
hypoglycemia. Of those taking insulin or sulfonylureas at baseline, 87 % and 93%, respectively, had 
medications either stopped or doses reduced by 10 -weeks. Similar or improved results persisted after 
one19 and two20 years of trial participation. Notably, the retention rate throughout the trial was high: 
91% at 10 -weeks, 83% at 1-year, and 74% at [ADDRESS_451837] lifestyle modification programs for PWD, the Virta Treatment relies on BGM by 
[CONTACT_171254]; however, dietary adoption and adherence to the Virta Treatment may be enhanced by [CONTACT_362853]. T herefore, the following protocol describes a randomized, controlled trial 
intended to assess whether the addition of CGM into Virta’s clinical care plan improves TIR, glycemia, 
and adherence to nutrition therapy as evidenced by [CONTACT_362854].   
 
3.2 Rationale and Purpose  
 
The purpose of this three -month, randomized, controlled trial is to compare the difference in change in 
14-day CGM -derived TIR (% time with glucose 70 ‑180 mg/dL) from Baseline to  3-months Post -Dietary 
Change in participants with T2D who are assigned to use either BGM or CGM. The difference in mean 
blood ketone levels and additional glycemic endpoints will also be compared, and several exploratory 
endpoints, including medication cha nges, dietary intake, and body weight will be described.  
 
The study also includes a three -month Follow -Up period (months three to six), where participants will 
remain using their randomly assigned glucose monitoring modality (e.g., BGM or CGM); this perio d will 
help assess durability of the results found during the intervention.    
 
This study will provide insights into how continuous feedback from CGM affects glycemic outcomes, 
such as TIR and HbA1c, compared to the standard method of BGM. It is important  to understand if the

reported very -low carbohydrate diet or currently using a personal CGM. Those who continue to meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and who express interest in study participation will be contact[CONTACT_362857], complete additional 
screening questions, answer questions, and obtain informed consent as appropriate.

Page 14 of 34 
 Up to 2,000 free -living adults with T2D may be invited to participate in this study, and approximately 
200 participants will be consented; this is based on the following assumptions 1) approximately 10% of 
people choose to volunteer to participate in research 2) some participants (estimate up to 50 people) 
will consent, but may withdraw before being randomized and therefore will ne ed to be replaced and 3) 
approximately 15% attrition is expected for the randomized participants within the [ADDRESS_451853] obtain Virta’s standard medical approval from a Virta HCP and meet all eligibi lity 
criteria, as defined in Section 6, to participate in the study. Once the informed consent form (ICF) has 
been signed, the participant is formally enrolled in the study and a participant ID number will be 
assigned and recorded in the shared Virta and I DC study database (REDCap). Participants will be 
randomized 1:1 to either the BGM or CGM arm (Table 1) once a minimum of five days of blinded Libre 
Pro CGM data is confirmed by [CONTACT_2299]. Of note, the blinded Libre Pro CGM system provides a 
way for t he participant to see the number of days of data recording while the sensor is in use. If a 
participant wears a blinded Libre Pro CGM at baseline that does not capture at least [ADDRESS_451854] additional blinded CGM data.  
 
Blinding procedures are not described since blinding i s not possible in a study comparing two different 
methods of glucose monitoring (BGM versus CGM); the participants will know which arm they are 
assigned to in order to conduct the appropriate monitoring.  
 
Given that enrolling participants takes several mon ths to complete, a block randomization scheme will 
be used to ensure that participants are assigned to BGM and CGM arms in approximately equal 
proportions each month. The participant randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_362858]. Participants will remain in their assigned study 
arm throughout the intervention and follow -up period (day 0 to day 194).

[ADDRESS_451855] of two glucose monitoring methods, BGM or CGM, as part of 
Virta Health’s diabetes care program. All care and education are provided via telemedicine (i.e., 
virtually) and with the use of web -based software applicati ons for biomarker reporting, monitoring, and 
communication with Virta’s care team.  
 
As part of standard Virta Treatment, participants will receive continuous coaching from the Virta care 
team that focuses on modifying daily nutrition choices to achieve an d sustain nutritional ketosis as 
measured by [CONTACT_362859] 0.5 -3.0 mmol/L. The care team includes health coaches for day -to-day program 
guidance and HCPs for medication management and clinical oversight. Virta HCPs review glucose values 
reported by [CONTACT_3445] s in the Virta app. HCPs make proactive and reactive medication dose 
adjustments to prevent hypoglycemia while participants are experiencing metabolic improvements. 
Care for Virta participants is provided continuously and is not limited by [CONTACT_362860] (e.g., 
appointments are not at scheduled timepoints).  
 
The current Virta Treatment relies on BGM for glucose assessment and does not supply CGMs as part of 
routine care. Thus, the intervention under study is use of CGM compared to BGM (Virta’s cu rrent 
standard care) for glucose monitoring.  
 
In the BGM arm , participants, health coaches, and Virta HCPs will use BGM and ketone data to guide 
medication management decisions and to encourage program adherence, per their usual practices. The 
blinded Libr e Pro CGM data collected at baseline and during the intervention and follow -up periods will 
not be available to participants or the Virta care team; however, data from the blinded Libre Pro CGM 
assessments can be made available to BGM arm participants afte r study completion, upon request from 
the participant. BGM and ketone data will be used to help determine which foods, behaviors, and 
medications sustain nutritional ketosis. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_362845]’s medication regimen. Fingerstick 
data is reported in the Virta app by [CONTACT_2299].  
   
In the CGM arm , participants receive Virta’s usual care except instead of using BGM, participants, health 
coaches, an d Virta HCPs will use real -time and retrospective CGM and ketone data to guide medication 
management decisions and to encourage program adherence. Emphasis will be placed on guiding 
participants to use the CGM device and its associated data to determine wh ich foods, behaviors, and 
medications help them achieve CGM glucose targets and sustain nutritional ketosis. Glucose target 
ranges will be individualized for each participant and use of CGM alarms to alert participants of high or 
low glucose will be indivi dualized based on a shared decision -making approach that aligns with current 
guidance on providing technology -enabled diabetes care. Virta Health coaches will consider CGM data 
during participant contact [INVESTIGATOR_81730], and HCPs will systematically assess CGM d ata during the defined 
Contact [CONTACT_362861]. IDC will provide 
minimal participant support for technical CGM -related issues.

8.2           Baseline Assessments  
 
After signing the ICF, demographic and anthropometric information will be assessed to describe the  
participants. Age at enrollment, race, ethnicity, income, education, marital status, year of type 2 
diagnosis, gender identity, biological sex, weight, height, etc. will be collected at baseline.  
 
Baseline assessments also include a 14 -day, blinded CGM as sessment using the FreeStyle Libre Pro 
system. The FreeStyle Libre Pro system (sensor and reader) is commercially available and will be used 
according to user manual instructions; however, the system will be started at home by [CONTACT_362862]  a clinic with an HCP. The sensor will be returned to the clinical site for data download. A 
minimum of five days of blinded Libre Pro CGM sensor data must be obtained for randomization. 
Participants will use the provided reader to confirm adequate days of  data recording during the Baseline 
assessment period.  
 
All 14 -day, blinded, FreeStyle Libre Pro sensors will be returned via mail. Data will be uploaded with a 
FreeStyle  Libre Pro reader using the Libre 2 algorithm and then downloaded to secure study computer. 
Blinded FreeStyle Libre Pro sensors will be tracked by [CONTACT_362863].  
 
Once baseline assessments are complete, th e study intervention (use of CGM vs. BGM) begins 
concurrently with the initiation of the WFKD (Day 0).  
 
8.3        Outcome Assessments  
 
Outcome -related measures will be assessed at Baseline, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, and Month 6. 
Primary and secondary outcome  assessments will occur after the intervention, the “Post -Dietary 
Change” period, which is approximately Day 90 to 104.  Additional secondary and exploratory outcome 
assessments will occur after “Follow -Up” period, which is approximately Day [ADDRESS_451857] Periods between study staff (Virta and IDC) and study 
participants (“Baseline”, “Month 1”, “Month 2”, “Month 3”, and “Month 6”). Each Contact [CONTACT_362864], to accommodate the 14-day sensor wear. Required assessments 
can take place anytime during the Contact [CONTACT_29621]. Each Contact [CONTACT_362865] a plus or minus 10 or 14 
day window, depending on the period; however, this should minimally impact the length of study 
participation si nce assessment windows are set according to initiation of the WFKD at Day 0. For 
example, assessment activities during Contact [CONTACT_362866] 20 or end as late as 
Day 54 and be in -window; and the target start date for Contact [CONTACT_362867] [ADDRESS_451858] Period Two was completed.

9        Early Termination and Participant Withdrawal  
 
A participant can choose to terminate study participation and exit the study at any time and for any 
reason. A participant can be withdrawn from the study without their consent if deemed necessary based 
on adverse event(s) or for any other reason deemed ap propriate by [CONTACT_4718], such as non -
compliance with study instructions. If a participant chooses early termination or is withdrawn, the 
Investigators will decide whether the participant could be eligible to complete a final assessment.  
 
Participants w ill be asked their reason for early withdrawal and reason for CGM discontinuation if 
applicable. Participants who terminate or are withdrawn early will be required to return used blinded 
Libre Pro CGM sensors and the associated Libre Pro reader promptly af ter study exit; they will not be 
required to return any other study -provided glucose or ketone monitoring supplies. Early termination or 
participant withdrawal will not impact participation in the Virta Treatment.

 fingerstick testing are minimal and may include pain, bruising, or the infrequent occurrence of skin 
infection.  
 
CGM use  
 
CGM use is a ro utine part of the care for many PWD. CGM users usually report less pain or discomfort 
with CGM than with capi[INVESTIGATOR_362846]. Mild pain on insertion of CGM may be experienced 
by [CONTACT_362875]. Known allergies to medical grade adhesi ves is an exclusion from 
participation. Cutaneous complications of CGM use are typi[INVESTIGATOR_362847] -related erythema, itching, and 
induration. The incidence of these complications is expected to be low, 0.13 to 0.15 events per week of 
wear -time, with the majorit y (79%) being mild. Study discontinuation rate due to skin reactions is 
expected to be very low.[ADDRESS_451867] 
personal information, including use of de -identified participant identification (ID) numbers whenever 
possible.  
 
Surveys  
 
Surveys will be used to collect information on food intake and other PROs. Sometimes survey questions 
can trigger uncomfortable feelings. Participants will be informed that they are not required to respond 
to questions that make them uncomfortable for what ever reason.

outcomes.   
 
13     Assessment of Safety and Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
 
13.1   Definitions  
 
The following definitions will be used in the assessment of safety:  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom or disease temporally associated with the intervention, regardless of whether it is conside red 
related to the intervention.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any adverse event that  
(1) results in death;  
(2) is life -threatening;  
(3) results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
(4) results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
(5) results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
(6) based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant's health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes liste d in this 
definition.  
 
Life-threatening  means the event places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred.  
 
Unanticipated Event  (UAE)  is defined as an event, experience or outcome that meets all three  of the 
following criteria:  
● is unexpected ; AND  
● is related or possibly related  to participation in the research; AND  
● suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk  of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Unexpected means the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with either:  
● the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the 
research that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol, the ICF, and/or other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and 
package ins erts 
● the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition for the 
participant experiencing the adverse event, and/or the participant’s predisposing risk factor 
profile for the adverse event.  
  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) means:  
● any problem or event which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_362848], serious; AND  
● at least possibly related to the research procedures   
 
CGM vs. BGM to Optimize Glycemic Outcomes in T2D Following the Virta Treatment Ver. 2.[ADDRESS_451869] been caused by [CONTACT_3459].  
 
Minimal risk  means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the 
research are  not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during 
the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.  
 
Severity of events  will be defined as:  
• Mild requires minimal or no treatment and does not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate results in a low level of inconvenience or concern with therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with the participant’s func tioning.  
• Severe interrupts a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment.  
 
13.2     Safety Review  
 
Risks described in section 12.1, AEs, SAEs, and UAEs will be monitored continuously throughout the 
study by [CONTACT_464].  
 
13.3     Reporting Plans  
 
The delegated Investigator will report all reportable AEs, SAEs, UAEs, and UPI[INVESTIGATOR_362849].  
 
AE’s are considered reportable if they meet any of the following:  
● Severe sensor -related reactions or infections requiring in -person medical care  
● Severe hypoglycemia defined as requiring assistance of another person due to alt ered 
consciousness, and requiring another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or 
other resuscitative actions.  
● Severe hyperglycemia if the event involves diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar 
hyperglycemic state (HHS), as defined in Kitabchi et al.25  
 
Reportable AEs and all SAEs will be recorded within an adverse event log with a description including the 
nature of the event, the date and time of onset and/or frequency, determination of non -serious versus 
serious, intensity (mild, moderate, severe), duration of the event, relationship to the intervention, the 
expectedness, and outcome of the event.  
 
This stud y does not include an independent monitoring committee (e.g., no Data Safety Monitoring 
Board). Since the study procedures are of minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any UAEs related to the 
research and involving risks to subjects or others happen duri ng this study (including SAEs), they will be 
reported to the IRB in accordance with Advarra IRB standard operating procedure (SOP).

[CONTACT_362876], 2) in Virta’s HIPAA compliant EMR and patient -facing app (the mobile interface 
where patients interact with the care team), 3) fro m the Libre Pro reader and LibreView website , 4) in 
REDCap, 5) via the web -based ASA24 and 6) in electronic files on secured, password protected 
institutional computers.  
 
CGM -related data will either be uploaded directly from the blinded Libre Pro reader  and then 
downloaded to an institutional computer or downloaded from the LibreView website (for participants 
assigned to the CGM arm). CGM data will be saved on password -protected computers, which are backed 
up to a secure server. Participants assigned to the CGM arm will need to create a personal account in 
order to access the phone -based app associated with the FreeStyle Libre [ADDRESS_451871] protection and internal quality checks, 
including field validation to help identify inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate data. Data entered into 
REDCap will come directly from the original source data; or in some cases REDCap will serve as the 
source data (e.g. protocol deviations; tracking participant phone calls between participants and IDC 
staff; when participants respond to surveys directl y in REDCap; etc.). REDCap maintains a built -in audit 
trail that logs all user activity and all pages viewed by [CONTACT_362877], this includes entering data, exporting 
data, modifying a field, running a report, or add/modifying a user, etc.  
 
Participants will c omplete surveys directly in REDCap and directly in ASA24. ASA24 is a free, web -based 
dietary assessment tool that is run by [CONTACT_7681]. ASA24 data is associated with 
study ID and does not capture any personally identifiable informati on from participants. All completed 
surveys will be retained in the web -based server as a source document and will also be downloaded 
from the servers and stored as .CSV or similar files throughout the study.   
 
This trial will be registered at ClinicalTri als.gov once the protocol has been approved by [CONTACT_1201]; trial 
results will be added to the ClinicalTrials.gov after study completion.  
 
14.1       Data Monitoring  
 
Investigators and study staff will periodically monitor data for completeness and quality as specified in 
data -sharing contracts and to provide the opportunity to address any concerns.  
 
14.2      Confidentiality  
 
Participants will be assigned a unique ID number at the time of enrollment. Whenever possible, 
participant records and datasets will contain the unique ID only. The participant will be informed during

[CONTACT_362878]. Participant data and any related records 
may also be made accessible to regulatory authorities or as required by [CONTACT_2371].  
 
The confidentiality of al l participant information and data are protected to the extent allowed by [CONTACT_2371]. 
Records will be kept confidential in accordance with HIPAA privacy regulations. Investigators and 
personnel will not use data or records for any purpose other than conducting th e study; however, 
deidentified participant data may be used for educational purposes and shared in medical journals, at 
scientific meetings, or in similar settings. No identifiable data will be used for future study without first 
obtaining IRB approval. In  the case a limited data set is needed for future study, a data use agreement 
will be utilized.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_451872] retention period 
has been met, all study -related materials are destroyed. Once a study is terminated in CIRBI (Center for 
IRB Intellig ence), the study is automatically archived in the system for the retention period noted above. 
Prior to purging study documentation/information from CIRBI (i.e., studies that have met the retention 
period), CIRBI sends out an automated notification to the study contacts. The notification instructs the 
study contacts to log in to CIRBI and retrieve any documentation/information needed within 30 days of 
the notification. After the 30 -day period, all documentation/information is purged from CIRBI.  
 
All HIPAA -related documents containing PHI collected by [CONTACT_362879], will be retained for at least six years 
after completion of the study. Physical documents will be consolidated and stored in boxes in a secure 
location after study completion and electronic documents wi ll be maintained in designated research 
study folders on the institutional drive in accordance with the HealthPartners data retention guidelines.  
 
15 Statistical Plan  
 
15.1       Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
 
Summary statistics (including number, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) for 
percentage (%) of TIR (glucose 70 - 180 mg/dL), based on 14 -day CGM assessments, will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_44479].  
 
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a linear mixed model with treatme nt (BGM or CGM), period 
(Baseline (period A) and Post -Dietary Change (period B)), and interaction between treatment and period 
as fixed effects, and patient as random effect. The model will be fitted to all the data simultaneously and 
from this model the r elevant treatment differences will be estimated. Adjusted mean estimates for each 
treatment with standard errors, the adjusted estimate of treatment mean difference with standard 
error and a 95 % confidence interval for the treatment mean difference will b e provided. The statistical 
test will be two -sided tests at a nominal 5% significance level.

15.2      Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
Summary statistics (including number, mean, median, standard deviation, min imum and maximum for a 
continuous variable, or % at each level for a categorical variable) of each secondary endpoint, will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_44479].  
 
Mean blood ketone levels at month 3: Mean blood ketone levels at month 3 will be calculated as 
average of all fingerstick BHB levels from day 0 to 90. Mean blood ketones levels will be analyzed using a 
linear regression model with treatment (BGM or CGM) as the effect variable.  
 
Change in other CGM -derived metrics and A1c: These metrics include pe rcent (%) of time with glucose 
above 180 mg/dL, above 250 mg/dL, below 70 mg/dL, and below 54 mg/dL based on 14 -day CGM during 
Baseline (period A) and Post -Dietary Change (period B). These metrics also include measures of mean 
and variation in glucose prof iles: mean glucose, % coefficient of variation, mean amplitude of glucose 
excursion (MAGE) based on 14 -day CGM during Baseline (period A) and Post -Dietary Change (period B). 
Change in A1c during Baseline and Post -Dietary Change period is also included and evaluated here.  
 
All secondary endpoints will be analyzed using linear mixed models with treatment (BGM or CGM), 
period (Baseline (period A) and Post -Dietary Change (period B)), and interaction between treatment and 
period as fixed effects, and patient as random effect. An alyses of such models are similar to the analysis 
for the primary endpoint.  
 
Reaching CGM -derived consensus targets at month 3: This includes percent (%) of time with glucose 
>250 mg/dL <5% (yes/no); percent (%) of time in glucose >180 mg/dL <25% (yes/no);  percent (%) of time 
in glucose 70 -180 >70% (yes/no); percent (%) of time in glucose <70 mg/dL <4% (yes/no); percent (%) of 
time in glucose <54 mg/dL <1% (yes/no); percent (%) of time in glucose 70 -180 AND percent (%) of time 
in glucose <70 mg/dL <4% (yes/ no); percent (%) of time in glucose 70 -180 AND percent (%) of time in 
glucose <54 mg/dL <1% (yes/no) based on [ADDRESS_451874] -Dietary Change (period B).  
 
Since each endpoint is a dichotomous variable indicating if a patient reaches the consensus target goal  
at month 3 (yes/no), they will be analyzed using logistic regression models with treatment (BGM or 
CGM) as the effect variable.  
 
15.3     Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
 
Analysis of exploratory endpoints is descriptive (including number, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum and maximum for a continuous variable, or % at each level for a categorical variable). A 95% 
confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for each endpoint, but no hypothesis testing or inferential 
analysis will be conducted due to the exploratory nature of these variables.  
 
15.4    Study Hypotheses  
 
Alternative primary hypothesis: CGM will lead to greater improvements in TIR at month three compared 
to BGM in people with T2D who participate in the Virta Treatment.  
CGM vs. BGM to Optimize Glycemic Outcomes in T2D Following the Virta Treatment Ver. 2.0 06Dec2022  
 
Page 27 of 34 
  
Alternative secondary hypotheses:  
● CGM will lead to greater blood ketone levels at month three (a presumed marker of adherence 
to the Virta dietary plan) compared to BGM in people with T2D who participate in the Virta 
Treatment.  
● CGM will lead to greater imp rovements in other glycemic markers at month three compared to 
BGM in people with T2D who participate in the Virta Treatment.  
 
15.5    Sample Size Determination  
 
The sample size estimation is based on the following assumptions:  
● 80% power (at 0.05 significance level) to test the primary hypothesis, which is the difference in 
TIR between BGM and CGM arms  
● anticipated mean difference in TIR between CGM and BGM = 10%  
● anticipated standard deviation of TIR in each arm = 20%  
 
The two -sided t -test suggest s N=63 for each arm. Assuming an 85% retention rate at the end of the [ADDRESS_451875] -Dietary Change period brings the required sample size to approximately N=75 per arm; or 
N=[ADDRESS_451876] the 150 total participants; these 
participants may be replaced.  
 
16 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects

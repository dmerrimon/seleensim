1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
Medical care of heart failure (HF) has been stagnant for the past 20 years; innovative 
therapy is urgently needed. A novel therapeutic target, mitochondrial dysfunction, has 
been implicated in multiple diseases, including heart fail ure. However, there currently is no 
specific treatment for mitochondrial dysfunction in human heart failure or any other 
disease. Mitochondria -based therapy development has been hampered both by [CONTACT_798309], and by a lack 
of interventions shown to improve mitochondrial function.  
 
1.2 Study rationale  
Recently, we demonstrated in a murine model, that impaired mitochondrial oxidative 
phosphorylation led to an increased myocardial NADH/NAD+ ratio and increased 
mitochondrial protein acetylation, without affecting mitochondrial ROS production or ATP 
synthesis. These changes rendered the heart susceptible to chronic stresses, which 
accelerated the development of heart failure. We obser ved a similar increase of 
NADH/NAD+ ratio and increase in protein acetylation in animal models of heart failure due 
to chronic pressure overload with no prior mitochondrial dysfunction. Supplying the NAD+ 
precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), to th ese mice normalized the 
NADH/NAD+ ratio, prevented increased mitochondrial protein acetylation and improved 
cardiac function. Though NMN is not orally bioavailable, we and others have shown that 
oral supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (NR), the pre cursor from which NMN is 
produced, also decreases (normalizes) tissue NADH/NAD+ ratio and improves 
mitochondrial function in mouse models. These animal model results suggest a 
conceptually innovative mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction to the devel opment 
and progression of heart failure that is distinct from the existing hypotheses of oxidative 
stress and energy starvation. Thus, we hypothesize that oral supplementation with NR will 
increase NAD+ levels, thereby [CONTACT_798310]/NAD+ ratio cause d by [CONTACT_798311], and improve functional capacity and ventricular 
function in systolic heart failure.  
We therefore propose a safety and tolerability trial of the nutritional supplement, 
nicotinamide riboside (NR) in [ADDRESS_1101095] on lipid levels. NR does n ot induce insulin 
resistance or dysglycemia in mouse models. Thus, NR would potentially be cheap, safe, 
well-tolerated and readily available. The application is in response to the program 
announcement of “Nutrition and Diet in the Causation, Prevention, an d Management of 
Heart Failure” as NR has recently been approved for human use as a health supplement.  
 
2. Study Objectives  
The Study has three objectives : 1) to determine the safety and tolerability of NR in patients 
with clinically -stable, systolic heart fa ilure (LVEF <40%); 2) to determine whether, at the 
doses employed, NR has measureable effects on whole blood  NAD+ level s; and 3) to 
explore the potential range of effects of NR supplementation on heart failure surrogate 
endpoints.

Clinical Study Protocol  
[ADDRESS_1101096] taking this supplement. We will 
monitor for skin rash, increased blood sugar, or cause mildly abnormal hepatic function.  In 
diabetic participants, it is possible that nicotinamide riboside may worsen glucose 
intolerance and necessitate an adjustment  in medications  for treatment of diabetes. We 
also will monitor for worsening in signs and symptoms of heart failure, by [CONTACT_798313], dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, 
arrhythmia/palpi[INVESTIGATOR_511177]. We w ill monitor blood levels of B -type natriuretic peptide 
(BNP), serum electrolytes, BUN and creatinine at Study visits 1, 3, 4, 7 and visit 6 
according to the PI’s judgement .

assessments include:  
 
o Record of concomitant medications or interventions, if any  
o Record of adverse events, if any  
 
7. Sources of Materials  
Data will be collected throughout the study from participants on their health status and 
concomitant medications. Clinical, demographic and laboratory values collected as a part 
of the Study will be stored in a multidimensional database at the UW Clinical 
Atherosclerosis Research Laboratory (CARL). All lab samples are identified by a study 
number only. The two echocardiograms will be recorded on MOD disks during the study. 
Individu ally identifiable data is recorded in individual study charts for each participant, and 
in a password -protected study database. Individually identifiable data will be accessible 
only to the study investigators.  
 
8. Potential Risks  
Participants may experience discomfort and bruising from blood draws. Rarely, an 
infection could develop.  
There are no known hazards to exposure of ultrasound waves, however some participants 
may experience discomfort at lying still.  
This is a study of a nutritional supp lement. For those participants taking nicotinamide 
riboside, a warm flushing sensation may occur when first taking this supplement. We will 
monitor for skin rash, increased blood sugar, or cause mildly abnormal hepatic function. In 
diabetic participants, i t is possible that nicotinamide riboside may worsen glucose 
intolerance and necessitate an adjustment in medications for treatment of diabetes. We 
also will monitor for worsening in signs and symptoms of heart failure, by [CONTACT_798313],  dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, 
arrhythmia/palpi[INVESTIGATOR_511177].  
 
9. Adequate Protection Against Risk  
Recruitment and Informed Consent.  Recruitment for this proposed study will be conducted 
according to the IRB policies at the University of Washington, as well as HIPAA policies. 
Clinical Study Protocol  
[ADDRESS_1101100] will we continue study recruitment.  
To the participants who are interested in the study, study staff will explain the study’s 
purpose and design and what would be required of participants. A series of questions will 
be asked to make sure the participant meets eligibility requirements. Then, the informed 
consent will be conducted by [CONTACT_424055] a study coordinator. Participants wil l be 
encouraged to ask questions and to share the information with their regular doctor. A copy 
of this consent will be given to the participants; the original will be placed in the 
participant’s study chart.  
 
Protection Against Risks . All access to indiv idually identified participant data is limited to 
the investigators who are directly involved in this research study, the clinical research staff 
of the Translational Research Unit during the subjects’ visits, and the UWMC Research 
Testing Service. Study c harts and password -protected databases are confidential and are 
not released to outside parties except at the participant’s request. All blood samples for 
laboratory analysis outside UWMC are ONLY identified by a study number. The Study 
charts containing p aper forms will be stored in the locked file cabinets in the research 
clinics or offices where they only can be accessed by [CONTACT_473]. Each participant 
will receive a unique study number. The study number is linked to the participant’s 
personally -Identifiable information in the study database and used to perform data entry 
and linking.  
 
Notification of Participants and Their Physicians.  Study participants and their primary care 
or vascular care physicians will be notified if there is clinical worsening of their heart 
failure. We will leave the further clinical follow -up and treatment plans to be made by [CONTACT_32346]’ physicians. Parti cipants will not be notified of the results of other laboratory 
studies performed specifically for this Study.  
 
10. Potential Benefits of Research to the Participant and Others  
Individual participants may benefit from this study by [CONTACT_511191] a nutritional suppl ement 
that has shown some promise in animal models of heart failure.  
 
11. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
If the Study can demonstrate that nicotinamide riboside is safe and well -tolerated in 
participants with systolic heart failure, this will form t he basis of a follow -on study to assess 
the efficacy of nicotinamide ribose on surrogate endpoints in heart failure, such as 
functional capacity and ejection fraction. Thus, the Study may provide information 
necessary to further explore the clinical utilit y of this nutritional supplement in the 
treatment of systolic heart failure, a large and growing population of high risk participants 
for whom treatment, at present, is less than adequate.  
 
12. Data Safety Monitoring Board  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be instituted for this Study in order to ensure 
its ongoing safety and to oversee the Interim Analyses. Recommendation for trial 
continuation will be guided by [CONTACT_798316]. 
Safety review meetings will be held by [CONTACT_798317], at which time the 
DSMB will develop any formal “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877](s)” for the Study. The DSMB will meet three 
Clinical Study Protocol  
29 January 2018  Version 1.4  Page 12 of 12 
 
additional t imes: after completion of 10, 20 and 30 Study participants. Safety data will 
include pre -specified evaluation of parameters for blood glucose, myopathy, 
hepatotoxicity, renal function as well as signs/symptoms of heart failure, or other possible 
clinical s ide effects such as gout, as requested by [CONTACT_4318]. Enrollment to the study will 
continue throughout the scheduled meetings of the DSMB. The three -member, Study

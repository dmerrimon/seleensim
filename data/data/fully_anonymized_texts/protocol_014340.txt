A. Study Design or Approach  
Overview of the study design:  
We propose to test the effectiveness of mentoring 
by [CONTACT_88109]’ QOL, caregiver 
burden and patient engagement. We will randomize 
CKD patients and caregivers into 3 groups: 1) face -
to-face peer -mentoring; 2) online peer -mentoring; 
3) information -only control. We will use the Patient 
and Family Partner Program (PFPP) , described 
above , as the mentoring program for the 
intervention groups. Patients with CKD and their 
caregivers assigned  to the face -to-face intervention 
groups will receive 6 months of peer -led mentoring 
through the face -to-face PFPP. Participants 
assigned to the online intervention group will also 
receive 6 -months of peer -led mentoring through the 
online version of the PF PP. The information -only 
group will receive the informational textbook of the 
PFPP to review independently. At baseline, 12 
months, and 18 months, the patients will complete 
QOL surveys  and the Patient Activation Measure; 
the caregivers will complete the Z arit Burden 
Inventory. The proposed study design is shown in 
figure 3.   
Figure 3. Proposed Study Design  
 
Research Question:  Will a peer -led mentoring program (Patient and Family Partner Program: PFPP) lead 
to improvement in HR QOL among patients with CKD and caregivers of patients with CKD?  
 
Comparators:  We will conduct a randomized controlled trial among CKD patients and their caregivers. The 
comparators are: 1) face-to-face PFPP; 2) online PFPP; 3) information -only control. T he choice of comparators 
emerged following a review of mentor and mentee  evaluations and a  focus group discussion involving patient s, 
renal social workers, director of the KFCP, PFPP program coordinator, and the PFPP medical director (PI). We 
have included  an online intervention as a comparator based on evidence that Web-based peer -support is a 
potential alternative, particularly for populations with limited ability to travel, and for regions with limited 
resources. Such programs have enhanced the care of d iabetes  [65, 66]. Zrebiec evaluated a  web-based 
educational and emotional resource for patients with diabete s and their family members at Joslin Diabetes 
Center. Over 74 months, a total of 74% of all respondents rated participation in the discussion board as having 
a positive effect on copi[INVESTIGATOR_88093], and 71% rated participation as helpi[INVESTIGATOR_88094] e hopeful [67]. 
Improvements in the online group were similar to those achieved in the face -to-face groups [68]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_88095], high -quality evidence is lacking 
about the effect of information or support interventions on the psychosocial well -being of caregivers [69].To 
further investigate this, we have included caregiver burden as an outcome measure.  
 
Participant recruitment, randomization and retention:  Participants will include caregivers and  patients.  A 
significant number  of the renal professionals, particularly renal social workers within the area served by [CONTACT_88110], 
are familiar with the PFPP. The P rogram C oordinator (PC)  will contact [CONTACT_88111] a quarter ly basis to provide them with information about the program. For the purpose of this study, 
the PC will travel to all of the dialysis units  and will provide information about PFPP , as well as  recruitment 
flyers to be distributed among patients  and their ca regivers . The flyers will provide brief information about 
PFPP and will ask patients who might be interested in exploring being matched with a certified partner ( CP) to 
contact [CONTACT_88112]. The social worker will s creen the volunteers and Invitation flyers targeting stage 4 or 5 CKD patients  
(or caregivers)  sent to nephrology practices and 
dialysis units in c entral P ennsylvania

 2 will refer candidates who meet the inclusion criteria to the PC. PFPP does not allow patients or caregivers to 
self-refer.   
Recruitment , randomization and retention . Mentees  will be recruited from among patients with CKD stage 4 
or 5, or caregivers of patients with CKD, 18 years or older, willing to participate. With assistance from renal 
professionals  and the KFCP, w e will recruit 132 patients with CKD and 84 caregivers , for a total sample of 216 
potential mentee s (please see sampl e size determination below). Recruitment for the purpose of this proposed 
study will occur continuously until the target sample size is achieved. The principal contact  [CONTACT_88113]. Information packets about the program  are sent to dialysis units and 
nephrologist practices asking renal professionals to distribute them amon g patients . The packets include 
introduction t o the program, and an application form. Prior to enrollment, the PC or the executive director of the 
KFCP  interviews each applicant. Inclusion criteria: 1) at least 18 years of age; 2) diagnosed with stage 4 or 5 
CKD by a physician  or caregiver to a CKD patient ; 3) not participated in previous peer -mentoring for CKD; 4) 
access to computer with internet and em ail capability. Following informed consent, mentee  candidates will 
undergo permuted block randomization with 1:1:1 allocation into “face -to-face PFPP”,  “online PFPP”, and 
“information -only control”. To improve retention, we will  compensate participants wit h $50 stipend for the 
baseline assessment and each of the follow -up assessments for a total of $150 per participant  
 
Baseline Assessment.  Following randomization, the participants will complete the baseline assessments 
which include demog raphic data and co mpletion of the appropriate survey instrument. Patients will complete 
the QOL and patient activation instrument; caregivers will complete the burden inventory.  
 
The interventions  
The partnership:  Once a candidate  is referred, the PC collaborates with the referring professional to identify the 
most appropriate match, taking into consideration age, gender, treatment modality and preference for online or 
face-to-face mentoring. All participants  will receive the PFPP textbook . Partnerships ar e maintained for 6  
months.   
 For the face -to-face partnership , the frequency of contact [CONTACT_3265] a CP is weekly by [CONTACT_88114]-to-
face visit. The mentees have the choice of meeting their CP at a location preferred by [CONTACT_476]. If the pair 
decides on a lunch meeting, reimbur sement is provided  by [CONTACT_88115].  
 For the online partnership , the frequency of contact [CONTACT_88116], and more frequently as initiated by [CONTACT_88117]. The coordinator maintains regular contact [CONTACT_88118]. Each CP submits, to the coordinator, a 
confidential report of the communications with the respective mentee, highlighting points of discussion, 
mentee concerns and plan for next contact.  The coordinator also  maintains close communication with the 
mentee’s care group, particularly the social worker.  
Information -only control:   The control group will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_88096], the outline of which is presented in tab le 1. The text targets 8th grade reading level.  
 
Content of o nline peer -mentoring:  We will develop the contents of the online mentoring program, according to 
themes that emerge from qualitative interviews and discussions with experienced peer mentors, pati ents, 
caregivers and healthcare professionals. We will administer an online version of the face -to-face PFPP via a 
secure internet site. The Online PFPP will consist of password -protected, interactive web -based instruction, 
web-based bulletin board discuss ion thread with the peer mentor . All communications between mentors and 
participants will be online. Following initial introductions, the trained mentor will initiate the discussion thread by 
[CONTACT_88119]. The mentor and the partic ipant will also review mutual goals and 
expectations at time of initial communication. The mentor will encourage the participant to become familiar with 
the textbook and to post any questions or concerns they might have.  The mentor will send a weekly remi nder 
email to each participant to log on to the website to review posted contents and to post a weekly action plan, 
as well as any problems they wish to discuss with their mentor. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_88097].    
 
Follow -up Assessments.

PCORI Research Plan – PFAs 1 -4                                                                                                                                                 
 3  12 month and 18 month follow -up assessments will include demographic data and completion of the 
appropriate survey instrument. Patients will co mplete the QOL and patient activation instrument; caregivers 
will complete the burden inventory.  
 
Variables: The independent variable  will be group allocation to the face-to-face PFPP, online PFPP or 
information -only control group. Analyses will be intent -to-treat.  Covariates  will include demographic measures 
(age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, highest grade completed, primary language spoken at home, 
employment status, household income, rural vs. urban location, and mode of ESRD treatment ).  
Primary outcome variable 1 (Aim #1): Improvement in HRQOL  
The primary outcome  for specific aim 1  is health related QOL  (HRQOL). At each assessment, the patients will 
complete  the short form Kidney Disease QOL instrument from the Rand Corporation (KDQOL -SF) [72]. This 
instrument was developed as a self -report, health -related QOL tool designed specifically for patients with CKD 
[72]. The original 134 -item instrument was later condensed into the 80 -item Kidney Disease Quality of Life 
Instrument -Short Form (KDQOL -SF)[73]. The questionnaire consists of the generic SF -36 [74] as well as 11 
multi -item scales focused on kidney -specific QOL  domains. The subscales are scored on a 0 to 100 scale, 
higher numbers indicating better HRQOL. The Kidney Disease Component Summary (KDCS) is an average of 
the 11 kidney -specific subscales. This tool has been validat ed among patients with CKD with predictive value 
for several outcomes including survival  [75-77]. The instrument adds a kidney disease component (44 items) to 
the SF -[ADDRESS_96112] widely used and validated measure of HRQOL in the nephrology 
literature  [76, 78-83]. 
Primary outcome  variable 2 (Aim #2): Decrease in Caregiver Burden  
The primary outcome for specific aim 2 is caregivers  burden . Caregiver burden  will be assessed by [CONTACT_88120] ( ZBI), a self -administered questionnaire of [ADDRESS_96113]  of 
caregiving in psychological, physical and social domains. The items are ranked on a five -point Likert scale [84], 
and a total score is calculated from 0 to 88; the higher the scor e the heavier the burden [85]. ZBI has been 
used to measure caregiver burden among caregivers of dialysis patients [86]. 
Secondary  outcome  (Aim #3): Improvement in patient engagement  
The secondary outcome  is improvement in patient engagement. At each assessment, the patients will 
complete the Patient Activation Measure  (PAM) . Initially developed as a [ADDRESS_96114] similar validi ty to the original version [87, 88]. The instrument is a 
participant -completed questionnaire which yields a continuous activation score ranging from 0 to 100,  
representing patients' positions along a multistage, hierarchical process of activation. PAM is a well -validated 
tool for assessing patient engagement and its impact on outcomes among individuals with vari ous chronic 
diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease [89], and multiple sclerosis [90]. It has also been validated as a 
measure of patient  activation and adherence to physical therapy  for individuals undergoing elective spi[INVESTIGATOR_88098] [91]. The high reliability estimate of PAM (Cronbach′s 
alpha
 =
0.91) maintains precision across gender and age groups [92], and geographic locations [88, 93, 94]. 
Higher PAM scores are associated with better self -management health behaviors such as adherence to 
medication adherence and other health behaviors,  higher satisfaction, QOL , and physical and mental 
functioning  [92, 95, 96].  
Quantitative a nalytical methods .The outcome variables are continuous and will be measured at three time 
points (baseline, 12 months and 18 months). Descriptive statistics will be computed for all variables. Repeated 
measures anal ysis of variance (ANOVA) within the context of a linear mixed -effects model will be applied to 
estimate time -related changes in QOL. If overall differences are found via this model, then pair -wise 
comparisons of group means will be conducted using approxim ate t-tests from the model estimates. SAS, 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) will be used for data analysis.  
Avoidance of bias: To avoid bias in group allocation, a strict randomization procedure will be followed. We will 
test for even distributi on of potentially confounding variables between the three groups. In the event of uneven 
distribution of confounding variables, we will control for those variables in the final analyses.  
Sample size for patients

 4 comparison of three means, a sample size of 39 per group will yield a statistical power of 0.8. Assuming 
dropout rate of 1 5%[68], a total of  132 patients will be recruited (44  for each of the three study groups) . 
 
Sample size for car egivers  
The primary outcome for specific aim 2 is improvement in the Zarit Burden Inventory . The number of subjects 
needed is computed using data from a study assessing burden among caregivers of PD patients, in which t he 
mean combined caregiver burden sco re was 12.5 ± 8.7  [86]. Assuming an effect size of one SD, an alpha of 
0.05, comparison of three means, a sample size of 23 will yield a statistical power of 0.8.  We will recr uit a total 
of 84 caregivers (28  for each of the three study groups) to adjust for a dropout rate of 15%.  
 
Potential limitations and strategies to minimize their impact : 
1. Success of the program will depend on cooperation between renal professionals and the PFPP. Renal 
professionals may not consider the PFPP as a reliable resource. They might be concerned that the 
program will interfere with the patient -provider relationship. They will be reassured that the mentors are 
trained to avoid providing medical advice. A requirement of participation of mentors and mentees is referral 
by [CONTACT_88121]. This establishes a collaborative bond between the professionals and the 
program. In addition, instructors recruited from various practices are likely to serve as advocates of the 
program.  
2. Renal professionals might be concerned that t rained mentors from different practices m ay try to attract 
mentees to their personal medical teams.  To address this concern, PFPP is currently conducted as an 
intra-practice program; trained mentors are assigned only to patients and caregivers from the same 
medical practice. Exceptions will be ma de only with prior approval of the mentee’s medical team.   
3. Some social workers may view PFPP as additional work. They will be reassured that the PFPP will do 
much of the work involved in the training, providing informational and educational material and in terviewing 
recruits. Social workers who have actively participated in the past have noted that they are pleased that the 
PFPP has helped their patients become more actively engaged. Social workers who serve as members of 
the curriculum committee, Advisory Board and as instructors will serve as ambassadors to their colleagues 
in various practices.  
4. The study is limited to subjects with computer literacy and those with Internet access. On the other hand, 
this strategy allows for involvement of participants wh o cannot benefit from face -to-face mentoring due to 
distance and travel considerations. Furthermore, with increasing accessibility of computers and the 
Internet, web -based mentoring is expected to be available to a larger population.  
B. Project Milestones  
This Milestone Schedule ass umes a start date of 08/01/2014.   
Year 1: During the first [ADDRESS_96116] two meetings. 
Preliminary results of the interventions will be presented to the scientific community  and the stakeholders.   
Year 2: During the second  12-month period , mentee  recruitment, randomization and all baseline assessments 
and interventions will be completed . The Patient and Caregiver Advisory Group will meet twice, the Provider 
Advisory Group once and the Community Advisory Board q uarterly during Year 2.  Results of the interventions 
will be presented to the scientific community and the stakeholders.   
Year 3: During t he third [ADDRESS_96117].   
 
C. Patient Population  
The study population will be derived from dialysis units and nephrology practices in central Pennsylvania. 
Eligibl e participants will be female or male participants 18 years or older who are either patients diagnosed with 
CKD stage 4 or 5, or caregivers to patients with CKD 4 or 5. CKD is a prevalent condition that affects men and 
women of all ages, and all race/ethni c and socio -demographic categories. The recruitment area is wide and 
includes 28 counties, including urban and rural areas, all race/ethnic categories, and all socioeconomic levels.

PCORI Research Plan – PFAs [ADDRESS_96118] been involved in all phases of the 
development of the proposed research. The Patient and Family Partner Program was initially envisione d and 
designed by a patient with CKD; it has been subsequently refined according to periodic qualitative review by 
[CONTACT_88122]. The success of the Program has depended on the commitment of patients and 
caregivers as Certified Partners. Patients  have actively participated in the development of this proposal. A 
Patient and Caregiver Advisory Group of 12 members (minimum of 5 patients; minimum of 5 caregivers) will be 
convened to provide the patients’ and caregivers’ perspectives regarding the cont ent of the interventions, 
strategies for recruitment of participants, interpretation and dissemination of findings.  
Provider Advisory Group   Providers have played an important role in the development of this proposal and are 
key stakeholders in the succe ss of the proposal. We will invite nephrologists, primary care providers, transplant 
professionals, renal social workers, dialysis nurses and transplant coordinators to participate in a [ADDRESS_96119] one member will be selected 
from each of the disciplines). The Provider Advisory Group will meet with the Research Team before 
participant recruitment and during the fourth quarter of each year to contribute the providers’ perspective on 
the interpretation and dissemination of  findings . 
Board of Directors of the KFCP  A 15-member volunteer Board of Directors of the KFCP guides the activities of 
the PFPP and has provided insight in the development of the proposed research. The membership of the 
Board of Directors includes patients, caregivers, nephrologists, a transplant surgeon, a senior medical director 
of a major healthcare network (Highmark) and primary care physician, dialysis social workers, members of the 
community, and an attorney.  Some of the members of the Board have been trained as Certified Partners. For 
the purpose of this project, the Board of Directors will function as the Community Advisory Board. [CONTACT_88128] (PI) is a member of the Board of Directors and will present upd ates on the project at the quarterly 
meetings to seek input regarding recruitment, conduct of the study, interpretation and dissemination of 
findings.  
Consultant  XXXX , MSW  is an experienced renal social worker  and one of the original founders of the PFPP. 
She has had active involvement in the development of the proposed research. As a consultant, she will assist 
in the development of the content of the online intervention. She is well -known to the renal social work 
community of central Pennsylvania and will  also assist in the description of the PFPP to potential participants 
and healthcare providers, in order to enhance recruitment.  She will provide 50 hours of consultation per year 
for the 3 year period of the study.

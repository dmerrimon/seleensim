The goal of this randomized, placebo controlled, pha se II/III trial is to evaluate 
isoquercetin  as a novel anticoagulant in patients  with advanced cancer (pancreatic, non -
small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer). The primary goal of the phase II study is 
to assess the relative reduction  in D- dimer levels following isoquercetin administration  
and evaluate safety . Based on efficacy and safety  data, a dose of iso quercetin will be 
selected for conti nued enrollment into a phase III trial  in order to evaluate t he 
effectiveness of isoquercetin in preventing VTE in cancer  patients.   
 
1.2 Primary Objectives  
 
•      The phase II primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of isoquercetin to reduce D -
dimer values  
•      The phase III primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of oral isoquercetin  to 
prevent venous thromboembolic events in cancer patients   
 
1.3 Secondary Objectives  
 
•     To investigate the cumulative incidence of VTE accord ing to tissue factor bearing 
microparticle status (and isoquercetin  randomization).To evaluate the cumulative 
incidence of major hemorrhage  between the groups of patients treated with isoquercetin  
versus placebo .  
•     To assess o verall survival according t o randomization and tissue factor bearing 
microparticle status   
•     To investigate the c umulative i ncidence of total or symptomatic VTE in all treatment 
arms (and according to tissue factor bearing microparticle status)  
•     To study the influen ce of isoque rcetin  on TFMP levels and change in TFMP levels over 
time.  
•     To evaluate the cumulative incidence of VTE in patients with elevated TFMP as well as 
very elevated d -dimer (>1500 mcg/L) overall and according to randomization.  
•     To assess for c orrelation  between complete blood co unt, ECOG, histology, stage, D-
dimer, and levels of tissue factor bearing microparticles   
•  To investigate the influence of chemotherapy, blood counts, growth factors, ECOG 
performance status on tissue factor bearing microparticle levels as well as  VTE risk.  
•     Influence of VTE and isoquercetin  on Quality of Life (QOL)  
•     To investigate the association between isoquercetin plasma concentrations, inhibition of 
protein disulfide isomerase activity, and reduction in D- dimer.  
•     To e valuate the efficacy of isoquercetin to reduce D- dimer or VTE in cancer patients 
based on levels of circulating tissue factor bearing microparticles or Khorana risk model  
•    To compare VTE rates at completion of phase II with historical rates of VTE in sim ilar 
population

2 2 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Agent(s)  - Isoquercetin  
 
Isoquercetin  is naturally occurring flavonol present in a number of fruits and vegetables such 
as berries, apples, and onions. Isoquercetin is the 3-0 glucoside form of the flavonol quercetin 
whic h is designated as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by [CONTACT_33438].[ADDRESS_807623] demonstrated potent antithrombotic activities of 
quercetin and related flavonoids in vitro and in animal models through inhibition of extracellular  protein disulfide isomerase (PDI).
2 The goal of this trial is to evaluate the 
anticoagulant and antithrombotic activity of isoquercetin in patients with advanced malignancy.  
 
Mechanism of action:  
Extracellular disulfide isomerization has been explo red as a regulatory pathway in platelet 
activation and fibrin generation. P rotein disulfide isomerase  is a thiol isomerase that is secreted 
by [CONTACT_609075].3-[ADDRESS_807624] PDI block platelet thrombus and fibrin generation in vivo, a high throughput screen identified several related flavonoids 
(quercetin -3-rutinoside and isoquercetin) as potent inhibitors of PDI.
2 The Kd of quercet in-3-
rutinoside for PDI in vitro is 2.8 µ M as determined by [CONTACT_386540] (SPR). PDI 
inhibition appears to be specific without evidence of significant inhibition of other thiol isomerases such as ERp57, ERp5, ERp72, or thioredoxin.   We recently conducted a pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic study  to assess  the PDI -
inhibitory activity of isoquercetin  in humans. Following an oral dose of isoquercetin (1000 mg  
capsules ), the median peak concentration was 4.45 µM with a half -life of 8.2 hours. PDI 
inhibitory activity of plasma  was measured  using the fluorescent substrate dieosin glutathione 
disulfide (di-E- GSSG) to liberate a self -quenching N- terminal GSSG residue following 
cleavage of a disulfide bond. 
7-9  In all study subjects, we detected significant PDI -inhibitory 
activity in plasma following the oral administration of isoquercetin  1000 mg  capsule.10  
Phase II/III trial of antithrombotic activity of isoquercetin  
October 27, [ADDRESS_807625] garnered attention in the 1990's followin g the 
publication of several large epi[INVESTIGATOR_29820]. In the Zupthen Elderly Study, the group of individuals who consumed over 30 mg of flavonoids daily experienced a nearly 70% reduction in mortality from myocardial infarction (adjusted RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15-0.71) compared with those individuals who consumed less than [ADDRESS_807626] yielded inconsistent 
results. Flavonoids such as isoquercetin  are known to inhibit platelet function in vitro.
16-19 The 
ingestion of either onion soup or quercetin -4’-O- β-D-glucoside (the predominant quercetin 
found in onions) inhibited ex vivo platelet aggregation.20,21 Howe ver there has never been a 
late stage clinical study on the use of isoquercetin  to specifically prevent thrombotic events in 
humans.

Selection of dose: 
The inhibitory IC50 of PDI activity in vitro for isoquercetin  metabolites r anges between 3 -
10uM.2 Following the oral administration of isoquercetin (1000 mg) in healthy volunteers, t he 
peak concentration of iso quercetin  metabolites in healthy volunteers was  4.45µM and  was 
associated with 67% inhibition of PDI  activity in plasma at [ADDRESS_807627] not demonstrated 
toxicity. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_609050] 16 patients with mild cognitive impairment, isoquercetin 
350 mg and ascorbic acid 400 mg taken for 6 months demonstrated a positive trend in cognitive function without any reported side effects (Investigators Brochure). In another study designed to evaluate the effect of isoquercetin and quercetin , thirteen individuals took 
isoquercetin 400 mg isoquercetin in conjunction with quercetin 1000 mg daily for two weeks without toxicity.
22  Based on in vitro, animal, and human data as well as safety profile of 
isoquercetin  (and parent compound quercetin), the planned sequential dosing cohorts for the 
clinical phase II trial are 500mg  and1000 mg once daily.   
 
Absorption, Metabolism,  and Bioavailability  
A number of clinical studies have investigated  the metabolic fate of  quercetin and its 
glucosides. I soquercetin is better absorbed than quercetin aglycone, possibly due to increased 
stability at low  pH.23 The pharmacokinetic study we conducted in healthy adults (isoquercetin 
1000 mg  capsules ) AUC was [ADDRESS_807628] demonstrated 
biologic activity 2,29,30.  
 
Distribution  
 
Isoquercetin  and its metabolites  possess high affinity for serum albumin.31 Quercetin 
metabolites did not accumulate in tissue following four weeks of daily administration to pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. Only the organs involved in metabolism and excretion such as the small intestine, liver, and 
kidney, contained higher concentrations than plasma
32. The elimination of absorbed quercetin 
follows a biphasic profile, likely due to enterohepatic recirculation following elimination of quercetin metabolites in bile.
31,33  
 
Excretion  
 Following metabolism in the liver and/or degradation in the intestine, quercetin is excreted  as exhaled CO
2 with  smaller amounts found in feces and urine.25,34

5 The prothrombotic state associated with malignant disease has been a recognized entity since 
the 1800’s. Almost 1 in 5 cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) are thought to be related to cancer, and thrombosis is the second leading cause of mortality in cancer populations.
[ADDRESS_807629] demonstrated a small absolute risk reduction in VTE with primary thromboprophylaxis of low molecular weight heparins. The absolute risk of VTE in these unselected cohorts is low (3-5%) and thus the benefit of daily injection and potential risk for bleeding has tempered enthusiasm for non- targeted thromboprophylaxis approaches .  Different models and 
biomarkers are under investigation to identify those patients who are highest risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_609051]. Khorana and colleagues developed and validated a scoring model that identified higher risk patients based on elevated platelet count, white blood cell count, body- mass index, and anemia.
37  
Pathologic changes in microparticle populations contribute to the hypercoagulability associated with various disease states, including malignancy. Microparticles are  vesicular 
structures measuring less than 1 µm in size and are derived from a number of cells within the 
vascular compartment including leukocytes, platelets, red blood cells, and endothelial cells.
38 
Some microparticles are considered procoagulant due to the exposure of negatively charged 
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_609052].39,40 
Subpopulations of microparticles also express tissue factor, the in vivo initiator of blood coagulation.
41,42 Circulating tissue factor -bearing microparticles augment thrombus formation 
in animal models43 and tumor- derived microparticles accumulate at the site of vascular 
injury.44 Our group pr eviously demonstrated that tissue factor bearing microparticles are 
elevated in cancer patients diagnosed with VTE and appear to be derived from the underlying tumor.
45 The association between tissue factor bearing microparticles and VTE has been 
described by s everal groups as well, including in a mouse model of vascular injury.44,46 
Notably, in our study the 1 year cumulative incidence of thrombosis in cancer patients with increased tissue factor bearing microparticles was 34.8% versus 0% in those without detectable tissue factor bearing microparticles.
45 We recently completed a randomized phase II trial of 
low molecular we ight heparin to prevent thrombosis in cancer patients with elevated tissue 
factor bearing microparticles.47 The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of VTE at 
60 days, as defined by [CONTACT_609076]- mandated bilateral lower extremity ultrasound. The overall cumulative incidence of 
thrombosis across the study was 11.3% at 60 days. The cumulative incidence of thrombosis in the high tissue factor bearing microparticle patients was  27% (N=11) compared with 5% 
(N=23) in those treated with low molecular weight heparin (P=0.06).

daily injection . We previously observed a cumulative incidence of VTE of 11.3% at 60 days in 
patients with advanced non- small lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer .

October 27, [ADDRESS_807631] been described in humans and we observed that 
the oral administration of isoquercetin  results in PDI -inhibitory activity  in hum an plasma.  
Fortuitously, isoquercetin  is widely available flavonoid nutritional supplement.  Based on the 
safety profile and evident antithrombotic properties of isoquercetin, we aim to evaluate isoquercetin  as an anticoagulant in cancer patients in a comb ined phase II/ III clinical trial.

evaluation of the Phase II portion of the trial.  The protocol will be amended when the decision is made whether to proceed to Phase III and what dose to use for Arm C .  The study will be 
double -blinded to treatment arm. Lower  extremity ultraso und will be performed at end of 
treatment . Baseline D -dimer and correlative labs  will be drawn at Day [ADDRESS_807640] dose of study drug. Non-collection of the optional blood draw  will be permitted if patients 
ultimately decide not to stay for the 4 hour collection.   
 NOTE: all capsules also have ascorbic acid and niacin  to improve stability and bioavailability 
of isoquercetin.

14 Intravenous administration of quercetin can be associated with nephrotoxicity.  Doses up to 
11.4 mg/kg body weight (equivalent of 694 mg in a 60 kg patient) were associated with 
transient flushing and mild pain at the injection site54. At the higher dose levels of up to 54.1 
mg/kg body weight (equivalent to 10,000 mg  orally), grade 1 -4 nephrotoxicity was described, 
as well as dyspnea and emesis.   
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_609054], hemorrhage has not been described as  a toxicity in clinical studies.  
 The supplied capsules contain ascorbic acid (62 mg) and niacin (5 mg) to prevent oxidation 
and improve absorption of isoquercetin. The recommended daily allowance of niacin is between 14 and 16 mg. Higher doses of niacin (between 300 mg and 6000 mg daily ) are 
prescribed for hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_609055]. At physiologic dosing, side effects attributable to niacin would be 
unexpected . Similarly, ascorbi c acid supplementation is not associated with significant 
toxicity.  There are case reports of hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency 
receiving extreme doses (several grams) of ascorbic acid.

8.1 Pharmacodynamic and Correlative Studies  
A total of 10 ml of blood will be drawn into blue top tubes (3.2% citrate) in either two 
5ml tubes or one 15ml tube.  

Phase II/III trial of antithrombotic activity of isoquercetin  
October 27, [ADDRESS_807652] centrifugation should be 
performed within 1 hour of specimen collection.  The plasma layer will be centrifuged 
a second time at 2100 x G x 20 minutes in a single tube. The plasma super natant will be 
transferred to a clean tube leaving the 1ml at the bottom of the tube undisturbed (to be 
discarded). The transferred plasma sample will be aliquoted (500 µl) into 1.5ml 
eppendorf tubes.  
Tubes may be stored locally at -80oC and batch shipped on dry ice to CAT IQ 
Study Team  
  
(BIDMC only) Optional blood draws include an additional 10ml drawn into citrated 
tubes for platelet aggregometry at time 0 and 4 hours. Tubes will be kept at room temperature for analysis in the Flaumenhaft laboratory. (see below)  
Correlative Studies: 
• Tissue factor bearing mi croparticles (TFMP) will be measured by [CONTACT_609087]. A determination of “high” TFMP is based on concentration greater than two-thirds of samples previously collected from patients with advanced cancer (highest tercile of cancer standards). Plasma samples will be stored at -80oC for up to 5 
years following the completion of the study. Additional testing for thrombosis risk factors or laboratory markers of coagulation activation may be performed on these stored samples.  ( See Appendix E for specimen collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_609059])  
• Plasma PDI -inhibitory activity: The plasma PDI -inhibitory activity will be 
measured using a modified DiEGSSG assay.

• D-dimer will be performed in a research laboratory using a commercially 
available ELISA ([COMPANY_002] Diagnostics).  
• Coagulati on substrates of PDI. The physiological basis for anticoagulant 
activity of PDI inhibition continues to be investigated. Proposed mechanisms include  altered activity of coagulation factors or inhibitors  
such as tissue factor or antithrombin . The functional  activity  of proposed 
coagulation substrates  will be assessed on stored plasma (pending 
additional funding) .  
• Platelet aggregometry (BIDMC only) will be performed by [CONTACT_609088] 4 hours after study drug administration.

10.1    Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)  
 
Cumulative incidence of venous thromboembolic events at 56 days (+/- 7 day windows)  is 
the primary endpoint. The co mposite endpoint includes any symptomatic proximal or 
distal lower extremity DVT, symptomatic pulmonary embolism or fatal PE diagnosed by 
[CONTACT_189152], asymptomatic proximal DVT diagnosed by [CONTACT_609091] . 
All other venous or arterial events will be recorded and analyzed as secondary endpoints. 
 Patients presenting with symptoms compatible with DVT and/or PE will undergo radiographic imaging with either compression ultrasound, VQ lung scan, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_15143]. Confirmed epi[INVESTIGATOR_609060].  
 
Presence of any of the following will be considered diagnostic for a VTE:  
• New non -compressibility of lower extremity deep venous segments by [CONTACT_609092]. Distal lower extremity thrombus (lower than popliteal vein) qualifies for primary VTE endpoint only if symptomatic. All proximal thrombi qualify as primary study endpoint if identified by [CONTACT_609093].  
• Intraluminal defects in two or more views on pulmonary angiography 
• Sudden contrast cut-off of one or more vessels greater than 2.5 mm in diameter on a 
pulmonary angiogram  
• A high probability VQ lung scan showing one or more segmental perfusion defects with correspondin g normal ventilation (mismatch defect)  
• Abnormal spi[INVESTIGATOR_609061] (subsegmental or larger)  
Note: intrabdominal thrombus related to tumor compression is not considered a VTE 
endpoint  
Other VTE  
Those VTE that do not qualify for the primary endpoint such as asymptomatic distal extremity deep vein thrombosis, asymptomatic pulmonary emboli diagnosed by [CONTACT_4654], central line-associated thrombus will be recorded and analysed  as 
secondary endpoints.  
Response Review  
An independent adjudic ation of VTE qualifying for the primary outcome will be 
performed. The review committee will be comprised of two independent hematologists and a radiologist. The committee will review the medical records and radiology report for all VTE that qualify for th e primary VTE endpoint. In cases where committee feels that 
the radiology reports or medical records are equivocal then the primary radiology images will be reviewed by [CONTACT_609094].

• Fatal bleeding,  and/or 
• Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ such as intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra -articular or pericardial, or intramuscular with 
compartment syndrome, and/or 
• Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level >2 g/L or 
• Bleeding leading to a transfusion of > 2 units of packed red blood cells.   
10.3    D-dimer  
 
D-dimer will be measured at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  at baseline and end of 
treatment . Relative change in D -dimer will be assessed for each arm.  
10.4    TFMP levels and thrombotic risk  
Absolute TFMP levels will be measured at baseline and 56 days. A correlation between 
TFMP and thrombotic risk will be investigated according to randomization arm  (see Section

11   ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition 
or experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
11.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death  had it occurred in a 
more severe form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at 
least a 24 -hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279340]).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_609062] 11.3.2: 
DF/HCC Reportable AEs.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical 
operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do

potential risk.   
11.1.6  Attribution  
 Attribution is the  relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event 
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
11.2 Procedures for AE and SAE Recording and Reporting  
 
Phase II/III trial of antithrombotic activity of isoquercetin  
October 27, [ADDRESS_807659] or other means, will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the appropriate study- specific

12.2 Safety Meetings  
 
During the phase II portion of the study, the DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity and accrual data from this study. The committee is composed of clinical s pecialists with experience in oncology and who have 
no direct relationship with the study. Information that raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  
 
The DSMC will review each protocol up to four times a year or more often if required to 
review toxicity and accrual data. Information to be provided to the committee may include: 
up-to-date participant accrual; current dose level information; DLT information; all grade 
[ADDRESS_807672] been reported; summary of all deaths occurring with 30 days of intervention for Phase I or II protocols; for gene therapy protocols, summary of all deaths while being treated and during active follow -up; any 
response information; audit results, and a summary provided by [CONTACT_3476]. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be provided upon request.  
 The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review and monitor study progress, toxicity, safety and other data from this trial during  the Phase III portion of the 
study . The board is chaired by a medical oncologist from outside of DF/HCC and has 
external and internal representation. Information that raises any questions about participant safety or protocol performance w ill be addressed with the Principal 
Investigator, statistician and study team members.  Should any major concerns arise, the DSMB will offer recommendations regarding whether or not to suspend the trial.  
 
The DSMB will meet twice a year to review accrual, toxicity, response and reporting 
information. A DSMB review will also be triggered if the number of toxicity events 
(possible or definite grade 3 or 4 toxici ty or major hemorrhage) prompts  an automatic 
enrollment hold within either cohort  or prior the next  dosing cohort. Information to be 
provided to the DSMB may include: participant accrual, treatment regimen information, adverse events and serious adverse events reported by [CONTACT_17203], summary of any deaths on study, audit results, and a summary provided by  [CONTACT_3476]. Other information 
(e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be provided upon request.

14   STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The aim of this combined phas e II/phase III trial is to evaluate isoquercetin  as an effective 
anticoagulant in cancer patients.  
14.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
14.1.[ADDRESS_807676] validated surrogate marker of 
thrombin ge neration in vivo and symptomatic  VTE .   
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Design: The trial is a sequential cohort study of isoquercetin 500 
mg and 1000 mg daily.         
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomization : Patients will not be randomized.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Accrual : Anticipated accrual is 10 patients per month across all study 
sites.

35 [IP_ADDRESS] Sample Size Justification:   Plasma D-dimer levels typi[INVESTIGATOR_609066] 20% following the initiation of anticoagulation .[ADDRESS_807677] of D-dimer concentrations measured on day 1 and 
end of treatment , to be performed separately for each arm.  In the recently  
completed MicroTEC study, the median  baseline D -dimer concentration 
for all cancer patients enrolled was 815 ug/L.[ADDRESS_807678] deviation of 0.3 for the ratio of the D- dimer levels at day 56 
over the D- dimer levels at day 1 , a total  of 26 subjects are needed per arm 
for a 90% power to declare the reduction significant if the true 
concentration at end of treatment  is reduced by 20% in each iso quercetin 
arm (one -sided alpha 0.05). Estimated death or dropout of 5% prior to 56 
days, the sample size will be increased to a total of total 30 per arm (one-
sided alpha 0.05). With 30 eligible patients per dose level, there is greater than 60% power to d etect an unacceptable attributable grade 3 or 4  rate of 
15% at 56 days using a one- sided 10% level exact binomial test in each 
dose level.  (see table below)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Decision to proceed with enrollment into Cohort B  
A sequential two -stage design will be employed in the Phase II portion of 
this trial, within each dose level, to evaluate the adverse events of major toxicity ( probable or possibly  related grade 3 or 4 adverse events 
including hemorrhage)  at end of treatment for potential early termination 
of the dose i n the case of excessive toxicity. After [ADDRESS_807679] one toxicity with corresponding true rate of 1% and 5% are, respectively, 5% and 23%. With 30 eligible patients the respective probabilities of one or more events are 26% and 79%. The maximum width of a 95% confidence interval on any given toxicity, unadjusted for the two- stage 
design is 36%. Adjusting for the two- stage design, the maximum 95% 
confidence interval width would be 50%. If there are greater than 3  major 
toxicities in the 30 patients in Cohort A, then the cohort will be suspended 
and detailed toxicity data reviewed for possible closure of the study to further accrual  based on DSMC recommendations . If the true but 
unknown toxicity event for major hemorrhages is 5% and 15%, the probability of proceeding to Cohort B after the evaluation of the 30 patients in Cohort A is 92.5% and 30.8%, respectively.  A similar two -
stage design will be employed for patients enrolled in Cohort B. If there are more than [ADDRESS_807680] 5 patients or three or more

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary endpoint analysis : D-dimer concentrations will be compared 
for each patient at  day [ADDRESS_807681] analysis. 
Analysis  will be performed on an intention to treat basis for patients who 
undergo randomization and completed the baseline and end of treatment  
D-dimer assessments .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Determination of continuation w ith phase III trial and selection of 
dose.  Following completion of the phase II study, decision will be made 
by [CONTACT_609095]. The decision to continue will be principally guided by [CONTACT_609096]. 
If both isoquercetin arms me et the primary endpoint then selection of 
dose will be based on degree of  reduction in D- dimer levels in each arm 
relative  to baseline and toxicity profile with special attention to major 
hemorrhage epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. If neither isoquercetin arm results in significant reduction in d- dimer values relative to  baseline, then  consideration to 
advance to phase III will be made based on overall VTE rate in the combined isoquer cetin  arms. D -dimer is  a recognized biomarker of the 
prothrombotic state but is known to lack specificity in cancer cohorts
58. 
Because it is possible that isoquerceti n is an effective antithrombotic 
without altering plasma D -dimer values especially considering po tential 
antiplatelet activity, we will also analyze the cumulative incidence of 
VTE collectively for the isoquercetin  treated patients. A tru e cumulative 
incid ence VTE rate of less than 10 % would be considered promising in 
the combined isoquercetin arms, whereas a true cumulative incidence rate of 25% would not be worthy of further study. Treatment is considered promising among the [ADDRESS_807682] a 92% chance of 
concluding the treatment is effective when the true cumulative incidence

37 rate is 10%, and less than a 5% chance of concluding the treatment is 
effective when the true cum ulativ e incidence rate is 25 % or more  (Fisher 
exact test) . If determination to proceed to phase III is based on promising 
VTE rates, then the higher dose level of isoquercetin will be utilized.  
14.1.2  The primary aim of the phase III trial is determine wh ether isoquercetin reduces the 
cumulative incidence  of symptomatic or proximal VTE in cancer patients at 56 days.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Study design:  The trial is a rand omized, placebo-controlled, double-
blinded phase II I trial.  Study subjects are  randomized to placebo or 
isoquercet in. The  structure of the study matches  the p hase II study, the 
central differences being that VTE is the primary endpoint and a single isoquercetin  arm is compared to  placebo.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomization : Central randomization (1:1) will be performed by 
[CONTACT_609097] a t DF/HCC and stratified by [CONTACT_609098] .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Accrual : Anticipated accrual is 20 patients per month across all sites.     
[IP_ADDRESS] Sample size justification:  
The overall incidence of thrombosis in cancer populations varies between 2-40% based on histology, stage, chemotherapeutics, additional risk factors  and mode of surveillance (imaging or symptomatic events) . The 
overall cumulative incidence of VTE in recently conducted MicroTEC study with similar eligibility criteria and study design was 11.3%.Th e 
estimate of isoquercetin benefit is based on data from primary 
thromboprophylaxis trials that typi[INVESTIGATOR_609069] 4% or less.
60,61 Based on the estimated VTE rates of 11% in the placebo and 4% 
isoquercetin  arms, a total of [ADDRESS_807683] the null hypothesis 
that the failure rates for experimental and control subjects are equal with probability (power) 0.85.  The [ADDRESS_807684] for death or dropout of 5% prior to 56 days, the sample size is increased by [CONTACT_33018] 28 patients. We plan an interim analysis for efficacy or futility after 50% of patients have been randomized that will be guided by O’Brien -Fleming boundaries. This will require an additional increase in 
sample si ze of 5% or [ADDRESS_807685] one dose of study medication. The cumulative incidence of VTE

14.2 Secondary endpoint analysis 
 
•    Cumulative incidence o f VTE in cancer patients with or without tiss ue factor bearing 
microparticles will be assessed for isoquercetin or placebo arms by a competing risk 
analysis and differences evaluated by [CONTACT_609099]. We previously identified elevated 
tissue factor bearing microparticles as a significant risk factor for developi[INVESTIGATOR_609070] a cumulative incidence of 27- 38%.45 We also will evaluate whether 
isoquercetin  reduces the cumulative incidence of symptomatic or proximal VTE in 
cancer patients with elevated tissue factor bearing microparticles. Based on our 
previous data, we anticipate that approximately 45% of patients enrolled will have 
elevated tissue factor bearing microparticles (N=278 ) and half will be randomized to 
placebo or isoquercetin. Based on estimated VTE rates of 20% in the placebo and 7% in the i soquercetin  arms for individuals with high tissue factor bearing microparticles, 
the probability (power) to reject the null hypothesis is 0.84. The 1-sided type I error probability associated with this test of the null hypothesis is 0.025 (Fisher exact tes t).   
•    The cumulative incidence of major hemorrhage between the groups of patients treated 
with isoquercetin  versus those without. Analysis will include time to first major bleed, 
overall incidence of bleeding and analysis of bleeding events over time.  
•    Overall survival according to randomization and tissue factor bearing microparticle 
status  will be analyzed by [CONTACT_609100] -rank analysis  
•    Cumulative incidence of total or symptomatic VTE at 2  months in all treatment ar ms 
(and according to tissue factor bearing microparticle status)  
•    Influen ce of isoquercetin  on TFMP levels and change in TFMP levels over time. This 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_609101]. 
•    Cumulative incidence of VTE in patients with elevated TFMP and very elevated d -
dimer (> 1500 mcg/L) overall and according to randomization.  
•    Correlation between complete blood count, d- dimer,  ECOG, histology, stage, and 
TFMP levels will be determined by [CONTACT_609102] (Pearson or Spearman’s coefficients) .  
• Linear  regression modelling will be performed to assess the influence of 
chemotherapy, blood counts, growth factors, ECOG performance status on TFMP levels .  
• Fine and Graey  regressio n modelling will be performed to assess the influence of 
chemotherapy, blood counts, growth factors, ECOG performance status on VTE risk.  
• Quality of Life (QOL) will be assesses u sing EORTC QLQ -30 version 3 which is an 
internationally validated and widely utilized questionnaire.
57 Scoring is based on 
responses to 30 questions dealing with functional quality and symptom burden.  The questionnaire will be completed at baseline visit and end of treatment  assessments. All 
are rep orted on a range 0-100; a high score represents a high level of functioning and 
QOL. We will analyze the data using analysis of variance techniques if the QoL has 
constant variance across groups (based on VTE rates and treatment groups). If not, we will us e the Kruskal -Wallis test based on ranked QoL scores. If the questionnaire 
developers provide guidelines for scoring in the presence of missing data, we will

39 follow those guidelines. Alternatively, we will tally the number of questionnaires for 
which a par ticular data item is missing.  
 
• Correlation between isoquercetin  dose, plasma PDI inhibitory activity, and reduction 
in D- dimer or VTE incidence  
• Cumulative incidence of VTE according to Khorana score37  
• At completion of phase II portion, we will compare the cumulative incidence of VTE 
of all 60 patients enrolled with similar historical population. As described above the 
overall cumulative incidence of VTE with similar inclusion criteria and design was 11%. We hypothesize the cumulative incidence of VTE in the phase II cohort will be 4%. Based on these assumptions, the power for this comparison is 80% (N=60 with a 1-sided alpha of 0.1 comparing 4% to historical 11% c umulative incidence rate using a 
Fisher exact test.)

DF/HCC has chosen to use Authorizations, signed by [CONTACT_89438], rather than 
limited data sets with data use agreements.  
 
 3.6.1 DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol Confiden tiality  
 
All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the participant are strictly confidential. Whenever reasonably feasible, any participant specific reports (i.e. Pathology Reports, MRI Reports, Operative Reports, etc.) submitted to the Coordinating Center must have the participant’s full name & social security number “blacked out” and the assigned DF/HCC QACT case number (as described below) and DF/HCC protocol number written in (with the exception of the signed informed consent document). Participant initials may only be included or retained for cross verification of identification

copy of the registration  confirmation memo.  
 
 3.8  DF/HCC Protocol Case Number  
 
Once eligibility has been established and the participant successfully registered, the participant is assigned a five digit protocol case number.  This number is unique to the particip ant on this trial and must be used for QACT CRF/eCRF completion and 
correspondence, and correspondence with the Coordinating Center.   
 
3.9  Protocol Deviations, Exceptions and Violations 
 Federal Regulations require an IRB to review proposed changes in a research activity to 
ensure that researchers do not initiate changes i n approved research without IRB review 
and approval, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the participant. DF/HCC requires all departures from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB approved protocol to be reported to the DF/HCC Sponsor, who in turn is responsible for reporting to the DFCI IRB.  
  For reporting purposes, DF/HCC uses the terms “violation”, “deviation” and “exception” to describe derivations from a protocol. All Participating Institutions must adhere to these requirements for reporting to the DF/HCC Sponsor and will follow their institutional 
policy for reporting to their local IRB.  
 
3.9.1  Definitions  
 
Protocol Deviation: Any departure from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB -
approved protocol which is prospectively approved prior to its implementation.  
 
Protocol Exception:  Any protocol deviation that relates to the eligibility criteria, e.g.  
enrollment of a participant who does not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
   
Protocol Violation : Any protocol deviation that was not prospectively approved  by [CONTACT_143069].   
 
 3.9.2  Reporting Procedures  
 
DF/HCC Sponsor:  is responsible for ensuring that clear documentation is available in the 
medical record and/or regulato ry documents to describe all protocol exceptions, deviations 
and violations. The DF/HCC Sponsor will also be responsible for ensuring that all protocol violations/deviations are promptly reported per DFCI IRB guidelines.  
 
Participating Institutions : Proto col deviations require prospective approval from the DFCI 
IRB. The Participating Institution must submit the deviation request to the Coordinating Center who will then submit the deviation request to the DFCI IRB. Upon DFCI IRB

policy. A copy of the Participating Institution’s IRB report and determination will be forwarded to the Coordinating Center within [ADDRESS_807698] be sent to the Coordinating Center in a timely manner.   
Coordinating Center:   Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from the Participating 
Institution, the Coordinating Center will submit the report to the DF/HCC Sponsor for review. Subsequently, the  Participating Institution’s IRB violation/deviation report will be 
submitted to the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reporting guidelines. 
 
  
3.10  Safety Assessments and Toxicity Monitoring 
 
The study teams at all participating institutions are responsible for protecting the safety, rights and well- being of study participants. Recording and reporting of adverse events that 
occur during the course of a study help ensure the continuing safety of study participants.   All participants r eceiving investigational agents and/or other protocol mandated treatment 
will be evaluated for safety.   The safety parameters include all laboratory tests and hematological abnormalities, physical examination findings, and spontaneous reports of adverse events reported by [CONTACT_4317].  All toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated according to the NCI criteria specified in the protocol. Life- threatening toxicities 
must be reported immediately to the DF/HCC Sponsor via the Coordinating Cent er.  
 
The participating Institutions will review and submit to their IRB according to their 
institutional policies and procedures. . 
 
3.10.1  Guidelines for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
 
Guidelines for reporting Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Advers e Events (SAEs) are 
detailed in protocol section 10.2.       Participating Institutions must report the AEs to the DF/HCC Sponsor and the Coordinating Center following the DFCI IRB SAE Reporting Requirements.   The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of all Participating Institution Adverse Event reports and be responsible for communicating to all participating investigators, any observations reportable under the DFCI IRB Reporting Requirements.  Participating Investigators will review any distr ibuted AE reports, send a copy to their IRB 
according to their local IRB’s policies and procedures, and file a copy with their regulatory documents.  
 
  
Phase II/III trial of antithrombotic activity of isoquercetin  
October 27, [ADDRESS_807699] udies to notify the FDA and all participating 
investigators of any adverse experience associated with the use of the investigational agent that is both serious and unexpected. The DF /HCC Sponsor will review all IND Safety 
Reports and ensure that all IND Sa fety Reports are distributed to the Participating 
Institutions.  The Participating Institutions will review and submit to their IRB according to 
their institutional policies and procedures.   
   
3.11  Data Management 
 
The DF/HCC QACT develops a set of eith er pa per or electronic case report forms 
(CRF/eCRFs), for use with the protocol.  These forms are designed to collect data for each 
study. The DF/HCC QACT provides a web based training for eCRF users . 
   
3.11.1  Data Forms Review 
 
When data forms arrive at  the DF/HCC QACT, they are reviewed for completeness, 
protocol treatment compliance, adverse events (toxicities) and response. Data submissions are monitored for timeliness and completeness of submission. Participating Institutions are notified of their da ta submission delinquencies in accordance with the following: 
  
Incomplete or Questionable Data  
If study forms are received with missing or questionable data, the submitting institution will receive a written or electronic query from the DF/HCC QACT Data A nalyst or study 
monitor.  Responses to all queries should be completed and submitted within 14 calendar days.  Responses may be returned on the written query or on an amended paper case report form, or in the case of electronic queries, within the electronic data capture (eDC) system. In the case of a written query for data submitted on a paper case report form,  the query 
must be attached to the specific data being re -submitted in response.   
 
Missing Forms  
If study forms are not submitted on schedule, the Participating Institution will receive a 
Missing Form Report from the Coordinating Center noting the missing forms.  These reports are compi[INVESTIGATOR_163871]/HCC QACT and distributed a minimum of four times a year.  
 
4.0  REQUISITIONING INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG  
  The ordering of investigational agent is specified in the protocol.  Refer to section 6.4.9 for 
ordering information.  Participating Institutions should order their own agent regardless of the supplier (i.e., NCI or a pharmaceutical company.)

56 If the agent is investigational, ensure that the pharmacy will be able to receive and store the 
agent according to state and federal requirements. The local IRB should be kept informed of who will supply the agent (i.e., NCI or a pharmaceutical company) so that any regulatory 
responsibilities can be met in a timely fashion.
  
  
5.0  MONITORING: QUALITY CONTROL  
 
The quality control process for a clinical trial requires verification of protocol compliance and data accuracy. The Coordinating Center, with the aid of the QACT provides quality control oversight for the protocol. 
 
 5.[ADDRESS_807700] to on -site 
monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_5081].   The Coordinating Center will implement ongoing monitoring activities to ensure that Participating Institutions are complying with regulatory and protocol requirements, data quality, and participant safety. Monitoring will occur before the clinical phase  of the 
protocol begins, continue during protocol performance and through study completion. Additional monitoring practices may include but are not limited to; source verification, review and analysis of the following: eligibility requirements of all participants , informed consent procedures, adverse events and all associated documentation, study drug administration/treatment, regulatory files, protocol deviations, pharmacy records, response assessments, and data management.  
 Participating institutions will be required to participate in monthly Coordinating Center initiated teleconferences. “Newsletters” highlighting overall protocol progress and important announcements will be distributed regularly.  
 Virtual Monitoring  will be an ongoing process. Prior to enrolling patients, participating 
sites will be given templates for suggested binder organization as well as treatment 
checklists (See Appendix C)  in order to ensure all required data is captured.   Source 
documentation will be reviewed prior to enrollment of participants. All required correlative 
plasma samples will be tracked using template provided (see Appendix E).  All sites w ill 
use a data entry system which  provides a missing data report monthly for Coordinating 
Centers review. Participating Institu tions will provide Coordinating Center with Delegation 
of Authority logs within [ADDRESS_807701] de -identified copi[INVESTIGATOR_57912]’ medical record and source 
documents to the Coordinating Center to aid in source document verification.

All data submitted to  the DF/HCC QACT will be monitored for timeliness of submission, 
completeness, and adherence to protocol requirements. The Coordinating Center and if applicable, QACT Data Analysts assigned to the protocol, will perform the ongoing protocol data compliance monitoring.  Additional monitoring activities may occur at the discretion of the DF/HCC Sponsor if incidents on non- compliance are discovered.  
 
 5.2  Evaluation of Participating Institution Performance 
 
 5.2.1  Monitoring Reports  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all monitoring reports for on- site and virtual monitoring 
of Participating Institutions to ensure protocol compliance and ability to fulfill responsibilities of participating in the study. The DF/HCC Sponsor may increase the monitoring activities at Participating Institutions that are unable to comply with the protocol, DF/HCC Sponsor requirements or federal and local regulations. Participating Institutions may also be subject to an audit as determined by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Sponsor.  
 5.3 Accrual Monitoring  
 
Prior to extending a protocol to an external site, the DF/HCC Sponsor will establish accrual 
requirements for each participating institution. Accrual will be monitored for each participating institution by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Sponsor or designee. Sites that are not meeting 
their accrual expectations may be subject to termination.  As per the protocol feasibility 
questionnaires, all external sites are expected to enroll at least 2 -5 patients a year.  
 
 6.0  AUDITING: QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
Auditing is a method of Quality Assurance. Its main focus is to measure whether standards and procedures were followed. Auditing  is the systematic and independent examination of 
all trial related activities and documents.  Audits determine if evaluated activities were appropriately conducte d and whether data was generated, recorded and analyzed, and 
accurately reported per the protocol, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and the Code 
of Federal Regulations (CFR).  
 
 6.1  DF/HCC Sponsored Trials  
 
At a minimum, two on -site audits at each part icipating institution will be scheduled  by [CONTACT_609110].  A site will be eligible 
to be audited assuming at least three participants have received protocol treatment at that site.  The site would be eligible for a second on- site audit once an additional 5-[ADDRESS_807702] to additional audits if incidents of non- compliance are found.

 6.2  Participating Institution  
 
It is the Participating Institution’s responsibility to notify the Coordinating Center of all 
scheduled audit dates (internal) and re -audit dates (if applicable), which involve this 
protocol. All institutions will forward a copy of final audit and/or re -audit reports a nd 
corrective action plans (if applicable) to the Coordinating Center, within 12 weeks after the 
audit date.  
 
 6.3  DF/HCC Sponsor and Coordinating Center  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all final audit reports and corrective action plans if applicable. T he Coordinating Center, must forward these reports  to the DF/HCC QACT per 
DF/HCC policy for review by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Audit Committee. Based upon the audit assessments the DF/HCC Audit Committee could accept or conditionally accept the audit rating and final report. Conditional approval could require the DF/HCC Sponsor to implement recommendations or require further follow -up.  For unacceptable audits, the 
DF/HCC Audit Committee would forward the final audit report and corrective action plan to the DFCI IRB as applicable.

Mixing IQC-950AN capsule contents with food  
Quercegen Pharma.  2015- 10-[ADDRESS_807722] that capsule contents are 
released in the stomach, and the stability of IQC-950AN is expected to be good in the stomach.  The 
capsule contents are light yellow colored and the powder is lightly acidic with an otherwise neutral to 
slightly bitter taste. The capsules can be opened and the contents mixed with a small portion of soft 
food. The capsules are “locking” , but not sealed, so they can be opened with some twisting and pulling 
over the food however it is recommended that the opening and emptying be performed for the subject  
as the capsules are tightly filled and assuring full emptying is important.  
The contents are not strong-tasting so it is not necessary to make extra efforts to mask the taste.  It is 
recommended to mix the capsule contents with an already acidic soft-food as this will blend well with 
the taste. It is not recommended to disperse in a liquid because of low solubility and possibility of 
powder sticking to container walls .  
Since the capsule contents are yellow colored, it is recommended to use a yellowish soft-food which is 
readily available such as puree of carrots or pumpkin puree, or a darker soft food such as prune puree. 
However, for dosing consistency a single option or fewer options are recommended.  
Suggested instructions; 
A. Carefully twist off the top portion of the capsule over the soft-food you plan to use. Rolling the 
capsules helps with emptying. 
 
B. Sprinkle the contents of the capsule on a small amount of room temperature acidic food,  we 
recommend  puree of  carrots or pumpkin puree. It is important to verify complete transfer.   
C. Swallow the capsule contents in the soft food mixture right away, and follow with enough water 
to make sure the contents of the capsules are swallowed completely. Do not store the capsule content 
mixed with food for later use.  

Related Information on Stability in Aqueous Suspensions  
It is recommended to use the IQC-950AN capsule content with a lightly acidic soft-food and cool or cold 
temperatures soon after preparation.   
Standard Dissolution Testing of the IQC-950AN capsules shows that the contents are released in the 
stomach (see GMP release documents).   It is also known that isoquercetin (the active component of  
IQC-950AN) is stable during incubation with gastric content preparations (Chang et al ., 2005; Zuo et al.,  
2006). 
The stability of the parent quercetin molecule is both pH and temperature dependent, with acidic 
conditions and lower temperatures assuring the stability of quercetin suspensions.  In an acidic aqueous 
suspension (pH 2.7) and refrigerator temperature ( 4 °C)  quercetin remained stable for the duration of 
the storage period (96 hours) while greater than 80% of quercetin was recovered in the pH 7 system.  At 
room temperature, the stability of quercetin was reduced, such that 50% and 20% of quercetin 
degraded in the first 25 hours at pH 7 and 2.7, respectively ( Moon et al., 2008) . 
With the proposed conditions there should not be a significant difference between the use of filled 
capsules or the use of capsule contents consumed within a soft-food.

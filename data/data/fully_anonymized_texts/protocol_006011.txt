This study facilitates  the collection and analysis of  outcome  data for patients with dyskeratosis 
congenita (DC) or severe aplastic anemia (SAA)  undergoing a hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT).  
 
Study Design:  This is a treatment study us ing a fludarabine -based preparative regimen 
followed by a  related or unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant .  Five different preparative regimens are included based o n 
disease and donor type.  
  
Patient 
Population : Persons [ADDRESS_1212027] bone marrow failure chacat erized by a requirment 
for red blood cell and platelet transfusions , or require a second transplant  
due to graft failure . 
 
Endpoin ts: Specific transplant related endpoints include incid ence of:  
• neutrophil engraftment at day 42 and platelet engra ftment at 1 year  
• regimen related morality at 100 days  
• acute GVHD at 100 days  
• chronic GVHD at 6 months and 1 year  
• secondary malignancies

February 15, 2021  Page 6 of 30  CPRC # 2013OC127  1.0 Introduction and Rationale 
This is a treatment study for the use of  hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) for d yskeratosis congenita  (DC) and severe aplastic anemia (SAA) .  
Based on the previous University of Minnesota study MT2006 -06, this 
protocol  offers a conditioning regimen that is less intensive but with 
adequate immunosuppressive activity to promote engra ftment of HSC from 
related and unrelated  donors . The modification eliminates the  total body 
irradiation (TBI) from the DC preparative  regimen  only. It additionally 
expands donor options with haploidentical T -replete post -transplant 
cyclophosphamide based conditioning regimens.  
 
Idiopathic severe aplastic anemia treatment focuses o n disruption of an 
immune -mediated destruction of hematop oietic stem cells or the bone 
marrow niche, with either systemic immunosuppressive th erapy (IST)  or 
HSCT1. Historically, up -front HSCT was offered only for patients with an 
HLA-matched related donor. However, more recent compell ing data 
supports equivalent overall survival (IST 82%, MUD HSC T 77%)[ADDRESS_1212028] is limited by [CONTACT_105] -response in 30% of 
patients3, relapse in 40%4, clonal evolution of myelodysplastic or leukemia 
clones in 20%5 and delayed recovery of cell counts (3 -4 months).  Additional 
improvements in HSCT outcomes have been recognized with decreased 
irradiation6 and addition of fludarabine7 in the conditioning regimen. Finally, 
the gap in outcomes between recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -matched related donors 
and unrelated  donors has been eliminated8-11. More recently, the donor pool 
has been expanded to include haploidentical donors, w ith results reviewed 
bu DeZern and Brodsky, 201812.  
   
Literature on HSCT in DC continues to support non -myeloablative or 
reduced intensity conditioning regimens13-15. Evidence suggests that 
radiation -free conditioning does not compromise hematopoietic 
engraftment16,17.It does however  eliminate radiation related extra -medullary 
toxicity (especially to the lung and liver) , a concern since pulmonary fibrosis 
and liver cirrhosis  are a part of disease phenotype . While matched related 
donor HSCT has the best outcome in DC, success has been reported with 
alternative donor18 and haploidentical HSCT19-21. With regard to 
haploidentical donor HSCT, use of post -transplant cyclophosphamide 
(PTCy) may be particularly detrimental to patients wi th DC, contributing to 
pulmonary and liver toxicity and increased risk for fu ture carcinomas. Luznik 
et al. reported on comparison of 1 versus 2 days of P TCy, showing 
MT2013 -34C:  HSCT for Patients with Dyskeratosis Congenita or Severe Aplastic Anemia   
 
   
February 15, 2021  Page 7 of 30  CPRC # 2013OC127  equivalent outcomes with regard to acute graft -versus -host disease 
(GvHD)22. More recently, the Kanakry lab carefully examined  exact timing 
of PTCy dosing in murine models, identifying day +[ADDRESS_1212029] with a haploidentical donor, we will li mit alkylator exposure 
by [CONTACT_868521] g single dose day +[ADDRESS_1212030] experience d graft failure (GF) early after 
stem cell infusion. At the University of Minnesota, t he incidence of graft 
failure by [CONTACT_4475] 50 is 7 – 10%, creating a necessity for 2nd transplant treatment 
options for these patients .  
 
Patients consent to allow the analysis of routine clini cal data collected and 
maintain ed in OnCore, the Masonic Cancer Center’s (MCC) clinical 
database, and specific transplant related endpoints i n the Un iversity Of 
Minnesota Blood and Bone Marrow Database as part of  the historical 
database maintained by [CONTACT_8569].    
 
Endpoints  include incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 42 and platelet 
engraftment at 1 year, regimen related morality at 100 day s, acute GVHD 
at 100 days , chronic GVHD at 6 and 12 months, and secondary 
malignancies.

February 15, 2021  Page 14  of 30  CPRC # 2013OC127  [IP_ADDRESS]  Total Body Irradiation (Arms B and E only)  
2 Gy administered in a single fraction will be given at a dose rate 
between  1 and 1.9 Gy/minute prescribed to the midplane of the 
patient at the level of the umbilicus.  
 
The total body irradiation will be delivered with r ight and left lateral 
fields, with the patient supi[INVESTIGATOR_72301] a specially design ed couch.  
 
Total body irradiation will be delivered with a linear accelerator using 
6, 18, or 24 MV X -rays.  
 
Based on measurements of transverse thicknesses, alumi num 
compensators may be used to ensure that the dose homog eneity 
across the field is within 10% of the prescribed dose.  Usually  
head/neck, leg and lung compensators are used (altho ugh based on 
calculated mid -mediastinal doses, lung compensators are often not 
needed).  
 
A beam “spoiler” will be used to ensure a full skin d ose.  Half value 
layer lung and kidney blocks will not be utilized.   Testicular boosts 
are not given.  
4.3 Cell Infusion (day 0)  
Refer to section 2.2 for cell source options and section 5 for selection 
considerations . 
 
On day 0 the cells will be infused per cell source sp ecific institutional 
guidelines.   
 
Recommended Pre-medication:  acetaminophen 15 mg/kg (max 
dose = 650 mg ) PO and diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg (max dose 50 
mg) PO/IV  with adjusted dosing for pediatric patients.  
 
Vital signs will be checked before and after the inf usion, and one hour 
post infusion  per University Of Minnesota  transplant guidelines .  
More frequent vital signs may be required depending  on reactions to 
the product infusion.

4.5.2  Tacrolimus (All Arms)  
Tacrolimus  therapy will begin on day -3 (Arms A, B, C) or day +5 (Arms 
D, E) .  Initial d osing of tacrolimus  will be 0.03 mg/kg/ day IV via 
continuous infusion . Goal trough levels will be 10 -15 ug/mL for the first 
[ADDRESS_1212038] -transplant and then decreased to a goal of 5 -10 ng/mL 
thereafter. Dose adjustments will be made on the ba sis of toxicity 
and/or tacrolimus levels outside of goal range. Con version from IV to 
oral tacrolimus will be done as the patient tolerat es and prior to 
discharge. Potential toxicities are detailed in App endix II.   
The timing of the tacrolimus taper will be at the d iscretion of the treating 
physician, but in  general:  
• Taper begins at day +100  +/- 10 days , if the patient is stably  
engrafted and has no active GVHD.   
Taper to zero by [CONTACT_868523] 10%  a week 
(rounded to nearest pi[INVESTIGATOR_406010]), with a goal to discon tinue by [CONTACT_24473] [ADDRESS_1212039]. 
 
In the presence of severe tacrolimus toxicities, oth er alternative 
agents may be used after review and approval by [CONTACT_978]. 
4.5.3  Mycophenylate Mofetil (MMF) 
Mycophenylate mofetil (MMF) therapy will begin  on day -3 (Arms A, B,

February 15, 2021  Page 16  of 30  CPRC # 2013OC127  times daily up to a max of 1gm per dose.  The same dosage is used 
orally or intravenously. Consider dose modification  if renal and/or 
hepatic impairment (GFR<25 mL/minute corrected). Th e first MMF 
pharmacokinetic time point will be obtained at day +3  (Arms A, B, C ) 
or day +11 (Arms  D, E). An attempt will be made to maintain an MMF 
AUC of 200 - 250 ng *hr/mL  for q8h dosing and an AUC of 300 -350 
ng*hr/ml for q12h dosing . Should dose adjustments be made, repeat 
AUC mon itoring at steady -state should be considered.  
Stop MMF at Day + 30 (Arms A, B, and C), Day +35 (Arms D and E)  or 
7 days after engraftment achieved (ANC>500 x 106 neutrophils/L x 3 
days)  if later than day +30 (Arms A, B, and C) or day +35  (Arms D and 
E). If sufficient acute GvHD is observed to require systemic therapy, 
MMF should be continued for [ADDRESS_1212040] supportive transplant  care, including 
antibacterial/ antifungal/ antiviral prophylaxis  according to institutional 
guidelines or as modified based on clinical paramete rs. 
Patients will be eligible for any supportive care stud ies regarding 
infectious disease prophylaxis and management, immuno globulin 
support, etc. as appropriate . 
 
5.0 Donor Selection and Cell Dose Requirements  
5.1 Donor specific HLA antibodies:  
Absence of donor -specific HLA antibodies is preferred [negative flow 
cytometric cross -match assay or the mean fluorescence intensity 
(MFI) of any anti -donor HLA antibody by [CONTACT_496231] 
<1000]. If donor -specific anti -HLA antibodies cannot be avoided, the 
risks will be discussed with the patient and consenting 
parent/guardian and options including debulking or d eferring 
transplant will be considered  
MT2013 -34C:  HSCT for Patients with Dyskeratosis Congenita or Severe Aplastic Anemia   
 
   
February 15, 2021  Page 17  of 30  CPRC # 2013OC127  5.2 Donor Considerations When More Than 1 Potential Donor  
• Bone marrow is preferred over peripheral blood. Per ipheral blood 
is preferred over cord blood.  
• HLA-matched related donor bone marrow is optimal, follow ed by 
[CONTACT_44688]-matched unrelated donor cell sources. If HLA -matched 
sources are not available, the lowest number of mismatches in 
the host -versus -graft direction is prioritized to minimize graft 
rejection.  
• If more than one donor with the same degree of HLA match, 
absent or equivalent donor -specific anti -HLA antibodies, and 
equivalen t host -versus -graft allele mismatches, the following 
prioritization will be used:  
a. Homozygous normal donor is preferable to heterozygote  
(carrier)  
b. ABO -compatible donor is preferable to ABO -incompatible 
donor  
c. CMV status 
1) For a CMV seronegative patient, prefer a CMV 
seronegative donor  
2) For a CMV seropositive patient, prefer a CMV ser opositive 
donor  
d. Younger donor is preferable to older, avoiding those  >55 
years of age if possible  
e. Male donor preferred over nulliparous female donor over 
multiparous female donor  
5.3 Donor Considerations for 2nd Transplant  
• In the case of 2nd transplant, the original donor source, if willing 
and available, is preferred  
• If original donor not available, any readily availa ble graft source 
as per section 2.2 will be considered  
5.4 Cell Dose Requirements Based on Cell Source   
5.4.1  Bone Marrow  (BM)  
BM will be collected with a goal of >5.0 x 108 nucleated cells/kg 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_868519]2012 -14C (for related donor) or NMDP 
guidelines (for unrelated donor).  
5.4.2  Peripheral Blood  (PB)

Related donor:  If donor is > 12 years and > [ADDRESS_1212041] ed 
after G -CSF mobilization per MT2012 -14C.  
 
Unrelated donor:   The PB  product will be collected, processed and 
shipped according to the existing protocols of the Nati onal Marrow 
Donor Program to obtain GCSF mobilized PB for prima ry allogeneic 
HSC transplant with unrelated donors.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_1212042] Blood (UCB)  
For umbilical co rd blood, a  minimum cell dose of ≥ 3.5 x 107 
nucleated cells/kg is required with an  optimal cell dose ≥ 5 x 107 
nucleated cells/kg  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16148].  The unit(s) will not be

Diagnosis  
 
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  – regardless of stem cell source  
• nausea and vomiting  
• possible allergic reaction (including itching, hive s, flushing [red face], shortness of breath, 
wheezing, chest  tightness, skin rash, fever, chills, stiff muscles,  or trouble breathing)  
• graft-versus -host-disease (GVHD)  
• veno -occlusive disease ,  
• mucositis ,  
• infections ( sepsis )  
 
Risks  associated with the use of Umbilical Cord Blood  
• DMSO Toxicity  is a possible complica tion of UCB infusion and occurs due to the presence  of 
DMSO in the thawed product. The risk of toxicity in creases with the number of units (total 
volume per kg body weight) infused. Symptoms are du e to histamine release and include:  
• cough  
• flushing  
• rash 
• chest tightness  
• nausea and vomiting  
• bradycardia and tachycardia  
• hypertension  
 
• Bacterial/Endotoxin Contamination  of cellular therapy products may occur, but rarely 
cause acute, severe or life threatening effects. Ho wever, the onset of high fever (>2ºC or 
>3.5ºF rise in temperature), severe chills, hypotensio n, or circulatory collapse during or 
immediately after infusion should suggest the possi bility of bacterial contamination and/or the 
presence of endotoxin in the product.  
 
• Transmission of Infectious Disease  may occur because cellular therapy products are 
collected from human body and/or tissues. The donor  selection criteria do not totally eliminate 
the risk of transmitting the agents currently teste d such as HIV, HTLV, HBV, HCV, CMV, T. 
pallidum (Syphilis), West Nile Virus, and Trypanoso me (Chagas).   For some other infectious 
disease  there are no routine tests to prevent disease trans mission including Parvovirus spp., 
Plasmodium spp. (Malaria), the coronavirus associat ed with severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_244089] (SARS), and the agents of human transmissi ble spongiform encephalopathies 
(TSEs).

Common  Less Common  Rare  
• none  
 • bone and muscle pain  
• abnormal blood tests which 
suggest that the drug is 
affecting the liver  
 • fast heartbeat  
• low blood pressure  
• allergic reaction (may include 
shortness of breath, 
wheezing, swelling in the 
mouth or throat, hives, itching, 
flushing, or fever)

double-masking, and any reference to 
single-masking has been replaced accordingly.The study is considered double-masked because 
the patient and investigator are masked.
Exclusion Criteria 5: History of IVT, 
subconjunctival, or periocular steroids in the 
3 months prior to screening conflicts with 
Exclusion Criteria 13: History of systemic and 
intraocular steroid use for 6 months prior to 
Day 1. The use of intravitreal nonbiodegradable 
steroid implants (ex. Iluvien®, Yutiq®, 
Retisert® is prohibited.
Exclusion Criteria #5 has been removed.
[Section Number 4.6 Exclusion Criteria]Retaining Exclusion Criteria #13 (now 
documented as #12 in this amendment) as a 
higher standard reflects the scientific rigor and 
safety precautions taken in this study 
population.
Post-dilution solutions for clinical 
administration will be held no more than 1 hour 
at room temperature prior to administration to 
the patient.
[Section Number 6.1.1 UBX1325]The original hold times and conditions were 
inaccurate. This change was made to align with 
guidance in the Pharmacy Manual.

UNITY Biotechnology, Inc Page 3 ConfidentialSUMMARY OF CHANGES: AMENDMENT [ADDRESS_735941] been made to provide 
clarity and are captured in the redlined document. 
The principal components of change to the study are described in the table below. 
Area of Change Rationale
Screening window was increased from 
28 days to 42 days
[Section 1.2 Schedule of Events Table 1] and 
[Section [ADDRESS_735942]] Linking the window acceptable for screening 
period to coincide with the optimal timing post last 
anti-VEGF injection (see item 3). The number of 
days permitted for screening is increased to avoid a 
patient falling outside the screening window due to 
when they received their last anti-VEGF treatment 
and having to rescreen.
Removal of reference to dose starting at 5 µg 
[Section 4.2.2 Dose Rationale] 10 µg was confirmed safe per the Safety 
Assessment Committee (SAC) in UBX1325-[ADDRESS_735943] anti-VEGF given 
was changed from between 3 and 5 weeks 
prior to day 1, to between 3 and 6 weeks 
prior to day 1
[Section 4.5 Inclusion Criteria] Matching the time from last anti-VEGF injection to 
best capture response sensitivity (i.e., long enough
from last anti-VEGF injection to avoid anti-VEGF 
induced inhibition of activity but short enough to 
avoid re-emergence of active neovascularization 
and inflammation). This increases the likelihood of 
differentiating between UBX1325 and sham treated 
patients. Furthermore, the window of 3–[ADDRESS_735944] DME (ETDRS-DRSS Score at 
65C [or DR severity level of 8] or less 
severe) to participate in this study
[Section 4.5 Inclusion Criteria]Based on preclinical animal studies and impact on 
neovascularization, there is sufficient data to 
support the hypothesis that there could be a 
potential effect of UBX1325 on PDR patients.
Stratification by [CONTACT_14181]-VEGF treatment agents
[Section 6.2 Method for Assigning Patients 
to the Treatment Group]To obtain a balance between UBX1325 and sham 
treatment arms with regards to prior anti-VEGF 
agents.
Established that a formal interim analysis 
will occur at 12 weeks
[Section 8.7 Planned Interim Analysis] Revised the plan for analysis to reflect a planned 
interim analysis at 12 weeks after a certain 
proportion of patients meet the 12-week timepoint 
as will be determined in the SAP. Based on
UBX1325-01 data, we believe study drug effects 
may be seen earlier at 8–12 weeks. This is also to 
ensure the safety and well-being of patients at 
12-week timepoint.
Clinical Study Protocol UBX1325-02
Protocol Amendment 4/Version 5.0

Changed rescue criteria from “worsening 
CST by 100 µm from Baseline (Day 1) per 
SD-OCT or a 10-letter decrease in BCVA 
compared to peak BCVA from Baseline 
(Day 1)” to “worsening CST by 75 µm from 
Baseline (Day 1) per SD-OCT and/or a 
10-letter decrease in BCVA compared to 
peak BCVA from Baseline (Day 1)”

Protocol Amendment 4/Version 5.0
UNITY Biotechnology, Inc Page 5 ConfidentialSUMMARY OF CHANGES: AMENDMENT [ADDRESS_735945] been made to provide 
clarity and are captured in the redlined document. 
The principal components of change to the study are described in the table below. 
Area of Change Rationale
Inclusion Criteria 2: clarified DRSS will be 
determined by a Central Reading Center and 
re-incorporated the requirement for having at least 
3 anti-VEGF treatments in the preceding 6 months
Inclusion Criteria 3: CST requirement was reduced 
Inclusion Criteria 5: BCVA requirement in non-
study has been removed since safety was 
established
23 mmHg requirement 
applies to Day 1
Exclusion Criteria 1: removed definition of high 
risk/active PDR as Inclusion Criteria 2 is more 
explicit
Exclusion Criteria 9: patients with glaucoma who 
are poorly controlled in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_559904] 3 meds (new language 
explicitly excludes patients with unstable 
glaucoma)
Exclusion Criteria 12: prior steroid use applies to 
study eye only
[Section 4.5 Inclusion Criteria] and 
[Section 4.6 Exclusion Criteria]Eligibility criteria revised to address 1 or 
more issues:
Remove redundancies
Remove specific criteria put in place 
before additional safety data was 
ascertained in the First-in-Human 
study
Clarify requirements
Better align with patient population
Reordering of secondary endpoints putting BCVA 
changes at the top of the list
[Section 1 Synopsis] and [Section 3 Objectives and 
Endpoints] and [Section 8 Statistical Methods]Change of CST enrollment requirement may 
limit the magnitude of change from baseline 
in CST, while BCVA is deemed less 
sensitive to this change.
PK sampling was removed as a study procedure 
and subsequently as an endpoint
[Section 1 Synopsis] and 
[Section 1.2 Schedule of Events Table 1] and 
[Section [ADDRESS_735946]]An adequate number of PK samples were 
collected in the First-in-Human study and 
analysis confirmed there is no evidence of 
systemic exposure of UBX0601/UBX1325
Removal of Australia and New Zealand as 
participating countries [Section 1 Synopsis]The Sponsor opted to conduct the study 
within North America only

Inclusion Criteria 2: Revised the requirement for 
having at least [ADDRESS_735948] 2 anti-VEGF 
treatments in the preceding 6 months
Inclusion Criteria 4: Upper BCVA limit in study 
eye changed from 70 letters to 73 letters
Exclusion Criteria 20: replaced reference to permit 
non-facial basal cell carcinoma with reference to 
permit stable, superficial basal or squamous cell 
carcinoma of the skin
[Section 4.5 Inclusion Criteria ] and 
[Section 4.6 Exclusion Criteria ]Eligibility criteria were revised to clarify 
requirements and/or better align with patient 
population
Extended the follow-up period from 24 weeks to 
48 weeks, subsequently, the number of visits 
increased from 9 to 12. The secondary and 
exploratory endpoints apply to Week 48
[Section 1 Synopsis ] and 
[Section 1.2 Schedule of Events Table 1 ] and 
[Section 3 Objectives and Endpoints ] and 
[Section [ADDRESS_735949] ]To assess the extent of durability of a single 
IVT injection of UBX1325
As of November 9, 2021, additional data became 
available supporting the ongoing safety profile of 
UBX1325
[Section 2.3.5 Benefit: Risk Assessment ] 
[Section 4.2.2 Dose Rationale ]The safety summary was revised to reflect 
additional non-serious, non-drug related 
adverse eventsClarified that the pre-dose assessments, specifically 
Anterior Segment Evaluation, Posterior Segment 
Evaluation and IOP are done OU, however, only the 
study eye should be assessed post-dose
[Section 1.2 Schedule of Events Table 1 ] and 
[Section [ADDRESS_735950] ]This clarifies required pre- and post-dose 
assessments
The following data will be collected for both eyes in 
the preceding 6 months prior to screening: use of 
anti- VEGF and historical imaging and visual acuity 
assessments
[Section 5.1.3 Medical History and Concomitant 
Medication Review]This allows us to have better access to data 
as to patient’s prior treatment history; such 
prior treatment could be a useful tool in 
assessing patients who are most likely to 
respond well to UBX1325

Clarified that patients, investigators, visual acuity 
technicians, photographers, reading center 
personnel and Sponsor are masked.
[Section 6.6 Masked and Unmasked Study Staff ]To clarify who is masked in this double-
masked study
The following changes were made to the section on 
prohibited treatments.
Removed this statement: There are no known 
contraindications to the administration of UBX1325 
injection
Revised this statement: Patients should not have 
received any therapy that would preclude an IVT 
injection or can potentially exhibit retinal toxicity 
(such as tamoxifen, hydroxychloroquine and 
trastuzumab).
[Section 6.8.2 Prohibited Treatments ]Safety has been established in the First-in-
Human study and prohibited medication 
statement was further clarified with specific 
examples
Added that interim analyses may be conducted at

UNITY Biotechnology, Inc Page 25 Confidential2 INTRODUCTION
UBX1325 is a new molecular entity that is being investigated by [CONTACT_516317], Inc. 
(the Sponsor) for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME).
DME is a complication of diabetic retinopathy (DR) following chronic, poorly controlled 
diabetes, and is the most common form of sight-threatening retinopathy in people with 
diabetes ( Tan et al., 2016, IDF 2019). Approximately one in 14 patients with diabetes has 
some degree of DME ( Coney 2019).
The overall prevalence of DR in patients with diabetes using retinal images was estimated to
be 35%, with vision-threatening DR present in 12% ( WHO 2015). Prevalence depends on the 
type of diabetes and the duration of the disease. For both types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes 
(T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), after 25 years duration, prevalence approximates 30% 
(Browning et al., 2018).
In the US, at least 5.[ADDRESS_735968] DME. According to 
some estimates, only 40% of them diagnosed and treated, and about 5% are diagnosed and

formation and intraretinal hemorrhages. Microvascular damage (e.g., retinal capi[INVESTIGATOR_559909]-perfusion, cotton wool spots, increased numbers of hemorrhages, venous abnormalities, 
and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities) leads to increased vasopermeability, which can 
subsequently result in retinal thickening and/or exudates that may lead to loss in central visual 
acuity (VA).
When blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is further compromised, pooling of fluid within the

glycemic control, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia. If untreated, 29% of eyes with 
DME and foveal involvement experience moderate visual loss (doubling of the visual angle) 
after [ADDRESS_735970] 3 Early Treatment
Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) lines occurring in 5% of cases ( Bandello et al., 2017 ).
No difference in the prevalence of DME was observed when subjects were analyzed by [CONTACT_559928]; however, non-Hispanic black subjects had a greater odd of having DME compared 
with non-Hispanic white subjects ( Varma et al. 2014 ). Systemic risk factors associated with
DME include longer duration of diabetes, high systolic blood pressure, and elevated 
hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels. Other studies found that lipid and triglyceride levels, 
advanced diabetic nephropathy, and pregnancy are also associated risk factors. The sole 
ocular factor associated with DME is DR severity as increasing severity is associated with 
increasing prevalence of DME ( Browning et al., 2018 ,Kim et al., 2019).
The macula in DME is thickened due to increased extracellular fluid derived from 
hyperpermeable retinal capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037]. Prolonged hyperglycemia in uncontrolled diabetes leads 
to reduced inner retinal oxygen tension, venous dilation, increased vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) concentration within the retina, leukocyte stasis, and dysregulated 
growth factor levels, which together are associated with increased exudation of serum out of 
the retinal vasculature and into the extracellular space. The retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] (RPE) 
pump is overwhelmed by [CONTACT_559929]
(Browning et al., 2018 ).
While the underlying pathophysiology of DME is believed to be VEGF-mediated, there is a
growing body of evidence suggesting that inflammatory mediators and cytokines contribute 
to the vascular permeability and edema in DME ( Ascaso et al., 2014,
Owen and Hartnett 2013, Browning et al., 2018 ). Increased inflammation, characterized by 
[CONTACT_559930], accumulation of macrophages, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and 
prostacyclin upregulation is associated with capi[INVESTIGATOR_211650]-perfusion and breakdown of BRB 
(Browning et al., 2018). Patients with DME have elevated vitreous levels of VEGF, ICAM-1, 
interleukin (IL)-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 compared with non-diabetic 
patients ( Funatsu et al., 2009).
Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factors alpha and beta, alpha 4 integrin, nitric 
oxide, and IL-dysfunction and increased vascular permeability through a local inflammatory response and 
higher levels of advanced glycation end products ( Miljanovic et al., 2004). Many other small 
molecules and growth factors may contribute to the development of DME, although the
details of the pertinent pathways are incompletely understood ( Kent et al., 2000;
Patel et al., 2006, Browning et al., 2018 ).

Protocol Amendment 4/Version 5.[ADDRESS_735971] of care for DME for decades. However, a substantial
group of patients are unresponsive to laser therapy and fail to improve after photocoagulation 
(Bandello et al., 2017). Some studies show that conventional photocoagulation is effective in 
reducing macular thickness in patients with DME; however, it causes visible laser scars that
may enlarge once treatment is finished. In addition, the thermal effects of photocoagulation 
cantrigger complications, including choroidal neovascularization, subretinal fibrosis, and 
visual fieldloss. Subthreshold diode micropulse laser therapy (SDM) and selective retinal 
therapy (SRT) may be valuable for treating sub-clinically significant DME that is diagnosed 
early ( Park et al., 2014). However, given the risk of progression and general lack of early
detection, in addition to AEs, other treatment modalities for DME have been investigated. 
Intravitreal (IVT) administration of steroids has provided promising results for the treatment 
of DME ( Sarao et al., 2014 ). The anti-inflammatory, angiostatic, and antipermeability 
properties of these compounds have gained interest in chronic retinal conditions such as 
DME. A complete understanding of the mechanism of action of corticosteroids has not been 
fully clarified.
However, corticosteroids have been shown to interfere with many regulatory components of 
gene expression inhibiting the expression of VEGF and key proinflammatory genes (tumor 
anti- inflammatory factors (pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836]-derived growth factor [PEDF]) 
(Tsaprouni et al., 2002 ;Tong et al., 2006 ; Kim et al., 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2006). The 
anti-inflammatory activity of steroids is also related to the inhibition of the phospholipase A 
[ADDRESS_735972], to the lower release of inflammatory cell mediators, and to the reduced leukocyte 
chemotaxis ( Bandello et al. 2017). Additionally, triamcinolone acetonide (TA) seems to 
reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and down-regulates ICAM-1 on 
choroidal endothelial cells ( Mizuno et al., 2007 ). IVT and peribulbar injections of TA must 
be repeated every [ADDRESS_735973] been 
studied, for example, biodegradable dexamethasone extended release implant (Ozurdex®), 
fluocinolone acetonide (Iluvien®) and TA implants to prolong the intervals between
treatments ( Bandello et al., 2017).
Side effects of steroids are a concern, especially considering the availability of anti-VEGF
medications that have minimal ocular side effects. The primary risks associated with IVT
administration of corticosteroids for DME are cataract progression and development of
glaucoma, which is why it is sometimes contraindicated in patients with glaucoma or ocular 
hypertension. Nonetheless, steroid treatment can be considered first line in special 
populations such as, patients who have had a recent history of cardiovascular event, pregnant 
women, patients unable to adhere to monthly treatments, or DME in eyes undergoing cataract 
surgery ( Zur et al., 2019 ).
Surgical vitrectomy was proposed as a treatment option for DME in the early 1990s. Eyes 
with DME were observed to have lower prevalence of posterior vitreous detachment than 
eyes without DME, and it was thought that vitreomacular adhesion might promote DME. 
This was further supported by [CONTACT_559931]1325-02
Protocol Amendment 4/Version 5.0
UNITY Biotechnology, Inc Page 28 Confidentialposterior vitreous detachment and surgical induction of a vitreomacular separation might 
improve DME. With the advent of optical coherence tomography (OCT), vitreomacular 
adhesion was shown to be a risk factor for DME ( Browning et al., 2018). A controversy exists 
regarding the effects of vitrectomy for DME. Some reports suggest that vitrectomy reduces 
macular thickening but does not improve VA, yet others report improved VA and decrease in 
macular thickening. Prospective, randomized clinical studies have not been conducted to 
evaluate the effect of vitrectomy on diverse DME patient population. Nonetheless, there is a 
general acceptance that vitrectomy has a role in the management of at least some cases of 
DME ( Browning et al., 2018 ).
Studies have shown the safety and efficacy of IVT anti-VEGF treatments in patients with 
DME, some of which were the basis for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of 
anti-VEGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_559911] ( Elman et al., 2010; Nguyen et al. 2012 ; 
Brown et al., 2015).The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR) net trial, 
Protocol T, was a 660-patient study comparing 3 IVT anti-VEGF treatments in patients with
DME, followed for 2 years of treatment. Focal/grid laser was added if DME persisted and 
was not improving at 6 months or later. Results showed that focal/grid laser was administered
as a supplement in 41%, 64%, and 52% of aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab 
groups, respectively. From  Baseline to 2 years, mean VA letter score improved by 12.8 with 
aflibercept, 10.0 with bevacizumab, and 12.3 with ranibizumab. Treatment group differences 
varied by [CONTACT_559932] ( Wells et al. 2016).
A meta-analysis published by [CONTACT_559933]., 2018 concluded that anti-VEGF treatments are
effective at improving vision in patients with DME with 3 to 4 in every 10 patients likely to
experience an improvement of 3 or more lines VA at 1 year. Aflibercept may confer some
advantage over ranibizumab and bevacizumab in patients with DME at one year in visual and
anatomic terms, but it is unclear whether this applied to the long-term. Overall, the safety 
profile between the 3 anti-VEGF drugs, aflibercept, ranibizumab, or bevacizumab is similar 
(Virgili et al., 2018).
Evidence from randomized controlled trials may not apply to real-world practice, where 
patients in need of anti-VEGF treatment are often under treated and under monitored. In a 
number of studies, the full effect of anti-VEGF agents are not even experienced for up to

important role in the treatment of this disease.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_559912]-VEGF treatment for DME, patients’ poor compliance 
with the regimen (monthly and/or bimonthly IVT injections or a treat-and-extend regimen),
refractory cases to anti-VEGF treatment (50% of DME patients ( AAO PPP for AMD 2019;
AAO PPP for DR 2017), the long-term complication of retinal fibrosis and the prolonged 
time it takes to achieve maximal response account for the unmet need that remains in DME. 
Although VEGF has been identified as a primary biomarker for the neovascular disease, other 
biomarkers are present in DR (including IL-1, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]- , IL-6, tumor
growth factor [TGF- ], among others) and it could be argued that anti-VEGF treatment alone 
does not address the multifactorial nature of the disease.

2.3 Scientific Rationale for UBX1325 as a Treatment for DME
The Sponsor hypothesizes that the accumulation of senescent cells (SnCs) in the retina
contributes to retinal disease. UBX1325 is a phosphate pro-drug of the active parent 
molecule, UBX0601, an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in the retina. Inhibition 
of Bcl-xL leads to induction of apoptosis, ultimately leading to cell death. In preclinical 
studies, activation of the apoptotic cascade was selective for animals with a senescent cell 
burden. IVT administration of UBX1325 in diabetic animals led to improvements in retinal 
vascular leakage, providing support for the treatment of DME.
2.3.[ADDRESS_735975] 
Hayflick ( Hayflick and Moorhead 1961). Several important features of the senescence 
program have since been elucidated. Exposure to damage-inducing stimuli such as oxidative 
stress, radiation, and ischemia are among factors associated with the induction of senescence. 
Several studies ( Marazita et al., 2016; Lamoke et al., 2015; Ma and Wong 2016) have 
confirmed the correlation between these stressors and angiogenic retinal disease.
SnCs produce a set of proinflammatory factors, cytokines, chemokines, and others that are 
called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Although many factors of 
SASP have been identified in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and 
DR, a list of the most relevant ones associated with each disease have been studied and 
identified with many of them having a proinflammatory role ( Funk et al., 2009;
Sato et al., 2018 ;Schori et al., 2018).
Blasiak et al., 2017 demonstrated the role of SASP in RPE cells, photoreceptors, and 
choriocapi[INVESTIGATOR_516300], RPE cells cannot be easily replaced 
by [CONTACT_516325], autophagy, photoreceptor 
degeneration, and eventually, vision loss.

UNITY Biotechnology, Inc Page 30 ConfidentialEvidence of SnCs in human retinopathies has focused on SASP and in vitro culture systems, 
but reports of p16+immunohistochemistry (IHC) and cell-type identification are limited.
Literature reports suggest presence of SnCs in aged primates ( Mishima et al., 1999), and the 
proliferation potential of human RPE cells in vitro is suggested to be influenced by [CONTACT_516326] 
(Flood et al., 1980). Recently, Lopez-Luppo et al., 2017 reported the presence of p16+cells in 
the retinal vasculature of aged human donors and vessels associated with microaneurysms.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining performed by [CONTACT_559935]/DME and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) indicates the presence 
of p16+cells ( Figure 2). When quantified and compared to age-matched normal tissue, a 
significant SnC burden was observed in both DR/DME and AMD globes.

This approach would address more effectively the multifactorial character of the disease and 
may decrease the proportion of patients that respond either poorly or partially to anti-VEGF, 
the need for repeated treatments, and the long-term complications like fibrosis and macular 
atrophy.

focused on the association of disease-relevant SASP to our senescent cellular and in vivo 
animal models. Elimination of SnCs by [CONTACT_516315]1325 may lead to a reduction in SASP by 
[CONTACT_559936], resulting in the restoration of homeostasis and retinal function. 
Human ocular cell types can be cultured and rendered senescent by a variety of different
insults, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging treatment (e.g., irradiation) and
disease-relevant conditions such as incubation in elevated glucose media. Human retinal 
microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC) upregulate the production of important mediators
such as VEGF and PDGF upon induction of senescence by [CONTACT_52004] ( Figure 3). As these 
molecules have been shown to be elevated in DR patients ( Ghodasra et al. 2016;
Klaassen et al., 2017), it stands to reason that senescent HRMEC in the retinas of patients 
may be the source of the elevated VEGF/PDGF that contribute to disease pathogenesis.

In a mouse model of retinal neovascularization (oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model),

[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacology
UBX1325 (pro-drug) and UBX0601 (active parent molecule) were studied in cellular and 
animal models of ocular disease to demonstrate activity in the retina. UBX1325 is a potent 
inhibitor of Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulatory proteins, which results in initiation of 
apoptosis in HRMEC, in vitro. In 2 different mouse models of retinal dysfunction, UBX1325 
demonstrated inhibition ofdisease-relevant endpoints such as neovascularization (NV) and 
vascular leakage.
[IP_ADDRESS] Toxicology 
UBX1325 has been evaluated in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) ocular toxicity studies in 
New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits and monkeys with observation periods of up to [ADDRESS_735981]-level (NOEL) following IVT injection in 
rabbits at which there were no findings was 5 µg/eye; the no-observed-adverse-effect-level 
(NOAEL) in monkeys was 25 µg/eye. In the systemic repeat-dose toxicity studies, NOAELs 
were 0.3 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg for rats and dogs, respectively. The systemic levels noted at 
these NOAELs (NOAEL = 0.3 mg/kg, C max = 1260 ng/mL and AUC last = 649 hr·ng/mL; 
NOAEL = 0.1 mg/kg, C max = 568 on Day 29; AUC could not be determined) are not
anticipated to be observed following IVT dosing. 
Cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and neurobehavioral safety pharmacology studies following IV 
dosing of UBX1325 up to 0.3 mg/kg UBX1325 did not result in any adverse findings. Of
note, the cardiovascular study in dogs did not show any effect on QT prolongation, consistent 
with in vitro results evaluating the effect of UBX1325 and UBX0601 on the human

previously been investigated in an ocular setting. 
UBX1325 was administered to patients with advanced DME and wet AMD in the Phase 1 
single ascending dose (SAD) study, UBX1325-01. UBX1325 was well tolerated with 
favorable safety profile supporting further development. As of November 9, 2021 there were 
a total of 14 adverse events unrelated to study drug. Of those 14, 4 were non-ocular, 
non-serious, non-drug related adverse events in 2 wet AMD patients (1 patient contracted 
COVID-19 and 1 patient had a tooth extraction, blister on gums and constipation). The 
remaining 10 ocular, non-serious, non-drug related adverse events occurred in 9 patients 
(2 DME and 7 wet AMD). Nine were study eye related (progression of disease in 8 patients, 
1 DME and 7 wet AMD) and 1 was non-study eye related (retinal detachment in 1 DME 
patient). There were no serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, inflammation, or AEs 
that would preclude advancement into later-stage clinical development.
The Sponsor is aware of the systemic toxicities associated with venetoclax, an 
FDA-approved oral Bcl-2 selective inhibitor for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small 
lymphocytic lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia. As a consequence of being in the same 
class of molecules, and in view of similar systemic toxicities noted in UBX1325 IV 
nonclinical studies, the Sponsor is planning to monitor for potential Bcl-2 inhibitor related 
toxicities (e.g., cytopenia) that may emerge from UBX1325 IVT treatment ( Section 7). 
However, based on currently available exposure data from nonclinical studies following IVT 
administration ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]), and the lack of measurable systemic exposure of UBX1325

efficacy in DME patients. 
Patients will be those diagnosed as having DME (as defined by [CONTACT_559938] 2019) with BCVA in the study eye of 73 to 20 ETDRS letters (equivalent to 
20/40 to 20/400 on the Snellen chart).
4.2.2 Dose Rationale 
The planned dose is 10 µg based on favorable safety data in the Phase 1 SAD study. As of 
November 9, 2021, in patients with advanced DME and wet AMD in the SAD Phase 1 study, 
UBX1325 was well tolerated with favorable safety profile supporting further clinical 
development; no dose-limiting toxicities in any of the dose cohorts, including the high dose . ble safety data in the Phase 1 SAD study. 
4.3 Recruitment
Approximately 62 patients are planned to enroll in this study. 
4.4 Definitions
Patients officially enter the Screening Period following provision of informed consent 
directly.
A screen failure is a consented patient who has been deemed ineligible on the basis of 1 or 
more eligibility criteria or who has withdrawn consent prior to randomization. Screen failures 
may be rescreened. Patients will be permitted to re-screen once, and in consultation with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.

7.1 Definitions
•AE: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans whether or not it is considered intervention related.
•Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R): A serious adverse reaction
(AR) that is unexpected based on current product information. 
•Serious adverse event (SAE) : An event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either
the Investigator or the Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
A life-threatening AE (An event is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an AE or suspected AR that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death) 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions A congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.•Causality or relatedness : AEs should be considered probably or possibly 
treatment-related, unless they fulfill the following criteria (in which circumstances it 
should be considered unlikely related or unrelated):
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the Study Drug (e.g., 
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication), and/or 
Clinical Study Protocol UBX1325-02
Protocol Amendment 4/Version 5.0
UNITY Biotechnology, Inc Page 55 ConfidentialThe AE has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the Study Drug
(e.g., a new cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_736016] dose of Study Drug). 
Relatedness to Study Drug will be graded as “probably,” “possibly,” “unlikely,” or 
“unrelated” as follows:
Probably related: The AE
Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration
Abates upon discontinuation of the drug
Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical
state
Possibly related: The AE
Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration
Could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_559946]: The AE
Is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_559947]: The AE
Does not follow a reasonable sequence from drug administration
Is readily explained by [CONTACT_559948]’s clinical state, concurrent medical conditions, or by [CONTACT_559949]
•AR: An AR is any AE caused by a drug. 
•Suspected adverse reaction (SAR): An SAR is any AE for which there is a reasonable
possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of the investigational new drug 
(IND) safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the AE. SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than AR.•Unexpected : An event is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the IB, is not listed at
the specificity or severity that has been observed, or, if an IB is not required or available, 
is not consistent with the risk information described in the General Investigational Plan or 
elsewhere in the IND. Unexpected also refers to events that are mentioned in the IB as
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of 
the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation. 
Clinical Study Protocol UBX1325-02
Protocol Amendment 4/Version 5.0
UNITY Biotechnology, Inc Page 56 Confidential•Severity or intensity: The severity of an event describes the degree of impact upon the 
patient and/or the need for medical care necessary to treat the event. AEs reported for
patients participating in this study will be graded using the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE v4.03). 
The Investigator will grade the severity of each AE using, when applicable, the NCI

UBX1325. The Investigator must follow up on all SAEs until the events have subsided, 
returned to Baseline, or,in case of permanent impairment, the condition stabilizes. 
7.2.2 Classification of Events
Although AEs should be based on the signs or symptoms detected during the physical 
examination and on the clinical evaluation of the patient, a specific diagnosis should be 
reported as the AE whenever feasible. In addition to the information obtained from those 
sources, the patient should be asked the following nonspecific question: “How have you been 
feeling since your last visit?” Signs and symptoms should be recorded using standard medical
terminology.

AEs will be coded using the MedDRA. Subjects with any AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_559953]. AEs will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_492780]. In addition, SAEs and 
discontinuations due to AEs will be summarized.
8.6.1 Exploratory Analysis
Additional exploratory analyses may be carried out to better inform interpretation of 
treatment effects depending on examination of the summary statistics originally planned as 
mentioned above and in the SAP.
8.6.2 Pharmacokinetics Analysis
Analysis of PK parameters will be based on the PK Analysis Set. PK of UBX1325 and 
UBX0601 in plasma following IVT injection of UBX1325 will be obtained at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Events effective through the Protocol Amendment Version 4.0.
Mean (SD) plasma concentrations of UBX1325 and/or UBX0601 will be summarized 
graphically and PK parameters will be estimated when data allow. Individual PK parameters 
(e.g., time at which the maximum concentration is observed [Tmax], maximum concentration 
observed [C max], area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to the last 
observed concentration [AUC 0-t], area under the plasma concentration-time curve
extrapolated to infinity [AUC 0-inf], percentage of area under the plasma concentration-time 
curve extrapolated after last observed concentration [AUC %extrap ], apparent total clearance of 
the drug from plasma after IVT injection [CL/F], apparent volume of distribution after 
non-intravenous administration [Vd/F], half-life [t 1/2]) will be calculated using 
non-compartmental analyses (NCA) when available data supports such calculations. 
Additional PK parameters may be derived, if deemed appropriate. Descriptive statistics will 
be used to characterize the inter-patient variability of the PK parameters by [CONTACT_9084]. 
Descriptive statistics will include patients per cohort, arithmetic mean, geometric mean, 
mean, median, standard deviation, %CV, value range (minimum and maximum), as

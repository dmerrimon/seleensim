1  Objective s 
1.1 Primary Objective:  
This is a prospective randomized control study to evaluate the feasibility of using a miniature (1.1 mm) 
cryoprobe to perform biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions using robotic bronchoscopy  
1.2 Secondary Objective:  
1. To assess safety of cry obiopsy through a robotic bronchoscope  
2. Comparison of sample size acquired  via cryobiopsy to routine forceps biopsy.  
3. Comparison of quality of sample for histologic diagnosis of malignant lung lesions between 
cryobiopsy to routine forceps biopsy . 
2 Background  
Lung nodules and masses may represent primary lung cancer, metastatic disease, infection, or more 
benign findings such as granuloma .  Often , lung nodules require biopsy to confirm  a diagnosis. 
Computerized tomography ( CT) guided lung biopsy is the gold standard technique .  Diagnostic rates  are 
90% or greater with excellent pathologic quality core biopsies. However, CT guided core lung biopsy is 
associated with a high pneumothorax rate  that may be as high as 20% (1). Because of this, there has  
been intense interest in bronchoscopic alternatives  to obtain biopsies while minimizing the risk of 
pneumothorax . Patients suspected of having lung cancer undergo  bronchoscopy for mediastinal staging 
with lymph node sampling .   Mayo Clinic has  acquired  the Ion Robot bronchoscopy system (Intuitive 
Surgical , Sunnyvale, CA, [LOCATION_003] ).  This system  uses a robotically driven 3.[ADDRESS_573325] biopsy with a pneumothorax rate less than 2%. However, these biopsy specimens often lack 
adequate tissue for both diagnosis and molecular adequacy  that can be  obtained with CT biopsy using 
core needles.  
Cryobiopsies are obtained with c ryoprobes which are  flexible catheters that can be passed through the 
channel of a bronchoscope.   R apid cooling  of tissue results from  the Joule -Thomson effect  which cases 
tissue to freeze and adhere to the probe. The biopsy is obtained by [CONTACT_449889]. This results in larger specimens with less crush artifact. This is a common technique 
used at centers around the world to obtain lung biopsies .  Mayo Clinic has significant published 
experience with this technique (1 -3). This technique has not been combined with robotic bronchoscopy 
due to size (both length and diameter) of older generation cryoprobes.  
Erbe Medical , (Marietta, GA, [LOCATION_003]) recently received FDA approval for a 1.1mm  disposable  cryoprobe , 
which will pass through the working channel of the Ion Robot ic bronchoscope . The goal of this study is 
to assess the feasibility of using t hat probe with the Ion Robot and evaluate  biopsy quality.

cryoprobe to perform biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions using robotic bronchoscopy  
Secondary Objectives :  
1. To assess safety of cryobiopsy through a robotic bronchoscope

6.1 Primary Endpoint:  
 
  Protocol ROBOCOP  
  December 15, [ADDRESS_573327] as adequate for further pathological analysis.  
6.2 Secondary Endpoints:  
Procedural:  
1. Duration of  each individual biopsy procedure from first insertion of probe into robotic 
sheath to removal of specimen. Duration of full procedure from first insertion of probe 
into robotic sheath to last removal of specimen.  
2. Freezing time (seconds) for cryoprobe biopsies  
3. Number of “successful” and “unsuccessful”  biopsy attempts . 
One attempt  is defined as insertion of the biopsy probe into th e robotic sheath, 
activation/ employment of the biopsy mechanism at the target site and retrieval via the 
robotic sheath. A biopsy attempt  is successful if a  tissue sample  that is considered by [CONTACT_449890][INVESTIGATOR_449881]. In the 
case of unsuccessful cryo biopsy attempts, it should be recorded whether tissue 
sampling was successful but the tissue sample was “lost” i.e. if a successful “bite”  took 
place as indicated by [CONTACT_449891], but the sample detached from 
the cryoprobe tip on its way out of the body and could not be recovered (e.g. because it 
was too big to fit thorough the over sheath or tissue channel or freezing was 
deactivated  too soon).  
 Histological:  
4. Histological  accessibility grade

epi[INVESTIGATOR_449883] 4 adverse event by [CONTACT_202156] 5.0 ) the study will be temporarily halted until the 
DSMB has reviewed the Adverse Events . The study will be continued if the event is demonstrably 
unrelated to the procedure or was a reasonable adverse event in relation to the research study 
procedure. The trial will be permanently halted for a grade 5 event (death) if attributable to the 
cryobiopsy procedu re. The study will be continued if the event is demonstrably unrelated to the 
procedure or was a reasonable adverse event in relation to the research study procedure.  
9 Study Plan:  
The proposed study will prospectively enroll patients being evaluated for robotic bronchoscopic lung 
nodule/mass biopsy which will be done as part of their standard medical care .   
1. Patients who present for robotic navigational bronchoscopy with planned biopsy of lung nodule 
or mass will be eligible to consent to be included in prospective study.  
2. Patients will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria  via review of medical history and 
standard of care pre -procedure examinations.  
3. Robotic  assisted  bronchoscopy will be performed as per institutional  standard of care . In 
addition to robotic shape sensing technology , radial probe ultrasound , fluoroscopy , and cone 
beam CT  may be used for navigation .  
4. The position of the navigation catheter relative to the nodule or mass will be confirmed via  
radial EBUS and c one beam CT.   
5. The lung nodule or mass will be biopsied using standard biopsy needles , ranging from [ADDRESS_573330] of 
care.  
6.  Per clinical practice, after the needle biopsy we will also take  tissue biopsies. We will take 3 
biopsies using the 1.1 mm Erbe cryoprobe and 3 biopsies using forceps.  The order in which the 
biopsy methods are employed will be randomized  1:1. In 50% of the patients, forceps will be

 followed by [CONTACT_449894]. In 50% of the patients cryoprobe will be followed by [CONTACT_449895]. 
Randomization will take place after needle biopsy, prior to tissue biopsy. Only patient s for which 
further tissue biopsy is deemed necessary following needle biopsy will be randomized. Remaining 
patients will be excluded from the study and will be treated according to the standard of care.  
See randomization procedure for details.   
7.  Cryoprobe and forceps biopsy will be performed according to standard of care and the device 
instructions for use. The initial freeze time for the cryobiopsy is 3 seconds as measured on the 
device timer. If inadequate tissue is obtained due to incomplete freeze, the freeze time can be 
extended by 1 second on each consecutive attempt (to a maximum of 8 seconds) at the 
discretion of the bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  
8.  Samples retrieved via forceps and cryoprobe biopsy will be placed into separate  formalin  
containers and forwarded to pathology  for sample processing and further pathological analysis  as 
per standard practice .  
9.  Patients will be followed up for adverse events until completion of  the standard of care post -
procedure follow -up within 2 weeks of the procedure.  The follow up may occur as a in person 
visit, video visit or telephone call .  Adverse events will be graded using CTCAE Version 5.0 and will 
be attributed using the following scale:  
 
[ADDRESS_573331] receive needle biopsy and rapid onsite evaluation followed by [CONTACT_102135] ( forceps 
and cryo -biopsy ). The order in which the  forceps and cryo -biopsy  methods are employed will be 
randomized 1:1. In 50% of the patients, forceps will be followed by [CONTACT_449894]. In 50% of the patients 

 
  Protocol ROBOCOP  
  December 15, [ADDRESS_573332] inter -procedurally; after 
needle biopsy and  prior to tissue biopsy. Only patient s for whom, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
further tissue biopsy is medically advisable,  will be randomized. Remaining patients will be excluded 
from the study and will be treated according to the standard of care.  See Figure 1 for the randomization 
schema.  
Sealed envelopes will be prepared at the beginning of the study using an independently managed (a 
research professional that is not a member of the study team) double -blinded envelope system . The 
double -blinded envelope will be opened  at the randomization time point (intra -procedurally  after needle 
biopsy and just prior to the tissue -biopsy ) to revel the order of methods (forceps/cryobiopsy) . If a 
further biopsy is not deemed necessary or medically advisable , the patient will be excluded from the 
study. The unopened randomization en velop will be replaced, and will  be used for the next eligible 
participant.  
Allocation will be double blinded to patient and bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_449884] -procedural randomization 
timepoint after which blinding of the bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_449885]. 
Pathologists interpreting the biopsy samples will be blinded to the biopsy device used although, due to 
the expected differences in biopsy size and appearance, the allocation of the biopsy method may be 
apparent. Unblinding will be performed in case of medical need or if required by [CONTACT_449896] l 
authorities.

Objective:  The objective of this study is  to investigate the potential efficacy and safety of vitamin 
A palmitate dosing in improving dark adaptation in participants with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) 
and abnormal dark adaptation. 
Study Population:  The first cohort consists of seven  participants with RPD who meet the 
eligibility criteria. The second cohort will consist of five participants with RP D who meet the 
eligibility criteria. Up to five additional participants may be accrued in the second cohort to account 
for participants who withdraw from the study prior to receiving two months of study 
supplementation for a reason unrelated to an adverse reaction . Up to 18  participants may be 
enrolled in this study.   
Design:  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], uncontrolled, prospective, single center study to investigate the  potential 
efficacy  and safety  of vitamin A palmitate dosing in improving dark adaptation in participants with 
RPD and abnormal dark adaptation. Participants in the first cohort were instructed to take 
16,[ADDRESS_894838] intake of vitamin A palmitate was greater than two months prior to their enrollme nt 
into Cohort 2.  
Outcome Measures:  For each cohort, the primary outcome is the measurement of dark adaptation 
parameters (thresholds and kinetics) by [CONTACT_270503]: dark adaptation times as measured by [CONTACT_662885] A pal mitate and dark adaptation parameters as 
measured by [CONTACT_662886] A palmitate supplementation. 
The primary outcome will be assessed at Month [ADDRESS_894839] cohort and Month 1 in the second 
cohort. For both cohorts, the secondary outcomes include changes in low luminance visual acuity 
(LLVA ) and changes in patient reported outcomes as measured by [CONTACT_662887] ( LLQ ). The secondary outcomes also include measurement of dark adaptation  
parameters (thresholds and kinetics) comparing baseline and one month after completing 
supplementation  (Month 3 in Cohort 1 and Month 2 in Cohort 2).

Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 2 1.0 INTRODUCTION /SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been the leading cause of central vision loss in 
people age [ADDRESS_894840] rod loss, has 
demonstrated impairments in eyes with non- advanced AMD compared to older eyes without AMD 
even when visual acuity varied little between severity groups11. Increasing AMD severity was 
associated with increased rod intercept time RIT, an outcome of dark adaptation, with eyes having 
reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) demonstrating the most significant delays11.    
Interpreting the data on dark adaptation across different phenotypes of macula, there are several possible hypotheses that have been proposed in the literature. A testable hypothesis proposed in 
the literature is that the sub retinal drusenoid deposits act as diffusion barriers for entry of sufficient 
vitamin A into the photoreceptors . This would lead to a local deficiency or 
a form  of nutritional 
deprivation at the level of the photore ceptor . Vitamin A deficiency has long been known to 
cause night blindness with rod dysfunction and while these patients are not deficient based on serum levels, there still could be a local deficiency at the level of photoreceptors. 
Without  available vitam in A (due to a serum deficiency or local deficiency) to combine with 
opsin, photoreceptors cannot regenerate functional visual pi[INVESTIGATOR_662875] a slowing of dark adaptation. 
 
A first step in understanding the  pathophysiology identified by [CONTACT_662888] A  palmitate . Restoration or 
improvement of visual function while on supplemental vitamin A palmitate would provide 
data to support this hypothesis in the setting of AMD . Jacobson et al15 tested this hypothesis 
in patients with Sorsby’s fundus dystrophy and demonstrated that vitamin A  palmitate  
DA VitA RP D September 6, 2023  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 3 supplementation could restore dark adaptation in these patients using 50,000 IU vitamin A 
palmitate for one month, but was also able to show maintenance of some (but not all) aspects of 
dark adaptation with 5,000 IU vitamin A palmitate15. Ayyagari and Sieving et al16 demonstrat ed 
that the dark adaptation of patients with late -onset retinal disease (LORD) with mutations in 
CTRP5 could be shifted with 15,[ADDRESS_894841]. Given the previously demonstrated efficacy of vitamin A palmitate 
supplementation in the treatment of Sorsby’s fundus dystrophy15 and eyes with early AMD17, the 
introduction of a second cohort that will take an increased dose of vitamin A palmitate (48,000 IU per day) in the DA VitA study is necessary since the data show that Cohort 1 did not present 
significant improvement in dark adaptation after taking 16,000 IU per day. The knowledge gained 
would provide further insights into pathogenesis of age- related macular degeneration.

TUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], uncontrolled, prospective, single center study to investigate the potential efficacy 
and safety of taking 16,000 IU (Cohort 1) or 48,000 IU (Cohort 2) of vitamin A palmitate  in 
improving the dark adaptation in  participants with RPD  and abnormal dark adaptation. 
4.1 Recruitment  
Participants will be recruited from the NEI clinic. Participants will be  initially  recruited from  the 
following protocols: the NEI screening protocol (08-EI-0102),  the NEI Ocular Natural History  
protocol (16-EI-0134), DA Extension (17- EI-0112), Rod Function (16- EI-0024), or DA_AMD 
(11-EI-0147). Eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_093]. The participants must have the 
presence of reticular pseudodrusen. Self-referral and referral from outside physicians will be 
permitted.  If any recruitment materials are utilized, IRB -approval will be obtained prior to 
distribution. The projected recruitment time for the five participants in the second cohort is 
approximately twelve  (12) months. 
DA VitA RP D September 6, [ADDRESS_894847] be conducted within a window of ± 14 days from the target day. At each visit, the participant 
will undergo a review of systems, such as assessment of headache frequency and severity, as well 
as an assessment of safety variables. The tests scheduled at each visit may be split and completed 
within seven  days (including the 7th day) from the visit date . A complete ophthalmologic 
examination will be pe rformed at each visit to measure outcome variables. Participants will be 
screened with serum for hepatitis or hepatic dysfunction. However, for caution, we will monitor 
liver function tests. If participants in either cohort cannot tolerate the prescribed d ose of vitamin A 
palmitate, they will be instructed to stop taking the supplement and they will be removed from the study.  
If participants are on Coumadin
® (Warfarin) at enrollment, they must visit their prescribing 
physician to check their Coumadin® status within two to four  weeks after initiating IP to have their

Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 4.4 Study and Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
4.4.1 Study Supplement Formulation 
The vitamin A palmitate supplement will be supplied as 8,000IU pi[INVESTIGATOR_662876] (USP) .   
4.4.[ADDRESS_894848] 80% of the total doses over the treatment period. The first cohort was instructed 
to take  two 8,000 IU pi[INVESTIGATOR_662877] (16,000 IU) with a meal.  The preliminary 
analysis of the data from the first cohort shows that 16,[ADDRESS_894849] cohort did not present significant improvement in dark 
adaptation after taking 16,000 IU of vitamin A palmitate per day. A higher  dose (50,000 IU) 
has been previously used in other studies of monogenic (inherited) retinal degeneration with 
good effect and good tolerance.
26, 27 It has even been e xplored in the context of individuals 
≥ 50 years old with AMD, albeit a different study design, but the  higher  dose of vitamin A 
was well -tolerated.28 Therefore, for the second cohort, administration of three 8,000 IU pi[INVESTIGATOR_662878] y (48,000 IU) and should be taken with a meal. The vitamin A 
palmitate  supplement should be stored at room temperature (15-30° C).  
4.4.[ADDRESS_894850] treatments 
administered for their conditions at the discretion of their treating physician, except for high-dose 
vitamin A  palmitate supplementation (≥ 8 ,000 IU per day). A participant will be withdrawn from 
the study i f placed on a daily dose of ≥ 8,000 IU of vitami n A palmitate.  
There are no pharmacologic interactions known to occur between vitamin A palmitate and 
tetracyclines, but there is the potential for additive side effects as each drug has the potential to 
cause intracranial hypertension. One case report in a patient receiving high doses of vitamin A 
palmitate combined with minocycline reported the development of benign intracranial hypertension.
24 For this reason, regular ophthalmic examinations during study visits is the

Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 recommended  care for participants r eceiving the drug combination. Specific questions regarding 
headaches and attention to optic nerve for presence of papi[INVESTIGATOR_662879].  
If participants are on Coumadin® at enrollment, they must visit their prescribing physician to chec k 
their Coumadin® status within two to four  weeks after initiating study supplementation to have 
their Coumadin® regimen adjusted if necessary (as taking  vitamin A  palmitate and Coumadin® can 
increase the chances of bruising and bleeding .) 
All participants  are eligible to receive standard -of-care treatment for RPD  while enrolled in this 
study. However, if a participant develops neovascular AMD in the study eye during the course of 
the study, the participant may receive standard -of-care treatment for neovascular AMD according 
to the recommendations of the participant’s treating retina specialist. The participant will be withdrawn from this study and the last observation will be carried forward for data analyses.

or the participant will continue to be seen at the NIH under another protocol, if available and the participant is eligible. The participants and their physicians, with written consent, will be informed 
of their  disease status during this study. Clinical data obtained during participation may be shared 
with the participants and with written permission from the participants , their private physicians. 
Results from the overall  study may  be shared once the study team has analyzed the data from all 
participants.  
DA VitA RP D September 6, 2023  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 4.6 Storage of Samples and Data 
No samples will be stored for this study. The clinical data will be stored in the NEI’s electronic 
medical record, the Clinical Research Infor mation System (CRIS)  and Emmes’  database. 
All individual data will remain confidential.  
Data may also be shared with collaborating laboratories at NIH or outside of NIH and/or submitted 
to NIH -designated repositories and databases if consent for sharing was obtained. 
Repositories receiving data from this protocol may be open- access or restricted access.  
Data will be stripped of identifiers and may be coded (“de -identified”) or unlinked from an 
identifying code (“anonymized”). When coded data is shared, the  key to the code will not be 
provided to collaborators, but will remain at NIH. Data may be shared with investigators and 
institutions with an FWA or operating under the Declaration of Helsinki (DoH) and reported at the 
time of continuing review. Sharing with investigators without an FWA or not operating under the 
DoH will be submitted for prospective IRB approval. Submissions to NIH -sponsored or supported 
databases and repositories will be reported at the time of continuing review. Submissions to non-NIH s ponsored or supported databases and repositories will be submitted for prospective IRB 
approval. 
Required approvals from the collaborating institutions will be obtained and materials will be 
shipped in accordance with NIH and federal regulations. 
5.0 R
ISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
There are risks associated with the procedures required for participants in this study. 
However,  these are all standard procedures that are performed as part of a normal eye and medical 
examination.  
Some of the discomforts associated with the ocular examination include the following: 
1. Dilating drops or anesthetic drops may sting. They can cause an allergic reaction, or if 
contaminated, can cause an infection, but neither of these problems is very likely to occur. 
Dilating drops can also cause a sudden increase of pressure (acute glaucoma) in eyes that 
are already predisposed to develop this condition. There is little risk of glaucoma being 
triggered in this way, but if it is, treatment is available. The participant’s intraocular 
DA VitA RP D September 6, [ADDRESS_894852] , color fundus photography and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging are 
non-invasive tests used to document and analyze retinal pathology and have no known 
medical risks.  
Possible risks and discomforts associated with non-ocular examinations include: 
1. Blood draws can cause discomfort and bleeding/bruising at the site of venous puncture. There is a remote risk o f fainting or local infection. If any of these conditions arise, they 
will be treated.  
2. The medical/ophthalmic history , questionnaires , and pregnancy tests  entail no medical risk.  
No additional risks or discomforts are expected for the other clinical procedures.  
3. There may be a risk to confidentiality. All precautions will be employ ed at the clinical sites 
and Coordinating Center. 
5.1 AdaptDx
TM Risks  
The dark adaptation protocol as outlined in Appendix 3 entails no medical risk. Other than the 
discomforts noted above regarding the dilating eye drops and bright flash of light, there may be 
fatigue and loss of motivation or attention due to the length of the procedure. There is no risk of 
photosensitivity associated with the AdaptDxTM. 
5.2 Medmont Dark Adapted Perimetry  
5.2.1 Kinetics of Dark Adaptation 
Eye drops will be used to dilate the pupil. Participants will view a background light in a Ganzfeld 
dome for five minutes. The intensity of the background light will vary and be calculated to bleach 
between 20 to 90% of rhodopsin. The background light will then be turned off and recovery of retinal sensitivity to Medmont blue and red stimuli will be measured. Sensitivity at each time point 
will be measured by [CONTACT_662889] a button when a blue or red light is  observed. 
DA VitA RP D September 6, [ADDRESS_894853] been explored previously in a 
similar population of patients with AMD with no sig nificant side effects.17 
High doses of vitamin A supplementation has also been administered in accordance with the World Heal
th Organization (WHO) guidelines to decrease childhood mortality.30 Some countries, such 
as South Africa, implemented a “routine periodic high - dose Vitamin A supplementation” program 
which provided six monthly high dose (100,000 IU to 200, 000 IU ) vitamin A retinyl palmitate 
capsules to  children without significant side effects.30  
There are small risks associated with chronic high -dose vitamin A toxicity.28 The effects of toxicity 
may include hepatomegaly, elevated blood lipid levels, bone changes, and increased intracranial pressure.

Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 A study investigating high dose vitamin A in molar pregnancy used 200,000 IU vitamin A in adult 
women for up to 60 days and found no significant toxic effects.31 Other studies show there may be 
a possible risk of teratogenicity in a fetus when a participant of childbearing potential consumes high doses (i.e., > 10,000 IU/day) of preformed vitamin A palmitate.

malformations in children when their mothers consumed high doses (>25,000 IU/day) of preformed  vitamin  A during pregnancy.

5.3.1 Drug Interaction -Related  
Vitamin A palmitate should be used in caution when combined with blood thinning medication. 
If par ticipants are on Coumadin® at enr ollment, they will be advised to visit their prescribing 
physician to check their  Coumadin® status within two to four  weeks after initiating the study 
supplement to have their Coumadin® regimen adjusted as necessary (as vitamin A palmitate and 
Coumadin® can increase the ch ances of bruising and bleeding.)

6.0 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
6.1 Research with Investigational Drugs 
This study is  being conducted under IND 138,192.  
6.2 AdaptDx and Medmont Dark Adaptation Devices 
On May 1, 2017, the IRB determined that the use of the AdaptDx and the Medmont dark adaptation 
perimeter devices meet the criteria for non -significant risk (NSR) devices under FDA guidelines 
(21 CFR 812.3(m)). These devices are/do not: 
1. Intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or 
welfare of a subject;  
2. Purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a subject;  
3. For a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk 
to the health, safety or welfare of a subjec t; or 
4. Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a subject.

9.1 Primary Outcome Analysis 
In this prospective, pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], analyses will be primarily descriptive and by [CONTACT_3445]. The study 
does not lend itself to a formal sample size calculation. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_662880] a given pa rticipant before and after vitamin A  
palmitate  supplementation. The number of participants with changes in dark adaptation parameters  
will be summarized . Changes in rod- intercept time on the AdaptDx will be calculated for each 
participant . Similarly,  pre-bleach thresholds and kinetic parameters will be compared before 
initiating  supplementation to after completing  supplementation for Cohort 1 (Month 2) and 
Cohort 2 (Month 1). 
9.2 Secondary Outcome Analysis 
Changes in LLVA and LLQ responses will be presented by [CONTACT_662898] 1 (Month 2) and 
Cohort 2 (Month 1) . In addition, LLVA and LLQ will be summarized from before initiating 
supplementation to one month after completing supplementation in Cohort 1 (Month 3) and 
Cohort 2 (Month 2).  The number of participants in the second cohort with changes in dark adaptation parameters one 
month after completing supplementation (Month 3 in Cohort 1 and Month 2 in Cohort 2) will be 
summarized and changes in rod- intercept time will be calculated for each participant. Pre -bleach 
thresholds and kinetic parameters will be compared before initiating supplementation to one month 
after completing supplementation (Month 3 in Cohort 1 and Month 2 in Cohort 2) . The outcomes 
will be monitored throughout the study period.

12.0 CONSENT DOCUMENTS AND PROCESS  
The informed consent document will be provided as a physical or electronic document to the 
participant or consent designee as applicable for review prior to consenting. A designated study 
investiga tor will carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the 
associated risks, discomfort and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time as is needed to review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with friends, 
family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study investigator. A signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to any research activities taking place. 
The initial consent process as well as re- consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms used in compliance with 
policy, including HRPP Policy 303) per discretion of the designated study investigator and with 
the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s). The remote consent option will allow the 
DA VitA RP D September 6, [ADDRESS_894858] will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and participant/consent designee, when in person) will be in a private 
area (e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is conducted remotely, the participant/consent 
designee will be informed of the private nature of the discussion and will be encouraged to relocate 
to a more private setting if needed. If the  consent process  is occurring remotely, parti cipants and 
investigators will view individual copi[INVESTIGATOR_267275]; the same screen may be used when both the investigator and the participant 
are co -located  but this is not required. 
Note: When required , the witness signature [CONTACT_547837]. 
Consent will be documented with required signatures on the physical document (which includes 
the printout of an  electronic document sent to the participant) or on the electronic document. 
The process for documenting signatures on an electronic document is described below. 
When a hand signature [CONTACT_486704], this 
study will use the following electronic platform to obtain the required signatures:  
• iMedConsent platform (which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant) 
Both the investigator and the participant will sign the electronic document using a finger, stylus or 
mouse. Electronic signatures (i.e., the “signature” and a timestamp  are digitally generated) will not 
be used.  
Study investigators with consenting privileges will obtain informed consent. All participants  will 
receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures 
and potential risks of the study. The participants  must have the ability to understand and sign an 
informed consent form, which must be signed prior to enrollment. The participants will have an opportunity to carefully review the consent and ask questions regarding this study prior to signing, 
and they will be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to themselves or benefits lost.

data collection, protocol monitoring, data analysis and reporting . The coordinating center provides 
routine monitoring of study participants’ data. Monitoring visits will occur on a schedule depending 
on the status of the study. More frequent monitoring visits will be performed at the beginning of the 
study when enrollment is open. Monitoring will decrease as enrollment closes and as participant 
follow -up continues .

DA VitA RP D September 6, [ADDRESS_894861] operating procedures 
(NEI  QA program and NEIS standard operating proc edures). These procedures cover the full 
protocol cycle beginning with staff credentialing and training, and protocol development and 
approval, through database development, data collection, monitoring and analysis, and finally manuscript preparation at the conclusion of the study. Data quality assurance is of the utmost 
importance to the NEI and Emmes . The two groups use a quality assurance system that relies on 
real-time data checks and reports t hroughout the course of a study to ensure the accuracy of 
information. This system is a secure and confidential data management system that stores data and 
provides quality assurance and reporting. Emmes  has developed a number of routine reports 
specifically designed for monitors (e.g., listings of serious adverse events , etc.).  Data will be 
reviewed for quality at least annually. 
Additionally, Emmes  has developed summary reports of discrepancies, as well as reports of the 
exceptions databases, which include requests and reasons for exceptions. The results of the reports 
are communicated back to site staff, and , along with protocol compliance issues, to the NEI SAE 
Review Committee  (if applicable) . 
Following the monitoring plan for this  study, Emmes  will perform monitoring activities, including 
on-site audits, review of database entries and the resolution of study issues. In addition to 
monitoring, Emmes  performs various detailed automated and manual data quality checks.

Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 APPENDIX 3: DARK ADAPTATION PROTOCOL  
Dark adaptation is the primary exposure of interest. R od-mediated dark adaptation will be 
measured with an AdaptDxTM dark adaptometer manufactured by [CONTACT_662899]. Participants will 
view the test target with their best optical correction for the test distance. To control for pupil size 
prior to dark adaptation testing, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_662883] ≥ 6 mm with 1% 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_143582] 2.5% phenylephrine hydr ochloride. Pupil size will be measured before each dark 
adaptation measurement to confirm adequate dilation. Based on prior studies of dark adaptation, it is expected that up to 5% of participants will be unable to adequately complete the test due to 
poor motivation or poor attention. Participants who are unable to complete the test will be 
considered withdrawals and additional participants may be accrued.   
The AdaptDx
TM provide the rod intercept time as a characterization of dark adaptation speed.  
The protocol for testing with a computer–automated dark adaptometer is described in detail in the 
User Manual s. Briefly, the dilated test eye is exposed to a standard photographic flash and the 
speed of visual sensitivity recovery in the dark is measured. Sensitivity recovery is measured by [CONTACT_662900] (least amount of light detected) about once per minute 
until recovery reaches a criterion sensitivity, typi[INVESTIGATOR_94954] 40 minutes or less. Sensitivity recovery 
is measured at 5˚ in the infe rior visual field on the vertical meridian. The test target is a 500 nm, 
2˚ diameter circular spot. Participants are given a [ADDRESS_894871] break between each measurement. 
The resulting recovery function is characterized by a measure of visual sensitivity recovery called 
the rod intercept. The rod intercept is the time in minutes at which the visual sensitivity recovery 
crosses the criterion sensitivity.

Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 APPENDIX 4: EVALUATION OF LIGHT  
Medmont Dark Adapted Chromatic (DAC) Perimeter 
The DAC perimeter uses blue and red LEDs and has been specifically designed to measure dark 
adapted retinal sensitivity. Sensitivity is calculated from the inverse of light thresholds. Due to the 
sensitivity of dark adapted photoreceptors, light thresholds are extremely low (ca. 10-5 cd/m2). 
Therefore, maximum light intensity of the blue and red LEDs is quite low (ca. 10 cd/m2) so that 
photoreceptor thresholds can be achieved at maximum attenuation of the LEDs. By  [CONTACT_2163] a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_662884] (e.g. Humphrey or Octopus) used in the eye clinic has a maximum intensity of 3200 cd/m
2. As such, the light intensities used by [CONTACT_662901] [ADDRESS_894872] to the patient .  
 Light Intensity for Rhodopsin Bleaching  
We are proposing to bleach 20% to 90% of retinal rhodopsin by [CONTACT_662902] a background light from 210 to 4250 cd/m
[ADDRESS_894873] 40% lower than the 7000 cd/m2 used by [CONTACT_662903]-field dark adaptometer (Roland Consult, [LOCATION_013]) which the patient also views for five  
minutes. In addition , the maximum background light level we are proposing is only 14% of the 
light level ( 30 000 cd/m2) used by [CONTACT_662904].15 The background intensities we 
are proposing are 40% -85% lower than used previously and as such do not represent a light hazard 
to the patient.  
Procedures:  
1. The participant is placed in the dark for 30 minutes. 
2. Sensitivities on the Medmont perimeter are tes ted to obtain level of “pre -bleach” 
sensitivities.  
3. Participant is asked to view a background light from 210 to 4250 cd/m2 respectively for 
five minutes.  
4. Sensitivities at various locations in the macula are tested using the Medmont perimeter over a time frame not to exceed 60 minutes.

PROTOCOL MDACC 2014-0548 
CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection September 9, [ADDRESS_1131651] udy is to be conducted 
according to [LOCATION_002] and int ernational standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA 
Title 21 parts 11, 50, 54, 56, 312, International Conference on  Harmonization and the 
Declaration of Helsi nki), applicable government regulations and  Institutional research 
policies and procedures. 
2.0 Background Information 
2.1 Acute Myeloid Leukemia in the Elderly and its Treatment 
Acute myeloid leukemia repres ents a group of clonal hematopoiet ic stem cell disorders in 
which both failure to differentiate and excessive proliferation  in the stem cell 
compartment result in accumul ation of non-functional cells term ed myeloblasts.(1) 
 
Untreated AML in all ages is rap idly fatal, with patients dying  on average within a few 
months of diagnosis.  Even with t reatment, particular groups of  AML patients continue to 
have a poor prognosis.  AML in the elderly (age ≥ 60) is associated with increased risk of 
not responding to therapy and increased risk of dying from the treatment.  Appelbaum, et 
al.(2) and Kantarjian, et al.(3) summarize the factors that c ontribute to poor outcomes in 
elderly patients with AML. Risk f actors that decrease patient t olerance to therapy or 
sensitivity of the leukemia to t herapy include increasing age, poor performance status, co-
morbid medical conditions, accumulated chromosomal abnormalitie s, adverse mutations, 
and multi-drug resistance.  There is broad overlap of these risk factors with most elderly AML patients having one or 
more adverse features.  The poor r esults of treatment in elderly AML lead to a reluctance 
to treat elderly patients with i ntensive regimens designed to induce aplasia and complete 
remission.  Clearing the marrow of leukemia  has historically been the only means of obtaining 
prolonged survival in AML patient s.  This is usually accomplish ed by [CONTACT_817326]/cytoreductive therapy.
(4)  The intensity of treatment  needed to induce aplasia 
and complete remission is associated with early mortality rates  of 10-20% in elderly 
patients considered fit for int ensive therapy and is higher in patients with risk factors 
indicating less sensitive leukemia, co-morbidities, and poor pe rformance status.(2, 3, 5-7) 
 A randomized study reported i n 2009 showed that a double induction regimen with 90 
mg/m
2 daunorubicin with cytarabine (f irst induction) followed by a second induction 
with intermediate do se cytarabine (1 g/m2) could be safely administered with high rates 
of complete remission in older  patients. The second induction w as given even to patients 
already morphologically leukemia- free after first induction, a practice that is not routinely 
used in the U. S. and Canada.  This publication from the HOVON group noted 
improvement in remission rate wh en compared to a traditional regimen of cytarabine plus 
daunorubicin (45 mg/m2) but no improvement in disease-fr ee survival or overall surviv al 
PROTOCOL MDACC 2014-0548 
CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection September 9, 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 61 FINAL was noted.(8)  At the present time, the HOVON study has not bee n replicated in elderly 
patients by [CONTACT_817327].  
 Another study by [CONTACT_201913], et al., reported success for the sa me higher dose 
daunorubicin regimen (90 mg/m
2) versus 45 mg/m2 of daunorubicin when used for first 
induction for younger patients.(9) For second inductions, the dose of daunorubicin was 
reduced to 45 mg/m2 for all patients.  Responding patie nts were taken to transplan t.  
Neither this study nor the HOVO N study used daunorubicin 90 mg/ m2 for second 
induction courses or in consolid ation and neither study demonst rated that 90 mg/m2 is 
more effective than 60 mg/m2.  Although of great interest, neith er regimen is ready to be 
used as the control arm in a comparative study with CPX-351.  For patients at high risk of relapse (e.g. those with high-risk  cytogenetics, underlying 
MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantat ion is usually 
recommended if the patient is able to tolerate a transplant and  has a suitable donor. 
 For patients with older age or c o-morbidities the risk of induc tion treatment remains high.  
Patients age [ADDRESS_1131652] 3+[ADDRESS_1131653] an induction mortality rate of 20%.(8, 10) Those with a dverse cytogenetic 
abnormalities have a significantly higher risk of early mortali ty.(8, 11) At MD Anderson, 
patients at relatively high ( 30-50%) risk for induction mortali ty (60-day) can be 
identified.  Patients in this ag e group with adverse cytogeneti c abnormalities have an 
early mortality rate of 35% com pared to 22% for those in the same age group with 
diploid cytogenetics (Tambar o et al. ASH 2012). In addition, an  analysis of 998 patients 
age 65 or older with AML or high-ri sk MDS analyzed the factors associated with 
increased risk for early morta lity and, consequently, poor long -term outcome. By 
[CONTACT_104795], age 75 years or older, performance status ≥2, complex karyotype, treatment outside a laminar ai r-flow setting, antecedent hemato logic disorder of at least 
12 months duration prior to the d iagnosis of AML, and a creatin ine >1.3 mg/dL were 
identified as independent factors associated with increased ris k of mortality by 8-weeks 
from the start of induction chemotherapy.
(3) Patients with none of these risk factors have 
an 8-week mortality probability of 10%, with a median survival of 16 months and 1-year 
projected survival of 58% and are considered a low-risk group. In contrast, for those with 
1 or 2 risk factors (i.e., the in termediate risk group) the 8-w eek mortality rate is 19-36% 
with median survival of 4-9 months and 1-year survival rates of  22-35%. Those with 3 or 
more risk factors (the high-risk group) have a 65% probability of early mortality, median survival of 1 month and 1 year pr ojected survival of 8%.
(3) For patients with intermediate 
or high risk the decision to treat  with intensive chemotherapy is difficult because the 
benefits have been approximatel y equal to the risks.  Studies u sing non-intensive 
treatment have been performed indi cating reduced early risk wit h reduced benefit.  The 
need for effective treatment w ith acceptable treatment safety r emains urgent.   
 
2.2 CombiPlex Technology 
In vitro studies have shown that antitumor activity can be enha nced when cytotoxic drugs 
are used in combination.  This ha s led to cytotoxic drug combin ations as standard therapy 
PROTOCOL MDACC 2014-0548 
CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection September 9, [ADDRESS_1131654] ug combinations 
providing synergy at one ratio may be simply additive or even a ntagonistic at other 
ratios.(12)  When individual free  drugs are administered, each agent is handled 
differently by [CONTACT_10489], resulting in differences in the distri bution and elimination of the 
individual drugs to tumor sites  which must result in drug ratio s that are sometimes 
suboptimal or ineffective.  The  manufacturer’s technology is ba sed on findings that in 
vitro  synergistic activity of antine oplastic drugs depends on specif ic drug ratios and that 
the in vivo activity of  a combination depe nds on maintaining th e synergistic ratio.  In this 
way, the development of a particular chemotherapeutic regimen can be based on the most 
efficacious ratio rather than empi[INVESTIGATOR_607756].  The development of CPX-351 (cytara bine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection was based 
on 1) defining a synergistic ratio of  the two active moieties, cytarabine and daunorubicin, 
using cell-based screening assays and 2) designing a liposomal drug carrier to maintain 
this ratio after intravenous administration.  This ratio was not based on the empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-derived, toxicity-guided regimens  currently used for cytarabine  and anthracyclines. 
 
2.3 Physical, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Information 
CPX-351 is a liposomal formulati on of a fixed combination of th e antineoplastic drugs 
cytarabine and daunorubicin. The t wo drugs are present inside the liposome in a 5:1 
molar ratio.  The liposome memb rane is composed of distearoylph osphatidylcholine, 
distearoylphosphatidylglycerol  and cholesterol in a 7:2:[ADDRESS_1131655] a nominal diameter of approximately 100nm and are suspende d in sucrose.  
Sterilization is achieved by [CONTACT_607775] a 0.22 µm filte r. 
 
CPX-351 is provided as a steril e, pyrogen-free lyophilized form ulation in 50 ml glass, 
single-use vials.  Each vial contains 100 units of CPX-351 wher e each unit contains 1.0 
mg cytarabine and 0.44 mg daunorubicin base in liposomes.  The lyophilized cake is 
reconstituted with water for injection to obtain a homogeneous dispersion at 5 units/mL.  
The composition of the formulation after reconstitution is list ed in Table 1 below.

The dosage regimen was designed to mimic the 7-day drug exposur e provided by 
[CONTACT_22518] 7+3 treatment.   A s ingle induction course adminis ters doses on Days 1, 3, 
and 5, by 90 minute infusion.  Patients with AML (multiply rela psed, refractory, or with 
first CR duration of 6 months or less), ALL, and high risk MDS were eligible. 
 
Dose limiting toxicities were obs erved at the 10th dose level: 134 u/m2 (134 mg/m2 
cytarabine + 59 mg/m2 daunorubicin).  One patient had significant reduction in post 
treatment LVEF and as a result both Phase II studies included a  cap (500 mg/m2) on 
cumulative anthracycline dose after one induction course of CPX -351 and patients with 
significant pre-existing cardiac  disease were excluded.  Other dose-limiting toxicities 
included hypertensive crisis a nd prolonged (>56 days) cytopenias.

Three of the 48 patients enteri ng the study had ALL and a trans ient CR was achieved in 
one patient at the 43 unit/m2 dose level.  Two patients with h igh risk MDS were treated at 
lower dose levels and neither responded. The remaining 43 patie nts had AML; [ADDRESS_1131660] and b ecause of the low frequency o f non-hematological

day 1, 3 and 5 induction course of t reatment and confirmed persistence of the 5:1 molar 
ratio for up to 24 hours in the plas ma with markedly prolonged median half-life for both

2.6.2 Phase II Study of CPX-351: CLTR0308-[ADDRESS_1131661] 7+3, in newly diagnosed, ol der (age 60-75) patients with AML.  The comparison 
of encapsulated cytarabine and daunorubicin (CPX-351) versus free cytarabine and 
daunorubicin (7+3) would be fully interpretable for relative ef ficacy and safety and 
would begin to provide evidence supporting or refuting the hypo thesis that dosing based 
on molar ratios would lead to improved efficacy.

One hundred twenty-seven patients were randomized from 18 of 28 study sites. The study was amended to extend follow-up to 2 years when it became apparent that 1 year follow-up would be insufficient to captu re median survival in both study groups. 
 
A two to one randomization was used to maximize experience usin g CPX-351.  Response 
rate (CR+CRi) was the primary endpoint and superior response wi th a one-sided p-value 
of <0.[ADDRESS_1131662] in development . Secondary endpoints 
were overall survival, event-fr ee survival, CR+CRi duration, ra te of aplasia, safety and 
practicality of CPX-351 as consol idation therapy and the respon se rate of CPX-351 
between de novo and secondary AML. 
 
 
 At entry patients were stratified by [CONTACT_654] (60-69 vs. 70-75), cyt ogenetics (< or ≥3 
cytogenetic abnormalities), and type of AML (de novo vs. second ary).  High risk patients 
were older (age 70-75) or had complex cytogenetics (≥3 cytogene tic abnormalities) or 
had secondary AML.  Standard risk patients were younger (age 60 -69), had non-complex 
cytogenetics (<3 abnormalities) and had de novo AML.  After accrual was complete, [CONTACT_56654] (H.L. Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL) reviewed  all of the cytogenetic 
reports and confirmed/corrected assignment of patients to <3 or  ≥3 cytogenetic 
abnormalities.  In addition he also assigned each patient to a specific cytogenetic risk group (adverse vs. intermediate vs. unknown) according to Natio nal Comprehensive

Survival (EFS, based on documentation of persistent leukemia, r elapse after CR, or 
death) and Overall Survival (OS) demonstrated non-significant improvements for CPX-
351 in the overall study populat ion and the high risk populatio n.  K-M analysis of the 
secondary AML population (includi ng treatment-related AML and A ML occurring in the 
setting of antecedent hematologic disorders, e.g. myelodysplasi a, myeloproliferative 
disease, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) showed a significant improvement in overall survival (p-value=0.01) with a median survival improvem ent of 6 months (12.1 
vs. 6.1 months).  The overall sur vival and event-free survival curves shown in Figure 2 
through Figure 4 include crossover patients in the Control Arm based on their original treatment assignment.  This conf ounds the interpretation of OS,  but as the patients are 
considered as having an event a t crossover, this confounding is  not present in the EFS 
curves.  Given the number of EFS events, the EFS curves are rel atively mature.  The OS 
curves, with only about 50% of the events, are less mature.

Adverse events were qualitativel y similar between both study ar ms.  Adverse events with 
increased frequency in the CPX- 351 arm were linked to greater myelosuppression with 
higher rates of febrile neutropenia (63.5% vs. 51.2%), bacterem ia (42.4% vs. 22%), 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (36.5% vs. 19.5%), and petechiae (32.9% vs. 12.2%).  This appears to be due to 
more prolonged myelosuppression (median ANC recovery to ≥1000/ L: 36 vs. 29 days 
and median platelet recovery to ≥100,000/ L: 37 vs. 27 days).  Serious fungal infections 
were more frequent on CPX-351 versus 7+3.  These tended to occu r during the period of 
nadir neutropenia and resolved a t recovery. There were no grade [ADDRESS_1131666], including cough, rash, and headache were usually of grade 1-2 severity and were transient.  The key safety findings were that CPX-351 had lower than expected 60-day mortality (4.7% vs. 14.6%), lower rates of adverse events with grade 5 outcome (11.8 vs. 17.1),   and more prolonged myelosuppression with higher rates of febri le neutropenia, 
infections and bleeding events but no increase in deaths associ ated with infection when 
compared to 7+3.  Non-myelosuppressive adverse events were simi lar in quality in both 
study arms and there was no evidence of excess cardiac events, in this group of

2.6.3 Phase II Study of CPX-351: CLTR0308-205 
This study compared CPX-351 (100u/m2; Day 1, 3, 5) with salvage therapy in first 
relapse AML patients.  This t rial planned to accrue 120 patient s with a 2:1 randomization.  
Investigator choice of control s alvage regimen was expected to be between (1) high dose 
cytarabine with or without daunorub icin, (2) 7+3 or (3) mitoxan trone, etoposide and 
cytarabine.  The allowance of investigator’s choice reflects th e fact that no single salvage 
therapy is superior and the necessity of individualizing treatm ent.  Responding patients 
were expected to receive allogene ic stem cell transplant for co nsolidation if donors were 
available. 
 The European Prognostic Index w as used to stratify patients.  F or this trial, the primary 
endpoint was survival at one year, which for the control arm wa s expected to be 30% 
based on previous clinical trials and the literature.  Secondary endpoints were CR+CRi rate, remission duration, event- free survival and 30/60/[ADDRESS_1131669] 
complete remission, cytogenetics , and age.  There was a slight imbalance in history of 
prior stem cell transplants w ith more patients in the CPX-351 arm having a history of

2.7 Copper Background 
Copper is an essential element that is a component of a number of metalloenzymes acting 
as oxidases (e.g. diamine oxidase , monoamine oxidase, cytochrom e c oxidase).  The 
median absorption of copper fr om food (by [CONTACT_817328]) is  1.0 to 1.6 mg/day.  The 
tolerable Upper Intake Level  for adults is 10 mg/day.  At a dos e of CPX-351 of 100 u/m
2, 
a patient with a BSA of 2.[ADDRESS_1131673] dose (see Figure 5).  N o toxicity seen in animal studies was attributa ble to copper. 
 
The data from the clinical studi es are consistent with the prec linical findings.  Since 
CPX-351 contains copper (0.18 mg coppe r per unit, in the form o f copper gluconate), 
serum total copper levels were monitored in the Phase 1 clinica l study (Study 
CLTR0305-101).  Figure 5 shows this data for cohort 9 (n=20, do se 101 units/m2) 
graphically:  
PROTOCOL MDACC 2014-0548

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 61 FINAL Figure 5:  Median and Mean Serum Copper in Cohort [ADDRESS_1131674] Induction 
 
 
 
As Figure 5 shows, both the median and mean copper levels in pa tients receiving 3 doses 
of CPX-351 at 101 units/m2 was very high on day 7 ([ADDRESS_1131675] dose) but 
returned to normal levels in most patients by [CONTACT_4475] 14.  All pati ents had serum copper 
levels in the normal range by [CONTACT_395789] y [ADDRESS_1131676] induction.   In summary, no safety 
problems are expected due to sy stemic copper exposure from CPX- 351. 
 In this trial, serum copper levels will be monitored and elevat ed levels are assumed to be 
due to copper gluconate encapsulated within the CPX-351 liposom e rather than free 
circulating copper.  Clinical observation from a single patient treated with the identical copper-containing liposome encapsulating a different chemothera py doublet (CPX-1, 
floxuridine and irinotecan) dem onstrated sustained elevations o f copper in a patient 
during a period of biliary obstruction, with return to baseline levels after stenting relieved the obstruction.  This anecdote suggests that copper eliminatio n after CPX-351 is likely 
via biliary excretion and elimination in the feces.  Preclinica l studies completed by 
[CONTACT_817329] (acquired by [CONTACT_156239]) demonstrated that vi rtually all of the copper 
administered in the form of CPX- 351 is excreted via the feces w ithin approximately 2 
weeks of administration.  It is expected that eligible patients  with unobstructed biliary 
systems should be able to eliminate the copper administered wit hin a few weeks.  Serum 
copper levels will be monitored until they return to baseline l evels (±20%) and patients 
will be monitored for hepatic dysfunction, a common manifestati on of copper-related 
toxicity.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 61 FINAL 3.0 Study Objectives and Rationale 
3.1 Primary Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to assess preliminary ef ficacy (as determined by [CONTACT_817330])  of two or three dose levels of C PX-351 in patients with newly 
diagnosed AML at high risk for  induction mortality, defined as 30-50% predicted risk of 
death by [CONTACT_2006] 60, and to select the m ost promising dose level fo r further efficacy testing.  
Estimation of risk for induction mortality at patient screening  will be based on factors 
associated with lower likeli hood of AML response with or withou t factors that reduce 
tolerance to treatment-ass ociated adverse events.   
 
3.2 Secondary Objectives 
To confirm the rate of dose limiting toxicities, including indu ction mortality (at day 60) 
for two different sub-MTD dose levels (50 and 75 U/m2).  If safety results suggest 
feasibility to test the MTD dose level of CPX-351 (100 U/m2) in patients believed to be at 
high risk for induction mortality, the rate of dose limiting to xicities and induction 
mortality will be teste d in this group as well.

The Phase I study identified the  MTD in fit relapsed and refractory adult leukemia 
patients and confirmed that the intended 5:1 molar ratio was ma intained for 
cytarabine:daunorubicin across mu ltiple dose levels with marked ly prolonged plasma half 
life of cytarabine and daunorubi cin.  At the MTD, CPX-[ADDRESS_1131680] dose (Study Day 12).  A substantial number of responses were 
observed among late stage patien ts already previo usly treated w ith cytarabine and 
daunorubicin.    The randomized Phase II results w ith CPX-[ADDRESS_1131681] that CPX-3 51 is likely better 
tolerated than conventional cy tarabine and daunorubicin-based c hemotherapy with 
reduced 60-day mortality (4.6%) observed among newly diagnosed patients.  Moreover, 
preclinical observations that CPX-351 concentrates in bone marrow with evidence for 
relatively selective in ternalization of liposomes within the cy toplasm of leukemia cells 
PROTOCOL MDACC 2014-0548 
CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection September 9, [ADDRESS_1131682] to one half the MTD (32 to 43 u nits/m2), strongly suggest 
that 25% and 50% dose reductions to 75 and 50 units/m2 will still be effective and should 
be better tolerated.  By [CONTACT_817331]-351 as induction therapy it may be 
possible to improve the outcome of patients with AML considered  at high risk for 60-day 
mortality, patients not ordinarily offered induction therapy fo r AML at all.   
 
Data from the Phase I and both Pha se II studies also demonstrated a relatively shallow 
dose/toxicity curve, with rela tively little increase in non-hem atopoietic toxicities with 
increasing doses up to the MTD.  If sub-MTD dose levels of CPX- [ADDRESS_1131683] efficacious dose lev el in patients at high 
risk for induction mortality.   
4.0 Study Design 
One cycle equals 28 days.  This study is an open-label, two -arm or possibly 3-arm, phase I I trial.   CPX-351 is 
administered as approximately a 90-minute infusion on days 1, 3 , and 5 with one study 
arm receiving 50 units/m
2 and the other receiving 75 units/m2.   Both the 50 and the 75 
unit/m2 dose levels are considered to have acceptable safety based on observations from a 
pair of randomized Phase II st udies conducted in adult patients , where the observed 60-
day mortality results in patients considered fit for intensive chemotherapy and with no 
prior history of stem cell tran splant, was observed to be reduc ed compared to control.   
 Patients with newly diagnosed A ML who are predicted to be at hi gh risk (30-50%) for 
induction mortality (death by [CONTACT_4475] 60) are eligible.  Every pati ent entered must have at 
least one AML-related factor (ad verse cytogenetics, secondary A ML, MDR phenotype, 
etc.) that contributes to elev ated risk of induction mortality.   Patients may or may not 
have patient-related factors (poor performance status, co-morbi dities, poor organ 
function, etc.) that also contribu te to elevated risk of induction mortality. 30 patients will 
be randomized with a 1:1 rati o to the two dose arms with 15 pat ients per arm to assess for 
safety and efficacy.  If safety is  demonstrated for both of the  sub-MTD dose levels, and 
escalation is deemed f easible above 75 units/m
2, a cohort of 15 patients will be studied at 
100 units/m2, the MTD dose level. The latter dose (i.e., 100 units/m2) was found safe and 
an additional 25 patients will be enrolled at this dose (for a total of 40 evaluable patients) 
to define efficacy at this standard dose.  At the end of the study a single  dose level will be confirmed to have acceptable safety if 
the observed rate of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is <5 DLT/15 patients.<33%).  Dose 
limiting toxicity is defined as induction mortality (death occu rring during the first 60 
days from start of study therapy), grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity, or dose limiting 
PROTOCOL MDACC 2014-0548 
CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection September 9, [ADDRESS_1131684] udy therapy (i.e., during the first  cycle of therapy).   
 
For non-hematologic toxicity the  following are counted as dose limiting toxicities only 
under the conditions noted: 
 Liver toxicity: Grade 4, relat ed to the study drug, not resolving to grade 2 within 7 
days.  
 Decrease in ejection fraction: G rade ≥3 (nadir LVEF <40-20%), r elated to study 
drug 
 Creatinine elevation:  Gra de ≥3, related to study drug. 
 Any other adverse event of Gra de ≥3, related to study drug that  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_817306].  
 
Dose limiting hematologic toxicity is defined by [CONTACT_817332] d peripheral blood 
examination at Day >56 showing: 
 Absence of recurrent or persistent leukemia AND 
 Persistently hypocellular marrow (<20% cellularity) AND 
 Peripheral blood: 
o ANC< 500 and/or 
o Platelet count <10,000 
 
If more than one dose level is c onsidered acceptably  safe, the  decision about which one 
to use for future clinical study will be based on efficacy.  Ef ficacy success for an 
individual patient is defined a s achievement of CR or CRi.  Observation of <3 CR or CRi 
among 15 patients (<20%) define s a non-efficacious study arm.  In situations where both 
study arms are considered equally safe, the study arm with the higher rate of response 
will be recommended for future study, provided it equals or exc eeds 20%.   
When the dose recommended for f uture study is defined, 10 addit ional newly diagnosed 
patients will be treated at that  dose level (not to exceed a to tal of 25 patients at that dose 
level) to obtain additional evidence of safety and efficacy amo ng previously untreated 
patients with high risk of induction mortality.   
 
4.1 Patient Recruitment 
All patients will be screened by a  principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_710794] b-investigator prior to entry 
on the study.  An explanation of  the study and discussion of th e expected risks and 
benefits will be fully discussed with patients prior to the scr eening process in order for 
the patient to provide a voluntar y written informed consent.  O nly eligible and consenting 
patients will be entered into the study. 
 
4.2 Registration Procedures 
Patients will be registered through CORe.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 61 FINAL 4.3 Patient Sample Size 
A maximum of 80 patients will be treated. 
 A minimum of 15 patients will be treated at each dose level, un less 
conditions for early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_817307] (see section 10.0).  
 
4.4 Toxicity Assessment 
Toxicities will be evaluated and graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4 (CTCAE).  If a patient is discontinued due t o progressive disease or inte rcurrent illness unrelated to 
toxicity attributable to CPX- 351 and before safety can be asses sed to rule out DLT, an 
additional patient will be recru ited, to ensure that the minimu m number of patients are 
evaluable for safety at each dose level. 
4.5 Second Inductions 
A second induction may be given if: 
 The first induction does not produce a day 28 bone marrow demon strating 
morphologic leukemia free state (≤5% blasts)  
 Second inductions are given at the discretion of the investigator but are 
recommended in any patient with documentation of reduced leukem ic burden, 
especially those with evidence  of partial remission (≥50% reduc tion in % blasts 
count to 5-25% blasts).  
 Second induction may be started on Day [ADDRESS_1131685] cycle.  In patients with 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_185964] s econd induction may be started e arlier (but not 
earlier than Day 21) provided t here is no residual study drug-related grade [ADDRESS_1131686] igator.  
 
The CPX-351 dose for second induction is the same as for initia l induction except that 
doses are given on Days 1 and 3 only.  Patients unable to achieve a response (CR+CRi) after two inductions are disconti nued from further treatment an d are followed for survival 
only. 
 
4.6 Consolidation Therapy 
Only patients with documented res ponse (CR or CRi) are eligible  for consolidation.  
Consolidation with stem cell transplant (HSCT) is permitted eit her in place of 
chemotherapy consolidation or aft er chemotherapy consolidation.   Prior to beginning 
every other chemotherapy consolid ation after the cumulative DNR  dose exceeds 300 
mg/m
2,or  prior to every course of treatment after the cumulative DNR dose exceeds 500 
mg/m2, patient LVEF must be documented t o be ≥50% and patient PS must be 0-2.

A maximum of 4 courses of conso lidation will be administered. I t is understood that 
variations in timing of second induction and consolidations may  be necessary and will be 
decided on a case by [CONTACT_185116]. The rationale for variations in schedule will be 
documented by [CONTACT_978].  If consolid ation is well tolerated and h ematopoietic recovery is 
not delayed beyond 56 days, additional courses of consolidation  may be offered 
immediately at time of recover y.  In cases of poor patient tolerance or delayed 
hematopoietic recovery, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_817308] t his decision to either 
continue or terminate co nsolidation treatment.

Induction doses are not reduce d.  Consolidation doses are 65 units/m2 on days 1 and 3.  In 
instances with prolonged myelos uppression or other medical cond itions where the 
investigator feels further dose reduction might be required, 50  units/m2 on days 1 and 3 
may be used after discussion wit h PI [INVESTIGATOR_817315].  
Patients with evidence of delayed recovery from cytopenias or a cute toxicities following 
induction or consolidation (>56 days) may have consolidation do ses delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 
weeks to permit recovery.   Any doses missed or delayed due to toxicity may be 
administered as soon as the pati ent has recovered from the toxi city.  Toxicities will be 
graded using the CTCAE Version 4. 0 (See APPENDIX 5: Common Term inology 
Criteria for Adverse Events V4.0 (CTCAE)).   
7.4 Concomitant Therapy 
7.4.1 Premedication 
Nausea and vomiting: 
Patients may receive prophylaxis or therapy for nausea and/or vomiting according to 
institutional standards.  Hypersensitivity/Infus ion-related reactions: 
Patients will not be routinely pr e-medicated for hypersensitivi ty or infusion-related 
reactions initially during the fi rst infusion of the first trea tment course.  If the patient 
develops a hypersensitivity r eaction then he/she should be pre- medicated at all 
subsequent infusions.  
7.4.2 Suggested guidelines for management of hypersensitivity reactions: 
 
Mild symptoms (e.g., mild f lushing, rash, pruritus): 
Stop infusion and supervise at be dside with monitoring of vital  signs 
Reinitiate infusion slowly (halv ing the rate of infusion) +/- p remedication 
 Moderate symptoms (e.g. moderate rash, flushing, mild dyspnea, chest discomfort): 
Stop infusion and give IV diphenhydr amine, 20-25 mg (or equival ent) and IV 
dexamethasone 10 mg. 
Do not reinitiate infusion.  Subsequent doses should be adminis tered with premedication 
(e.g., IV diphenhydramine, 20-25 mg ( or equivalent) and IV dexa methasone 10 mg) and 
may be given at the same dose and rate.   
Severe/life-threatening symptoms (e.g. hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy, 
angioedema, respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y distress requiring bronchodilation ther apy, generalized 
urticaria): 
Stop infusion.  Administer IV diphenhydramine and dexamethasone  as indicated above.  
Add epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (adrenaline) or b ronchodilators i f indicated.  Do not reinitiate infusion.  
Do not retreat.  Report this event  as a serious ad verse event.

made to prolong the infusion time to two hours or more. 
 
7.4.3 Permitted therapy 
Patients may receive ongoing suppo rtive and palliative care (e. g. pain control) as 
clinically indicate d throughout the study. 
 
Infection Prophylaxis:  Prophylac tic use of anti-infectives is highly recommended during 
the period of profound neutropenia until ANC returns to 500/μL or greater. The choice of 
anti-infectives will be according to institutional protocol. Us e of anti-infective agents as 
prophylaxis and treatment must be documented on the case report forms.  Growth Factor support: The use of  growth factors will be accord ing to institutional 
protocol and/or according to ASC O criteria.(14) Use of growth f actors must be 
documented on the case report forms.  Transfusion support:  The use  of transfusion support (RBCs and platelets) will be 
according to institutional protocol.  Use of transfusion suppor t must be documented on 
the case report forms.  
7.4.4 Therapy that is not permitted 
Other anti-cancer treatment and other investigational therapy(ies) are not permitted 
during the Treatment Phase.  In t he event of persistent disease  or relapse the patient may 
receive other anti-leukemic ther api[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Administration of isolat ed doses of intrathecal 
chemotherapy is allowed.

between the terms “serious” and “severe”, which are not synonym ous, the following 
clarification is provided:  The term “severe” is often used t o describe the intensity (seve rity) of a speci fic event (as 
in mild, moderate, or severe myo cardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical signi ficance (such as severe headache) . This is not the same as

 Adverse events are to be recorded in the case report form from the start of the infusion on 
Day [ADDRESS_1131718] dose of study drug, with the  exception of serious 
adverse events. (See Section 9.2.2 ).  Leukemia Department Guide lines for AE recording 
will be used.  The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verif ying and providing source 
documentation for all adverse ev ents and assigning the attribut ion for each event for all

 Adverse events and protocol speci fic data will be entered into CORe/PDMS.  
CORe/PDMS will be used as the el ectronic case report form for t his protocol. 
 Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose that a causal relati onship between the medicinal product and 
an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., th e relationship cannot be ruled 
out. An unexpected ADR is any adv erse reaction not  identified in nature or intensity in 
the current Investigator’s Brochure.

An adverse event or suspected adv erse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of th e following outcomes: 
 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse drug e xperience – any adverse experi ence that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk  of death from the 
adverse experience as  it occurred. It does  not include an adver se experience that, 
had it occurred in a more severe  form, might have caused death.  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005] 
 A persistent or significant incap acity or substantial disruptio n of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require

General Description: 
This is a Phase II study of CPX-351 Liposome Injection in newly  diagnosed AML patients 
with high risk of induction mortality.  Two dose levels (50 units/m2 and 75 units/m2) of 
CPX-351 will be studied initially. The primary objective is to evaluate treatment response. 
The efficacy outcome is CR or CRi within two induction cycles.  A maximum of 30 patients will be equally randomized to the two dose levels. A Bayesian m ethod by [CONTACT_223906] (1995) 
PROTOCOL MDACC 2014-0548 
CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection September 9, [ADDRESS_1131724] been accrued to 
each dose level, an assessment of overall safety/dose limiting toxicities and efficacy will 
be made and one dose level will be chosen for further study. OR  if both dose levels are safe 
and further dose escalation seems possible, one additional coho rt with a dose of 100 
units/m2 will be open. A maximum of [ADDRESS_1131725] been 
studied, one dose levels will be chosen for further study. An e xpansion cohort of 10 patients 
will be treated at the dose level with a favorable response and /or toxicity profile for further 
evaluation for safety and efficacy. Consequently, the preferred  dose level has 25 patients 
evaluable.  Additional 25 patients will be added to the arm with the dose of 100 units/m2, the sample size for this arm will be up to 40, and the maximum number of p atients for all three arms 
will be up to 80.  Multc Lean software version 2.1 developed in the Department of Biostatistics MDACC 
was used for the study design.   The study will monitor futility and toxicity, and the monitorin g rules will be applied to 
each dose separately.  If study in one of the two doses is stop ped early due to futility or 
excessive toxicity, all the future patients will be enrolled in  the open dose arm (i.e.,  without 
randomization).  In the case the lower dose (50 units/m2) has b een shown to be too toxic 
at an interim look (thu s stop further patient enrollment) the h igher dose (75 units/m2) will 
also stop accrual.    
Futility monitoring: 
Treatment success is defined as achievement of CR or CRi. We will accrue a maximum of 
[ADDRESS_1131726] 
5% (meaning little or no activity) versus the alternative hypothesis that the true response 
is 30% or greater, independently in each treatment arm. Assumin g that the success rate is 
binomially distributed, this design with 15 patients in each ar m has 87% pow er and a one-
sided type I error rate  of 0.[ADDRESS_1131727] that:

E <0.25 + S |data)>0.95 
 
That is, if at any time during the study we determine that ther e is a greater than 95% chance 
that the response rate is less likely to improve by 25% than th e null hypothesis in one dose 
level, we will terminate the enrollment in that dose. Here E  represents the response rate 
for experimental drug in this study and  S represents the response rate for the standard 
practice (null hypothesis).  We assume that S has a distribution of beta (10, 190) to reflect 
the information on 200 patients for the historical data, which has a mean response rate of 
0.05 and a variance of 0.0002.  We also assume that E has a non-informative flat prior 
beta(0.1, 1.9) with mean of 0.05 and variance of 0.0158.

to coordinate scheduling of blood samples.  To faci litate preparedness for laboratory 
studies, please plan on initiati ng therapy in the subsequent morning if the clinical 
situation allows and please infor m us as soon as there is a pos sibility of patient entering 
the clinical trial.      Blood samples will be collected at the following times from patients in
 the Dose Escalation 
Phase:  Total of 2 samples will be collected.  
Cycle 1.     Day 1:  0 (pre-dose),    Two green top tubes (2  10mL)  
 24 h    O n e  g r e e n  t op tube   (1  10mL)  
 
For the pre-dose (sample 1), two tubes of blood (10mL each) wil l be collected in a 
V a c u t a i n e r  g r e e n  t o p  t u b e .   F o r  t h e  r e m a i n i n g  s a m p l e  ( s a m p l e  2 ) , one tubes of blood 
(10mL) will be collected in a Vacutainer green top tube.   The samples will be mixed and 
immediately put on ice-bath.  Samples will be brought to [CONTACT_684987] ndhi’s laboratory in the 
Tan zone (T1.3839).   T h e  b l ood will be centrifuged and plasma will be separated, 
transferred to storage tubes and immediately frozen, and stored  until analysis.  After 
removal of plasma, the blood cells will be resuspended in PBS a nd AML blasts will be 
isolated by [CONTACT_138789]-Hypaque densit y-gradient centrifugation proc edures.  Cells will be used 
for the following laboratory endpoints.    NOTE:  We may not be able to do all studies in every patient.  This will be decided based 
on diagnosis and number of leukemia cells recovered from the pe ripheral blood sample.

Version Date: 10/11/[ADDRESS_1276081]   
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is significant public health concern. Stress is a central component in modern 
theories of alcohol use, and stress is intimately related to drinking for many individuals. There are a number of 
approved medications for AUD, but the  majority of individuals do not respond to these medications and no 
medications address the role of stress. The current proposal looks affect alcohol use by [CONTACT_909005]- related 
systems in the body through peroxisome proliferator- activated receptors (P PARs), which may effect stress 
reactivity, stress- induced alcohol craving, and alcohol use. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (Actos) targets PPARγ and is FDA - 
approved for treating individuals with diabetes and metabolic disorders. Promising results from both human 
trials and  animal research suggest that pi[INVESTIGATOR_908940], including 
preliminary data from our own research. The current proposal will attempt to expand on our preliminary findings targeting alcohol use among treatment -seeking ind ividuals with AUD and elevated stress and/or 
anxiety with the following specific aims: 1) to assess if pi[INVESTIGATOR_908941]-  
induced craving in a human laboratory model; and 2) to assess if pi[INVESTIGATOR_908942]/anxiety, craving, and alcohol consumption. Notable strengths of the current proposal include:  
1) targeting individuals with elevated stress/anxiety and AUD; 2) biological assessment of stress reactivity 
(heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol); 3) a multi -dimensional assessment of alcohol craving 
incorporating relatively novel behavioral economic measures (i.e., alcohol demand, delay discounting); and 4) 
inclusion of powerful Bayesian statistical tools that are well suited for smaller samples, such as the current 
proposal.

 INTRODUCTION TO THE REVISED  PROPOSAL   
We thank the Reviewers for their thoughtful comments regarding the initial grant submission. Overall 
enthusiasm for the initial application was strong, with Reviewers highlighting the strength of the research team 
and sound study design. Below, we provide responses to the major Reviewers’ concerns. Relatively minor 
concerns have been addressed within the proposal. We believe that the application has been substantially 
strengthened as a result of addressing these concerns.  
 
The study would be improved by [CONTACT_909006]/anxiety that drink to cope.  
Response: As suggested, the revised proposal now targets individuals with elevated stress/anxiety (as done in our initial feasibility study, see Preliminary Data ) as well as those who report drinking to cope with 
stress/anxiety as measured by [CONTACT_909007] - Revised (DMQ- R)
1,2. Additionally, the 
revised statistical analyses will directly examine the relationship between changes in stress/anxiety and alcohol use, as affected by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_051].  
Transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) as mea sured by [CONTACT_909008]. Response: Reviewers’ 
comments were mixed regarding the SCRAMx. However, we acknowledge limitations of the system and have removed the SCRAMx in the revised submission. Removal of SCRAMx has also allowed us to address concerns 
regarding the trial duration, which has now been increased from [ADDRESS_1276082] and budget.  
Outcome measures related to alcohol consumption need to be operationalized and justified and the role of  
behavioral economic measures (delay discounting, alcohol demand) needs to be clarified. The revised 
submission now defines alcohol -related dependent measures as heavy drinking days in the past week (as 
highlighted by [CONTACT_909009]) and average drinks/day for the past week. Abstinence will be verified using ethyl 
glucuronide (ETG) test strips. The revised submission now clarifies that delay discounting and alcohol demand 
using a purchasing task will be assessed at weekly clinic visits to examine changes in crav ing and alcohol 
reward value, whereas a brief assessment of alcohol demand will examine changes in craving during the human 
laboratory model of stress reactivity. Previous studies have demonstrated that demand assessments are 
sensitive to experimental mani pulations, including acute laboratory stress inducers3. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_908943], clinical alcohol studies, and limited 
leadership on extramural projects.  Response: [CONTACT_670350]’s biosketch has been edited to highlight his recent work 
in human laboratory model studies and studies involving pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_908944]/anxiety systems 
for substance use disorders. We agree that [CONTACT_670350] has relatively little experience with clinical alcohol studies 
and limited leadersh ip on extramural projects, but he does have extensive and broad experience in addictions 
research for a variety of drugs of abuse as well as in implementing the behavioral economic measures proposed in the current study. He also has related experience in a ssessing medications for drug addiction that target 
stress related systems
4. 
The current proposal is also supported by a number of experienced researcher. [CONTACT_349893] (Co -I) is the Vice 
Chair for Research in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science s and Director of Research at 
UTHealth Harris County Psychiatric Center (HCPC). He has conducted numerous human laboratory studies, 
including among individuals with AUD5,6. [CONTACT_215942] (Co -I) is the Medical Director of the Center for 
Neurobehavioral Researc h on Addiction (CNRA) and is experienced in addictions research and will provide 
medical guidance and ensure participant safety over the course of the study. He has an extensive history 
serving on a number of NIH -funded studies for alcohol and has publishe d broadly on treatments and 
interventions for alcohol use disorders (AUD)7–12. Drs. Haass- Koffler (Consultant) and Vujanovic (Consultant) 
both have extensive experience in studies evaluating stress/anxiety and AUD13–24. They have provided valuable 
input in  developi[INVESTIGATOR_908945]. [CONTACT_91249] is an experienced biostatistician with expertise in Bayesian statistics, a unique strength of the current proposal. He also has experti se in analyzing medication effect data in addictions, including those 
that effect stress- related systems
4. 
Importantly, [CONTACT_670350] recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_908946] (see Preliminary 
Data ). Treatment -seeking individuals with ele vated baseline stress/anxiety and AUD ( N = 4) were 
administered pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (45 mg) in a single -blind manner for 4 weeks and completed stress -reactivity 
assessments at baseline and study week 4. All participants completed the study and systematic decrease s in 
stress reactivity, self -reported stress/anxiety, alcohol craving, and alcohol use were observed. We hope this 
information provides Reviewers with additional confidence in the PI [INVESTIGATOR_908947] R21 proposal.

 SPECIFIC  AIMS   
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a public health problem associated with significant health, social, and 
economic costs to society. Alcohol and stress/anxiety are intimately related. Alcohol activates the 
hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenocortical (HPA) -axis and s tress can increase the reward value of drinking. As 
time progresses, excessive drinking results in a number of behavioral changes marked by [CONTACT_909010], stress reactivity, and neuro -inflammation
25. FDA -approved pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_608556] ( e.g., 
naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram) are effective in less than one -third of treated individuals26. Importantly, 
none of the currently approved medications for AUD directly addresses stress reactivity, underscoring the 
need to develop novel pharmacot herapi[INVESTIGATOR_908948] -related processes associated with AUD.  
Peroxisome proliferator -activated receptors (PPARs) are promising therapeutic targets for addiction that 
exhibit both anti -inflammatory and neuro -protective responses in the brain27,28. Build ing on a strong and 
growing body of pre -clinical findings, recent trials in humans have shown promising effects for opi[INVESTIGATOR_908949]29,30. In regards to alcohol, the PPARγ agonist pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] 1) significantly reduced free -access alcohol 
consumption;an d, 2) attenuated alcohol consumption and withdrawal symptoms following stress exposure 
in rats bred to highly prefer alcohol31,32. We recently conducted a single -blind pi[INVESTIGATOR_908950]- seeking 
individuals with AUD and elevated baseline stress/anxie ty that demonstrated feasibility and showed promising 
decreases in stress reactivity, stress/anxiety, alcohol craving, and alcohol consumption following 4 weeks of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (see Preliminary Data ). 
The current proposal will build on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_908951] a double -blind, mixed -model design with a 
between -groups factor of dose (pi[INVESTIGATOR_341516]. placebo) and a within -subjects factor of time. Eligible 
participants will consist of treatment- seeking individuals with AUD who score high on screening measur es of 
stress/anxiety and stress -related drinking. Study medication (pi[INVESTIGATOR_341548]) will be administered for 
8 weeks. Relapse risk outcomes will be assessed using both a human laboratory paradigm of stress reactivity and stress -induced craving (Sp ecific Aim 1) and real -life measures of stress/anxiety, craving, and alcohol 
consumption (Specific Aim 2).  
Strengths of the current proposal include: 1) targeting individuals with elevated stress/anxiety and AUD; 2) 
biological assessment of stress reactivity (heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol); 3) a multi -dimensional 
assessment of alcohol craving in corporating relatively novel behavioral economic measures (i.e., alcohol 
demand, delay discounting); and 4) inclusion of powerful Bayesian statistical tools that are well suited for 
smaller samples, such as the current proposal.  
 
We propose the following S pecific Aims:  
Specific Aim 1: To examine the effects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_908952] -induced relapse risk in a  
laboratory model.  
Hypothesis 1a: Participants receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_908953] (heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortis ol) compared to those receiving placebo.  
Hypothesis 1b: Participants receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_908954] (subjective, alcohol demand) compared to those receiving placebo.  
 
Specific Aim 2: To examine the effects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_908955], stress/anxiety, and alcohol  
craving in the natural environment . 
Hypothesis 2a: Participants receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_908956]/anxiety compared to those receiving placebo.  
Hypothesis 2b: Par ticipants receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_908957].  
Hypothesis 2c: Participants receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_908958] 
(heavy drinking days, average drinks/day) compared to those receiving placebo.  
 
There is increasing attention and preclinical evidence supporting the potential role of the PPARγ system as a 
novel target in the treatment of AUD. From a translational perspective, this R21 project is timely and likely to 
advance our understanding of stress as a mechanism of action of pi[INVESTIGATOR_908959]. Additionally, this project 
will establish the feasibility of a paradigm for assessing medication effects under naturalistic and standardized 
laboratory conditions, thus setting the stage for subsequent R01 projects.

a value)[ADDRESS_1276083] of AUD.  AUD is 1) the 4th leading cause of death in the US (~88,000 
deaths/year), decreasing lifespan by ~30 years; 2) a tremendous economic burden on society (~$249 
billion/year), with the majority of these costs due to binge drinking; and 3) associated with a host of short-  and 
long-term negative consequences including violence, legal problems, morbidity, and family problems33–35. 
AUD and the Central Role of Stress.  Stress can enhance alcohol reward during initial stages of 
drinking36,37. However, persistent excessive drinking act s as a chronic stressor that 1) shifts brain systems 
beyond normal homeostatic limits into a state of allostasis; 2) which in turn alters physiological and brain motivational systems central for regulating alcohol use; and 3) has a negative impact on autoi mmune and 
inflammatory responses that can in turn influence alcohol use
38–42. Therefore, initial drinking is under 
relatively greater control of positive reinforcing effects of alcohol and impulsive characteristics of the 
individual. However, over time, dr inking takes on more compulsive characteristics as it becomes maintained by 
[CONTACT_909011], stress- related anxiety, alcohol craving, and 
decreased stress- resiliency and cognitive deficits from neuro -inflammatory  damage38,43,44. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_908960], none of the currently approved medications for AUD directly 
target stress or stress -related consequences associated with AUD, underscoring the need for pharmacological 
interventions th at target novel biological  systems.  
Targeting Stress -Reactivity and AUD through the PPAR System . PPARs are proteins that act as 
ligand -activated transcription factors, which are central to their anti -inflammatory actions45. Several PPAR 
isoforms (α, δ/β, γ ) have been identified, all of which are present in the CNS with relatively high activity46–48. 
PPARγ agonists can modulate genes linked to synaptic transmission and neuronal function in stress -related 
brain regions such as the amygdala and hippocampus49,[ADDRESS_1276084] 
observed promising effects of PPAR agonists on various aspects of drug use (e.g., discrimination, self - 
administration, reinstatement, sensitization) for several drugs of abuse including alcohol28. In alcoho l-related 
human studies, expression of PPARδ and PGC -1α, the coactivator of PPARγ, is altered in brains of individuals 
with AUD51. Associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and several PPAR genes related to 
PPARα and PPARγ have been found  for AUD and alcohol withdrawal using human genome wide association 
study (GWAS) data from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA)52. 
Currently, only the PPARγ isoform can be targeted in humans. PPARγ is highly expressed in a number of  
brain regions associated with drug reward53 and stress response31,32. Activation of PPARγ mediates 
neuroprotective responses against inflammatory damage, which can attenuate drug affects. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (Actos) is a PPARγ agonist and currently FDA- approved for the treatment of diabetes and metabolic disorders. 
Recent human addiction studies have shown pi[INVESTIGATOR_908961]
29 as well as 
nicotine craving30. In regards to pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]’s potential to address stress- related alcohol use , two preclinical 
studies indicate that pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] 1) significantly reduced alcohol drinking in rats; and 2) attenuated stress - 
induced alcohol drinking and alcohol withdrawal symptoms in rats bred to highly prefer alcohol, but did not 
affect cue -induced  alcohol drinking. Naltrexone did attenuate cue -induced alcohol drinking, but had no effect 
on stress- induced alcohol drinking, suggesting a unique role for pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]. More recently, our group 
collected preliminary data suggesting attenuation of stress -induced reactivity and weekly psychometric 
measures of stress/anxiety, alcohol craving, and alcohol use among individuals with AUD following 4 weeks of 
treatment with pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (see Preliminary Data ). Currently, there is one registered study (NCT0386414 6) 
assessing the effects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_908962], but that study does not appear to be 
targeting individuals with stress/anxiety in addition to AUD.  
Multi -Dimensional Assessment of Relapse Risk. Drug craving often serves as a proxy of  motivation 
to consume drug. Self -report craving measures are ubiquitous in addictions research but have limitations that 
have likely result in equivocal results54. We hope to mitigate these potential limitations by [CONTACT_909012] (i.e., alcohol demand, delay discounting) that are closely tied to drug use and a 
broader framework of drug addiction. Both delay discounting and drug demand have been associated with 
virtually every aspect of drug use (e.g., initiation, severity, relap se risk, etc.), and multiple meta -analyses have 
cemented the utility of these measures in addictions research55–58. These measures are not correlated, 
supporting a multi -dimensional model in which these measures represent distinct aspects of motivation to use 
alcohol54,59 –61. [CONTACT_670350] (PI) is an expert in utilizing behavioral economic measures in both human laboratory 
and clinical research involving individuals with SUDs.  
Bayesian Statistical Methods in Addictions Research.  The current proposal will incorporate 
Bayesian analytical methods in addition to traditional frequentist methods utilizing significance testing. Null 
hypothesi s statistica l testi ng under frequentist infe rence values a rigid focus on dichIoRtBomNUoMusBeEvRa:luHaStCio-MnsS-o1f8-0922

 INNOVATION   
The current proposal has a number of innovative features. First, we are targeting a relatively novel 
biological mechanism that has potential to expand treatment options, particularly for those in which stress - 
related process are a central component of the ir AUD. Second, we are utilizing a multi -dimensional assessment 
of relapse risk that includes stress- related biomarkers, traditional measures of alcohol craving, and behavioral 
economic measures. Third, this study will assess change in stress reactivity and stress- induced alcohol craving 
within a human laboratory model as well as changes in stress/anxiety, alcohol craving, and past 7 -day alcohol 
consumption (heavy drinking days, average drinks/day) in the natural environment. Fourth, the current 
proposal utilizes Bayesian statistical methods, which can be particularly useful in evaluating treatment effects in relatively small studies, necessitated here by [CONTACT_909013] R21 mechanism.  
 
 APPROACH   
Preliminary Data.  Our group has experience sa fely administering pi[INVESTIGATOR_908963]- seeking individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD). In a post hoc analysis, 
our group observed decreased alcohol use among individuals with concurrent CUD + AUD receivi ng 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_341516]. placebo in a study assessing cocaine craving and white matter integrity among individuals with primary CUD
64. Directly related to current proposal, [CONTACT_670350] (PI) recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_908964] 4 weeks of pi[INVESTIGATOR_286860] (45 mg) administered in a single -blind manner among treatment -seeking 
individuals with AUD and elevated baseline levels of stress/anxiety ( N = 4). Figure 1 below shows changes in 
laboratory stress reactivity measures following a cold -pressor challe nge to the stress axis (left panel) and 
weekly psychometric measures of stress/anxiety, craving, depressive symptoms, and alcohol consumption (right panel). All participants completed the study with no missed visits. Notably, decreases in all variables of interest were systematically observed over 4 weeks, with 3 of 4 participants reporting no drinking by [CONTACT_5875] 4. Accordingly, these preliminary data support both feasibility and potential utility of pi[INVESTIGATOR_908965] u se.

Participants.  We will enroll 60 participants to reach a target of N = 50 completers (25/group).  
Participants will consist of otherwise healthy treatment- seeking individuals with AUD exhibiting elevated 
baseline stress/anxiety. All participants will meet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:  
Inclusion criteria . Be treatment- seeking individuals diagnosed with AUD (DSM -5); be at least 18 years 
old and fluent in English; past month excessive alcohol use (>7 drinks/week for woman, >14 drinks/week for men, >3 drinks/ occasion for women>4 drinks/occasion for men)
35; exhibit baseline measures of either 1) 8 -23 
on HAM -A indicative of mild to moderate anxiety, 2) 14 -26 on PSS Score indicative of moderate stress, or 3) ≥[ADDRESS_1276087] “some of the time” to cope; 
and exhibit increased stress reactivity (increased physiological response and/or self -report) at the baseline 
stress reactivity assessment.  
Exclusion criteria.  Exhibit severe scores on the HAM -A, PS S, or PTSD checklist (PCL -5) – may be 
enrolled at the discretion of the admitting physician ([CONTACT_215942]); physical dependence on alcohol (CIWAA > 
10); greater than mild substance use disorder on drugs other than alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana; 
contraindi cations for taking pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]; medical conditions (e.g., congestive heart failure, clinically 
significant edema, clinically significant liver disease, hypoglycemia, diabetes, history of bladder cancer) 
contraindicating  pi[INVESTIGATOR_908967]  (e.g., CYP2C8  inhibitors 
or inducers, antihyperglycemic medications); be pregnant, nursing, or planning on becoming pregnant during 
the course of the study; females will need to agree to use of barrier methods of contracepti on due to 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]’s effects on plasma concentrations of oral contraceptives; have any other illness, condition, or use of medications, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_95918]/or admitting physician would preclude safe and/or 
successful completion of the  study.  
Baseline Screening.  Participants will receive a comprehensive medical and psychiatric evaluation 
including a medical -history questionnaire, physical examination, laboratory chemistries (e.g., blood chemistry 
screen, complete blood count, urinalysis and serum pregnancy test), and ECG. Clinicians will conduct the 
SCID , the ASI65, the KMSK66 assessment of lifetime substance use interview, and TLFB67. Alcohol 
dependence will be assessed using the SCID and the CIWA -A74. A CIWA -A score > 10 will be exclusion ary. 
Alcohol -Related Measures.  Assessment of alcohol use will include self -report (TLFB) and BrAC 
(Alco -Sensor FST, Intoximeters, Inc., Saint Louis, MO). The TLFB will be used to assessed the occurrence of 
heavy drinking days (>3 drinks/occasion for women> 4 drinks/occasion for men)[ADDRESS_1276088] 7 days and 
average drinks/day for the past 7 days. Severity of alcohol use will be assessed using the AUDIT69. Alcohol 
craving will be assessed using a 4 -item questionnaire75 during the stress reactivity assessment and the PACS 
at weekly clinic visits. Motivations for drinking will be assessed using the DMQ -R1, with demonstrated utility 
in the general2,76,77 as well as clinical78,79 populations. The DMQ -R consists of 20 questions assessing  
motivations for drink ing that are rated  on a 1 “almos t never/never” to  6 “almos t alwIaRyBs/NaUlwMaBy[CONTACT_909014]”Rs: cHaSlCe.-MEST-G18-w09il2l2

be assessed using dipcards with a 300 ng/ml cutoff. ETG dipcards show good agreement with traditional 
immunoassays80– 82. 
Behavioral Economic Measures.  During the stress reactivity assessment, alcohol demand will be 
assessed via the Brief Assessment of Alco hol Demand (BAAD)59. The BAAD is a [ADDRESS_1276089]. Yoon (PI)84–94. In 
addition to the standard money n ow vs. later choices, the delay discounting task will present choices between 
alcohol now vs. money later, which more closely models alcohol- related decision making and has also been 
demonstrated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yoon to be sensitive to weekly changes in drug use st atus for cigarettes87. 
Stress and Anxiety Measures. Stress and anxiety levels will be assessed using the HAM -A71, PSS72, 
and the PCL -573. Established norms will be used for the HAM -A and PSS to assess mild to moderate stress and 
anxiety and screen out for cases in which laboratory induced stress may be too aversive. The PCL -5 will be 
administered at baseline and Weeks 4 and 8.  
Study Medica tion and Compliance.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (Actos®, [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.) is 
FDA -approved for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2; has anti -inflammatory, neuroprotective, 
antioxidative, and anti -excitotoxic properties95; and extensive research has shown it to be safe and well  
tolerated  in human  patient  populations96,97. The medication  schedule  is based  on previous  work  from  our group 
showing that a daily dose of 45mg (maximum suggested dose) was associated with acceptable levels of tolerability, safety, and compliance in a study assessing the effects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_908968]
64. We will follow recommended ad ult initial dosing at 30 mg/d to reach a maintenance dose of 45 mg/d 
by [CONTACT_283968] 1, which is within standard titration parameters as per the investigator’s brochure.  
One week’s supply of the study medication will be dispensed. Cell -phone assisted re mote observation of 
medication adherence (CAROMA) will be used to assess compliance. Riboflavin will be added to medication 
capsules and urine ultraviolet fluorescent tests will be conducted at weekly clinic visits to also assess 
compliance. Participants w ill receive $[ADDRESS_1276090] for other Pi[INVESTIGATOR_908969].  
Assessment of Stress Reactivity. At baseline and Weeks 4 and 8, stress reactivity will be assessed using 
a modified cold- pressor task (CPT). The CPT is widely used as a stress- inducer in human 
laboratory studies and elicits moderate activation of the sympathetic nervous system and limited activation of the HPA -axis, which are two major stress systems in the body
98–101. HPA -axis activation during the CPT can be 
increased by [CONTACT_8246] a social evaluative component. These will include 1) a study member dressed in a 
white labcoat and taking notes on a clipboard; and 2) a webcam and  
monitor showing the participant’s face. Participants will be informed that 
their facial expressions will be assessed during the CPT. The addition of 
these social components during the CPT has been demonstrated to 
selectively activate the HPA -axis and significantly increase salivary cortisol 
levels100. During the CPT, participants will submerge their dominant arm in 
an ice -water bath for up to [ADDRESS_1276091] laboratory equipment. Saliva samples will be collected  in swabs 
using the Cortisol -Salivette® system (Sarstedt) and measured using the 
Cortisol ELISA Kit (Enzo Life Sciences), per manufacture instructions,  Table 2. Time Course for

 DATA ANALYTIC  STRATEGY  
Descriptive Statistics & Confounding Variables  Descriptive statistics will evaluate measures of 
central tendency (continuous) and frequencies (categorical) for study -related variables. General variable 
relationships will be evaluated using correlation analyses. Preliminary a nalyses will inspect relationships 
between sample characteristics (e.g., demographics), predictor variables (e.g., inflammatory markers), and 
specified outcome variables (e.g., resilience measures) via traditional statistical tests (e.g., chi -square, Mann-  
Whitney -Wilcoxon, Kruskal -Wallis, and t -tests). Sample characteristic variables demonstrating a relationship 
with both the predictor and outcome variables in a given model will meet criteria as a potential confounder
104,105 and included as a covariate in such models for hypothesis testing and explored as potential 
moderators of treatment group effects on experimental outcomes.  
Inferential Paradigm  Following recommendations in the literature106–108, analyses will utilize parallel 
frequentist and Bayesian st atistical inference. Frequentist results yield the probability of the data (or data more 
extreme), given the null hypothesis, whereas Bayesian results directly yield the probability of an alternative hypothesis
109. If possible, Bayesian analyses will incorporate informative priors as they develop in the 
literature; otherwise, weakly informative priors will be incorporated as a default. Sensitivity analyses using optimistic and pessimistic, skeptical priors will eva luate prior assumptions
110. Assessing the convergence of 
Bayesian analyses on the posterior distributions via Monte -Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) will use diagnostic 
evidence including effective sample size and scale reduction factors. Evaluation of posterior distributions will permit statements regarding the probability that effects of varying magnitudes exist, given the data. Statistical 
analyses will use the most up -to-date stable release version of the R statistical computing environment
111 using 
packages r stan111 and brms112. 
Statistical Modeling  Analyses will primarily use generalized linear modeling (GLM). Continuous, count, 
and dichotomous outcome variables will utilize normal, Poisson/negative binomial, and binomial distribution 
families respectively, w ith identity, log, and logit link functions as appropriate. Evaluation of distributional 
assumptions will use residual plots, formal statistical tests, and posterior predictive checking. Violations of assumptions will be addressed via transformation, robus t estimation, stratification, and/or coefficient scaling 
where appropriate.  
Missingness & Multiple Comparisons Missing data will be addressed via maximum likelihood, 
explicit modeling of missingness, and/or imputation where appropriate. Each approach is ro bust to ignorable 
missingness (i.e. MCAR and MAR). Sensitivity analyses will permit evaluation of the robustness of findings to missing data assumptions. While Bayesian analyses are not influenced by [CONTACT_909015], 
for the frequentis t analyses, all primary outcome variables (those specified by [CONTACT_909016]) will be evaluated at the α = 0.05 statistical significance level. Secondary analyses will 
examine additional predictor and outcome variables (e.g., other  inflammatory markers collected by [CONTACT_909017]); 
these and any otherwise post hoc analyses will employ false discovery rate (FDR) to control for Type I error.  
Specific Analyses  
Specific Aim 1: To examine the effects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_908952] -induced relapse ri sk in a  
laboratory model. Hypothesis 1a: Participants receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_908971] (heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol) compared to those receiving placebo. Hypothesis 
1b: Participants receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_908954] (subjective, alcohol demand) 
compared to those receiving placebo.  
For hypothesis 1a, GLMM will model each stress reactivity outcomes (primary: heart rate, blood pressure, 
and salivary cortisol) as a function of the main effec ts and higher -order interactions between time (baseline 
to Week 8), treatment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_341516]. placebo), and CPT measurement point (pre -CPT vs. post- CPT).  
Follow -up analyses will examine lower -order interactions longitudinally as well as cross -sectional c hanges 
from pre - to post -CPT at each time point. Variable relationships and analyses for hypothesis 1b will follow 
the patterns stated above for Hypothesis 1a, with craving in place of stress reactivity.  
 
Specific Aim 2: To examine the effects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_908972], stress/anxiety, and 
alcoh ol crav ing in the natural environment . Hypothesi s 2a:  P rIReBceNivUinMgBpEiRo:gHliStCaz-MonSe-1w8-i0l9l 22 
show greater re ductions in weekly psyc homet ric measure s of stress/a n mIaRrBy [CONTACT_909018]: DPASSTEa:n1d0/11/2023 
HAM -A) compared to those receiving placebo. Hypothesis 2b: Participants receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_908973] (primary measures: PACS) 
compared to those receiving placebo. Hypothesis 2c: Participants receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_908974] (primary measu res: heavy drinking days as defined by >3 
drinks/occasion for women and >4 drinks/occasion for men, average drinks/day) compared to those receiving placebo.  
For all hypotheses, GLMM will model primary outcome measures as a function of the main effects and 
interaction between treatment and time.  
 
Sample Size and Power Considerations  
Frequentist Analyses . Power for Specific Aim [ADDRESS_1276092] interaction between time, treatment, and CPT measurement point for a giv en measure of stress reactivity 
(transformed for normality) across k = 1000 Monte Carlo simulations (executed via SAS 9.4). Calculations 
assume the following conditions: α = 0.05, an autocorrelation of r = 0.50 between consecutive observations 
(with a deca y of r = - 0.10 for subsequent observations), and a small correlation of r = 0.05 for observations 
occurring at the same time point across groups. Based on these assumptions, the different sample sizes 
(pragmatic and pessimistic) stipulated in Table [ADDRESS_1276093] sizes 
(treatment group differences expressed as Cohen’s D, with effects unfolding in linear fashion over time). Power 
for Specific Aim 2 is based on evaluating reductions in drinks per week. Estimates are derived using G*Power  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assuming α = 0.05 (two -tailed) and an average baseline of drinks/week across participants (calculated 
as an average from 14 and 7 drinks/week for a 3:1 ratio  of males to females, respectively), the different sample 
sizes (pragmatic and pessimistic) stipulated in Table [ADDRESS_1276094] varying decreases in 
alcohol consumption.  
Bayesian Analyses . The Bayesian analyses in the current proposal will provide probabilistic estimates of 
effects for all hypotheses irrespective of statistical power. Moreover, the MCMC approaches utilized in Bayesian analyses do not rely on large sample size assumptions. Ba yesian analyses will focus on posterior probabilities ≥  
0.75 (equivalent to a Bayes factor = 0.33 or 3.0) that parameter estimates are greater or less than zero to emphasize the value in discerning model effects.

 STUDY  TIMELINE   
The time frame illustrated in Table 4 below is based on conservative estimates. We will continuously 
monitor our procedures and implement measure to enhance progress as indicated. Our goal is to enroll 60 
subjects to achieve 25 completers/group. However, we will continue to enroll subjects bas ed on available 
resources and subject attrition. Pre -award preparations following pre -award requests (just- in-time (JIT)) will 
include submitting an initial IRB protocol. Startup will include hiring and training of study staff. Over the course of the study , preliminary and final results will be presented at appropriate scientific conferences (e.g., 
Research Society on Alcoholism, College on Problems of Drug Dependence, Research Society on Alcoholism, 
etc.).

 PROTECTION OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS   
E.1. Risk to the  Subjects  
E.1.1.  Human Subjects Involvement and  Characteristics  
The [ADDRESS_1276098] will enroll male and female individuals (18 and older) regular alcohol users with past month 
excessive use of alcohol. Research data will be collected at screening, baseline, and weekly study visits.  
 
This study is funded by [CONTACT_909019] (NIAAA). All studies funded by 
[CONTACT_50533], including this study, now submit data to the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA) 
at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All subject data will be de -identifie d by [CONTACT_2329] a computer -generated 
global unique identifier (GUID) within the NDA database.  
 
The single study site is the Center for Neurobehavioral Research on Addiction (CNRA) at the University of 
[LOCATION_007] McGovern Medical School, Houston. The CNRA is centrall y located in a large U.S. metropolitan area 
known to have an adequate and representative alcohol -using population [see Facilities and Other Resources]. 
Moreover, the site has demonstrated its ability to recruit and retain the appropriate population using various 
recruitment strategies.  
 
We plan on recruiting 4 participants/month over the course of 20 months for a total of 80 enrolled participants. We estimate that 60 participants (75%) will complete the study, based on previous studies from our group. Recru itment strategies will include local advertising in print media, public service announcements 
on radio, and referrals to CNRA in the Houston metropolitan area. Additionally, we will utilize the SONA 
system, which provides University of Houston students cre dit for participating in various research studies.  
Potential participants will complete a brief phone screen to assess initial eligibility and subsequently invited to 
undergo a comprehensive baseline screening following informed consent. The baseline scree ning will include a 
full medical evaluation by [CONTACT_909020] ([CONTACT_215942]. Co -I). All participants will meet the 
following selection criteria.  
 
Inclusion criteria . Be treatment- seeking individuals diagnosed with AUD (DSM -5); be at least 18 years 
old and fluent in English; past month excessive alcohol use (>7 drinks/week for woman, >14 drinks/week for 
men, >3 drinks/occasion for women>4 drinks/occasion for men)35; exhibit baseline measures of either 1) 8 -23 
on HAM -A indicative of mild to moderate anxiety, 2) 14 -26 on PSS Score indicative of moderate stress, or 3) ≥[ADDRESS_1276099] “some of the time” to cope; 
and exhibit increased stress reactivity (increased physiological response a nd/or self -report) at the baseline 
stress reactivity assessment.  
Exclusion criteria.  Exhibit severe scores on the HAM -A, PSS, or PTSD checklist (PCL -5) – may be 
enrolled at the discretion of the admitting physician ([CONTACT_215942]); physical dependence on alco hol (CIWAA > 
10); greater than mild substance use disorder on drugs other than alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana; contraindications for taking pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]; medical conditions (e.g., congestive heart failure, clinically 
significant edema, clinically signifi cant liver disease, hypoglycemia, diabetes, history of bladder cancer) 
contraindicating  pi[INVESTIGATOR_908975]  (e.g., CYP2C8  inhibitors 
or inducers, antihyperglycemic medications); be pregnant, nursing, or planni ng on becoming pregnant during 
the course of the study; females will need to agree to use of barrier methods of contraception due to pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]’s effects on plasma concentrations of oral contraceptives; have any other illness, condition, or use 
of medica tions, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_95918]/or admitting physician would preclude safe and/or 
successful completion of the  study.  
 
E.1.2. Sources of  Materials  
We will obtai n information  about s ubjec ts from struct ured interview evaluations , phIRysBicNaUl eMxBaEmRi:nHaStiCo-nMsS, -s1e8l-f0-922 
report measures, biologica l samples , and behavioral  laborator y tasks.  T atIiRoBnAwPi[INVESTIGATOR_908976]:a1t0/11/2023  
specified time points during the study. The biological specimens obtained from all subjects will include urine, 
blood, salivary cortisol, and breath samples for alcohol detection. All materials will be obtained for the specific 
purposes of this research.  
 
E.1.3. Potential  Risks  
Medication. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (trade name [CONTACT_909025]) is approved by [CONTACT_909021]. 
According to the prescribing information for Actos “Over [ADDRESS_1276100] 2 years.”  
 
In addition, several studies have taken place in non- diabetic patients. Sixty non -diabetic patients with 
hypertension were treated with pi[INVESTIGATOR_908977], finding a significant reduction in diastolic 
blood pressure in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_908978]113. 
 
Another larger study in non -diabetic hypertensive patients found a significant reduction in biomarkers of 
insulin resistance and chronic systemic inflammation in pi[INVESTIGATOR_908979]114. An additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_908980] 29 no n-diabetic patients with Alzheimer’s disease at a dose up to 45mg 
daily for [ADDRESS_1276101] infections, edema, headache, sinusitis, myalgia, and p haryngitis.  
 
Hypoglycemia: Patients treated with insulin or other antidiabetic medication in addition to pi[INVESTIGATOR_908981]. Due to this risk subjects with diabetes will be excluded.  
 
The most significant potential side e ffect of pi[INVESTIGATOR_908982]. Due to this 
potential side effect, all subjects will be carefully screened for congestive heart failure (CHF) using 
Framingham criteria and no subjects with CHF will be enrolled, and weight  will be monitored closely for 
increased fluid retention. Also, EKGs will be repeated every two weeks to monitor for changes.  
 
Hepatic effects: Although there was no evidence of drug induced hepatotoxicity from clinical trials, post - 
marketing reports of f atal and non- fatal hepatic failure have been made in patients taking pi[INVESTIGATOR_908983]. Due to this risk, liver function tests will be performed every two weeks during the trial.  
Urinary Bladder Tumors: Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder o f male rats in a two -year 
carcinogenicity study (https://general.takedapharm.com/actoplusmetpi/ ). In clinical studies, two 3- year trials in 
which pi[INVESTIGATOR_908984], according the prescribing information “there were 
16/3656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking ACTOS compared to 5/3679 (0.14%) in patients 
not taking ACTOS. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one y ear at the time 
of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.16%) cases on ACTOS and two (0.05%) cases on placebo.  
There are too few events of bladder cancer to establish causality.”  
 
Fractures: In female patients with diabetes treated for a year with pi[INVESTIGATOR_908985] a higher rate of bone 
fractures (5.1%) compared to placebo (2.5%). There was no increase in fractures in male patients.  
 
Laboratory Values: Clinical trials showed a slight reduction in hemoglobin and hematocrit (2 -4%) over 12 
weeks of treatment, likely related to increased plasma volume and not associated with any clinically significant 
hematologic effects.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC- MS-18-0922 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 10/11/2023  

Ovulation: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_908986]- postmenopausal women. In addition, other medications 
in this same class have reduced the plasma concentrations of oral contraceptives. Because of these facts, female 
subjects must agree to an effective barrier method of contraception.  
 
Pregnancy: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_908987] C. There are no known adverse events of pi[INVESTIGATOR_908988]. Animal studies using doses [ADDRESS_1276102] a highly favorable risk/benefit profile for pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]. Thirty men and 
women with CUD received randomly assigned treatment of pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (n=15) or placebo (n=15) in double - 
blind fashion for [ADDRESS_1276103] 10% of participants included not sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_102641], diarrhea, stomach pain, cough, and increased urination. All were rated mild with none 
occurring significantly more frequently in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_908989]. One participant in the placebo group 
experi enced a serious adverse event (coronary artery vasospasm) that was diagnosed as cocaine -induced and 
required an emergency department visit.  
 
Blood draw:  The principal risk is hematoma at the venipuncture site, which is not serious and disappears 
after seve ral days. CNRA phlebotomists drawing blood will are trained in venipuncture techniques to minimize 
extravasation.  
 
Stress Reactivity: Cold pressor task. Individuals with cardiovascular disorders and neurological 
disorders should not participate in the cold -pressor task due to cardiovascular change induced by [CONTACT_502390]. 
This information will be obtained during medical screening. Due to individual variation in pain and cold 
sensitivity, for some subjects the cold water may become too painful to sustain imme rsion for [ADDRESS_1276104] in ice water (~0° Celsius) for [ADDRESS_1276105] this 
telephon e-screening interview. Eligible subjects will be scheduled for an in -person intake visit at which time a 
research staff member will present the informed consent form. The consent form will detail the requirements 
of study participation (e.g., # of visits, type of data collected, time commitment, etc.).  
 
Subjects will be told that the purpose of the study is to evaluate a medication’s effect on their alcohol use in 
their natural environment and following exposure to an acute stressor. Information about each  study 
procedure will be explained. Subjects will be informed that they will attend weekly clinic sessions and to take their medication. Other information on the consent form will include a full description of study requirements, 
reimbursement, risks, bene fits, alternatives, and the role of the local IRB. All questions will be answered 
before written consent is requested.  
 
E.2.2. Protection Against  Risk  IRB NUMBER: HSC- MS-18-0922 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 10/11/[ADDRESS_1276106] risk of side effects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_051], 
including those with congestive heart failure, significant liver disease, edema, and diabetes, as well as risks of 
alcohol use (pregnant women). Monitoring of weight to capture potential fluid retention will occur at e ach visit. 
Weekly assessment for edema and urine pregnancy will occur. Twice monthly serum chemistry and hematology 
will take place to monitor liver functions and hemoglobin/hematocrit. In addition twice monthly EKGs will be 
done. Female subjects must agre e to use an effective barrier method of birth control to minimize risk of 
pregnancy.  
 
Confidentiality will be protected in several ways. All information collected solely for research purpose will be 
kept in locked, restricted access files. Subject records will be coded and filed by a number code. Subject 
identities will not be revealed in a ny publication of the data. Individual subject information will be transferred 
to outside sources only with the express written request of the subject. Subjects will receive a copy of their signed consent form.  
 
E.3. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subject and  Others  
There are no potential benefits for participants. However, knowledge gained from the current proposal may benefit future individuals with AUD.  
 
E.4. Importance of the Knowledge to be  Gained  
Results from the current proposal may help develop novel pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_908990]. AUD is a public health issue with substantially negative effects on health and society. Results 
from the current proposal will help inform future medication development efforts.  
 
The above stated risks are re latively mild in degree and procedures have been designed to minimize their 
probability. We believe this protocol has an extremely favorable risk/benefit ratio. The clinical research at the 
CNRA has an excellent track record in conducting controlled trials  with the utmost attention to safety.  
 
 
 DATA SAFETY MONITORING  PLAN   
This plan describes the general data and safety monitoring procedures for the proposed study. A detailed DSM plan will be submitted for approval prior to starting the study.  
 
1. The Principal Investigators (Yoon, Lane) will be responsible for knowing the policies of the local IRB. In 
this capacity, they will maintain accurate documentation of IRB correspondence and reports and oversee the handling of all possible study -related adv erse events. The CNRA has longstanding data collection and safety 
monitoring system in place that will be available for the proposed study. This includes staff training, manual driven processes, weekly audit of data collection/entry, medical screening with  results reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_2394] -site 
nurse and physician, use of standardized assessments, continued medical monitoring during treatment, use of 
a certified (CLIA) analytical laboratory to perform urine toxicology testing, procedures to monitor medication 
complian ce (e.g., riboflavin), collaboration with the statistician who oversees data analysis and system 
management. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_908991].  
 
2. A DSM Board will be formed to provide additional, independent oversight of data related to patient 
safety. Membership will include Drs. Jan Blalock (UT -MDA Cancer Center), Edward Fann (Baylor College of 
Medicine -Psychiatry), Daryl Ishaq Shorter (Baylor College of Medicine ), and Claudia Pedrozo (UTHealth). 
Selected individuals have relevant expertise and experience in monitoring clinical trials. This committee will 
perform the following activities: (a) review the research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring; ( b) 
evaluate study progress, including data quality, participant recruitment rates, retention rates, outcome and 
adverse experience data,  and risk versus benefit profile; (c) make recommendation sIRtoBtNerUmMiBnEatRe: tHhSeCt-rMiaSl-18-0922  
because of safety concerns ; and (d)  protect the confi dentialit y of the thIReBreAsPuPltRsOoVf AmLoDnAitToEri:n1g0./11/2023  
3. Adverse events (AE) will be reported to the local IRB on an annual basis. Serious adverse events will be 
reported immediately (verbally within 24 hours) to the IRB, the DSMB, and to the NIDA. A written report will 
follow as soon as possible but in no more than three days. The written report will be in the format required by 
[CONTACT_909022], description of the AE, severity rating 
(Grade 1 to 4), assessment of cause, whether the AE indicates an increased risk for current or future subjects, 
and whether changes to the informed consent form are  necessary.

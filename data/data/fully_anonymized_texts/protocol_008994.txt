Amendment 2 ([ADDRESS_1199045] 2023 ) 
This amendment is considered substantial based on the criteria defined in EU Clinical 
Trial Regulation No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union because it significantly impacts the scientific value of the study.  
Overall rationale for the  current Amendment:  
To allow the inclusion of renal and lung solid organ transplant patients as of 18 years of 
age (YoA)  and above . Renal and lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_860242] 18 YoA and above are 
at high risk of RSV -related LRTD, due to the life -long imm unosuppressive therapy 
received for allograft rejection prevention regardless of their age [Dropulic, 2016; 
Fishman, 1998; Reichenberger, 2001] . 
Because of the safety signal of preterm birth observed in the RSV MAT -009 study, the 
initial RSV OA=ADJ -023 study protocol allowed only for the inclusion o f participants as 
of 50 YoA (refer to Section 2.3.1).  
Further evaluation of the preterm birth signal based on different analyses of the RSV 
MAT -009 study data, research on plausible biological mechanisms and r ecommendations 
by [CONTACT_860272]:  
• There is an identified risk for preterm birth in pregnant women vaccinated during the 
late second and third trimester with the RSV MAT vaccine candidate ( refer to 
Section 2.3.1) and therefore pregnant women should be excluded from participation 
in the current study.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
219900  (RSV OA=ADJ -023) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199046] 2023  6 • The biological mechanism behind the identified risk of preterm birth in pregnant 
women who received the RSV MAT vaccine candidate is not known. Nevertheless, 
there is no t heoretical mechanism to suggest a risk to future pregnancy for women 
vaccinated prior to pregnancy.  
• Precautionary measures to mitigate the risk of exposure to the RSV PreF3  OA 
vaccine at any time during pregnancy, such as not enrolling pregnant individuals,  
pregnancy testing before each administration of the study vaccine and adequate 
contraception for at least 1 month before the study intervention administration until 
the study end are included in the inclusion criteria in this study. (Refer to 
Section  10.4.1 for definitions of women of childbearing potential, menopause and 
Section 10.4.2 on adequate contraception).  
Given the high observed efficacy of the RSV PreF3  OA vaccine in clinical studies in 
individuals 60 YoA  and older, and taking into account the pre cautionary measures to be 
implemented for th is study and the unmet medical need in the renal and lung solid organ 
transplant patient population as of 18 YoA, the anticipated benefit -risk of the RSV PreF3  
OA vaccine supports the continued clinical developmen t in less than 50 -year-old non -
pregnant adults at increased risk, especially the immunocompromised  (IC) population .

2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Study rationale  
[COMPANY_004] has developed a  RSVPreF3 OA  vaccine against RSV -associated (subtypes A and B) 
disease in adults ≥[ADDRESS_1199138] 
approved for use in adults ≥60 YoA in the US on 03 May 2023, EU on 06  June 2023 , [LOCATION_006] 
on 07 July 2023, C anada on 04 Aug 2023 , and Japan on 25 September 2023, under the 
tradename [CONTACT_860314] . Additionally , immunocompromised  patient s such as SOT  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , 
who are under chronic immunosuppressive therapy required to prevent organ rejection, 
are at high risk of severe RSV -LRTD . The aim of this  open -label study is to evaluate the 
immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational  vaccine 
in an immunocompromised (lung and renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , 18 YoA  and above ) 
population and assess whether a second dose o f the vaccine increases the immune 
response . 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199139], referred to as 
RSV -A and RSV -B [Borchers , 2013] . RSV causes RTI in people of all ages. In addition 
to the high BoD in children and older adults (≥60 YoA ), RSV infection is an important 
cause of severe lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_860247] [ Pochon , 201 9]. Currently, 
there are 2 vaccines available for preven tion of RSV infection in  adults ≥60 YoA; Arexvy 
(manufactured by [CONTACT_23983]) and Abrysvo  (manufactured by [CONTACT_3954]) . 
[COMPANY_004]  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_860248]3 OA vaccine (Arexvy ) for patient 
populations at increased risk of RSV -LRTD.  
Recent in -house results from a Phase 3 clinical trial in older adults (RSV OA=ADJ -004) 
demonstrated that one dose of the RSV PreF3  OA investigational vaccine -induced strong 
humoral and cell -mediated immune responses, which remained above pre -vaccination 
levels up to at least [ADDRESS_1199140] -vaccination. In another large Phase 3 vaccine clinical 
trial (RSV OA=ADJ -006) in adults aged 60 years and above, the vaccine candidate 
demonstrated an overall vaccine efficacy of 82.6% (96.95% CI, 57.9 –94.1) against 
RSV -LRTD  up to [ADDRESS_1199141]-vaccination . The vaccine was well tolerated with a n 
acceptable  safety profile  [Papi, 2023] . The study is still ongoing to assess other 
endpoints. Howeve r, all studies done until now included only non -IC participants.  
In general, IC patients are at increased risk of severe disease following an infection and 
tend to have lower immune responses following vaccination [ Dropulic , 2016]. The IC 
population is a heterogenous group of patients which include patients with SOT, cancer 
patients (hematologic and solid organ tumors)  on active treatment, patients on 
immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases, patients with congenital immuno -deficiencies, 
and patients living with HIV  with low CD4 T -cell counts. Within the IC population, the 
SOT patients are under  chronic immunosuppressive therapy required to prevent organ 
rejection,  which places them at high risk of severe RSV -LRTD associated with a high 
morbidity and mortality  [Dropulic , 2016; Fishman , 1998; Reichenberger , 2001].  
The BoD of RSV infections is well-documented in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], with 
mortality  attributable to RSV -LRTD in this population reported from 10 to 20%  
[Neemann , 2015] . Although RSV burden in renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_860249] d, those patients like other IC patients remain at increased risk for 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_860250] -LRTDs in particular, due to the IC status 
and immunosuppressive therapy.  In general, IC patients exhibit lower immune responses 
following vaccination. Nevertheless, a recent clinical trial demonstrated that an 
adjuvanted RZV was immunogenic in chronically immunosuppressed renal transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ≥18 YoA [ Vink , 2020].

pI[INVESTIGATOR_330474] a potential risk for 
this vaccine . Refer to Section 8.4.4  for details . 
Hypersensitivity 
reactions 
(including 
anaphylaxis)   Previous exposure to components of the 
vaccine might have induced  an immune 
response that results in an exaggerated or 
inappropriate reaction.  All participants will remain under observation at 
the clinical center for at least [ADDRESS_1199143] be readily 
availabl e during this period.  
Participants with a history of hypersensitivity or 
severe allergic reaction to any component of the 
vaccine are excluded from study enrollment . 
Syncope 
(fainting)  Syncope (fainting) can occur following or 
even before study intervention 
administration as a psychogenic response 
to the needle insertion.  Participants who mention experiencing previous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_448818], during 
or after vaccination, will be asked to lie down 
during the intervention and remai n under 
observation at the clinical center for at least [ADDRESS_1199144] be readily 
available during this period.  
Allograft 
rejection  Allograft rejection is a theoretical concern 
with adjuvanted vaccines in solid organ 
transplant participants. To date, there is no 
evidence of an increased risk of allograft 
rejection as demonstrated in ZOSTER -041 
study  [Vink, 2020], nor with other vaccines.  During the informed consent process for 
vaccination, the participants  will be informed of 
this potential risk and the need to inform the 
clinic /site and see k medical attention if unwell 
after vaccination. Clinical management of 
allograft rejection will be per local standard of 
care and recorded as AE/SAE, as appropriate. 
The occurrence of allograft rejection during the 
study will be described.  
Study procedures  
Local reactions 
at the injection 
site Intramuscular vaccination commonly 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263] a transient and self -limiting 
local inflammatory reaction. This may 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_227187], 
erythema/redness, and swelling.  Physician can implement the measures that they 
consider necessary.  
Solicited local adverse events (AE) will be 
collected and reviewed up to Day 7  following 
vaccination . 
Local reactions 
at site of blood 
draw  Pain, redness, irritation, and bruising may 
occur at the site where blood is drawn . Physician can implement the measures that they 
consider necessary.

maternal vaccine candidate (RSVPreF3 Mat) administered to 18 –49-year-old women in 
the late second or third trimester of pregnancy.  
In February 2022, [COMPANY_004] decided to stop enrol lment  and vaccination in RSV maternal 
vaccine studies involving pregnant women. This decision was taken because of an 
observed imbalance in the proportion s of both preterm birth s and neonatal deaths (death 
of an infant within the first 28 days of life) in the treatment group vs. the placebo group 
in the RSV  MAT -[ADDRESS_1199147] -birth interim analysis (DLP 04 October 2022) of the RSV 
MAT -[ADDRESS_1199148] not established what caused the observed imbalance in preterm 
births . 
The vaccine candidate for older adults ( RSV PreF3 OA vaccine ), contains the same RSV 
antigen as the RSV maternal vaccine candidate but the RSV PreF3  OA vaccine is 
combined with [COMPANY_004]’s established AS01E adjuvant to boost the immun e response in the 
OA population.

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199149] prior to each

associated with pregnancy as the informed consent contains specific information 
regarding the RSV Maternal study.  
The RSV PreF3  OA vaccine trials in participants ≥60 YoA  are closely monitored for 
safety with all available safety data reviewed internally. In addition, the Phase 3 RSV

an ongoing Phase 3 trial  (RSV OA=ADJ -006) in participants ≥[ADDRESS_1199151] RSV season and no 
unexpected safety concerns were observed  (refer to IB).  
However, patients under immune suppression often respond less well to vaccines, and 
therefore , the information obtained in this study , namely whether a second dose can 
increase the immune response in IC patients,  will further aid the development of the 
RSV PreF3  OA vaccine . It will be  the first time  the vaccine will be administered  in IC 
participants ≥18 YoA , who are generally at an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_860251] -

Another benefit for all study participants may include gaining information about their 
general health status through the medical evaluations/assessments associated with this 
study (i.e., extra  physical examination).  
2.3.3.  Overall benefit -risk conclusion  
The RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine is in clinical development. Considering the 
measures taken to minimize the risk to participants in this study, the potential risks a re

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199159] 2023  46 • Approximately 250 IC adults ≥ 18 YoA w ho received a renal or lung SOT, will be 
randomly assigned (1:1) to the following 2 IC groups (1 dose versus 2 doses; 
125 participants each) at Visit 1 (Day 1). Each group may include approximately 
65% renal transplant patients and approximately 20% lung t ransplant patients, and 
the remaining patients can be freely distributed across the 2 groups.  
− RSV_IC_1 group:  IC patients receiving 1 dose of RSVPreF3 OA  
investigational vaccine at Visit 1 (Day 1).  
− RSV_IC_2 group : IC patients receiving 2 doses of RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine at Visit 1 (Day 1) and Visit 3 (Visit 1 + 30 -60 days).  
• Approximately 125 healthy adults ≥50 YoA (distributed among age categories of 
50-59 YoA  (30 %) , 60-69 YoA  (30%) , ≥70 YoA  (20% ), and 20% to be freely 
distributed over the different age categories) will be assigned to the healthy 
participants  group.  
− RSV_HA group : Health y participants  receiving 1 dose of RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine at Visit 1 (Day 1).  
Primary completion date:  Visit 4 ( [ADDRESS_1199160] study intervention 
administration ). 
Duration of the study:  The total duration of the study, per participant, will be 
approximately 13 -15 months for the IC patients and 12 months for the healthy 
participants.  
Type of study:  self-contained.  
Data collection:  A standardized eCRF will be used. Solicited events will be collected as 
of the day of each study intervention administration and for 6 subsequent days . 
Unsolicited AEs, new concomitant medications/vaccinations will be collecte d as of the 
day of each study intervention administration  and for 29 subsequent days. As of Day 30 
following each study intervention administration, the details are collected in source 
documents prior to entering them in the eCRF until study end.  
Safety mo nitoring:  The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_860277] 
(Refer Section 8.3.4  and Section 10.1.6 ). 
4.2. Scientific rationale  for study design  
RSV is associated with serious illness in OA and high -risk adults, including those who 
are immunocompromised  that may lead to increased risk of RSV -LRTD. The efficacy of 
a single dose of the RSVPreF3  OA investigational vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
LRTD in OA ≥60 YoA has been  shown in the Phase  3 clinical study RSV OA=ADJ -006 
(refer to IB).  
Since the immune response in IC patients is often lower compared to healthy persons, t he 
current study is designed as a Phase 2, open -label  study to evaluate  the immune response , 
safety , and reactogenicity  of 1 versus 2 doses of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine in

information and will help to make an informed decision on the need to use 1 dose versus 
2 doses by [CONTACT_860278] (in terms of GMT ratios in neutraliz ation  
titers against RSV -A and RSV -B, as well as ce ll-mediated immunity) in the [ADDRESS_1199163] dose (including M onth 6 and Month 12) between both groups of SOT 
patients as well as comparison to healthy participants will provide important information 
on waning of the immune response. In this study, the inclusion of a group of healthy 
adults ≥50 YoA will help to better elucida te the potential differences in immunogenicity 
and safety in the SOT patient groups versus healthy participants as of 50 YoA . Having 
head -to-head comparison with the healthy group will aid in the characterization of the 
immune response (both humoral and cell-mediated ) of the IC population. Specifically for 
RSV, it is important that the healthy group is included in the same study since the primed 
status of the healthy adults and therefore the immune response to the vaccine, might 
differ between studies, as  RSV seasonality can be different across countries/regions and 
years.  Moreover , a head -to-head comparison with the healthy participants group will also 
enable further characterization of the reactogenicity of RSV PreF3  OA vaccine in IC 
population.

Not applicable . 
4.3. Justification for dose 
A single dose (0.5 mL) or 2 doses of the licensed formulation (120 μg 
RSVPreF3/AS01E) will be used in this study.  
Since the immune response in immunocompromised patients is often lower compared to 
healthy persons, this study will investigate the impact of a second dose given 1-[ADDRESS_1199164]  dose. Therefore, t he current study is designed as a Phase 2, o pen-label 
study to evaluate the immune response , safety, and reactogenicity of RSVPreF3 OA

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199180] 2023  57 6.3.3.  Intervention allocation to the participant  
The order of study intervention assignment is generated (permuted block randomization ) 
and stratified by [CONTACT_860284] a [COMPANY_004] RTS M system . The subject level 
study intervention assignment activity is conducted using a [COMPANY_004] RT SM system . 
Each IC group may include approximately 65% renal transplant patients and 
appro ximately 20% lung transplant patients, and the remaining patients can be freely 
distributed across the 2 groups. Recruitment caps for patient transplant populations are 
managed by [CONTACT_860285] M system . 
For the healthy participant group, participants will be enr olled in 3 age categories, with 
approximately 30% of participants 50 -59 YoA, approximately 30% of participants 
60-69 YoA, and approximately 20% of participants ≥  70 YoA. The remaining 20% can 
be distributed freely across the 3 age categories. Recruitment c aps for age group 
populations are managed by [CONTACT_860285] M system . 
Within each group 30% participants will be assigned to CMI subset ( See Section 6.3.4  for 
details ). 
The RTSM system will assign randomisation number and corresponding study grou p at 
time of randomisation as well as the study intervention number at time of each study 
intervention administration . 
When RTSM system is not available, please refer to the Pharmacy  Manual for 
instructions . 
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual  for additional information about the study intervention 
number  allocation.  
6.3.4.  Allocation of participants to CMI assay subsets  
Participants contributing to the CMI subset will be recruited from a selected number of 
countries and selected number of clinical  sites. In the selected sites, the investigator will 
allocate if possible,  at Visit 1, the first participants in each group  to the CMI subset until 
the allocated target is reached.  The subsets are detailed in Table 9 below .

7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of study intervention  
Discontinuation of study intervention refers to any participant who has not received all 
planned doses of  the study intervention.  In rare instances, it may be necessary for a 
participant to permanently discontinue study intervention. If study intervention is 
permanently discontinued, the participant should, if possible,  continue other study 
procedures (e.g., safety or immunogenicity), planned in the study protocol at the 
discretion of the investigator.

7.1.1.  Contraindications to subsequent study intervention 
administration  
The eligibility for subsequent study intervention administration must be confirmed before 
administering any additional dose.  
Participants who meet any of the criteria listed below or criteri a listed in Sections 5.2.1  
and 5.2.2  should not receive additional doses of study intervention. Such participants 
should be encouraged to continue other study procedures, at the investigator’s discretion. 
All relevant criteria for discontinuation of study intervention administration must be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
• Participants who experience any SAE judged to be possibly or probably related to 
study intervention or non -study concomitant vaccine/product, including 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
• Participants who develop any new condition which, in the o pi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], may pose additional risk to the participants if they continue to 
participate in the study.  
• Anaphylaxis following the administration of study intervention.  
• Condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscul ar 
injection unsafe.  
• Occurrence of a new pI[INVESTIGATOR_723667], in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], expose the participant to unacceptable risk from 
subsequent vaccination. In such cases, the investigator should use their clinic al 
judgment prior to administering the next dose of the study intervention. Refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for the definition of pI[CONTACT_28839].  
• Occurrence of a new AESI or the exacerbation of an existing AESI that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], exposes the participant to unacceptable risk from 
subsequent doses of study intervention. Refer to Section 8.4.4  for the definition of 
AESI.

7.2. Participant discontinuation/withdrawal from the study  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at the participant’s own request 
for any reason (or without providing any reason).  
A participant may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion  of the investigator for 
safety, behavioral, or compliance reasons.  
Investigators will attempt to contact [CONTACT_103706] -up. 
All data and samples collected up to and including the date of withdrawal of/last co ntact 
with the participant will be included in the study analyses.  If the participant  withdraws 
consent  for disclos ure of future information, the s ponsor may retain and continue to use 
any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent . 
A participant can request for the destruction of their samples any time during the study. 
The investigator must document the request in the site study records. If a participant 
withdraws from the study, any samples taken and not tested, should not be teste d, and 
should be destroyed, if applicable , as per local re gulations . 
The primary reason for participant discontinuation/ withdrawal from the study will be 
documented in the eCRF based on the list below:

Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs/SAEs must be clearly 
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigator will 
follow participants who are withdrawn from the study due to an AE/SAE /AESI  until the 
event is resolved , stabilized, ot herwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
7.3. Lost to follow -up 
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if the participant  repeatedly fails to 
return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298].  
The f ollowing actions must be taken if a participant  fails to return to the clinic for a 
required study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299] /caregiver  and reschedule the missed 
visit as soon as possible,  within the allowed visit interval , counsel the participant on 
the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and  ascertain whether the 
participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] /caregiver  (where possible, 
3 telephone calls, and if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known 
mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_103075]’s medical record.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, the participant will be considered 
to have withdrawn from the study.  
• Site personnel, or an independent third party, will attempt to collect the vital status of 
the participant within legal and ethical boundaries for all participants randomized, 
including those who did not get study intervention. Public sources may be searched 
for vital status information. If vital status of the participant is determined as 
deceased , this will be documented  and the participant will not be considered lost to 
follow -up. Sponsor personnel will not be involved in any attempts to collect vital 
status information.  
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
• Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 1.3). Protocol 
waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
• Adherence to the study de sign requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor as soon as they 
occur or when the study team becomes aware of them. In case of doubts of 
immediate safety concerns regarding the inclusion of a possible participant, inclusion 
should be postponed until a decision can be made.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
219900  (RSV OA=ADJ -023) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199192] 2023  64 • All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that  potential 
participant s meet all eligibility criteria. Subjects who have signed informed consent 
but are not eligible to proceed should be recorded in the eCRF with a status of 
‘screen failure’ . The investigator will maintain a log of all participants screened. All 
relevant inf ormation, such as confirmation of eligibility and reasons for screening 
failure will be mentioned in this screening log.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (e.g., 
blood count)  and obtained before signing of the IC F, and those  conducted during the 
entire duration of the study  may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes , as 
well as for safety follow -up (e.g., SoC tests to assess occurrence of allograft rejection 
in SOT patients) provided the procedures met the  protocol -specified criteria and 
were performed within the timeframe defined in the SoA . 
• Study participants may decide to assign a caregiver to help them complete the study 
procedures. Please refer to the Definition of Terms  for the definition of a caregiver.  
− A caregiver can be appointed by [CONTACT_499045], 
when the participant feels it is necessary. Caregiver should  receive the caregiver 
information letter before providing support to the study participant. Ideally, a 
single caregiver should be appointed by [CONTACT_860290], in some situations, it 
may happen that several caregivers will support a study participant throughout 
the conduct of the study. This should be recorded in the source documents. 
However, every effort should be done to ensure that only one caregiver enters 
the data into the paper diary to allow for timely completion.  
− Caregivers may help the study participants with performing some practical study 
procedures such as receiving or making phone calls to site staff, planning study 
visits, transcribing responses to diaries, transportation to and from the study site 
etc. However, at no time, the caregiver should evaluate the participant’s health 
status while answering diaries or make decisions on behalf of the participant. At 
the first study visit , the site staff should inform the participant of the possibility 
to appoint a caregiver. Then at subsequent study visit(s), the site staff should 
check again with the participants if they wish to appoint a caregiver or if there 
were or will be changes of caregiver.  
• In the event of a significant study -continuity issue (e.g., caused by a pandemic), 
alternate strat egies for participant visits, assessments, study intervention distribution 
and monitoring may be implemented by [CONTACT_103708], as per local 
health authority/ethics requirements.  
• It is preferred to have all visits on -site. However, d uring special circumstances (e.g., 
COVID -19 pandemic , SOT patients in whom health has deteriorated during the 
study , or for whom the transfer to the clinic has become very difficult ), the specific 
guidance from local public health , if applicable , and other compe tent authorities 
regarding the protection of individuals’ welfare must be applied and  consulted with 
the sponsor . For the duration of such special circumstances, the following measures 
may be implemented for enrolled participants:  
CONFIDENTIAL  
219900  (RSV OA=ADJ -023) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199193] 2023  65 − Follow -up visits (Visit 3 in HA  and IC 1-dose group s, and Visit s 2, 4, 5, and 6 
for all groups ) may be conducted at the participant’s home (by [CONTACT_860291] a home care service system), if appropriate.  If home visits are not possible, 
telephone calls or other means of virtual contacts may be used.  
− Diary cards may be transmitted from and to the site by [CONTACT_860292].  Biological samples may be collected at participant’s hom e. 
Biological samples should not be collected if they cannot be processed  in a 
timely manner or appropriately stored until the intended use.  Home Visits are 
not allowed for participants in the CMI subset  (due to time-sensitivity of CMI 
samples) except in s pecial circumstances and with the prior approval of the [COMPANY_004] 
central study team.  
• Impact  of visits performed outside of the site’s location on the PPS for 
immunogenicity will be determined on a case -by-case basis.  
• The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of 
the study, related to procedures in this study, will not exceed [ADDRESS_1199194] demographic data such as year of birth, age at the time of study intervention 
administration,  sex, race *, and ethnicity * in the participant’s eCRF . 
Collection  of sex, race and ethnicity data is necessary to assess and monitor the diversity 
of the trial participants , and to determine if the trial participants  are truly representative  of 
the impacted  population.  
*Differences in the safety and efficacy of certain medical products,  including vaccines 
[Haralambieva , 2013; Pérez -Losada , 2009; Kollmann , 2013] have been observed in 
racially and ethnically distinct subgroups. These differences may be attributable to 
intrinsic factors (e.g., genetics, metabolism, elimination), extrinsic factors (e.g., diet, 
environmental exposure, sociocultural issues), or interactions between these factors. 
Therefore, both geographic ancestry (race) and ethnicity will be collected for all study 
participants.  
Age is collected to stratify the population and determine the impact  of the study 
intervention  by [CONTACT_654] . 
8.1.2.   Medical/vaccination  history  
Obtain the participant’s  relevant  medical/vaccination history by [CONTACT_163549]/ participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  and/or review of the participant’s 
medical /vaccination  records. Record any  relevant  pre-existing conditions, signs and/or

[IP_ADDRESS].  Potential immune -mediated diseases  
Potential immune -mediated diseases (pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170]) are a subset of AESIs that include 
autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest 
which may or may not have an autoimmune etiology. AEs that n eed to be recorded and 
reported as pI[INVESTIGATOR_159201] 17. 
In order to facilitate the documentation of pI[INVESTIGATOR_159204], a pI[INVESTIGATOR_860260] a list of preferred terms (PTs) and PT codes corresponding to the above 
diagnoses will be available to investigators at study start.  
The investigator(s) must exercise their medical/scientific judgment to determine whether 
other disease s have an autoimmune origin (i.e., pathophysiology involving systemic or 
organ -specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and should also be recorded as a pI[CONTACT_28839]. In 
addition, the investigator should categorize each pI[INVESTIGATOR_330488] a new onset condition (if 
it start ed following vaccination) or as an exacerbation of a pre -existing  chronic condition 
(if it exacerbated following vaccination)  in the eCRF .

Within the framework of the study, transplant rejection that occurs at any time during the 
study will be considered and recorded as an A ESI. 
Transpla nt rejection occurs when transplanted tissue is rejected by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_841] ’s 
immune system, which destroys the transplanted tissue.  Diagnosis of rejection relies on 
patient signs and symptoms, laboratory data, imaging or other technical procedures 
and/or tissue biopsies. The investigator  will take into consideration all available 
information , including biopsy results,  to decide whether or not organ  rejection occurs.  
Clinically , management of allograft rejection will be as per local standard of care.  
Any form of rejection should be recorded and  reported to the sponsor or designee  as 
indicated in Section 10.3. 
When there is enough evidence to make any of the above diagnoses, the AE must be 
reported as AESI. Symptoms, signs or conditions which might (or might not) lead to one 
of the above diagnoses, should be recorded and reported as AEs but not as AESI s until 
the final or definitive diagnosis has been made, and alternative diagnoses eliminated or 
shown to be less likely.  
8.4.5.  Regulatory reporting requirements  for SAEs /pregnancies/ AESI s 
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_330225] /pregnanc y/AES I is 
essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward  the safety of 
participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
See Section  8.4.1  for reporting timeframes.  
For SAEs/AESIs, the investigator must always provide an assessment of causality at the 
time of the initial report, as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information ( e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to local requirements.

If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to  the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the female 
participant ’s pregnancy.  
Any pregnancy  complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons 
will be reported as an AE or SAE.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth,

This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary  and 
secondary  endpoints. Supportiv e analyses  and demography summaries will be described 
in the SAP.  
9.3.1.  Primary endpoints/estimands analyses  
The co -primary endpoints/estimands are described in Section 3. The primary analysis will 
be performed on the PPS.  
MGI, i.e., the geometric mean of the within -participant ratios, of serum neutralizing titers 
against RSV -A and RSV -B post -Dose 2 (Visit 4) over post -Dose 1 (Visit 3) will be 
computed with their 95% CI in the RSV_IC_2 group.  
CIs for MGI will be based on a back transformation of CI for the mean of the difference 
between log10 -transformed values, assuming that log -transformed values are normally 
distributed with unknown variance.  
Missing data will not be imputed . 
9.3.2.  Secondary endpoints/estimands analyses  
Refer to Section 3 for the definition of secondary immunogenicity (humoral  and CMI 
response) and safety endpoints. The immunogenicity analysis will be based on the PPS 
and safety analysis will be based on the ES.  
For humoral immune response, the following analysis will be tabulated for each 
immunological assay (RSV -A and RSV -B neutralization titers):  
• Percentage of participants above pre defined  threshold and GMT, with 95% CI, at

9.4. Interim analysis  
9.4.1.  Sequence of analyses  
The following analyses will be performed stepwise:  
• PCA  (Primary completion analysis) : A first analysis will be performed on all 
immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety data available and as clean as possible, 
when data for at least primary and secondary endpoints up to Visit 4 are available. 
This analysis will be considered as final for those endpoints*.  
• Month [ADDRESS_1199238] dose : A second analysis will be perfor med on all immunogenicity 
and safety data available and as clean as possible, when data for at least secondary 
endpoints up to Visit 5 are available. This analysis will be considered as final for 
those endpoints*.  
• An end of study  analysis will be performed when all data for at least secondary 
endpoints up to study conclusion (Visit 6) will be available.  
* Each analysis can be considered as final, as it is based on data that is as clean as 
possible. However, the consecutive analysi s of the same time point might slightly 
differ at the next analysis e.g., when Month 6 data are re -analyzed at the time of 
Month 12 analysis. If major changes are identified, they will be described in the 
clinical study report.

− RSV_IC_2 group : N = 125; IC patients receiving 2 doses of vaccine; first dose 
at Visit 1 and second dose at Visit 3.  
• Approximately 125 healthy adults ≥50 YoA (distributed among age categories of 
50-59 YoA (30%), 60 -69 YoA (30%), ≥70 YoA (20%), and  20% to be freely 
distributed over the different age categories ) will be assigned to the healthy adults 
group.

at Visit 1.  
A 20% attrition rate is accounted from enrolled to evaluable participants.  
9.5.1.  Sample size justification  
The study is aimed at describing the immune responses and exploring potential 
differ ences, between the immune response of IC patients  (either after 1 or 2 doses of RSV 
vaccine) and the immune response of healthy participants. Given the descriptive nature of 
the study, no multiplicity adjustment is implemented. The sample size for this des criptive 
study is determined based on the rationale of adequately detecting relevant differences 
between immune responses:  
• Effect  of the second vaccination in IC patients  (within -participant comparison)  
In IC patients  receiving [ADDRESS_1199240] -Dose 2 (Visit 4) and post -Dose 1(Visit 3). The power and fold -increase that

• For site termination:  
− Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor ’s procedures, or GCP guidelines  
− Inadequate or no recruitment (evaluated after a reasonable amount of time) of 
participants by [CONTACT_093]  
− Total  number of participants included earlier than expected  in the study  
If the study is prematurely terminated or temporarily suspended, the sponsor shall 
promptly inform the investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any 
contract research o rganization(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or 
temporary suspension, as specified by [CONTACT_1214]. The

10.2.  Appendix 2: Clinical laboratory tests 
10.2.1.  RSV-A and RSV -B neutralization assays  
The serum neutralization assay is a functional assay that measures the ability of serum 
antibodies to neutralize RSV entry and replication in a host cell line.  
Virus neutralization is performed by [CONTACT_117838] a fixed amount of RSV -A strain (Long, 
ATCC No. V R-26) or RSV -B strain ([ZIP_CODE], ATCC No. VR -1580) with serial dilutions of 
the test serum. The serum -virus mixture is then transferred onto a layer of Vero cells 
(African Green Monkey, kidney, Cercopi[INVESTIGATOR_227203] , ATCC CCL 81) and incubated 
for [ADDRESS_1199250] RSV (Polyclonal anti -RSV -A/B IgG) and a 
secondary  antibody conjugated to horse -radish peroxidase, allowing the visualization of 
plaques after coloration with TrueBlue  peroxidase substrate. Viral plaques are counted 
using an automated microscope coupled to an image analyzer (Scanlab system with a 
Reading software or equivalent). For each serum dilution, a ratio, expressed as a 
CONFIDENTIAL  
219900  (RSV OA=ADJ -023) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199251] 2023  99 percentage, is calculated between the number of plaques at each serum dilution and the 
number of plaques in the virus control wells (no serum added). The serum neutralizing 
titer is expressed in Estimated Dilution 60 and corresponds to the inverse of the 
interpolated serum dilution that yields a 60% reduction in the number of plaques 
compared to the virus control wells, as described by [CONTACT_2312] [ Barbas , 1992; Bates , 
2014].  Secondary standards calibrated against the international reference ( NIBSC 16/284) 
[McDonald , 2018; McDonald , 2020] are included in every run to allow conversion into 
international units per millilit er. 
10.2.2.  Intracellular cytokine staining  
The ICS is used to assess RSVPreF3 -specific CD4+ and/or CD8+ T  cells expressing at 
least [ADDRESS_1199252] 1 cytokine among CD40L, 4 -1BB, IL -2, 
TNF -α, IFN -γ, IL-13, IL -17 (secondary endpoint).  
As previously described [ Moris , 2011], thawed PBMCs are stimulated in vitro in the 
presence of anti -CD28 and anti -CD49d antibodies either with pools of 15 -mer peptides 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_10373] 11 amino acids and spanning the sequence of the RSVPreF3 protein, or 
with medium . After 2 hours of incubation at 37oC, Brefeldin A is added to inhibit 
cytokine secretion during an additional overnight incubation at 37oC. Cells are 
subsequently harvested, stained for surface markers (CD4+ and CD8+) and then fixed. 
Fixed cells are then permeabilized and stained with label ed antibodies specific for the 
following immune markers:  
• CD3+: phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] T  cells;  
• CD40L (CD154), expressed on activated CD4+ T  cells, [ Chattop adhyay , 2005; 
Frentsch , 2005; Samten , 2000; Stubbe , 2006];  
• IL-2: key for the development, survival and function of T  cells [ Boyman , 2012];  
• TNF -α: anti -viral/intracellular factor, pro -inflammatory cytokine, cytotoxicity 
[Sedger , 2014];  
• IFN-γ: anti -viral factor, associated with the Th1 -like profile [ Schoenborn , 2007];  
• 4-1BB (CD137), expressed on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T  cells [ Wölfl , 2008];  
• IL-13: associated with the Th2 -like profile [ Bao, 2015];  
• IL-17: associated with the Th17 -like profile [ Korn , 2009].  
After staining with the markers above, the cellular samples are analyzed by 
[CONTACT_1603]-cytometry allowing to determine the frequency of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T  cells 
expressing the marker(s) of interest per million of total CD4+ and/or CD8+ T  cells.

recording, evaluating, follow -up, and reporting  
10.3.1.  Definition of AE  
AE definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not 
considered related to the study intervention.  
• NOTE:  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of a study intervention.  
Events Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or 
urinalysis) or other safety assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically 
significant in the medical and s cientific judgment of the investigator (i.e., not 
related to progression of underlying disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New condition detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention - intervention 
interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clini cal sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. Such overdoses should be  reported regardless of sequelae.  
• Events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated procedures (i.e. , invasive 
procedures, modification of participant’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abno rmal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_11009]’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy , appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , admission for routine examination. ).

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets one or 
more of the criteria listed:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
− In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12994] 
(usually involving at least an over night stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91261]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in 
the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_860263], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered 
serious.  
− Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
− The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  
− This definition is not intended to incl ude experiences of relatively minor 
medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) that may 
interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  in the offspring of a study participant  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( e.g., spontaneous abortion, f etal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy)  
CONFIDENTIAL  
219900  (RSV OA=ADJ -023) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199255] 2023  102 • Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via an authorized medicinal 
product  
• Other situations:  
− Possible Hy’s Law case: ALT  ≥ 3x ULN AND total bilirubin ≥  2x ULN 
(>35% direct bilirubin) or INR >1.[ADDRESS_1199256] be reported as SAE  
− Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by [CONTACT_103091]. These events should usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or development of intervention 
dependency o r intervention abuse.  
10.3.3.  Solicited events  
• Definition of solicited event 
Solicited events  are predefined events  (administration site events and systemic events ) 
for which the participant /participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) is specifically questioned, and 
which are noted by [CONTACT_2299] /participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) in their diary.

record the oral/axillary  temperature in the evening , using a sponsor provided device . If 
additional temperature measurements are taken at other times of the day, 
participants /participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s)  will be instruc ted to record the highest

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199257] 2023  103 10.3.4.  Unsolicited AE  
• Definition of unsolicited AE  
An unsolicited AE is an AE that was either not included in the list of solicited events or 
could be included in the list of solicited events but with an onset outside the specified 
period of follow -up for solicited events. Unsolicited AEs must have been 
communicated by [CONTACT_4317] /participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  who has signed the 
informed consent. Unsolicited AEs include both serious and non serious  AEs.  
• Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (i.e., symptoms or illnesses 
requiring a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency room visit , or visit to/by a healthcare 
provider). The participants /participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  will be instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_285147](s), as well as 
any events that, though not medically attended, are of par ticipant ’s/participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s)  concern. Detailed information about reported unsolicited AEs 
will be collected by [CONTACT_14348]’s 
records.  
• Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended nor perceived as a concern by [CONTACT_2416] /participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  will be collected during an interview 
with the participant /participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  and by [CONTACT_330542] . 
10.3.5.  Recording , assessment  and follow -up of AE, SAE, AESIs  and 
pregnancies  
[IP_ADDRESS].  AE and SAE recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics 
reports) related to the event.  
• The inves tigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information.  
• It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s 
medical records to [COMPANY_004]  in lieu of completion of the  eCRF /required form.  
• There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_860264] . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_31785] . 
• The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not 
the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
• A pDiary will be used in this study to capture solicited administration site or 
systemic events. The pDiary will be distributed to all participants at Visit 1. The 
participant should be trained on how and when to complete the pDiary. If a 
CONFIDENTIAL  
219900  (RSV OA=ADJ -023) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199258] 2023  104 participant is unable or not willing to complete the pDiary him/herself, h e/she may 
be helped by a caregiver (refer to  Definition of Terms  for the definition of caregiver).  
• Anyone who measures administration site or systemic events and who will record the 
event in the pDiary, e.g., the study caregiver, should have received a caregiver 
information letter explaining the role of the caregiver prior to completing the pDiary. 
This training must be documented in the partici pant’s source record.  
• For each solicited and unsolicited AE the participant experiences, the 
participant /participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  will be asked if they /the minor participant  
received medical attention (defined as unscheduled visit to or from medical 
personnel for any reason, including emergency room visits). This information will be 
recorded in the participant’s pDiary or in the participant’s diary (for solicited AEs) 
and in t he participant’s eCRF as part of normal AE reporting (for unsolicited AEs) . 
Medical attention received for SAEs/AESIs will have to be reported using the 
normal AE reporting process in the eCRF . 
• If any individual other than the participant /participant’s par ent(s)/LAR(s)  is making 
entries in the pDiary, their identity must be documented in the participant’s source 
record.  
• Note: pDiary may be completed by a minor participant  under the supervision of the 
participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) provided the minor is capa ble of assessing and 
reporting the information to be recorded on pDiary . The ultimate accountability for 
completion of the pDiary remains with the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s). The 
investigator should discuss this accountability with the participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s).  
• The investigator or delegate should verify the reported information during a 
discussion with the minor participant preferably in the presence of their 
parent(s)/LAR(s).  
• Collect and verify completed pDiary during discussions with the partici pant on 
Visit  3 (all groups ) and 4 (IC 2-dose group) , respectively . 
• Any unreturned pDiary will be sought from the participant /participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s)  through telephone call(s) or any other convenient procedure.  
• The investigator or delegate will transcribe the required information into the eCRF in 
English.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE , AESI  and SAE 
reported during the study and assign it to one of the following categories:  
• Mild:  
A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
219900  (RSV OA=ADJ -023) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199259] 2023  105 • Moderate:  
A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional spec ific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.  
• Severe:  
A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily li ving, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
• The intensity of the following solicited AEs will be assessed as described:  
Table 24 Intensity scales for solicited events  in participants ≥ 18 YoA (IC 
group ) and ≥ 50 YoA  (HA group ) 
Event  Intensity grade  Parameter  
Pain at administration site  0 None

everyday activities  
2 Moderate: Painful when limb is moved and interferes with 
everyday activities  
3 Severe: Significant pain at rest. Prevents normal everyday 
activities

Arthralgia (joint pain)  0 None ** 
1 Mild: Arthralgia present but does not interfere with activity  
2 Moderate: Arthralgia that interferes with normal activity  
3 Severe: Arthralgia that prevents normal activity  
* Refer to the SoA  (Section 1.3) for the definition of fever and the preferred location for temperature measurement.  
**For participants  already experiencing some of the solicited systemic  events, ‘None ’ corresponds to  ‘similar to 
baseline ’ and only discomfort above baseline  is to be reported as ≥ 1. 
The maximum intensity of administration site redness/swelling, and fever will be scored 
at [COMPANY_004] as follows:

3 >100 mm  >39.0°C (102.2°F)  
The investigator will  assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgment.  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with an SAE. Grade 3 
is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets 1 of the pre defined  
outcomes as described in the Section 10.3.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of causality  
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE . The investigator will use clinical judgment to 
determine the relationship.  
• A reasonable possibility of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration, will be considered and investigated.  
• For causality assessment, the investigator will also consult the IB and/or product 
information, for marketed products.  
• The investigator must review and provide an assessment of causality for each 
AE/SAE and document this in the medical notes There may be situations in which an 
SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the 
initial report to  [COMPANY_004] . However, it is very important that the investigator always make 
an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE 
data to  [COMPANY_004] . 
• The investigator may change their opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality 
assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting re quirements.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Follow -up of AEs, SAEs, AESIs  and pregnancies  
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_330547]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, 
or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• New or updated information will be recorded  in the originally submitted documents.  
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
• After the initial AE/SAE/AESI/pregnancy or any other event of interest, the 
investigator is required to proactiv ely follow each participant at subsequent 
visits/contacts. All SAEs  will be followed until the event is resolved, stabili zed, 
otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up. 
• Other non serious  AEs must be followed until end of study  or until the participant is 
lost to follow -up.

SAE Reporting to  [COMPANY_004] via an Electronic Data Collection Tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to [COMPANY_004] will be the electronic data 
collection  tool. 
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) to report the event within 24 hours.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be 
taken offline to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken offline, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next 
section) . 
• If the site during the course of the study or post -study  becomes aware of any serious, 
nonserious  AEs, pregnancy exposure, related to any [COMPANY_004] non -IMP they will report 
these events to [COMPANY_004] or to the concerned competent authority via the national 
spontaneous reporting system.  These will be classified as spontaneous ICSRs.

This section covers wording on the definition of what we consider to be a woman of 
childbearing potential as well as guidance on what is considered as adequate 
contraception.  
10.4.1.  Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)  
A woman  is considered WOCBP (fertile)  from the time of menarche until becoming 
postmenopausal  unless permanently sterile (see below) . 
Note: Menarche is the first onset of menses in a young female. Menarche is normally 
preceded by [CONTACT_860306].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Woman of Nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP)  
Women in the following categories are considered WONCBP:  
• Premenopausal  female p ermanently sterile due to one of the following procedures : 
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented  bilateral oophorectomy  
For permanently sterile individuals due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above, (e.g., Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis), 
investigator discretion should be applied to determining s tudy entry. If reproductive 
status is questionable, additional evaluation should be considered .

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199265] 2023  110 Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenop ausal female  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
• A high  FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in  women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. 
How ever, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than 
one FSH measurement is required.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt must discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrol lment . 
10.4.2.  Contraception guidance  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)  
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to 
use a highly effective contraceptive method consistently and correctly according to the 
methods list ed in [COMPANY_004]’s list of highly effective contraceptive methods  (Table 26).

10.5.  Appendix 5: Grading scales in scope of the SOT population  
10.5.1.  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification in R Tx patients  
Stages of CKD quantify the severity of the disease. CKD is classified into 5 stages 
[Levey , 2005].  
• Stage 1: Normal GFR (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2) plus either persistent albuminuria or 
known structural or hereditary renal disease  
• Stage 2: GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 
• Stage 3: 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 
• Stage 4: GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 
• Stage  5: GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 
GFR (in mL/min/1.73 m2) in CKD can be estimated by [CONTACT_91019] -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_144326]: 
141 × (serum creatinine) -1.209× 0.993 age. The result is multiplied by 1.018 if the 
patient is female, and by 1.159 if the patient is African American. For female African 
Americans, the result is multiplied by 1.018 × 1.159 (1.1799). Alternatively, GFR can be 
estimated using timed (most commonly 24 hours) urine creatinine clearance using 
measured serum and urine creatinine; this equation tends to overestimate GFR by 10 to 
20%. It is used when serum creatinine assessment may not be as accurate (e.g., in patients 
who are sedentary, very obese, or very thin). Serum cystatin C is an alternativ e 
endogenous GFR marker used as a confirmatory test in people with nonrenal factors 
affecting serum creatinine level (e.g., extremely high, or low muscle mass, exogenous 
creatine intake, amputations or neuromuscular diseases, and high protein or exclusivel y 
plant -based diets). GFR is calculated using CKD -EPI [CONTACT_196856] C equation.  
The CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_330494] -Gault formulas, 
particularly for patients with a GFR near normal values. The CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_860265] p ositive results indicating chronic kidney disease and predicts outcome 
better than the other formulas.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Revised equations for eGFR from serum creatinine in Japan  
In Japanese population other equations might be used [ Matsuo , 2009]. The literature 
reports that the new Japanese coefficient for the modified IDMS –MDRD Study equation 
and the new Japanese equation are more accurate for the Japanese population than the 
previously rep orted equations. If such equations are used to calculate eGFR they should 
be provided to the sponsor prior to the study start (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
CONFIDENTIAL  
219900  (RSV OA=ADJ -023) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199267] 2023  112 IDMS –MDRD Study equation with new Japanese coefficient:  
• 3-variable Japanese equation:  
eGFR = 194 x SCr-1.094 x Age-0.287 (x 0.739 if female)  
• 5-variable Japanese equation:  
eGFR = 142 x SCr-0.923 x Age-0.185 x Alb0.414 x SUN-0.233 (x 0.772 if  female)  
Alb = Albumin; eGFR  = estimated glomerular filtration rate; IDMS  = isotope dilution mass spectrometry; MDRD = 
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease; SCr  = serum creatinine ; SUN  = serum urea nitrogen  
Although  the 5 -variable Japanese equation estimates GFR more accurately than other 
equations, SUN and albumin are not routinely measured in Japan.  
Because the new 3 -variable Japanese equation provided reasonably accurate eGFRs, it 
was recommended to use the new 3 -variable Japanese equation.

Albuminuria and proteinuria can be measured using excretion rates in timed urine collections, ratio of  
concentrations to creatinine in spot urine samples , and using reagent strips in spot urine samples.  
The conversions are rounded for pragmatic reasons. (For an exact conversion from mg/g of creatinine to mg/mmol 
of creatinine, multiply by 0.113) Creatinine excretion varies with age, sex, race and diet ; therefore, the 
relationship among thes e categories is approximate only.  The relationship between urine reagent strip results 
and other measures depends on  urine concentration.

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199270] 2023  114 Explanatory statement concerning Gender Distribution (Article 7, paragraph 2 (12) 
of the German GCP ORDER).  
For this study, there is no intention to conduct specific analyses investigating the 
relationship between gender and the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the 
investigational RSV PreF3  OA vaccine. Recruitment will include both males and females. 
To not expose p regnant women and their fetuses/children to an investigational vaccine, 
females enrolled in this study will either be of non childbearing  potential (i.e., 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_330480] -menopause), or if 
she is of chil dbearing potential, she must have a negative pregnancy test and use 
appropriate methods of contraception for the study duration (refer to the study protocol, 
Section 5.1 “Inclusion criteria” and Section 5.2 “Exclusion criteria”). Women who are 
pregnant, planning to be come pregnant or breastfeeding are excluded from this study.  
Remote Source Data Verification during exceptional situations in [LOCATION_013]  
Frequent instream monitoring of safety data by [CONTACT_860308]. Instream review o f study data items and processes should be considered 
during exceptional situations/circumstances, such as with pandemics like COVID -19, 
focusing on key data points, patient assessments and processes that are critical to ensure 
the rights, safety and well -being of study participants and the integrity of the study and 
data. Prior to any rSDV activity a written agreement by [CONTACT_860309]. 
The agreement includes the extent and the method of rSDV activities. Monitoring Plan 
and Study -Specifi c Risk Register will be updated to include rSDV activities and CRAs 
will be guided for the conduct of rSDV.  
Option 1 Transfer of redacted Source Documentation  
Process for transfer and review of redacted source documentation provided by [CONTACT_779]:  
• The CRA in structs study site on the source data needed for the remote SDV 
activities.  
• The CRA instructs site staff they must pseudonymize the requested documentation, 
do a quality check that anonymized (redacted) areas cannot be read, and then 
delivers the documenta tion to the CRA in an encrypted form of communication (the 
site should have a documented process).  
• The minimum requirements regarding quality of the copi[INVESTIGATOR_860267]:  
− For the scanning of paper documents resolution will be a minim um of 300 dpi.  
− For the scanning of photographs and images resolution will be 600 dpi 
[CONTACT_130677].  
− Color scanners must be able to produce copi[INVESTIGATOR_860268].  
− A4 format as final size without loss of information.  
− Documents will be saved as PDF.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
219900  (RSV OA=ADJ -023) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199271] 2023  115 − In ord er to maintain quality standards, a captured image will not be subjected to 
non- uniform scaling (i.e., sizing) or re -sampling to a lower resolution.  
• Redacted source document scans will be sent to the CRA via email using 1 of the 
following secure options:  
− TLS connection:  
TLS connections are intended to support significant mail flow between [COMPANY_004] and 
external partners in a secure manner.  
− [COMPANY_004] Secure  
In cases where only a handful of users are communicating or the volume of emails is 
low, the use of [COMPANY_004] secure, t he [COMPANY_004] ad -hoc message encryption solution is 
recommended.  
− Password protected PDF attachment  
A password protected scan (PDF) will be attached to an email. The password to open 
the attachment will be send in a separate email.  
• The CRA may use the secure email  website to assess whether the sites email address 
is secure (i.e., encrypted).  
 
• Prior to starting remote SDV the CRA ensures that the provided documents are 
complete and does not contain any personal information.  
− In case the CRA detects any personal info rmation that has not been redacted, the 
CRA informs the study site and deletes the files (incl. the Recycle bin).  
− A Data Breach must be reported Data Breach Web Report Form.  
• Use of an external PC screen is recommended. The CRA will not generate any 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_860269].  
• Source data verification/review will be conducted according to the process outlined 
in the [COMPANY_004] Monitoring SOP.  
• After completion of SDV activities, the CRA deletes all copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/images of participant 
data received from the site. This includes the deletion of the recycle bin and any 
temporary files.  
• A statement confirming that all documents were destroyed will be provided by [CONTACT_860310].  
• Details of what was monitored remotely will be documented in the appropriate 
section of the Monitoring Visit Report.

219900  (RSV OA=ADJ -023) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1199272] 2023  116 Option 2 – Review of Subject Source Documentation remotely  
Process for use of Webcams, WebEx, MS Teams for viewing participant source 
remotely:  
• The CRA ensures that the site personnel sharing information with [COMPANY_004] hav e 
authority to do so.  
• Remote SDV activities will be performed exclusively by [CONTACT_860311].  
• Prior to conducting any remote SDV activities the CRA ensures that a written 
informed consent, covering the proposed SDV activities, has been signed by [CONTACT_790424].  
• For CRAs using [COMPANY_004] laptops, only use [COMPANY_004] approved video conferencing tools 
(e.g., MS Teams or [COMPANY_004] WebEx). Live image transmission is fully encrypted and 
protected for authorized user. By [CONTACT_860312], it will be assured that data will 
be viewed only but not transmitted/stored.  
• FSP/Local CRO CRAs not using [COMPANY_004] laptops, only MS Teams via Remote Access 
Application may be used for meetings between the CRA and the site. WebEx is not 
permitted from non -[COMPANY_004] laptops. Other tools like FaceT ime, WhatsApp or Zoom are 
not permitted since they do not have sufficient encryption features. [COMPANY_004] does not 
have enterprise contract/privacy agreement with these providers.  
• Prior to the remote monitoring visit, the CRA instructs study site on the specific data 
needed for the remote SDV.  
• Source data verification will be conducted according to the process outlined in the 
Monitoring SOP.  
• The use of a headset is required, do not use computer audio.  
• The CRA does not capture screens or take pi[INVESTIGATOR_860270].  
• WebEx or Teams do not store or have access to any data, [COMPANY_004] staff is not allowed to 
make or store any screenshots or save any data which has been shared.  
• Details of what was monitored remot ely will be documented in the appropriate 
section of the Monitoring Visit Report.  
• In case of technical malfunctions or if the security of the transmission is no longer 
ensured, we will pause rSDV activities. [COMPANY_004] Issue Management Procedures will be

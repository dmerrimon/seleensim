03/01/[ADDRESS_534051] across the lifespan .2–[ADDRESS_534052]  is associated with  markedly elevated risk for depression5 with epi[INVESTIGATOR_422799] (CM)  account  for as much as 30% of depression 
onsets in the population2,[ADDRESS_534053] experienced CM show poor treatment response and 
high risk for relapse across interventions,7,9–[ADDRESS_534054] not been investigated.  
 
A history of CM exposure may increase risk for depression via altered neurodevelopment of the positive 
valence system  (i.e., reward processing) .[ADDRESS_534055] circuitry and behaviors . 
 
Behavioral Activation (BA) is an evidence -based treatment for adult and adolescent depression13–15 that uses 
an individualized  approach to identify and foster behaviors within an adolescent’s  context that increase 
rewarding experiences and decrease avoidant behaviors that contribute  to depression symptom severity and 
maintenance . This is the first study to investigate BA as an alternative , target -focused  approach to treat 
depression among a dolescents  with a history of CM  exposure .  
 This proposal will  examine whether BA  intervention  reduces depression and anhedonia in a sample of 
depressed adolescents, aged 13- 18, with variable histor ies of CM exposure (BA Group ). A total of 30 
depressed adolescents will be recruited to undergo a 12-week course of BA . All participants will undergo 
clinical assessment to measure depression symptoms and anhedonia at baseline (Week 0) and post - (Week 
12) treatment . 
  
Participant Table  Inclusion Criteria  Exclusion Criteria  
BA Group  n=30  1) Age 13- 18; 2) major or minor 
depression ( PHQ ≥10).  1) IQ<80; 2) non -English speaking; 3) current 
PTSD; 4) developmental, neurological, psychosis, 
bipolar, or substance disorder; 5) No legal 
guardian;  6) current psychiatric medication; 7) 
suicidality requiring higher level of care.  
 
 
Study  Aims:  
Aim 1: Determine baseline and post -BA treatment depression and anhedonia  symptoms  among depressed 
adolescents  with variable histories of CM . 
 Exploratory Aim: Evaluate whether  changes in self -reported  anhedonia or  other  indicators of reward 
processing as measured by [CONTACT_422800]-report are differentially 
associated with reductions in depres sion following BA  in youth with versu s without CM exposure . 
 
Data Analyses : Across all analyses: primary outcomes will be measured as 1) depression and anhedonia 
symptoms . Aim 1. Determine baseline and post -BA treatment depression an d anhedonia  symptoms  
among depressed adolescents  with variable histories of CM . Means and standard deviations in 
depression (PHQ -9) and anhedonia symptoms (BADS) will be measured at baseline and post -treatment follow-
up. 
 
Exploratory aim . Evaluate whether  changes in self -reported  anhedonia or  other  indicators of reward 
processing are differentially associated with reductions in depres sion following BA  in youth with versu s without 
CM exposure . Participants completed  morning, afternoon, and evening EMA  surveys  twice a  week  over 14 
weeks  (n= 84 timepoints) . Measures assesse d depression  symptoms, CM exposure, and  reward 
processing/responsiveness  across BA treatment . Using the lavaa n package in R8, we plan to conduct  Latent 
Growth Modeling (LGM)  to test the associations between changes in reward processing and depression 
symptoms with CM as a fixed moderator.  Covariates will include  age, sex,  and socioeconomic statu s.

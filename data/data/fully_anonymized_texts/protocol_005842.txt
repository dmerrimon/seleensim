Title: Selection process and evaluation of endourology fellows 
Grant Number:
Study Description: While ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy (URS) is a well-established 
operative technique, new modalities exist with regards to laser energy 
in URS. This study will attempt to quantify the degree of renal damage 
associated with different intraoperative variables by [CONTACT_186956] a safety 
profile for different intraoperative variables during URS.
Objectives*:Primary Objectives: 
1) To determine if during ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy, laser type 
(Ho:Yag Moses 2.0 vs Thulium Fiber Laser) predicts differences in renal-
damage associated biomarkers
Secondary Objectives: To determine if any additional operative 
factors (i.e. operative time, patient positioning, use of 
pressurized irrigation, use of a ureteral access sheath) predict 
differences in levels of renal-damage associated biomarkers.
Endpoints*:Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoints will be: 
1) Determination of association between type of laser used 
during URS and degree of renal damage (as measured by 
[CONTACT_186957]).
Secondary Endpoint: The secondary endpoint will be the 
determination of association between additional operative variables 
(see secondary objective) and renal damage during URS.
Study Population: Specify the sample size, gender, age, demographic group, general health 
status, and geographic location.
We anticipate a sample size of 100 subjects enrolled in this study. We 
will not discriminate by [CONTACT_547], demographic group, or general health 
status.  All patients will be over the age of 18 years and from the 
general [LOCATION_001] area.

hereafter referred to as “study intervention”). Include intervention dose 
(length and frequency) and how it will be administered. Include method 
of delivery (e.g., group vs. individual, web-based, etc.).
Subjects enrolled will undergo surgical treatment of their kidney stones 
with URS based on clinician judgement and urologic guidelines. Once 
enrolled, patients will be randomized into one of two groups based on 
the type of laser used to break apart the stones: Thulium Laser or 
Hol:YAG Laser. Both lasers are used routinely and interchangeable for 
this procedure according to the standard of care. The only involvement 
of patients will be collection of urine samples before and after surgery.
Study Duration*:Estimated time (in months) from when the study opens to enrollment 
until completion of data collection.

Participant Duration: Time (e.g., in months) it will take for each individual participant to 
complete all study-related tasks.
[ADDRESS_220896]. Gupta has introduced the study and the 
patient agrees to learn more. Once informed consent has been achieved, patients will be randomly 
placed into one of two groups that will indicate which type of laser lithotripsy they will receive: 
1) Hol:YAG laser
2) Thulium laser
Effective Date: 1/10/2023
End Date:1/9/2024

41.3 SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES 
After randomization, the patient will undergo URS using either the Thulium or Hol:YAG laser. 
Both lasers are used as part of the standard of care and are used interchangeably. At the 
beginning of all procedures, the surgeon will empty the bladder and collect a 2 mL sample of 
urine that will serve as the “Preoperative Urine Sample”. It is the standard of care to collect 
urine at the beginning of the surgery to send to pathology. The only deviation is that a portion of 
the urine will be for research. One hour following the end of the procedure, a member of [CONTACT_186972]’s research team will collect a second 2 mL sample of urine that will serve as the 
“Immediate Post-Op Urine Sample”. This will be collected using the catheter that was placed 
during surgery. If no catheter was placedb the patient will provide the urine sample. 
After collection, the samples will be subsequently frozen in a freezer at -[ADDRESS_220897] and final sample of urine will be collected at the patients’ 10-day follow up appointment 
for stent removal which will serve as the “Follow-up Urine Sample”. To standardize the duration 
in which the last urine samples are collected, only patients who have been stented will be 
included in the study, as standard of care for stent removal is ten days. Upon receiving the third 
and final specimen [ADDRESS_220898]’s enrollment will be considered 
complete. All procedures and appointments are the standard of care.
After sufficient patient enrollment and specimen collection, all the samples will be analyzed for kidney 
and urothelial injury biomarkers using urinary assays (ELISA, CLIA, etc.). The biomarkers that will be 
qualified and quantified in the urine include Cystatin C, Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1), Neutrophil 
gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), Beta-2-microglobulin, Microalbumin urine, spot creatinine, total 
protein, and glycosaminoglycans.
2 INTRODUCTION
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE 
State the problem or question (e.g., describe the population, disease, current standard of care, if one exists, 
and limitations of knowledge or available therapy), the reason for conducting the clinical trial and the 
rationale underlying the intervention. State the name [CONTACT_186971], the hypothesized 
target(s) of the intervention (i.e., the putative cognitive, affective, behavioral, social, community, 
Effective Date: 1/10/2023

5organizational, etc., target necessary to produce the behavior change relevant to the clinical outcome), 
and the clinical outcome of interest.
Standard operations used for the surgical removal of kidney stones include ureteroscopic laser 
lithotripsy (URS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).  In recent years new modalities have 
been introduced to both URS and PCNL including new laser technologies such as the Thulium laser 
and antiretropulsion properties with Holmium lasers (Moses technology).  While the overall safety 
and efficacy of these procedures has been well established, these relatively new modalities have yet 
to be rigorously studied for potential deleterious effects on the kidney.  To date, several studies 
have attempted to use these biomarkers to determine degree of tissue injury after kidney stone 
operations, however these studies have been limited by [CONTACT_186958] [1-6].  This study is intended to determine 
whether different intraoperative variables (type of laser, patient positioning, renal pelvis pressure) 
correlate with renal damage, as measured by [CONTACT_186957].
2.[ADDRESS_220899] common urologic conditions with a lifetime incidence in the United 
States approaching 10% and rising [7].  While many kidney stones will pass spontaneously, a significant 
portion ultimately require surgical intervention in the form of ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy (URS), 
percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) to eradicate the stone burden.  
The ideal surgical procedure for eradication of kidney stones would have maximal efficiency in stone 
removal while minimizing collateral damage to the renal parenchyma and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_186947] (urothelium). While much is known about the physical properties of stone 
fragmentation techniques, relatively little is known about the unwanted effect these techniques may have 
on renal tubular and urothelial cells.
In daily practice, clinicians almost exclusively use a patient’s estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 
obtained by [CONTACT_186959] a biomarker of renal parenchymal injury.  The drawbacks of 
using serum creatinine as a surrogate for renal function are well known.  First, serum creatinine can 
change with many confounding variables that are unrelated to kidney function such as diet, hydration 
status, and muscle mass to name a few.  More importantly, serum creatinine (eGFR) is considered more 
a measure of global renal function and has a poor sensitivity for detecting early or small insults to renal 
tubular cells.  In other words, eGFR does not change in any detectable way until a relatively large insult to 
the kidney has taken place.  Lastly, eGFR is a better measure of renal blood flow and is not a direct marker 
of cellular injury.  In recent years, several urinary protein biomarkers have been found that are now known 
to be markers of renal cellular injury.  When compared to eGFR, these markers can detect renal insults 
earlier and have significantly higher sensitivity.  Indeed, they can be used as early predictors of impending 
acute kidney injury (AKI) [8].

tubular cells and urothelium.  In this study, we will quantify urinary biomarkers specific for kidney and 
urothelial injury before and after URS and correlate these markers to different intraoperative variables.  
We postulate that our results will shed a new light on urological endoscopic procedures.
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
2.3.[ADDRESS_220901]. Gupta’s surgical patients. Surgical intervention and 
follow up for kidney stones will be performed regardless of a patient’s willingness to participate in this 
study according to the standard of care.  Since we will be storing patient samples and data, there is a small 
risk that personal data will be compromised.  This risk will be mitigated by [CONTACT_186960], which will be separately linked to the patient’s 
protected health information.
2.3.[ADDRESS_220902] involves 
collection of three perioperative urine samples (collected via cystoscope, Foley catheter, or clean void).  
No invasive procedure will be performed to collect the samples (for example, a Foley catheter will not 
be placed solely for the purpose of collecting a urine sample for this study).

3.1 OVERALL DESIGN
The overall design is to evaluate the degree of renal damage caused by [CONTACT_186964].  Pre- and postoperative urine samples will be collected from 
subjects to quantify urinary biomarkers which are specific for renal damage.
Subjects enrolled will be randomized into two arms, one in which subjects will undergo laser lithotripsy 
with the Thulium fiber laser (TFL), and the other in which the procedure will be performed with the 
Holmium:YAG laser.

8Randomization by [CONTACT_186965].  We chose to do this as this would eliminate any potential 
bias on the part of the surgeon for preference of one laser type over another. Both lasers are used 
interchangeable during URS for kidney stones, and surgeons do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_186948] a specific laser to use 
prior to surgery.  We believe that from the subjects’ standpoint, there is little to no perceived difference 
in use of TFL or Ho:YAG lasers, and both are used interchangeably as standard of care.

5 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)
5.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S) ADMINISTRATION
5.1.1 STUDY INTERVENTION OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION DESCRIPTION
For subjects receiving URS, randomization will occur preoperatively.  These subjects will be randomized 
to undergo lithotripsy with either Ho:YAG or TFL lasers (100 subjects in each arm).
All subjects will undergo surgical interventions that abide by [CONTACT_186966], allowing for slight variations in technique as seen necessary by [CONTACT_186967]. Gupta.
The type of laser that is chosen in SOC is based on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186949]. That is, most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186950] (and that laser type is generally contingent on the biomedical contracts the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186951]). We are uniquely situated at Mount Sinai West in 
that we have multiple laser systems to choose from. Multiple surgeons share the lasers, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_186952]. 
Gupta will use whichever laser is already in the room or readily available. Approximately 50% of 
ureteroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_186953], +/- 10%.
5.[ADDRESS_220905]. Gupta is a world-renowned expert in these operative techniques.
5.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING
Patients will be randomized to receive either Thulium or Holmium laser lithotripsy.  Patients will be 
blinded as they will be anesthetized during the operation.  Blinding of the operators would not be possible 
owing to the differences in laser modalities.
We will utilize random.org which is a validated tool that utilizes atmospheric noise to generate random 
numbers. Each enrolled patient will be given a subject ID (1-108, consecutively assigned) and these study 
IDs will be entered as string of integers to random.org and randomized prior to the initiation of the study. 
Effective Date: 1/10/2023
End Date:1/9/2024

10This process will determine group assignments. This will ensure both true randomization and equal 
allocation… The laser systems are bulky and require transfer into and out of the operating room 
preoperatively as the OR staff prepares for the upcoming case. Thus, though it only takes a few minutes 
to actually switch the laser systems, we tend to use the laser that is already in the operating room. The 
purpose of randomization is to remove this ‘last case’ bias and ensure equal distribution of laser the 
modality used.

PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
6.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION
No discontinuation will take place as the surgical procedures being performed are part of subjects’

128 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
8.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES
After sufficient patient enrollment and specimen collection, all the samples will be analyzed for 
kidney and urothelial injury biomarkers using urinary assays (ELISA, CLIA, etc.). The biomarkers 
that will be qualified and quantified in the urine include Cystatin C, Kidney Injury Molecule-1 
(KIM-1), Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), Beta-2-microglobulin, Microalbumin 
urine, spot creatinine, total protein, and glycosaminoglycans. 
Abundance of each kidney injury biomarker for each laser will be analyzed using the Kruskal-
Wallis statistical test. Multiple multivariate regression will also be used to control for stone size, 
operative time, and other potential confounders.
8.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION
A sample size of 108 patients will be accrued locally. We are enrolling 108 patients to allow for any 
potential exclusions due to failure to follow up or for patients who were not stented. 
A study by [CONTACT_186968]. prospectively evaluated urinary Kidney Injury Marker-1 (uKIM-1) levels in patients 
undergoing kidney stone surgery to compare the effect of Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy (ESWL) 
and Ureteroscopy/Laser Lithotripsy (URS) on biomarkers of renal damage1. In this study, the 50 patients 
in the ESWL arm had a mean preoperative uKIM-1 of 5.78ng/mL (SE=0.8) and the 10 patients in the URS 
arm similarly had a mean preoperative uKIM-1 of 5.78ng/mL (SE=2.0). Two hours post operatively, the 
ESWL group had a mean uKIM1 of 10.14ng/mL (SE=1.4) and the URS group had a uKIM-1 of 5.49ng/mL 
(SE 0.7, SD=2.21). Another study by [CONTACT_186969]1 in 11 health controls and 53 patients 
with varying degrees of kidney disease and found a -0.37 correlation (p=0.016) between uKIM-1 levels 
and eGFR.2 That is, a 1ng/mL rise in uKIM1 correlated to a 0.37mL/min decline in eGFR. The purpose of 
our statistical analysis is to evaluate for non-inferiority of the two laser modalities in regard to occult 
kidney damage. Given that kidney stone disease is a recurrent illness often requiring multiple surgical 
interventions over the course of a patient’s lifetime, we defined non-inferiority as producing a change in 
eGFR 1mg/mL). With an allocation ratio of 1:1, 99% power, non-inferiority limit of 40%, and alpha of 5%, 
using the noninferiority power calculation, our sample size is 49 patients in each study arm for 98 patients 
in total (~100). Based on these calculations and factoring in a 10% dropout rate, we seek to enroll 108 
total patients.

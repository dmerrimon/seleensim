values.[ADDRESS_687587] been shown to vary by 
[CONTACT_124940].124,125 We found that there are no ethnic differences among Puerto Rican, 
African-American, and Afro-Caribbean children with asthma on symptom perception 
accuracy using the proposed methodology or in response to our PEF prediction with 
feedback intervention.14We will recruit participants from general medicine and 
pulmonary outpatient clinics in the Mount Sinai Health System, at Jacobi Medical 
Center, and Montefiore Medical Center.
3.Study Design:
a) Recruitment Methods (see PPHS policy):
Potentially eligible participants will be identified through monthly queries of the
patient registration systems. The RAs will obtain permission from physicians to
contact [CONTACT_156999]. Emergency Department (ED) Recruitment: ED recruitment
will increase enrollment of individuals who may use the ED as their usual source of
care. RAs will query the ED's electronic registration system and will monitor the
asthma treatment areas to identify potentially eligible patients. Once a potential
participant is identified, the RAs will obtain permission from the ED physician and
follow the steps described above. Please note that subjects will not require consent
from a Primary Care Provider separate from their ED provider in order to
participate in the study.
We will recruit and introduce the study to participants using the following steps:
oObtain approval from physician. Physicians will be asked if we may
approach all the eligible patients under their care, if we may approach a
patient under their care on a patient-by-patient basis, or not approach their
patients. We will contact [CONTACT_529180]' pulmonary care. A physician's decision
will be documented by [CONTACT_5640] a signed Physician Approval Form or via
email.
oResearch team approaches patient. There will be no "cold contact" of
potential participants. Participants will first receive a letter which will
introduce them to the study and give them the opportunity to opt out. If they
do not choose to opt out, ten (10) days after the letter was mailed, an RA
will approach the patient over the telephone. RAs will use an IRB approved
recruitment script. If the patient is interested in the study, the RA will
confirm that they meet eligibility criteria. Patients who screen eligible will
be offered participation and schedule the baseline interview. On the day of
the baseline, the RA will meet with the subjects and administer the

oParticipants interested in the study who would like more information before
deciding to enroll will be provided with an informational brochure, which
includes an overview of the study as well as the research team's contact
[CONTACT_3031].
b) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:
At Mount Sinai the eligibility screening process will begin with reviewing the medical
records of potentially eligible patients identified by [CONTACT_529182]. Patients who are
eligible based on their medical record will be contact[CONTACT_529183]. If
the patient is reached over the phone, the RA will verify the patient's age, asthma history,
and that the patient does not meet exclusion criteria. A HIPAA waiver has been obtained
for this study.
At the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, patients are first contact[CONTACT_529184]. If the patient is reached over the phone, the RA will verify the patient's age,
asthma history, and that the patient does not meet exclusion criteria. At that point, then
medical records are reviewed to confirm that the person is eligible.
Inclusion Criteria:
a. Age greater than or equal to 60 years
b. English or Spanish speaking
c. asthma diagnosis made by a health care provider
Exclusion Criteria:
a. Diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) or other chronic
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375];
b. Smoking history greater than or equal to 15 pack-years (to exclude undiagnosed
COPD);
c. dementia;
d. moderate or severe cardiac disease (including [LOCATION_001] Heart Association stages 4
or 5 congestive heart failure, because dyspnea among patients with severe heart
failure is more likely to be attributable to their heart condition than their asthma);
e. dependence on assistance for medication administration since we are focused on
SMB;.
f. uncorrectable visual impairment since the cognition assessments require vision

f) Data Storage, Transmission and Confidentiality:
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMSS) will serve as the data-coordinating
center. The study teams at ISMMS, Jacobi Medical Center and Montefiore Medical Center
will work together on recruitment. The teams at all sites other than ISMMS will recruit
participants from their sites only and will only have access to data from their site. Once the
data is collected, those teams will send the de-identified data to the Mount Sinai team, who
will then combine that data with the data from Mount Sinai participants
g) Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:
For projects with a Data Safety Monitoring Board/Data Safety Committee
(DMSB/DMC):
Brief description of the DSMB: The DSMB will be formed before the pi[INVESTIGATOR_529166]. 
We will convene a DSMB to oversee patient safety for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_529167] 3. The board will consist of a primary care physician, a pulmonologist, a 
biostatistician, and a behavioral health research scientist. The board members will meet 
prior to implementation of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_529168] 1. Study Timeline

Revised 8/31/2020events are adequate. They will then meet every 6 months after implementation of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_529170], including the following elements: recruitment rate, study withdrawal, 
reasons for withdrawal, adverse events, impact of intervention on beliefs and behaviors.
Qualifications of DSMB members:  The DSMB will consist of a primary care physician, a 
pulmonologist, a biostatistician, and a behavioral health research scientist. The board will 
not serve as co-investigators on the study. A DSMB chair will be identified and will 
convene the board every six months to review the study and accumulated data.  
Role and Responsibilities of the DSMB:  The DSMB is an independent group advisory to 
the MPIs and is required to provide recommendations about starting, continuing, and 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098].  In addition, the DSMB is asked to make recommendations, as 
appropriate, to the MPIs about:
Efficacy of the study intervention
Benefit/risk ratio of procedures and participant burden
Selection, recruitment, and retention of participants
Adherence to protocol requirements
Completeness, quality, and analysis of measurements
Amendments to the study protocol and consent forms
Participant safety
Notification of and referral for abnormal findings
The DSMB will monitor patient safety, consider new scientific or therapeutic 
developments that could impact safety or trial ethics, and make recommendations to 
continue, terminate, or modify the trial based on interim analyses.  The DSMB will 
specifically review: 1) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278986]; 2) study disenrollment unrelated 
to death; 3) any patient, caregiver, and healthcare provider concerns.  The DSMB may 
recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_529171]. 
Adverse events will include disruption of previously established regular care such that the 
patient’s health is jeopardized or excessive burden created by [CONTACT_279020].  The DSMB can recommend changes in study protocol or 
termination of the study if it concludes the study design causes disruptions in patient-
provider continuity which jeopardized the health of the study subject or if the study 
imposes excessive burden on patients.  Finally the DSMB, at the request of the sponsor, 
will review accrual and evaluate study progress towards meeting recruitment targets.

Revised 8/31/2020The DSMB will review safety and data information every 6 months. Should a temporary or 
permanent suspension of the study occur, in addition to the PPHS, we will report this to 
NIH.
h)For other projects with greater than minimal risk a monitoring plan must be provided:
N/A
i) Withdrawal of Subjects:
Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. Participants may
withdraw through written or phone request to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_529172].
The principal investigator, the sponsor or the institution may stop the participant's
involvement in this research study at any time without consent. This may be because
the research study is being stopped, the instructions of the study team have not been
followed, the investigator believes it is in the participant's best interest, or for any other
reason. If specimens or data have been stored as part of the research study, they too can
be destroyed without the participant's consent.
4. Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury:
Participants will be at minimal risk and have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. 
Members of the research team are bilingual, so outside interpreters will not be needed for 
recruitment, data collection, or coding. As in prior studies, we will include questions at the end of 
this survey to identify participants at risk of harm or worsening health. Those participants 
identified will be referred to a designated social worker (individuals with acute needs) or services 
available in the community. Since issues of patient safety are inherent in assessments for 
depression, we created protocols that will be in place for research staff to follow, should a patient 
endorse and/or be found experiencing suicidal ideation, whether with plan and intent or not. If 
patients with suicidal ideation are identified, this protocol requires that the PIs and/or a senior 
psychology/psychiatry staff member are notified and based on the patient’s presentation and 
history a determination is made as to whether the patient is safe to participate in the study and/or 
whether a formal consult for psychiatric care is necessary. We will also adhere to these protocols 
at each follow-up contact. Participants who screen positive for depression but do not have suicidal 
ideation will be given a list of counseling sites serving their community and offered referral for 
psychological counseling at the research sites.

Revised 8/31/2020During spi[INVESTIGATOR_68333], participants will be instructed to alert staff if they feel lightheaded or 
dizzy. Those who report symptoms will be promptly instructed to discontinue the test and sit 
down. A physician will be available at all times to assess the patient if symptoms persist.
5. Recordings:
Will any video or audio recordings be made for research purposes? Yes
All audio and video recordings will be accessible only to the research team and will be stored
on or secure drive. Any recordings transmitted between sites will be sent securely via
OneDrive.
Data will be stored for 7 years following the completion of data analysis.
Research staff will inform the participant before beginning the interview if they intend to
record and will ask the participant for permission before recording. If the participant does not
wish to be recorded, they may still participate in the interview and the session will not be
recorded.
6. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects:
To protect the privacy interests of subjects, all communications with study subjects will be via face-to-
face visit, HIPAA compliant zoom, telephone or email. Phone messages left will not refer the study in
which they are enrolled but only the site where they were enrolled. For example, we would leave a
message such as, "This is XXXX calling from Mount Sinai." Patients will be asked whether they
prefer phone contact [CONTACT_529185]-up.
Protection of subject privacy. To preserve patient confidentiality, study subjects will be assigned code
numbers. Using these codes, none of the collection forms will contain the names or medical record
number of the patients or other personal identifiers. There will be a master list at each institution
matching the names of the patients to the code numbers. The list will be safely stored in secure
network drives.  Paper-based consent and HIPAA documents will be stored in locked cabinets within
locked offices, separate from the master lists.  All electronic data will be stored on mainframe servers,
and terminals and Tablet PCs will be password protected and maintained in locked offices.
Database protection. Patient information will only be accessible to the MPIs, project manager, and
research coordinators associated with the research. Data collected on Tablet personal computers (PC)
will be uploaded on a daily basis to mainframe servers supported by [CONTACT_529186].  These data will lack personal identifiers other than a study
identification code.  Following the upload, the data on the Tablet PCs will be deleted.  Encrypted data
from the JMC and MMC sites will be transferred electronically to Mount Sinai, which will serve as
the data coordinating center, on a weekly basis. The transferred data will be free of personal data that

Confidentiality during adverse event reporting. Adverse event reports and annual summaries will not 
include subject-identifiable material. Each will include the coded identification number only.
7. Economic Impact on Subjects:
No cost, besides transportation costs associated with in-person study visits, are expected. 
8. Payments/Reimbursements to Subjects:
Study participants may receive up to $310 for participating in the study. Study participants 
will receive $50 via cash or money order after the completion of the baseline interview. An 
additional $20 will be given to the participants after they return the electronic monitoring 
device for the medication  and the electronic peak flow meter. Participants will receive $40 
in cash/money orderafter the completion of each follow-up interview (6 months and 12 
months). An additional $20 will be given to the participants after they return the electronic 
monitoring device for the medication and the electronic peak flow meter after each follow 
up interview.  In addition, if participants participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], they we will receive 
$20 in cash/money order after the completion of the first interview (12.5 month visit) and 
$30 for each of the follow-up interviews (14 months and 15 months). An additional $20 
will be given to the participants after they return the electronic monitoring device for the 
medication and the electronic peak flow meter after each pi[INVESTIGATOR_529173]. Payment for each 
interview and device return is not contingent upon the completion of the entire study.  
Study participants will be paid in cash/money order for returning their devices at the next 
visit unless otherwise requested. If patients receive a device at the 15-month pi[INVESTIGATOR_529174] (or any other visit if they choose to withdraw before completing the study), they 
will be paid by [CONTACT_529188].
9. Consent Process:
Written or verbal informed consent will be obtained from each subject at entry into the
study. Written informed consent is obtained by [CONTACT_38733]:
oSubject reviews the study consent form.
oMPIs or research delegates speak with the subject to review the consent, confirm
subject’s understanding, and answer any questions.

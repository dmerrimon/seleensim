 4 SYNOPSIS 
Study Title  A Phase 1b/2a , Safety, Pharmacokinetic, Dose -Escalation Study of KD019  
in Subjects With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease  
Number of Study 
Centers  Approximately 10–13 sites in the [LOCATION_002]  
Clinical Phase  Phase 1b/2a  
Study Rationale  Tesevatinib (formerly named KD019) was originally developed for a solid 
tumor indication, and is currently being investigated for the treatment of 
cancer.  In nonclinical studies, tesevatinib  selectively inhibited key kinases 
and validated targets in animal models of polycystic  kidney disease (PKD) .  
In addition, it has shown either no or extremely weak inhibitory activity of 
other kinases that should reduce off -target effects.   Tesevatinib  has also  
been shown to be a potent inhibitor of receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine 
kinases (TKs) .  The product was specifically optimized to simultaneously 
inhibit EGFR, human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2), Src, 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR 2/ KDR ), and ephrin  
receptor  B4 (EphB4 ) tyrosine  kinases with high potency, and demonstrated 
excellent activity in target -specific cellular functional assays .  In 
nonclinical animal models, tesevatinib  had acceptable oral bioavailability 
and has shown sustained inhibition of its targets in vivo  following a single 
oral dose.  
In Phase [ADDRESS_776653] been treated to date; at lea st 
[ADDRESS_776654] been treated at levels ≥ [ADDRESS_776655] received  tesevatinib  for ≥ [ADDRESS_776656] 
cancer and non-small cell  lung cancer ( NSCLC ).    
In summary, both the nonclinical results in PKD models and the clinical 
safety results in human oncology studies suggest that tesevatinib  could be a 
promising therapeutic in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 
(ADPKD ). 
Study Objective s Phase 1b:  
Primary objective:  
 To determine the safety , plasma pharmacokinetics  (PK) , and 
maximum tolerated dose  (MTD) of tesevatinib  when administered 
to subjects with ADPKD.  
Phase 2a:  
Primary  objective : 
 To evaluate the annualized change in  glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) in subjects with ADPKD when treated with tesevatinib .

 Secondary  Objectives :   
 To evaluate subjects treated with tesevatinib  with regard to:  
o Annualized percent change from baseline in total kidney 
volume (TKV)  
o Annualized change from baseline in the reciprocal of serum 
creatinine  
o Safety profile  
o Serum creatinine levels  
o PK and tolerability of 2 alternative dosing schedule s (dosing 
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week , and dosing 
on Monday and Thursday of each week ) 
Note: Exploratory measures of efficacy will also be performed throughout 
both phases of the study.  
Study Design  This is an open -label, safety, PK, dose -escalation , multicenter study.  
Study Method ology  In the Phase 1 b portion  of the study, a pproximately 24 –30 subjects 
(8 subjects/cohort) have receive d 50 mg, 100  mg, or 150 mg of  tesevatinib  
orally once daily  for up to 24 months .   
At the end of each dosing cohort, a Data Safety Committee, which include s 
an independent safety monitor with clinical expertise in polycystic kidney 
disease , review ed all safety data (PK, safety labs, ECGs, echocardiograms, 
and adverse events [AEs] ) and decide d whether dose escalation may occur .  
Dose escalation to the next higher dose w as not started until the safety data 
from the preceding dose cohort was evaluated and deemed acceptable.  
Specifically, the decision to progress to the next higher dose w as made after 
the safety data through a minimum of [ADDRESS_776657] 8  subjects in the preceding dose cohort and it was determined 
that it was safe to proceed to the next dose level . 
Dose escalation to the next planned tesevatinib  dose cohort  will be 
reviewed and dose adjustments may be made if any of the following safety 
criteria are met:  
 ≥ 25% of subjects in a cohort experience  a severe  (or higher) 
related  AE in the same organ or body system  
 Any other related  AE occurs in a subject that is deemed by [CONTACT_589694] 1b subjects dosed with 50 mg/day:  Following review of the 
100-mg cohort it was initially determined  that 100 mg/day was not the 
MTD . Study enrollment was opened at the 150 -mg dose, and subjects 
initial ly treated in the Phase 1b 50-mg dose cohort had the option of 
increasing their dose of tesevatinib  to 100 mg/day after they had received a 
minimum of 6 months of treatment at the 50 mg/day dose.  
After  the MTD for daily dosing  was established  (100 mg QD) , 
KD019  Protocol Number KD019 -[ADDRESS_776658] in additional studies  in 
ADPKD .  In order to generate additional efficacy and safety information 
for this selected dosing regimen , 15 additional subjects were  enrolled as an 
additional group in the Phase 2a portion of this protocol at a dose of 50 mg 
daily of tesevatinib. Each of the 15 subjects were required to complete 
either PK testing as described for other Phase 1b subjects in this protocol or 
iothal amate testing.    
Modeling of ADPKD subpopulations for a randomized Phase 3 clinical 
study  has been performed.  Enrollment criteria being considered for Phase 
3 are ADPKD subjects with baseline eGFR ≥ 35 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≤  80 
mL/min/1.73 m2, and  height -adjusted  total kidney volume ( htTKV) ≥ 1000 
mL.   
In order to study the safety profile in this specific ADPKD subpopulation, 
up to 50 additional subjects with PKD and baseline eGFR ≥ 35 
mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≤ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2, and htTKV ≥ 1000 mL will be 
enrolled  (Safety in Larger Kidneys [SILK Cohort] ).

may confound the study results.  
Study Drug  Tesevatinib is a new chemical entity that inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases 
(TKs) ErbB family members [EGFR and HER2/ErbB2], vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor  [VEGFR2/KDR]), and Src family 
kinases.  
Dose and 
Administration    In the Phase 1 b portion of the study, tesevatinib  will be administered orally  
at doses of  50, 100, and 150  mg once daily.  Study drug may be  taken with 
or without  food, and should be taken at approximately the same time every 
morning .  Subjects should drink a full glass of water (approximately 
8 ounces [240 mL]) immediately after study drug administration.  In the 
Phase 2a  portion of t he study , tesevatinib will be administered  on 
alternat ive dosing schedule s of 150 mg of tesevatinib  on Mo nday, 
Wednesday, and Friday of each week  or 150 mg on Monday and Thursday 
of each week .  Additionally, subjects active in the Phase 1b  portion had 
their dose increased or decreased to the established MTD  of 100 mg daily 
(continuing once -daily administration) . 
 If subjects are unable to be seen in clinic on the appropriate protocol 
specified study day, the schedule may also be Tuesday and Friday or 
Wednesday and Saturday.  However, the same schedule must be adhered to 
throughout the study.      
Based on all information generated thus far, the [ADDRESS_776670] in 
additional studies  in ADPKD .  In order to generate additional efficacy and 
safety information on this selected dosi ng regimen, 15  additional subjects 
were enrolled as an additional group in the Phase 2a portion of this protocol 
at a dose of 50 mg of tesevatinib.  Up to 50  additional subjects, with eGFR 
≥ 35 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≤ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 and htTKV ≥ [ADDRESS_776671], or investigator decision.  Subjects will be provided 
with an adequate supply  of and instructions for taking the study drug .  
Study drug accounting will be performed at each visit.   
Duration of 
Treatm ent Subjects will receive study drug for 28 days after the initiation of treatment .  
After the initial 28 -day safety and tolerability assessment period , subjects 
will, at the investigator’s discretion,  continue to receive study drug for a 
total of [ADDRESS_776672] dose of tesevatinib .   
Concomitant 
Medications  Subjects should avoid ingesting  grapefruit, pomelo , or Seville fruit (and 
juice ) with tesevatinib  or at any time during the study.  Subjects should not 
take medications that are associated with a risk of QTc( F) interval 
prolongation and/or torsades de pointes.  Additionally, subjects are not 
permitted to take concomitant medications that inhibit the CY P3A4 
isozyme (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin) or 
inducers (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], or 
phenobarbital) .  Tesevatinib  is also highly protein bound, and other drugs 
that are also highly protein bou nd with the exception of warfarin  (eg, 
diazepam, furosemide, dicloxacillin, propranolol, and phenytoin) should be 
avoided .   
Antiemetics and antidiarrheal medications should not be administered 
prophylactically before initial treatment with study drug. At the discretion 
of the investigator, treatment of symptoms with antiemetic and 
antidiarrheal medications may be undertaken per standard clinical practice.  
Since tesevatinib  is a potent inhibitor of MATE transporter proteins, 
increased levels of concomitant medications that are secreted by [CONTACT_589695].  Thus , subjects  taking cephalexin, cimetidi ne, dofetilide, 
fexofenadine, metformin, procainamide , and pyrimethamine should be 
monitored carefully . 
Safety Assessments  Safety assessments will be perform ed at regular study intervals (r efer to 
Study Assessment t able) and include AEs, physical examinat ions, vital sign 
measurements, clinical laboratory evaluations  (especially renal function) , 
ECGs, echocardiograms, concomitant medication , and pregnancy testing.  
The AE reporting period for a subject enrolled in the study will begin after 
informed consent through [ADDRESS_776673] dose of tesevatinib .  
Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation ,

 and thyroid -stimulating hormone  [TSH ]) will  include the following:  
 Hematology will include complete blood count (CBC) with 
differential, and platelet count.  CBC includes red bloods cells 
(RBCs), hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and white blood cells (WBCs) 
with diffe rential count to include neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, 
lymphocytes, and monocytes.  
 Clinical chemistry will include albumin, amylase, alkaline 
phosphatase, ALT, AST, bicarbonate, BUN, calcium, chloride, 
creatinine, creatinine phosphokinase, lactate d ehydrogenase, 
potassium, random glucose, sodium, total & direct bilirubin, total 
protein, and magnesium .  GFR will be estimated using the MDRD -4 
formula , the CKD -EPI 2012cys  equation,  and CKD -EPI 2012Scr -cys 
equation . 
 Peripheral blood smears for analyses of any effect on bone marrow  
 Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, 
glucose, ketones, bilirubin, urobilinogen, pH, color, appearance , and 
specific gravity.  
 Coagulation  tests will include PT , PTT,  and INR . 
 Creatinine clearance  and cystatin C  level s.   
 TSH levels will be evaluated at Screening and then every 3 months.  
Vital sign  measurements  will include sitting blood pressure, pulse rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature  (oral or tympanic) . 
Cardiac safety will be determined by [CONTACT_2224] [ADDRESS_776674] should be rechecked within 1 –[ADDRESS_776675]  corrected  visual acuity and will be evaluated with  
fundoscopic exam with non -dilated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], slit lamp photography of the 
iris, non-mydriatic photography of retina withi n the arcade , ,and optical 
coherence tomography (OCT)  of the op tic nerve head and macula .  All 
ocular assessments should also be conducted at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, [ADDRESS_776676]  not already completed  in the study (Months 3,6, 9, 12, 18 , and 24).    
The initial data from the Phase 1b portion of this  study (Protocol 
KD019 -101) indicate that subjects  with ADPKD may have elevations of 
creatinine without elevations in cystatin C.  This appears to be due to 
inhibition of MATE transporter proteins by [CONTACT_589696] , which should be 
reversible.  To demonstrate the reversible nature of the creatinine 
elevations, subjects on the Phase 1b portion of the study will have study 
drug held for a one -time drug holiday of at least [ADDRESS_776677] weekly blood draws during 
the drug holiday period and during the 4 weeks immedia tely following the 
drug holiday period.  These samples will be collected and analyzed for 
serum creatinine and cystatin C and plasma tesevatinib levels.  
In order to provide definitive data on renal function that is independent of 
creatinine or cystatin C m easurements, iothalamate testing of renal 
clearance will  be conducted at selected sites.   In the Phase 2a 50 mg daily 
cohort  of patients , only those subjects who can undergo iothalamate or PK 
testing will be enrolled.  In addition, eGFR will be calculated using serum 
creatinine, serum cystatin -c, and using both serum creatinine and cystatin -c 
(CKD -EPI 2012Scr -cys; see Appendix A for equation ). 
Pharmacokinetics  During the P hase 1b and Phase 2a 50 mg daily portion s of the  study, blood 
samples will be collected for PK analyses on Study Day  1 (predose, 1, 2, 4, 
8, and 24 hours postdose ), Day 14 (predose, 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours postdose ), 
and predose on D ays 7, 21, and 28 .  Additional samples will be collected 
predose at every monthly visit thereafter up to and including the Month 6 
visit for those subjects who continue dosing .   
In the Phase 2a portion of the study, approximately 70 subjects (5 in each 
alternative dosing schedule  and 15 subjects in the 50 mg daily dosi ng 
schedule  and 50 subjects in the SILK cohort ) will have blood samples 
drawn for PK analyses.   
For subjects receiving 150 mg of KD019 on Monday, Wednesday, 
and Friday:   Samples  will be collected on Study Day 1 (predose, and 
1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours postdose) ; predose  on Days 3, 5, and 8 ; and on

the Mont h 6 visit for those subjects who continue treatment (Follow -Up 
Treatment Period).   
For subjects receiving 50 mg of tesevatinib daily (the SILK cohort):   
Samples will be collected on Study Day 1 (predose, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours 
postdose), Day 14 (predose, 1,  2, 4, and 8 hours postdose), and predose 
on Days 7, 21, and 28.  Additional samples will be collected predose at 
every monthly visit thereafter up to and including the Month 6 visit.  
In addition, blood samples for PK analyses will be collected if the QTc( F) 
interval increases by > 60 msec above average predose value (average of 
Day 1 predose and screening values) or to the level of ≥ 480 msec .   
Exploratory Efficacy  In the Phase 2a Cohort:  
 Evaluate the 6 -month annualized change in GFR.  
 Evaluate the annualized change from baseline in the reciprocal of 
serum creatinine  
 Evaluate the annualized percent change from baseline in total 
kidney volume  (TKV).  TKV will be determined by [CONTACT_589697] (baseline measurement) , at the 6-month visit , and every 
[ADDRESS_776678] and a reasonable sample size  for 
determination of safety and tolerability in this Phase 1b/2a  study .  In the 
Phase  2a cohort , 24 subjects were  enrolled at the MTD  using alternat ive 
dosing schedule s of 150 mg of tesevatinib on Monday, Wednesday, and 
Friday of each week , or 150 mg of tesevatinib on Monday and Thursday of 
each week. There were 15 additional  subjects in the Phase 2a cohort  dosed 
at 50 mg of tesevatinib daily  and up to 50 additional subjects  are planned .  
These  subjects who receive 50 mg daily of tesevatinib will provide 75% 
likelihood of having at least 1 AE if the true incidence of an AE is 5%.   
Demographic (eg, gender, age, race) and baseline characteristi cs (height, 
weight ) will be summarized by [CONTACT_589698] . 
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive any quantity 
of tesevatinib .  Data generated from safety assessments will be presented in 
listings by [CONTACT_589699] t reatment cohort  with the Phase 2a 
cohort being analyzed separately .  Treatment -emergent AEs will be 
summarized using version 18.1 or higher  of MedDRA  System Organ Class 
(SOC) and preferred term, classified from verbatim terms .  The incidence 
and percentage of subjects with at least [ADDRESS_776679] severe intensity .  The number of 
events per preferred term will also be summarized.   
Causality (relationship to study treatment ) will be summarized separately .  
ECG (QT/QTc[F ]) and PK data will be provided in a prospective statistical 
plan that will detail the statistical method of analyzing the ECG data and 
morphological findings .  
KD019  Protocol Number KD019 -[ADDRESS_776680] of tesevatinib  on eGFR .  
In the Phase 2a cohort, the 65 subjects in the 50 mg QD dose group will 
allow an 80% confidence interval of approximately ± 0.64 mL/min about 
an expected mean 6 -month change from baseline of -2.5 mL/min when the 
standard  deviation is 4.0 mL/min. Additional statistical details will be

b. Vital sign measurements consist of sitting blood pressure, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral or tympanic temperature.  O n Day 1 measurements should be 
performed predose and 1 and 4 hours postdose.  For subjects particip ating in PK, vital signs also are also to be measured 8 hours postdose on Day 1.  See Section 9 for 
appropriate blood pressure measuring technique.      
c. Supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 12 -Lead ECGs will be performed at Screening, predose, and 1 and 4 hours postdose on Days 1 and 25; predose on Day 11 and Day 1 of Months 2 and beyond; 
and at End-of-Study visit  (repeat 3 times consecutively within 30  minutes [must have an inter val of at least 1 -2 minutes between ECGs]) .  For subjects participating in 
PK, ECG s also are to be performed 8 hours postdose on Days 1 and 25.  If QTc(F)  is prolonged to >  60 msec above baseline at any evaluation or to the level of ≥ 480 
msec , refer to Se ction  [IP_ADDRESS]  for procedure to be followed.   
d. Clinical laboratory tests consist of hematology, serum chemistry panel, coagulation, and urinalysis ( see Section 9.[ADDRESS_776709] of assessments).  (Need not be 
repeated if screening visit occurred within 4 days prior to Day 1 visit.)   
e. Ocular  evaluations are to be performed at Screening and at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 . The following assessments should be performed: evaluation of best 
corrected visual acuity, slit lamp photography of the iris, non -mydriatic photography of retina within the arcade, pi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the 
optic nerve head and macula.  
f. Optional; to be conducted at selected sites in 3 –[ADDRESS_776710] 2 mont hs of study drug dosing and after 
consultation with the medical monitor.  
g. Urine pregnancy tests are to be done in women of childb earing potential at Screening, predose Day 1, Day 25, at Month 3 (and every 3 months through Month 12), 
and End-of-Study visit s only.  For subjects continuing on study past [ADDRESS_776711] visits every 2 months, testing should be done every 2 month s to coincide 
with their visit schedule. Confirm with serum testing if urine sample is positive.   
h. Subjects will start Phase 2a with an alternat ive dosing schedule of 150 mg on Monday and Thursday of each week.  
i. In the Monday/Thursday dosing schedule of the Phas e 2a portion of the study, approximately [ADDRESS_776712] nearly been met, only those who can undergo iothalamate or PK testing will be enrolled.  Blood will be collected on Study Day 1 (predo se, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 
and 24 hours postdose); predose on Days 8, 11, and 18; and on Day 25 (predose, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours postdose) , and  predose at every monthly visit thereafter 
(up to and including the Month 6 visit) (Subjects undergoing iothalamat e testing will not undergo PK sampling.)  Also, collect PK sample if QTc(F)  interval increases 
by > 60 msec above average baseline or to the level of ≥ 480 msec (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
j. Screening must occur within [ADDRESS_776713] dose of study drug is administered.  
k. All protocol -specified clinic visits during the Treatment Period should occur within ±  1 day of the nominal visit day unless otherwise specified.  
l. This visit is for subjects partic ipating in PK sampling only.  
m. Follow -up Treatment Period visits to be performed monthly (± 3 days) for the first [ADDRESS_776714] is on study.  Thereafter, F ollow -up visits are to be performed 
bi-monthly (every 60 ± 3 days).  For those subjects continu ing on study beyond 12 months, visits will occur every 2 months .  See Section 9.6 for study assessments 
to be performed and the timing of visits.  
n. End-of-Study visit is to be performed 30 days (± 3 days) after last dose of study drug .  
o. Echocardiograms are to be obtained at Screening, on Day 25, at Months 3 , 6 and every 6 months thereafter, and at End -of-Study visit and are to include measurement 
of ejection fraction  and assessment of pericardial effusion . Note:  If subject has had echocardiogram within [ADDRESS_776715] should be rechecked within 1 –3 months to monitor for 
progression.

 5 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
5.1 Polycystic Kidney Disease 
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the most common inherited kidney disease in the [LOCATION_002], 
occurring in approximately 1 in every 1,000 live births.  It affects more than 600,000 people in the 
[LOCATION_002] and 12 million worldwide (Wilson, 2004).  It is the third most common single cause 
of
 kidney failure.  
Polycystic kidney disease is characterized by [CONTACT_589702], which cause 
abnormalities in both structure and function of the kidneys.  Cysts also develop in other organs, 
particularly in the liver.  Other manifestations of polycystic kidney disease include high blood 
pressure, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, hematuria, and aneurysms.  Pain in the back, 
a
bdomen, and pelvis affects many PKD patients. 
There are 2 types of polycystic kidney disease, autosomal dominant (ADPKD) and autosomal 
re
cessive (ARPKD).  In the more common form, autosomal dominant PKD, the abnormal PKD 
gene (PKD1 or PKD2) is inherited from [ADDRESS_776724] be 
contributed by [CONTACT_589703].  Parents are usually 
unaware of being carriers of the mutant gene because they are asymptomatic. 
ADPKD is caused by a mutation in either the polycystin 1 or 2 (PKD1 or PKD2) genes, resulting in 
the abnormal, uncontrolled growth of renal tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (Chapman, 2008). In individuals 
with ADPKD, e
pi[INVESTIGATOR_5168] (EGFR) is overexpressed and mislocated from the 
basolateral to the luminal surface of renal tubular cells (Torres et al, 2007). EGFR ligands are 
secreted by [CONTACT_589704]. The combination of EGFR 
mislocation and ligand secretion establishes an autocrine loop resulting in persistent renal tubular 
cell proliferation (Torres, 2010). Chronic proliferation results in renal cyst formation (Belibi et al, 
KD019  Protocol Number KD019 -101 
Amendment Number 13  
  
 
   
Kadmon Corporation  Page 40 of 148 
Confidential and Proprietary  06 October  2016  
 
 2004 ). The cysts then cause a structural distortion of the renal architecture, impeding normal 
nephron function. Cyst enlargement results in a massive increase in kidney volume and a 
progressive impairment of renal function (Grantham et al, 2006). Associated clinical symptoms 
include hypertension, recurrent flank pain, hematuria, and recurrent pyelonephritis. Currently, there 
are no disease-modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_589653]; all existing treatment strategies are palliative and 
aimed at controlling symptoms (Grantham, 2008). 
5.2 T esevatinib 
Tesevatinib (formerly named XL647 and KD019) is a new chemical entity that inhibits multiple 
t
yrosine kinases (TKs) (ErbB family members [EGFR and HER2], vascular endothelial growth 
fa
ctor receptor 2 [VEGFR2/KDR]), and Src family kinases. 
5.2.1 T esevatinib Nonclinical Toxicology  
Tesevatinib nonclinical toxicology has been characterized in multiple species using a variety of 
dosing regimens. Details can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
5.2.2 Clinical Experience with KD019 
Tesevatinib has been evaluated in over 300 subjects, including 195 subjects with solid tumor 
malig
nancies in 3  Phase 1  studies,  3 Phase 2 studies, and 1 Phase 3 study; 66 healthy volunteer 
subj
ects in 4 clinical pharmacology studies ; a nd 64 subjects with polycystic kidney disease (in this 
study, KD019-101).  In these studies, at least [ADDRESS_776725] been treated at levels ≥ [ADDRESS_776726] 53 subjects were treated with tesevatinib for ≥ 6 months.  The MTD was 
de
termined to be 300 mg once daily.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Daily Ad ministration 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Phase 1 
In the daily dosing Phase 1 study XL647-002, “A Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety and 
P
harmacokinetics of KD019 Administered Orally Daily to Subjects with Solid Tumors,” 
31 subjects were enrolled in successive cohorts to receive tesevatinib as a single oral dose daily. 
S
ubjects continued to receive tesevatinib on study in the absence of unacceptable tesevatinib -
related toxicity or progressive disease (PD). The MTD was determined based on dose-limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) occurring in the first 28 days of treatment. Tumor imaging was conducted at 
baseline and approximately every 2 months thereafter while subjects received study drug.

 A total of 31 subjects were treated across 5 dose levels: 75 mg (n = 3), 150 mg (n = 3), 200 mg 
(n = 3), 300 mg (n = 18), and 350 mg (n = 4). One DLT of Grade 3 drug-induced pneumonitis was 
obser
ved at 300 mg, resulting in expansion of the 300 mg cohort to a total of 6 subjects. Two of 4 
subjects enrolled at 350 mg experienced a DLT of Grade 3 QTc(F) prolongation (machine read), 
both clini
cally asymptomatic. These events were downgraded to Grade [ADDRESS_776727] common adverse events (AEs) considered either possibly or probably related to 
tesevatinib (frequency ≥ 10% of subjects) reported were Grade 1 and 2 diarrhea, dysgeusia, fatigue, 
ra
sh, and clinically asymptomatic QTc(F) prolongation. One subject receiving a 300 mg daily dose 
of
 tesevatinib experienced 2 serious adverse events (SAEs) of Grade 3 drug-induced pneumonitis 
a
nd Grade 4 myocardial infarction,  which were both assessed by [CONTACT_589705]. Two additional subjects experienced SAEs assessed by [CONTACT_589705]: clinically asymptomatic Grade 3 QTc(F) prolongations (machine read), subsequently 
downgr
aded to Grade 2 following digital re-read by a validated central ECG laboratory (also DLTs, 
see above). 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Phase 2 
I
n the Phase 2 study, “A Phase [ADDRESS_776728] Progressed after Responding to Treatment with Either Gefitinib or Erlotinib” 
(XL647-203), 41 subjects with relapsed or recurrent NSCLC (Stage IIIB or IV) with documented 
pr
ogressive disease after benefit from single agent erlotinib or gefitinib, including stable disease 
(SD), or with a known EGFR T790M mutation were enrolled to receive tesevatinib, [ADDRESS_776729] frequently reported AEs were diarrhea, nausea, 
coug
h, dry skin, and ECG QT prolonged.  Adverse events that occurred in ≥ 10% of subjects and 
were considered related to tesevatinib consisted of diarrhea, rash, dry skin, fatigue, cough, and 
e
lectrocardiogram QT prolonged. The majority of these events were Grades [ADDRESS_776730] experienced 
Gr
ade 3 diarrhea (2 occurrences), Grade [ADDRESS_776731]: Grade 4 bilateral pulmonary emboli, 
Gr
ade 3 ventricular ectopy (in a subject with a history of atrial fibrillation and MI), and Grade 3 
QTc(F) prolongation (based on machine-read value). Two deaths were reported during the course 
of the study (within [ADDRESS_776732] dose of study drug), both of which were assessed as not 
related to study drug (tesevatinib).  Both deaths were reported to be due to progressive disease.   
[IP_ADDRESS] In termittent Administration 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Phase 1 
In the Phase 1 study, “A Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of 
KD
019 Administered Orally to Subjects with Solid Tumors” (XL647-001), subjects with advanced 
solid tum
ors were enrolled in successive cohorts to receive tesevatinib orally daily on Days 1-5, 
followe
d by a 9-day break, with cycles repeating every 14 days. This regimen is referred to as the 
“
intermittent 5 & 9” schedule. Tumor imaging was conducted at baseline and approximately every 
2 months thereafter while study drug was being received. Subjects were allowed to stay on study in 
the absence of unacceptable tesevatinib -related toxicity or progressive disease. 
In this study, a total of 41 subjects were treated across 11 dose levels. Subjects received study drug 
a
s either a powder- in-bottle (PIB) formulation at 0.06, 0.12, 0.19, 0.28, 0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 3.12, 4.68, 
and 7.0 mg/kg, or a fixed-dose tablet formulation of [ADDRESS_776733] in the 3.12-mg/kg cohort 
ha
d a DLT of asymptomatic QTc(F) prolongation, resulting in expansion of that cohort, with no 
fur
ther DLTs. The first 2  subjects who received 7.0 mg/kg experienced DLTs of Grade 3 diarrhea, 
de
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2391], requiring dose reduction to 4.68 mg/kg. The reduced dose was well tolerated in 
both of the
se subjects. Expansion of the 4.68-mg/kg cohort to 6 subjects occurred without further 
D

 Phase 2 
In this study “A Phase 2 Study of KD019 in Subjects with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,” 
(
XL647-201), selected subjects with NSCLC of adenocarcinoma histology, Stage IIIB, with 
malignant pleural effusion, or Stage IV were enrolled to receive 350 mg of oral tesevatinib daily on 
Days 1-5, followed by a 9-day break, with cycles repeating every 14 days. Subjects with clinical 
cha
racteristics predictive of response to EGFR inhibitors (Asian, female, and/or minimal and 
remote smoking history) were enrolled. Tumor imaging was conducted at baseline and 
approximately every [ADDRESS_776738]
ay on study in the absence of unacceptable tesevatinib -related toxicity or progressive disease.  
A total of 41 subjects were enrolled in the intermittent 5 & 9 dosing cohort. The majority of AEs 
reporte
d were Grade 1 (71.0%) or Grade 2 (22.5%) and the most frequently reported AEs were 
diar
rhea, fatigue, nausea, rash, and cough. The most frequently reported Grade 3 AEs were pleural 
e
ffusion (experienced by 4/41 [9.8%] subjects), diarrhea, and electrocardiogram QT prolonged 
(each experienced by 3/41 [7.3%] subjects). Grade 4 pulmonary embolism was reported for 
3/41 (7.3%) subjects.  A total of [ADDRESS_776739] experienced SAEs of Grade 3 
gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage and duodenal ulcer, and the following SAEs were experienced by 
[ADDRESS_776740] each: Grade 3 pneumonia, Grade 2 hemoptysis, and clinically asymptomatic Grade 3 
QTc
(F) prolongation (machine-read, downgraded to Grade 2 following digital re-reads by a 
va
lidated central ECG laboratory). 
A second cohort in this study enrolled 14 subjects to receive KD019 orally daily at a dose of 
300 mg. The majority of AEs reported in this cohort were Grade 1 (68.3%) or Grade 2 (22.2%). 
The
 most frequently reported AEs with daily dosing were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, rash, and 
cough.  The most frequently reported Grade 3 AEs were diarrhea, electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged, and pleural effusion (each reported by 2/14 subjects, 14.3%).  Thirteen SAEs were 
reported in 6 of the 14 subjects. Three SAEs were assessed by [CONTACT_589707]019  Protocol Number KD019 -101

*[ADDRESS_776741] safety criteria for defining the MTD, this dose level was considered intolerable for long-
ter
m administration in this population. Therefore, the MTD for daily dosing was determined to be 
100 mg
 daily.  While the MTD dose of 100 mg/day was based on criteria defined in the protocol, 
the oc
currence of moderate QTc prolongation in 2 subjects dosed at that level led to a decision later 
in the study to recommend 50 mg/day as the best tolerated daily dose. 
As the known toxicities of tesevatinib, including diarrhea and rash, have been seen in all [ADDRESS_776742] population.  The safety data 
of
 the 14 subjects who received 150 mg tesevatinib every Monday, Wednesday and Friday has 
bee
n reviewed by [CONTACT_589708].  There were 3 moderate events: [ADDRESS_776743] had 
moderate QTc(F) prolongation which resolved with dose modification as well as moderate 
diar
rhea, and [ADDRESS_776744] with moderate rash which improved with topi[INVESTIGATOR_589654].  While the tolerability of this schedule appears to be superior to that of dosing 
tesevatinib 150 mg on a daily schedule, another dosing schedule of tesevatinib 150 mg 
a
dministered on Monday and Thursday of each week was explored to determine if this dose and 
schedule would result in fewer moderate toxicities, particularly QTc(F) prolongation.  To date, of 
the 
10 subjects receiving 150 mg Monday and Thursday, there was no QTc(F)  prolongation ; 
however, [ADDRESS_776745] had a severe (Grade 3) ma culopapular skin rash.  Thus , while the [ADDRESS_776746] of 
missing any single dose in this regimen, has led to the decision to further evaluate the dose level of 
50 mg
 daily prior to using this dose in a randomized study. 
F
ollowing the enrollment of the additional 15 subjects in the Phase 2 50 mg dosing cohort, it was 
concluded that tesevatinib 150 mg in various schedules was associated with skin rash that was not 
well tolerated.  Incidence of moderate QTc prolongation not acceptable for chronic use was 
associated with tesevatinib 100 mg daily.  Tesevatinib 50 mg daily appeared to be a well-tolerated 
dose in patients with ADPKD, although some acneiform rash occurred.  The study will enroll 
a
pproximately 50 more subjects at the dose of 50 mg daily in order to increase the robustness of the 
sa
fety data in subjects with ADPKD treated with tesevatinib.    
The initial data from this study (Protocol KD019-101) indicate that subjects with ADPKD 
receiving tesevatinib have experienced elevations of creatinine without elevations in cystatin C.  
The median changes from screening values for creatinine and cystatin C from all 9 subjects in the 
50-mg dose cohort reveal that creatinine values were increased by 7.5% at Day 3, by 22% at Day 7, 
and incr
eased by 13% at Day 28.  Data after Day 28, including [ADDRESS_776747] received 
teseva
tinib for 16 months, do not indicate any significant ongoing change in creatinine.  Cystatin C 
leve
ls, during the same time periods, did not change (median decreases of 4.5%, 1%, and 4% at 
Days 3, 7, and 28, respectively).  Data from the 8 subjects enrolled into the 100-mg dose cohort, as 
we
ll as subjects enrolled in subsequent cohorts, exhibit ed a similar pattern.  This increase in

 creatinine occurs early and after approximately 7 days, does not continue to increase, similar to the 
incr
ease in serum creatinine seen with cimetidine.  Increases in creatinine were seen in previous 
clinical studies of tesevatinib.  For example, increases in serum creatinine in 10% of subjects were 
re
ported in Study XL647-201.  However, most of the previous studies were in subjects with 
malignancies, and in previous studies, cystatin C levels were not evaluated, so increases in serum 
creatinine that may not represent renal dysfunction were not recognized.   
In order to further investigate the effects of tesevatinib on serum creatinine levels, the effects of 
tesevatinib on a panel of transporter molecules (including OCT2 and MATE ) we re evaluated in 
vitro.  Preliminary results indicate that tesevatinib potently inhibits MATE1 and MATE2- K 
transporter proteins.  MATE transporter proteins carry creatinine out of kidney proximal tubule 
cells into the tubule lumen. Inhibition of MATE transporter proteins decreases secretion of 
creatinine into the proximal tubule lumen and leads to an increase in serum creatinine levels.  To 
demonstrate the reversible nature of the creatinine elevations, subjects on the Phase 1b portion of 
the stud
y will have study drug held for a one-time drug holiday of at least [ADDRESS_776748] an independent method of evaluating renal function, 3 –[ADDRESS_776749] been 18 cases of asymptomatic subjects with elevated amylase

discontinuation from the study.  Other subjects with amylase elevations have not had progressive 
KD019  Protocol Number KD019 -[ADDRESS_776754] with a baseline amylase level of 185 U/L had levels 
which continued to rise to a maximum of 365 U/L at Day 110.  While this subject remained 
asymptomatic, with no clinical signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, subjects were discontinued from 
the study.  Both of these subjects with severe amylase elevations had elevations of both lipase and 
pa
ncreatic amylase isozyme.      
P
revious studies of tesevatinib have been reviewed for cases of elevated amylase or pancreatitis.  
Amylase was not routinely evaluated in any of these previous studies.  There was only 1 AE of an 
incr
eased amylase level or of possible pancreatitis.  This was an elevation of amylase to 922 U/L in 
a subject with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer who received tesevatinib at a dose of 300 
mg/day.  The subject was admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_589655], but lipase was 
normal and there were no CT findings consistent with pancreatitis.  On serum amylase isoenzyme 
analysis, the subject had an elevation in salivary amylase.  The investigator’s conclusion was that 
the subject appeared to have an increase in amylase due to salivary amylase secretion by [CONTACT_7879].   
Quantitative Whole Body Autoradiography was performed in rats with C14–labeled tesevatinib.  
Among
 other findings, there was a high concentration (approximately 10 times that found in the 
blood)
 of tesevatinib in the salivary glands and pancreas.  While tesevatinib could concentrate there 
for
 many reasons, it’s at least possible that tesevatinib at high concentrations in the salivary gland 
and pancreas could lead to increased serum levels of amylase.   
In summary, mild asymptomatic increases in amylase levels have been seen frequently during the 
study, including in subjects in the [ADDRESS_776755], evaluation of lipase, amylase 
isoenzymes, and lipid levels are performed.  Ongoing evaluations for the presence of pancreatic 
cysts will be performed using MRIs obtained to evaluate TKV.  There were 28 subjects with 
e
levations of CPK above the normal range.  Twelve subjects experienced moderate CPK elevation 
(> 2.[ADDRESS_776756] – 5.[ADDRESS_776757]), and 3 subjects experienced severe CPK elevation (> 5.[ADDRESS_776758]).  In 
e
ach case of severe CPK elevation, it appeared that the elevation was associated with exercise and 
did not
 recur after rechallenge or continued tesevatinib exposure.  Quantitative whole body 
radiography in rats indicates relatively low accumulation of tesevatinib in skeletal muscle.  In this

 Using non-standardized digital machines that provided an analysis of the data, including QTc(F) 
values, 
12-lead ECG tracings were obtained.  In most of the studies, multiple ECGs were scheduled 
to be ta
ken at tesevatinib concentration nadir and T max, but the timing was not exact in some 
protocols and the conditions were uncontrolled for the effects of diurnal variation, food, or 
concomitant medications. The preponderance of ECG testing was performed during the first 
4-week cycle, but ECGs were obtained during subsequent cycles. The machine RECIST QTc(F) 
int
ervals were recorded directly onto the case report forms. 
CTCAEv3 was used to assign the severity grade for QTc(F) AE s, and the criteria for each grade are 
presented below:

In the 169 subjects with malignancies treated in 4 uncontrolled studies, the majority of whom had 
advanced, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, 33 (20%) were found to have QT prolongation 
based on machine read ECGs at some time during treatment that met the CTCAE v3 definition of

major
ity of these subjects received ≥ 300 mg daily or 350 mg given for 5 days with 9 days off. 
There were no clinical findings associated with the ECG changes. There were no reports of QTc(F) 
prolongation in 32 healthy volunteer subjects who received a single 300 mg dose of KD019. 
Cli
nical study data available for review encompassed Studies XL647-001, XL647-002,

 Digital ECG files from 178 subjects were supplied to a vendor (eRT) for analysis. ECGs from 
[ADDRESS_776769], including all 41 subjects in XL647-203, and an 
additional 19 subjects from XL647-001 (2), XL647-002 (12), and XL647-201 (5), because they 
were reported to have noteworthy QTc(F) prolongation on the ECG machine analysis. eRT then 
re
classified the findings using a different algorithm: 
 Absolute QTc(F) value ≥ 500 msec 

 QTc(F) increase > 60 msec above baseline with QTcF > 470 msec  

 QTc(F) increase > 60 msec above baseline with QTcF ≤ 470 msec  

 QTc(F) value > 470 msec with an increase ≤ 60 msec above baseline  
Of
 these 60 subjects, eRT analyzed the digital files and identified 23 (38%) subjects who had no 
outlier findings, 5 (8%) subjects who had no QTc(F) prolongation on the digital analysis, and 
2 (3%) subjects who eRT could not completely exclude as being product related, but whose 
prolonged QTc(F) value obtained on the machine read ECG was not felt to be measurable due to 
unde
rlying RBBB or atrial fibrillation.  
Of the 30 (50%) remaining subjects, eRT identified 25 with prolonged QTc(F) values of 
≤ [ADDRESS_776770] related. There were 
3 subjects with QTc(F) > 60 msec that were felt to be possibly/probably related to drug treatment 
and 2 subjects who had QTc(F) values > 500 msec, which were felt to be probably related to drug 
trea
tment.  The results of the central laboratory analysis are shown in Table 5-2.

QTc(F)/Concentration Analysis 
A preliminary analysis of delta QTc(F) (change from baseline value) versus plasma concentration 
was carried out using pooled data from studies with intermittent 5 days on and 9 days off dosing 
(Stud
y XL647-001), single doses with crossover food effects (Study XL647-004), and once-daily 
dosi
ng (Studies XL647-002 and XL647-203) regimens. Concentration-matched ECGs were 
available from 1104 records from 125 subjects. This analysis was done using QTc(F) values 
obtaine
d from the central ECG laboratory.  All ECGs digitized and read at a central laboratory and 
QTc(F) values were Fridericia corrected.  The QTc(F) versus concentration relationship was 
described using linear, power, and E max mixed effects models. Using bootstrap population 
pa
rameter estimates pooled across all 3 models (ie, ~ 1000 bootstrap estimates per model). 
Ana
lyses showed that the concentration-QTc(F) relationship appears to be consistent across Studies 
XL647-001, XL647-002, XL647-004, and XL647-203 (ie, suitable for pooling, and argues against 
a marked time effect because XL647-004 is single dose).  In these studies, QTc(F) prolongation 
increased with increasing plasma concentration.  Based on these limited data, the 
concentration-QTc(F) relationship appears to be adequately described using a power model.  In 
order to evaluate potential saturation of QTc(F) prolongation, additional data are needed at 
c
oncentrations > 1000 ng/mL.  At the projected C max (552 ng/mL), the estimated 95% CI on

 QTc(F) prolongation ranges from 34 to 43 msec.  It should be noted that results extrapolated at 
concentrations > 600 ng/mL should be viewed with caution. 
An initial evaluation of QTc duration was performed with data from [ADDRESS_776771]-dosing on 
Day 14 of 11-15 ms.  At the mean C max of 72.5 mg/mL for the pooled 50 mg dose groups, the 
PK/PD model predicted a mean QTcF increase of 13.3 ms, with a one-sided upper 95% confidence 
bound of 16.[ADDRESS_776772] of the tesevatinib 50 mg dose is similar to that

5.4.1 Rationale for the ADPKD Indication 
This study is a Phase 1b/2a, multi-center, open-label, pharmacokinetic, dose-escalation study with 
sa
fety and tolerability as the primary endpoint.  
In nonclinical studies conducted under IND 69,215, tesevatinib has been shown to be a potent 
inhibitor of receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (TKs). The product was specifically 
optimized to simultaneously inhibit the EGFR, human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2), 
Src, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2/KDR ), and ephrin receptor B4 
(EphB4) tyrosine kinases with high potency, and demonstrated excellent activity in target-specific 
cellular functional assays. In nonclinical animal models, tesevatinib had good oral bioavailability 
and has shown sustained inhibition of its targets in vivo following a single oral dose. 
In clinical studies, over [ADDRESS_776773] been treated with tesevatinib in Phase 1 and Phase 2

 In nonclinical studies, tesevatinib selectively inhibited key kinases and validated targets in animal 
models of PKD.  Results from nonclinical efficacy studies demonstrated that  tesevatinib possesses 
significant potential to prevent the formation of cysts due to an increased proliferation of renal 
ductal epi[INVESTIGATOR_272724]. Nonclinical studies using 2 rodent models (BPK mouse and  PCK rat) of PKD 
have demonstrated that tesevatinib reaches its target, the kidneys, and inhibits the signaling pathway 
for MEK/ERK b
y inhibiting the phosphorylation of EGFR (and Src, Erb2, VEGFR2/KDR). The 
de
creased phosphorylation of EGFR and Erb2 contributes towards decreased prolif era tion of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_589657] [ADDRESS_776776] that tesevatinib may be a promising therapeutic for ADPKD.  
5.4.2 Rationale for Dosage Selection  
In the Phase 1b portion of the study, the planned starting dose in this study is 50 mg/person/day 
(a
pproximately 0.83 mg/kg/day). This dose was selected based on the available nonclinical data, 
including no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL), C max, and AUC 0-24 data for rats, dogs and 
monke
ys. In addition, clinical safety and pharmacokinetic data from Phase 1 studies in healthy 
subjects and patients with cancer also support the starting dose. Repeat-dose toxicokinetic studies 
in ra
ts demonstrated a NOAEL of 10 mg/kg for tesevatinib, when administered by [CONTACT_27176] 
14 or 90 days.  The C max and AUC 0-24 measured after the final NOAEL dose in the 14- and 90-day 
studi
es was 138/183 ng/mL and 2013/3433 ng·hr/mL, respectively.  In a third repeat-dose toxicity 
stud
y, 10 mg/kg for 182 days (26 weeks) was considered above the NOAEL of 3 mg/kg, a dose 
a
ssociated with a C max and AUC 0 -24 of 48-61  ng/mL (male-female) and 818-1090  ng·hr /mL (male-
female, respectively).  In the 14-day study,  a C max and AUC 0-24 of 319 ng/mL and 5741 ng·hr/mL, 
(male and female, respectively), for the 30 mg/kg dose was above the NOEL due to generally 
reversible findings consistent with dehydration, inflammation, renal dysfunction, and stress.  In the 
180-day study, a C max and AUC 0 -24 of 175–234 ng/mL (male-female) and 3470-4450 ng·hr/mL 
(ma
le-female), respectively, for the 10 mg/kg dose was above the NOAEL due to toxicities that 
included death or moribund conditions not observed with 10 mg/kg dosing for 90 days in a separate 
toxicity study.  Based on this data, the threshold C max and AUC 0 -24 for adverse effects in rats is 
estimated to be approximately 175 ng/mL and 3470 ng·hr/mL, respectively.

 In non-human primates, the NOAEL for tesevatinib was 2 and 6 mg/kg, when administered for 
14 days by [CONTACT_589713] 26–39 weeks by [CONTACT_589714], respectively.  C max and AUC 0 -24 
for the oral gavage/nasogastric intubation NOAEL doses was (Male-Female) 28– 38/77–70 ng/mL 
a
nd 488–450/1080–995 ng·hr/mL, respectively.  In the 14-day study a C max and AUC 0 -24 of 106 –
116 ng/mL and 1855–1690 ng·hr/mL, respectively, for the 6 mg/kg dose was above the NOAEL 
due
 to findings of QTc(F) interval prolongation, heart rate decrease, and minimal increases in urea 
nit
rogen and creatinine.  It is noteworthy that in the toxicity study, in which the monkeys received 
tese
vatinib for 26-39 weeks, 6 mg/kg was not associated with ECG findings or other findings 
c
onsidered adverse.  Nevertheless, based on this data, the threshold C max and AUC 0 -24 for adverse 
e
ffects in non-human primates is estimated to be approximately 106 ng/mL and 1690 ng·hr/mL, 
re
spectively. 
In a Phase 1 study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of tesevatinib administered to human 
subjects with solid tumors, a dose of 0.78 mg/kg was found to achieve a mean C max (ng/ml) and 
AUC 0
-24 of 38.5 ng/mL and 763 ng·hr/mL, respectively, after a single oral dose on Day 1, and 
125 ng/mL and 2680  after the final dose of a Day 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 dosing regimen.  In a separate 
Phase 1 study in subjects with solid tumors, a single dose of 75 mg tesevatinib was associated with 
a C max and AUC 0-24 of 37 ng/mL and 560  ng·hr /mL, respectively.  Given this data, a starting dose 
of 50 mg/dose (approximately 0.83 mg/kg) in this proposed study is likely to result in a C max and 
AUC 0
-24 below the thresholds for adverse effects predicted from rat and non-human primate 
tox
icity studies discussed above.  Moreover, the C max achieved with a 50 mg/dose in subjects will 
be
 significantly below the C max of 939–1612 ng/mL (male-female) observed in dogs to be the 
NO
AEL for cardiovascular parameters.  With continued daily dosing at 50 mg/dose in subjects, PK 
parameters will approach the thresholds estimated for rats and non-human primates, although 
adverse effects in humans at this dose are still not expected based on prior clinical work.  In 
particular, a total of [ADDRESS_776777] received a single dose of 
tese
vatinib at 6 times the planned starting dose (300 mg/dose) with unremarkable changes in 
clinical safety assessments, including 12-lead ECGs.  C max in these studies reached 158-226 ng/mL.  
Thus, a
 starting dose of 50 mg once daily should be considered a safe starting dose for the planned 
stud
y in subjects with PKD.  
Twenty-two subjects were enrolled into 3 dosing cohorts in the Phase 1b portion of the study: 
[ADDRESS_776778] of the exposure to tesevatinib when compared to daily 
administration.  This modeling takes into account the tesevatinib half-life of approximately 70 
hours.   
Thus , an alternat ive dosing schedule of 150 mg of tesevatinib administered on Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday of each week was explored in the Phase 2a portion of the study to 
determine if it is more tolerable than daily administration when used chronically in this patient 
population.  The safety data of the 14 subjects who received tesevatinib 150 mg every Monday, 
W
ednesday,  and Friday has been reviewed.  There were 3 moderate events: [ADDRESS_776779] had moderate 
QTc(F) prolongation which resolved with dose modification and moderate diarrhea, and [ADDRESS_776780] 
with moderate rash which improved with topi[INVESTIGATOR_589658].  While the 
tol
erability of this schedule appears to be superior to that of dosing tesevatinib 150 mg on a daily 
schedule, another dosing schedule of tesevatinib 150 mg administered on Monday and Thursday of 
e
ach week was also explored to determine if this dose and schedule results in fewer moderate 
toxicities, particularly QTc(F) prolongation.  One subject in the tesevatinib 150 mg Monday and 
Thursda
y cohort had a severe rash. 
PK modeling suggests that reducing the tesevatinib schedule to 150 mg administered on a Monday, 
Thur
sday schedule would reduce the tesevatinib C max slightly while reducing tesevatinib exposure 
more
 significantly.  Thus,  PK modeling predicts a C max and AUC 0-24 of 188 ng/mL and 4120 
(ng
•hr/mL ) for the 150 mg Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule for KD019 administration, and a 
Cmax and AUC 0-24 of 139 ng/mL and 2450 (ng•hr/mL ) for the [ADDRESS_776781] 
profile, particularly the occurrence of QTc(F) prolongation, will be evaluated.

 7 STUDY DESIGN 
7.1 Study Sites 
This study will be conducted at approximately 11 to 13 sites in the [LOCATION_002]. 
7.2 Over view of Study Design 
This is a Phase 1b/2a, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, safety, MTD, and PK study in 
subj
ects with ADPKD.  The Phase 1b portion of the study has been completed and the MTD for 
daily dosin g was determined to be [ADDRESS_776785], at 
the discretion of the investigator, continued  to receive study drug for a total of 24 months from the 
ini

F
or those subjects who had received a minimum of 6 months of treatment at the 50 mg/day dose, 
dose escalation to 100 mg/day was allowed after the 100 mg/day was evaluated for safety. 
After the MTD for daily dosing had been establis hed (100 mg QD), 24 additional subjects were 
e
nrolled in the Phase 2a portion of the study and treated using alternat ive dosing schedules of 
150 mg/day of tesevatinib on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week and [ADDRESS_776786] 1-2 subjects on each of the alternative dosing 
sc
hedules undergo this testing. Also, subjects active in the Phase 1b portion had their dose 
incr
eased or decreased to the established daily dose MTD of 100 mg (while continuing once-daily 
dosing
 to obtain long-term safety data). 
Fifteen additional subjects, consented to Amendment 11, received 50 mg of tesevatinib daily.  All 
subj
ects in this additional cohort were required to participate in either PK testing as described in 
the Phase
 1b cohort summary or iothalamate testing as described for Phase 2a subjects.   
Modeling of ADPKD subpopulations for a randomized Phase 3 clinical study has been performed.  
Enr
ollment criteria being considered are ADPKD subjects with baseline eGFR ≥ 35 mL/min/1.73

 At the end of each dosing cohort, a Data Safety Committee, including an independent safety 
moni
tor with significant clinical expertise in polycystic kidney disease, review ed all safety data 
(PK, sa
fety labs, ECGs, echocardiograms, and AEs) and decided whether dose escalation may 
oc
cur.  Dose escalation to the next higher dose w as not started until the safety data from the 
preceding dose cohort was evaluated and deemed acceptable.  Specifically, the decision to progress 
to the next higher dose was made after the safety data through a minimum of [ADDRESS_776789] 8 subjects in the preceding dose cohort and it was determined that it was 
safe to proceed to the next dose level.   
For those subjects in the Phase 1b portion of the study who had received a minimum of 6 months of 
tre
atment at the 50 mg/day dose, dose escalation to 100 mg/day was allowed after the 100 mg/day 
was evaluated for safety.    
After the MTD for daily dosing had been established (100 mg QD), 24 additional subjects were 
e
nrolled in the Phase 2a portion of the study and treated at the MTD using 2 alternat ive dosing 
schedules of 150 mg of tesevatinib on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week and 150 mg 
on Monda
y and Thursday of each week.  Also, subjects active in the Phase 1b portion had their 
dose 
increased or decreased to the established MTD of 100 mg  (while continuing once-daily dosing 
to obtain long-term safety data).

re
quired to complete either PK testing as described for other Phase 1b subjects in this protocol or 
iothalamate testin g.  Fifteen subjects were enrolled in the Phase 2a portion of the protocol instead 
of the 20 subjects planned.

[CONTACT_589715] 5 mm Hg, additional (1 to 2) readings should be obtained and averaged.  Record cuff 
size, arm used, and subject's position (if not seated).  
At study visits in which a complete physical examination is required, the investigator should 
perform a thorough examination of all body systems (exception: genitourinary and reproductive 
should be symptom-directe d).  At study visits in which a limited physical examination is required, 
the investigator should inquire about signs/symptoms, general appearance , eyes (pupi[INVESTIGATOR_589662], 
ophthalmoscopy, eye movements), oral mucosa, heart and pulses, lungs, abdomen ( live r/spleen), 
kidneys, and neurological (symptom-directed and may include mental state, speech, gait/posture, 
a
rm swinging, facial movements, tongue, muscle wasting (power and tone), coordination, reflexes, 
a
nd sensation.) 
In addition, at each visit, subjects should be assessed for toxicities that may be associated with 
tese
vatinib.  This includes assessing for the following: 
 Pericardial effusions and complications such as cardiac tamponade by [CONTACT_589716], dyspnea, edema, and neck vain distention 
 Ocular toxicity due to photo absorbance at wavelengths between 290 and 370 nm, positive 
phototoxic potential, and distribution into the skin and eye 
 X erostomia due to absorption of tesevatinib in the salivary gland.

on Days 1 and 25 ; predose on Day 11; and on Day 1 of Months 2 and beyond; and at End-of-Study 
visit.  
 Note: An 8 -hour postdose ECG should also be performed for those subjects in either dosing 
schedule of the Phase 2a undergoing PK sampling 
When possible, ECGs are to be performed before any blood sample collection. 
ECGs are to be repeated 3  times consecutively within 30 minutes (must have an interval of at least 
1–2 minutes between ECGs).   
KD019  Protocol Number KD019 -[ADDRESS_776843] with Kadmon. ECGs will be transmitted 
electronically to the central vendor for analysis. Reports, including clinical alerts resulting from the 
analysis of the ECGs, will be provided back to sites. Sites will be trained on the use of the ECG 
machines, and instructions for performing ECG assessments will be provided in the ECG manual. 
The QT interval will be corrected using Fridericia’s formula1: 
 
Refer to Appendix D for sample calculation. 
Prior to enrollment, all subjects must demonstrate an average screening QTc(F) value of 
<
 450 msec by [CONTACT_589718]. Immediate clinical management of subjects will initially be 
based on results of machine-read ECGs at the sites. However, the central digital analysis will 
prevail as it becomes available. In addition, the central digital analysis will be used for any AE and 
SAE documentation. 
An increase in QTc(F) interval (by [CONTACT_589718] ) to a value > 60 msec above baseline or 
to the
 level of ≥ [ADDRESS_776844] may be dose 
re
duced or removed from the study (see guidelines in Section 11.3.3).  
Abnor
malities in the ECG that lead to a change in subject management (eg, requirement for 
additional medication or monitoring) or result in clinical signs and symptoms are considered 
clinically significant for the purposes of this study and will be recorded on the AE eCRF.  If ECG 
abnormalities meet criteria defining them as serious, they must be reported as SAE (see Section 
13.3.1).

In addition, a PK sample should be drawn any time the QTc(F) increases to > [ADDRESS_776849] average predose reading (average of baseline and screening) or to the level of ≥ 480 msec 
(ba
sed on the local ECG read). 
Tesevatinib concentration measurements will be conducted in all plasma samples collected under 
this protocol.  Efforts will be made to identify the specific structure of major tesevatinib 
meta
bolites present in all plasma samples collected from 1– 24 hours after dosing on Days 1 and 14 
of the Phase 1b and Phase 2a 50 mg daily portions and on Days 1, 12, and 25 of the Phase 2a 
portion of the study.  
P
lasma samples will be managed and stored by a central vendor. Detailed instructions for sample 
collection and preparation will be provided in a separate laboratory manual. 
9.14 M agnetic Resonance Imaging for Exploratory Efficacy Assessments 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements will be used to explore the efficacy of 
tesevatinib.  Kidney volume will be determined by [CONTACT_589719] (baseline measurement), at 
the M
onth 6 visit, and every 6 months thereafter.

 The volumes of individual kidneys should be measured in T 1-weighted images with use of a 
stereologic method and calculated from the set of contiguous images by [CONTACT_589720].  htTKV is calculated using total kidney volume 
obtained from MRI divided by [CONTACT_508229].

conducted at selected sites in 3–[ADDRESS_776850] is to be performed as noted 
in Table 4-2 (Monday, Wednesday, Friday dosing) and Ta ble 4-4  (Monday and Thursday dosing).   
Based upon the results of testing, a third timepoint may be performed within the first [ADDRESS_776851] in the study; however, in the event that a 
subject is withdrawn from the study, every effort will be made by [CONTACT_589721].  The reason for termination must be 
clearly documented on the appropriate page of the eCRF.  Study withdrawal should include the 
fina

toxicity/adverse events).  Refer to Table 4-[ADDRESS_776852] Withdrawal (Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]) 
A subject’s participation in the study may be prematurely discontinued for any of the following 
reasons:  
1. Subject self-withdraw al.  
2. R equest by a regulatory agency ( eg, Institutional Review Board). 
3. Safety reasons, eg,  adverse event includ ing, but is not limited to, symptomatic pericardial 
e
ffusion or cardiac tamponade.   
4. S ubject experiences generalized impairment or mental incompetence that would result in 
the subject’s inability to continue in the study. 
5. I f, in the investigator’s medical judgment, further participation would be injurious to the 
health and wellbeing of the subject, or is not in the best interest of the subject.   
6. Admini strative reasons, such as subject non-compliance or protocol violation. 
7. P regnancy 
8. An intercurrent event preventing the administration of tesevatinib for more than 28  days for 
those c

11.1 T esevatinib Administration 
In the Phase 1b portion of the study, tesevatinib will be administered orally at doses of 50, 100, 
a
nd/or [ADDRESS_776856] be adhered to throughout the study.  
S
tudy drug may be taken with or without food at approximately the same time every morning. 
Subjects should drink a full glass of water (approximately 8 ounces [240 mL]) immediately after 
study drug administration.  Grapefruit and similar (pomelo fruit, Seville, etc.) products should be 
avoided for the duration of study treatment. 
Subjects must be instructed not to make up missed doses unless the missed dose can be taken 
within 12 hours of the normal dosing time.  Subjects should not re-take study drug doses in the 
e
vent of vomiting. 
Subjects will receive study drug for 28 days after the initiation of treatment (this will be 25 or 
26 days for subjects on the Monday/Thursday and Monday/Wednesday/Friday cohorts of the Phase 
2a
 portion of the study).  After the initial 28-day safety and tolerability assessment period, subjects 
will

dose of tesevatinib to 100 mg/day after they have received a minimum of 6 months of treatment at 
the 50 mg
/day dose. The participating study centers will be notified (eg, phone, e-mail, telefax) and 
c
onfirmed in writing when accrual to a cohort has been closed.   
Accrual to the next cohort will not occur until the 28-day data from a previous cohort have been 
re
ceived and all safety data have been reviewed. 
At the e
nd of each dosing cohort, a Data Safety Committee including an independent safety 
monitor with significant clinical expertise in polycystic kidney disease will review all safety data 
(PK, safety labs, ECGs, echocardiogram, and AEs).  An independent cardiologist will review all 
ECGs a
nd echocardiograms.  Once all data has been reviewed it will be determined whether dose 
e
scalation may occur.  Dose escalation to the next higher dose will not begin until the safety data 
from t
he preceding dose cohort has been evaluated and deemed acceptable.  Specifically, the 
decision to progress to the next higher dose will be made after the safety data through a minimum 
of [ADDRESS_776859] 8 subjects in the preceding dose cohort and it i s 
determined that it is safe to proceed to the next dose level. 
Dose
 escalation to the next planned tesevatinib dose will be reviewed and dose adjustments may be 
made if any of the following safety criteria are met: 
 ≥ 25% of  subjects in a cohort experience a severe (or higher) related  adverse event in the 
same organ or body system

  Any other related  adverse event occurs in a subject that is deemed by [CONTACT_589723], 24 additional subjects were enrolled in the Phase 
2a portion of the study and treated at 150 mg/day using alternate schedules of tesevatinib 
administration.  As the known toxicities of tesevatinib, including diarrhea and rash, may not be 
tolerable with daily dosing when used long-term in this subject population, alternative dosing 
schedules of either Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week or Monday and Thursday of 
e
ach week were evaluated during this portion of the study.  Additionally, as the MTD for daily 
dosing has been determined to be 100 mg/day, subjects active in the Phase 1b portion had their 
dose 
either increased or decreased to this dose.  These subjects have continued on daily dosing in 
or
der to evaluate long-term tolerability of the daily dosing regimen. 
Drug holiday may start [ADDRESS_776860] been associated with tesevatinib include the following:  diarrhea, skin 
ra

to 
28 days at the discretion of the investigator (unless otherwise specified below), except during the 
fir
st 28 days of treatment in the Phase 1b portion of the study.   
11.3.1 Diar rhea 
Diarrhea should be managed according to accepted practice (eg, with loperamide).  Subjects with 
se
vere diarrhea who are unresponsive to loperamide or who become dehydrated may require 
interruption of study drug until resolution to ≤ mild in intensity.  If subjects are in the month ly

11.3.3
 QT Interval Prolongation 
Acquired long QT syndrome can lead to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, particularly 
torsades de pointes. Risk factors for occurrence of arrhythmia include hypokalemia, 
hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, and concurrent use of multiple medications that prolong the 
QTc(F) interval. In vivo  observations of QTc(F) prolongation in association with use of 
tesevatinib have been observed, including severe QTc(F) prolongation.  However, the lack of a 
c
learly discernible pattern to such occurrence makes prediction of individual subject risk 
diff
icult. Therefore, the following are recommended: 
 Te sevatinib should be administered to subjects who have normal serum potassium and 
serum magnesium levels. 
 Te sevatinib should not be administered to subjects with pathologic bradycardia. 
 Medic ations with potential for QTc(F) prolongation should not be used concurrently or 
star
ted within 24 hours of tesevatinib administration. 
S
ubjects should be carefully monitored for symptoms of arrhythmia (ie, dyspnea, chest pain or 
tightness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dizziness) and for epi[INVESTIGATOR_589665].  An ECG should be obtained if 
these
 symptoms occur. In addition, serum potassium and magnesium must be maintained within 
the normal range (Strevel et al , 2007) and may require additional monitoring or adjustment if 
subjects develop diarrhea. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Response to QTc(F) Interval Prolongation 
The
 following guidelines should be used in the management of QTc(F) prolongation.  Subjects 
will
 have ECGs performed at times designated by [CONTACT_760] (ECGs will be repeated 3 times 
c
onsecutively within 30 minutes [must have an interval of at least 1–2 minutes between ECGs]).

 Protocol Number KD019 -[ADDRESS_776871] use a concomitant medication during the study, it is the responsibility of the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_589667]. 
Subjects should avoid ingesting grapefruit, pomelo or Seville fruit (and juice) with tesevatinib or 
a
t any time during the study.  Subjects should not take medications that are associated with a risk 
of
 QTc(F) interval prolongation and/or torsades de pointes. Additionally, subjects are not 
pe
rmitted to take concomitant medications that inhibit (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
erythromycin, clarithromycin) or induce (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], or phenobarbital) the CYP3A4 isozyme.  Tesevatinib is also highly protein bound, 
a
nd other drugs that are also highly protein bound with the exception of warfarin (e g , diazepam, 
furosemide, dicloxacillin, propranolol, and phenytoin) should be avoided.  
Antiemetics and antidiarrheal medications should not be administered prophylactically before 
initial treatment with study drug. At the discretion of the investigator, treatment of symptoms 
with antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications may be undertaken per standard clinical practice. 
Since tesevatinib is a potent inhibitor of MATE transporter proteins, increased levels of 
c
oncomitant medications that are secreted by [CONTACT_589725].  Thus, subjects taking cephalexin, cimetidine,

12.2 Interaction of Tesevatinib with Other Medications 
12.2.1
 Tesevatinib 
Microsomal oxidation of tesevatinib involves CYP3A4; the percentage conversion of tesevatinib 
in hum
an microsomes was low. This suggests a low potential for other drugs to significantly 
affect the biotransformation of tesevatinib in humans through interaction with CYP-mediated 
meta
bolic pathways.

 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is extensively expressed in multiple tissues and is involved in the transport 
of a vast variety of biological molecules.  It is not possible to screen for all drugs possibly 
influenced by p-glycoprotein but will monitor the main drugs such as colchicine, verapamil, 
tamoxifen, cyclosporine, and digoxin. 
12.2.2 Management of Subjects Requiring Concomitant Medications Associated with 
QT Interval Prolongation 
Tesevatinib has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval. Subjects requiring 
tre
atment with drugs known to be associated with torsades de pointes or significant QT interval 
prolongation may not be enrolled into this study. This includes Class IA antiarrhythmics 
(eg, quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (eg, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide); 
phe
nothiazine anti-psychotics: (eg, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], thioridazine); 
quinolone antibiotics: (eg, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); macrolide antibiotics 
(eg, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin) and other drugs that have a 
contraindication or boxed warning regarding QT prolongation in the prescribing information. 
Appendix B, Concomitant Medications Associated with a Risk of QTc(F) Interval Prolongation 
and/or Torsades de Pointes, contains a partial list of drugs associated with a risk of QT interval 
prolongation and/or torsades de pointes. 
Drugs associated with QT interval prolongation should be avoided in subjects receiving 
study drug. Should a subject develop a condition for which a medication known to affect QT 
int
erval is indicated, consideration should be given to the additive risk of QT interval 
prolongation versus the potential benefit of treatment with the required medication and/or study 
drug.  Contact [CONTACT_589726]. 
Dur
ing the follow-up period, subjects who require short-term (2 to 3 weeks, not to exceed 
21 days) treatment with a concomitant medication associated with QT interval prolongation 
shoul
d have the study drug held until the concomitant treatment course is complete.  The 
de
cision about whether the subject can continue on study following this interruption will be

 13 SAFETY 
13.1 Safety Parameters 
The 5-point Clinical Symptom and Adverse Event Grading Scale will be used for grading 
tox
icities (see Appendix C).  Subjects will be monitored throughout the treatment and follow-up 
period for occurrence of AEs (acute, delayed, and/or cumulative), as well as for changes in 
clinical status, vital sign measurements, and laboratory data.  Safety parameters to be 
measured/assessed include eligibility assessment, medical history, vital sign measurements, 
physical examinations, concomitant medications, hematology, serum chemistries, coagulation 
profiles, peripheral blood smears, renal function (creatinine clearance and cystatin C), urinalysis, 
pr
egnancy testing, ECGs, and echocardiograms.   
13.2 Adver se Event Definition 
An a
dverse event (AE) is defined as any unintended or undesirable, noxious, or pathological 
change, compared to pre-existing conditions, experienced by a subject during a clinical study or 
the follow-up period, regardless of relationship to study drug.  Adverse events include: 
 S uspected adverse drug reactions 
 R eactions from drug overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity 
 S ignificant changes or abnormalities, when compared to baseline, in structure (sign), 
function (symptom), clinical laboratory results, ECG results, or physiological testing.  
This includes any worsening of a pre-existing condition temporally associated with the 
use of study drug 
 Pre- or post-treatment complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated 
procedures 
 P re-existing events, that increase in intensity/severity or change in nature 
 Othe r medical events, regardless of their relationship to the study drug, such as injury, 
surgery, accidents, extensions of symptoms, or apparently unrelated illnesses 
F
or the purpose of data collection, all untoward events that occur after informed consent through 
[ADDRESS_776873] be recorded on eCRFs by [CONTACT_2727]. 
This re
quirement includes AEs from unscheduled as well as scheduled visits.

Amendment Number 13  
 
   
Kadmon Corporation  Page 112 of 148

 An AE does not include:  
 
 Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); 
when the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event. 
 Pre-existing diseases, or conditions or laboratory abnormalities present or detected prior 
to the screening visit, those do not worsen. 
 S ituations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89783], social, and/or convenience admissions). 
 Ove rdose of either KD019 or a concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms, 
unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913]. 
13.3 E valuating Adverse Events 
The investigator will determine the seriousness, intensity (severity), and causality (relationship) 
of a
n AE  associated with the use of the study drug (ie, events where there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]) based on the following 
definitions: 
13.3.1 Serious Adverse Events 
(Notify sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_776874] awareness; document on eCRF) 
The
 SAE definition and reporting requirements are in accordance with the ICH Guideline for 
Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions, and Standards for Expedited Reporting, 
Topic E2A. 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in any of the following 
outcomes, regardless of relationship to study drug: 
 Death:   Any death that occurs while the subject is “on study” as well as any death that 
occurs within [ADDRESS_776875] dose of study drug.   
Note : Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself.  The event(s) that 
caused death ( eg, illness, accident) constitutes the SAE.   
 Life threatening:   Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred (ie, this does not 
include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).

 Protocol Number KD019 -101 
Amendment Number 13  
 
   
Kadmon Corporation  Page 113 of 148 
Confidential and Proprietary  06 October  2016  
 
  Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]: any AE 
requiring in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  A visit to the emergency room or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_589668]-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, it could be considered 
serious if medical intervention was necessary in order to prevent a serious outcome.  
“In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99325], for any length of time. This may or may not be overnight. It does not 
include presentation to and care within an emergency department.  
In the absence of an AE, the investigator should not report hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207456].  Examples are the following: 
o Hospit alization or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410483] a 
procedure required by [CONTACT_760]. 
o Hospit alization or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_589669]. 
o Hospit alization for survey visits or annual physicals. 
I
n addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112044] a pre-existing 
condition which has not worsened would not be considered an SAE. Complications that 
oc
cur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an 
SAE. 
 Persistent or significant disability/ incapacity:   Any substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.   
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Important medical event:   Any adverse event that may not result in death, that may not 
be immediately life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent an SAE outcome.

 13.3.2 Unexpected Adverse Events  
(Notify sponsor or designee by [CONTACT_241565]; document on eCRF) 
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event that is not identified in nature, severity, or 
fr
equency in the current protocol,  IB or in other reports or information provided to the 
investigator.  This refers to any AE that has not been previously observed, (eg, included in the 
I
B), rather than from the perspective of such an event not being anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the product.  For example: hepatic necrosis would be unexpected 
(by [CONTACT_14213]) if the Investigator brochure only referred to elevated hepatic 
enzymes or hepatitis. Unexpected adverse events may or may not be serious. 
13.3.3 Non-Serious Adverse Events  
(Document on eCRF) 
All other AEs, not fulfilling the previous definitions, are classified as non-serious. 
13.3.[ADDRESS_776876] is participating in the study.  For example, a protocol-related AE may be an event that 
occurs during a washout period or that is related to a procedure required by [CONTACT_760]. 
13.3.5 Relationship/Causality to Study Drug 
The investigator will assess the relationship of the event to study drug as (1) not related; (2) 
unlikely related; (3) possibly related; (4) probably related; or (5) definitely related. 
I
n assigning the causal relationship, the following should also be considered:   
 Temporal relationship –  Did the effect occur in a reasonable temporal association with 
administration of KD019? 
 Pattern consistent with known drug effect – Is the effect an expected consequence of 
KD
019 administration based upon the known biologic effects, toxicologic data, and prior 
experience with KD019 or closely related drugs? 
 Othe r potential etiologies –  Is there another more likely cause of the adverse effect?

 Protocol Number KD019 -101 
Amendment Number 13  
 
   
Kadmon Corporation  Page 115 of 148 
Confidential and Proprietary  06 October  2016  
 
  Challenge –  Did the adverse event recur or worsen upon re-exposure to KD019 or upon 
an increase in the dose?  (Note: Intentional re-challenge for the purpose of assessing 
causal relationship of an adverse event to the study drug should NOT be performed.) 
 De- challenge –  Did the adverse event resolve or diminish upon cessation of KD019 
treatment or reduction in dose? 
13.3.6 Recording Adverse Events 
All AEs (including SAEs) are to be accurately recorded on the Adverse Event page of the 
subject’s eCRF and not as remarks elsewhere on the eCRF.  The following aspects of the AE 
must
 be recorded: 
 The onset date and time (when applicable) of the AE 
 I ntensity/severity (per the Clinical Symptom and Adverse Event Grading Scale, 
Appendix C )  
 The  resolution date and time of the AE, when applicable 
 A de scription of the AE 
 An y factors considered as possibly promoting the occurrence of the AE 
 C oncomitant medication/therapy including name, dose, dose frequency, indication, and 
da
tes of use  
 An a ssessment of the relationship/causality by [CONTACT_093]; a decisive factor in the 
documentation is the temporal relationship between the AE and study drug. 
13.3.7 Adverse Event Monitoring and Follow- Up 
The investigator will follow all subjects who experience adverse events until the event has 
re
solved or has stabilized (ie, the subject has returned to the baseline state or the investigator 
doe
s not expect any further improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition).  The 
appropriate follow-up visits must be scheduled and the specific tests repeated or performed as 
nec
essary.  Where a diagnosis is possible, it is preferable to report this diagnosis rather than a 
se
ries of terms (signs/symptoms) relating to the diagnosis.

 13.3.8 Laboratory and ECG Abnormalities 
Note: For the purposes of this study, ECG abnormalities will be handled in the same manner as 
laboratory abnormalities. 
Non-Clinically Significant (NCS) Laboratory  Abnormalities 
All laboratory results must be filed in the subject’s medical record and be monitored. The 
investigator must review laboratory results in a timely manner demonstrated by [INVESTIGATOR_59844]/date 
and assignment of clinical significance assessment.  Non-clinically-significant laboratory 
abnormalities, ie, minor deviations from the normal range, are expected and it is likely that no 
medic
al intervention will be required.  Such results will not be considered to be adverse events. 
Clinically Significant (CS) Laboratory Abnormalities 
C
S laboratory abnormalities will be graded using the CTCAE.  
All severe and life-threatening laboratory result abnormalities and any laboratory abnormality 
that is
 considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_589727].  An abnormal test result will be considered an AE if:  
 I t is not associated with an already reported AE, diagnosis or pre-existing condition 
 The re is a change in concomitant medication or intervention as needed, in direct response 
to the laboratory result 
 The investigator exercises his/her discretion to make significance determinations for any 
subject laboratory result or result that requires intervention 
All such lab abnormalities will be repeated and assessed by [CONTACT_093], or licensed (MD), as 
soon as possible for “seriousness” and if they meet the regulatory definition of “serious”, they 
will be reported as SAEs following regulatory and protocol requirements.  Repeat laboratory 
tests may be run in order to monitor the result.  
Serious Laboratory Abnormalities 
An
y lab abnormality meeting the regulatory definition of “serious” must be recorded on both the 
adverse event eCRF/record and the Serious Adverse Event Form.  If a subject experiences a 
serious toxicity or dies, the FDA will be notified within [ADDRESS_776877] and/or their partner will be followed regularly until birth or termination of the pregnancy. 
The
 pregnancy must be immediately reported to the sponsor. Forms for reporting pregnancies 
will be provided to the study sites upon request. The anticipated date of birth or termination of 
the pregnancy should be provided at the time of the initial report.  The outcome of a pregnancy 
(for a subject or for the partner of a subject) must be reported to the medical monitor as soon as it 
is known. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date initially reported, the 
investigator must notify the Kadmon medical monitor as soon as possible. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets any criterion for classification as a SAE (including 
stillbirth, neonatal death, spontaneous abortion, or congenital anomaly – including that in an 
a
borted fetus) the investigator must follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Any neonatal 
death occurring  [ADDRESS_776878] for prompt reporting is essential in that the sponsor is responsible 
for informing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities as 
well as all other participating investigators of the event.  
Under FDA ruling (US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 CFR Part 312.32) and the ICH 
Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, the sponsor is required to submit written documentation, in the form of a safety 
report, detailing: 
 Any event associated with the use of the drug, that is both serious and unexpected, or  
 Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human 
subjects, including reports o f mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity  
Written submission must be made by [CONTACT_589728] 
a
nd in no event later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial notification of the event.  
The sponsor shall also inform all investigators. 
KD019  
 Protocol Number KD019 -[ADDRESS_776879] be promptly reported (within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of 
the e
vent) by [CONTACT_160240] (or designee).  
I
n the event of an issue with the fax line, forward the SAE form via email to 
[EMAIL_3091] . 
The investigator will be able to contact [CONTACT_589729]: 
        
 
Information to be Provided by [CONTACT_589730]. This requirement includes all SAEs that occur 
after informed consent and through [ADDRESS_776880] number, an event description, SAE term(s), onset date, the reason why the event 
is considered to be serious (ie, the seriousness criteria) and the investigator’s assessment of the 

KD019

 relationship of the event to study treatment (not related, unlikely related, possibly related, 
probably related, or definitely related). Additional SAE information including medications or 
other
 therapeutic measures used to treat the event, action taken with the study treatment due to 
the event, and the outcome/resolution of the event will be recorded on the SAE form. Forms for 
re
porting SAE s will be provided to the study sites. 
In all cases, the investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all 
material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the SAE. Furthermore, the investigator 
may be required to provide supplementary information as requested by [CONTACT_589731]. 
When reporting SAEs, the following additional points should be noted: 
 W hen the diagnosis of an SAE is known or suspected, the investigator should report the 
diagnosis or syndrome as the primary SAE term, rather than as signs or symptoms. Signs 
a
nd symptoms may then be described in the event description. For example, dyspnea 
should not be used as an SAE term if the diagnosis which caused the dyspnea is known to 
be
 malignant pleural effusion.  
 De ath should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE. The cause 
of death is the SAE.  In the exceptional case where the events leading to death are 
unknown, then death may be used as an event term. If an autopsy was performed, the 
a
utopsy report should be provided.  
 W hile most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143190], some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_294708], as follows:  
 Elec tive or previously scheduled surgery, (eg, a previously scheduled ventral 
hernia repair) 
 P rocedures for pre-existing conditions that have not worsened after initiation of 
treatment 
 P re-specified study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486504] 
 Events that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486505] 24 hours and that do not require 
admission, (eg, an emergency room visit for hematuria that results in a diagnosis 
of
 cystitis and discharge to home on oral antibiotics) 
 S AEs must, however, be reported for any surgical or procedural complication resulting in 
prolongation of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

 13.3.11 Regulatory Reporting 
Kadmon Drug Safety (or designee) will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are 
received.  For each SAE received, Kadmon will make a determination as to whether the criteria 
for
 expedited reporting have been met. 
Kadmon (or designee) will submit SAEs that meet the criteria for expedited reporting to the 
Regulatory Authorities in accordance with local regulations governing safety reporting.  
Reporting of SAEs by [CONTACT_486525]. Adequate documentation must be 
maintained showing that the IRB was properly notified. 
13.3.12 Follow-up Information on a Serious Adverse Event 
Appropriate diagnostic tests should be performed and therapeutic measures, if indicated, should 
be instituted.  Appropriate consultation and follow-up evaluations should be carried out until the 
event has returned to baseline or is otherwise explained by [CONTACT_093].   
Follow-up data concerning the SAE (eg, diagnostic test reports, physician's summaries, etc.) also 
must
 be submitted to Kadmon, as they become available, by [CONTACT_589732], until 
resolution of the SAE.

c
onstitute an AE but will be recorded as a protocol deviation.  
13.4.2 Follow-Up of Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE that led to treatment discontinuation (including clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory values that meet these criteria) and is ongoing [ADDRESS_776882] be followed until the event has resolved or has stabilized (ie, the subject has 
re
turned to the baseline state, or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or 
worsening of the subject’s condition).  This follow-up guidance also applies to SAEs that occur 
more
 than [ADDRESS_776883], or investigator decision.  After the MTD for daily dosing had been established 
according to criteria in the protocol (100 mg QD), 24 additional subjects were enrolled in the 
Phase 2a portion of the study and treated using two alternative dosing schedules of 150 mg of 
tesevatinib on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week and 150 mg on Monday and 
Thursday of each week.  While the MTD dose of 100 mg/day was based on criteria defined in 
the protocol, the occurrence of moderate QTc prolongation in 2 subjects dosed at that level led to 
a decision to further evaluate the dose of 50 mg/day.   
Modeling of ADPKD subpopulations for a randomized Phase 3 clinical study has been 
pe
rformed.  Enrollment criteria being considered for Phase 3 are ADPKD subjects with baseline 
eGFR ≥ 35 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≤ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2, a nd htTKV ≥ 1000 mL.  In order to 
stud
y the safety profile in this specific ADPKD subpopulation, up to 50 additional subjects with 
PKD and baseline eGFR ≥ 35 mL/min/1.73 m2, and  ≤ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2, and htTKV ≥ 1000 
mL will be enrolled (SILK Cohort).  Each of the up to [ADDRESS_776884] population.  These subjects who receive 50 mg daily of 
t
esevatinib will provide 75% likelihood of having at least 1 AE if the true incidence of an AE is 
5%.  
 
In the Phase 2a cohort, the 65 subjects in the 50 mg QD dose group will allow an 80% 
confidence interval of approximately ± 0.64 mL/min about an expected mean 6-month change 
fr
om baseline of -2.5 mL/min when the standard deviation is 4.0 mL/min.  
14.[ADDRESS_776885] will be defined as one who has 
c
ompleted 28 days (for subjects in the Phase 2a portion of the study this will be 25 or 26 days in 
the Monda
y/Thursday and Monday/Wednesday/Friday cohorts, and 28 days in the 50 mg daily 
dosi
ng cohort).  Phase 1b unevaluable subjects (subjects who are not evaluable for toxicity) will 
be
 replaced. Subjects who do not complete the study, for whatever reason, will have all available 
data up until the time of termination related to the reason they were terminated included in the 
analysis.  Completion of the study for subjects enrolled in the Phase 1b portion will be defined as 
unint
errupted completion of the first [ADDRESS_776886] demographic information 
a
nd baseline characteristics including PKD traits will be displayed by [CONTACT_3148]. Any 
discrepancy between treatment assigned and treatment received will be accounted for in these 
displays. Data for screen failures, pertaining to why they failed to qualify to enroll will also be 
collected. 
Similar analyses will be presented for the Phase 2a cohort. 
14.3.3 Tesevatinib Exposure  
The
 amount of tesevatinib administered by [CONTACT_560225] (total dose) will be tabulated and 
pr
esented by [CONTACT_589733].  In addition, delays and all other alterations in 
tese
vatinib administration will be presented.  
14.3.4 Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be coded using WHO Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD March 2013, 
Type B2 or later) and the data will be summarized by [CONTACT_589734].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Interim Analyses 
On Study Day 1, subjects will receive their first daily dose of tesevatinib.  During the Phase 1b 
portion of the
 study, all subjects within a dosing cohort must complete 28 days of follow-up and 
the safety data reviewed before subjects from a subsequent dose cohort  receive tesevatinib at the 
ne
xt higher dose.  Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive the starting dose 50 mg tesevatinib (Dose 
Level 1).  After all subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_776887] been reviewed , dose escalation involving new subjects can begin with Cohort 2 
subj
ects receiving 100 mg tesevatinib daily (Dose Level 2).  Similarly, after all subjects in 
C
ohort 2 complete a minimum of 28 days of follow-up and safety data review, dose escalation 
involving new subjects can precede with Cohort 3 receiving 150 mg tesevatinib daily (Dose 
L

interest. 
Similar descriptive statistics will be presented for the reciprocal of serum creatinine endpoints. 
14.3.7 MRI 
Exploratory efficacy analysis will include MRI measurements of kidney volume.  htTKV will be 
calculated using total kidney volume obtained from MRI divided by [CONTACT_508229].  Kidney 
volume will be determined by [CONTACT_589719] (baseline measurement), and every [ADDRESS_776889] has received.  A separate set of safety analyses will be 
pr
esented for the Phase 2a cohort. 
Safety observations and measurements include AEs, safety laboratory tests, vital sign 
measurements, physical examinations, pregnanc y status, echocardiograms, ECG assessments,

personnel will review all data listings for outliers, data inconsistencies, and spelling errors. 
During the course of the study, a study monitor (CRA) will make site visits to review protocol 
compliance, compare eCRFs against individual subject’s medical records, assess drug 
accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory 
requirements. 
Electronic CRF entries will be verified with source documentation. The review of medical 
records will be performed in a manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is maintained.  
Checking the eCRFs for completeness, clarity and cross checking with source documents is 
required to monitor the progress of the study. Direct access to source data is also required for 
inspections and audits, and will be carried out giving due consideration to data protection and 
medical confidentiality. Each investigator will have assured Kadmon of full access to complete 
source data for study participants and associated necessary support at all times. 
In addition to routine monitoring procedures, audits of clinical research activities in accordance 
with SOPs may be performed to evaluate compliance with the principles of GCP.  A regulatory 
authority may also wish to conduct an inspection (during the study or even after its completion).  
If a regulatory authority requests an inspection, the investigator must immediately inform 
Kadmon that this request has been made. 
Study conduct may be assessed during the course of the study by a Clinical Quality Assurance 
representative(s) to ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol.  Thi s 
designee, as well as the CRA, will be permitted to inspect the study documents (study protocol, 
eCRFs, investigational product accountability, original study-relevant medical records).  All 
subject data will be treated confidentially.  In the course of the clinical study, access will be 
available to Kadmon or designee (eg, CRO) to view the eCRFs after completion of the individual

16.2 Informed Consent 
A properly executed, written informed consent document, in compliance with 21 CFR, Part 50 
and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, will be obtained from each 
subj
ect before the subject is entered into the study and before any study screening procedure is 
performed that involves risk.  Attention will be directed to the basic elements required for 
incorporation into the informed consent under US Federal Regulations for Protection of Human 
Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a]) and (21 CFR 50.25[b]), as necessary.  Sample ICFs will be supplied 
to ea
ch site. Kadmon or its designee must review any proposed deviations from the sample ICF. 
The final IRB-approved document must be provided to Kadmon for regulatory purposes. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], to obtain 
written informed consent from each subject (or the subject’s legally authorized representative) 
participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, 
a
nd potential hazards of the study. In the case where the subject is unable to read, an impartial 
witness should be present during the entire informed consent discussion. After the subject has 
orally consented to participation in the study, the witness’ signature [CONTACT_589751]. A copy of the ICF 
must be provided to the subject or to the subject’s legally authorized representative. If applicable, 
it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language.  The site will retain the original

KD019  
 Protocol Number KD019 -[ADDRESS_776896] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] 
19.1 Investigator’s Files and Retention of Documents 
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should 
be classified into two separate categories as follows: (1) investigator’s study file and (2) subject 
c
linical source documents. 
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol and protocol amendments, eCRFs, query 
forms, IRB and governmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug 
re
cords, staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and 
correspondence. 
Subject clinical source documents (usually predefined by [CONTACT_486533]) may include subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, 
physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, X-ray, 
pathology and special assessment reports, signed ICFs, consultant letters, email communication 
and subject screening and enrollment logs. The investigator must keep these two categories of 
documents on file for at least [ADDRESS_776897] from the eCRFs. 
 
These records include detailed notes on: 
 
 Medical history 
 Da te and time of informed consent with HIPAA authorization either contained in the ICF 
or presented to the subject candidate as a standalone document 
 De scription of the complete consenting process 
 The  basic identifying information that linked the subject’s medical record with the eCRFs 
 The  results of all diagnostic tests performed, diagnoses made, therapy provided, and any 
other data on the condition of the subject 
 The  medical condition of the subject during their involvement in the study 
 All adve rse events 
 The  subject’s exposure to the study medication 
 The  subject’s exposure to any concomitant therapy 
 All re levant observations and data on the condition of the subject throughout the study 
 J ustification for all entries in the subject’s eCRF 
 R adiology images (hard copy and digital), and reports if required 
 De ath information and any available autopsy data 
A subject log of all potentially eligible subjects considered, but not consented, for obvious 
deviations from the entry criteria, will be kept at each site. The log will contain subjects’ initials, 
diagnosis, eligibility, or, if not eligible, reason for not consenting.  All consented subjects will be 
logged, regardless of whether they ultimately enroll.  
Upon request, the investigator will supply Kadmon with any required background data from the 
study documentation or clinic records. This is particularly important when eCRFs are illegible or 
when errors in data transcription are suspected. In case of special problems or governmental 
queries or requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study 
records, provided that subject confidentiality is protected.

 19.3 Audits and Inspections 
The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made 
available to appropriately qualified personnel from the Kadmon Quality Assurance Unit (or 
designee), or to health authority inspectors after appropriate notification. The verification of the 
eCRF data must be by [CONTACT_85349]. 
19.4 Electronic Case Report Forms 
Clinical study data for this study will be captured on electronic case report forms (eCRF) 
de
signed for computer processing and analysis.  This computerized system will be validated and 
compliant with 21 CFR Part 11. Corrections to data will be made according to 21 CFR Part 11, 
Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures. If corrections are made after review and sign-off by 
[CONTACT_093], he/she must be aware of the changes and provide written acknowledgement. 
There will also be an electronic audit trail.  The investigator agrees to provide all information 
re
quested on the eCRF in an accurate manner according to instructions provided.  The 
investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data 
reported to Kadmon in the eCRF and in all required reports. 
An eCRF is required to be submitted for every subject who receives any amount of study drug.  
This i
ncludes submission of retrievable data on subjects who withdraw before completion of the 
study.  Prior to submission, eCRFs must be reviewed for completeness and accuracy, and signed 
and dated where indicated by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_445372].  If a subject stops treatment or terminates from the study, the dates and reasons must be 
noted on the eCRF. 
  
KD019  
 Protocol Number KD019 -[ADDRESS_776898] operating procedures (SOPs) for compliance with applicable 
government regulations. 
It is understood that the responsible Kadmon study monitor (or designee) will contact [CONTACT_589746] (eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in 
accordance with local requirements.  The principal investigator (or a designee) and key study 
pe
rsonnel must be available to assist the monitor during these visits.  The investigator (or 
designee) must agree to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected during 
the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
It will be the monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRFs in comparison to source documents at 
re
gular intervals throughout the study according to the monitoring plan, to verify the adherence 
to t
he protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being entered on 
them and clarifying any data queries. The monitor should have access to laboratory test reports 
a
nd other subject records needed to verify the entries on the eCRF.  The completed and corrected 
e
CRFs/CRFs for completed visits will either be collected by [CONTACT_589747]. The investigator is responsible for the timely 
c
ompletion of eCRFs by [CONTACT_210164].  The eCRFs are expected to be completed within 
se
ven (7) days of the subject’s visit.  A copy of the eCRFs will be retained by [CONTACT_589748] a secure place with other study documents, such as the 
protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure, and any protocol amendments. 
Upon completion of the study, the monitor will make a final assessment of the conduct of the 
study and inventory all clinical supplies to be returned to Kadmon. 
 
 
KD019  
 Protocol Number KD019 -[ADDRESS_776899] ensure that subjects’ anonymity will be maintained and that their identities 
are protected from unauthorized parties. On eCRFs or other documents submitted to Kadmon 
and the IRB, subjects should be identified by [CONTACT_589749]/or initials and not by 
[CONTACT_2249]. The investigator should keep a subject enrollment log. The investigator should 
maintain documents not for submission to Kadmon (eg, subjects’ written consent forms) in strict 
c
onfidence. 
Authorized regulatory officials and Kadmon personnel (or their representatives) will be allowed 
full access to inspect and copy the records.  All study drug, subject bodily fluids and tissue, 
and/or other materials collected shall be used solely in accordance with this protocol, unless 
otherwise agreed to in writing by [CONTACT_486519].

The formula is: QTc(F) = QT/(RR1/3) 
 
 Manu ally and carefully measure the QT msec (use the longest) 
 The  "RR interval in seconds" = dividing 60/heart rate 
 P ower of 1/3 = 0.34 
 Ta ke the RR and elevate it to the power of 0.34 
 Divide the  QT by [CONTACT_589750]: 
 
For a QT of 400 msec and a heart rate of 80 bpm

In the responses below, area-specific jargon should be avoided or explicitly explained.   Do not say “see protocol” or “protocol attached”. Protocol templates are available on the IRB forms page. 2.1 What is your research question? State hypothesis or primary objective, and provide a brief background on subject population, treatment procedures, and the rationale for conducting the study. This study aims to test whether there is a difference in the analgesic effect between TAP blocks and surgical infiltration during the first [ADDRESS_376505]-operative pain.  To augment this pain there are many 
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           [ADDRESS_376506] (TAP) block is one such procedure involving the injection of a local anesthetic into the plane of the transversus abdominal muscle where the terminal branches of nerves lie.  A similar, yet different analgesic approach is that of direct injection of local anesthetic into the incision by [CONTACT_307553].  These two approaches have both been proven to decrease post-operative pain in patients for many procedures, but never compared to one another.  Background and Significance Even with the advancement of using laparoscopic and robotic technologies in total hysterectomies, patients still suffer from pain.  This study hopes to use a randomized controlled double-blinded approach to investigate the different analgesic outcomes from surgical infiltration of analgesics to that of ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks in this procedure. Other studies have looked at the enhanced analgesic efficacy of both TAP blocks in laparoscopic and robotic procedures, as well as that of direct infiltration of anesthetics into the incisions following surgery.[ADDRESS_376507] not been undertaken in a single double-blind study in which to compare the analgesic efficacies.   2.2  Who developed the research plan/protocol?  Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_307525]:        2.3 Explain how the study design and methods will answer the research question. This is a double blinded randomized study.  All patients will receive one form of local anesthetic pain relief either from TAP or infiltration.  Patients will be randomized to one of two study arms in a double-blinded, placebo controlled study.  All patients will receive a TAP infiltration and all patients will receive infiltration into the incision.  In one arm the TAP infiltration will contain 10 mL of 0.25 % bupi[INVESTIGATOR_307526] 20 mL of a 50:[ADDRESS_376508] of 10 mL of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_307527]. The surgeon infiltration will consist of 5 ml of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_307528] 5 ml of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_307529].  A TAP infiltration is an injection of local anesthetic under the covering of the transversus abdominis muscle layer which provides effective post operative analgesia.2-[ADDRESS_376509] of 10 mL of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_307530] [ADDRESS_376510] 5 mL of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_307531] & Biological/Medical Application Form           5 incisions. Investigational Drug Service (IDS) pharmacy will be charged with the blinding of medications vs. saline for these procedures.         2.4 What will the subjects be asked to do solely for the purpose of this research?  Subjects will be asked to be randomly assigned to receive either a TAP with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_307532].  They will also be asked to answer questions at various time points related to their pain, answer a survery on their quality of recovery.  They will also be asked to allow the research staff to access their medical chart to obtain information about their pain medication use, complications, demographics, and time of discharge.   2.5 Does the study involve treatment?  No.    Yes. List any procedure that would be performed if research was not conducted (i.e. procedures performed for diagnostic or treatment purposes).  all procedures would be performed if research was not conducted as both the TAP and infiltration are standard of care.  2.[ADDRESS_376511] be submitted with your application: If the research includes Appendices and supplemental materials required   Administration of approved or unapproved drugs, chemical or biological agents Appendix E required with the application  Administration of approved or unapproved devices Appendix F required with the application  Genetic testing (whether or not results are returned to subjects) Appendix G required with the application  Use of (collecting or having access to) Protected Health Information (PHI)  Appendix H required with the application  Field Work Appendix L required with the application  Use of a deceptive technique Appendix N required with the application  A debriefing script is also required.

The federal regulations require that consent be in language understandable to the subject. If subjects do not comprehend English, translated consent forms are required, or the use of short forms with an oral explanation can be accepted.  Consent forms must be submitted for IRB review. It is highly recommended that researchers use the sample consent for template available on the IRB Forms page. Do not submit sponsor prepared forms without editing the form to include University of Minnesota IRB standard language and all essential elements of informed consent.  Resources for preparing consent forms are available at: Informed Consent Online Tutorial – http://www.research.umn.edu/consent/  If the researcher is requesting a waiver of consent, complete questions 9.[ADDRESS_376531] had adequate time to 
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           [ADDRESS_376532] (co-PI).    9.2  Will anyone not listed on this application obtain consent? Except in rare circumstances, all individuals who will obtain consent must be listed as research personnel on the IRB application so that basic human subjects’ research training is documented.  If in-person consent will not be obtained, select the option below and provide rationale.  No If no, go to question 9.3  Yes Explain who, other than those listed as personnel on this application, will obtain consent          N/A In-person consent will not be obtained.  Explain below:       9.[ADDRESS_376533].   all staff will complete CITI training.   Note:  Everyone obtaining consent must complete CITI training.   9.4  Will all subjects consent for themselves?  Yes If yes, adults lacking capacity to consent must be listed in the exclusion criteria (question 4.7).    No If no, indicate below who, when appropriate, will provide consent  Parent/guardian  Legally authorized representative – Appendix I required  9.5  What questions will be asked to assess the subjects’ understanding? Questions should be open-ended and go beyond requiring a yes/no response. What are the benefits and risks of the tap or infiltration? What are the benefits and risks of either local anesthetic medication? How will your pain be managed post-operatively in both options of the study? What are the alternative treatment options to control your pain post-operatively? What will be done if you have an allergic reaction or reaction to the pain medication in this study?   9.[ADDRESS_376534] be included in the consent form (see 21 CFR 50.25).  If a contract to pay for research-related injuries exists, the language in the consent form should not contradict the language in the contract.  9.7   Is there a potential for research related injury?  
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           [ADDRESS_376535].     If the preferred injury compensation language is unacceptable to the study sponsor, the following alternative language may be used:  Under some circumstances the sponsor of the study will pay for care for injuries resulting directly from being in the study.  If you want information about those circumstances or if you think you have suffered a research related injury let the study physicians know right away.   Waiving Documentation of Consent Waiving written documentation assumes that there will be an informed consent process but signatures will not be collected on the consent form. The IRB may waive the requirement for written documentation under specific conditions.    9.8 Does the researcher wish to waive documentation of consent?   No If no, go to question 9.[ADDRESS_376536] and the research would be the consent form and the principal risk of the research would be the potential harm from a breach of confidentiality (the IRB may allow an option to sign or decline)    The research presents no more than minimal risk and includes no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside the research context. NOTE: Researchers requesting a waiver of documentation must submit a consent form without signature [CONTACT_307575].  Waiving Consent The IRB may, in some rare and specific circumstances, waive the requirement for consent in accordance with 45 CFR 46.116(d).  Answer the questions below to determine if waiver of consent may be considered.

Option 4 Reviewed by [CONTACT_307572]. Section 12.6  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN A data and safety monitoring plan (DSMP) is meant to assure that each clinical investigation has a system for oversight and monitoring of the conduct of the clinical investigation.  This oversight is intended to ensure the safety of the participants and the validity and integrity of the data.  A DSMP should be commensurate with the risks.   A DSMP can be as simple as the investigator reporting adverse event information to the IRB. A DSMP can be as complex as having a Data and Safety Monitoring Board. A DSMP can include clinical trial monitoring.  Clinical trial monitoring refers to the methods used to oversee the conduct of, and reporting of data from, clinical investigations including appropriate clinical investigator supervision of study site staff. Monitoring activities include communication with the investigator and the study site staff; review of the study site’s processes, procedures, and records; and verification of the accuracy of the data.   12.6.1 In addition to the Principal Investigator, are there other DATA monitoring entities responsible for this function? Select all that apply.  No, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_307541].

When established, the list of the DSMB members including their affiliation and credentials and the DSMB charter must be submitted to the IRB.  A description of the DSMB must be provided with the application.    A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is an independent group of experts that advises the study investigators. Primary responsibilities of a DSMB are to 1) periodically review and evaluate the accumulated study data for participant safety, study conduct and progress, and, when appropriate, efficacy, and 2) make recommendations concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the trial. The DSMB considers study-specific data as well as relevant background knowledge about the disease, test agent, or patient population under study.  The DSMB reports should be provided to the IRB as they are received.

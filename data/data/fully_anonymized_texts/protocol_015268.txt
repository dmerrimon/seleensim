Study Rationale
PF-05082566 is a fully  humanized I gG2 monocl onal antibody  and promising new molecular 
entity  that binds to human 4 -1BB with high affinity  and specificit y.  MK -3475 is a potent and 
highly  selective humanized monoclonal antibody  (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isoty pe designed 
to directly  block the interactio n between PD -
1(programmed death -1)and its ligands, 
PD-L1and PD- L2.  In vitro and in vivo data demonstrated immunomodulatory  activity  and 
anti-tumor activity  of PF -05082566 when dosed as a single agent, in combination with 
antibody -dependent cellular cy totoxicity  (ADCC ) inducing an t ibodies, and significantly  
enhanced anti -tumor activity  in combination with anti-PD1 antibodies.  The safet y and 
tolerability  of PF -[ADDRESS_1113912]-in-Patient Phase 1study  a

a single agent and in combination with rituximab (Study  B1641001).  PF- 05082566 has been 
well tolerated (thus far up to 
2.4mg/kg) when administered every  4-weeks (q4wks) ,without
adverse events (AEs) above Grade 1severity attributed to PF -05082566, when administered 
as a single agent .  The preliminary  pharmacokinetic ( PK)results from the ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_1113913] that exposure of PF-05082566 increases dose proportional lywith a terminal 
half-life of approximately  10days.
MK-3475, previousl y known as SCH 900475
,is apotent and highly  selective humanized 
monoclonal antibody  (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isoty pe designed to directly  block the 
interaction between PD -1and its ligands, PD -L1and PD -L2.  MK -3475 has been studied in 
patients with advanced solid tumors.  Anti- tumor activity has been noted in advanced 
melanoma, as well as advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC )patients.  I n addition, 
MK-
[ADDRESS_1113914] 
anti-4-1BB antibody .  PD -L1may be expressed on tumor cells as a result of activated T cells 
within the tumor producing inflammatory  cytokines, such as interferon gamma ( IFN
-).  In 
accord with this, studies in mice sugges t that activated tumor -infiltrating Tlymphocy tes 
(TILs) induce the expression of PD -L1, which in turn results in down modulation of the 
Tcells.   This is thought to be one mechanism for tumor cell evasion of the immune sy stem .  
Tumor cells expressing PD -L1may be better candidates for anti
-PD-1therapi[INVESTIGATOR_806896] -L1.  It is clear from the study  of biopsies that man y tumors do not 
contain detectable numbers of infiltrating T cells, which could account in part for lack of 
PD-L1expre ssion in many  of these tumors .  In theory , an agonist anti - 4-1BB antibody  may  
activate T cells, which can traffic to tumors that would not otherwise contain these activated 
cells, where they  may  induce the expression of PD -L1.  Therefore, the local environ ment

Page 13STUDY DESIGN
This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose, safety, pharmacokinetic  
 study designed to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and 
determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of PF-05082566 in combination with MK-3475 in patients with advanced solid tumors . 
Once the MTD of PF-05082566 administered in combination with MK-3475 has been 
estimated with confidence, one or more expansion cohorts of patients with selected advanced solid tumors will be enrolled to further study the safety, tolerability,  
and preliminary anti-tumor activity for PF-05082566 in combination with MK-3475 to 
support recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) selection, as well as to study tumor-associated biomarkers
.  The tumor types for further study could include NSCLC and potentially other 
tumor types based on emerging data from the dose escalation phase of this study.
Antitumor activity will be assessed by [CONTACT_806922], 
at [ADDRESS_1113917] dose of study drug, and every 6 weeks thereafter, whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the time of End of Treatment/Withdrawal (if not done in the previous 6 weeks), using RECIST version 1.1.  Safety will be monitored at regular intervals throughout the study by [CONTACT_806923].  Pharmacokinetic  blood endpoints will also be monitored in all patients. 
For all patients in dose-expansion cohorts, a de novo
biopsy will be required at study entry 
followed by a second biopsy at the time of the week 9 scans (after 3 cycles of treatment).  Optional de novo biopsies may be collected from patients in dose-escalation cohorts to support the assessment of disease progression.   
 
 
 
Study Treatments:
PF-05082566 will be administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion q3wks in escalating 
doses and may include the following planned doses: 0.20 mg/kg, 0.45 mg/kg, 0.9 mg/kg, 1.8 mg/kg, 3.6 mg/kg, and 5 mg/kg.  The starting dose of PF-05082566 will be set at 0.45 mg/kg.
MK-3475 will be administered as a 30 minutes IV infusion at a dose of 2 mg/kg q3wks.  This 
MK-3475 dose was chosen based on PK, safety, and efficacy considerations (see Section 1.3
for more details).
After estimation of the MTD for the combination on the q3wk schedule, PF-[ADDRESS_1113918] defined disease progression who are 
continuing to derive clinical benefit from the study treatment will be eligible to continue treatment with PF-05082566 plus MK-3475 provided that the treating physician has determined that the benefit/risk for doing so is favorable.  The duration of treatment will be up to 32 cycles (approximately 24 months) in all patients.
Dose escalation and MTD estimation for the PF-05082566 plus MK-3475 combination will 
be conducted according to the following algorithm:
a. Dose escalation and de-escalation of PF-05082566 follows the Time-to-Event 
Continual Reassessment Method (TITE-CRM) up to a maximum dose of 5.0 mg/kgq3wk.
b. The MTD is defined as the highest combination dose with a DLT rate <25% from the 
model estimate.
c. Dose escalation stops if: 
Maximum study sample size is reached; or
[ADDRESS_1113919] been treated at the estimated MTD; or
All doses appear to be overly toxic and the MTD cannot be determined in the 
current trial. 
Treatment with study drugs will continue until completion of 32 cycles (approximately 
24 months) of treatment, disease progression (RECIST v. 1.1), patient refusal, unacceptable toxicity occurs, or the study is prematurely terminated by [CONTACT_1034]; whichever comes first.  Discontinuation from treatment may be considered at the investigator’s discretion for patients who have attained a confirmed CR, have been treated for at least [ADDRESS_1113920] dose of study CCI

by 24 hour urine collection (see Table 4).  Urine reflex microscopy is required whenever urine multitest dipstick is positive for blood or protein. 
14. Serum/Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a s erum or urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on 
two occasions prior to starting study therapy - once at the start of screening and once at the baseline visit, immediately before study drug administration.  Pregnan cy tests will 
also be routinely repeated at every cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally wh enever one menstrual cycle is missed or when 
potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by [CONTACT_1744]/IECs or if required by [CONTACT_427].  For Day 1 of 
each cycle, pregnancy testing is required immediately before study drug administration.  See Section 7.1.1 for contraception guidelines.
15. Endocrine function assessment (in addition to T3, FT4, and TSH):   During treatment, to be performed in cases of suspected hypoadrenalism or hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297].  See 
Table 4for Laboratory Tests list.
16. Registration: Patient number and dose level allocation operated by [CONTACT_3954].
17. Trial Treat ment/PF -
05082566 administration:  PF-05082566 will be administered once every 3 weeks (1 cycle = 21 days) as a 1 hour intra venous infusion.
18. Trial Treat ment/MK -3475 administration:   MK-[ADDRESS_1113926] -PF-05082566 and pre -MK -3475 pharmacokinetic blood samples are drawn (See Section 5.3.6 for acceptable periods 
for dose delays due to infusion reactions).

Page 2019. Tumor Assessments:   Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites.  Imaging may include chest, abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI  scans; brain CT or 
MRI scan, and bone scans (see Section 7.4.1 ).  The CT scans should be performed with contrast agents unless contraindicated for medical reasons.  The same imaging 
technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline will be employed in the following tumor assessme nts.  Antitumor activity will be assessed 
through radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline, at 9 weeks then every 6 weeks, whenever disease progression is susp ected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and 
at the time of End of Treatment (if not done in the previous 6 weeks).  Timing should follow calendar days and should not be adju sted for delays in cycle starts.  Follow-up 
bone scans are required every [ADDRESS_1113927] ve rsion 1.1.
20. Adverse Event (AE) Assessments:  Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using NCI CTCAE version 4.03.  Patients must be followed for AEs for 
[ADDRESS_1113928] resolved, whichever is later; or earli er than 28 days should the patient commence another 
anticancer therapy in the meantime.  For serious adverse events (SAEs), the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated  representative begins from the time that the 
patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving 
investigational product, through and including [ADDRESS_1113929] MK-3475.  SAEs expe rienced by a patient after the active 
reporting period (see Section 8.2 ) has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the Investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the Invest igator 
believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug are to be reported to the Sponsor.  AEs (serious  and non-serious) should be recorded on the Case 
Report Form (CRF) from the time the patient has taken at least one dose of study treatment through last patient visit (Day [ADDRESS_1113930] dose).  If a patient begins a new 
anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non-serious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Pregnancy or brea st feeding that occur during the trial, within 
120 days of discontinuing treatment with MK-3475, or within 28 days after the cessation of study treatment if the patient begins a new anticancer therapy, whichever is 
earlier, should be reported as in Section 8.10 (Exposure During Pregnancy).
21. Concomitant Medications: All concomitant medications including supportive care drugs (eg, anti-emetic treatment and prophylaxis), and the drugs used to t reat AEs or 
chronic diseases should be recorded in the CRF.
22. Blood for PF-05082566 Pharmacokinetics: Blood samples will be collected during Cycle 1-4 on (a) Day 1 at pre-dose and end of infusion; (b) During Cycle 5 on Day 1 at 
pre-dose, end of infusion, and at 2, 6, and 24 hrs after the start of infusion; (c) on Days 8 (192 hours), and 15 (360 hours) after  start of infusion (See Section 7.2 for guidelines 
on timing of blood draws); (d) During Cycle 6 on Day 1 at pre-dose; (e) During Cycle 7 on Day 1 at pre-dose, end of infusion, 24 hr s after the start of infusion and on Day 8; 
and (f) Beyond Cycle 7, PK samples will be collected at pre-dose, for every [ADDRESS_1113931] 10 patients in total from all expansion cohorts.  For other patients (all expan sion cohorts), predose 
samples on Day 1 will be collected for Cycles 1, 3, 5, 6 ( Section 7.2.1 ) and 7.  Beyond Cycle 7, PK samples will be collected  at pre-dose, for every 2 cycles up to Cycle 12, 
and every 4 cycles thereafter.  Timing of sampling may be modified based on emerging PK data.  For patients discontinuing from t he study, a PK sample should be collected 
at the End of Treatment assessment.
23. Blood for MK-3475 Pharmacokinetics: Blood samples will be collected (a) During Cycle 1- 4 on Day 1 at pre-dose and end of infusion; (b) During Cycle 5 on Day 1 at 
pre-dose; and end of infusion(c) During Cycle 7 on Day 1 at pre-dose,  end of infusion, 24 hrs, and on Day 8 (192 hrs) after start of i nfusion (See Section 7.2 for guidelines on 
timing of blood draws).  Beyond Cycle 7, PK samples will be collected at pre-dose every two cycles up to cycle 12, and every [ADDRESS_1113932] 10 patients in total from all expansion cohorts.  For other patients (all expansion cohorts), predose samples on Day 1 will  be collected for Cycles 1, 3, 5 and 7.  Beyond 
Cycle 7, PK samples will be collected at pre-dose (Day 1), every 2 cycles up to Cycle 12, and every 4 cycles thereafter.  Timing of sampling may be modified based on 
emerging PK data.  For patients withdrawing from the study, a PK sample should be collected at the End of Treatment assessment.

subsequently pre-dose (Day 1) every 2 cycles up to Cycle 12, and every 4 cycles thereafter.  For patients discontinuing study drug treatment, immunogenicity samples should 
be collected at the End of Treatment assessment day.  If ADAs are detected, additional samples may be collected approximately e very 3 months (coinciding with disease 
assessment visit) until ADA levels return to baseline.
30. Blood for MK-3475 Immunogenicity (ADA) Testing: Blood for MK-3475 immunogenicity testing will be collected at pre -dose in Cycles 1,3, 5, 7 and subsequently predose 
every 2 cycles up to Cycle 12 and every 4 cycles thereafter.  Ad ditionally,  ADA samples will be collected at 28 days, and during Fo llow-Up (3 months and 6 months after the 
end of MK-3475 treatment).
31. End of Treatment: To be performed approximately [ADDRESS_1113933] dose of study drug.  Obtain these assessments if not completed during the p revious week on study 
(during the previous 6 weeks on study for tumor assessments).
32. Follow Up: Patients should be evaluated up to [ADDRESS_1113934] every 4 weeks until resolution or de termination, in the clinical judgment of the 
Investigator, that no further improvement is expected.  PK and immunogenicity samples should be collected as described in the PK  and Immunogenicity Assessment section 
in Schedule of Activities ( Table 3 ).  Patients whose disease has not progressed at the end of treatment will enter into disease follow-up.  During this follow-up  period, 
patients will have disease assessments performed every 12 weeks 7-days.  Once patients have exhibited disease progression or began a new anti-cancer therapy, or 6-month 
follow-up from the date of the first dose of the last enrolled patient, whichever occurs first, they will be withdrawn from the  study.  See Section 4.3.1 Contraception for 
guidelines on contraception checks during this period.

Page 301. INTRODUCTION
This is a Phase 1b study of PF-05082566, a novel fully humanized IgG2 monoclonal 
anti-body (mAb) agonist of 4-1BB (CD137, TNFRSF9), in combination with MK-3475, a PD-1 inhibitor mAb.  The study is designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) 
 of PF-05082566 administered intravenously in combination 
with MK-3475 to adults with advanced solid tumor malignancies.
1.1. Indication
Relapsed or refractory solid tumors. 
1.2. Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Scientific Rationale: 4-1BB Target Biology and Mechanism of Action
4-1BB (CD137, TNFRSF9), first identified as an inducible costimulatory receptor expressed 
on activated T cells, is a membrane spanning glycoprotein of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptor superfamily.  Current understanding of 4-1BB indicates that expression is generally activation dependent and encompasses a broad subset of immune cells including activated NK and natural killer T (NKT) cells; regulatory T cells; dendritic cells (DC) including follicular DC; stimulated mast cells, differentiating myeloid cells, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils (Wang et al. 2009),
21and activated B cells (Zhang et al. 2011).22  
4-1BB expression has also been demonstrated on tumor vasculature (Broll et al. 2001, Seaman et al. 2007)
1,19and atherosclerotic endothelium (Olofsson et al. 2008).16The ligand 
that stimulates 4-1BB (4-1BBL) is expressed on activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs), myeloid progenitor cells and hematopoeitic stem cells. 
4-1BB is undetectable on the surface of  T cells but expression increases upon activation. 
Based on homology to other members of the TNFRSF, ligand binding is expected to induce receptor trimerization resulting in activation (Chan et al. 2007).
2Some members of the 
TNFRSF can cleave the extracellular domain from the cell surface and exist in a soluble form. Soluble 4-1BB and soluble 4-1BBL have been demonstrated in the serum of some patients with autoimmune diseases and cancers (Furtner et al. 2005; Hentschel et al. 2006; Michel et al. 1998).
8,9,13
Upon 4-1BB activation, TRAF 1 and TRAF 2, pro-survival members of the TNFR-associated 
factor (TRAF) family are recruited to the 4-1BB cytoplasmic tail resulting in downstream activation of NFkB and the Mitogen Activated Protein (MAP) Kinase cascade including Erk, 
Jnk, and p38 MAP kinases.  NFkB activation leads to upregulation of Bfl-1 and Bcl-XL, 
pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family.  The pro-apoptotic protein Bim is downregulated in a TRAF1 and Erk dependent manner (Sabbagh et al. 2008).
18
Numerous studies of murine and human T cells indicate that 4-1BB promotes enhanced cellular proliferation, survival, and cytokine production (Croft 2009).
4Reports have shown 
that 4-1BB agonist mAbs increase costimulatory molecule expression and markedly enhance cytolytic T lymphocyte responses, resulting in anti-tumor efficacy in various models.  4-1BBagonist mAbs have demonstrated efficacy in prophylactic and therapeutic settings and both monotherapy and combination therapy tumor models and have established durable anti-tumor CCI

Page 31protective T cell memory responses (Ly nch 2008) .124-1BB agonists also inhibit 
autoimmune reactions in a variet
y of autoimmunity models (Vinay et al. 2006) .20This dual 
activity  of 4-1BB offers the potential to provide anti-tumor activity  while dampening 
autoimmune side effects that can be associated with immunotherapy  approaches that break 
immune tolerance.
Interaction of 4 -1BB on activated normal human B cells with its ligand at the time of B cell 
receptor engagement s timulates proliferation and enhances survival (Zhang et al. 2011) .[ADDRESS_1113945] of 4 -1BB engagement in B cell ly mphoma has been investigated in two 
published studies.  Evaluation of several ty pes of h uman primary  non-H odgkin ’s lymphoma 
(NHL )samples indicated that 4 -1BB was expressed predominantly  on infiltrating T cells 
rather than the ly mphoma cells (Houot et al. 2011) .10The addition of 4 -1BB agonists to
invitro cultures of B lymphoma cells with rituximab and NK cells resulted in increased 
lymphoma killing (Kohrt et al.2010) .11
In addition, B

experiments peripheral blood B cell numbers were either unchanged or decreased.
1.2.2. Pre-clinical Development of PF-05082566
PF-05082566, an intravenous (IV) full y human IgG2monoclonal antibody (mAb), binds to 
the extracellular domain of human 4-1BB with high affinity  and specificity  and is capable of 
4-1BB agonism.  Injection with PF - [ADDRESS_1113946] mA bs demonstrate significant combinatorial efficacy  with antibody -dependent

subcutaneous (SC) dose at 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg to Balb/C mice [ADDRESS_1113955]-response model, the EC
50was 
estimated to be 11 nM (1650 ng/mL) and the derived EC 10was 4.2 nM (630 ng/mL).  
Administration of MAB9371 also resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in the transplantable mouse lymphoma model.  Based on the simulation from the PK  model of tumor growth inhibition, a 0.2 mg/kg dose corresponded to complete response of tumor inhibition during the study period.  The estimated average serum concentration (C
ave) of 
MAB9371 at 0.2 mg/kg was 12 nM (1800 ng/mL), which was consistent with the EC 50of 
11 nM estimated from the sCD137 data. The 0.02 mg/kg dose corresponded to 10% response in tumor growth inhibition (TGI).  A mean drug serum concentration of 11.5 nM (1730 ng/mL) from the biomarker and TGI studies was used for human efficacious dose projection.  The average circulating sCD137 of 5.25 ng/mL was correlated with complete TGI, and was assumed to be the desired drug-induced biomarker level for efficacy.
1.2.7. Preclinical Toxicology of PF-05082566
The nonclinical safety summaries for PF-05082566 and MK-3475 can be found in their 
respective investigators procures (IBs).  No nonclinical toxicology studies have been conducted with the combination of PF-[ADDRESS_1113956] anti-PD-1, a 2-week exploratory toxicology study was conducting in mice using subcutaneous injection of 
the surrogate anti-mouse 4-1BB (MAB9371) and the surrogate anti-mouse PD-1 (RMP-14).  Male C57/Bl/6 mice were dosed once with vehicle, MAB9371, RMP 1-14, or a combination 
of RMP and MAB9371.  Administration of MAB9371 at 0.1 mg/kg or RMP 1-14 at 
20 mg/kg alone resulted in effects in white blood cell lineages.  Platelet effects occurred at 
1 mg/kg of MAB9371.  Administration of MAB9371 at 1 or 5 mg/kg, or the combination of 
RMP 1-14/MAB9371 at 20/0.1, 20/1 or 20/5 mg/kg resulted in mild hepatic and/or splenic histologic changes.  MAB9371 appeared to be the main contributor to the hepatic and splenic effects, as the effects were not significantly increased by [CONTACT_806927] 1-14.  Therefore, it did not appear that the anti-PD-1 mAb contributed significant additive toxicity 
when co-administered with the anti-4-1BB mAb.

The safety of PF-05082566 is being assessed in an ongoing Phase 1, open-label,

long-term survival in many  solid tumors. 
The Programmed Death -1(PD-1) receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway  hijacked b y 
tumors to suppress immune control.   The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell 
surface of activated T -cells under health y conditions, is to down -modula te unwanted or 
excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions.   PD- 1 (encoded by  [CONTACT_426060]1) is an Ig superfamily  member related to CD28 and CTLA -4which has been shown to 
negativel y regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of it s ligands (PD -L1and/or 
PD-L2).29,30  The structure of murine PD - 1has been resolved.31  PD- 1 and family  members 
are typeI transmembrane gly coproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cy toplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of 
signaling molecules.  The cy toplasmic tail of PD - 1contains 2 tyrosine- based signali ng 
motifs, an immunoreceptor ty rosine -based inhibition motif (I TIM) and an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD - 1recruits the ty rosine 
phosphatases SHP -1and SHP -2to the I TSM motif within its cy toplasmic ta il, leading to the 
dephosphory lation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are 
involved in th e CD3 T-cell signaling cascade .32-[ADDRESS_1113960] from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlap pi[INVESTIGATOR_77971] .36,37PD-1was shown to be expressed on 
activated l ymphocy tes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and 
Natural Killer cells [ 38; 39].  Expression has also been shown during th ymic development on 
CD4- CD8- (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells .40
The ligands for PD -1(PD-L1and PD- L2) are constitutively  expressed or can be induced in a 
variet y of cell types, including non -hematopoietic tissue s as well as in various 
tumors.36,41,42,43Both ligands are t ype I transmembrane recepto rs containing both I gV-and 
IgC-like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cy toplasmic regions with no 
known signaling motifs.   Binding of either PD - 1ligand to PD -1inhibits T -cell activation 
triggered through the T -cell receptor.   PD-L1i s expressed at low levels on various 
non-hematopoietic tissues, most notably  on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2protein is 
only detectabl y expressed on antigen
-presenting cells found in ly mphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory  environments.   PD-L2is thought to control immune T -cell activation in 
lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1serves to dampen unwarranted T
-cell function in peripheral 
tissues.36Although healthy  organs express little (if any ) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were 
demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1has been suggested to 
regulate tumor -specific T- cell expansion in patients with melanoma.44  This suggests that the 
PD-1/PD
-L1pathway  play s a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be 
considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
MK-3475 is a potent and highly  selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isot ype designed to di rectly block the interaction between PD -1and its ligands, 
PD-L1and PD- L2.

[IP_ADDRESS].1. MK-3475 Safety Data
The safet y of MK-3475 is being assessed in six ongoing clinical trials, PN001, PN002, 
PN006, PN010, PN011 and PN012.  S afety  data of single -agent MK -3475 are onl y available 
from Study  PN001 at this time.  Protocol 001 (PN001) is an open- label Phase I study, which 
includes a dose -escalation component in patients with solid tumors (Part A) and with 
subsequent expansion cohor ts in patients with melanoma (Parts B and D) and NSCL C 
(Parts C and F).  PN001 PartA evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, 
administered Q2W.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities 
were observed.  Based on PK data showing a half -life of 21 days, the protocol was amended 
to include a dosing frequency  of Q3W in the expansion cohorts (Parts B through F).
Preliminary  data (as of 26 July 2013) are available from 479 patients enrolled in PN001: 
PartA (n=30) 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg MK -3475 dosed q2wks to q3wks , Part B 
(n=308) 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg MK -3475 dosed q2wks to q3wks , Part C (n=38) 10 mg/kg 
MK-3475 dosed q3wks , and Part D (n=103) 2 or 10 mg/kg MK -3475 dosed q3wks .  Of the 
479patients who ha ve received MK-3475 in Protocol 001, 466 (97.3%) experienced 
treatment emergent AEs of which 368 (76.8%) were considered drug -related. Significant 
adverse events ( SAE s)were reported in 30.1% of patients, but SAEs that were attributed as 
potentially  (poss ibly, probably , or definitel y) drug -related b y Investigators were reported in 
6.7% of patients overall.   Potentially  immune -related AEs have been observed, including 
pneumonitis (
Grade 1-2)in both melanoma and NSCL C cohorts.   The most commonly  
reported tr eatment emergent AEs experienced are fatigue, nausea, cough, pruritus, diarrhea 
and rash.   Most patients continued treatment in spi[INVESTIGATOR_748956], and only  4.2% of 
patients discontinued study  treatment due to an AE that was considered related to stud y 
treatment b y Investigators.
Of the 162 patients who received 2 mg/kg MK -3475 dosed 
q3wks (Parts B1, B2 and D) in 
PN001, 160 (98.8%) experienced treatment emergent AEs of which 128 (79.0%) were 
considered to be drug -related.  SAEs were reported in 27.2% o f patients, but SAEs that were 
attributed as potentially  (possibly , probabl y, or definitely ) drug -related b y Investigators were 
reported in 9.3% of this subset of patients.  The most commonly  reported treatment emergent 
AEs experienced in this subset of patients are fatigue, nausea, cough, pruritus, rash and 
diarrhea.
Thus, the overall AE summary  suggests that MK -3475 is generally  tolerable and AEs are 
generall y manageable in patients.  Refer to the MK -3475 IBfor specific details.
[IP_ADDRESS]. MK-3475 Clinical Efficacy
StudyPN001 included a total of 135 patients with advanced melanoma who had initiated 
treatment by 06 September 2012.45Efficacy data that were available as of 01 February
2013 we re included in the analyses ofefficac y.  The overall response rate ( ORR )across all 
dose cohorts, evaluated by [CONTACT_806928] v1.1, was 38% 
(95% CI, 25 to 44), with the highest confirmed response rate observed in the cohort that 
received 10 mg/kg q2w ks(52%; 95% CI, 38 to 66).  The response rate did not differ

B1641003Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 39significantly between patients who had received prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_806899] (confirmed response rate, 38% [95% CI, 23 to 55] and 37% [95% CI, 26 to 49], respectively).  Responses were durable in the majority of patients (median follow-up, 11 months among patients who had a response); 81% of the patients who had a response (42 of 52) were still receiving treatment at the time of analysis in March 2013.  The overall median progression-free survival (PFS) among the 135 patients was longer than 7 months.
Study PN001 Part C enrolled 38 patients with NSCLC who experienced progression of 
cancer after initiation of their second line o f systemic therapy to receive monotherapy 
MK-3475. The preliminary ORR was 24% by [CONTACT_806929]. Clinical responses 
have been observed in patients with adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and largecell carcinoma. The median duration of treatment amongst responders is a minimum of34 weeks.
Complete information for MK-3475 may be found in the Single Reference Safety Document 
(SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator Brochure (MK-3475 IB).
1.3. Starting Dose Selection Strategy
In the ongoing first in human Phase 1 Study B1641001, PF-05082566 has been well tolerated 
up to the current dose of 2.4 mg/kg, with no dose-limiting toxicities, and dose escalation continues. However, in order to minimize the theoretical risk of synergistic toxicity due to the combination, the PF-05082566 starting dose for this study will be set to 0.45 mg/kg. 
The starting MK-3475 dose of 2 mg/kg (dosed q3wk) was well tolerated based on published 
single agent safety and tolerability data from the Phase [ADDRESS_1113961]-in-human study (PN001).  In 
this study, MK-3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg q2wks).  PK data analysis of MK-3475 administered q2wks and q3wks showed slow systemic clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half-life of about 3 weeks (21 days), typi[INVESTIGATOR_422473] (refer to IB).   
  This early PK  
data provides scientific rationale for testing q2wks or q3wks dosing schedules.
An interim analysis from the on-going MK-3475 protocol PN001 reported data from 
expansion cohorts with advanced melanoma that are naïve to or previously treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_806900]-3475: 2 mg/kg every 
3 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks.  One of the key clinical 
findings from this analysis suggests that there are not major differences in the AE profile or overall objective response rate (ORR) of MK-3475 when given on an every 3 week schedule at doses of 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg.
In the ongoing first-in-human Phase 1 Study B1641001, PF-05082566 is administered on a 
q4wk schedule. However, since in the present study MK-3475 will be administered on a q3wk dosing schedule, PF-05082566 will also be administered on a q3wk schedule.

Page 40Study Rationale
PF-05082566 is a fully  humanized I gG2 mAb and promising new molecular entity  that binds 
to human 4- 1BB with high affinity  and spec ificity .   MK - 3475 is a potent and highly  selective 
humanized mAb of the IgG4/kappa isoty pe designed to directl y block the interaction between 
PD-
1(programmed death -1) and its ligands, PD -L1and PD- L2.  In vitro and in vivo data 
demonstrated immunomodulatory  activity  and anti -tumor activity  of PF -05082566 when 
dosed as a single agent, in combination with ADCC inducing antibodies, and significantly  
enhanced anti -tumor activity  in combination with anti -PD1 antibodies.  The safet y and 
tolerability  of PF -
05082566 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1study  as a single agent 
and in combination with Rituximab (Study  B1641001).   PF-05082566 has been well 
tolerated (thus far up to 1.2 mg/kg , q4wk
) with no adverse events above Grade [ADDRESS_1113962] that exposure of PF
-05082566 increases dose proportionally with a terminal half -life 
of approximatel y 10 days. 
While preclinical data demonstrated significant immunomodulator y activity and anti- tumor 
activity  of PF -05082566 when dosed as a single agent, it is hy pothesized that in some tumors 
upregulation of programmed death-1 (PD-1) in tumor -infiltrating ly mphoc ytes, and its ligand 
PD-L1on tumor cells, may  down -modulate the a ctivity  of anti -tumor ly mphocy tes stimulated 
by [CONTACT_806930] -4-1BB antibody .  In multiple tumor models , anagonist anti -4-1BB 
antibody  in combination with an anti -PD-
1antagonist antibody  showed significantly  
improved anti -tumor activity  compared with either single agent.  In addition, safet y data in 
mice indicated that the addition of an anti -PD-1antibody  did not add to the toxicity of an 
anti-4-1BB agonist antibody .  Based upon the above considerations, this Phase 1b study  will 
assess the safety  and t olerability , establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the 
Recommended Phase 2Dose (RP2D) of PF -[ADDRESS_1113963] of the trial, and the study  includes monitoring and measures 
that potentially  mitigate risks to the patients enrolled.

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. Study Overview
This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose, safety, pharmacokinetic  
 study designed to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and 
determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of PF-[ADDRESS_1113965]- PF-05082566 and pre-MK-3475 PK blood samples are drawn. 
A maximum of 45 patients will be treated during the dose escalation phase of this study.CCI
CCI
CCICCI
PF-05082566
B1641003Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 43Treatment with study drugs will continue until completion of 32 cycles (approximately 
24 months) of treatment, confirmed objective disease progression, patient refusal, patient lost to follow up, unacceptable toxicity occurs, or the study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034], whichever occurs first. 
Safety will be monitored at regular intervals throughout the study by [CONTACT_806931]. 
Antitumor activity will be assessed by [CONTACT_806922], 
at 9 weeks, and every 6 weeks thereafter, whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), at the time of End of Treatment (if not done in the previous 6 weeks), and during follow-up visits, using RECIST version 1.1. 
Discontinuation from treatment may be considered at the investigator’s discretion for patients 
who have attained a confirmed complete response (CR), that have been treated for at least [ADDRESS_1113966] dose of study drugs, the patient meets the safety parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, and the trial is open.  Patients will resume therapy at the same dose and schedule at the time of initial discontinuation.  Patients who complete a maximum number of 32 cycles (approximately 24 months) on study treatment and demonstrate clinical benefit with manageable toxicity and are willing to continue receiving the study treatment will be given the opportunity to continue treatment upon agreement between investigator and sponsor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  In addition, patients with RECIST defined disease progression who are 
continuing to derive clinical benefit from the study treatment will be eligible to continue treatment with PF-05082566 plus MK-3475 provided that the treating physician has determined that the benefit/risk for doing so is favorable.  (Refer to Section 5.3.4 and 
Section 7.4.1 for details).  Also in this case, the maximum period on-treatment will be 
32 cycles (approximately 24 months).
After estimation of the MTD for the combination on the q3wk schedule, PF-05082566 may 
be co-administered along with MK-3475 to study safety and tolerability on an alternative dosing schedule for both drugs.  Other study drug doses may also be tested based on emerging safety and tolerability data.  The initiation of additional patient cohorts to explore CCI
PF-05082566
B1641003Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 44additional dosing schedules or study drug doses will be done at the discretion of the Sponsor, 
and can occur in parallel with enrollment of patients in expansion cohorts on the q3wk dosing schedule.
In addition, once the MTD of PF-05082566 administered in combination with MK-3475 has 
been estimated with confidence, one or more expansion cohorts of patients with selected advanced solid tumors will be enrolled to further study the safety, tolerability, PK  and preliminary anti-tumor activity for PF-05082566 in combination with MK-3475 to support RP2D selection, as well as to study tumor-associated biomarkers.  The tumor types for further study could include NSCLC and potentially other tumor types based on emerging data from the dose escalation phase of this study.
PK/Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) sampling will be required for all patients (See Table 3 and 
Section 7.2 for details).  No drug interaction is anticipated between PF-[ADDRESS_1113967] follow up scans at 9 weeks (after 3 cycles of treatment).  Optional de novo biopsies may be collected for patients in dose-escalation cohorts to support the assessment of disease progression.  
 
 
3.1.1. Starting Dose
The PF-05082566 starting dose is 0.45 mg/kg (see Section 1.3 ).  The starting dose of 
MK-3475 will be 2 mg/kg (see Section 1.3 ).  Both study drugs will be administered on a 
q3wk schedule. See Section 1.3 for more details.
3.2. Criteria for Dose Escalation
No dose escalation of MK-3475 is foreseen for the estimation of the combination MTD.  
Dose escalation and de-escalation of PF-05082566 will follow the Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method (TITE-CRM) (Cheung and Chappell, 2000)
3up to 5.0 mg/kg.  The 
first three patients (first cohort) will be treated at the starting dose.  For each subsequent patient, the probability of DLT is estimated for each level based on all the collected data from all treated patients up to that time and the prior expectations of toxicity, and the patient is assigned to the currently estimated target level (with escalation restrictions as indicated CCICCI
PF-05082566
B1641003
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 45below), defined as the dose having an estimated probability  of DLT closest to but not greater 
than the target rate (25%).  The probabilities of toxicity  are estimated based on a Bay esian 
statistical model to learn about the overall dose -toxicity  relationship.  Patients’ DL T data will 
be reported to the study  statistician who will update the dose -toxicit y model before the next 
enrolled patient is treated.
The MTD is defined as the highest combination dose with a DLT rate <25% from the model 
estimate (explained in Section 9.2).
Dose escalation stops if
: 
Maximum sample size(n=45, see Section 9.3)is reached ;or 
9evaluable patients have been treated at the estimated MTD ; or
All doses appear to be overly  toxic and the MTD cannot be determined in the current
trial. 
In the TITE-CRM paradigm, patients who have enrolled in the trial, but have not experienced 
DLT,will be included in the probability  calculation with an initial weight equal to the 
proportion of the 6 -week (2 cycles of PF -05082566 and MK -3475) DLT observation period 
that 
the patients have completed (however ,the weight function may  be modified if 
accumulating safet y data in suggest a different pattern) .  Patients who experience DLT or 
complete the observation period without DL
T will be assigned ful l weight (=1).  Details on 
the TITE -CRM method are provided in Section 9.[ADDRESS_1113968], the following restrictions and practical considerations will be followed.
Dose skippi[INVESTIGATOR_806901] (k −> k+1).  In particular, 
at least three patients should have been treated at dose level k before escalation to 
dose level k+1;
At least three patients should have been on treatment (for a minimum of 3 weeks or 
1cycle) and observed DLT rate <33% at dose level k before a patient is assigned to 
dose level k+1 (Note that the waiting window depends on our knowledge in the 
time-to-event pattern of toxicity and accumulating safety data, and thereby [CONTACT_806932].  However, intentional delay in enrollment in the 
absence of DLT or serious
AEs should be minimized and discouraged );
Dose escalation recommendation by  [CONTACT_271853] -CRM algorithm may  be overruled b y 
the sponsor if the nature of the existing data causes safet y concern .
Dose escalation and de -escalation will be carried out according to Table 1.  Intra-patient dose 
escalation will not be permitted.

PF-05082566
B1641003
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 46Cumulative safety  data will continue to be evaluated at the estimated MTD using the 
Bayesian statistical model.  Should emerging data in the expansion cohort indicate the 
selected dose is more toxic than p reviously estimated (>25%), or in the case of an exposure 
plateau or biomarker saturation ( eg, sCD137) the next lower dose or an intermediate dose 
level will be explored, and may  be declared as the RP2D. 
For the first cohort there will be a minimum [ADDRESS_1113969] 3 previously  treated patients.
3.3.DLT Definition
Severity  of AEs will be graded according to CTCAE v 4.03. For the purpose of dose 
escalation , any of the following adverse events occurring during the DLT observation period 
(first 
2Cycles, ie,6weeks) that are attributable to one or both study  drugs will be classified 
as DLTs:
Hematologic:
Grade 4 neutropenia;
Febrile neutropenia, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1000/ mm3with a 
single temperature of >38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of 
38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) for more than one hour; 
Grade3 neutropenic infection;
Grade3 thrombocy topenia with bleeding;
Grade 4 thrombocy topenia.
Non-hematologic:
Grade 3 toxicities (non- laboratory );  
Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_806902] y
;
Grade 4 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).
Other (non AST/ALT) n on-hematologic Grade 3 laboratory value if:
Medical intervention is required to treat the patient
, or
The abnormalit y leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

Page 47Inability  to complete two infusions of MK- [ADDRESS_1113970] combination dose with a DLT rate <25% from the 
TITE -CRM model estimate (explained in Section 9.2).
3.5.Dose Expansion Test Dose
The Expansion Test Dose will be either the estimated MTD or a low er dose if emerging data 
suggest the estimated MTD is more toxic than originally  believed .
3.6.Dose Expansion Phase
The Dose Expansion Phase will test PF -
[ADDRESS_1113971] Dose.  Only doses declared safe in the Dose Escalation Phase will be 
considered.
3.7.Recommended Phase 2 Dose
The RP2D is the dose of PF -05082566 and MK -3475 in combination chosen for further stud y 
based on Phase 1results.  If the MTD prove s to be clinically  feasible for long term 
administration in a reasonable number of patients, such dose usuall y becomes the RP2D .  
Once the MTD is estimated , additional patients may  be enrolled at this dosing level.  I n the 
expansion cohort, patients’ DLT d ata will be entered into the Bay esian statistical model of 
the TITE -CRM procedure.  If the posterior distribution of the model incorporating the 
additional data from the expansion cohort suggests the estimated MTD is associated with a 
higher than expected DLT rate the next lower dose or an intermediate dose level will be 
expanded , and may  be declared as the RP2D.

4.3.Life Style Guidelines
4.3.1. Contraception
In this study, patients of childbearing potential will receive PF-05082566 and MK -3475, 
agents for which the teratogenic risk is currently  unknown.  Two (2) methods of highly  
effective contracep tion must be used throughout the study  and continued for at least [ADDRESS_1113979] dose.  The investigator or his/her designee , in consultation with the patient, will 
select the most appropriate method s
of contraception for the individual patient from the 
permitted list of contraception methods (see below) , and instruct the patient in their 
consistent and correct use.  Patients need to affirm that they  meet at least 2 of the selected 
methods of contraception.  The investigator or his/her designee wil l discuss with the patient 
the need to use highl y effective contraception consistently  and correctly according to Table 2
Schedule of Activities (SOA) and document such conversation in the patient chart .  In 
addition, the investigator will instruct the patient to call immediately  if the selected birth 
control method is discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected. 
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie,perfect use) and 
include:
1.Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of 
contraception is allowed provided the patient remains on the same treatmen t 
throughout the entire study  and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an 
adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness .

5.Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y or bilateral tubal occlusive 
procedure (provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the 
device’s label) .
4.4.Sponsor Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact [CONTACT_1133]'s appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
trial is documented in the study  contact [CONTACT_806934] (coordinator’s 
manual) .
To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y related medical 
questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact [CONTACT_1137].  The contact [CONTACT_4662], 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient s tudy number, 
contact [CONTACT_36535] a help desk in the event 
that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question 
or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patient’ s 
participation in the study .  The help desk number can also be used by  [CONTACT_293067], however it should only  be used in 
the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigational site and 
the study  team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the 
established communication pathway s between the investigational site and study  team for 
advice on medica l questions or problems that may arise during the study .  The help desk 
number is not intended for use b y the patient directly, and if a patient calls that number, he or 
she will be directed back to the investigational site.
5.STUDY TREATMENTS
5.1.Allocation to 
Treatment
Dose level allocation will be performed b y the Sponsor after patients have given their written 
informed consent and have completed the necessary  baseline assessments.   The site staff will 
fax or email a complete Registration Form to the designate d Sponsor study team member .  
The Sponsor will assign a patient identification number, which will be used on all Case 
Report Form (CRF) pages and other trial -
related documentation or correspondence 
referencing that patient and (email) to the site.
For the purposes of this protocol, study  drug refers to both PF -05082566 and MK -3475.  No 
patient shall receive study drug until the Investigator or designee has received the following 
information in writing from the Sponsor:
Confirmation of the patient’s enrollme nt;

PF-05082566
B1641003
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 53Specification of the dose level for that patient; 
Permission to proceed with dosing the patient. 
The Sponsor or designee will notify  the other sites of the inclusion of a new patient, and will 
inform study  sites about the next possible enrollment dat e.
5.2.Drug Supplies
PF-05082566 and MK -3475 will be supplied for the study  by [CONTACT_128651] , 
Worldwide Research and 
Development .  Drug supplies will be shipped to the study  sites with 
a Drug Shipment & Proof of Receipt form.  This form should be completed, filed, and the 
shipment confirmed as directed on the bottom of the Drug Shipment & Proof of Receipt 
form.
5.2.1. Dosage Form and Packaging
[IP_ADDRESS]. PF-[ADDRESS_1113980] will be supplied in glass vials at a 10 mg/mL  concentration and 
labeled as open supplies.  Each vial is packed in an individual carton. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. MK-3475
MK-3475 will be supplied in single -use vials containing 100 mg/4mL  sterile solution for 
intravenous administration.  Each vial is sealed with a coated stopper and oversealed and 
labeled according to local regulatory  requirements. 
5.2.2. Preparation and Dispensing
The site will complete required dosage Preparation Record located in the study  manual.  The 
use of the Preparation Record is preferred but it does not preclude the use of an existing 
appropriate clinical site documentation sy stem.  The existing clinical site's documentation 
system should capture all pertinent/required information on the preparation and 
administration of the dose.  This may be used in place of the Preparation Record aft er 
approval from the [COMPANY_007] monitor. 
See the Dosage and Administration I nstructions (DAI) form for instructions on how to 
prepare the investigational product for administration.  I nvestigational product should be 
prepared and dispensed by  [CONTACT_806935] ( e
g,physician, nurse, phy sician’s assistant, practitioner, pharmacist, or medical 
assistant) as allowed b y local, state, and institutional guidance.
5.3.Administration
A cy cle is defined as the time from Day [ADDRESS_1113981] 2 hours after 
each infusion of stud y drug.
All patients should be weighed within 72 hours prior to dosing for every cycle to ensure they  
did not experience either a weight loss or gain >10% from the prior weight used to calculate 
the amount of study  drug required for dose preparation.   Decision to recalculate the study  
drug dose based on the weight obtained at each cycle can be in accordance with institutional 
practice, however if the patient experienced either a weight loss or gain >10% compared to 
the weight used to calculate the initial dose, the amount of study  drug required for 
preparation and administration for the current cycle must be recalculated using this most 
recent weight obtained.
The study  drug dose escalation levels are shown in Table 1.  In addition, doses of 
PF
-05082566 and MK -3475 available for dose modification according to guidelines in 
Section 5.3.7, are shown below in Table 7.

Discontinuation from treatment may be considered at the investigator’s discretion for patients 
who have attained a confirmed CR, that have been treated for at least [ADDRESS_1113984] dose of study drugs, the patient meets the safety parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, and the trial is still open.  Patients will resume therapy at the same dose and schedule at the time of initial discontinuation. 
Patients who complete a maximum number of 32 cycles (approximately 24 months) on study 
treatment and demonstrate clinical benefit with manageable toxicity and are willing to continue receiving the study treatment will be given the opportunity to continue treatment upon agreement between investigator and sponsor.

5.3.5. Recommended Dose Modifications
Every effort should be made to administer PF-05082566 and MK-3475 at the planned dose 
and on schedule.
In the event of significant toxicity dosing may be delayed and/or reduced as described below.  
In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence of any 
adverse symptom.
Patients who experience an AE meeting the definition of a DLT may be removed from 
treatment, based on the dose modification guidelines listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and in 
consultation with the Sponsor.
Dose modifications may occur in two ways:
Between cycles: next cycle administration may be delayed due to persisting toxicity 
when a new cycle is due to start;
In the next cycle: dose reduction may be required in a subsequent cycle based on 
toxicity experienced in the previous cycle.
Investigators are encouraged to employ best supportive care according to local institutional 
clinical practices and according to the guidance for selected adverse events provided below.
Dose modifications will be reported in the CRF.
5.3.6. Dose Delays
Re-treatment following treatment interruption for treatment related toxicity or at the start of 
any new cycle may not occur until all of the following parameters have been met:
ANC 1,000/L;
Platelet count 75,000/L;CCI

investigator discretion, Grade 2if not considered a safet y risk for the patient) .
If a treatment delay  results from worsening of hematologic or biochemical parameters, the 
frequency  of relevant blood tests should be increa
sed as clinicall y indicated.
Withhold scheduled dose for liver function test (LFT) related AEs (including asy mptomatic) 
Grade 3until return to baseline or Grade 1severity .  In cases of potential liver injury , see 
Secti on 8.6.2.  I n such cases, consultation with a hepatologist should be considered in the 
decision to initiate treatment with anti
-inflammatory medications.
After all toxicities have recovered within the limits described above , treatment with 
PF-05082566 and MK-3475 can be resumed. Both study  drugs should be delay ed 
simultaneously .  If non-hematogic toxicity  does not resolve to Grade 1 (or Grade2if not 
considered a safety
 risk for the patient) within [ADDRESS_1113985] 
two cy cles (the DLT evaluation period), dose reductions in 
PF-05082566 and/or MK -[ADDRESS_1113986] toxicity  experienc ed in 
the previous cy cle(see Table 8).
No specific dose adjustments are recommended for Grade 1/2treatment -related toxicity .  
However, investigators should alway s manage their patients according to their medical 
judgment based o n the particular clinical circumstances.
Patient sexperiencing recurrent and intolerable Grade 2 non- hematologic toxicity  may  
resume dosing ,with specific dose modifications detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS], once recovery  to 
Grade 1
or baseline is achieved.  For guidance on dosing following immune related 
toxicities, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Patients requiring dose reductions in PF -
050825 66may be decreased one dose level ( see 
Table 7).  Patients treated at 2 mg/kg MK - 3475 may be dose reduced to 1mg/kg due to AEs 
possibly attributed to MK- 3475 alone .  Once a patient has a dose reduction in PF - 05082566
or MK -3475 for a drug- related toxicity , the dose will not be re -escalated .  Patient srequiring 
more than 
one dose reduction will be withdrawn from treatment unless otherwise agreed 
between the investigator and the Sponsor . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Drug Dose Modification Guidelines
Table 7below shows the PF -05082566 and MK -3475 doses available for this study .  
Suggested dose modification guidelines are presented in Table 8below.  Both study  drugs

(irECI) and Immune -Related Adverse Events (irAEs)
Events of clinical interest of a potential immunologic etiology  (irECIs) may  be defined as an 
adverse event of unknown etiology , associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an 
immune phenomenon.  irAEs may  be predicted based on the nature of the MK -3475 and/or 
PF-[ADDRESS_1113990] similar mechanism sof action.  
Specif ic irAEs for MK -3475 and

5.4.Drug Storage 
PF-05082566 and MK -3475 will be shipped and stored at a temperature between 2 Cand 
8C. 
The storage conditions stated in the investigator brochure s of both study  drugs will be 
superseded b y the label 
storage statement . The storage conditions and stability  of the 
reconstituted product are detailed in the Dosing Administration I nstructions. If a deviation to 
the storage condition occurs, contact [CONTACT_806936] . 
The Investigator or an approv ed representative ( eg,pharmacist) will ensure that all 
investigational product is stored in a strictly  controlled, secure area, at appropriate 
temperatures and in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements.
Site sy stems must be capable of measurin g and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products).  This should be 
captured from the time of inve stigational product receipt throughout study .  Even for 
continuous monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure which ensures active daily evaluation 
for excursions should be documented.  The operation of the temperature monitoring device 
and storage unit ( for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularly  inspected to 
ensure it is maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported upon discovery .  
The site should activel y pursue options for returning the product to labeled storage 

PF-[ADDRESS_1113993](s) must be stored as indicated.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor.  
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.  
Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be 
provided to the site.
5.5. Drug Accountability 
The Investigator or designated personnel must maintain adequate records do cumenting the 
receipt, use, loss or other disposition of the investigational product(s).  [COMPANY_007] may  suppl y 
drug accountability  forms that must be used or may  approve use of standard institution 
forms.  In either case, the forms must identify  the investiga tional product, including batch or 
code numbers, and account for its disposition on a patient by  [CONTACT_486020], including specific 
dates and quantities.  The forms must be signed by [CONTACT_806937][INVESTIGATOR_806904] r when directed.
At the end of the trial, [COMPANY_007] will provide instructions as to disposition of any  unused 
investigational product.  If [COMPANY_007] authorizes destruction at the trial site, the I nvestigator must 
ensure that the materials are destro yed in compli ance with applicable environmental 
regulations, institutional policy  and any  special instructions provided by  [CONTACT_4618].  Destruction 
must be adequatel y documented.
5.6.Concomitant Treatments
Concomitant treatment considered necessary  for the patient’s well being may be given at 
discretion of the treating phy sician.  Medications intended solely  for supportive care 
(ie,antiemetics, analgesics, megestrol acetate for anorexia) are allowed .
Concomitant medications and treatments, including prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), 
herbal supplements, IV medications and fluids, antiemetic treatment and prophy laxis, and 
transfusions will be recorded in the CRF from [ADDRESS_1113994] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs 
and ECI s as defined in Section 8.14.1. 
5.6.1. Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
Medications or vaccinations specificall y prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial
, except in the case of hematopoietic growth factors and the use of 
steroids for s ymptomatic treatment .  If there is a clinical indication fo r one of these or other 
medications or vaccinations specificall y prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial 
therap y or vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any  questions 
regarding this with the Sponsor Clinical Directo rand/or Medical Monitor .  The final decision 
on any  supportive therapy  or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the patient
patient 's primary  physician.  However, the decision to continue the patient on trial therap y or

allowed after consultation with Sponsor. 
Live vaccines .
Glucocorticoids for an y purpose other than to modulate sy mptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology , except as agreed upon by [CONTACT_429]. 
Consider withholding or discontinuing concomitant therap y with monoclonal antibodies of 
the same subclass as the study  drugs ( ie,IgG2 and I gG4), in patients where anti -drug 
antibodies are detected while on-study .
The concurrent use of vitamins or herbal su pplements should be considered with caution. 
5.7.
Rescue Medications and Supportive Care 
5.7.1. Supportive Care Guidelines 
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary b y the 
treating investigator including but not limited to the items outlined below: 
Diarrhea: All patients who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrol ytes should be substituted via I V infusion.  Patients may receive prophy laxis 
of treatment -
induced diarrhea.  S ymptomatic care such as loperamide (Imodium) is 
recommended.
Nausea/ Vomiting : Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressivel y, and 
consideration should be given in subsequent cy cles to the admini stration of 
prophy lactic antiemetic therapy  according to standard institutional practice.  Patients
should be strongly  encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake.

oral or IV antibiotics or other anti- infective agents as considered appropriate by  [CONTACT_110526] a given infectious condition, according to standard 
institutional practice. ]
Anti- inflammatory  or narcotic analgesics may  be offered as needed.  A cetaminophen/ 
paracetamol to a MAXIMUM total daily  dose of 2 g is permitted.  Daily  intake over 
2g is prohibited.
5.7.2. Supportive Care Guidelines For Infusion Reactions to Either Study Drug
Acute infusion reactions (which can include cytokine release s yndrome, angioedema, or 
anaph ylaxis) are different from allergic/hy persensitive reactions, although some of the 
manifestations are common to both AEs.  Signs and sy mptoms usually  develop during or 
shortly  after drug infusion and generally  resolve completely  within 24hours of completion of 
infusion.  Signs/sy mptoms may  include: Allergic reaction/hy persensitivity (including drug 
fever); Arthralgia (joint pain); Bronchospasm; Cough; Dizziness; Dy spnea (shortness of 
breath); Fatigue (asthenia, letharg y, malaise); Headache; Hy pertension; Hypotension; 
Myalgia (muscle pain); Nausea; Pruritis/itching; Rash/desquamation; Rigors/chills; Sweating 
(diaphoresis); Tach ycardia; Tumor pain (onset or exacerbation of tumor pain due to 
treatment); Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals); and Vomiting. 
Table 12below shows treatment guidelines for patients who experience an infusion reaction 
associated with administration of either 
study  drug.
In the event that a site does not have established procedures for the tre atment of study  drug 
associated infusion reactions, the following guidelines are provided in Table 12.

5.8.2. Corticosteroids
Chronic, sy stemic corticosteroid use for palliative or supportive purpose is not permitted. 
Use of corticosteroids 
as sy mptomatic treatment may be allowed on individual basis and 
upon discussion with the Spon
sor. Acute emergency  administration, t opi[INVESTIGATOR_14929], 
inhaled spray s, eye drops or local injections of corticosteroids are allowed and guidelines are 
provided in Section 5.3.7.
5.8.3. Concomitant 
Surgery
No formal studies have been conducted to determine whether there is a risk to perform 
concomitant surgery in patients under treatment with either PF -05082566 or MK -3475.  As 
safet y risks in this setting are unknown it is suggested that the study  drugs be withheld for 
21days before performing major surgery .  This will provide a margin of safety  of one drug 
half-life(for MK -3475, which has the longer half -life of the two stud y drugs) before 
resuming therap y with the combination.
5.8.4. Concomitant Radiotherapy
Palliative radiot
herap y to specific sites of disease is permitted if considered medically 
necessary  by [CONTACT_74079].  All attempts should be made to rule out disease 
progression in the event of increased localized pain.  It is suggested that the smallest 
radiation doses and smallest fields possible be used for palliation to minimize the 
inflammatory  effects of radiotherapy.  It is suggested that PF-05082566 and
MK-3475 treatment be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy, in consultation with the 
Sponsor.

adhered to, where possible:
Pharmacokinetic blood specimens -obtain at the scheduled time .
Electrocardiograms ( ECG s)–obtain as close as possible to the scheduled time, but 
prior to blood specimen collection and within 30 minutes of the nominal time .
Blood pressure/pulse rate –may be obtained prior to or after ECG collection but must 
be obtained prior to blood specimen collection and within 60 minutes of the nominal 
time.
Clinical safety  laboratory tests –obtain as close as possible to the scheduled time .
Other procedures –All other procedures should be obtained as close as possible to the 
scheduled time, but may  be obtained before or after blood specimen collection, unless 
sampling is determined by [CONTACT_43038] y personnel to potentially impact the results.
6.1.Screening
For screening procedures see theSchedule Of Activities andASSESSMENTS sections .
Screening is to be performed within 28 days of registration .  For medical history , include
history  of other diseases (active or reso lved) and concomitant illnesses.
6.2.Study Period
For treatment period procedures
, see the Schedule Of Activities and ASSESSMENTS
sections .  The End of Treatment assessments are to be performed approximately  28days after 
the last dose of study  drug.  Obtain these assessments if not completed during the previous 
week on stud y (during the previous 6 weeks on study  for tumor assessments).
Patients whose disease has not progressed a t the end of treatment will enter into disease 
follow -up. During this follow -up period, patients will have disease assessments performed 
every 12weeks  7-days. Once patients have exhibited disease progression or began a new 
anti-cancer therap y
(not inc luding radiotherap y to a non- target tumor ), whichever occurs 
first, the date of progression will be recorded on the appropriate CRF page and they  will be 
withdrawn from the study.  No further data will be collected from these patients .  Patients 
continuing to experience treatment -related toxicit y following discontinuation of study
treatment will continue to be followed at least every [ADDRESS_1113995], or they  may  be 
withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safet y or behavioral reasons, or 
the inability  of the patient to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given study  site. 
Reasons for discontinuation of study  treatment may  include:
Confirmed o
bjective d isease progression according to RECI STversion 1.1 (see the
Study  Design Section 3 for details and exceptions);
Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation ;
Unacceptable to xicity(possibly  associated with both study  drugs) ;
Pregnancy ;
Significant protocol violation ;
Lost to follow -up;
Patient refused further treatment ;
Study  terminated by  [CONTACT_2728] ;
Death .
Reasons for withdrawal from study  follow -up may include:
Completed stud y follow
-up;
Study  terminated by  [CONTACT_2728] ;
Lost to follow -up;
Death .
If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_4677] .  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_806938] s 
must be documented in the patient’s medical record .  In an y circumstance, every  effort 
should be made to document patient outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, request the patient to return for a final vi sit, if applicable, 
and follow -up with the patient regarding any  unresolved 
AEs.

PF-[ADDRESS_1113996] can not be performed the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions 
which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. 
The study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  fashion.
7.1.Safety A ssessment
Safety  assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs and phy sical 
examination, ECG (12 -lead) ,laboratory  assessments , including pregnancy  tests and 
verification of concurrent medications.
7.1.1. Pregnancy Testi ng
MK-[ADDRESS_1113997] 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study  
therap y -once at the start of screening and once at the baseline visit, immediately before 
investigational product administration , and at the En d of Treatment visit .  Following a 
negative pregnancy  result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and a 
further negative pregnancy  result will then be required at the baseline visit before the patient 
may receive the investigational p roduct.  Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at 
every  cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study  therapy  and additionally  
whenever one menstrual cy cle is missed or when potential pregnancy  is otherwise suspected.  
In the case of a positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from study medication but 
may remain in the study . 
Additional pregnancy  tests may  also be undertaken if requested by  [CONTACT_1744]/Ethics Committee 
(EC) or if required b y local regulations.
7.1.2. Adverse Events
Asses sment of AEs will include the t ype, incidence, severit y (graded b y the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI  CTCAE] version 4.03) 
timing, seriousness, and relatedness.

must be recorded as such on the Adverse Event case report forms andreported within 
24hours to the Sponsor either by [CONTACT_26365] .
ECIs for this trial include:
1.An overdose of Sponsor's product, as defined in Section 8.[ADDRESS_1113999] or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit 
of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 
2X
the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value 
that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined b y wa y of 
protocol -specified laboratory  testing or unscheduled laboratory  testing.
Note: These criteria are ba sed upon available regulatory  guidance documents.   The
purpose of the criteria is to specify  a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may  
require an additional evaluation for an underly ing etiology .  The trial site guidance for
assessment and follow up o f these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File
Binder (or equivalent).
3.In the event a 
patient develops any  of the following AEs, a detailed narrative of the 
event should be reported as an ECI to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the event:
a.Grade3diarrhea ;
b.Grade 2colitis;
c.Grade 2pneumonitis ;
d.Grade 3hypo-or hyperthyroidism .
A separate guidance document has been provided entitled “Event of Clinical I nterest and
Immune -Related Adverse Event Guidance Document.” This document can be found in the
administrative binder and provides guidance regarding identification, evaluation and 
management of ECIs and irAEs.  Additional ECI s are identified in this guidance document
and also need to be reported to the SPONSOR within [ADDRESS_1114000] dose through 90 days following cessation
of treatment, or the initiation of a new anticancer therap y, whichever is earlier, whether or
not related to the Sponsor's product, must be reported within [ADDRESS_1114001] information can be found in the
administrative binder.
7.1.3. Laboratory Safety Assessment
Hematology ,blood chemistry , coagulation and urinaly siswill be carri ed out at the time 
points described in the Schedule of activities (see the Schedule Of Activities andTable 4)
and anal yzed at local laboratories.  Thyroid function assessme nts will include T3, FT4, and 
thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH )
.  In the presence of clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_806909], laboratory  testing should include one or 
both of the following: 
adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH) and cortisol le vels before and 30-60 minutes after 
corticotrophin stimulation.   Urinal ysis will include measurement of pH, specific gravity , 
protein/albumin, glucose, blood/hemoglobin, ketones/acetone.   Urine dipstick for urine 
protein: if positive collect 24
-hr and micr oscopic (Reflex Testing).   Urine dipstick for urine 
blood: if positive collect a microscopic (Reflex Testing).
7.1.4. Vital Signs and Physical Exam ination
Patient
swill have a physical exam that will include major bod y systems, weight, blood 
pressure, heart rate , assessment of ECOG status and height; height will be measured at 
baseline only . Physical exams will be performed at the time points described in the Schedule 
Of Activities.
7.1.5. ECG Assessments
Electrocardiogram (ECG) : Triplicate 12 -lead (with a 10 -second rhy thm strip) tracing in the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -recumbent position will be used for all ECGs.  I t is preferable that the 
machine used has a capacity  to calculate the standard intervals automatically.  At each time 
point, three consecutive 12 lead ECGs will be performed approximately  2minutes apart to 
determine mean QTc.  When coinciding with blood sample draws for PK, ECG assessment 
should be performed prior to blood sample collection, such that the blood sample is collec ted 
at the nominal time.  I f the mean QTc interval is prolonged (>500 msec), then the ECGs 
should be 
re-evaluated by a qualified person at the center for confirmation.   Clinically  
significant abnormal findings in baseline ECGs will be recorded as medical h istory .  
Clinically  significant findings seen on the follow -up ECGs should be recorded as adverse 
events.
  ECG assessments beyond Screening will not be required for patients in dose 
expansion cohorts (see the Schedule Of Activities).  Additional ECGs may  be performed as 
clinically  indicated.   While pre -dose ECG assessments will be required for all patients, 
post-dose ECG assessments will be required onl y for patients in dose escalation cohorts.

PF-05082566
B1641003Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 74Prior to concluding that an epi[INVESTIGATOR_806910], 
thorough consideration should be given to potential precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4582] (eg, change in patient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and possible evaluation by [CONTACT_4636].
If patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures, 
or stroke), an ECG (triplicate) should be obtained at the time of the event. 
When matched with PK sampling, the ECG must be carried out before each PK sample 
drawing such that the PK sample is collected at the nominal time (ie, the timing of the PK collections over rides the timing of the ECG collections). 
7.2. Pharmacokinetics Assessments (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Cohorts)
PK samples will be assayed for PF-05082566, and MK-3475 using a validated analytical 
method in compliance with [COMPANY_007] (PF-05082566) or [COMPANY_006] (MK-3475) standard operating procedures.  Details regarding the collection, processing, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_134918].
 
 
All efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the scheduled nominal time 
relative to dosing.  However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 minute sample) will be considered protocol compliant, and the exact time of the sample collection noted on the CRF.  If a scheduled blood sample collection cannot be completed for any reason, the missed sample time may be re-scheduled with agreement of clinical investigators, patient and Sponsor.
In addition to samples collected at the scheduled times, an additional blood sample should be 
collected from patients experiencing unexpected and/or serious AE’s and the date and time documented in the CRF.
As part of understanding the pharmacokinetics of the study drug, samples may be used for 
evaluation of the bioanalytical method.  This additional characterization will be used for internal exploratory purposes and will not be included in the clinical report.  Samples collected for this purpose will be retained in accordance to local regulations and if not used within this timeframe, will be destroyed.
7.2.1. PF-05082566
Blood samples will be collected for PK of PF-05082566 at the following time points:
During Cycle 1-4 on (a) Day 1 at pre-dose and end of infusion;

7.4.1. Markers of Drug Response
Study ing the variation in genetic markers and other biomarkers may  help to explain some of 
the variabilit y in response seen with some drugs among different individuals.  This is referred 
to as pharmacogenomic/biomarker research.  Comparing the deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA), 
ribonucleic (RNA), protein, and metabolite variation patterns of patients who respond we ll 
and those who respond poorly  to treatment may  help to better define the most appropriate 
group of patients in which to target a given treatment.  Collecting biospecimens for 
exploratory  pharmacogenomic/biomarker analy ses and retaining them in the [COMPANY_007] BioBank 
makes it possible to better understand the drug’s mechanism of action and to seek 
explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, efficacy , tolerability , or safet y not 
anticipated prior to the beginning of the study .  Providing these biosp ecimens is a required 
study  activit y for stud y sites and patients, unless prohibited as such b y local regulations or 
ethics committee decision. 
To protect patients’ confidentiality , the banked biospecimens and data generated from them 
will be coded with t he patient’s study  identification (ID) number.  Samples will be kept in a 
facility  accessible only  by [CONTACT_195152] -swipe.  Data will be stored on password -protected computer 
systems. The key  between the code and the patient’s personal identifiers will be held at the 
study  site; the researchers using the biospecimens and data generated from them will not 
have access to the key  nor any  personally  identify ing information.  Biospecimens will only  
be used for the purposes described here and in the informed consent doc ument/patient 
information sheet; an y other uses require additional ethical approval.  Unless a time 
limitation is required by  [CONTACT_240846], biospecimens will be 
stored indefinitely  to allow for future research on the topi[INVESTIGATOR_806911], including 
research conducted during the lengthy  drug development process and also postmarketing 
research.  Patients can withdraw their consent for the use of their biospecimens at an y time 
by [CONTACT_7328] a request to the investigator, in which case any remaining biospecimen will be 
destroy ed; data already  generated from the biospecimens will continue to be stored to protect 
the integrity of existing analy ses.  It is very  unlikely  that results generated from the 
biospecimens will have any  clinical, d iagnostic, or therapeutic implications for the individual 
study  participants.  Patients are notified in the informed consent document/patient 
information sheet that their results will not be given to them, unless required by [CONTACT_147655], in w hich case results will be returned via the investigator.  Results will not be 
provided to family  members or other ph ysicians, nor will they  be recorded in the patient’s 
medical record.  There is no intention to contact [CONTACT_806939] .
A 4-mL blood biospecimen ,Prep D1 (K 2edetic acid (ethy lenediaminetetraacetic 
acid)(EDTA)) whole blood collection optimized for DNA anal ysis), will be collected on Day  
1 of Cy cle 1 (pre -dose) to be retained for potential pharmacogenomic/biomark er anal yses 
related to drug response, unless prohibited by  [CONTACT_167188].  
For example, putative safety  biomarkers, drug -metabolizing enzy me genes, drug- transport 
protein genes, or genes thought to be related to the mechani sm of drug action may  be 
examined.

Page 78Detailed collection, processing, storage, and shipment instructions are provided in the central 
laboratory  manual.
It is possible that the use of these biospecimens may result in commercially viable products.  
Patients w ill be advised in the informed consent document/patient information sheet that they  
will not be compensated in this event.
7.4.2. Additional Research
Unless prohibited by  [CONTACT_167188] ,patients will be asked to 
indicate on the co nsent form whether they  will allow the banked biospecimens to also be 
used for the following research:
Investigations of the disease under stud y in the clinical study, and related conditions;
Biospecimens may  be used as controls.  This includes use in case -control studies of 
diseases for which [COMPANY_007] is researching drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; use in characterizing the 
natural variation amongst people in genes, RNA, proteins, and metabolites; and use in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_4587]/biomarkers.
Patients need not provide additional biospecimens for the uses described in this section; the 
biospecimens specified in the Markers of Drug Response Section will be used.  Patients may  
still participate in the clinical study  if they  elect not to allow their banked biospecimens to be 
used for the additional purposes described in this section.
7.5.Immunogenicity Assessments (ADA)
ADA (anti-drug antibodies) blood samples will be assay ed for anti -PF-05082566, and 
anti-MK-3475 antibodies using a validated anal ytical method in compliance with [COMPANY_007] 
(anti-PF-05082566) or [COMPANY_006] (anti -MK-3475) standard operating procedures.  All the 
samples that are positive for ADA may  also undergo characterization for neutralizing
antibodies.
As part of und
erstanding the pharmacokinetics of the study  drug, samples may  be used for 
evaluation of the bioanalytical method.  Th is additional characterization will be used for 
internal exploratory  purposes and will not be included in the clinical report.  Samples 
collected for this purpose will be retained in accordance to local regulations and if not used 
within this timeframe, will be destroy ed.
Blood samples (2 mL for PF -0508 2566 and 6 ml for MK -3475) for evaluation of 
immunogenicity  of PF -05082566/MK -3475 will b e collected at the following time points:
7.5.1. Immunogenicity to PF -05082566
In Cycle 1, 3,5, 7 Day 1at pre -dose;
Cycles > 7, Day 1at predose for every  two cy cles upto Cycle12,and every  4cycles 
thereafter .

PF-05082566
B1641003Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 79For patients discontinuing study drug treatment, immunogenicity samples should be collected 
at the End of Treatment assessment day.  If ADAs are detected, additional samples may be collected approximately every 3 months (coinciding with disease assessment visits) until ADA levels return to baseline.  Samples will be analyzed by a laboratory to be identified by [CONTACT_4618].  See the Laboratory Manual for additional details. 
7.5.2. Immunogenicity to MK-3475
Cycle 1, 3, 5, and 7 Day 1 at pre-dose; 
Cycles >7, Day 1 at predose for every two cycles up to Cycle 12, and every 4 cycles 
thereafter;
Additionally, ADA samples will be collected at 28 days, and during Follow-up 
(3 months and 6 months after end of MK-3475 treatment).
For patients ending from the study, immunogenicity samples should be collected at the End 
of Treatment assessment.  MK-[ADDRESS_1114004].  A de novo biopsy will be required at study entry followed by a second biopsy at the time of the Cycle 3 tumor assessment.  For patients in dose escalation cohorts, unscheduled optional de novo tumor biopsies may be collected at the discretion of the Sponsor and Investigator to support the assessment of disease progression.  Biomarkers that will be assayed may include but will not be limited to IHC assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, PD-L1 IHC, quantitation of T cell receptor sequences, and gene expression.
Please refer to the Study Manual for details pertaining to specific days of sample collection, 
and sample preparation and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]
 
 
7.8. Pharmacogenomic (RNA) Assessments
Blood samples for pharmacogenomic analysis will be required and will be collected on Day 1 
of Cycles 1 and 2 (pre-dose).  Samples will be used to explore gene expression signatures in PBMCs that would be predictive for or characteristic of responses to treatment.  Candidate genes that might influence patient response, may include but will not be limited to CXCR3, IFNG, EOMES, CD28, ICOS, CD40LG, IL2RA, CD80, CCL5, FOXP3, CDC25A, GZMA, IL23A, SOCS1, IL10; PD-1, PD-L1.

PF-[ADDRESS_1114007](s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections . 
For all AE s, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AEand to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a SAE
requiring im mediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained b y the investigator to determine the causalit y of the 
AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  [CONTACT_806940] a level acceptable to the 
investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the Sponsor, an y non -serious 
AEthat is 
determined by [CONTACT_806941]. To 
assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the c linical 
study .
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAEs , the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient ’s 
participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through and including 90calendar day s after the last 
administration of study  drug .  SAE soccurring to a patient after the active reporting period
has ended should be repo rtedto the Sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a 
minimum, all SAE s that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of 
being related to study drug are to be reported to the Sponsor.
AEs (serious and nonserious) should be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF) from the 
time the subject has taken at least [ADDRESS_1114008] feeding that occur during the trial, within 120 days of discontinuing
treatment with MK -3475, or within 28 days after the cessation of study  treatment if the
patient begins a new anticancer therap y, whichever is earlier, should be reported as in 
Section 8.10 (Exposure During Pregnancy ).

PF-[ADDRESS_1114009] or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to : 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse;
Drug interactions;
Extravasations;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ;
Exposure via breastfeeding ;
Medication error;
Occupational Exposure ;
Worsening of signs and sy mptoms of the malignancy  under study  should be reported 
as AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed by  
[CONTACT_265360] .
8.4.Medication Errors
Medicat ion errors may result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong drug, b y the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength .  Such 
medication errors occurring to a study
 participant are to be captured on the med ication error

B1641003
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 83case report form (CRF) which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) page, and on 
the SAE form when appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should 
be notified immediately .
Medication errors are reportable ir respective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the partic ipating patient.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error should be captured on the medication error version of the 
adverse event (AE) page and, if applicable, an y associated adver se event(s) is captured on an 
adverse event (AE) CRF page. 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as an y dose exceeding the prescribed 
dose for MK -3475 or PF -05082566 by 20% over the prescribed dose for the dosing cohort 
under study .  No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose for either of 
the study  drugs.  In the event of overdose, both study  drugs should be discontinued and the 
patient should be observed closely  for signs of toxicity .  Appropriate supportive treat ment 
should be provided if clinically  indicated. 
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as

during the study  or within the safet y reporting period, then the event leading to death 
must be recorded as an adverse event and as a SAE with Common Terminology  
Criteria (CTC) Grade 5 (see Secti on 8.8).
Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the patient or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.   In addition, an overdose of study  
medication should only  be captured as an SAE whe n it meets one of the criteria listed above.
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_134988] y 
database (see Section 8.14.1 for SAE Reporting Requirements).
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Abnormal values in aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) levels 
concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level 
thatmeet the criteria outlined 
below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should alway s be considered 
important medical events. 

PF-05082566

Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 85The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the patient ’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Patients who 
present with the follo wing laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T values 3times the upper limit of 
normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value  2X ULN with no evidence 
of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value2X ULN or not available.
For patients with preexisting AL T OR, AST OR total bilirubin val ues above the 
upper limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For patients with pre -existing AST or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range :AST or ALT values  2times the baseline values and 3X ULN , or 8X 
ULN (whichever is smaller) .
Concurren t with :
For patients with pre- existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin level increased from baseline b y an amount of at least [ADDRESS_1114011] or 
if the value reaches [ADDRESS_1114012] (whi chever is smaller).
The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history , and physi cal assessment.  The possibility  of hepatic 
neoplasia (primary  or secondary ) should be considered.  In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and AL T, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, 
total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirub in, gamma -glutamy l transferase, prothrombin time 
(PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history , 
including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug 
and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational exposure, sexual history , travel 
history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver 
or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute 
hepat itis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging ( egbiliary  tract) may  be warranted.  All cases 
confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria defined above, with no other 
cause for liver function test (L FT) abnormalities identified at the time , should be considered 
potential Hy ’s Law cases irrespective of availability  of all the results of the investigations 
performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s law cases 
should be reported as SAEs.

Page 87Diag nostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AE s.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acut e appendicitis 
that begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.8.Severity Assessment
GRADE Clinical Description of Severit y
0 No Change from Normal or Referen ce Range (This grade is not included in the 
Version 4.03 CTC document but may  be used in certain circumstances.)
1 MILD Adverse Event
2 MODERATE Adverse Event
3 SEVERE Adverse Event
4 LIFE -THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated
5 DEAT H RELATED TO Adverse Event
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not 
necessarily  a SAE . For example headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with the 
patient ’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs listed above .
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements 
if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the inves tigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided
.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the eve nt will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (see section on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causalit y assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", 
this should be clearl y documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that anSAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source docum ents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.

Page 888.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
For investigational products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy  occurs 
if:
1.A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed ( eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant women ( eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male patient has been exposed ( eg, because of treatment or environmental 
exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception 
and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a stud y patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] drug safet y unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
and Exposure During Pregnancy  (EDP) supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE 
has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental 
exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman ( eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed t o a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP 
supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and 
within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the 
anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion or until pregnancy  termination and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow -up to 
the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
the termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless preprocedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). 
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE ( ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live born, a terminated fetus, a n intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed ab ortion;

PF-05082566
B1641003
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 89Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1114013].
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy  may  be requested by  [CONTACT_1275].  Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis 
(eg, follow -up on preterm inf ants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator will provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source 
docume nts that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to 
provide to his partner .
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or other wise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.
An occupational exposure is reported to safet y within 24 hours of Investigator’s awareness, 
using the SAE Report form, regardless of w hether there is an associated AE/SAE.   Since the 
information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study , the information is not reported 
on a CRF, however a copy  of the completed SAE Report form is maintained in the study  
master file.
8.12. Withdrawal D ue to Adverse Events (See also Section 
on Patient Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AEshould be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and record ed on the appropriate 
adverse event CRF page.
When a patient withdraws because of an SAE , the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AE s spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  patient .  In addition, each study  patient will be questioned about AEs.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE s.  If a 
SAE occurs, 
expedite d reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If a SAE occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_1114014] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available adverse event 

PF-05082566
B1641003
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 90information.  This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on 
previously  forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of 
exposure during pregnancy , exposure via breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases .
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a SAE
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  patient initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_1114015] awareness of the AE.
For all 
SAEs , the investigator is obligated to pur sue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information c ollected for SAE s ismore detailed than that captured 
on the AE case report form.  I n general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient 
detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination 
of possible c ausalit y.  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a patient death, a 
summary
 of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfi zer or its 
designated representative. 
8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF.  Where the sam e data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of S AEinform ation.
8.14.3. Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AEreporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodo logy for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by  [CONTACT_4618]. 
This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any  major 
modi fications of the primary  endpoint and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendment.
9.1. A nalysis Sets
1.Safety  anal ysis set.
The safet y analysis set includes all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of 
study  medication.

PF-[ADDRESS_1114016] 2 cycles of PF-05082566 , or complete the two 
cycles’ DLT observ ation period . Note that every  patient will contribute to the 
determination of the MTD including patients who are lost to follow -upprior to 
completion of the two cycles’ DLT observation period.
4.Response anal ysis set.
All enrolled patients who are eligible , receive study  treatment, have baseline tumor 
assessments and at least [ADDRESS_1114017] 1 on study  biomarker assessment will 
be considered evaluable. 
7.ECG/QTc Anal ysis set
8.Treated patients who have baseline and at least 1 on study  ECG/QTc measurement 
will be considered evaluable.
9.2.Statistical Methods for Dose Al location: TITE -CRM
A number of alternative designs have been proposed to the standard 3+3 design for P hase I 
dose escalation trials that improve its accuracy , efficiency  and statistical validity , including 
the continual reassessment method (CRM ),17and its variants. 
Delay ed-onset toxicities are a particular challenge for phase I trials of combination 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .14Most of the available dose -escalation designs, includi ng the 3+[ADDRESS_1114018] completed a fixed

B1641003
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 92observation period for toxicity  (eg, 1-2 cycles of the experiment regimen, or 6 -8 weeks after 
start of treatment) before additional cohorts of pat ients can be enrolled. Thus, trial accrual is 
patient to opening and closing which may  pose logistical risk on the success and completion 
of the study . In addition, patients who are either lost to follow- up or die of event s unrelated 
to treatment are usu ally required to be replaced. Due to these reasons, the trial duration could 
be unacceptabl y long in case of prolonged observation window and unexpected high rate of 
patient drop -out.
The time -to-event continual reassessment method (TITE -CRM), a variant o f the original 
CRM method, is open to accrual continuall y, and maintains other advantages of the CRM 
relative to the 3+[ADDRESS_1114019] acceptable 
DLT rate determined by  [CONTACT_806942].
TITE -CRM is to be implemented as described b y Cheung et al .3and Normolle et al .15for the 
dose-escalation of PF -05082566.  PF-05082566 may be administered intravenously  atthe 
following available dose levels of 0.20, 0.45, 0.9, 1.8, 3.6, and 5 mg/kg on an every  3week 
schedule ( q3wk ).  PF-05082566 will be co -administered with MK -3475 on Day  1of each 
treatment Cy cle.  MK -3475 will be administered at 2 mg/kg , MK - 3475 will be administered 
q3wk.  Higher dose levels may  be available based on the emerging safet y data from single 
agent PF -05082566 dosed at 5mg/kg in the Phase [ADDRESS_1114020] dose that is associated with a DLT rate 25%.   A power function modeling

this prior distribution is combined mathematically  with the observed data to y ield the 
posterior distribution of the parameter (the posterior mean of will be calculated to model 
the dose -toxicity  relationship). The prior distribution determines how responsive TITE -CRM 
is to the accumulated data. With a small0upfront, the posterior toxicity  probability

function with the 3+3 design and other weight functions can be found in Huang et al. 
(2014)47.
Section 3.2 describes the dose escalation/de - escalation criteria, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_806917].
9.3.Sample Size Determination
Due to the d ynamic nature of the Bayesian allocation procedure, the sample size of the 
TITE -CRM approach cannot be determined in advance. The maximum sample size is set 
as45 for dose escalation cohorts in order to have a reliable and accurate estimate of the MTD 
based on simulation results. Based on probability  theor y, a sample size of 45 will ensure the 
estimates of an y binar y variable ( eg,objective response r ate) have a 95% confidence interval 
of width <0.30. A sample size of 45 also enables the detection of any unexpected toxicit y 
that occurs at 5% rate (in a non- dose-dependent fashion) with a probability  of 0. 90, and that 
occurs at 10% rate with a probabili
ty of 0.99. 
A stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] ( see Section 3.2) will also be implemented for possible early  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_806918].
Additional patients will be required for expansion cohorts
.  The total number of patients in 
expansion cohorts will be determined based on emerging data from this study , cancer 
indication, and the patient population of interest
. 
9.4.Efficacy Analysis
Assessment of a nti-tumor activity  is a secondary objective.   Onl y descriptive efficacy 
summaries will be performed for this part of the study .
Tumor 
response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not 
limited to, tumor ty pe, received (maximum) dose, overall tumor re sponse at each visit, and 
best overall response. In addition, disease progression date, death date, date of first response,
and last tumor assessment date will be listed, together with Duration of Response, and PFS 
for the expansion cohort.   Kaplan -Meier plot will be created for TTR, DR and PFS in the 
expansion cohort.  A bar plot for TTR and DR will also be created for confirmed responders 
defined b y RECI ST 1.1. 
9.5.Analysis of Other Endpoints
9.5.1. Analysis of Pharmacokinetics
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics Analysis of PF -[ADDRESS_1114022] plasma pharmacokinetic parameters including the maximum plasma concentration
(Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (T max), and area under the plasma

B1641003Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 95non-compartmental analysis, as data permits. If data permit or if considered appropriate, 
minimum plasma concentration (C min), average plasma concentration (Cave), area under the 
plasma concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC inf), terminal elimination half-life 
(t1/2), total systemic clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vd), accumulation ratio (Rac)
will be estimated. Descriptive statistics will be provided for these PK parameters in tabular form (n, mean, SD, CV, median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) by [CONTACT_2715], cycle and day.
Dose normalized AUC
inf(AUCτat steady state), AUC last, and C maxfor PF-[ADDRESS_1114023] dose (using a logarithmic scale).  These plots will include individual patient values and the geometric means for each dose.  These plots will be used to help understand the dose proportionality for PF-05082566.
For MK-3475, plasma pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined by [CONTACT_806943] a 
validated population pharmacokinetic model.
For PF-05082566 and MK-3475 concentrations, individual values and descriptive statistics 
(n, mean, SD, CV, median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) will be presented by [CONTACT_2715], cycle, day of assessment, and nominal time in tabular form.  Individual patient and median profiles of the concentration-time data will be plotted by [CONTACT_2715], cycle and day using nominal times.  Median profiles will be presented on both linear-linear and log-linear scales.
No drug interaction is anticipated  between PF-05082566 and  MK-3475. Since 
PF-05082566 and MK-3475 are eliminated via a non-specific catabolic degradation process, it is unlikely that concomitant medication can alter their clearance even if target expression is affected. To assess any potential interactions, steady state pharmacokinetics and the formation of anti-drug antibodies will be monitored for both the agents and compared with historical data.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis or PK  Modeling
Pharmacokinetic  data from this study may be analyzed using 
modeling approaches and may also be pooled with data from other studies to investigate any causal relationship between PF-05082566/ MK-3475 exposure and biomarkers or significant safety endpoints. The results of these analyses, if performed, may be reported separately.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of Immunogenicity Data
ADA data will be listed and summarized for each dosing interval for PF-[ADDRESS_1114024] of ADA on PF-5082566 and MK-3475 concentration will be evaluated.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Analysis of Biomarker Endpoints
For tumor biopsy samples, the mean and standard deviation, median, and 
minimum/maximum levels of biomarker measures, including but not limited to percentage of CD3-positive T cells, will be determined at baseline and post-treatment.  For each pair of CCICCI

calculated.  The minimum percent change from baseline needed to declare proof of pharmacology will be based on assay precision and size of the expansion cohort.
 
  The statistical 
approach will examine correlations of biomarker results with pharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumor efficacy.
 
9.6. Safety Analysis
Summaries and analyses of the primary safety endpoint will be based on the per protocol 
analysis set. Summaries and analyses of all other safety parameters will include all patients in the Safety Analysis Set.
9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation component of 
the study. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dose level cohorts is used to estimate the MTD as described in Study Design Section 3 . AEs constituting DLTs will be listed by [CONTACT_5264].
9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events
AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_806944] (CTCAE) version 4.03 and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and percentage of patients who experienced any AE, SAE, treatment related AE, and treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The summaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by [CONTACT_5265] (Cycle 1 and Cycles >2). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Test Abnormalities
The number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be 
summarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assay. The analyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by [CONTACT_5265] (Cycle 1, Cycle 2, and Cycles beyond 2). 
For laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal, 
abnormal or not done.CCICCI
PF-[ADDRESS_1114025] day  of dosing will 
be considered the baseline ECG.   ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate 
measurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations.  Any  data 
obtained from ECGs repeated for safety  reasons after the nominal time -points will not be 
averaged along with the preceding triplicates.  Interval measu rements from repeated ECGs 
will be included in the outlier anal ysis as individual values obtained at unscheduled time 
points.
QT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors [ ie, 
Fridericia’s (default correction), Baze tt’s, and possibly  a study  specific factor, as 
appropriate].  Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, response rate (RR) ,PR, QRS, 
QTcF (and other correction factors, eg,  QTcB as appropriate) by [CONTACT_2715]
.  Individual QT (all 
evaluated corrections) inte rvals will be listed by  [CONTACT_134996].  The most appropriate 
correction factor will be selected and used for the following analy ses of central tendency  and 
outliers and used for the study  conclusions.  Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum, and maximum) will be used to summarize the absolute corrected QT 
value and changes from baseline in corrected QT after treatment ,by [CONTACT_134997].  For 
each patient and b y treatment, the maximum change from baseline will be calculate d as well 
as the maximum post- baseline value across time -points.  Categorical anal ysis will be 
conducted for the maximum change from baseline in corrected QT and the maximum 
post-baseline QT value. 
The effect of drug concentrations on corrected QT change from baseline will be explored 
graphicall y.  Additional concentration- corrected QT anal yses may  be performed.   Data may  
be pooled with other study  results and/or explored further with PK/PD models.
Shift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on st udy QTc (one or more correction 
method will be used) using Maximum CTCAE Grade.  As well as tables of ECG abnormalit y 
at baseline (y es, no, not done: (n, %)).  Patients experiencing clinically -
relevant 
morphological ECG changes will be summarized (includin g frequency  and percentage).
9.7.Data Safety Monitoring Committee
An external Data Safet y Monitoring Committee will not be established for this study . For the 
purpose of this protocol, [COMPANY_007] procedures for periodic safet y review will be applied b y an 
interna l safet y review team consisting of phy sician, safet y specialist, and statistician to 
review individual and summary  data collected in the safet y and clinical databases.
Procedures include:
Surveillance for SAEs according to regulatory  guidelines;
Discussions between the Investigators and the Sponsor of AEs, laboratory  test 
abnormalities, vital signs, and ECG findings observed at each dose level in an 
ongoing manner at regular teleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safet y 

PF-05082566
B1641003
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 98profile and make abenefit/risk assessment and decide if further enrollment is 
appropriate ;
Findings having immediate implication for the management of patients on study  will 
be communicated to all Principal Investigators in the timeframe associated with 
unexpected and drug -relate d SAEs.
During the dose -escalation phase, a Dose -Escalation Steering Committee (DESC) will be 
established to perform periodic review of the accumulating safety  data, specificall y, the 
DLTs.  The guidance for dosing and enrollment decisions is based on the Bayesian statistical 
model of TITE -CRM.  Other considerations may  include lower grade AEs, nature and timing 
of the AEs, existing PK/PD data that may  cause safet y concerns.   Following each review, the 
DESC will inform the study
 team and participating inves tigators on dosing and enrollment 
decisions.  A DESC Charter will be prepared and will be available before the first DESC 
meeting. 
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During study  conduct, [COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to e nsure 
that the protocol and good clinical practices ( GCPs )are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.
The study  site may  be subject to review b y the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Ethics 
Committee (EC), and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_4618], or companies 
working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_8901].
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report F orm (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection 
method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient .  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any  form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 

PF-05082566
B1641003
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 99documents) and ensuring that they  are accurate, authentic/ original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when req uired.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_47616]. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry ”.
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's patient chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts . 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the C RF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating patients (sufficient 
information to link records, eg,CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety  reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to ICH, local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical 
Study  Agreement, whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study r ecords for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third p arty arranged by [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1114026] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of any records, even if 
retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg,
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/I EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/I EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patient s.  In 

PF-[ADDRESS_1114027] notify  the IRB/IEC a nd [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines fo r Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Patients (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on 
Harmonization 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Associ ation 1996 & 
2008). 
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the I nternational 
Conference on Harmonisation guideline on Good Clinical Practice, and applicable local 
regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Patient Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names 
on any  sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any  other disclosures, except where 
required b y laws . 
When study  data is compi[INVESTIGATOR_806919], patient 
names, addresses, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y a numerical code consisting 
of a numbering s ystem provided by  [CONTACT_47617] -identify  study  patients .  The study  
site will maintain a confid ential list of patients who participated in the study  linking their 
numerical code to the patient’s actual identity .  In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will maintain 
high standards of confidentiality  and protection of patient personal data consistent with 
applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and legal requirements including applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consent document(s) used during the informed consent process mus t be 
reviewed b y the sponsor, approved b y the IRB/IEC before use, and available for inspection. 
The investigator must ensure that each study  patient , or his or her legall y acceptable 
representative, is fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible 
risks associated with participation. 
Whenever consent is obtained from a patient’s legally  acceptable representative, the patient’s 
assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the patient has the 
capacity  to provi de assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  If the investigator determines that 
a patient’s decisional capacity
 is so limited he/she cannot reasonabl y be consulted, as 
permitted by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC and consistent with local regulatory  and legal requirements, then 
the patient’s assent may  be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not 
obtained.  If the stud y patient does not provide his/her own consent, the source documents 
must record wh y the patient did not provide consent ( eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), 

PF-05082566
B1641003
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 08 July 2014
Page 101how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient’s legall y 
acceptable representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study  patient ( eg, parent, 
spouse) and that the patient’s assent was obtaine d, or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y it 
must be documented in the source documents.
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject before any  study -specific activity  is performe d.  The investigator 
will retain the original of each subject's signed consent document.
12.4. Patient Recruitment
Advertisements approved by  [CONTACT_36553].
12.5. Reporting of S
afety Issues and S erious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed ( ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
Competent Authority  in any  area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information which might influence t
he evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study patien tsagainst any  immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State
End of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that a sufficient number of patients have been recruited and completed the study  as 
stated in the regulatory  application ( ie,Clinical Study  Application (CTA)) and ethics 
application in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (r ecruiting less than the anticipated 
number in the CTA) b y a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is 
considered a normal conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries
End of Trial in al l other participating countries is defined as Last Patient Last Visit . 
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC, drug safet y problems, or at the discretion of [COMPANY_007].  I n 
addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of PF -[ADDRESS_1114028] all participating patients and 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601]  (if applicable) within [ADDRESS_1114029] extent possible.

CATEGORIZING LESIONS AT BASELINE
Measurable Lesions 
Lesions that can be accurately  measured in at least one dimension.
Lesions with longest d iameter twice the slice thickness and at least [ADDRESS_1114040] or MRI  (slice thickness 5-8 mm).
Lesions with longest diameter at least [ADDRESS_1114041] X -ray. 
Superficial lesions with longest diameter 10 mm or greater when assessed by  [CONTACT_4733].
Malignant ly mph nodes with the short axis [ADDRESS_1114042].
NOTE: The shortest axis is used as the diameter for malignant lymph nodes, longest 
axis for all other measurable lesions . 
Non-measurable disease
Non-measurable disease includes lesions too small to be considered measurable (including 
nodes with short axis between 10 and 14.9 mm) and truly  non-measurable disease such as
pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, leptomeningeal disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, clinical lesions that cannot be accurately  measured 
with calipers, abdominal masses identified b y physical exam that are not measurable b y 
reproducible imaging techniques.
Bone disease: Bone disease is no
n-measurable with the exception of soft tissue 
components that can be evaluated b y CT or MRI and meet the definition of 
measurability  at baseline. 
Previous local treatment: A previously  irradiated lesion (or lesion subjected to other 
local treatment) is n on-measurable unless it has progressed since completion of 
treatment.
Normal sites
Cystic lesions: Simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions and should 
not be recorded either as target or non -target disease.  Cy stic lesions thought to 
represent cy stic metastases can be measurable lesions, if they  meet the specific 
definition above.  If non -cystic lesions are also present, these are preferred as target 
lesions.
Normal nodes: Nodes with short axis <[ADDRESS_1114043] be documented 
appropriatel y.If baseline assessment is inadequate, subsequent statuses generall y should be 
indeterminate. 
Target lesions
All measurable le sions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability  for 
accur ate repeated measurements.  Record the longest diameter for each lesion, except in the 
case of pathological l ymph nodes for which the short axis should be recorded.  The sum of 
the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions 
at baseline will be the basis for comparison to assessments performed on study . 
If two target lesions coalesce the measurement of the coalesced mass is used.  If a 
large target lesion splits, the sum of the parts is used.
Measurements for target lesions that become small should continue to be recorded.  If 
a target lesion becomes too small to measure, [ADDRESS_1114044] disappeared; otherwise a default value of 5 mm should be 
recorded.
NOTE: When nodal lesions decrease to <10 mm (normal), the actual measurement 
should still be recorded.
Non-target disease 
All non-measurable disease is non- target .  All measurable lesions not identified as target 
lesions are also included as non -target disease.  Me asurements are not required but rather 
assessments will be expressed as ABSENT, INDETERMI NATE, PRESENT/NOT 
INCREASED, INCREASED.  Multiple non
-target lesions in one organ may  be recorded as a 
single item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelv ic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple 
liver metastases’).
OBJECTIVE RESPONSE S TATUS AT EACH EVALUA TION.
Disease sites must be assessed using the same technique as baseline, including consistent 
administration of contrast and timing of scanning.  I f a change needs t o be made the case 
must be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution is possible.  If not, 
subsequent objective statuses are indeterminate.

Page 110Target disease
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all target lesions with the 
exception of nodal disease.  All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis 
<10mm).  All target lesions must be assessed.
Partial Response (PR): Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the 
sum of diameters of all target measurable l esions.  The short diameter is used in the 
sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is used in the sum for all other target 
lesions.  All target lesions must be assessed. 
Stable: Does not qualify  for CR, PR or Progression.  All target lesions must be 
assessed.  Stable can follow PR only  in the rare case that the sum increases by  [CONTACT_4736] 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously  documented 30% decrease no 
longer holds. 
Objective Progression (PD): 20% increase in the sum of diameters of tar get 
measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in 
the sum is observed during therap y), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. 
Indeterminate. Progression has not been documented ;and 
One or more target measurable lesions have not been assessed; 
or
Assessment methods used were inconsistent with those used at baseline;
or
One or more target lesions c annot be measured accuratel y (eg , poorly  visible 
unless due to being too small to measure);
or
One or more target lesi ons were excised or irradiated and have not reappeared or 
increased. 
Non-target disease
CR: Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
levels. All ly mph nodes must be ‘normal’ in size (<10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD: Per sistence of an y non -target lesions and/or tumor marker level 
above the normal limits.

Page 111PD: Unequivocal progression of pre- existing lesions. Generally  the overall tumor 
burden must increase sufficiently  to merit discontinuation of therapy .  In the presence
of SD or PR in target disease, progression due to unequivocal increase in non- target 
disease should be rare. 
Indeterminate: Progression has not been determined and one or more non -target sites 
were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent wit h those used at 
baseline.
New Lesions 
The appearance of an y new unequivocal malignant lesion indicates PD.  If a new lesion is 
equivocal, for example due to its small size, continued assessment will clarify  the etiology .  
If repeat assessments confirm the lesion, then progression should be recorded on the date of 
the initial assessment.  A lesion identified in an area not previously scanned will be 
considered a new lesion.
Supplemental Investigations
If CR determination depends on a residual lesion that de creased in size but did not 
disappear completel y, it is recommended the residual lesion be investigated with 
biopsy  or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  If no disease is identified, objective status is CR.
If progression determination depends on a lesion with an incr ease possibly due to 
necrosis, the lesion may  be investigated with biopsy  or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_134941]. 
Objective progression
Patients requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression should not be repo rted as PD on tumor assessment CRFs.  This should be 
indicated on the end of treatment CRF as off treatment due to Global Deterioration of Health 
Status.  Every  effort should be made to document objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

1.2 Estrogen receptor (ER) positivity has been observed in 38-60% of all ovarian 
cancers  (1,2). Ninety percent of all borderline ovarian tumors express ER (3). 
Aromatase is expressed by 33 -81% of ovarian cancers (6). Estrogen receptor 
positivi ty is seen in 80 % of all endometrial cancers, more commonly in the low 
grade endometrioid tumors (23). Expression of aromatase has been observed in 67% of all endometrial cancers (15,16).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_938453] been reported in the literature (13, 14, 26). In a GOG trial of anastrozole reported by [CONTACT_692010], a 9% response rate was observed (2 PR and 2 stable disease)  in 23 patients with recurrent/ metastatic endometrial cancer  not 
exposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy (13). The [ADDRESS_938454] one prior progestational agent and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. A 9.4% response rate and 39% stable disease was observed. A median progression -free survival of 6.7 months was observed in the subset with stable disease (13). Among 19 patients with available tissue in the second trial, ER positivity and PR positivity was seen in 86% of the cases. Only 2 of these 19 patients had a response, both having a partial response and both been ER and PR positive tumors. Seventy percent of the patients treated in the trial of Ma et al had not received prior hormonal treatment. The response rates seen in this trial were similar to the response rate seen with single agent tamoxifen or single agent progestational agents in recurrent endometrial cancers 
(13). The third trial was reported by [CONTACT_692011], 
persistent or recurrent  endometrial cancer  (26). In this trial, 51 patient s with 
advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer with measurable disease were treated with exemestane 25 mg daily. Estrogen receptor positivity was defined as 2+ staining in 10% or more of the cancer cells. There were no resp onses noted in 11 
evaluable patients with ER negative disease. Among 40 patients with ER positive disease, responses were seen in 4 patients (10% response rate) with 2 patients achieveing a complete response. . An additional 25% of patients (10/40 patients) 
had stable disease after 6 mont hs of treatment, for a 35% benefit ratio a fter 6 
months of treatment.  All patients who responded to treatment had long lasting 
remissions (over 55 months and 23 months for the 2 patients who achieved a CR and 25.6 and 26.6 months among the patients who achieved PR ).  
 
 [ADDRESS_938455] been 
completed on relapsed ovarian cancer. These studies showed a variable lev el of 
activity with a response rat e ranging from 0 -35% and stable disease noted in 20-
42%. (4-6).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_938456] phase 2 trial of letrozole in relapsed ovarian cancer. A total of 60 patients were treated. The authors observed a significant correlation between E R and PR expression in the tumors and benefit 
from treatment (prolongation of time to progression, CA-125 responses) (7). CA-125 responses (greater than 50% decreases in baseline levels) were noted in 8% of the patients. Median time to progression was 12 weeks for the whole group. Stable disease at 12 weeks was noted in 17% of the patients with a median time to progression of 35 weeks for this subset (7). The authors concluded that there seems to be a subset of ovarian cancers that may benefit from letrozole therapy and that this subset is characterized by [CONTACT_692012].  
 1.[ADDRESS_938457]. Colon -Otero’s practice is also consistent with the presence 
of a subset of relapsed ovarian cancer patients who may obtain long term benefits from aromatase inhibitor therapy. Six patients with relapsed ovarian cancer cared for by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Colon-Otero had responses to aromatase inhibitors lasting for 1 year to over 13 years after progressing on multiple chemotherapy regimens. Two of the patients had a grade 1 papi[INVESTIGATOR_69121], 2 patients had high grade endometrioid carcinomas and 2 had high grade papi[INVESTIGATOR_691979]. ER and PR data was available in 2/[ADDRESS_938458] a higher level of expression of estrogen receptors (8- 9). 
 
1.8 A trial of everolimus and letrozole in endometrial cancer demonstrated  significant 
activity of this combinatio n (27).  All p atients had received up to 2 prior 
chemotherapy regimens. A 3 2% response rate (11/35 evaluable patients) was 
observed including a 25% CR rate (9 patients). Forty percent of the evaluable 
patients experienced clinical  benefit at 16 weeks (CR, PR or stable disease; CBR) . 
Sixty five percent of the ER positive endometrioid tumors had clinical benefit (13/20 patients). All [ADDRESS_938459].  The 
addition of a cyclin kinase inhibitor (palbociclib, PD0332991) to letrozole in a randomized phase [ADDRESS_938460] cancer  was associated with a significant prolongation of disease 
free survival (11). A total of 165 patients were studied with an increase in PFS 
 6 MC1561 
from 7.5 months to 26 months noted in the group treated with the combination of 
palbociclib (PD0332991) and letrozole (11).  
 1.10 Ribociclib ( LEE011 ) is an oral inhibitor of CDK 4/[ADDRESS_938461] in human trials showed a tolerable dose of 600 mg PO daily or 900 mg PO daily for 3 of 4  
weeks  as well as a dose of 400 mg daily  (12, 19). Multiple phase [ADDRESS_938462] been completed and/or are ongoing. For example, Study CLEE011A2115C is an ongoing, Phase 1B dose-escalation study, followed by a Phase [ADDRESS_938463] been reported including 1 case of hepatic 
function abnormalities and 1 case of elevated serum creatinine. We will use the 
400 mg PO daily dose for this proposed trial. 
 
1.11 The p16- CDK4/[ADDRESS_938464] regulates cell cycle progression from G1-S. Given 
the mechanism of action of ribociclib (  LEE011 ), RB expression is a pre- requisite 
for ribociclib  anti-neoplastic effects. Lack of expression of p16 and expression of 
RB correlate with response to cyclin kinase inhibitors in general although no 
correlation between biomarker expression and response was noted by [CONTACT_692013] (PD0332991)(18). In a xenotropic model of glioblastoma multiforme, Ling et al 
describes that response to cyclin kinase inhibitor (PD0332991) correlated with the presence of wild type RB, the lack of amplification of CDK4 and the lack of p16-INK4a expression (17).  
 1.12 In ovarian cancer, Dong et al found that 71% of the tumors expressed pRb (20). In 
endometrial cancer, loss of Rb expression is a rare event, present in only 4 out of 70 cases studied by [CONTACT_692014] (21,22, 24). Deletion of p16 with associated expression of Rb is not present in  endometrial hyperplasia but has been seen in 
26% of cases of endometrial cancers evaluated by [CONTACT_692015] (25).  
 1.[ADDRESS_938465] in  ER positive ovarian cancers and endometrial cancers may lead to 
synergism when administered concomitantly with aromatase inhibitors. The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_691980] ( LEE011 ).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_938466] completed acrual.  Primary endpoint of this trial was the 
 7 MC1561 
demonstration that mTOR inhibition with everolimus given together with 
letrozole will significantly prolong the time to progression and lead to an increase in the percentage of patients without progressive disease at  12 weeks of treatment 
(PFS12) (a PFS12 greater than 45%) compared to historical controls of letrozole alone (which had shown a PFS12 of 20%). Preliminary analysis of the first 16 patients enrolled in the trial showed that the primary endpoint was met with  69% 
percent of  the patients not progressing at [ADDRESS_938467] cancer, like mTOR inhibition and cyclin kinase inhibition, may also be effective in other ER pos itive tumors 
like ovarian cancer.  
 
2.0 Goals 
2.1 Primary objective:  
Demonstrate if the combination of letrozole and ribociclib (LEE011) leads to a higher percentage of patients who are progression  free at 12 weeks (PFS 12) as 
compared with that observed in prior studies with single agent letrozole .  
2.2 Secondary objectives  
2.21 Demonstrate if the combination of letrozole and ribociclib (LEE011) leads 
to a higher CA -[ADDRESS_938468] of median progression- free 
survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), the confirmed response rate, and adverse events.  
2.3 Correlative Research  
2.31  Identify molecular biomarkers associated with a response to treatme nt 
with letrozole and ribociclib  (LEE011) ( in patients with relapsed ovarian 
carcinomas and endometrial cancers) . 
2.32 Develop PDX avatars on tumors from participants for possible future translational study evaluating a potential correlation between responses in the PDX model to patients’ responses.  
2.321 For proposed future patient derived xenograft experiments, 
response to therapy is tumor volumes measured by [CONTACT_2207]; this 
measurement exhibit a standard  deviation in the range of 10 to 
25% of the tumor volume. Taking the high end of the standard deviation, for each model we anticipate 5 animals per group (control or letrozole + ribociclib) will give us approximately 80% power to determine a 50% difference in tumor volume (57% difference for 4 animals).  Thus, 10 animals/model will be adequate 
for this comparison. To explore whether the responsiveness of 
 8 MC1561 
tumors to letrozole + ribociclib is not due to either agent alone, 
additional cohorts of 5 animals treate d with letrozole and 5 animals 
treated with riboccilcib, will also be treated for a total of 20 animals/model.  However, formal comparisons will only be made 
between control and combination therapy, and thus no penalties for multiple comparisons will be ass essed.  The study endpoint is 28 
days following treatment initiation. “Response” will be defined as tumors with at least a 50% reduction in tumor volume at study end. “Unresponsive” will be defined as tumors with less than 10% tumor volume reduction at stud y end. Intermediate values will be 
defined as “Stable”. Tumor growth curves will be plotted graphically and notated to indicate the outcome status of the originating patients.  End of study tumor volumes will be correlated 
with outcome status of the originating patient in an exploratory fashion. 
The preclinical combinatorial data will be compared to patient 
clinical trial outcome data to determine if the avatar models match clinical findings related to tumor responsiveness to therapy. If so, numerous directions may be taken that could include profiling tumor tissues to identify biomarkers for responsiveness or utilizing the avatar models to explore other therapeutic alternatives to nonresponders. 
2.322 Should these exploratory studies demonstrate a correlation of 
benefit on protocol therapy to a specific “ribociclib/letrozole DNA response signature”, after discussions with the Sponsor and co-investigators, the study will be amended to enroll an additional cohort of patients that are screened and demonstrated to be ‘positive’ for the putative response signature [CONTACT_692035].

Confounding factors and/or alternative causes for increased transaminases should be excluded before dose 
interruption/reduction. They include but are not limited to: concomitant medications, herbal preparations or 
dietary supplements, infection, hepato-biliary disorder or obstruction, new or progressive liver metastasis, and 
alcohol intake.  
8.4 A dditional follow- up for hepa tic toxiciti es 
Increase in transaminases combined with total bilirubin (TBIL) increase may be 
indicative of drug -induced liver injury (DILI), and should be considered as clinically 
important events.  
 24 MC1561 
The threshold for potential DILI may depend on the patient’s baseline AST/ALT and 
TBIL value; patients meeting any of the following criteria will require further follow -up 
as outlined below:  
• For patients with normal ALT or AST or TBIL value at baseline: AST or ALT >3.[ADDRESS_938508] combined with TBIL >2.[ADDRESS_938509] 
• For patients with elevated AST or ALT or TBIL value at baseline: [AST or ALT >2 x 
baseline AND >3.[ADDRESS_938510]] OR [AST or ALT >8.[ADDRESS_938511]], whichever is lower, 
combined with [TBIL >2 x baseline AND >2.[ADDRESS_938512]] 
Medical review needs to ensure that liver test elevations are not caused by [CONTACT_15014], 
defined as: ALP elevation > 2.[ADDRESS_938513] with R value <2 in patients without bone 
metastasis, or elevation of ALP liver fraction in patients with bone metastasis.  
Note: (The R value is calculated by [CONTACT_692021], using multiples of the 
ULN for both values. It denotes the relative pattern of ALT and/or ALP elevation is due 
to cholestatic or hepatocellular liver injury or mixed type injury)  
In the absence of cholestasis, these patients should be immediately discontinued from 
study drug treatment, and repeat LFT testing as soon as possible, preferably within 48 
hours from the awareness of the abnormal results. The evaluation should include 
laboratory tests, detailed history, physical assessment and  the possibility of liver 
metastasis or new liver lesions, obstructions/compressions, etc.  
Hepatic toxicity monitoring includes the following LFTs: albumin, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, (fractionated if total bilirubin >[ADDRESS_938514]), alkaline 
phosphatase (fractionated if alkaline phosphatase is grade 2 or higher), creatine kinase, 
protrombine time (PT/INR) and GGT. For patients with Gilbert Syndrome: total and direct bilirubin must be monitored, intensified monitoring applies to changes in direct 
bilirubin only. 
Close observation is recommended in case of AST, ALT, and/or bilirubin increase 
requiring dose interruption, which involves:  
• Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly. Frequency 
of re-testin g can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or return to 
normal values.  
• Obtaining a more detailed history of current symptoms. 
• Obtaining a more detailed history of prior and/or concurrent diseases, including history 
of any pre-existing liver conditions or risk factors. 
• Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription medications, 
herbal and dietary supplements), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets.  
• Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A , B, C, D, and E; hepatotropic virus infections 
(CMV, EBV or HSV); autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; NASH; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease.  
• Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
Obtaining additional te sts to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin).  
• Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. 
 25 MC1561 
• Assessing cardiovascular dysfunction or impaired liver oxygenation, including 
hypotension or right heart failure as possible etiologies for liver dysfunction.  
• Liver biopsy as clinically indicated to assess pathological change and degree of potential liver injury.  
All cases confirmed on repeat testing meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no other alterna tive cause for LFT abnormalities identified, should be considered as 
“medically significant”, thus met the definition of SAE (Section [IP_ADDRESS]), and reported 
as SAE using the term “potential drug-induced liver injury”. All events should be 
followed up wit h the outcome clearly documented.  
8.5 Dose modification guidance for ri bociclib in case of QTcF  prolongation 
Grade  Dose Modification  
For all 
grades  1. Check quality of the ECG and the QT cF value and 
repeat if needed  
2. Perform an an alysis of serum electrolytes (K+, Ca++, 
Phos, Mg++). I f below the lower limit of normal, 
interrupt ribociclib administration, corre ct with 
supplem ents or appropriate therapy as soon as 
possible, and repeat electrolytes until documented as 
normal . 
3. Review concom itant medi cation usage fo r the potential 
to inhibitCYP3A4 and/or to prolong the QTcF- interval.  
4. Check compliance with correct dose and administration 
of ribociclib

Repeat ECG as clinically indicated until the QTcF returns to < 
481 ms. Restart ribociclib with dose reduced by 1 dose level.  
 
• If QTcF ≥481 ms recurs, ri bociclib should be reduced 
again by 1  dose level (please refer to the dosing 
schedule table)  
• Repeat ECGs 7 days and 14 days after dose 
resumption (then as clinically indicated) for any 
patient who has therapy interrupted due to QTcF 
≥481 ms

• Obtain local cardiologist or qualified specialist consultation  
and repeat cardiac monitoring as indicated until the QtcF 
returns to <481 ms  
Additional follow-up for QTcF prolongation 
In case of QTcF prolon gation r egardless of the gr ade: 
• Perform an analysis of serum pot assium, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, and i f 
below lo wer limit of normal, co rrect with supple ments to within normal limits. 
• Revi ew concomitant medi cation us age for the potential to inhibit C YP3A4 and/or to 
prolong the QT-interval. 
• Check  compliance with co rrect dose and ad ministration of ribociclib . 
8.6 R ibociclib  and letrozole  dose adjustment and management recommendation 
for all other adverse reactions  
Grade  Dose Adjustment and Management Recommendations  
1 No dose adjustment required. Initiate appropriate medical therapy and monitor. 
2 Dose inte rruption until recove ry to Gr ade ≤1. Initiate appr opriate medica l therapy 
and monitor. 
 27 MC1561 
Re-initiate ribociclib  and letrozole at the same dose. 
 If the same toxicity recu rs at Gr ade 2, inte rrupt ribociclib  and letrozole un til 
recove ry to Gr ade ≤1. Re-initiate ribociclib  at the next lower dose level. 
3 Dose inte rruption until recove ry to Gr ade ≤1. Initiate appr opriate medica l therapy 
and monitor. 
Re-initiate ribociclib  and letrozole at th e next lower dose level 
 If toxicity recu rs at Gr ade 2: tem porary dose inte rruption until recove ry to Gr ade 
≤1 and reduce ribociclib  and letrozole dos e to the next lower dose level 
 If toxicity recu rs at Gr ade 3, disc ontinue ribociclib  and letrozole  
4 Discontinue ribociclib  and letrozole  and treat with appropriate m edical therapy. 
Consider performing an analysis of serum potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium for all 
adverse reactions that are potentially associated/aggravated with electrolyte imbalance (e.g. diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, non- QT related cardiovascular events). I f electrolyte values are below the lower limit of 
normal, interrupt ribociclib administration, correct electrolytes with supplements as soon as possible, and repeat electrolyte testing until documented normalization of the electrolytes.  
8.7 Adjustment of S tarting Dose in Special Populations 
Renal impairment  
Insufficient data are available to provide a dosage recommendation for ribociclib in patients with renal impairment.  
Patients with baseline renal impairment are excluded from the study (serum creatinine 
>ULN or creatinine clearance <50 mL/min). Patients who experience renal impairment of Grade [ADDRESS_938517] be told to notify the investigational site about any new medications she takes after the start of the study treatment.  All medications (other 
than study drugs) and significant non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including vitamins, herbal medications,  physical therapy and blood transfusions) administered within [ADDRESS_938518] be listed on the Concomitant medications/Significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_691987]. 
Bisphosphonates and denosumab 
Bisphosphona tes and denosumab are allowed as indicated.  
Hematopoietic growth factors  
Hematopoietic growth factors may be used according to ASCO guidelines. 
 28 MC1561 
Palliative radiotherapy 
Palliative radiation is permitted if done solely for bone pain relief. It should not be 
delivered to a target lesion and it should not encompass more than 25% of 
irradiated bone marrow.  No dose modification of study treatment is needed during 
palliative radiotherapy.  
Permitted concomitant therapy requiring caution  
Refer to the ribociclib (LEE011) Investigator’s Brochure, Section 7.6 and Table 5-7, as well as Appendix III of protocol for information on possible interactions with other drugs. 
Medications to be used with caution during ribociclib and letrozole  in this study 
are listed below (see Appendix III). This list is not comprehensive and is only 
meant to be used as a guide. These medications should be excluded from patient use if possible. If they must be given, then use with caution and consider a ribociclib interruption if the concomitant medication is only needed for a short time (see Appendix III ): 
• Moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 
• Sensitive substrates of CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_938519] narrow therapeutic index 
• Strong inhibitors of BSEP 
• Sensitive substrates of the renal transporters, MA TE1 and OC T2 
• Sensitive substrates of BCRP 
• Medications that carry a possible or conditional risk for QT prolongation 
Prohibited concomitant therapy  
The following medications are prohibited during study treatment in the study (see Section 
7.6 and Table 5-7 of ribociclib IB and Appendix III). This list is not comprehensive and 
is only meant to be used as a guide: 
• Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 
• Substrates of CYP3A4/5 with a narrow therapeutic index  
• Medications that carry a known risk for QT prolongation 
• Herbal medications/ preparations, dietary supplements (except for vitamins) including 
but not limited to: St. John’s wort, Kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, 
dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, black cohosh and ginseng. 
Patients should stop using all herbal medications and dietary supplements at least [ADDRESS_938520] dose of study treatment. 
• Other investigational and antineoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_691988], avoid co -administration of QT prolonging drugs or any other drugs 
with the potential to increase the risk of drug-related QT prolongation (e.g., via a 
potential DDI that increases the exposure of ribociclib or the expos ure of the QT 
prolonging drug). A definitive list of drugs with a known risk, possible risk, or 
conditional risk of QT prolongation and/or Torsades de Pointes (TdP) is available online 
at www.qtdrug.org. 
Medications with a known risk for QT prolongation are prohibited during study 
treatment.

antidiarrheals, analgesics, and/or antiemetics received from the first day of study 
treatment administration until 30 days after the final dose will be recorded in the medical 
records.  
9.4 Diarrh ea: This could be managed conservatively with loperamide (for grade 1 -2 
diarrhea). The recommended dose of loperamide is [ADDRESS_938522] onset, followed by 2 mg every 2 -4 hours until diarrhea free (maximum 16 mg/day). 
In the event of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed: hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals.  
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydration) and/or associated with fever or 
severe neutropenia (grade 3 or 4), broad- spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed. Patients 
with severe diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting should be 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31903]. 
9.5 Concomitant medications : Patients must be instructed not to take any medications (over-
the-counter or other products) during the protocol treatment period without prior 
consultation with the investigator. The investigator should instruct the patient to notify 
the study site about any new medications he/she takes after th e start of study 
drug. All 
medications (other than study drug) and significant non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including 
physical therapy and blood transfusions) taken within 28 days of starting study treatment through the 30-day safety follow up visit should be reported on the CRF.  
9.51 Concomitant Medications 
In general, the use of any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the care 
of the patient is permitted in this study, except as specifically prohibited below. 
Combination administration of study drugs could result in drug -drug interactions 
(DDI) that could potentially lead to reduced activity or enhanced toxicity of the 
concomitant medication and/or ribociclib.

10.0 Adverse Event (AE ) Reporting and Monitori ng 
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics  
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.[ADDRESS_938524] access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site : 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm )  
10.[ADDRESS_938525], identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. 
Next, determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2) 
and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see 
Section 10.3).  With this information, determine whether the event must be 
reported as an expedited report (see Section 10.). Expedited reports are to be 
completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in Sections 
10.4. All AEs reporte d via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.6 and 18.0). 
10.[ADDRESS_938526] Level Term (LLT).  Grade is an essential element of the Guidelines and, in 
general, relates to severity  for the purposes of regulatory reporting to NCI.  
NOTE:  A severe AE, as defined by [CONTACT_941] a bove grading scale, is NOT  the same 
as serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
10.2  Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
• The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on agent- specific 
information provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol and the study specific consent form.  
• Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent -specific information provided in 
Section 15.0 of the protocol and the study specific consent form. 
NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience that is neither 
identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information provided for IRB review nor mentioned in the consent form.  
10.3 Assessment of Attribution  
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s).  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s).  
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s).  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical treatment suggest there is evidence t o indicate a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event.  
 33 MC1561 
10.31   AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial 
Agent(s) on the SAME  Arm  
NOTE:  When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same 
treatment arm as the invest igational agent/intervention (also, 
investigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or other 
investigational therapy under an IND), the entire combination (arm) is 
then considered an investigational intervention for reporting. 
Routine Reporting  
• Routine AE reporting for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies using an investigational agent /intervention in combination with a commercial agent is stated in the protocol.  See Section 10.6.  
• Routine AE reporting for Phase [ADDRESS_938527] igational 
agent/intervention and a commercial agent in combination must be reported as defined by [CONTACT_212263], 
Groups, Cancer Centers, or Principal Investigators. See Section 10.6.  
 
Expedited Reporting  
• An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with 
the guidelines for investigational agents/interventions in Section 10.4, and where indicated, an expedited report must be submitted. 
• An AE that occurs prior to administration of t he investigational 
agent/intervention must be assessed as specified in the protocol. In general, 
only Grade [ADDRESS_938528] possible 
attribution to the commercial agent require an expedited report. Refer to 
Section 10.4 for specific AE reporting requirements or exceptions.  
• Commercial agent expedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via MedWatch.  
• An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated with a commercial agent.  Therefore, if an expected AE (for the 
commercial agent) occurs with a higher degree of severity, expedited reporting is required. The clinical investigator must determine severity.  
 
10.4 Expedited Reporting Requirements for IND/IDE Agents  
Phase 1 and Early Phase 2 Studies:  Expedited Reporting Requirements for 
Adverse Events that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within [ADDRESS_938529] Administration of the Investigational Agent/Intervention 1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312) 
NOTE:  Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether 
or not they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64) 
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15163] ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 36 MC1561 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, 
probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires 
expedited reporting within 24 -hours.  
Reportable categories of Death   
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
• Death Neonatal:  A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_692022] 28 days of life. 
• Death NOS:  A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE 
term associated with Grade 5.  
• Sudden death NOS:  A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of 
the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 
“Neoplasms benigh, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and 
polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ  class 
(SOC) of the same name.  Evidence that the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth 
or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) 
should be submitted. 
10.52  Secondary Malignancy 
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of 
the initial neoplasm.  
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an IND/IDE be reported. Three options are available to describe the event:  
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute  
Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML])  
o Myelodysplastic syn drome (MDS)  
o Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
10.53  Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting .

 [ADDRESS_938530] v1.1 
criteria  
NOTE:  This study uses protocol RECIST v1.1 template dated 2/16/2011. See the 
footnote for the table regarding measureable disease in Section 11.44, as it pertains to data collection and analysis.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1) . Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions and the short axis measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST guideline . 
11.1 Schedule of Evaluations:  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated every [ADDRESS_938531] 
diameter can  be accurately measured as ≥2.[ADDRESS_938532] x-
ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_938533] component of a PET/CT, or MRI.  
11.[ADDRESS_938534] 
diameter is ≥1.0 cm in diameter as  assessed using calipers (e.g. 
skin nodules) or imaging. In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
11.213 A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short 
axis is >1.[ADDRESS_938535] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommen ded to be no greater than 5 mm).  
NOTE:  Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated area are cons idered 
measurable disease.  
11.22 Non-Measurable Disease  
11.221 All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non-measu rable disease, including pathological nodes (those with a 
short axis ≥1.0 to <1.5 cm). Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable as well.  
Note:  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are present 
in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  In 
 [ADDRESS_938536] a short axis <1.0 cm are considered non- 
pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be recorded or followed. 
11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
11.31 Measurement Methods:   
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal 
fractions of centimeters) using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used  
to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and 
during follow-up. For patients having only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_938537]- treatment tumor assessments.   
• Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_692023] a treatment.   
 
11.32 Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease:   
• Conventional CT and MRI: This guidel ine has defined measurability 
of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_938538] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
• As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  The lesions should be measured on the same 
pulse sequence. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
• PET- CT: If the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV 
and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.   
• Physical Examination: For superficial non-nodal lesions, physical examination is acceptable, but imaging is preferable, if both can be done. In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
11.33 Measurement at Follow -up Evaluation:  
• In the case of stable disease (SD), follow -up measurements must have 
met the SD criteria at least once after study  entry at a minimum 
interval of 12 weeks (see Section 11.44). 
 40 MC1561 
• The cyto logical confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion 
that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor 
has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
• Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate 
between PR and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types 
such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain.)  
 
11.[ADDRESS_938539]  
11.41 Target Lesions & Target Lymph Nodes  
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21) up to a maximum of 
5 lesions, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as 
“Target Lesions” and recorded and  measured at baseline.  These lesions 
can be non-nodal or nodal (as defined in 11.21), where no more than 2 
lesions are from the same organ and no more than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected.  
Note:  If fewer than 5 target lesions and target lymph nodes are identified 
(as there often will be), there is no reason to perform additional studies beyond those specified in the protocol to discover new lesions.  
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis 
of their size, be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
(or malignant lymph node) does not lend itself to reproduc ible 
measurements in which circumstance the next largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.   
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD): A sum of the longest diameter 
for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target 
lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD). The BSD will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor response in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
• Post- Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD): A sum of the longest 
diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the post- baseline 
sum of dimensions (PBSD). If the radiologist is able to pr ovide an 
actual measure for the target lesion (or target lymph node), that should 
be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm. If the target lesion (or target 
lymph node) is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small 
to measure, a default value o f 0.[ADDRESS_938540] that the target lesion or target lymph node 
has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 cm. 
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD) is the minimum of the 
BSD and the P BSD.  
11.42 Non-Target Lesions & Non- Target Lymph Nodes  
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non - 
target lesions or non-target lymph nodes and should also be recorded at 
baseline.  These lesions and lymph nodes should be followed in accord with 
11.433. 
 11.[ADDRESS_938541]/MRI/PET- CT/Chest X -ray/physical examination must be 
measured on re- evaluation at evaluation times specified in Section 
11.1. Specifically, a change in  objective status to either a PR or CR 
cannot be done without re- measuring target lesions and target 
lymph nodes.  
Note: Non -target lesions and non-target lymph nodes should be 
evaluated at each assessment, especially in the case of first 
response or confirmation of response. In selected circumstances, 
certain non -target organs may be evaluated less frequently.  For 
example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is identified in target disease or when progression in bone is suspected . 
 
11.432 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
• Complete Response (CR):All of the following must be true: 
a. Disappearance of all target lesions.  
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to <1.0 cm. 
c. Normalization of tumor biomarkers. 
• Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the BSD ( see Section 
11.41). 
• Progression (PD):  At least one of  the following must be 
true: 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph 
 42 MC1561 
node that was normal at baseline 
(<1.0 cm short axis) and increased 
to ≥1.[ADDRESS_938542] a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the MSD (Section 11.41). In addition, 
the PBSD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm from the MSD .  
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify 
for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the MSD.  
11.433 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions & Non-target Lymph Nodes 
• Complete Response (CR): All of the following mus t be true:  
a. Disappearance of all non -target 
lesions.  
b. Each non-target lymph node must 
have a reduction in short axis to <1.0 cm. 
c. Normalization of tumor biomarkers 
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target 
lesions or non-target lymph nodes 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
• Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be 
true: 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph node that was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm short axis) and increased to ≥1.0 cm short axis 
during follow-up.  
b. Unequivocal progression of 
existing non- target lesions and 
non-target lymph nodes. (NOTE:  
Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion

symptomatic deterioration.  A patient is classified as having PD due to 
“symptomatic deterioration” if any of the following occur that are not 
either rel ated to study treatment or other medical conditions:  
• Weight loss >10% of body weight. 
• Worsening of tumor- related symptoms.  
• Decline in performance status of >1 level on ECOG scale.

13.0 Treatment/Follow –up Decision at Evaluation of Patient  
13.1 Patients who develop PD while receiving therapy will go off treatment and be 
followed for survival in the event monitoring phase (see Section 18.0). 
13.2 Patients who go off protocol treatment for reasons other than PD will go off 
treatment and be followed per Section 18.0 in the event monitoring phase. 
13.3 Patients who are in CR, PR or SD will continue on therapy until progression, 
toxicity or until the treating physician and the patient decide to stop treatment.  
After they go off treatment, they will be followed in event monitoring per section 18.0. 
13.4 Patients who develop non- CNS PD at any ti me should go off treatment and be 
followed in event monitoring (see section 18.0). These patients should be treated with alternative chemotherapy if their clinical status is good enough to allow further therapy.   
13.5 A patient is deemed ineligible  if after registration, it is determined that at the time 
of registration, the patient did not satisfy each and every eligibility criteria for study entry.  The patient may continue treatment off -protocol at the discretion of 
the physician as long as there are no safety concerns, and the patient was properly registered. The patient will go directly to the event -monitoring phase of the study 
(or off study, if applicable).  
• If the patient received treatment, all data up until the point of confirmation of 
ineligibility must be submitted.  Event monitoring will be required per S ection 
18.0 of the protocol.  
• If the patient never received treatment, on -study material must be submitted. 
Event monitoring will be required per Section 18.[ADDRESS_938543] be submitted.  The patient will go directly to the event-
monitoring phase of the study. The patient may continue treatment off -protocol at 
the discretion of the physician as long as there are no safety concerns, and the 
 45 MC1561 
patient was properly registered. Event monitoring will be required per S ection 
18.0 of the protocol. 
13.7 A patient is deemed a cancel  if he/she is removed from the study for any reason 
before any study treatment is given.  On-study material and the End of Active 
Treatment/Cancel Notification Form must be submitted.  No further data 
submission is necessary.  
 
14.0 Body Fluid Biospecimens - None  
15.0 Drug Information 
15.1 Investigational Study Treatment (Ribociclib) 
15.11 Background : Ribociclib is an orally bioavailable, highly selective small 
molecule inhibitor of cyclin -dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) that 
induces G1 arrest at sub -micromolar concentrations in a variety of 
retinoblastoma protein (pRb)- positive cancer cells in vitro . 
15.12 Formulation : The ribociclib drug product is planned for oral 
administration. The available clinical forms are hard gelatin capsules  (10 
mg, 50 mg and 200 mg), film-coated tablets (50 mg and 200 mg) and an 
oral solution (30 mg/mL). The capsules only contain the drug substance; there are no excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  The film-coated tablets consist of drug substance 
and compendial quality microcrystalline cellulose,  
hydroxypropylcellulose, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate. T he film- coating is a mix of compendial quality 
polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, iron oxides, talc, lecithin and xanthan gum.  The oral solution consists of ribociclib succinate in water with a n 
orange  flavoring agent and the compendial excepi[INVESTIGATOR_691989], 
methylparaben, potassium sorbate, and sodium saccharin. 
15.13 Preparation and storage : The shelf life of the drug product is established 
based on ongoing stability studies and may be extended during the clinical study. The capsules and film -coated tablets are packaged  in HDPE bottles. 
The oral solution is provided as 100 mL in 180 mL brown glass bottles. A press -in bottle adapter and oral dosing syringe are also provided in the 
administration kit.  Refer to the clinical labels for current shelf -life, in -use 
and storage conditions for the capsules, film- coated tablets and oral 
solution.  
15.14 Administration:  Ribociclib  should be taken with a large glass of water 
(~250 mL) at the same time each day.  Ribociclib  can be taken without 
regard to meals.  Swallow the capsules  or film -coated tablets  whole, and do 
not chew, crush, or open them. Avoid consumption of gr apefruit, Seville 
oranges or products containi ng the jui ce of each. Orange juice is allowed.   
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : 
Absorption – Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_263578] 1 to 4 
hours. 
 46 MC1561 
Distribution – Steady state was generally reached by [CONTACT_2006] 8 and mean half -
life ranged from 15.9 to 32.6 hours. 
Metabolism – Ribociclib underwent extensive hepatic metabolism 
via CYP3A4 in humans based on in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Following oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of ribociclib in humans (CLEE011A20102), the primary metabolic pathways for ribociclib involved (dealkylation, C and/or N-oxygenation, oxidation (-2H)) and combinations thereof. Phase II conjugat es of ribociclib involved N-acetylation, sulfation, 
cysteine conjugation , glycosylation and glucuronidation. 
Ribociclib was the major circulating drug -derived entity in 
plasm a. No major unique human metabolites were found in 
plasma.  
Excretion – The half -life for ribociclib is 32 hours. Ribociclib is 
mainly eliminated via hepatic clearance, with renal clearance playing a lesser role.  
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions : Based on in vitro data, ribociclib is 
primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4. Based on clinical data, ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) and rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513] (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) markedly increased and decreased ribociclib exposure, respectively. Therefore, drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 should not be co- administered with ribociclib. Patients who receive medications 
that are moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 should be observed for signs of overexposure or potential reduced efficacy of ribociclib, respectively.  
Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors  include: boceprevir, 
clarithromycin, cobicistat, conivaptan, elvitegravir, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, tipranavir, troleandomycin, and voriconazole. 
Examples of strong CYP3A4 inducers include: avasimibe, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
mitotane, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin (rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513]), and St. John's wort.  
Based on clinical data, ribociclib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 
activity. Therefore, drugs with narrow therapeutic windows that are CYP3A4/5 substrates should not be coadministered with ribociclib. Patients taking drugs that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_938544] a narrow therapeutic index should be observed for signs of overexposure of the concurrent medication. 
Examples of CYP3A4/5 substrates with narrow therapeutic windows 
include: alfentanil, astemizole, cisapride, cyclosporine, diergotamine (dihydroe rgotamine), ergotamine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, 
sirolimus, tacrolimus, and terfenadine. 
 47 MC1561 
Co-administration of ribociclib with other drugs that inhibit BSEP may 
result in intrahepatic cholestasis and hepatic toxicity. Therefore known 
BSEP inhibitors should be used with caution during treatment with ribociclib. Additionally, caution is recommended with co- administration 
of sensitive substrates of the renal transporters, MATE1 and OCT2, and with sensitive substrates of BCRP.  Examples of BSEP inhibitors : 
bosentan, fusidate, glibenclamide, lovastatin, sulindac, troglitazone (TGZ-sulfate).  Examples of MATE1 and OCT2 substrates: acyclovir, 
amantadine, amiloride, cephalexin, cephradine, cimetidine, famotidine, fexofenadine, memantine, metformin (also a substrate for OCT1, MATE1, and MATE2K), pi[INVESTIGATOR_8405], procainamide, ranitidine, and varencicline. Examples of BCRP substrates: rosuvastatin and sulfasalazine.  
Prolongation of the QT interval has been observed with ribociclib. Caution should be exercised with all medications that are known to produce this effect. Those known to have a strong signal will be prohibited and others are to be used with caution. Particular attention should be paid to drugs with a possible risk of QT prolongation that are also CYP3A4 substrates. Concurrent administration of these medications with ribociclib may lead to additive QT effects due to CYP3A4 inhibition ribociclib.

15.2  Letrozole for Oral Administration (Femara®)  
15.21 Background : Letrozole is a nonsteroidal, competitive inhibitor of the 
aromatase enzyme system which binds to the heme group of aromatas e, a 
cytochrome P450 enzyme which catalyzes conversion of androgens to 
estrogens. This leads to inhibition of the enzyme and a significant reduction in plasma estrogen levels.  Letrozole does not affect synthesis of 
adrenal or thyroid hormones, aldosterone, or androgens. Patients treated with letrozole do not require glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacement therapy.  
15.22 Formulation : 
Letrozole is available for oral administration as 2.5 mg  tablets.  
15.23 Preparation, storage, and stability : Refer to package insert for complete 
preparation and dispensing instructions . Store letrozole at r oom 
temperature of 77°F (25°C); excursions permitted to 59°F to 86°F (15°C 
to 30°C).  
15.24 Administration:  Refer to the treatment section for specific administration 
instructions. Administer orally with or without food.  
15.25 Pharmacokinetic information : 
Distribution:  Vd: ~1.9 L/kg 
Protein binding:  weak  
Metabolism:  Hepatic via CYP3A4 and CYP2A6 into an inactive carbinol 
metabolite  
Half -life elimination: Terminal: ~ 2 days 
Excretion : Urine (90%; 6% as unchanged drug, 75% as glucuronide

16.0 Statistic al Considerations and Methodolology 
16.1 Overview  
This study will be a single -arm phase II study to determine the initial clinical 
benefit of letrozol e in combination with ribociclib in patients with ovarian cancer 
(Cohort A) or endometrial cancer ( Cohort B).. The primary endpoint will be the 
percentage of patients alive and progression -free at the 12 week -timepoint 
(PFS12) assessed in each cohort separately . The null hypothesis will be set at a 20% 
for PFS12, the rate observed by [CONTACT_692024] a phase 2 trial of letrozole in 
ovarian cancer  (7). The treat ment of letrozole and ribociclib will be deemed 
worthy of further investigation if 45% or more of patients are alive and progression- free at [ADDRESS_938547] of CA-125 
response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), confirmed response rate, and adverse events.  
These endpoints will be assessed in each cohort 
separately.  In addition, this study will also assess a couple translational endpoints 
as well.   
16.11 Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 12 weeks (PFS12). All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment will be evaluable for PFS12. Patients who go off treatment early (prior to 12 weeks) will be considered as  failures.   
16.12 Sample Size:   
The one -stage study design is fully described in Section 16.2. 19 evaluable 
patients will be accrued to each of the 2  cohorts of this phase II study 
unless undue toxicity is encountered. We anticipate accruing an additional patient per arm to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons. Therefore, maximum accrual is expected to be 20 patients per cohort (40 patients total). To account for patients t hat are 
consented and do not meet full eligibility criteria, we anticipate  having to 
consent and screen 80 patients to achieve the maximum accrual of 4 0 
patients.  
16.13 Accrual Time and Study Duration:   
The anticipated accrual rate is approximately3 -[ADDRESS_938548] patient has been followed for 12 wee ks plus time for data entry and clean -up. 
16.2 Statistical Design  
16.21 Decision Rule:  For each cohort separately, the largest PFS12 rate where 
the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population is 20% (7), and the smallest PFS12 rate that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population is 
 52 MC1561 
45%. The following one- stage design uses [ADDRESS_938549] 20% (7).  
16.211 Final Analysis Decision Rule (full 19 eligible patients): Enter 19 
evaluable patients  in each cohort. If 6 or fewer patients are alive 
and progression -free at 12 weeks, we will consider this regimen 
ineffective in this patient population. If 7 or more patients are 
alive and progression- free, we may recommend further testing of 
this regimen in subsequent studies in this patient population. 
16.212 Over Accrual:  If more than the target number of patients are 
accrued, the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_349639]. Analyses involving over accrued patients is discussed in Section 16.35. 
16.213 Data and Safety Monitoring:  
The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The trial is monitored continually by  [CONTACT_692025] 4 and 5 event in real time. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports  provided by [CONTACT_128775]. Any safety issues requiring protocol changes are communicated through protocol amendments. 
Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020]: Based on previous experience 
with this disease, we expect approximately 30% of patients to experience Grade 4+ adverse events.  If at any time, 4 of the 
initial 10 patients or 40% of all patients (i.e., when accrual is greater than 10 patients), have experienced any Grade 4 or 5 adverse event (at least possibly related to the study treatment), accru al to the study will be suspended to allow for a full review 
of the data.  Each grade 5 event will be reviewed on a case by 
[CONTACT_692026] a real time fashion to determine whether study accrual should be suspended. After consideration by [CONTACT_3476] [ie, Study Chair(s), Statistician, Operations Office, etc] and consultation with representatives at the primary Internal Review Board (IRB) affiliated with the Operations Office, a decision will be made as to whether and how the study will proceed.  
16.22 Power  and Significance Level:  Assuming that the number of PFS12 
successes is binomially distributed, the significance level is 7% when the true PFS12 rate is 20% and the power is 83% when the true PFS12 rate is 45%.  
 53 MC1561 
16.23 Other Considerations: Toxicity, qualit y/duration of response, and patterns 
of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries 
or changes in standard care will be taken into account in any decision to terminate the study.  
16.3 Analysis Plan 
16.31 Primary Endpoint: Th e proportion of PFS12 successes will be estimated 
by [CONTACT_437426].  Ninety -five percent confidence intervals for the true success 
proportion will be calculated according to the exact binomial meth od.  
16.32 Definitions and Analyses of Secondary Endpoints (Note:  These endpoints 
will be analyzed separately for each cohort).   
16.321 CA-125 response: The key secondary endpoint of the study will 
be a CA -125 response, defined as a 50% or greater reduction in 
baseline CA -125. The null hypothesis will be set at CA -125 
response rate of 8.3%, based on the response of single agent letrozole, as reported by [CONTACT_692027] (7). The tr eatment of 
letrozole and ribociclib will be considered promising, based on CA-125, if the observed CA-125 response rate is 30% or more. 
This will require at least 6 CA -125 responders in 19 evaluable 
patients.   
16.322 Progression- Free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
registration to the first of either disease progress ion or death 
from any cause.  Patients who receive the study drug, but then 
never return for an evaluation will be censored on their last follow-up date. PFS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier.  
16.323 Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from registration to 
death from any cause.  OS will be estimated using the method of 
Kaplan -Meier.  
16.[ADDRESS_938550] begun treatment will be evaluable for response.  Patients who go off study early before 
having a tumor assessment performed will be considered a failure.   
16.33 Adverse Events : All patients that have intitiated treatment will be 
considered evaluable for adverse event (AE) analyses . The maximum 
grade for each type of AE will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine AE patterns.  
AEs will be  analyzed 
separately by [CONTACT_9084].  
16.34 Translational Endpoints for xenograft experiments: Xenograft will be 
created on each patient with plans for the following future translational 
 54 MC1561 
experiments. For patient derived xenograft experiments, response to 
therapy is based on tumor volumes measured by [CONTACT_2207]; this 
measurement exhibits a standard deviation in the range of 10 to 25% of the tumor volume. Taki ng the high end of the standard deviation, for each 
model we anticipate 5 animals per group (c ontrol or letrozole + ribociclib ) 
will give us approximately 80% power to determine a 50% difference in tumor volume (57% difference for 4 animals)
, with a 2- sided significance 
level of 0.05 . Thus, 10 animals/model will be adequate for this comparison. 
To explore whether the responsiveness of tumors to letrozole + ribociclib  
is not due to either agent alone, additional cohorts of 5 animals treated with letrozole and 5 animals treated with ribociclib, will also be treated for a total of 20 animals/model.  However, formal comparisons will only be 
made between control and combination therapy, and thus no penalties for multiple comparisons will be assessed.  The study endpoint is 28 days 
following treatment initiation. “Response” will be defined as tumors with at least a 50 % reduction in tumor volume at study end. “Unresponsive” 
will be defined as tumors with less than 10% tumor volume reduction at study end. Intermediate values will be defined as “Stable”. Tumor growth curves will be plotted graphically and notated to indic ate the outcome 
status of the originating patients.  End of study tumor volumes will be 
correlated with outcome status of the originating patient as  well.  In 
addition, this study will identify molecular biomarkers associated with a response to treatme nt with letrozole and ribociclib in patients with 
relapsed ovarian and endometrial carcinomas.  Finally, we will determine 
if response rates to letrozole and ribociclib  in PDX avatars correlate to 
responses noted in the patients. For these additional analyses, the Fisher’s Exact test will be used to measure the associations.  All of these 
translational endpoints are considered exploratory and hypothesis generating due to the small proposed sample size for this study.  
16.35 Over Accrual:  If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15901]; however, they will be included in final point estimates and confidence intervals as though they were accrued for  
the final analysis.

17.4 Potential additional translational studies: 
 h as approximately 300 Avatar models of ovarian cancer cases 
that could be tested for RB, P16 and ER, PR, and Cyclin D expression. Ten tumors that 
stain positive for RB and ER and negative for P16 could be tested for the efficacy of the 
combination of letrozole and ribociclib as well as 10 tumors that do not stain with those 
biomarker features. Genomic analysis for the identification of genetic changes associated 
with response in the Avatar tumors  could be pursued. Analysis of the tumors once 
resistance occurs for identification of genomic changes associated with resistance to 
ribociclib (LEE011) could be pursued as well.

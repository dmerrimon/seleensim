positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with a multimodality neoadjuvant therapy of 
preoperative gemcitabine and ABRAXANE followed by 5 -fluorouracil based image -
guided IG -IMRT chemoradiotherapy

    1.2.2  To determine 1 -year and 2 -year overall survival rates  
    1.2.3  To assess response rate by [CONTACT_9661] (RECIST 1.1) and pathologic analysis  
    1.2.4  To assess the toxicity and safety according to CTCAE v4.0 criteria  
     
    
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 2.1 Study Disease  
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the second most common gastrointestinal 
malignanc y in the [LOCATION_002], with an estimated 45,220 new cases in 2013  and an 
estimated 38,460 deaths (1) . This disease continues to have a poor prognosis with a 
median survival in all cases of only 6 months.  Less than 10 % of patients present with 
clearly localized d isease  which is limited to the primary site , while the remainder are 
divided between locally advanced  (27%)  and distant metastatic disease  (53%) at 
diagnosis (2) . The only known curative therapy for PDAC is surgical resection, however 
even those patients who undergo a complete (R0) primary tumor rese ction have a relapse 
rate approaching 90% and a median survival of less than [ADDRESS_1033149] 
margin positive (R1) resections have a median survival of ~1 year, similar to locally 
advanced, unresectable tumors.  Long -term follow -up suggests  that the 5 -year survival 
rate for all cases of pa ncreatic adenocarcinoma is poor at approximately 6 %, and has not 
changed in the last several decades .  An analysis of SEER data between 1991 and 1996 
indicated a 3 year survival rate of 34% for patients who  have undergone curative intent 
surgery (3).   Additionally, the most important predictor of survival in this population was 
postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. As resection is the only potential 
pathway to cure, and there is interest in increas ing the percentage of patients who are 
eligible for resection by [CONTACT_754756].  
 
 2.2 Neoadjuvant treatment of localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma  
Pre-operative (neoadjuvant) treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for 
patient s with localized PDAC presents a number of potential advantages .  These include  
the early treatment of micrometastatic disease, the ability to deliver more intensive 
therapy  to more patients, as well as a means  to identify patients with occult metastatic 
disease who are spared unnecessary aggressive surgery.  Additionally, as the morbidity of 
surgical resection is high, many patients are not able to receive postoperative adjuvant 
therapy.  Therefore, there is increasing interest in delivering this therapy p rior to 
resection.  Several institutions have reported on neoadjuvant chemoradiation using 5 -FU 
based chemotherapy (4) or Gemcitabine based (5) regimens.  These studies and others 
have demonstrated that neoadjuvant therapy is feasible, safe and that resect ion can be 
performed with acceptable morbidity.  However, there is no standard regimen for 
neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer.  Meta -analyses have been performed to assess 
outcomes of neoadjuvant therapy in resectable pancreatic cancer.  One recentl y published 
analysis included 14 Phase II clinical trials including 536 patients.  This analysis showed 
that in initially resectable patients rates of resection following neoadjuvant therapy were 
Revision: 7/24/2020 (Version 6.0)  
 7 65.8% compared to 31.6% in the group with initially borderli ne/unresectable tumors (6).  
Median survival in all resected patients was [ADDRESS_1033150] not 
been done to answer this question. National guidelines such as NCCN support the use of 
neoadjuvant therapy in patients where the risk of margin positivity with upfront resection 
is high (7).  
 
 2.3 Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer  
Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is a unique clinical and radiographic presentation 
described as vascular involvement of the primary tumor which would result in an 
unacceptably high rate of non -R0 resection in the absence of vascul ar reconstruction or 
pre-operative therapy.  Vascular reconstruction is feasible in this clinical setting and 
produces survival outcomes comparable to patients who undergo resection without 
needing vascular reconstruction (8). Seventy -five percent of the p atients who underwent 
vascular reconstruction in this report received pre -operative therapy.  
It is widely thought that i n the case of borderlin e resectable PDAC, the potential  benefit 
of neoadjuvant therapy is an increased likelihood of margin -negative (R0 ) resection, 
resulting in a lower rate of local and possibly distant recurrence, and ultimately increased 
survival.  
 
The definition of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer has evolved over the last several 
years.  The original definition was suggested in a report from MD Anderson which 
described acceptable outcomes for these patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy 
followed by [CONTACT_754757] a median survival of 40 months (9).  A consensus conference of 
AHBPA/SSO/SSAT was held in 2008 and the definition of borderline resectable 
pancreas cancer was further refined (10):  
 Tumor -associated deformity of the SMV (superior mesenteric vein) or PV (portal 
vein)  
 Abutment of the SMV or PV ≥ 1800 
 Short -segment occlusion of the SMV or PV amenable to resection and veno us 
reconstruction  
 Short -segment involvement of the hepatic artery or its branches amenable to 
resection and reconstruction  
 Abutment of the SMA < [ADDRESS_1033151] neoadjuvant regimen to use in this clinical setting . The 
only multi -institutional trial of neoadjuvant therapy to be performed in this population is 
ECOG 1200 (Eastern Cooperative Group), which closed early due to poor accrual.  
Results of this small, randomized Phase II trial demonstrated a median overall survival o f 
26.3 months in resected patients (11).  A recent meta -analysis (including over 4000 
patients) evaluated the outcomes of the available studies of neoadjuvant therapy in 
pancreatic cancer.  Patients with initially resectable tumors demonstrated a resection  rate 
of 73% compared to 33% for patients with initially non -resectable 
(borderline/unresectable) tumors.  Median survival for these groups was 23.3 and 20.5, 
respectably (12).   
 
Because of the real and potential advantages of neoadjuvant therapy for PDAC,  there is a 
pressing need to identify the most act ive and beneficial neoadjuvant  regimen, especially 
for borderline resectable cases.

 8  2.4 Study Agent(s)  
Nab-Paclitaxel ( ABRAXANE ) is a biologically interactive albumin -bound paclitaxel 
combining a protei n with a chemotherapeutic agent in the particle form. This composition 
provides a novel approach of increasing intra -tumoral concentrations of the drug by a 
receptor -mediated transport process allowing transcytosis across the endothelial cell. This 
albumin -specific receptor mediated process involves the binding of albumin to a specific 
receptor (gp60) on the intralumminal endothelial cell membrane, resulting in activation of 
a protein (caveolin -1), which initiates an internalization process in the endotheli al cell 
through the formation of caveolae, with transport of the intact albumin -bound 
chemotherapeutic complex via these caveolae to the underlying tumor interstitium ( 13). 
A protein specifically secreted by [CONTACT_7879] (SPARC) binds albumin, allowing releas e of 
the hydrophobic drug to the tumor cell membrane ( 14). ABRAXANE is the first 
biologically interactive nanoparticle product leveraging this gp -60/caveolin -
1/caveolae/SPARC pathway  to increase intra -tumoral concentration of the drug and 
reducing toxic ef fects in normal tissue.  
 
2.4.1 Preclinical Studies with ABRAXANE  
Preclinical studies comparing ABRAXANE to Taxol® (paclitaxel Cremophor® 
EL solvent -based, BMS) demonstrated lower toxicities, with an MTD 
approximately 50% higher for ABRAXANE compared to Taxol.  At equal doses 
there was less myelosuppression and improved efficacy in a xenograft tumor 
model of human mammary adenocarcinoma.  A t equitoxic doses of paclitaxel, 
ABRAXANE treated groups showed more complete regressions, longer time to 
recurrence, longer doubling time, and prolonged survival. At equal dose, tumor 
paclitaxel area under the curve was 33% higher for ABRAXANE versus solv ent 
based paclitaxel, indicating more effective intratumoral accumulation of 
ABRAXANE ( 15).  
 
2.4.[ADDRESS_1033152] cancer at a recommended 
dosage of 260 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks.  The 
indication for Non -small cell lung cancer is 100 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 
minutes on Days 1,8, and 15 of each 21 -day cycle; carboplatin AUC 6 is given 
intravenously on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle immedia tely after ABRAXANE 
administration. In 2013, ABRAXANE was FDA approved for metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in combination with gemcitabine (see package 
insert, Appendix B).  
 
2.4.3 Clinical Studies with ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer  
Members of the taxa ne family of microtubule stabilizing compounds (paclitaxel 
and docetaxel) have shown encouraging activity in the first and second -line 
treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. More recent retrospective 
data have shown that the use of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy 
including docetaxel improves both resectability and survival in borderline 
resectable PDAC  (16).  
 
Nanoparticle albumin -bound (nab) -paclitaxel (Abraxane) is a novel formulation 
of paclitaxel initially developed to avoid the infusio n-related toxicities of 
Cremophor -stabilized paclitaxel. Its activity in pancreatic cancer was first 
suggested when Infante and colleagues  (17) identified stromal over -expression of 
SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) as a poor prognostic factor 
in resectable PDAC. SPARC avidly binds albumin, resulting in accumulation of 
Revision: 7/24/2020 (Version 6.0)  
 9 albumin – and albumin -conjugated drugs – in cells with high SPARC expression. 
SPARC over -expression is associated with increased response to ABRAXANE  
in head and neck and b reast tumors.  
 
ABRAXANE  has shown encouraging activity as a single -agent, and in 
combination with gemcitabine in Phase I and II clinical trials in the settings of 
first- and second -line metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treatment. A recent 
Phase I/II s tudy of ABRAXANE  and gemcitabine in metastatic PDAC showed a 
median overall survival of more than 12 months, a significant improvement over 
currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (18). To date however, ABRAXANE  has not been 
evaluated in the perioperative setting or  in combination with radiation therapy.  
       
2.5 Other Agent(s)  
   2.5.[ADDRESS_1033153] of care for metastatic or locally 
advanced unresectable disease (19), as well as resected disease as adjuvant therapy (20).  
It is approved as a single agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, but has undergone 
extensive study in combination with other antineoplastics.  Two Gemcitabin e 
combinations have shown a survival benefit in the advanced disease setting; in 
combination with erlotinib (21), and in combination with ABRAXANE (22).  This phase 
III trial demonstrated a median overall survival advantage from 6.7 to 8.5 months and an 
improvement in response rate from 7 to 23%.  Given the significant activity of 
Gemcitabine/ABRAXANE combination chemotherapy in the advanced setting, this trial 
will evaluate this combination in the borderline resectable patient population.  
 
   2.5.2  5-Fluorouracil   
 Fluorouracil is an antineoplastic antimetabolite that is approved by [CONTACT_754758], including pancreatic cancer.  It is commonly combined 
with external beam radiation as a radiation sensitizer for the ne oadjuvant treatment of 
pancreatic cancer (11).  
 
 2.[ADDRESS_1033154] single agent Gemcitabine was reported at ASCO GI in January 
2013.  Van Hoff and colleagues reported an improvement in median overall survival from 
6.7 to 8.5 months and an improvement in response rate from 7 to 23% (22).  Based on 
this data, this regimen i s becoming a new reference standard in the advanced disease 
setting. Therefore, given the significant activity of Gemcitabine/ABRAXANE 
combination chemotherapy in the advanced setting, this trial will evaluate this 
combination in the borderline resectable patient population.  
  
 2.[ADDRESS_1033155] regarding the molecular effects of chemotherapeutic agents 
on pancreatic cancer cells in vitro  and in xenograft experiments, the molecular 
mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy in experimental PDAC and primary human 
tumors is virtually unknown.  Molecular fingerprints of pathways altered in the 
Revision: 7/24/2020 (Version 6.0)  
 [ADDRESS_1033156] been  identified  (23,24 ), however 
they have not yet been correlated with response to therapy.  An initial  study by [CONTACT_754759] -tumoral stroma predicts improved 
survival in patients with metastatic PDAC treated with Abraxane  (18). Recent data from 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_754741] a correlation w ith SPARC and benefit 
from therapy in metastatic disease (27) .  It is still possible that SPARC expression may be 
relevant in localized disease, thus this will still be explored.  Elucidation of molecular 
signatures for response and resistance to therapy  in localized disease  are clearly still 
needed . These approaches have been described and are used clinically to direct therapy 
and provide prognostic information in other tumor types such as breast  (25), but it 
remains  investigat ional in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas .

Resectability is defined as no involvement of non -reconstructable vascular structures in 
the absence of metastatic disease.  
Surgical resection, pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy (based on tumor 
location) should occur within [ADDRESS_1033172] or pylorus -preserving 
pancreaticoduodenectomy may be performed.   
Exploration of the peritoneal ca vity should include evaluation for radiographically occult 
macroscopic peritoneal or hepatic metastases.  Biopsy proof of liver or peritoneal 
metastatic disease (by [CONTACT_665481]) should be considered criteria for 
abandoning planned pancreatic re section.  
Vascular resection and/or reconstruction of the superior mesenteric vein, portal vein, 
SMV/portal vein confluence, or hepatic artery will be done at the discretion of the 
operating surgeon.  In general, vascular resection should be performed when necessary to 
achieve an R0 resection.  
Frozen section evaluation of the pancreatic parenchymal and hepatic (or bile duct)

 [ADDRESS_1033197]  
  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international   
  criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST)   
  guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter   
   (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diamete r in the case   
  of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
    11.1.1  Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity :  All subjects will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  
Evaluable for obje ctive response:   Only those subjects who have measurable disease 
present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease 
re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These subjects will have their 
response c lassified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Subjects who 
exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.)  
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response :  Subjects who have lesions present at ba seline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non -target disease response.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
    11.1.2  Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease :  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorde d for non -nodal lesions 
and short axis for nodal lesions) as >[ADDRESS_1033198] x -ray, as >[ADDRESS_1033199] scan, or 
>[ADDRESS_1033200] be recorded in 
millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Malignant lymph nodes:   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_1033201] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis w ill be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease :  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesi ons, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered non -measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria f or radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) 
Revision: 7/24/2020 (Version 6.0)  
 [ADDRESS_1033202], these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
Target lesions:   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs but, in addition, should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend i tself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calc ulated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used 
as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression i n the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.   Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
    11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken an d recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
The same method of assessment and  the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but ar e assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Conventional CT :  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1033203] slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a mea surable lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness.  
 
Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  This data will 
be collected, but not used for purpose of response evaluation.  
 
 
 
 
     
   
Revision: 7/24/2020 (Version 6.0)  
 28     11.1.4  Response Criteria  
      11.1. 4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm.  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseli ne sum if that is the smallest on study). In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking 
as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
      [IP_ADDRESS]   Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
subject to be considered in comple te clinical 
response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion increase.     
Although a clear progression of non -target lesions only  is exceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], and the 
progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or 
principal investigator).  
      [IP_ADDRESS]   Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
Revision: 7/24/2020 (Version 6.0)  
 [ADDRESS_1033204] response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started).  The subject's best overall response assessment  will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be 
accepted as disease progression.  
Note : Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease pro gression at that time should 
be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

* ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease since SD is  
increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign 
this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised  
 
 11.2 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
Revision: 7/24/2020 (Version 6.0)  
 [ADDRESS_1033205] date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
  
 13.[ADDRESS_1033213] 1.1, t oxicity 
and safety profile (per CTCAE v4.0) and molecular predictors of response and survival.  
The projected sample size is 4 4 subjects over 24 months, with a minimum follow -up of 1 
year following completion of all therapy.  
 
 13.2 Primary and Secondary En dpoints  
    
Primary endpoint:  
Revision: 7/24/2020 (Version 6.0)  
 34 R0 resection rate is defined as macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_754752].  
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
Relapse -free survival at one year , is defined  as the percentage of subjects who are 
without recurrence or death at one year from surgical resection of the primary tumor.  
Overall survival is defined as the percentage of subjects alive at the one and two year 
time points.  
Response rate by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 is d efined as the number of subjects with complete (CR) or 
partial (PR) disease response as confirmed through tumor imaging with CT.  This will be 
assessed following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Staging 1) and following neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy (Staging 2).  
Toxicity and safety profile will be clinically assessed and graded at the time points 
described. The description s and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE 
reporti ng.   Attribution of the adverse event to the study will be determined as definite, 
possible or unrelated as described in Sec. 7.2. 
Molecular predictors of response and survival will be exploratory only, as described in 
Sec. 9.0.  
   
 13.3 Analysis Populati ons 
Intent to treat (ITT) analysis will be used for the primary analysis .  Subjects to be analyzed 
are defined as enrolled subjects who have received at least one administration of study drug 
and have at least one efficacy evaluation . 
Safety analysis set (i.e., those who receive at least one does of the drug or treatment) will 
be used for analysis of toxicity, safety and adverse events.  
Per protocol analysis set (i.e., those who complete the treatment  protocol)  will be used for 
the sec ondary analyses to further evaluate the treatment efficacy.   
    
 13.4 Statistical Analysis Plan  
13.4.1   Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The R0 resection rate will be computed with 95% confidence interval. A [ADDRESS_1033214] will be used to determine whether the R0 resection rate is significantly 
greater than 0.37 at 10% significance level.   The null hypothesis is p=0.37, and the 
alternative hypothesis is p not equal to 0.37.  
 
13.4.2   Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
The expected 1 -year relapse -free s urvival rate, and the 1 -year and 2 -year overall survival 
rates will each be reported with an associated 95% confidence interval. In addition, the 
relapse -free survival function and the overall survival function of will be estimated and 
displayed using a Ka plan Meier curve. The median relapse -free survival and the overall 
survival will also be estimated with an associated 95% confidence interval.  
The expected pathologic response rate will be computed with the associated 95% 
confidence interval using Binomial  exact method. Frequency and severity of adverse 
events will be tabulated based on the actual treatment and the number of circles the 
Revision: 7/24/2020 (Version 6.0)  
 [ADDRESS_1033215] regression will be used to 
associate the Serum CA 19 -9 and SPARC expressi on with overall survival endpoints.  
SAS 9.4 ( SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003] ) will be used for statistical analysis.  There 
is no separate statistical analysis plan and table specification documented elsewhere.  
 
   13.4.3   Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] R ules 
The Simon’s two -stage minimax design  will be used based on the null and alternative 
hypothesis (37% vs. 56%) .  For the first -stage, we will enroll [ADDRESS_1033216] -stage is met , we 
will continue to enroll 25 subjects to the second stage. The new treatment will be claimed 
not promising i f 21 or fewer subjects undergo R0 resection  in all 44 subjects.  A 
determination of study enrollment feasibility will be made at that t ime, and the study may 
add additional study sites as needed.  
 
 13.5 Sample Size and Power  
The R0 resection rate is approximately 37%  for standard therapy. We expect the R0 
resection rate for the multimodality therapy is 56%, which, if achieved, is a clinically 
meaningful improvement in treatment effect.  
We expect to enroll 4 4 evaluable patients to achieve 83% power using a [ADDRESS_1033217] at 10% significance level.  
 
 13.[ADDRESS_1033218] will be excluded from the analysis and recorded 
as such.  Missing data will not be imputed.

Methodology  
 Primary:  
 
A one-sided 95% confidence interval of the total KSS change f rom 
preoperative to 2 years postoperative (2 years - preop erative ) will be 
computed at 2 years  postoperative .  For the non -inferiority comparison, 
the lower bound of this confidence interval will be compared with 63

comparison, the lower bound of thi s confidence interval will be 
compared with 70  points (the expected improvement) . 
 
Secondary:  
 
An independent group t -test or a nonparametric test will be used to 
compare the secondary numerical parameters (e.g. KSS, HSS, KOO S) 
between the JL restoration s ubgroup s at 1, 2 and 5 years 
postoperative ; and a Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test will be used 
to compare the secondary categorical parameters (e.g. postoperative 
stability, anterior kn ee pain  and functional performance ) between the 
subgroups.  In addition, a paired t -test or Wilcoxon rank sum test will be 
used to compare the change  in outcomes  other than the KSS  from 
preoperative to 1, 2 and 5 years postoperative within the Triathlon TS 
Total Knee System group.  The radiographic stability rates, adverse 
event (AE) rates  and revision rates  with 95% confidence intervals will 
be presented in tabl es.

1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study.  This study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Standards, associated 
Federal regulations, and all applicable research requirements.  
1.1 Background  
As the popul ation ages , so does the incidence of arthritis and subsequent  primary  TKR.  
Frequency of r evision for failed TK R increases as well, aimed at alleviating pain and improving  
function  following time-dependent primary implant failure or complications such as i nfection and 
fracture .1  The primary goals of revision TKR are to alleviate pain and p rovide the patient with 
stable, well-functioning TKR through optimal implant fixation and restoration of knee 
biomechanics.  Appropriate TKR biomechanics are established through adequate flexion -
extension gap balancing, proper mechanical and rotational alignment, proper patellofemoral 
mechanics and  restoration of the JL.2 
 
Revision TKR outcomes typi[INVESTIGATOR_421130].3  However, p atient  
expectations of postoperative function, pain  relief  and adequate QOL may not  be adjusted for 
the expected decline in functional results observed in revision TKR .  Some long -term data exists 
to describe the effectiveness of revision TK R.  Sheng et al.4 performed a meta -analysis of 
publications on patient outcomes following revision TKR.  Thirty -three studies with a total 
number of 1356 patients were included in this analysis, which report ed increased function and 
motion compared to preoperative scores.   The main indication for revision reported is  aseptic 
loosening (55%). Other reasons include polyethylene wear (11%), instability (10%), infection 
(7%), progression of disease (4%), osteolysis (4%), bone fracture (4%), component failure (3%), 
stiffness (1%) an d pain of unknown origin (1%).   Instability can be caused by [CONTACT_421142], imbalance in flexion and extension gaps  or incompetence of the posterior cruciate ligament . 
 
There is little existing data reporting outcomes for a single type of  revision  TKR prosthesis, such 
as the Triathlon  TS Total Knee System .  To date, differences between various revision TKR 
implant  systems are not reported in the scientific literature .5  Long -term outcomes data among a 
new generation of revision TK R prosthe ses is needed .

In addition to improving patient outcomes, one  of the challenges in revision TKR is restoration of 
the JL .  Improper positioning of the  JL has been shown to lead not only to instability but also to 
an increased incidence of anterior knee pa in and decreased flexion .6  Malposition may also lead 
to patellar infera and posterior soft tissue impi[INVESTIGATOR_421131].   Mason et 
al.7, in a study of six  cadaver knees, investigated four anatomic  landmarks for locating the JL 
during revision knee surgery – the medial femoral epi[INVESTIGATOR_100757] (ME), the fibular head (FH), the 
tibial tubercle (TT), and the inferior pole of the patella (IPP).   In this  study, the distance between 
the ME and the JL showed ver y small patient -to-patient variability.   As a result, it was concluded 
that the ME is a reliable and reproducible landmark for JL measurements. [ADDRESS_531381] will be evaluated by [CONTACT_421143] > 5 mm and cases with JL restor ation  ≤ 5 mm.   As little as 5 
mm of displacement from the JL can cause laxity in midflexion or tightness, even in a gap -
balanced knee.10 
 
For all cases, a t the time of study surgery, s urgeons will intraoperatively measure, in millimeters, 
the distance  between the M E and the JL in full extension and in  90° of flexion .  This 
measurement will be taken before removal of the previous implants as well as after implantation 
of the final Triathlon® TS Total Knee System.  
 
Additionally, p reoperative and postoperative measurements of JL will be taken from AP 
radiographs, as the distance f rom the proximal tip of the FH to the distal most aspect of the 
femoral component.  When the contralateral knee is non -replaced, the measurement will be 
taken on both sides.  These additional measurements will be  obtained  during independent 
radiographic review to eliminate interobserver and intraobserver error.

1.2 Study  Device  
The Triathlon TS Total Knee System has been developed as platform knee technology for 
Stryker Orthopaedics.  The Triathlon TS Total Knee System , cleared for use under FDA 510(k)  
K072221 , includes femoral components  fabricated from cast cobalt -chromium -molybdenum 
alloy, distal and posterior femoral augments, fluted stems, stem extenders, offset adapters, tibial 
inserts  fabricated from ultra high molecul ar weight polyethylene  (UHMWPE ) and a patella r 
component  also mad e from UHMWPE .  When mated with the Triathlon  TS U niversal Tibial 
Baseplate  fabricated from cast cobalt -chrome -molybdenum alloy  and tibial augments , these 
parts provide a total stabilizing knee replacement.   The Triathlon  TS Total Knee System 
features an anatomic radius and shortened posterior condyles.  These features may allow 
patients to achieve a greater range of motion  (ROM)  and greater stability throughout their  ROM .  
Data in support of these marketing claims will be collected in the Tria thlon  TS Outcomes Study.   
1.3 Preclinical Data  
The f ollowing bench tests were conducted on the Triathlon TS Total Knee System components:

Howard, Michael; Mittal, 
Yogesh and Heekin, David  Among 83 cases enrolled at 5 
sites, 90.4% did not require a 
femoral offset; this is in 
contrast to previous reports 
that femoral offset adapters 
were ne eded in 55.4% of 
cases to achieve optimal joint 
line reconstruction.  The 
authors concluded that the 
design of this system 
inherently reduced the need 
for use of the offset adapter in 
the majority of cases due to 
the anatomic boss position.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of Stryker Orthopaedics.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_421139].  Radiographs will be taken and collecte d in the AP, ML , and M erchant (30° of flexion) 
views for the pre operative, 6-week, 1, 2 and 5 -year intervals.  See Appendix  B for the 
radiographic technique  to be used. 
 
Radiographs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_421144], and subsidence for the tibial and femoral components  of the Triathlon TS 
Total Knee System.  JL measurements will al so be taken according to Appendix A.     
 
Patellar component positioning will be assessed to determine the presence of tilt and/or 
displacement.  Parameters for radiographic failures will follow the guidelines that have 
been set by [CONTACT_421145] .[ADDRESS_531386] heses.   The total produces a numerical score for each 
component.   Failure is defined as a score of 10 or greater, regardless of symptoms.  A 
migrating or shifting prosthesis , with or without the disappearance of radiolucent lines , 
should be considered as  a possible or impending failure regardless of the score.  
 
Performance Requirements  
Radiographic analysis of the femoral component will employ seven  zones  (Zone 1  – 
Zone 7) in the ML  view; analysis of th e tibial component will employ three  zones (Zone 1 
– Zone 3) in the ML view and seven  zones (Zone 1 – Zone 7) in the AP view; analysis of 
the patella r component  will employ five zones (Zone 1 – Zone 5) in the M erchant  (30° of 
flexion)  view.  Radiolucency in at least 50% of a zone and measuring at least [ADDRESS_531387] subsidence without angular 
movement cannot be detected because there is no reference point.15 
 
Surgical Details  
In order to promote efficiency in the operating room, the Triathlo n Total Knee 
Instrumentation was consolidated, color coded and configured in modules that

will be collected to support future improvements.  
 
JL measurements will also be taken  intraoperatively according to Appendix A .  
Investigators  will measure, in millimeters, the distance between the ME and the JL .  This 
measurement will be taken  in extension and at 90° of flexion, both before and after 
implantation of the Triathlon TS Total Knee System.  
 
Intraoperative gap measurements will also be obtained by [CONTACT_421146] -femoral distance of the medial and lateral compartments in full 
extension and at 90° of flexion immediately upon removal of the primary  implant and 
adequate debridement of fibrous tissue down to viable bone.  Once the lamina 
spreaders have been applied within each compartment, a ruler should be utilized against 
the bone to record the distance between the tibia and femur, in millimeters , if the 
distance cannot be read directly from the instrument . 
 
If available  for intraoperative gap measurements , investigators should utilize a femoral 
tibial tensor spreader which additionally allows applied force to be read so that 
consistency is maintained in both extension and flexion.  This type of instrument may 
allow for proper tensing of the medial and late ral ligaments and femoral component 
rotation , to achieve flexion -extension gap balance.  
 
There are numerous measurements required intraoperatively.  Appendix A should be 
referenced for a full summary  on required intraoperative measurements .  The majority o f 
intraoperative data required is not standard.  Appendix A should be referenced in detail 
so that all source documentation is reflective of non -standard data points collected.  All 
surgical details needed for data collection can be found in Appendix F, on  the Surgical 
Details Case Report Form (CRF).  
2.2 Safety  
All operative site events as well as all  serious  adverse events  (SAEs), excluding elective 
procedures,  will be collected and  reviewed against  published data.   It is expected that the AE 
rates reported for the Triathlon TS Total Knee System will be comparable to those reported in 
Triathlon TS Outcomes Study   Page [ADDRESS_531388] -market, multi -center design will be employed.  Radiographs will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_15034].  
3.2 Number of Centers  
Under Version 1.0 of the protocol, c ases were  enrolled at 12 centers in the [LOCATION_002] .  
These centers will continue to enroll under Version 2.0.   The enrollment goal ranges from  15 to 
26 revision  TKR cases implanted with the Triathlon TS Total Knee System per center.  The 
enrollment goal range is  dependent upon the number of participating centers.   Although a 
range is presented, t here is no maximum limit to the number of cases that a center may enroll.  
In the event that a center far exceeds the enrollment goal, Stryker may ask the center to cease 
enrollment so as not to skew the data.  All participating centers will comply with the federal 
regulations regarding patient informed consent and IRB approval.  Non-compliance of a study 
center  may r esult in termination of the center ’s participation in the study.  
3.3 Number of Subjects  
Cases will be enrolled in this study until 181 receive the Triathlon TS Total Knee System as 
required under this protocol .  All cases  will receive , at a minimum : 
• Triathlon TS Femoral C omponent  in a cemented application  
• Triathlon TS  Plus Tibial I nsert  or the Triathlon  Posteriorly Stabilized (PS) Tibial Insert  
• Triathlon TS Universal Tibial Baseplate  in a cemented application . 
The subject’s patellar component may or may not be revised, based upon surgeon discretion.  If 
revised, a Triathlon Patellar Component must be used, and in a cemented application.  
Additionally, a variety of device accessories may be used.  All components are described in 
detail in Section 6 of this protocol, Device Description.

(1 – 8) to accommodate differences in patient anatomy.  The femoral component is 
manufactured from cobalt chrome.  This component features an intercondylar box that engages 
the mating tibial insert eminence at approximately 40 °, depending upon the size of the im plant.  
The interior surface (except for the interior surface of the TS box) is grit -blasted to increase the 
surface roughness.  This is intended to promote interdigitation of the polymethylmethacrylate 
(PMMA) bone cement with the surface texture and appos ing bone.  The superior portion of the 
box has a boss to allow for modular stem and offset attachments .  There are threaded 
attachment features on the distal and posterior aspects of the femoral component  to be used for 
distal and posterior augments .  The threaded attachment on the distal aspect of the component 
also allow s for the use of modular pegs.

9.1 Efficacy  
9.1.1  Primary Efficacy Parameters  
The primary efficacy parameters will be  total KSS, KSS pain score and KSS functional 
score, recorded at 2 years postoperative.  
9.1.2  Secondary Eff icacy Parameters  
The secondary efficacy parameters  will include:  
• KSS pain and function score changes from preoperative at 1, 2  and 5 -year visits  
• SF-36 changes from preoperative at 1, 2 and 5 -year visits  
• KOOS  changes from preoperative a t 1, 2 and 5 -year visits  
• HSS Patella S core changes f rom preoperative at 1, 2 and 5-year visits  
• LEAS  score  changes from preoperative at 1, 2 and 5-year visits  
9.1.3  Primary Efficacy Hypothesis  
For the primary efficacy hypothesis, H 0, the total KSS chang e from preoperative to 2 
years postoperative will be  less than or equal to .  The alternative hypothesis, H 1a, will 
be that the total KSS change from preoperativ e to 2 years postoperative is great er than 
.  When =63 (see explanation in Section 9.4.2, Sample Size Calculation) , the 
hypothesis  will test for non -inferiority.  When =70, the hypothesis  will test for superiority.

This material is the property of Stryker Orthopaedics.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_421139].  9.1.4  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
A one -sided 95% confidence interval of the total KSS chang e from preoperative to 2 
years postoperative (2 years - preop erative) will be computed at 2 years  postoperative .  
For the non -inferiority compa rison, the lower bound of this confidence interval will  be 
compared with 63.  For the superiority comparison, the lower bound of this confidence 
interval will be compared with 70.  
9.1.5  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
A two -sided 0.05 alpha level will be used.  
 
For the secondary efficacy parameters when data is availab le, comparisons of numerical 
variables between subgroups  (e.g. JL groups)  will be made by  a paired  t-test or 
Wilcoxon rank sum  test; comparisons of categorical variables between subgroups will be 
made by a Fisher’s exact test.  
 
One-way analysis of covaria nce (ANCOVA) may be used as a supportive analysis to 
determine if the score change from preoperative  is significantly different between the 
subgro ups after adjusting the preoperative  covariates (e.g. age, gender, BMI), if 
appropriate.  
 
The mean score impr ovement from the preoperative  time point  within the Triathlon® TS 
Outcomes Study  will be summarized in tables  at each nominal visit .  A p-value will be

9.4 Statistical Methodology  
9.4.1  Data Summary  
The following is a detailed proposal of statistical analyses planned for da ta collected 
during the study.  
 
Descriptive statistics will b e computed for all preoperative  conditions and demographic 
parameters.  That is, for continuous data  (e.g. KSS)  the N, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum will be computed.  For categorical data  (e.g. gender) 
the frequency will be compute d.  If appropriate, the data will be presented  by [CONTACT_421158] (e.g.  center).  
 
Descriptive statistics and statistical comparisons for important demographic, efficacy and 
safety variables will be provided in tables.   
 
Statistical analyses will use  SAS® software version 9.1 or higher . 
9.4.2  Sample Size Calculation  
A total of 181 cases implanted with the Triathlon  TS Total Knee System will be enrolled 
in the study.  The mean total KSS improvement expected, as compared from 
preoperative to 2 years postoperative , is 70  points .17   It is assumed that  the mean total 
KSS improvement from preoperative to 2 years postoperative  for cases implanted with  
the Triathlon TS  Total K nee S ystem  will be comparable to the expected rates (not 10%  
or 7 point s worse), above [ADDRESS_531401] deviation of 35 for the 
improvement in scores, 80% power, and a one -sided 0.[ADDRESS_531402] the 10% (7 
points) non -inferiority hypoth esis, a sample size of 154 subjects will be required to meet 
the primary efficacy objective.   By [CONTACT_421159] a 15% lost to follow -up rate within 2 years , 
a total enrollment of 181 subjects will be needed.

[ADDRESS_531408] (HIPAA).  As such, Stryker  will only collect that information which is 
necessary to support the obj ectives of the clinical study .  Stryker  will take precautions to ensure 
that data received is as de -identified as possible.  In the case that some identified information is 
received, Stryker  will ensure that any identifying information will not be reported.  Study subjects 
will authorize Stryke r to use their health information in support of  the clinical study  during the 
informed consent process.  Should a subject choose to withdraw authorization, Stryker  may use 
data collected prior to withdrawal of authorization in order to maintain data integr ity.  
11.3  Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations or other activities 
in a clinical study necessary for the reconstruc tion and evaluation of the study .  Source data are 
contained in source documents .  Examples of these original documents  and data records 
include:   hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinic and office charts, study worksheets, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, subject questionnaires , pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from 
Triathlon TS Outcomes Study   Page [ADDRESS_531409]’s  chart.  This 
includes ROM  values, pain and function , AEs and additional comments.  The informed c onsent 
process should also be documented in the patient chart.  Monitors, defined further in Section 13, 
will be comparing the CRFs against source documents for adequacy.  The monitor s will seek to 
draw a reference between each data  point on the CRF and th e subjec t’s chart.  Thus, one 
cannot derive pain, ROM  or function based on a chart note that reads “Patient doing well.”  
Every effort should be made to ensure  complete source documentation.  
Center s are required to create a source documentation plan includ ing any applicable source 
documentation worksheets prior to enrollment.  
11.[ADDRESS_531410] be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left 
blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D .”  If the 
item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A .”  All entries should be printed legibly in 
blue or black ink.  If any entry err or has been made, to correct such an error draw a single 
straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes 
must be initialed and dated.  Do not erase or white out errors .  For clarification of illegible or 
uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, initial and date it.  
For specific instructions on CRF completion, please consult the Guide to Case Repo rt Forms  
provided under separate cover .  It is recommended that CRFs be completed, signed by [CONTACT_421163] 2 weeks of the evaluation date.  
11.5  Data Clarification Form s 
If errors or omissions are noted by [CONTACT_421164], a data clarification form 
(DCF) will be sent to the center.  DCFs should be answered in a clear and comprehensible 
manner.  If the DCF requires a change to data captured on a CRF, the CRF should be modified 
accordingly.  The DCF should clearly document changes  independent of the CRF to which it 
refers.  DCFs m ust be signed and dated by [CONTACT_093].  It is recommended that c ompleted 
DCFs be returned to Stryker  within 2  weeks o f receipt.  Modified CRFs need  not be included in 
conjunction to answered DCFs.

12  Risk/Benefit Assessment  
12.1  Risk Category  
There are no additional  risks associated with participating in this study over and above that of 
the revision  TKR procedure .  
12.2  Potential Risk  
The study involves the routine assessment of a revision TKR. The device under study has been 
cleared for marketing by [CONTACT_421167].  Assessment 
involves questionnaires, patient and physician  assessments and routine radiographs .  The 
information collected will be kept confidential and will comply with the HIPAA.  
 
Adverse effects associated with revision  TKR include the following:

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of Stryker Orthopaedics.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_421139].  Serious complications may be associated with any total joint replacement surgery.  These 
complications include, but are not limited to:  infection ; genitourinary disorders ; gastrointestinal 
disorders ; vascular disorders, including thr ombus ; bronchopulmonary disorders, including 
emboli ; myocardial infarction and death.  
 
With all implanted devices, asymptomatic, localized progressive bone resorption (osteolysis) 
may occur around the prosthetic components as a consequence of foreign -body reaction to the 
particulate matter of metal or UHMWPE.  Particulate is generated by [CONTACT_421168], abrasion and fatigue.  Secondarily, particulates can also be 
generated by [CONTACT_421169].  Osteolysis can lead to futur e complications, including loosening, 
necessitating the removal and replacement of prosthetic components.  
 
Early and late loosening of total knee components can occur.  Early biomechanical loosening 
may result from inadequate initial fixation, latent infec tion, premature loading of the prosthesis or 
trauma.  Late loosening may result from trauma, infection, biological complications including 
osteolysis or mechanical problems, with the subsequent possibility of bone erosion /pain.  
 
Peripheral neuropathies, circulatory compromise and heterotopic bone formation may occur.  
 
Intraoperative fissure, fracture, or perforation of the femur or tibia can occur due to impaction of 
the component into the prepared femur or tibia.  Postoperative femoral or t ibial fracture can 
occur due to trauma, the presence of defects or poor bone stock.  
 
Metal sensitivity reactions have been reported following joint replacement.  
 
AEs may necessitate reoperation, revision, arthrodesis of the involved joint or amputation of the 
limb.     
12.[ADDRESS_531411] been reported. These include the potential for: injury to 
the knee’s neurovascular structures, loosening of the components, heterotopic bone formation, 
infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, metal sensitivity reactions , intraoperative 
or postoperative fracture of the femur or tibia, and the need for re operation, revision, arthrodesis 
Triathlon TS Outcomes Study   Page [ADDRESS_531412] , this deviation will be promptly reported to both the EC/IRB and Stryker .

There is no guarantee that subjec ts will personally benefit from inclusion in this study.  Subjec ts 
may undergo more thorough screening and follow -up than non -study patients and may benefit 
from this increased surveillance.  This study seeks to provide clinicians information about this 
system/device by [CONTACT_421170]/device to published results for other 
treatments/devi ces.  Information gathered in this study may benefit others undergoing this 
procedure in the future.  
 
Subjec ts will have incentives to return f or follow -up visits through a retention program.  Subjec ts 
will earn points for completing each follow -up visit w ithin the windows outlined in the protocol 
and without protocol deviations.  They will then have the opportunity to r edeem their points for a 
gift (S ee Appendix G , Patient Retention Program).  Use of this retention program by [CONTACT_384] s is 
optional.  
 
The mone tary value of the gifts to the subjec ts is modest and sh ould not unduly coerce them  to 
participate in the study.

monitoring visit.  The monitor will revi ew all source documents and compare them to the data 
contained in the CRFs, in addition to p erforming a periodic review of r egulatory documents such 
as EC/ IRB approvals.  The monitors will need the following when they visit:  
• An area where they can review study data  
• Subjec t case books  
• Patient charts pulled at the center  
• Regulatory documents  
• Time to meet with the SC and the i nvestigator  
13.[ADDRESS_531415] udy information according to a  sponsor’s protocol and standard operating 
procedures and in compliance with FDA regulations.  
 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, 
Stryker  and/or government regulatory bodies of all study related documents (e.g . source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collect ion instruments, study data ).  The investigator 
will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities.  
 
14  Ethical Considerations  
 
This study is to be conducted according to U nited States  standards of GCP s and applicable 
governmen t regulations including 21 CFR Part s 50 and 56 as well as  45 CFR P arts 160 and 
164. 
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independ ent 
EC/IRB  for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the 
Triathlon TS Outcomes Study   Page [ADDRESS_531416] 
of EC/IRB members and their affiliate s to Stryker, if available . 
 
All patients considered  for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and 
providing su fficient information for patient s to make an informed decision about their 
participation .  See Appendix E for a copy of the Model Informed Patient Consent.  This consent 
form must be modified to contain center specific information and submitted with the protocol for 
review and app roval by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB for the study.   The formal consent of a patient, using the IRB 
approved consent form, must be obtained before that patien t is submitted to any study 
procedure.  This consent f orm must be signed by [CONTACT_11581] t or legally acceptable surro gate and 
the investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent.  
 
[ADDRESS_531417] with this study ( e.g. patent ownership, royalties or 
financial gain greater than the max imum allo wable by [CONTACT_1385] ) must have the conflict 
reviewed by [CONTACT_421171]/IRB or a properly constituted Conflict of Interest Committee with a 
Committee -sanctioned conflict manage ment plan that has been reviewed a nd approved by 
[CONTACT_421172].   
15.[ADDRESS_531418] the opportunity to 
redeem their points for a gift  (See Appendix G, Patient Retention Program ).  Use of this 
retentio n program by [CONTACT_421173].    
 
The monetary value of the gifts to the subjec ts is modest and sh ould not unduly coerce them to 
participate in the study.   
Triathlon TS Outcomes Study   Page [ADDRESS_531419] attrition can occur for a variet y of reasons, including a subjec t’s loss of health insura nce 
coverage.  In a case where a subjec t has lost health insurance coverage and no other coverage 
is available, Stryker may, on a case -by-case basis, reimburse investigators for office visits and 
radiographic charges for subjec ts involved in this study in order to facilitate data retrieval.  The 
physician or the office staff should contact [CONTACT_421174] t to discuss 
this possibility and receive pre -approval.  After receipt of the completed data forms, the  
physician must submit either e vidence of coverage denial (e.g. an explanation of b enefits) or a 
letter explaining that the subjec t does not have insurance.  Other visits, procedures, and 
assessments done other than those specified in the protocol will not  be reimbursed.  
Reimbursement may be provided under the following conditions:  
 
• Study subjec ts lose insurance coverage after enrollment into the study  
• An insurance carrier refuses to pay for  a follow -up visit and/or radiographs      
• An insurance carrier ref uses to pr ovide a subjec t referral to see the investigator for 
follow -up  
Under extreme circumstances, and with prior approval, Stryker may reimburse a subject for the 
cost of transportation to and from the investigator’s office for a protocol -required off ice visit.  
 
This policy is the same for all participating study subjec ts and does not bias against any 
particular subject or study cohort .   
 
16 Publication Plan  
 
It is anticipated that publication s of the multi -center study results will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_421134] a peer -reviewed journal at the time the study cohort reaches 2 and 5 years of follow -up.  
Additional publication proposals may be made by [CONTACT_421175].  
 
This study will utilize the guidelines for authorship published by [CONTACT_26399] (ICMJE).  This guidance can be referenced at www.icmje.org .

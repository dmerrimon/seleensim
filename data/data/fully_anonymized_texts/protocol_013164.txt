Version Date: 7/5/2022 Winkelman, John W., M.D., Ph.D.  PARTNERS HUMAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE DETAILED PROTOCOL Efficacy of Suvorexant in Patients with Effectively Treated Restless Legs Syndrome and Persistent Chronic Insomnia: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial  I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor neurological disorder characterized by [CONTACT_252016]. Symptoms are provoked by [CONTACT_9075], relieved with movement, and worst in the evening or at night.[ADDRESS_306383] two times per week, and is associated with moderate to severe distress, is present in roughly 3% of the general population.2 Such sufferers describe these leg sensations on a spectrum from annoying to unbearable and the physical distress and lack of sleep associated with RLS contribute to high levels of morbidity and poor quality of life.3-5 Sleep disturbance is present in over 75% of individuals with RLS, producing most of the morbidity of moderate to severe RLS,6 and is the primary complaint which drives individuals with RLS to seek medical attention.2  RLS is associated with difficulty falling asleep, repeated awakenings, and total sleep times averaging less than 5.5 hours.7  Both the sensory discomfort as well as the periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) are thought to contribute to RLS sleep disturbance. Dopamine agonists (DAs) have been the mainstay of medical treatment for [ADDRESS_306384] size (as change from baseline) is only .[ADDRESS_306385] effectively treated RLS patients with persistent insomnia,13,14 with average sleep latencies over 30 minutes, WASO of 60-90 minutes, and sleep efficiencies of 75-85%. Similarly, iron treatments, which often produce substantial benefits for RLS symptoms, do not produce any improvement for sleep in clinical trials.13  In community surveys of treated RLS patients, 53% report sleep disruption four or more nights per week.[ADDRESS_306386], including activating effects of DAs, conditioned insomnia and poor sleep habits as a result of chronic RLS-related sleep disturbance, and comorbid medical and psychiatric illness.  Another potential explanation is the suggestion from emerging data that RLS and insomnia share genetic underpi[INVESTIGATOR_252001].16 
Version Date: 7/5/2022 Winkelman, John W., M.D., Ph.D.  In the absence of any clinical trials addressing the issue, the persistent insomnia in patients with effectively treated RLS is currently addressed empi[INVESTIGATOR_252002]-approved (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_182954]) and non-approved (trazodone) agents, with varying success. Use of the former category risks the emergence of complex sleep-related behaviors, which occur at higher rates in RLS,17,[ADDRESS_306387] profile may worsen underlying gait instability in older patients. Cognitive-behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I) is generally efficacious for chronic insomnia and is first-line treatment for this disorder.  However, as the sleep deprivation initially produced by [CONTACT_252017]-I is known to exacerbate RLS severity,[ADDRESS_306388] examined orexin levels in RLS patients, with conflicting results.22,23  To summarize, the proposed study is not to treat RLS but rather to address the substantial proportion of RLS patients whose core RLS symptoms are effectively managed by [CONTACT_252018].  Clinically significant RLS is present in 3% of adults, roughly one-half of whom have control of core RLS symptoms with treatment.  Over half of these patients report persistent insomnia, even with substantial control of their RLS symptoms, due to the limitations of current RLS medications.  Thus, roughly 0.5-1% of adults have persistent insomnia with effectively treated RLS.  Existing insomnia treatments can either worsen underlying RLS or lead to complex sleep-related behaviors or other side effects in this primarily older population.  Suvorexant provides a potentially important option due to its efficacy and tolerability profile.    II. SPECIFIC AIMS Primary Aim:  • To determine whether suvorexant will have significantly greater effect than placebo in increasing actigraphically-derived total sleep time (TST) in patients with effectively treated restless legs syndrome (RLS) with persistent insomnia. Secondary Aims: 
Version Date: 7/5/2022 Winkelman, John W., M.D., Ph.D.  • To determine whether suvorexant will have significantly greater effect than placebo in reducing actigraphically-derived wake after sleep onset (WASO) in patients with effectively treated RLS with persistent insomnia. • To determine whether suvorexant will have significantly greater effect than placebo in decreasing Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores in patients with effectively treated RLS with persistent insomnia. Exploratory Aims: • To determine whether suvorexant will have significantly greater effect than placebo for self-reported sleep metrics (e.g., quality, disturbance, sleep latency and duration) in patients with effectively treated RLS with persistent insomnia.  • To determine whether suvorexant will have an effect on RLS severity in patients with effectively treated RLS with persistent insomnia.

In these events, an additional safety phone call will be performed after 1 week at the higher dose (20 mg) in both treatment periods, in which it will be determined whether the subject should stay at [ADDRESS_306392] RECRUITMENT AND ENROLLMENT Methods of recruitment and procedures for informed consent: The target enrollment for the study is N=90 individuals with treated RLS and insomnia. Potential subjects will be informed of the study in one of five ways: 1) through advertisements on the Partners Clinical Trials webpage, 2) through advertisements on Facebook, Google, and Reddit, 3) through referral by a providing clinician, 4) through the RSVP for Health, or 5) through letters/announcements via Patient Gateway. Patients will be identified using RPDR and Epic. We will only send targeted letters and announcements to patients with a diagnosis of RLS. The enrollment goal for effectively treated RLS with persistent insomnia will be addressed by [CONTACT_252020]'s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], as well as the HMS-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], for all of which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_252008]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_252009], and they have conveyed their interest in recruiting for this study given the high prevalence of insomnia in this population.  Interested patients may contact [CONTACT_252021]/clinician (in the form of a small handout). During initial phone contact [CONTACT_252022], interest in the study will be re-confirmed and verbal informed consent will be obtained, after which a phone screen will be conducted by a member of the study staff.  The potential risk of coercion for study subjects will be managed by [CONTACT_252023] a study handout to potential study participants. Potentially eligible patients may separately contact a research coordinator to further inquire about participation. Once the subject has agreed to participate, the MGH study physician will participate in the consenting 
Version Date: 7/5/[ADDRESS_306393]’s record.  Verbally consented subjects will be re-consented during the Screening Visit. Written consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_252024] a written Informed Consent Form including a summary of HIPAA policies; the signatures on the Informed Consent Form will be obtained electronically (via the REDCap e-consent framework). A signed copy will be given to the subject. Once consent is obtained, patients will be assigned a new unique identifier, which will be used to link all questionnaire data with the patient’s record throughout the study. The questionnaire data linked with each unique identifier will be collected and stored on REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), which is a secure, HIPAA compliant web-based application and database hosted by [CONTACT_252025]. A separate database at the Sleep Disorders Clinical Research Program at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_252010]. If subjects have questions concerning their rights as a research subject, they may call the Human Subjects Committee office at MGH, or speak with study clinicians. All study documents will be stored electronically in REDCap as well as encrypted laboratory computers, and access to this information will only be given to the research personnel.  Study Design and projected enrollment: This is a two-arm, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled crossover 2.5-month trial, investigating the effects of suvorexant 10–[ADDRESS_306394] to consent and evaluate for eligibility up to 90 patients in order to achieve our projected randomized sample size of 44 patients with effectively treated RLS, who will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to suvorexant 10–20 mg or equivalent placebo for four weeks followed by [CONTACT_252026] (after a 2 week washout) to the alternate treatment.  Our goal is to have [ADDRESS_306395] them at higher risk of COVID-19-related complications. Thus, considering the safety and mental wellbeing of our subjects, all study visits will occur remotely.  
Version Date: 7/5/2022 Winkelman, John W., M.D., Ph.D.  For the remote visits, research staff will follow the MGB requirements for using the appropriate virtual tools. The study physician will remain on call during all points of remote visits in case there any emergent medical or psychiatric issues.   V. OVERVIEW OF STUDY PROCEDURES Visit 1: TELEPHONE SCREEN (WEEK -4) An initial screen will be conducted over the phone, consisting of a brief clinical and sleep history for inclusion and exclusion criteria.  If preliminary eligibility appears adequate and the individual expresses interest, they will be sent links to complete the following questionnaires on REDCap: 1) the Insomnia Severity Index to assess insomnia severity27 2) the PHQ-9 to screen for depression 3) the IRLS to assess RLS severity 4) the STOP-BANG questionnaire to screen for sleep apnea28 5) an electronic 14-day sleep diary  Upon our review of these completed surveys and diaries, those who meet further eligibility criteria, as determined by [CONTACT_252027] (see Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria above), will be scheduled for a Screening Visit.  Visit 2: SCREENING VISIT (WEEK -2) Written informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_252028]-related procedures (via the IRB-approved Informed Consent Form via the REDCap e-consent framework). Risks and benefits associated with use of suvorexant will be described. At that time, further eligibility will be assessed with a clinical interview conducted by a sleep medicine-trained psychiatrist to diagnose chronic insomnia disorder and to ensure that contraindicated sleep, medical and psychiatric problems and medications are excluded. Urine screens for pregnancy will be performed at an affiliated site; the study physician will order these tests. Phillips Actiwatch Spectrum Plus actiwatches will be mailed to participants, and returned by [CONTACT_252029], at the outset and the end, respectively, of the screening run-in. Actigraphy baseline data will be collected during the [ADDRESS_306396] both day and night at all times except when showering.  Standardized operating procedures developed by [CONTACT_252030].  Event marker button press will establish “lights out” and “lights on” and will be compared with the daily diary times and adjusted if necessary, using written protocols. Sleep onset 
Version Date: 7/5/2022 Winkelman, John W., M.D., Ph.D.  and offset times will be computed using the vendor provided software by a trained technician supervised by [CONTACT_204448] ([CONTACT_252035], the Core Chief). The following key standard actigraphy metrics will be generated on each day’s data: Sleep onset, sleep offset, time in bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), sleep latency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep efficiency and naps. Screening Run-In: They will receive daily email links to an online sleep diary to complete on 14 consecutive days during the screening run-in period.   Visit 3: BEGIN FIRST TREATMENT (WEEK 0) At this Randomization Visit, the 2-week sleep diary will be reviewed for definitive eligibility before the participant is randomized to treatment. Baseline questionnaires will be determined at this visit. Baseline subjective and actigraphic sleep measures will be determined from the last [ADDRESS_306397] did not wear the actiwatch over 80% of the time during the two weeks before randomization, or if their data is missing (e.g. due to device malfunction), the actigraph will be sent back to the subject and he or she will be asked to repeat the baseline data collection period.  Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_306398] 4-week period of placebo or suvorexant. Subjects will be mailed 14 days of the 10 mg dose of study medication following this visit.  Subjects will also be mailed 42 additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_252011] 10 mg dose for use in weeks 1 to 3. Subjects will also be mailed actiwatches, and will be instructed to wear these during the two weeks leading up to Visit 5.  Visit 4: INTERIM PHONE CONTACT 1 (WEEK 1) The study physician will call the participant to inquire about efficacy and adverse events. If the [ADDRESS_306399] the participant to take either one pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (10 mg) or two pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (20 mg) nightly over the next three weeks.  Visit 5: END FIRST TREATMENT (WEEK 4) At this virtual visit, participants will meet with a study physician and the study coordinator. The physician will assess the participant on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale and will also inquire about any adverse events experienced. Questionnaires will also be determined at this visit. Subjects will be asked to mail actiwatches back to the study team. 
Version Date: 7/5/2022 Winkelman, John W., M.D., Ph.D.  At this point, subjects will begin the 2-week washout phase.  Visit 6: BEGIN SECOND TREATMENT (WEEK 6) After the 2-week washout phase all participants will be crossed over to the other treatment for the second 4-week treatment phase. Subjects will be mailed 14 days of the 10 mg dose of either suvorexant or placebo following this visit.  Subjects will also be mailed 42 additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_252011] 10 mg dose for use in weeks 7 to 9. Subjects will also be mailed actiwatches, and will be instructed to wear these during the two weeks leading up to Visit 8.  Visit 7: INTERIM PHONE CONTACT 2 (WEEK 7) The study physician will call the participant to inquire about efficacy and adverse events. If the [ADDRESS_306400] the participant to take either one pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (10 mg) or two pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (20 mg) nightly over the next three weeks.  Visit 8: END SECOND TREATMENT (WEEK 10) During this final virtual study visit, participants will meet with a study physician. The physician will assess the participant on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale and will also inquire about any adverse events experienced. Questionnaires will also be administered at this visit. Subjects will be asked to mail actiwatches back to the study team after the visit.  Compensation: Subjects will be compensated $50 for study visit 2 and for virtual visits 3-8 ($25/visit). Subjects will receive a completion bonus when they have completed the study in its entirety ($50). The total possible compensation is $250.  See below for the Table of Procedures and Study Flowchart.

STUDY MEDICATION AND SUPPLIES Study Treatments: The study medication will consist of 10 mg suvorexant tablets, or matching placebo, prepared in identically appearing capsules by [CONTACT_252031]. The medication will be titrated and distributed according to the following schedule:  Dispensing Schedule: Double-Blind Suvorexant / Placebo Dosing Week Group: Treatment à Placebo Placebo à Treatment [ADDRESS_306403] 7 days. If the 10-mg dose is well tolerated but not effective after one week of treatment, as determined by [CONTACT_71346]-week phone visit, the dose can be increased to 20 mg (i.e. two 10 mg pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]). This will be repeated at the 7-week phone call.  Study Medication Packaging: Medication will be prepared and packaged by [CONTACT_252032]. The medication will be dispensed in bottles containing enough for 14 days of medication after the Randomization visit, as well as enough for weeks 1-3. After the 6-week visit, a 14-day supply will again be dispensed, as well as a supply sufficient for weeks 7-9. Bottles will be labeled with the patient 
Version Date: 7/5/2022 Winkelman, John W., M.D., Ph.D.  name [CONTACT_214457]. Bottles will be clearly labeled as containing 10 mg matching placebo or suvorexant tablets. Subjects will be dispensed the appropriate number of tablets needed until the next medication dispensing date. Study medication should be stored at room temperature 15-30°C (59-86°F), be protected from moisture, and be maintained in a secure area.  Study Medication Accountability and Compliance: Starting at the Randomization Visit, study medication will be dispensed to each subject with instructions to save all unused study medication in order to assess compliance. Participants will be required to show the study team over video how much medication is remaining. Additional bottles will be dispensed to each subject as needed. All study medication dispensed by [CONTACT_214441]. Information about subject dosing and compliance will be recorded in the subject’s study records. Subjects who are noncompliant with medications (according to pi[INVESTIGATOR_214411]) may be removed from the study at the discretion of the investigators.  The investigator agrees not to allow access to the study medication to any person except those named as sub-investigator(s) or clinical care staff and dispense only to qualified subjects participating in the study.  Randomization: Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Blinded treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints.  At the Screening Visit, subjects will be assigned a 3-digit subject number, in ascending sequential order beginning with 001. The subject number will be retained by [CONTACT_214442]. The MGH Clinical Trials Pharmacy will provide and maintain randomization and blinding. Subjects will be randomized to the two crossover groups in a 1:[ADDRESS_306404] and investigator will be blinded to treatment assignment. Subjects will be randomized sequentially as they qualify for the study.  Blinding: 
Version Date: 7/5/[ADDRESS_306405] be documented in the study files.   VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS Medication Side Effects and Adverse Events: The package insert for suvorexant includes warnings and precautions related to the following side effects or adverse events: sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_202904], not thinking clearly; acting strangely, confused, or upset; “sleep-walking” or doing other activities during sleep, such as eating, talking, having sex, or driving a car;  temporary weakness in your legs or inability to move or talk, cataplexy; and diarrhea, dry mouth, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], headache, next-day drowsiness, dizziness, abnormal dreams, and cough. Subjects will be informed of the risks associated with consuming alcohol while taking suvorexant, both at the time of consent and throughout the study.  Subjects will be advised not to consume alcohol in combination with suvorexant due to additive psychomotor effects. Subjects will be assessed for depression and suicidal ideation at each study visit, using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).[ADDRESS_306406] dose of study medication will be reported. Adverse events will be reported to the Partners IRB according to guidelines. Subjects should report any adverse events voluntarily or in response to general, non-directed questioning (e.g., “How has your health been since the last visit?). For each adverse event reported by [CONTACT_423], the investigator should obtain all the information required to complete documentation in the subject’s research file. All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study therapy, must be recorded using medical terminology in the subject’s study documents. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”). The investigator must document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_252012]. All measures required for adverse event management must be recorded in the source document. 
Version Date: 7/5/[ADDRESS_306407] been identified, and all study data are complete.   Overview of analytic plan:  The primary hypothesis for this trial is that suvorexant is superior to placebo in reducing actigraphically-derived total sleep time in patients with persistent insomnia in the context of effectively treated restless legs syndrome. The primary endpoint is the change in actigraphically-derived total sleep time from baseline to the end of each 4-week treatment period. Key secondary endpoints include actigraphically-derived wake after sleep onset and self-reported ISI, and exploratory endpoints include subjective total sleep time and wake after sleep onset, and RLS severity.  Study endpoints: The primary outcome (actigraphically-derived total sleep time) and all secondary and exploratory measures are continuous variables. Primary analyses will focus on the difference from the baseline total sleep time (in minutes) to the total sleep time evaluated in each of the two treatment periods, within subjects. The key secondary variables are the difference from baseline to the end of each treatment period are actigraphically-derived wake after sleep onset and self-reported ISI.  Exploratory analyses will similarly focus on the differences from the baseline value to the final observed value at the end of each treatment period. As these are exploratory analyses, no p-values will be determined other than as described below in the hierarchical testing.  These endpoints include:  a) Diary-derived wake after sleep onset 
Version Date: 7/5/2022 Winkelman, John W., M.D., Ph.D.  b) Diary-derived total sleep time c) Diary-derived SOL, sleep efficiency and sleep quality  d) RLS severity via IRLS  STATISTICAL METHODS Efficacy variables will be analyzed using an analysis of variance model with treatment, sequence, and period as fixed effects and subject within sequence as a random effect. Least squares (LS) mean treatment difference will be calculated from the model. Diagnostic methods will be used for all variables to assess their distributional assumptions and to examine potential outlying or influential data points. This analytical method will similarly be used to assess secondary outcomes. Within-treatment changes from baseline will also be evaluated using a paired t-test for the primary and secondary efficacy variables of change from baseline in total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, and ISI. The primary outcome analysis will use the intention-to-treat principle and include all participants who received at least one dose of study medication and completed at least one week of sleep diaries following randomization.  Per-protocol analyses will be repeated on the subgroup of subjects that achieve 85% medication adherence based on the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_252013]. Variables related to subjective total sleep time will be determined by [CONTACT_252033]. A two-sided P value <0.05 will be considered significant.  Power/Sample Size: Statistical power for the primary endpoint, actigraphically-assessed total sleep time, was estimated from pooled analyses of data from placebo-controlled clinical trials of suvorexant for the treatment of insomnia using polysomnographically-measured total sleep time.21 The difference between 15/[ADDRESS_306408] squares mean change from baseline was 34.7 minutes (95% CI: 27.8, 41.5), corresponding to an effect size of 0.58. Although actigraphy is not identical to polysomnography, multiple studies (including one by [CONTACT_252034]) with insomnia patients demonstrate high correlations between these two objective recording methods for total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency,  particularly when event markers are employed.32-[ADDRESS_306409] size of .58, 34 randomized subjects are required to achieve 90% power to detect a statistical significance level of 0.05. In total, we expect to randomize [ADDRESS_306410] 34 completed subjects with evaluable data.

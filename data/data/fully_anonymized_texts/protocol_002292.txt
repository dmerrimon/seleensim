Title:  A Long -term Study to Assess t he Safety and Efficacy of Lebrikizumab 
in Patients with Moderate -to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis  
Protocol Number:  DRM06 -AD07 /J2T-DM-KGAA  
Phase:  3 
Number of  Sites:  Approximately 200 sites in North America, the European Union  and 
Asia/Pacific region.  
Study Population:  
Adolescent patients (≥12 to <18 years weighing ≥40 kg) and adults who completed the 
DRM06 -AD04, DRM06 -AD05, DRM06 -AD06, DRM06 -AD17 or DRM06 -AD1 8 trial  
Sample Size:   
Approximately  900 patients may enroll in this long -term extension study.  
Study Objectives:  
To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in patients with moderate -to-
severe  atopic dermatitis ( AD). 
Duration of Patient Participation:  
Maximum total participation: up to 110 weeks  ([ADDRESS_162846] injection of study drug at Week 98).  
Study Treatment:  
Lebrikizumab, 250 mg (2 mL injection of 125 mg/mL)  
Study Design:   
Patients who have completed participation in a Dermira - or Lilly -sponsored lebrikizumab study  
(parent study) , DRM06 -AD04, DRM06 -AD05, DRM06 -AD06, DRM06 -AD17 or DRM06 -
AD18, will be offered the opportunity to enroll in this study. This 100-week study is designed 
to assess the long -term safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab for moderate -to-severe atopic 
dermatitis.   
Patients will be considered enrolled once all baseline procedures have been completed and the 
investigator has determined that the pati ent meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two 
treatment regimens will be assessed: 250  mg lebrikizumab, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) 
and 250  mg lebrikizumab, administered every 4 weeks (Q4W). The regimen assigned to each 
patient will be based on the treatment received in the patient’s respective parent trial.   
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 7 For the monotherapy trials, DRM06 -AD04 and DRM06 -AD05:  
 Patients who were re -randomized, in the Maintenance Phase, to either 250  mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W or 250  mg lebrikizumab Q4W will continue to receive the same 
active treatment regimen.   
 Patients who were receiving placebo in the Maintenance Phase will receive a loading 
dose of 500  mg lebrikizumab at the time of enrollment (Baseline) and at Week 2 
followed by 250  mg lebrikizumab Q2W.   
 Patients  who were moved to the Escape Arm will continue to receive open label  250 mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W.   
 Treatment regimen assignment will remain blinded during the long -term extension 
study until unblinding (see Section below ), except for patients from an escape arm , who 
will receive open -label study drug . Placebo injections will be utilized in order to 
maintain the blind and ensure that all patients receive th e same number and frequency 
of injections regardless of treatment regimen assignment.  
For the TCS Combination trial, DRM06 -AD06 : 
 Patients receiving 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W who achieve an  IGA 0,1 or an  Eczema 
Area and Severity Index ( EASI ) -75 response ( ≥EASI -75) at Week 16 will be randomly 
allocated to receive 250  mg lebrikizumab Q2W or 250  mg lebrikizumab Q4W, in a 2:1 
fashion, Q2W:Q4W, respectively.  
 Patients receiving 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W who do not achieve an IGA 0,1 or an 
EASI -75 response (<EASI -75) at Week 16 will receive 250  mg lebrikizumab Q2W.  
 Patients who were receiving placebo will receive a loading dose of 500  mg 
lebrikizumab at the time of enrollment (Baseline) and at Week 2 followed by 250  mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W.  
 Patients who were receiving r escue treatment and were initially randomized to 
lebrikizumab will receive 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W.   
 Patients who were receiving rescue treatment and were initially randomized to placebo 
will receive a loading dose of 500 mg lebrikizumab at the time of enr ollment (Baseline) 
and at Week 2 followed by 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W.  
 Treatment regimen assignment will remain blinded during the long -term extension 
study  until unblinding (see Section below ). Placebo injections will be utilized in order 
to maintain the blind and ensure that all patients receive the same number and 
frequency of injections regardless of treatment regimen assignment.  
For the Adolescent Safety trial, DRM06 -AD17:  
 All patients will continue to receive open label 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 8 For the Vaccine trial, DRM06 -AD18:  
 Patients receiving 250  mg lebrikizumab Q2W will continue to receive 250  mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W  (blinded study drug at Baseline and Week 2, then open -label  study 
drug beginning at Week 4 ). 
 Patients who were receiving placebo will receive a loading dose of 500  mg 
lebrikizumab at the time of enrollment (Baseline) and at Week 2 followed by  [CONTACT_31463] -label  
250 mg lebr ikizumab Q2W.  
 Treatment regimen assignment will remain blinded during the long -term extension 
study  until unblinding (until DRM06 -AD18 study  unblinded) . Placebo injections will 
be utilized in order to maintain the blind and ensure that all patients receive  the same 
number and frequency of injections regardless of treatment regimen assignment.  
Patients who are not already administering study drug at home will be instructed on self -
administration and allowed to inject study drug at home.  
Patients will return  to the clinic at Weeks 2, 4, 16 and every 12 weeks thereafter, through 
Week  100, for safety and efficacy assessments. Patients not achieving an EASI -50 (from parent 
study baseline ) by [CONTACT_10585] 16 , maintaining an EASI -50 response , or not achiev ing clinical benefit 
based on PI [INVESTIGATOR_143177].  
Efficacy will be assessed using the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), EASI and Body 
Surface Area ( BSA ). Patients who have been completing daily pruritus  and sleep -loss 
assessments  and weekly  Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure  (POEM ) assessments  as part of 
their participation in the parent trial  (DRM06 -AD04, DRM06 -AD05 , DRM06 -AD06 , and 
DRM06 -AD18 ), will continue to collect  this information in the long -term extension study  (See 
Appendix  1). Patients who participated in the DRM06 -AD06 study will continue to collect 
daily  topi[INVESTIGATOR_11977] ( TCS) and topi[INVESTIGATOR_73199] ( TCI) use.  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_143204], serum chemistry, 
hematology and urinalysis laboratory testing, physical examination, and vital signs . 
Serum samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis and immunogen icity.   
Patients completing this study or who early terminate will return to the clinic for  a safety 
follow -up visit [ADDRESS_162847] completed the study if he/she has completed all required phases 
of the study including the last visit as shown in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures.  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient in the study shown 
in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures.

immunologic factors ( Werfel,  2016 ; Simon, 2019 ).  
Genetic studies of AD ( Auriemma, 2013 ; Bieber, 2012 ; Weidinger, 2018 ) have shown that genes 
encoding for cytokines involved in the regula tion of the immune system (IL -4, IL -5, and IL -13), 
are strongly associated with the development of AD ( He, 2003 ; Hummelshoj, 2003 ; 
Novak,  2002 ). In addition, variants of genes that encode for proteins involved in skin barrier 
function such as filaggrin (FLG) and loricrin (LOR) are also associated with AD 
(Van Bever,  2011 ). Since FLG plays a central role in skin barrier integrity, loss of function 
mutations of the FLG gene is considered a major contributor to the development of early 
childhood AD ( Bieber, 2008 ; Tanei, 2009 ; Bieber, 2012 ; Flohr, 2013 ).  
Reduced epi[INVESTIGATOR_81183], which represents the first line of protection against the 
environment, is thought to lead to sensitization to environmental allergens, associated with 
elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) (present in about 50% to 80% of all patients with AD, 
particularly in children [ Werfel, 2016 ]) and consistent with the presence in the skin of Type 2 
cytokines (IL -4, IL -5, IL -9, IL -13, IL -25, IL -31, IL -33, and thymic stromal l ymphopoietin and 
inflammation. Type 2 cytokines increase epi[INVESTIGATOR_81184], sensitization, inflammation, 
pruritus and decrease the expression of antimicrobial peptides and the barrier proteins FLG, 
LOR, and involucrin. IL -13 in particular can reduce epi [INVESTIGATOR_143181], LOR, and involucrin ( Kim,  2008 ) and can act on keratinocytes 
in the skin to downregulate their differentiation ( Howell, 2008 ). IL-13 also induces T -cell 
chemoattractants that mediate T -cell infiltration into AD lesions ( Purwar, 2006 ) and may also 
induce IL -5 expression and eosinophil infiltration through the induction of eosinophil 
chemoattractants ( Esche, 2004 ). Increased expression of IL -13 has consistently been reported in 
AD skin lesions and is associated with disease severity ( Choy,  2012 ; Hamid, 1996 ; Jeong, 2003 ; 
La Grutta, 2005 ; Neis, 2006 ; Suarez -Farinas, 2013 ; Tazawa, 2004 ). The ubiquitous presence of 
IL-[ADDRESS_162856] common chronic me dical diseases —15‒30% of children and 2‒10% of 
adults are affected, and the prevalence appears to have increased over the past two to three 
decades (Williams, 2008 ), with some geographic variability. With respect to disease severity, 
about 67% of AD pediatric patients have mild disease, 14 to 26% have moderate disease and 2 to 
7% have severe disease ( Silverberg, 2017 ). Approximately 85% of all cases of AD begin before 
age 5, with up to 70% of  children having spontaneous remission before adolescence 
(Bieber,  2008 ; Hua, 2014 ; Illi, 2004 ).

Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 18 1.1.2.  Clinical Manifestations   
Clinically, AD is characterized by [CONTACT_143205], erythematous crusted eruption (dermatosis), 
lichenification and intense pruritus ( Bieber, 2008 ), which along with the distribution, chronicity 
and history of skin lesions, form the basis for making the diagnosis AD. Flares are frequently 
triggered by [CONTACT_81247], irritants, and allergens ( Bieber, 2009 ). Several 
clinical patterns, with differing distributions of skin lesions in distinct age groups, have been 
noted ( Weidinger,  2016 ; Weidinger, 2018 ). 
The infantile stage (up to 2 years of age) is characterized by [CONTACT_143206] y localized to 
the face, scalp, and extensor aspects of the arms and legs. The lesions are characterized by 
[CONTACT_108135], red, eczematous plaques, erythema, papules, vesicles, excoriations, oozing, and 
formation of crusts.  
The adult stage (from puberty onward s) is less predictable. Affected patients may have had only 
a few outbreaks since infancy, or they may have had a chronic, relapsing course. Lesions 
frequently localize to the face and neck (head -and neck dermatitis), as well in the flexures of the 
elbows and knees, and a considerable portion of patients (around 30%) develop atopic hand 
eczema, which may interfere with workplace activities. Like affected children, adolescents and 
adults commonly have lichenification of the flexures and have facial dermatiti s. 
Patients with AD have a high disease burden and their quality of life is significantly affected. In 
one study, AD was shown to have a greater negative effect on patient mental health than diabetes 
and hypertension (Zuber bier, 2006 ). Patients with moderate -to-severe AD have a higher 
prevalence of social dysfunction and sleep impairment, which are directly related to the severity 
of the disease  (Williams, 2008 ). Depression, anxiety, and socia l dysfunction not only affect 
patients with AD, but  also affect their caregivers ( Zuberbier, 2006 ). Compared with psoriasis, 
another common and debilitating skin disease, patients with AD have lower physical vitality, 
socia l functioning, role -emotional, and mental health scores (Kiebert, 2002 ).  
1.1.3.  Treatment for AD   
The therapeutic approach to AD consists primarily of tri gger avoidance, skin hydration with 
bathing, and use of moisturizers and anti -inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143182] (TCS). In many patients, treatment with TCS provides some measure of 
symptomatic relief but does not al ways adequately control the disease. In those patients who 
have persistent moderate -to-severe disease not responding adequately to TCS, the step -up 
options include topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726] (TCIs), phototherapy, and immunosuppressive 
agents such as or al corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate 
mofetil. Among these, only cyclosporine is approved for treatment of moderate -to-severe AD 
(nationally licensed in many European countries, but not in the US), and its use is l imited to 
patients ≥16  years for a maximum treatment period of 8 weeks. Recently, a clinically efficacious 
and relatively safe treatment, anti -IL-4R monoclonal antibody, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], was approved for the 
treatment of adult and adolescent patients with modera te-to-severe AD. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_143183], 
AD remains a major societal burden and a significant unmet medical need.

Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 19 1.2. Lebrikizumab   
Lebrikizumab is a humanized  monoclonal immunoglo bulin (Ig) G4 antibody (huIgG4) with a 
mutation in the hinge region that increases stability. Lebrikizumab binds specifically to soluble 
human interleukin (IL) -13 with high affinity, and potently inhibits IL -13 signaling through the 
IL-4R/IL-13R1 complex . Because lebrikizumab binds to IL -13 in a non -receptor binding 
domain (i.e., a portion of the molecule not involved in binding to its receptor), antibody -bound 
IL-13 can still bind its receptor (IL -13R1), but the engaged receptor complex cannot be 
activa ted.  
1.3. Study Rationale and Benefit -Risk Assessment   
1.3.1.  Scientific Rationale   
The use of lebrikizumab for AD is supported by [CONTACT_143207] -13 in skin. Moreover, clinical trials 
(a Phase 2a study GS29250 [Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ] and a Phase 2b study DRM06 -AD01 
[Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ]) with lebrikizumab demonstrated significant cli nical benefit in patients with 
AD. Additional detailed discussion of the lebrikizumab studies is provided in the lebrikizumab 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Summary of Study GS29250 (TREBLE)   
Study Design  
TREBLE was a Phase 2, global, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in adult patients (18 –75 years of age) with 
persistent moderate to severe AD, inadequately con trolled by [CONTACT_143208]. The study consisted of 
3 study periods: a run -in period (2  weeks), a treatment period (12  weeks), and a safety follow -up 
period (8 weeks). Patients applied emollient at least once daily and TCS of medium potency to 
all active skin lesions t wice daily through the study. A total of 212 patients were randomized as 
follows: 53 to the lebrikizumab 250 mg, single dose group; 53 to the lebrikizumab 125 mg, 
single dose group; 52 to the lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W group; and 54 to the placebo Q4W 
group.   
Efficacy Results  
 EASI -50 at Week 12 (primary endpoint) was achieved by [CONTACT_143209] 125 mg Q4W, with a treatment  difference between this group and placebo) 
of 20.1% p  = 0.0261).  
 Lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W group demonstrated statisticall y significant differences from 
placebo in EASI -75 and SCORing Atopic Dermatitis -50 (SCORAD -50) and adjusted 
mean change from baseline to Week 12.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 20 Safety Results  
 Injection -site reactions occurred infrequently (1.3% all lebrikizumab treated vs. 1.9% 
placebo) ; all events were non -serious, lasted a median of 1 to 3 days, and did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation or interruption.  
 Herpes viral infections and zoster occurred infrequently, but only among lebrikizumab -
treated patients (6 of 156 [3.8%]); all even ts were non -serious, and none led to treatment 
discontinuation or dose interruption of lebrikizumab.  
 Eosinophil -associated adverse events (AEs) were reported infrequently, but only occurred 
among lebrikizumab -treated patients (3.2%); however, all events were non -serious, did 
not result in interruption of treatment, and there were no other associated clinical 
symptoms noted.  
 Allergic conjunctivitis events were only reported in lebrikizumab -treated patients (8  of 
156 patients [5.1%] vs. 0% in placebo treate d patients); all events were non -serious, did 
not lead to treatment discontinuation, all events recovered or resolved, and all patients 
had a history of asthma. Imbalances in allergic conjunctivitis events were not reported in 
previous lebrikizumab trials.  
 The overall incidence of skin infection (noted in the system organ class [SOC] of 
infections and infestations) was 9.6% in all lebrikizumab arms combined, compared to 
22% in the placebo arm.  
Conclusions  
The results of this trial suggested that lebrikizumab (on a background of mandatory twice daily 
TCS treatment) provided some treatment benefit, as measured through EASI and SCORAD, but 
also suggested that higher lebrikizumab dosing might provide greater cl inical benefit. In 
addition, lebrikizumab was well tolerated with a safety profile generally consistent with that 
observed in previous trials conducted in other indications.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Summary of Study GS29735 (ARBAN)   
Study Design  
ARBAN was a Phase 2, randomized, open -label study designed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of lebrikizumab monotherapy in adult patients (18 –75 years of age) with persistent 
moderate to severe AD, who were ina dequately controlled by [CONTACT_143208]. A total of 55 patients were 
randomized to treatment: 28 to lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W and 27 to TCS.  
Efficacy Results  
 EASI -50 was achieved by 53.6% and 51.9% of patients in the lebrikizumab and TCS 
groups, respectively, with a tr eatment difference of 1.7%. EASI -75 was achieved by 
39.3% and 37.0% of patients in the 2 groups, respectively, with a treatment difference of 
2.3%.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 21  IGA scores of 0 or 1 were observed for 7.1% of patients in the lebrikizumab group and 
25.9% of patients in t he TCS group, giving a treatment difference of −18.8% (95% 
CI: −37.9%, 0.3%).  
 The percent of patients achieving SCORAD -50 or SCORAD -75 showed treatment 
differences of −19.3% and −7.5%, respectively.  
Safety Results  
 AEs were reported for a higher proportion of patients in the lebrikizumab group 
compared with the TCS group (64.3% vs. 37.0%); a higher proportion of patients in the 
lebrikizumab group, compared with the TCS group, had an AE in the SOC of infections 
and infestations (42.9% vs. 25.9%). Upper respir atory tract infections were more 
common in the lebrikizumab group (14.3% vs. 3.7%).  
 The overall incidence of skin infection (in the SOC of infections and infestations) was 
17.9% in the lebrikizumab group and 7.4% in the placebo/TCS group.  
 No serious AEs (S AEs), deaths, anaphylaxis, malignancy, protocol -defined parasitic or 
targeted intracellular infections of interest, herpes viral infections or zoster, or 
eosinophilia -associated AEs were reported.  
Conclusions  
Lebrikizumab was well tolerated at the dose of 125 mg Q4W; the safety profile was generally 
consistent with previous experience with lebrikizumab in previous trials.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Summary of Dose Ranging Study DRM06 -AD01   
Study Design  
DRM0 6-AD01 was a Phase 2b, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in adult patients with moderate to 
severe AD. A total of 280 patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups (in  a 3:3:3:2 
ratio): 73 to lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W (with a loading dose of 250 mg); 80 to lebrikizumab 
250 mg administered every 4 weeks  (Q4W ) (with a loading dose of 500  mg); 75 to lebrikizumab 
250 mg administered every 2 weeks  (Q2W ) (with a loading dose of  500 mg given at baseline and 
Week 2); 52 to placebo Q2W.  
Efficacy Results  
 Statistically significantly greater proportions of patients in each of the lebrikizumab 
250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups achieved EASI -50, EASI -75, or EASI -90 at 
Week  16 than the p lacebo group.  
 A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in each of the lebrikizumab 
250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups had both an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a ≥2 -point 
improvement in IGA score at Week 16 than the placebo group.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 22  The lebriki zumab 250  mg Q2W group had a statistically significantly greater proportion 
of patients who achieved a ≥ 4 -point improvement in pruritus numerical rating scale 
(NRS ) compared with the placebo group.  
 Positive changes in pruritus correlated with positive changes in sleep; the lebrikizumab 
250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups had statistically significant percent reductions in 
sleep loss due to itching compared with placebo (p=0.0459 and p=0.0062, respectively).  
Safety Results  
 The incidences of conjunctivitis ( 2.6% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo), herpes 
infections (2.2% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo), and herpes zoster (0.9% all 
lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo) were relatively low.  
 Four patients (1.8%) in the lebrikizumab groups and 2 patients (3.8%) in the placebo 
group had an SAE. Those reported in the lebrikizumab groups were  
o severe chest pain (1  patient in the 250 mg Q2W group)  
o severe hernial eventration (1 patient in the 125 mg Q4W group)  
o femur fracture of moderate severity (1 patient in the 125 mg Q4W group), and  
o panic attack of moderate severity (1  patient in the 250 mg Q2W group).  
Those reported in the placebo group were severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
severe edema peripheral, and severe pulmonary embolism. All SAEs were considered by 
[CONTACT_143210].   
 Most AEs were considered not related to study drug; those considered related were 
reported for 16.2% of patients in the lebrikizumab groups and 5.8% of patients in the 
placebo group  
Conclusions  
This Phase 2b study showed that higher doses of lebrikizumab provided greater clinical benefit. 
All lebrikizumab doses induced statistically significant reductions in EASI scores compared to 
placebo, and a goo d dose response was observed for all primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints. The best response for all endpoints was observed with the highest lebrikizumab dose 
(250 mg Q2W), although the next highest dose (250 mg Q4W) also induced significant 
improv ement in virtually all endpoints. All doses of lebrikizumab were well tolerated, without a 
dose response noted; AEs were generally mild or moderate and considered unrelated to study 
drug. These results provided the basis for dose selection for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies.

Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 23 [IP_ADDRESS].  Summary of DRM06 -AD03 Phase 1 PK Study   
Study Design  
DRM06 -AD03 was a Phase 1, randomized, parallel -group study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of lebrikizumab in healthy adult volunteers (18 to 45 years of 
age, inclusive). A total of 41 subjects were randomized as follows: 21 subjects received two 
1-mL (125 mg) subcutaneous ( SC) injections and 20 subjects received one 2 -mL (250 mg) SC 
injection. The primary objective was to compare the PK (AUC, C max) of the 2 lebrikizumab 
dosing regimens. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 15, 29, 
43, 57, 71, 85 and 99 for PK and Day 29, 43, 57, 71, 85 and 99 for anti -drug ant ibodies (ADA).  
Pharmacokinetic Results  
For each AUC comparison (i.e., AUC last, AUC inf, and AUC 0-57d) geometric mean ratios were 
close to 1 with 90% CIs within the range of 80% to 125%, except for AUC inf, which was just 
above the upper bound, with a value of 132%. The C max geometric mean ratio was 0.89 with a 
90% CI of 73% –108%.  
Conclusions  
Both the AUC and C max results indicated similar overall exposure between the 2 lebrikizumab 
dosing regimens evaluated in this study, i.e., two 1 -mL (125 mg) SC injections versus one 2 -mL 
(250 mg) SC injection. Data from this study support the use of the 2 -mL (250 mg) pre -filled 
syringe with a pre -assembled needle safety device (PFS -NSD) in the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518].  
1.4. Rationale for Dose and Treatment Regimen   
For the Phase 3 development program, a dosin g regimen  of 500 mg loading dose at baseline and 
Week 2, followed by 250 mg Q2W lebrikizumab was selected for study in the Induction Period 
(baseline to Week 16), based on an evaluation of safety, efficacy and PK data from the 
DRM06 -AD01 and DRM06 -AD03 tri als (Sections  [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] ). The DRM06 -AD03 PK 
study conducted in healthy adults demonstrated that a single SC injection of 2 -mL (250 mg) of 
lebrikizumab delivered comparable levels of lebrikizumab as did two 1 -mL (125 mg) SC 
injections. This simulated the conditions under which study dru g will be administered in Phase 3, 
further supporting the dose and treatment regimen for Phase 3 trials, lebrikizumab 250  mg Q2W 
with a loading dose of 500  mg given at Baseline and Week 2.  
Following Induction, the Phase 3 development program will assess t he long term safety and 
efficacy of both a 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W dosing regimen and a 250 mg lebrikizumab Q4W 
dosing regimen in order to determine whether one or both regimens, one which involves less 
frequent dosing, might be effective in maintaining di sease control over an extended period of 
time.  
Adolescent Patients  
In this Phase 3 study, adolescent patients (≥12  to <18 years weighing  ≥40 kg), will be included 
and will receive the same doses of lebrikizumab described above for adults. The justification for 
this approach is as follows:  
Approved on [ADDRESS_162857] similar efficacy outcomes in response to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] ( Simpson, 2018 ; 
Treister, 2019 ). Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations of lebrikizumab dosing (population 
PK modeling of pooled data from 2259 adult asthma patients and a subsequent external posterior 
predictive check with lebrikizumab PK data from the DRM06 -AD01 trial in adult AD patients) 
revealed similar kinetics for adults and adolescent patients, 12 to <18 years of age. The maximal 
exposures are predicted to be slightly (≤ 35%) higher in adolescent patients than in adults for any 
given dose due to the lower adolescent weight  ranges and lebrikizumab exposure dependence on 
weight; however, the safety profile in adolescent patients, based on the exposure -response 
relationship analysis and on partial extrapolation, is comparable to that observed in adults.

3.1. Duration of the Study   
The maximum  duration of a patient’s participation in this study will be  up to  110 weeks  ([ADDRESS_162861] injection of study drug at 
Week 98).  
3.2. Study Population and Number of Patients   
Approximately [ADDRESS_162862] meet all the following criteria to be eligible for this study:  
1. Received treatment in a Dermira - or Lilly -sponsored lebrikizumab s tudy, DRM06 -AD04, 
DRM06 -AD05, DRM06 -AD06, DRM06 -AD17 or DRM06 -AD18  (parent trial) and have 
adequately completed the study treatments and last patient visit of the parent trial.  
2. Willing and able to comply with all clinic visits and study -related procedures . 
3. For women of childbearing potential: agree to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use a highly effective contraceptive method during the 
treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_162863] dose of lebrikizumab or placebo.  
NOTE: A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as a postmenarcheal 
female, who has not reached a postmenopausal state (  12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause) and has not undergone 
surgical sterilizat ion (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).  
NOTE: The following are highly effective contraceptive methods: combined (estrogen 
and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, progest ogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, 
injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine device (IUD), 
intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, bilateral tubal 
ligation, vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence.  The reliability of sexual abstinence 
should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  
If the highly effective contraceptive methods are contraindicated or strictly declined by 
[CONTACT_102], acceptable birth control methods may be considered. The se may include a 
combination of the following methods:  
• male or female condom with spermicide  and 
• cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide .

discontinuation date, indication, and reaso n for use will be recorded.  
 The use of any concomitant medication must relate to an AE listed on the AE electronic 
case report form ( eCRF ) or the patient's medical history unless it is a supplement or used 
as preventative care.  
6.1. Permitted and Prohibited Tr eatments and Procedures   
The use of concomitant medications for other medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, 
acute infections) is permitted during this study. Inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators to 
control asthma are permitted.  
Acute severe infections can be treated with systemic antibiotics, use of which must be recorded 
in the eCRF. However, chronic treatment with systemic antibiotics is not permitted.  
Live or live attenuated vaccines are not permitted  during the trial , but if taken, please contact 
[CONTACT_143213] [ADDRESS_162866] vaccination . 
The use of a tanning booth/parlor is not permitted during the trial.  
Planned or anticipated major medical procedures or surgeries should be avoided during the trial.  
See Section  6.3 for details on approved AD medications and timing of use.  
6.2. Moisturizers   
Non-medicated moisturizers are to be used during the study. Patient s may continue  to use  her/his 
current over -the-counter moisturize r regimen, if approved by [CONTACT_737].  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 35 6.3. Treatment s for AD   
Intermittent use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_143188] (e.g., TCS, TCIs and PDE4 inhibitors) for AD is 
permitted for the tr eatment of disease flares during the trial.  
Patients coming from the TCS combination trial  DRM06 -AD06  and still on TCS use at the end 
of the parent study, may taper or stop TCS use, as needed. If AD lesions return or a patient 
experiences a flare, TCS trea tment may be resumed at the patient’s discretion. For patients 
coming from DRM06 -AD06,  TCS and TCI use will be recorded daily by [CONTACT_143214] , as indicated in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures  (Appendix  1). 
Patients who may require short -term systemic treatment for symptoms of AD will be assessed on 
a case -by-case basis and must be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to initiating 
treatmen t.  
The introduction of medications or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143189] 
(e.g., mycophenolate -mofetil, IFN -y, Janus kinase inhibitors, cyclosporine, azathioprine, 
methotrexate, phototherapy, or photochemotherapy ) are not permitted d uring the study.  Extended 
use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of AD are prohibited and require permanent 
discontinuation of Investigational Product. They may be used only for the treatment of an AE 
(for example, worsening of existing conditio n, such as asthma flare). If used for >30 days, 
sponsor approval is required for the patient to remain in the study.  
Additional drugs are to be avoided du ring the study unless required to treat an AE or for the 
treatment of an ongoing medical problem. If t he need for concomitant medica tion arises, the 
investigato r should base decisions on the patient and clinica l factors. Any additional medi cation 
(including the limited use of therapeutic agent s which, if used under treatment reg imens other 
than for treatme nt an AE or for appropriate medical management, might be considered  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) 
whether prescription or over -the-counter, used at baseline and/or during the course  of the study, 
must be documented with the start and stop dates .  
Patients requiring long -term systemic treatment for symptoms of AD (e.g., non -responders) must 
be discontinued from the study.   
Cannabinoid treatments for AD are prohibited.  All medication use d for AD must be recorded in 
the eCRF.

8.1. Assessment of Efficacy   
Each patient’s AD will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures. 
Whenever possible, the same assessor should perform all assessments on a given patient.  
8.1.1.  Investigator Global Assessment (IGA)   
The IGA  is an instrument used to globally rate the severity of the patient’s AD and is based on a 
5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The IGA score is selected using the descriptors 
below that best desc ribe the overall appearance of the lesions at a given time point. It is not 
necessary that all characteristics under morphological description be present.  Assessors must be 
trained and certified by [CONTACT_143215]. The IGA m ust be 
conducted prior to conducting the EASI  and BSA assessments.   
8.1.2.  Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)

8.1.3.  Body Surface Area (BSA)   
The BSA assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin involvement with respect to AD and 
is expressed as a percentage of total body surface. BSA will be determined by [CONTACT_143217] = 1% rule.  Assessors must be trained and certified by [CONTACT_143218].  
8.1.4.  Pruritus   
Pruritus will continue to be assessed by [CONTACT_143219] s who evaluated pruritus as part of their parent 
trial participation using the same patient reported outcome instrument, the  Pruritus Numerical 
Rating Scale (NRS). The Prur itus NRS is an [ADDRESS_162869] 24 hours with 0 indicating “No itch” and 10 indicating “Worst itch 
imaginable.”  Assessments will be recorded daily by [CONTACT_143220] 52 . Data will be transferred to the clinical database.  
8.1.5.  Sleep -Loss   
Sleep -loss due to pruritus will continue to be assessed by [CONTACT_143221] -loss as 
part of their parent trial participation using the same patient reported outcome instrument. 
Patients rate their sleep based on a 5 -point Likert scale [0 (not at all) to 4 (unable to sleep at all)]. 
Assessments will be recorded daily by [CONTACT_143222] 52 . 
Data will be transferred to the clinical database.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 45 8.1.6.  Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)   
POEM will continue to be assessed by [CONTACT_143223] a POEM assessment as part of 
their parent trial participation using the same patient reported outcome instrument. The POEM is 
a 7-item, validated, questionnaire used by [CONTACT_143224]. Patients are asked t o respond to questions on skin dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep 
loss, bleeding and weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. All answers carry equal weight with a total possible score from 0 to 
28 (answers scored as: No days=0; 1‒ 2  days = 1; 3 -4 days = 2; 5‒6 days = 3; everyday  = 4). 
A high score is indicative of a poor quality of life. POEM responses will be captured using an 
electronic diary  through Week 52, then captured at site visits starting at Week 64,  and transferred 
into the clinical database.  
8.1.7.  Skin Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)   
Skin Pain NRS (Newton et al. 2019) is a patient -administered, validated, 11 -point horizontal 
scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing “no pain” and 10 represen ting “worst pain 
imaginable.” Overall severity of a patient’s skin pain is indicated by [CONTACT_143225] [ADDRESS_162870] the Skin Pain NRS assessments daily using an electronic diary at home through Week 
52, as indicated in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures (Appendix  1).  
8.2. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
8.2.1.  Physical Examination   
A complete physical examination will be  conducted at baseline and at end -of-treatment and will 
cover general appearance, dermatological, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
cardiovascular, abdominal, neurological, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic body systems. Height 
and weight will also  be recorded.  
At other study visits, a symptom -directed physical examination may be conducted at the 
discretion  of the Investigator .  
8.2.2.  Vital Signs   
Vital signs, including body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breath per minute), pulse (beats per 
minute), and blood pressure (mmHg), will be obtained with the patient in the seated position, 
after sitting for at least [ADDRESS_162871] chemistry panel (including liver -function tests), total 
cholesterol, standard urine testing, urine pregnancy test for women who are not po st-menopausal 
Approved on [ADDRESS_162872] dose of study intervention should be repeated until 
the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_63200].  
 If such values do not return to normal  or baseline within a period  of time judged 
reasonable by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified and the sponsor 
notified.  
 All protocol -required laboratory assessments must be conducted in accordance 
with the laboratory manual and Appendix  1. 
If laboratory values from non -protocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are 
conside red clinically significant by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the clinically significant results will be reported as an AE in the AE 
section of the eCRF.  
Blinding of laboratory test results  
Laboratory results that could unblin d the study will not be reported to investigative sites or other 
blinded personnel.

8.2.4.  Adverse  Events   
AEs will be monitored throughout the study. Patients will be instructed to inform the Investigator 
and/or study staff of any AEs. At each visit, patients will be asked ab out AEs in a non -specific 
manner using open -ended questions so as not to bias the response (e.g., How have you been 
since the last visit?). Specific inquiry regarding reported AEs will be conducted when applicable. 
All AEs will be documented and recorded i n the patient’s eCRF.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 48 Any patient who has an AE (serious or non -serious) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_143226](s) return to normal or to clinically acceptable levels, as 
judged by [CONTACT_737]. A physician, ei ther at clinical site, or at a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_121376], will administer treatment for any serious AEs (SAEs), if necessary. When appropriate, 
medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution of event(s).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting   
AEs that are ongoing at the  exit visit of the parent trial will be carried over and followed.  New 
AEs occurring from the time of consent to the end of study w ill be reported in the AE sectio n of 
the eCRF. All AEs will be individually recorded in the eCRF. Any condition present prior to 
administration of study drug and that worsens after administration of study drug should be 
reported as an AE. Information regarding the onset, duration, severi ty, action taken, outcome, 
and relationship to study drug will be recorded.  
New or worsening abnormal laboratory values and/or vital signs are to be recorded as AEs if 
they are considered to be of clinical significance by [CONTACT_143227]  [IP_ADDRESS] . Unless a diagnosis is available, signs and symptoms must 
be reported as individual AEs in the eCRF; a diagnosis is preferred.  
The severity of an AE will be designated as mild, moderate or severe. The term “severe” is used 
to describe the intensity of an  AE; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor clinical 
significance (e.g., ‘severe’ upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]). Severity is not the same as “serious”. 
Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome/action of an AE. (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
The relationship of the AE to the study treatment should be determined by [CONTACT_143228]:  
Not related : The AE is judged to not be associated with the study drug and is attributable to 
another cause.  
Related:  A causal relationship between the AE and the study drug is a reasonable possibility, 
i.e., there is evidence (e.g., dechallenge/rechallenge) or other clinical arguments to  suggest a 
causal relationship between the AE and study treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)   
The following treatment emergent adverse events are being designate d adverse events of special 
interest (AESI):  
 conjunctivitis  
 herpes infection or zoster  
 parasitic infection or an infection related to an intracellular pathogen  
AESIs should be reported to the Sponsor or designee. Additional data will be collected for AESIs  
in the eCRF . Patient records must include any follow -up information regarding these AESIs.  
Approved on [ADDRESS_162873] of the patient.  The investigator or designee may 
discuss discontinuation of study drug or dose changes with the Sponsor or designee prior to 
implementation.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)   
An SAE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that,  
 Results in death  
 Is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_16737] (i.e., the patient is at 
immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
sever e form, might have caused death)  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1666]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening, result 
in death, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on appropriate medical judgment, it 
jeopardizes the patient, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse . 
The Investigator should institute any clinically necessary supplementary investigation of SAE 
information. In the case of patient death, any post -mortem findings/reports will be requested.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting of SAEs   
All SAEs, as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the 
Sponsor or design ee within 24  hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. As soon as 
the Investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the criteria for an SAE, the SAE should be 
documented to the extent that information is available.  
SAEs will be recorded from  the time of informed consent/assent until the end of the study. 
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], an SAE occurring outside the specified time window  
(i.e., following patient completion or terminations of the study) is deemed to be drug -related, the  
event should be reported with [ADDRESS_162874] be recorded on an SAE form. The minimum information required for SAE reporting 
includes the identity of the Principal Investigator ( PI), site number, patient number, event 
description, SAE term(s), reason why the event is considered serious (i.e., the seriousness 
criteria), and PI’s assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug. Additional SAE 
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 50 information including medications or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, and the 
outcom e/resolution of the event should also be recorded on the SAE form.   
In all cases, the Investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all 
material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the SAE. The Investigator may be 
required to provide supplementary information as requested by [CONTACT_4885].  
When reporting SAEs, the following additional points should be considered:  
 Although signs, symptoms, and tests that support the diagnosis of an SAE should be 
provided,  the Investigator should report the diagnosis or syndrome as the SAE term.  
 Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE (unless the 
event preceding the death is unknown). If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy report 
should  be provided.  
Although most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143190], some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143191]:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143192], or for a procedure for a 
pre-existing condition that has not worsened after administr ation of study drug (e.g., a 
previously scheduled ventral hernia repair). SAEs must, however, be reported for any 
surgical or procedural complication that lead to prolongation of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 Events that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143193] <24 hours and that do not require a 
therapeutic intervention/treatment (e.g., an emergency room visit for hematuria that 
results in a diagnosis of cystitis and discharge to home on oral antibiotics).  
The Sponsor will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are received. For each 
SAE received, the Sponsor will determine whether the criteria for expedited reporting to relevant 
regulatory authorities have been met.  
The Sponsor will assess th e likelihood that each SAE is related to study treatment, with the 
current Investigator’s Brochure used as the reference document to assess expectedness of the 
event to study drug.  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_11012] a SAE is essentia l so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority an d other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards ( IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees 
(IEC), and investigators.  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file 
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 51 it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate , according 
to local requirements.  
8.2.5.  Pregnancy   
The investigator should notify the Sponsor immediate ly regarding a pregnancy in a (1) female 
clinical trial patient or (2) female partner of a male clinical trial patient.  
Pregnant female patients must be withdrawn from study drug.  
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant by [CONTACT_143229], the male patient will be advised by [CONTACT_143230].  
The Investigator must perform medical assessments as clinically indicated and continue to follow 
the patient for ≥[ADDRESS_162875] bilirubin , GGT, 
and CK should be repeated within 48 to 72 hours, to confirm the abnormality and to determine 
whether it is increasing or decreasing, if these conditions occur:  
If a participant with baseline...  has the following elevations:  
ALT or AST <1.[ADDRESS_162876] ≥[ADDRESS_162877]  
ALP <1.[ADDRESS_162878]  ALP ≥[ADDRESS_162879]  
TBL <1.[ADDRESS_162880]  TBL ≥[ADDRESS_162881] ≥1.[ADDRESS_162882] ≥2 times baseline  
ALP ≥1.[ADDRESS_162883]  ALP ≥2 times baseline  
TBL ≥1.[ADDRESS_162884]  TBL ≥ 1.5 times  baseline (except for patients with 
Gilbert’s syndrome)  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 52 If the abnormality persists or worsens, clinical and laboratory monitoring and evaluation for the 
possible  causes of the abnormal liver tests should be initiated by [CONTACT_143231]’s designated medical monitor. At a minimu m, this evaluation should include a 
physical examination and a thorough medical history, including symptoms, recent illnesses (for 
example, heart failure, systemic infection, hypotension, or seizures), recent travel, history of 
concomitant medications (inc luding over -the-counter), herbal and dietary supplements, history of 
alcohol  drinking, and other substance abuse.  
Initially, monitoring of symptoms and hepatic biochemical tests should be done at a frequency of 
one to three  times weekly, based on the parti cipant’s clinical condition and hepatic biochemical 
tests. Subsequently, the frequency of monitoring may be lowered to once every 1 to 2 weeks, if 
the participant’s clinical condition and lab results stabilize. Monitoring of ALT, AST, ALP, and 
TBL should c ontinue until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline levels.  
Comprehensive hepatic evaluation  
A comprehensive  evaluation should be performed to search for possible causes of liver injury if 
these conditions occur:  
If a participant with baseline ... has the following elevations:  
ALT or AST <1.[ADDRESS_162885] ≥[ADDRESS_162886] with hepatic signs  or symptoms*, or  
ALT or AST ≥[ADDRESS_162887]  
ALP <1.[ADDRESS_162888]  ALP ≥[ADDRESS_162889]  
TBL <1.[ADDRESS_162890]  TBL ≥[ADDRESS_162891] ≥1.[ADDRESS_162892] ≥2 times baseline with hepatic signs  or symptoms*, or 
ALT or AST ≥3 times baseline  
ALP ≥1.[ADDRESS_162893]  ALP ≥2 times baseline  
TBL ≥1.[ADDRESS_162894]  TBL ≥ 2 times  baseline , except for patients with Gilbert’s syndrome  
*Hepatic signs  or symptoms are severe  fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, 
fever, and/or rash.  
At a minimum, this evaluation should include a physical examination and a thorough medical 
history, as outlined above , as well as tests for prothrombin -time/INR (PT-INR); viral hepatitis A, 
B, C, and E; tests for autoimmune hepatitis ; and an abdominal imaging study , for example, 
ultrasound  or CT scan.  
Based on the participant’s history and initial results, further testing should be considered in 
consultation with the sponso r’s designated medical monitor, including tests for hepatitis D virus, 
cytomegalovirus, Epstein -Barr virus, acetaminophen levels, acetaminophen  protein adducts, 
urine toxicology screen, Wilson’s disease, blood alcohol levels, urinary ethyl  glucuronide, and  
serum phosphatidylethanol.  
Based on the circumstances and the investigator’s assessment of the participant’s clinical 
condition, the investigator should consider referring the participant for a 
hepatologist/ gastroenterologist  consultation, magnetic resona nce cholangiopancreatography, 
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, cardiac echocardiogram, or a liver biopsy.

Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 53 [IP_ADDRESS].  Additional Hepatic Data Collection in Participants Who have Abnormal Liver 
Tests during the Study   
Additional  hepatic safety data collection (hepatic safety eCRF) should be performed for 
participants  who meet one or more of the following conditions:  
 Elevation of serum ALT to ≥[ADDRESS_162895] on two or more consecutiv e blood tests , if 
baseline ALT is <1.[ADDRESS_162896]  
o In participants with baseline ALT ≥1.[ADDRESS_162897], the threshold is ALT  ≥3 times 
baseline on two or more consecutive blood tests 
 Elevat ion of  TBL to ≥[ADDRESS_162898] , if baseline TBL is <1.[ADDRESS_162899] (except for  cases 
of known Gilbert’s syndrome)  
o In participants with baseline TBL ≥1.[ADDRESS_162900], the threshold should be 
TBL  ≥2 times baseline  
 Elevation of serum ALP to ≥[ADDRESS_162901] on two or more consecutive blood tests , if 
baseline ALP <1.[ADDRESS_162902]  
o In participants with baseline ALP ≥1.[ADDRESS_162903], the threshold is ALP  ≥2 times 
baseline on two or more consecutive blood tests  
 Hepatic event considered to be a n SAE , and  
 Discontinuation of study drug due to a hepatic event . 
Note  that the interval  between the  two consecutive blood tests should be at least 2 days.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hepatitis B Testing and Monitoring   
HBV DNA results that are reported as positive or as detecting HBV  DNA, but HBV DNA is 
below the level of quantification: the sponsor’s designated medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_143232]. HBV DNA testing is to be repeated as soon as is 
feasible. If HBV DNA is confirmed as positive, the participant must be permanently 
discontinued from study drug.  
The participant is to be referred to, evaluated, and managed by a specialist physician with 
expertise in evaluation  and management of viral hepatitis prior to discontinuation of any 
immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive therapy, including study drug. Timing of 
discontinuation from study drug relative to the initiation of any antiviral treatment for hepatitis is 
to be based on the recommendation of the consulting specialist physician, in conjunction with the 
investigator, and aligned with medical guidelines and standard of care.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hepatitis C Testing and Monitoring   
If HCV  RNA is detected during the study, the study drug will be per manently discontinued and 
the participant should receive appropriate follow -up medical care.  
8.2.8.  Infections and Opportunistic Infections   
Completion of the Infection eCRF is required  for each infection (with the exception of the 
common cold) reported as an AE or SAE. The sponsor will identify infections considered to be 
opportunistic based on the article by [CONTACT_81274]. (2015 ).

product complaints  information should be reported as soon as possible upon site awareness  using 
the originally completed Product Complaint Form with all changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_1275].  
8.3. PK and ADA Sampling   
Serum PK and ADA samples wil l be collected in all patients. Positive ADA results may be 
further evaluated for neutralizing antibodies. The procedural instructions will be provided in a 
separate PK and Serum Antibody Sampling manual.  
8.4. Study Termination   
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time. Should the study be terminated, the 
decision and reason will be communicated in writing by [CONTACT_143236]. Patients should be scheduled for an Early Termination 
visit. The entire study will be stopped if:  
 Evidence has emerged that, in the collective opi[INVESTIGATOR_143194], or the sole o pi[INVESTIGATOR_72008], continuation of the 
study is unnecessary or unethical  
 The stated objectives of the study are achieved  
 The Sponsor discontinues the development of the study drug  
Approved on [ADDRESS_162905] be recorded in the 
patient’s records and the eCRF.  
8.4.1.  Early Termination of Study Patients   
The Investigator will make reasonable effort s to keep each patient in the study. However, 
patients may terminate or be terminated early from the study for the following reasons:  
 Voluntarily withdrawal of consent to participate in the study participation, at any time . 
 Not achieving an EASI -50, from pa rent study baseline , by [CONTACT_10585] 16 , maintaining an 
EASI -50 response , or not achiev ing clinical benefit based on PI [INVESTIGATOR_143195].  
 Adverse event, laboratory abnormality or inter -current illness which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], indicates that continued treatment and/or participation in the study is not in 
the best interest of the patient . 
 Enrollment in any other clinical study involving an investigational product or enrollment 
in any other type of medical research judg ed not to be scientifically or medically 
compatible with this study . 
 Patients requiring long -term systemic treatment for symptoms of AD (e.g., non -
responders) . 
 Serious protocol violation, persistent non -compliance or requirement for medication or 
procedure  prohibited by [CONTACT_760] . 
 Lost to follow -up  
o Two attempts of contact (e.g., telephone contact) followed by a certified letter of 
contact [CONTACT_143237] a patient’s study records for all 
patients who are believed to be lost to follo w-up. 
Patients who are terminated early from the study will have an Early Termination visit  
(Section  7.7) scheduled as soon as possible. All information, including the reason for early 
termination will be recorded in the patient’s study records and in the eCRF.  
8.4.2.  Discontinuation of Inadvertently Enrolled Patients   
If the sponsor or investigator identify a participant who did not meet enrollment criteria and was  
inadvertently enrolled, then the participant should be discontinued from the study unless there  
are extenuating circumstances that make it medically necessary for the participant to continue on  
study drug. If the investigator and the sponsor -designated medical monitor agree it is medically  
appropriate to continue, the investigator must obtain documented approval from the sponsor 
designated  medical monitor to allow the inadvertently enrolled participant to continue in the  
study.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Temporary Study Drug Discontinuation   
Some possible reasons for temporarily withholding the study drug include, but are not limited to:  
 HBV  DNA results that are reported as positive, or as detecting HBV DNA, but HBV 
DNA is below  the level of quantification: the sponsor’s designated medical monitor 
should be contact[CONTACT_143238]. HBV  DNA testing is to be 
repeated as soon as is feasible. If HBV DNA is confirmed as positive, the participant 
must be permanently discontinued from study drug.  
 Hepatic event or liver test abnormality: the study drug should be withheld and additional 
testing performed  following consultation with the Lilly -designated medical monitor, if 
the results of repeat tests following  elevated ALT, ALP , or TBL include one of the 
following:  
o ALT [ADDRESS_162906] and TBL <[ADDRESS_162907]  
o ALP [ADDRESS_162908] and TBL <[ADDRESS_162909]  
o TBL [ADDRESS_162910]  or ALP.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Permanent Study Drug Discontinuation   
If HCV RNA is detected during the study, the study drug will be permanently discontinued, and 
the participant should receive appropriate follow -up medical care.  
Study drug must be discontinued f or patients who experience the following:  
 Inter -current illness that would, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant degree  
 Treatment -related AEs that are clinically significant, deemed persistent, in the judgment 
of the Investigator  
 Unacceptable toxicity  
 Pregnancy  
 The participant develops any of the following conditions during the study:

8.5. Data Safety Monitoring Board   
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) comprised of members who are 
independent of the study sponsor and study investigators will monitor patient safety by 
[CONTACT_143239];  if 
requested, the DSMB may have access to the treatment allocation code or any other requested 
data for the purposes of a risk -benefit assessment.  
The DSMB will provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the 
clinical study to ensure the protection and safety of the patients enrolled in the study. The DSMB 
will also institute any measures that may be required for ensuring the integrity of the study 
results during the study execution.

Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 58 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
9.1. General Statistical Methodology   
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. This study is a 
blinded study until the parent  studies have had database lock and dosing for those studies is no 
longer blinded.  An unblinded interim will be performed to support regulatory submissions when 
the parent  studies have completed the treatment periods.  Additional interim analyses may also be 
performed for regulatory interactions, safety updates, and disclosures.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an o verview of the efficacy and safety results. For  
categorical parameters, the number and percentage of patients in each category will be  presented. 
For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include n (number of patients ), mean, 
standard deviatio n, median, minimum and maximum.  
The Pruritus -NRS weekly mean will be calculated as follows: The mean of each patient’s 
baseline and post -baseline Pruritus -NRS scores will be computed for each week based on the 
previous [ADDRESS_162920] signed informed consent. This population will be used 
for tables and/or listings of disposition that include screen failures and inclusion  or exclusion 
criteria.  
The ITT population con sists of a ll patients assigned to treatment, even if the patient does not take 
the assigned treatment, does not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise does not follow the 
protocol. The modified ITT (mITT) population is the ITT population excluding all patients from 
sites with  critical GCP noncompliance findings  related to participant eligibility . mITT population 
will be used to summarize patient disposition, demographics, and efficacy analyses, plus to list 
patient data.  
Approved on [ADDRESS_162921] one confirmed dose of lebrikizumab will be included in the 
Safety Population . The modified Safety (mSafety) population  is the Safety population  excluding 
all patients from sites with critical GCP noncompliance findings  related to partici pant eli gibility . 
Demographics, extent of exposure, treatment compliance, prior  or concomitant medication use, 
adverse event, and immunogenicity safety analyses will be performed using the mSafety 
Population. A sub -group analys is of safety in patients under  18 years of age  (adolescents)  will be 
conducted as  appropriate.  
The number of patients included in the mSafety population will be summarized.  
9.1.2.  Baseline Definition   
The baseline used for efficacy and immunogenicity endpoints is the parent study baseline .  
9.2. EFFICACY  ASSESSMENTS   
The following efficacy assessments will be  summarized at each visi t, compared to parent study 
baseline : 
 Proportion of patients with Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score = 0 or 1 at each 
visit 
 Proportion of patients with Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) -75 (≥75% reduction 
in EASI scores) at each visit  
 Change and percent change in EASI score at each visit  
 Proportion of patients with EASI -50 and EASI -90 scores at each visit   
 Percentage of patients who achieve a ≥4 -point reduction in the Pruritus NRS score  at 
prespecified time points  (for studies in which these data were collected)  
 Percentage change in Pruritus NRS score at prespecified time points (for studies in which 
these data were collected)   
 Percentage change  in Skin Pain NRS score at prespecified time points (for studies in 
which these data were collected)  
 Change in sleep -loss at prespecified time points (for studies in which these data were 
collected)  
 Change in POEM scores at prespecified time points through the end of study  (for studies 
in which these data were collected)  
 Change in BSA at pres pecified time points through the end of study  
 Proportion of patients requiring AD concomitant treatment  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 60 9.3. Exposure and Compliance   
Exposure to lebrikizumab from the patient’s parent  study and from study KGAA will be 
combined for reporting the extent of exposure. The extent of exposure to study drug in each 
treatment group will be summarized by [CONTACT_143240], total number of 
injections, number of missed injections, and study drug total dose.  
The number and percentage of patients who are compliant  will be summarized . The treatment 
compliance calculation is defined as the  percentage of the  total number of injections  
administered  out of the expected  number of injections . A patient will be considered compliant 
with the dosing regimen if the patient received ≥75% of the expected number of injections while 
enrolled in the study.  
9.4. Adverse Events   
The primary endpoint of study DRM06 -AD07 is the proportion of patients discontinued from 
study treatment due to adverse events through the last treatment visit. This proportion will be 
calculated on the Safety Population from  Day 1  to Week 100. For interim an alysis, the 
calculation will be based on all data before interim DBL.  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and coded using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) dictionary.  
SAEs and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation o f study drug will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_143241]. All SAEs as well as AEs that led 
to permanent discontinuation of study drug  will be listed by [CONTACT_4676].  
The data from all studies will be poo led by [CONTACT_3148], 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W,  250 mg 
lebrikizumab Q4W, and 250 mg lebrikizumab overall.  
The AE data from this study will also be used as part of integrated safety assessments and  
ongoing safety review through study end.  
9.5. Other Safety Data   
The vital sign s and laboratory data from this study will be used as part of integrated safety 
assessments and ongoing safety review through study end.   
Medical histories will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary and presented in a by -patient 
listing. Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization  Drug 
dictionary. Concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148], drug clas s, and preferred 
term. Physical examination data will be presented in a by -patient listing.  
9.6. Sample -Size Determination   
Sample size  is based on the number of patients who completed  studies DRM06 -AD04, 
DRM06 -AD05, DRM06 -AD06, DRM06 -AD17, and DRM06 -AD18 who choose to participate in 
the study who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria.  It is estimated that approximately 900 
patients may enroll from the parent studies.

10.4. Study Documentation and the eCRF   
This protocol is to be signed by [CONTACT_143246]. A copy of the signed protocol signature [CONTACT_143256]’s Regulatory Binder.  
The Investig ator is responsible for ensuring that all study data is accurately recorded on the 
eCRFs or other study data collection tools. All eCRF entries must be supported by [CONTACT_102]’s 
medical records or source notes. The Investigator must ensure that study  observations and 
findings are legible and recorded accurately and completely.  
Original reports, traces and films must be reviewed, signed and dated, and retained by [CONTACT_143247].  
The Investigator is expected to promptly review all stu dy data recorded in the patient’s source 
records. Completed eCRFs must be promptly reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_97728]-Investigator at the end of the study. Corrections to data entered into the eCRF will be 
handled through an electronic query. Corrections to patients’ medical or source records should be 
legible, initialed and dated. At the end of the study, an electronic copy of the investigator’s 
eCRFs will be provided to the Investigator. The Investigator is to retain this data. The 
Investigator will maintain a signature [CONTACT_109440]/or corrections on eCRFs. Refer to Section  10.[ADDRESS_162923] and visit the Investigators at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to 
the protocol, and assess the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data by [CONTACT_143248]’ medical records with entries in the eCRF.  
The study monitor must be allowed access to laboratory test reports and other patient records 
needed to verify th e entries on the eCRF, provided patient confidentiality is maintained in 
accordance with local requirements. These records, and other relevant data, may also be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_143249], who is 
appointed to audit the study. Patient confidentiality will be maintained at all times.  
By [CONTACT_4912], the Investigators agree to co -operate with the 
study monitor to ensure that any problems detected during the monitoring visits are promptly 
resolved.

Investigator must contact [CONTACT_143250].  
If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another Investigator, IRB). Notice of such 
transfer will be given in writing to the Sponsor o r designee.  
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement for any or all the documents at the 
investigational site, arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor to 
store these in a secure archive facility outside the  site so they can be returned to the Investigator 
in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the 
patient, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_69786].

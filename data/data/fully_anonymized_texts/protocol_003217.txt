Significance:  
Severe injury, which occurs in approximately one quarter of the 2 million annual 
trauma patients in the [LOCATION_002], [1] is a known risk factor for acute kidney injury, 
which is independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. [2] Prevent ion 
of post-traumatic  AKI has been  identified  by [CONTACT_245774] (KDIGO) group as a top research priority.  [3] 
 
Background and Preliminary Observations:  
AKI complicating severe trauma is associated with increased morbidity and 
mortality. Trauma patients are subjected to multiple, additional renal insults early after 
trauma  such  as  tissue  injury  resulting  in  
rhabdomyolysis, systemic inflammatory 
respo nse, and exposure to nephrotoxins 
such as intravenous contrast agents 
(Figure) . Renal inflammation and 
subsequent AKI can be worsened and 
prolonged by [CONTACT_245775]/or from excess fluid 
administration leading to renal ed ema. [4,  5] 
Therefore, prevention and recovery from 
AKI requires optimization of fluid 
management  and early  identification  of high- 
risk patients.  
In 2018, 46% of severely injured 
trauma patients developed AKI within    one  
week of admission to the Trau ma Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at our institution. AKI was 
defined according to the KDIGO guidelines (Table 1) . [3] AKI -free days is a novel metric 
of time without  AKI during  the first week  of admission.  In 2018,  AKI-free days  of less than 
6 was observed  in 39% of ICU patients.  A diagnosis  of AKI and fewer  AKI-free days were 
associated    with    increased    risk     of 
mortality, prolonged ICU length -of-stay, 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77076] -of-stay, and 
discharge location other than home. 
Positive fluid balance w as also common 
among this population with 49% of 
patients having a fluid balance greater 
than 2L after 48 -hours. A positive fluid 
balance is an independent risk factor for 
AKI development  and mortality.  [6, 7] This 
is  despi[INVESTIGATOR_245766],   or

Goal -directed therapy (GDT) -based fluid resuscitation is hemodynamic 
resuscitation targeting the achievement of pre -determined end -points, which include: (1) 
correction of coagulopathy guided by [CONTACT_245776] (rTEG), (2) expedient 
hemorrhage  control,  and (3) restoration  of end-organ  perfusion  with balanced  transfusion 
guided by [CONTACT_245777], lactic acid, and base excess. GDT has been 
studied  in the peri-operative  setting  as part of enhanced  recovery  pathways  and has been 
reported to decrease the incidence of AKI. [8] Given that laboratory values are only 
obtained every few hours and hemodynamic abnormalities can persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_245767], the optimal strategy for ensuring optimal fluid administration 
during GDT remains  unknown.  
Dynamic  evaluation  of volume  status  complements  traditional  measurements  used 
in GDT to improve resuscitation once a patient arrives to the ICU. A number of dynamic 
and static tests have been evaluated in assessment of fluid responsiveness, all with 
various limitations ( Table  2).

Ultrasound assessment of volume status is appealing because it is non -invasive, 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_245769],  inexpensive,  and easily  learned.  Guidelines  from the Society  of Critical 
Care Medicine endorses assessment of preload responsiveness by [CONTACT_245778] (IVC) collapsibility by [CONTACT_2207] (Grade 1B). [16] Kanji, et al. found a lower 
incidence of AKI after incorporating volume assessment by [CONTACT_245779] -performed limited 
bedside echocardiography for patients with shock of mixed etiologies. [1 7] Notably, 
volume assessment in their study frequently resulted in decreased fluid   administration.  
IRB NUMBER : HSC -M4S-19-0425 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/03/2019  GUIDE Trial Study Protocol   However, the effectiveness of routine ultrasound assessments for GDT in reducing AKI 
incidence and duration in trauma patients in a teaching institution is unknown.  
 
Rationale for Clinical Trial:  
Ultrasound assessment of volume status and fluid responsiveness is a technique 
frequent ly utilized in the trauma ICU at our institution and is performed by [CONTACT_245780]. Residents are taught this technique during their clinical rotation on service, 
as well as during other intensive care rotations. Physicians utilize the information 
gathered from the IVC ultrasound for resuscitation feedback. However, obtaining 
repeated IVC measurements for feedback is uncommon and many physicians obtain 
resuscitation feedback from additional adjuncts, as listed in the table above. These 
practices are in consistently documented in the medical record, making it difficult to 
retrospectively ascertain if and how these practices impact clinical outcomes. 
Furthermore, implementation of a protocol without proof of effectiveness would risk 
inappropriate energy ex penditure by [CONTACT_61745]. And finally, there may be risks of 
increased physician feedback.  
 
Design:  
 
Hypothesis : Ultrasound -guided GDT results in adult trauma patients with more AKI -free 
days when compared to usual care in the trauma ICU at a teaching ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
Design : This is a single -center, pragmatic, cluster randomized crossover trial to be 
performed  at The Red Duke  Trauma  Institute,  [LOCATION_007]  Medical  Center,  an academic,  level- 
1 trauma  center.  
 
Study  Participants : Primary  participants  are the care providers  in the Shock  Trauma  ICU. 
All providers will be included in this study. The care structure is comprised of post - 
graduate year [ADDRESS_298806]  16 years  of age that are admitted  to the Shock  Trauma 
ICU will be assessed for eligibility. Exclusion criteria of secondary participants include 
prisoners and pregnancy. Prison ers will be excluded due to their vulnerable status. 
Because  pregnancy  results  in an increase  in circulating  blood  volume  up to 50%,  there  is 
a high likelihood of clinical misinterpretation of ultrasound findings. [18] Therefore, 
pregnant patients will be excluded as well. Both of these exclusions are expected to 
minimally impact secondary participant  enrollment.  
 
Randomization : Care teams will be clustered according to resident and fellow rotation 
schedule.  Rotations occur on the first of the month with a new care team and  therefore

using variable permuted blocks using a computer -generated random sequence.  Clusters 
will be randomized by a study coordinator using sequentially numbered, opaque sealed 
envelope. Care assignment will continue until the 15th of each month, at which poi nt the 
cluster      will      cross      over      and      provide      the      alternative        assignment.  
 
 
Procedures : 
During  the assigned  intervention  period,  a care team  member  will perform  IVC ultrasound 
to assess  volume  status  and fluid responsiveness  upon  patient  arrival  to the ICU, and two 
more times over a [ADDRESS_298808] three hours 
apart. IVC diameter and collapsibility index (IVCCI) will be measured. Use of the results 
to guide care will be at the discretion of the primary team. Usual goals of resuscitation 
include lactate concentration <1 mmol/L, base excess +2 to -2, normal rTEG valu es, 
mean  arterial  pressure  >[ADDRESS_298809]  consistent  with <18%  IVCCI 
and IVC diameter 15 - 25 mm. [19] Measurements are to be interpreted by [CONTACT_245781].  Results  of the ultrasound  and subsequent  management  will be 
recorded in a study notebook by [CONTACT_245782].  
 
Usual Care: No changes to usual care will be made. Physicians will record results of  
IVC ultrasound, if  utilized.  
 
Quality Assurance : Accuracy of technique of all care team physicians will be assessed 
during  an ultrasound  training  session  provided  the day  prior to the intervention  arm of the 
cluster. Additional training will be provided until proficiency deemed adequate by [CONTACT_245783]. Session leaders will include the Trauma ICU faculty and the study PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_245770], 
which includes IVC Ultrasound techniques (GH). The dedicated training session will be 
new to the rotating  resident  education,  but represents  a similar  training  to prior,  individual 
training sessions that occur betwee n a resident and faculty throughout an ICU  rotation.  Care  Team  1 Care  Team 2 Care  Team 3 Care  Team 4 Care  Team 5 Care Team  6

STICU  at all times  and US for the same  patient  may be performed  by [CONTACT_245784], 
based on individual  care demands within the unit.  If the physician is having difficulty with 
US technique, another physician is available to attempt the ultrasound prior to indicating 
that the ultrasound was unable to be  performed.  
 
Outcomes : 
Primary  outcome:  AKI-free days  within  7 days  of injury.  AKI will be defined  by [CONTACT_245785].  All stages will be considered  AKI. 
 
Secondary outcomes: AKI incidence within the first 7 days of ICU admission, stage of 
AKI, need for renal replacement therapy, quantity and type of flui ds administered at 24 
and 48 hours, quantity and type of diuretics admisnistered at 24 and 48 hours, time to 
lactate normalization, time to creatinine concentration <1.5 mg/dL or to prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_245771], time to base excess normalization, ventilator -free d ays, ICU -free days within 
first 30 days. Adverse events determined a priori include transfusion -related acute lung 
injury, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], abdominal compartment syndrome, new 
onset congestive heart failure, and re -bleeding requiring un scheduled intervention. Data 
measurement will occur according to the schedule outlined in Table 3 .

IRB NUMBER : HSC -M7S-19-0425 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/03/2019  GUIDE Trial Study Protocol   Statistical Analysis : 
The largest feasible study will be completed over the course of 12 months with an 
estimated enrollment of 30 secondary subjects per cluster, resulting in 360 patients 
enrolled in each treatment group and 720 total patients in the study.  
 
No interim analysi s will be completed. Multilevel Bayesian analysis will be performed to 
assess the effectiveness of the intervention to account for care team cluster. Neutral, 
conservative priors will be used to estimate the probability of both benefits and harms.  
 
Safety Assessment:  
Ultrasound imaging uses high -frequency sound waves to create images from wave 
reflection from internal body structures. It has been utilized routinely for over [ADDRESS_298810], and is considered safe when utilized by a healthcare 
provider. [20]  
 
Data Collection and Confidentiality:  
Clinical data and laboratory data will be prospectively collected as part of an ongoing, 
prospective trauma registry. Findings from both scheduled and unscheduled volume 
assessments  by [CONTACT_245786] a study  notebook  kept in a locked  cabinet 
at the charge nurse’s station and transferred to a secure, Microsoft Access database 
daily. The database will be accessible only to study personnel, as approved by [CONTACT_245787].  
 
Future directions : 
The results of this study will inform the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing 
scheduled ultrasound -guided fluid resuscitation for AKI prevention.  
 
Ethical Considerations : 
 
The protocol proposed aims to increase phys ician feedback of resuscitation by [CONTACT_101485] a non -invasive ultrasounds and improve healthcare delivery. This study poses 
minimal risk to subjects and will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of patients  or 
physicians. The investigators seek approva l through the institutional review board for 
waiver of individual consent and qualify as a quality improvement  initiative.

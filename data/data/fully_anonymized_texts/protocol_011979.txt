2. BACKGROUND
2.1. Porta-Catheter placement
A Porta-Catheter (Port-a-Cath) is a vascular a ccess device placed completely under the skin 
on either side of the chest. The device is rout inely placed to deliver chemotherapy treatments, 
obtain blood draws or infuse fluids intraven ously. Port-a-Cath placement may be performed 
under general anesthesia or sedation (Monitored Anesthesia Care, MAC) depending on patient 
health factors and preference. Intraoperativ e anxiety is a common problem when MAC instead 
of general anesthesia is used during minor surg ical procedures such as Port-a-Cath placement. 
Johansson et al. reported that 60% of the patients felt “unpleasant” during Port-a-Cath 
insertion under local anesthesia. I ntraoperative anxiety is associated with a negative influence 
on pain perception, increased use of sedati ves like benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (i.e., midazolam) and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], prolonged recovery a fter surgery and unnecessary post procedural hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_70998] e calming effects via binding to GABA Areceptors.
Fatigue, confusion, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and re stlessness are undesira ble adverse effects of 
midazolam and opi[INVESTIGATOR_70999] ’ability to actively participate in their intra- and 
postoperative care. Furthermore, Chang et al. fo und that the use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_71000]’s satisfaction during Port -a-Cath placement. Non-benz odiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_71001]. Intraoperative 
sedation with i.v. dexmedetomidine has de monstrated significant reduction in the 
postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_71002], as reported by [CONTACT_71035]. However, dexmedetomidine can cause 
hypotension and bradycardia and prolonged sedation. As a result of the potential adverse of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_71003], and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], non- pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_71004].
Music, a non-pharmacological intervention, ha s been studied to redu ce anxiety in minor 
surgery. While Schaal et al. indicated that perioperative music did not reduce anxiety or 
cortisol levels during Port-a-Cath placement,  McDaniel et al. reported that music via 
headphones (though not via loud speakers) resulted in signific antly lower anxiety after the 
procedure compared to the beginning. However, a major deficiency in McDaniel’s study was 
the lack of randomization to the studied interventions and that musical therapy can interfere Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
3URWRFRO
9HUVLRQ'DWH
3DJHRI
with the patients’ ability to follow commands . Therefore, it is important to examine other non-
pharmacological intraoperative interventions which may be able to reduce anxiety and the use 
of excessive doses of midazolam and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], as well as improve recovery after Port-a-Cath 
placement.
2.[ADDRESS_77344] and an inhibitor of  serotoninergic targets. Yuan et al. proposed 
that both molecules also exert anti-inflammatory effects by [CONTACT_71036]-kB and 
the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-a, IL-1B and PGE2). The sedative effects 
of lavender aromatherapy have been studied in multiple clinical studies. A meta-analysis by 
[CONTACT_71037]. showed a lack of conc lusive evidence to indicate aromatherapy for the treatment of 
preoperative anxiety. However, more recent  studies have shown promising results. For 
instance, Wotman et al. demonstrated a reduct ion in preoperative anxiety in ambulatory 
surgery patients treated with aromatherapy unde rgoing procedures in general otolaryngology. 
A major limitation of the stud y was the lack of a placebo-co ntrolled arm. Comparable results
were reported by [CONTACT_71038]. in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_71005] ğluet al. in a randomized controlled trial. Ki m et al. in a study of acupuncture needle Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center

3DJHRI
insertion found that subjects who inhaled a lave nder oil for 5 minutes demonstrated a decrease 
in anxiety, less needle insertion pain, and Bi spectral Index (processed EEG) changes suggestive 
of sedation.
Peppermint oil has long been valued for its anti nausea effect. Grigoleit et al. found that 
menthol and menthone, the main constituents o f peppermint oil, appear to act as smooth 
muscle relaxants through calcium channel bl ockade when the oil is orally ingested. As an
inhaled vapor, peppermint oil likely acts through another mechanism, such as by [CONTACT_71039]. Hines et al., in a 
systematic review, found that aromatherapy appeared to be no better than placebo in 
preventing nausea, although there was some evidence that patients who had received 
aromatherapy required fewer an tiemetic medications. Hines et  al. rated the quality of the 
included studies as moderate to very low by [CONTACT_71040] (Grading of Recommendations, 
Assessment, Development and Evaluations) criter ia, however. More recently, Ahmadi et al.
found peppermint oil aromatherapy to be effective in reducing nausea after abdominal surgery. 
Maghami et al. found that peppermint oil aromathe rapy was effective in reducing nausea after 
open-heart surgery, although the peppermint oil was delivered via in-line nebulizer in patients 
who remained intubated, limiting  the study’s generalizability. 
Because the existing literature is equivocal for both lavender and peppermint 
aromatherapy, we believe that a well-designed placebo-controlled trial may help to resolve 
some of the uncertainty as to their clinical effectiveness in the ambulatory perioperative 
setting. As well, to our knowledge there have b een no studies of arom atherapy conducted on 
subjects undergoing surgery performed under Monitored Anesthesia Care (versus general 
anesthesia).
Our primary hypothesis is that preoperative and intraoperative placement of an active 
lavender-peppermint patch (vs. placebo patch) will re sult in a shorter time to discharge-
readiness in the post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU). Secondary hypotheses are that subjects 
randomized to active aromatherapy patch will  have lower midazolam use intraoperatively 
(mg), lower intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (m orphine equivalents), lower supplemental 
intraoperative antiemetic use, longer time to first occurrence of PONV, lower rate and intensity 
of post-operative nausea or vomiting in PACU, lower rate of rescue an tiemetic use in PACU, 
lower maximum pain intensity in PACU (0-10 numerical rating scale), and higher patient 
satisfaction in PACU (Likert scale).

3. Background Device Information
Aromatabs® are inhalational aromatherapy patches intended to self- adhere to a patient’s 
gown or clothing and release pleasant odor s over several hours (up to 8 hours, per 
manufacturer). The essential oils themselves do not conta ct with the patient’s skin, since the 
patch is contained in a pl astic envelope, and it is this plasti c envelope that is affixed to the 
patient’s gown or clothing. https://beekley.com/product-detai ls/elequil-aromatabs-lavender-
peppermint-373
The Aromatabs® patches will be  stored in a secured cabinet in the study team office, 
following storage guidelines from the manufacturer. Each patch will be labeled in accordance
with FDA regulations and institutional policies be fore use. Detailed records of receipt, use or 
disposition will be maintained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_71006].
This is study is not intended to  promote nor market Aromatabs®.

assigned Aromatab® will be activated in the pr eoperative holding area by [CONTACT_71042] a folded towel placed as ide the subject’s head, contralateral 
to the side of the planned surgery. The to wel and Aromatab® will be transferred to the 
operating table with the subject as they arrive in the operative suite and maintained beside the 
subject’s head throughout the surgery.
All subjects will have standard physiologic moni tors placed on arrival to the operating room 
as per American Society of Anesthesiologists stan dards. They will have a nasal oxygen cannula 
or face mask placed to maintain adequate oxyg enation. An anesthesia provider (Certified 
Registered Nurse Anesthetist and/or Physician Anesthesiologist) will be present with them 
continuously from the time they leave the preope rative holding area until the time that they 
reach the PACU, and a handoff is given to the rece iving PACU nurse. Patients will be eligible to 
receive a maximum dose of [ADDRESS_77348] before 
transporting to the operative suite (standard of care, depending on patient’s age , physiologic 
condition, and preference). The anesthesia provid er will administer intraoperative doses of 
midazolam i.v. and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] i.v. as needed, titrat ing to the desired level of sedation. The towel 
and Aromatab® will be discarded when the subj ect leaves the operating room. Prophylactic 
antiemetics will be administered  per anesthesiologist clinic al judgment, as Port-a-Cath 
placement is not known to carry a high risk of  postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and 
general anesthesia is not being administered. Further, midazolam itself is known to have an 
antiemetic effect, as reported by [CONTACT_71043]. If  subjects report experience nausea or vomiting 
during the procedure, rescue em etics will be administered as necessary and per standard of 
care.
Postoperatively, all subjects  will be taken to the PACU an d cared for by a PACU nurse in 
standard fashion until they are discharged. Un der the current standard of care, the surgeon 
injects local anesthetic around the surgical wo und, thus very few current outpatient Port-a-
Cath patients require postoperat ive opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. If subjects have breakthrough pain, postoperative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_71009]. If the 
subjects experience postoperative nausea or  vomiting in PACU, re scue emetics will be 
administered as necessary and per standard of  care. In the PACU, a research coordinator, 
research fellow, collaborator, or other member  of the research team will assess patient ’s 
nausea/vomiting, pain intensity and satisfaction.Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center

9.3 Recording Adverse Events
All adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be monitored from the 
time of procedure through end of the study. Th PI [INVESTIGATOR_71013].
An AE is defined as any undesirable clinical occurrence in a patient whether or not it is 
considered to be device related. In addition, the  definition of AE applies to any event with an 
onset post study procedure or to any underlying diseases, present at base line, that exacerbate 
in severity post study procedure. Therefore, an underlying disease that was present at the time 
of enrollment is not reported as an AE, but an y increase in the severity of the underlying 
disease is to be reported as an AE. All repo rted AEs must be recorded in the database. A 
description of the event, including the start date, resolution date, action taken, and the 
outcome should be provided, al ong with the Investigator’s as sessment of the relationship 
between the AE, the study treatment and the st udy procedure. This protocol will use common Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center

9HUVLRQ'DWH
3DJH RI
terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 4.0. For the AEs not characterized in 
the CTACE, the following definitions for rating severity of AEs will be used:  
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, b ut easily tolerated; are of minor 
irritant type; causing no loss of time from normal activities; 
symptoms would not require medica tion or a medical evaluation; 
signs or symptoms are transient.
Moderate: Interferes with the patient’s us ual activity and/or requires 
symptomatic treatment.
Severe: Symptom(s) causing severe discom fort and significant impact of 
the patient’s usual activity and requires treatment.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defi ned as an event which leads to:  
x Death due to any cause
x Life-threatening condition
x Results in persistent or sign ificant disability/incapacity
x Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71014]
x Necessitates an interven tion to prevent a permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure
x Results in congenital abnormality
All SAE’s will be reported.
For purposes of this study, the following events are not considered adverse events, 
because they are normally expected  to occur in conjunction post-surgery, or are associated with 
customary, standard care of patients undergoing these procedures:
xEarly post-operative pain (within 48hours po st-index procedure) at the incision site 
and/or related to position on procedure table
xPost-anesthesia emesis, nausea, or headache  (within [ADDRESS_77354]-index procedure)
xChest pain without associated ECG changes

from PACU (minutes) after Port-a-Cath placem ent surgery between the patients who are 
randomized to receive intraoperative aromathe rapy (Aromatab® patch) versus placebo. We 
will enroll [ADDRESS_77358] 62 eligible and treated 
patients. Patients will be  randomized to receive either Aromatab® patch or placebo patch 
with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Th e primary objective of the study is to determine if patients
randomized to receive Aromatab® patch will ha ve a significantly shorter time to readiness Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center

for discharge from PACU (minutes) after surgery when compared to patients who receive a 
placebo patch. The primary endpoint, time to  readiness for discharge from PACU after 
surgery, is defined as the time interval in min utes, from the end of surgery to the time when 
a patient is evaluated as ready to be disc harged from PACU. We observed from previous 
data on the patients treated with standard of  care (same as placebo) that the mean PACU 
duration was 66.[ADDRESS_77359] 80% power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_77360] with a two-side d type I error rate of 0.05 (nQuery+nTerim 
4.0).
12.[ADDRESS_77361] deviations, medians, and ranges. Cate gorical demographic variables and clinical 
variables, such as gender, incidence, and inten sity of PONV, incidence of antiemetic use in 
PACU, will be summarized throug h frequencies and percentages. Fisher’s exact test or Chi -
square test will be used to evaluate the as sociation between two categorical variables of 
interest. Wilcoxon-rank sum test or t-test wi ll be used to compare continuous outcomes 
such as time to readiness for discharge from PACU (minutes) after surgery between 
treatment groups. Linear/logistic  regression model may be fitted to assess the effect of 
important covariates on the primary/secondary endpoints.
12.4 Data Collection and Management
All study data will either be collected on a paper case report form (CRF) (which will be
entered into a computer database) or will be extracted directly from the EMR to the 
REDCap database. Each subject will be assigned a random number code and the key linking
the code and the subject identifier will be stored on an MD Anderson password protected 
computer. All changes to the CRF will foll ow Good Clinical Pract ice guidelines. TheProprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center

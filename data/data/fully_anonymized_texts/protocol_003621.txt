SUMMARY  
This study is Investigator initiated research (IIR) supported by a grant and study 
medication from Shionogi . 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
Ospemifene is indicated for post -menopausal women diagnosed with vulvar 
vaginal atrophy  (VVA ) and dyspareunia.  While ospemifene clinically significantly 
reduces pain associated with dyspareunia, there has been little prospective 
documentation using vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the visible 
changes to the vulva , vestibule and vaginal region with daily administration of [ADDRESS_1059604]-menopausal women with VVA and dyspareunia.   This 
study will include a total of 6 prospective photographic sessions of the vulva, 
vestibule and vagina o ver the 20 weeks administration of 60 mg ospemifene in 
the study.  Comparisons will be made of  baseline photography (vulvoscopy 
session 0) with photography at 4 weeks (vulvoscopy session 1), 8 weeks 
(vulvoscopy session 2), 12 weeks (vulvoscopy session 3), 16 weeks (vulvoscopy 
session 4) and 20 weeks (vulvoscopy session 5).  
 
2. TRIAL OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective of this study is to prospectively document , using 
vulvoscopy with detailed photography, the visible changes to the vulva, vestibule 
and vaginal region  in post-menopausal women with dyspareunia taking 60 mg 
daily ospemifene  for twenty weeks at 6 timepoints:  baseline , 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 
12 weeks, 16 weeks and 20 weeks.  
 Secondary objectives include changes in pain as noted on the pain scale 
(appendix 2) and the q- tip test, in the vestibule on visual scale (appendix 3) by 
[CONTACT_771787] (appendix 4).  
 3. DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH DESIGN  
 3.1 Overall Study Plan  
This is an unblinded  study to be conducted at a single research center, San 
Diego Sexual Medicine.  Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria  will 
receive 60 mg ospemifene daily for twenty weeks. After the  informed consent is 
 
Protocol SDSM-2015-02. 4 
April 4 , 2016  
 signed , a baseline  physical examination , and vulvoscopy with detailed 
photography of the vulva, vestibule and vagina , will be performed .  Physical 
examination and vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the vulva, vestibule 
and vagina, will be repeated  prospectively every 4 weeks for a total of 20  weeks.   
Therefore, physical examination and vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the 
vulva, vestibule and vagina will be performed prospectively at baseline  
(vulvoscopy session 1) , 4 weeks (vulvoscopy session 2) , 8 weeks (vulvoscopy 
session 3) , 12, we eks (vulvoscopy session 4) , 16 weeks (vulvoscopy session 5)  
and 20 weeks  (vulvoscopy session 6)  following daily administration of [ADDRESS_1059605] (IRB) Approval

 6 Adverse Event Assessment  
 
6.1 Adverse Events  
 An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom, medical condition, or 
laboratory abnormality occurring after the Subject  has taken the first dose of 
study medication, whether the event is considered study medication -related or 
not.  Medical conditions or diseases present before starting study medication are 
only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study medication.  
The Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_771773] s who experience an adverse 
event until the Subject ’s medical condition returns to normal or until a clinically 
satisfactory resolution is obtained.  
 
Adverse events are classified in several wa ys: as either serious or non -serious, 
and either expected or unexpected.  Serious adverse events (SAEs) include those that result in death, are life threatening, require inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_771774], re sult in persistent or 
significant disability or incapacity, require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes described above, are congenital anomalies or birth 
defects, or are medically important events or reactions (see Section 7.2) .  Non -
serious adverse events are those adverse events that do not meet the above criteria for serious adverse events.  Expected adverse events are those events 
that have been previously observed and are described in the current prescribing 
information for  the study medication.  Unexpected adverse events are those 
events that are not listed in the prescribing information, or are not consistent with the specificity or severity described in the current prescribing information.  
 Any abnormality that, in the ju dgment of the Principal  Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a physician 
identified on Form FDA 1572, impacts the health, safety, or well -being of the 
study participant such that immediate follow -up (e.g., additional testing or 
treatment intervention) is warranted is considere d a clinically significant 
abnormality.  A determination of clinical significance is independent of whether or 
not the abnormality is considered causally related to the use of the study 
medication.  
 6.2 Serious Adverse Events  
 A SAE is defined by [CONTACT_1032] r egulation as any AE that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life threatening ( Subject  is at risk of death at the time the event 
occurs)  
3. Persistent/significant disability or incapacity (substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct no rmal life functions)  
4. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324].  
 
Protocol SDSM-2015-02. [ADDRESS_1059620] , discovered during 
general questioning by [CONTACT_771791], or detected through a physical 
examination or other means,  will be recorded in the clinic chart (source 
document) and on the Adverse Events CFR.  Each description of an adverse event will include:  
1. Duration: start and stop dates  
2. Expectedness  
3. Severity: events will be classified as either mild (causing no limitatio n 
in normal activities), moderate  (causing some limitation in normal 
activities), or severe  (causing significant limitation in or the inability to 
perform normal activities)  
4. Action taken  
5. Relationship to the study medication:  not related, possibly related,  or 
probably related  
6. Outcome: resolved, continuing requiring no treatment, continuing 
requiring treatment, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or death  
 Whenever possible, adverse events causing premature study discontinuation 
should be followed to resolution.  
 All SAEs occu rring during the study and up to [ADDRESS_1059621]  
completes the study (visit on Day 84 or earlier) must be reported to the Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_771775] [ADDRESS_1059622] provide 
any other AE notification required by [CONTACT_1201].  Each SAE is to be recorded on a SAE worksheet along with follow -up records.  Examples of follow -up records may 
include photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_247401], consult ation reports, autopsy findings, 
laboratory reports, and a summary of the outcome of the reaction.

 6.4 Risks 
 
The risks to Subjects in this study are those associated with in the pack age insert 
for ospemifene:  hot flashes, vaginal discharge, muscle spasms and increased 
sweating.  Less common but serious side effects include stroke, blood clots and 
cancer of the lining of the uterus.  
 
7. Study Medication and Accountability

9.5 Ethics  
 This study will be condu cted in accordance with current Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), with the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR Title 21, Parts 50, 54, 56, 312, and 314).  Current GCP is consistent with the ethical principles described in 
the current version of the Declaration of  Helsinki.

9.6  Case Report Forms, Data Handling, and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_771783]:  
• Relevant information determined at each Subject  visit is to be recorded on 
source documents/CRFs.   
• Data recorded on CRFs will be documented in an anonymous fashion with 
the Subject  identified only by [CONTACT_771792].  
• All CRFs are to be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate communication of data.  A black pen is preferred to ensure clarity of any reproduced copi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Any change or corrections made on the CRFs must 
be dated and initi aled by [CONTACT_201274].  In such cases, 
the best procedure is to cross out the original entry with a single line.  Do not erase, overwrite, or obliterate, by [CONTACT_61076], the original entry.  
• CRFs and any data queries should accurately reflect Subject  data records 
(source documents).

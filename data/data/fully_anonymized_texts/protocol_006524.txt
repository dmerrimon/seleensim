TitleOptimal Treatment for Women with a Persisting Pregnancy of 
Unknown Location (PPUL) - A Randomized Clinical Trial of Women 
at Risk for an Ectopic Pregnancy: Active Treatment versus No 
Treatment
The “ACTorNOT TRIAL”
Short Title ACTorNOT
Test Article Methotrexate
Phase N/A (comparative efficacy)
MethodologyThis is a randomized clinical trial for women identified to have a 
persisting pregnancy of unknown location (PPUL) (a nonviable 
gestation). Randomization will be into active versus expectant 
management. Additionally, women randomized to active management 
will be equally randomized between two active management strategies.
Randomization will be 1:2 between expectant management and active 
management, and 1:1 between active management A and active 
management B (thus randomization will be 1:1:1 into the three 
management arms).
The arms will be:
1)Expectant management
2)Active management A)
Determine the location of the pregnancy and only treat those with an 
EP: (Uterine evacuation followed by [CONTACT_372220] (50 mg/m2) given as 
an intramuscular injection) for those that have evidence of a non- 
visualized ectopic pregnancy)
3)Active management B)
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_372189] a PPUL without determination of 
the location of the gestation (Treatment with methotrexate).
After randomization to initial management plan, all patients will be 
followed by [CONTACT_372221]. The clinician 
will determine subsequent management based on clinical course, further 
evaluation of serial human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and 
symptoms.

7ObjectivesThe primary outcome measure in each of each 3 treatment arm is the 
uneventful clinical resolution of a PPUL without change from the initial 
management strategy.
Secondary outcome measures are: number of ruptured ectopic 
pregnancies, number and type of re-interventions (additional 
methotrexate injections or surgical procedures), treatment 
complications, adverse events, number of visits and time to resolution, 
patient satisfaction, and future fertility.
Number of Subjects 276 subjects with a PPUL
Diagnosis and Main 
Inclusion CriteriaInclusion criteria will include pregnant women who are 
hemodynamically stable, ≥ 18 years of age, diagnosed with a persisting 
pregnancy of unknown location (defined as: no definitive ultrasound 
evidence of intrauterine or extra uterine gestation and a plateau in at 
least two serial hCG values (defined as less than an 15% rise per day
or less than a 50% decline over 2-14 days,)
Statistical 
MethodologyThe percent success of initial management course will be compared for 
each study arm. The two hypotheses to be tested will be that 1) active 
management is superior to expectant management and 2) the two active 
management strategies are non-inferior to each other.
If active management is not superior to expectant management (or if the 
two active management strategies are non-inferior), the determination 
of which management strategy is optimal will be based on secondary 
outcomes. Secondary outcome measures and cost will be modeled in a 
cost effectiveness analysis using average cost and charge per 
procedure.

83 Introduction
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US and 
international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on 
Harmonization guidelines), [ADDRESS_465765] trimester of pregnancy is at risk for ectopic pregnancy (EP) and 
should be distinguished from a woman with an ongoing potential viable intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) and from 
a woman with a miscarriage. Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is defined as the implantation of an embryo outside the 
uterus. EP is a major cause of maternal morbidity and responsible for 6% of pregnancy-related deaths (1, 2). 
However if diagnosed and treated early and before rupture, morbidity is limited and conservative management 
is preferred (3). Early diagnosis permits early treatment and allows for procedures that preserve fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_372190] (4).
There is worldwide consensus regarding the utility of trans-vaginal ultrasound and serial quantitative serum 
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations in the diagnosis of women at risk for EP.  Diagnosis can 
be straightforward when ultrasound definitively identifies an IUP or EP (6). However, ultrasound can be 
inconclusive in up to 40% of women with a symptomatic first trimester pregnancy (7). This clinical quandary is 
termed a 'pregnancy of unknown location' (PUL).  A PUL is not a diagnosis but a transient state in the 
diagnostic process of a woman at risk for EP (8). The management of a woman with a PUL necessitates further 
surveillance and/or diagnostic tests to achieve a final diagnosis, including (but not limited to) serial hCG 
concentrations to determine if a pregnancy is growing or resolving (non-viable).  Ultimately, a woman is 
usually diagnosed with one of three outcomes: an ongoing growing IUP, a miscarriage, or an EP. If the 
pregnancy resolves without any intervention, the location is never known and is termed a resolved PUL (8).
During the course of evaluation of a woman with a PUL, up to one third of women will be found to have serial 
hCG values that neither rise nor decline. This is diagnostic of a nonviable gestation (either a miscarriage or an 
EP) and is termed - a persisting PUL (PPUL). The hCG is produced by [CONTACT_372222] (and is not visible on ultrasound). Surgical exploration in the form of uterine evacuation 
(dilation and curettage) is often performed to confirm the location of the persistent trophoblast tissue. If 
trophoblast tissue is found at the time of uterine evacuation, a miscarriage has been diagnosed (and treated). If 
the hCG concentration does not decline after uterine evacuation, the trophoblast is presumed to be in the 
fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_372191] (5). An ectopic gestation can then be treated medically 
with methotrexate, to hasten the resolution of the extra-uterine trophoblast tissue (9, 10).
Of note, methotrexate will act on the trophoblast tissue if it is in the uterus or in the tube. Some have advocated 
that it is unnecessary to identify the location of the gestation. Thus, some have advocated treating a woman 
with a PPUL with methotrexate without first determining the location of the gestation (11).
Finally, both early miscarriage and early ectopic pregnancy can be managed expectantly (12-18). A recent 
study in the Netherlands demonstrated no difference in primary treatment success rate of single-dose 
methotrexate versus expectant management, 31/41 (76%) and 19/32 (59%), respectively [relative risk (RR) 1.3 
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9–1.8]. The absolute difference in failure rate found between active and 
expectant management was 18%. Expectant management of an EP or a PPUL is uncommon in the United 
States (16).

2018, 2015
9Thus, there are currently three commonly used strategies to manage a woman with a PPUL with true equipoise
as to which is more effective and optimal: Expectant management would avoid the morbidity associated with a 
surgical intervention needed to determine location and/or the morbidity of methotrexate. However during the 
time of expectant management, women are at risk for rupture of an EP with its inherent morbidity and mortality 
or at risk for complication from retained products of conceptions from an incomplete miscarriage. Moreover, 
resolution of a PPUL can take up to [ADDRESS_465766] if active management is superior to expectant 
management with sufficient power to identify an absolute difference of only 18%. Thus, if expectant 
management has similar efficacy to active management it can become an evidence-based treatment option for 
this population of women.
If active management is superior to expectant management, or even if similar in efficacy, it will likely still be 
desired by [CONTACT_372223] a common treatment strategy. Thus, determination of which 
active management strategy is optimal is also an important clinical question. Active management can be 
divided into two strategies A) Determine the location of the pregnancy and only treat those with an EP: (Uterine 
evacuation followed by [CONTACT_372220] (MTX) for only those who have evidence of a non-visualized EP) and (B) 
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_372189] a PPUL without determination of the location of the gestation: (MTX 
administered to all women with a PPUL). MTX is currently a standard of care to medially manage an un- 
ruptured EP (9, 11), but is not a standard of care to treat a miscarriage because methotrexate has inherent 
morbidity.
We have demonstrated that up to 50% of women with a PPUL have an EP and 50% have a miscarriage (5). 
However, surgical intervention in the form of a uterine evacuation (dilation and curettage) to identify if there 
were products of conception (trophoblast tissue) in the uterus was necessary to make this distinction. Thus, 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_372192] a woman with a PPUL with MTX may result in overtreatment of 50% of women.
Conversely, the morbidity and cost of a uterine evacuation may outweigh the cost and morbidity of 
“overtreatment” with MTX. Lack of objective data to inform clinicians as to the optimal strategy is an 
identified and universally accepted knowledge gap and a research priority and is therefore the focus of this 
protocol (8).
Of note, all women with a PPUL, regardless of the initial strategy adopted by a clinician (or allocated to in this 
protocol), will be followed until clinical resolution of the gestation. In some cases resolution is complete and 
uneventful, even if the location of the pregnancy is never ascertained. Complete uneventful resolution of the 
PPUL is the primary outcome of this trial. In other cases the clinical course and symptoms dictate intervention 
and abandonment of the initial management strategy. Until the gestation is completely resolved (i.e. all 
trophoblast tissue has been resorbed, as evidenced by [CONTACT_372224]) a women may become 
clinically symptomatic from an EP or miscarriage. Based on the clinical course after initial intended 
management, some receive additional intervention and/or treatment. Intervention may be needed to diagnose 
and/or treat an EP that becomes symptomatic (rupturing or ruptured) or to treat a woman with a miscarriage that 
becomes symptomatic because of retained products of conception. Thus, women may require surgical or 
medical intervention to diagnose or treat an EP, or require surgical or medical intervention for an unresolved 
miscarriage. A clinically important example is that approximately 10-20% of women with an EP treated with 
MTX fail medical management and require surgical management (16, 19). Quantification of these 
interventions, including side effects, time to resolution and cost are the secondary outcomes of this study.
These outcomes will determine which management strategies are optimal if the efficacy is similar.
3.2Preclinical Data
This type of study is not applicable in animals.
Optimal Treatment for a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12, 
2018, 2015
103.3Clinical Data to Date
The medical management of ectopic pregnancy is the use of intramuscular MTX. This is a common medical 
procedure with widely published recommendation (9, 10). MTX treatment has been used as single dose or 
multi-dose (19). We have demonstrated the efficacy and safety with the use of a 2 dose regimen (20). This 
two-dose regimen was developed under IND [ZIP_CODE]. One dose of MTX was used in the recent trial in 
Amsterdam (6). We expect that two doses of MTX will be more effective than one dose and thus our success 
rate will be higher (20).
3.4Risk/Benefits
All three management strategies in this randomized clinical trial are used as part of clinical standard of care, and 
therefore, we believe that the patient is not exposed to any 'experimental' risks. This study is a comparison of 
the efficacy and safety of three currently available and commonly used strategies. Randomization to one of 
these strategies therefore poses minimal risk to a subject. There is risk associated with the clinical condition, 
including the possibility of rupture of an ectopic pregnancy. Each strategy has mildly different risks associated 
with the treatment plan.
Subjects randomized to 'Expectant Management' may be at a higher risk for rupture of an ectopic pregnancy or 
retained products of conception, but avoid the morbidity associated with surgical and medical intervention.
Subjects randomized to Active management A) ‘Uterine evacuation followed by [CONTACT_372225]’ will be 
exposed to the risks of surgical intervention of uterine evacuation (risk of bleeding, infection and uterine 
perforation), but may be spared the exposure, and morbidity associated with MTX (risk of nausea, abdominal 
pain, mouth sores).
Subjects randomized to Active management B) ‘Empi[INVESTIGATOR_372193]’ may avoid the risk of uterine evacuation 
but are exposed to the side effects of MTX (see 2. above).
All subjects will have the risk of all therapeutic options explained to them as is the current practice for the 
clinical evaluation and management of a PPUL. Of note, during this treatment course, all subjects are 
inherently at risk for rupture from their potential ectopic pregnancy.
Additional risks include loss of confidentiality. Loss of confidentiality is prevented through omitting all 
personal identifiers in the research database.
In summary, the risks of participation in the research are mild (above that of their clinical condition) and are 
balanced by [CONTACT_155383].

114 Study Objectives
The goal of this study is to:
1) Determine if active management of women with a PPUL is superior to expectant management.
2) Determine if two common active management strategies of a women with a PPUL are non-inferior to each 
other.
3) Determine which management strategies are optimal based on secondary outcomes of cost, number of 
procedures, side effect, and time to resolution.
4.1Primary Objective
The primary outcome measure is the frequency of clinical resolution for each management strategy for a PPUL. 
Clinical resolution is defined as an uneventful decline of serum hCG to an undetectable level (less than 5 
mIU/mL) by [CONTACT_372226]. This outcome is accepted and commonly used to assess efficacy 
of medical and expectant management of miscarriage and EP (16, 20, 21).
4.2Secondary Objective: Assessment of
Number of ruptured ectopic pregnancies in each group
Quantification of re-interventions needed to manage a woman with a PPUL
o Outcomes include:
number of interventions beyond that of intended initial strategy in each group
oadditional number of MTX injections
oadditional surgical procedures
uterine evacuation (or dilation and curettage)
laparoscopy
laparotomy
Treatment complications and adverse events
Number of procedures (lab tests, ultrasounds)
Number of visits
Time to resolution
Patients’ preferences
Acceptability
Future fertility

125 Study Design
5.1General Design
This is a multi-site randomized comparative efficacy trial of strategies to manage a woman with a PPUL.
Randomization will be 1:2 between expectant management and active management, and 1:1 between active 
management A and active management B. (Thus randomization will be 1:1:1 into the three management arms.)
The arms will be:
1)Expectant management
2)Active management A)
Determine the location of the pregnancy by a uterine evacuation, followed by a pathologic evaluation. If no 
evidence of a uterine pregnancy is determined (i.e. non-visualized ectopic pregnancy), begin methotrexate 
dosage (50 mg/m2 given as an intramuscular injection).
3)Active management B)
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_372189] a PPUL without determination of the location of the gestation (Treatment 
with methotrexate)
For specifics of how MTX will be administered, please see below.
All patients will be followed by [CONTACT_372227], further evaluation of serial hCGs, repeat ultrasound, and symptoms. It is anticipated that in 
most cases the failed pregnancy will resolve (or be treated) successfully. Some women will fail or elect to stop 
initial management strategy and will be offered surgical or medical management. For example, the failed initial 
medical management of an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage necessitates surgical intervention.
5.2Subject Selection and Withdrawal
5.2.1Inclusion Criteria
1.Female with a persisting pregnancy of unknown location:
a.A pregnancy of unknown location is defined as a pregnancy in a woman with a positive pregnancy test 
but no definitive signs of pregnancy in the uterus or adnexa on ultrasound imaging. A definitive sign 
of gestation includes ultrasound visualization of a gestational sac with a yolk sac (with or without an 
embryo) in the uterus or in the adnexa (8). Ultrasound must be performed within [ADDRESS_465767] 2 serial hCG values (over 2-14 days), showing < 15% 
rise/day*, or < 50% fall between the first and last value. (This abnormal pattern of serial hCG 
confirms that the gestation is nonviable.)
*Calculated by [CONTACT_4475] X/ baseline X 100 and then compare to table for the number of days between values as 
below:
2days 30% or less
3days 50% or less
4days 75% or less
5days 100% or less
6days 130% or less
Optimal Treatment for a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12, 
2018, 2015
137days 166% or less
These numbers are rounded (conservatively) to accommodate ease of determination eligibility
The actuals % rise for 15%/ per day is: 1 day 15%, 2 days 32.3%, 3 days 52.1%, 4 days 74.9%, 5 days
101.1%, 6 days 131.3%, 7 days 166%
A minimal rise for a viable intrauterine pregnancy is 23% per day or 53% for two days. (4)
2.Patient is hemodynamically stable
3.Greater than or [ADDRESS_465768] recent hCG > 5000 mIU/mL
3.Patient obtaining care in relation to a recently completed pregnancy (delivery, spontaneous or elective 
abortion)
4.Diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease
5.Subject unwilling or unable to comply with study procedures
6.Known hypersensitivity to MTX
7.Presence of clinical contraindications for treatment with MTX (ACOG guidelines, Appendix B)
8.Prior medical or surgical management of this gestation
9.Subject unwilling to accept a blood transfusion
10.Patient ≤ 6.0 weeks gestation with known conception date with slow but continuous rise in hCG values (even if 
these values meet the inclusion definition above).  
5.3Subject Recruitment and Screening
Subjects will be recruited for participation in this study from the clinical practices at the participating 
institutions. The subjects will be patients who are currently undergoing clinical care at these approved sites. 
The site staff will be responsible for identifying eligible patients who meet the inclusion criteria, and have none 
of the exclusion criteria. All subjects will be counseled and sign the informed consent form before undergoing 
any study procedures.
5.4Informed Consent
The informed consent form will adequately address the risks and the benefits for the study, and will be 
approved by [CONTACT_372228]. No study procedures will be conducted 
before the patient signs the informed consent form.
The informed consent regarding clinical procedures (surgical intervention, administration of MTX, or expectant 
management, including side effect of each and chance of rupture of an EP) will be given in the context of 
normal clinical care by [CONTACT_372229], following local clinical standards.
Optimal Treatment for a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12, 
2018, [ADDRESS_465769] a persisting pregnancy of unknown location by [CONTACT_372230] (or 
clinician), eligibility will be determined. In the event that a clinical patient of the investigator (or study staff) 
meets the eligibility criteria for study participation, the investigator (or study staff) is required to document a 
second opi[INVESTIGATOR_372194]. If eligible, the subject will be offered 
enrollment into the study. The subject will be randomized by a computerized randomization tool.
Once the subject is randomized to initial management strategy, her clinical care will be continued with her 
clinical team (or clinician). Standard of care is to follow the subject until complete resolution of the persisting 
pregnancy of unknown location (defined by [CONTACT_372231] a value of less than 5 
mIU/mL) or treatment of an ectopic pregnancy (if identified). Follow up includes serial outpatient monitoring 
of hCG values, monitoring patient signs and symptoms, as well as ultrasound as needed. Based on these 
findings the treating physician may judge that surgical or medical intervention is required to diagnose or treat an 
ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Subjects will be screened for eligibility for MTX only after it is determined 
that they will receive it (i.e. via randomization or clinical discretion). Those who are randomized to receive 
MTX, but then are not able to receive it due to safety laboratory values, will be managed per the judgment of 
her treating physician.
Randomization will be performed when the patient is identified to have a persisting pregnancy of unknown 
location by a central randomization office utilizing an internet-based program. Randomization will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_3725]. A 1:1:1 randomization scheme for Arms 1, 2 and 3, respectively, will be followed.
Below the three arms of the trial are described:
6.1.1Expectant management
In this management arm the allocated plan is to expectantly manage the persisting pregnancy of unknown 
location without surgical or medical intervention, but with close clinical surveillance using serum hCG 
monitoring.
Success
Success of this management arm will be complete resolution of hCG from the serum, without medical or 
surgical intervention.
Failure
I)Failure is defined as the need for surgical or medical intervention to treat a persistent or ruptured ectopic 
pregnancy.
II)The need to perform a uterine evacuation to complete a miscarriage or to treat heavy bleeding also will be 
considered failure of this management arm.
6.1.2Active management A: Uterine evacuation followed by [CONTACT_372232] a non-visualized EP
In this management arm, a uterine evacuation or dilation and curettage will be scheduled. At the clinician's 
discretion, this can be performed using local anesthesia, sedation or general anesthesia and can use a manual or 
electrical vacuum evacuation. The procedure should be performed within three days of randomization.
Optimal Treatment for a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12, 
2018, 2015
15A repeat serum hCG value will be obtained within 12–36 hours of completion of the procedure. Based on this 
value one of two courses will be followed:
a) If the value has decreased by [CONTACT_7809] (or equal to) 15%:
The uterine evacuation is considered compete and successful. No further treatment is indicated and the subject 
is followed as an outpatient until complete resolution of hCG from the serum.
b) If the value has decreased less than 15% (or increased):
The uterine evacuation is considered not to have removed the products of conception and the trophoblastic 
tissue is presumed to be ectopi[INVESTIGATOR_372195]. In this case the diagnosis of a non-visualized ectopic pregnancy 
has been confirmed (5, 8). Treatment of the non-visualized ectopic pregnancy will be with intramuscular MTX 
using the 2-dose protocol (18). The administration of the first MTX injection should be within [ADDRESS_465770] is followed as an outpatient until 
complete resolution of hCG from the serum.
If a woman is randomized to receive MTX but is ineligible after screening with safety laboratory abnormalities, 
she will not receive MTX, but will remain in the allocated treatment arm for statistical purposes. She will be 
treated at the discretion of her treating physician and success and failure will be determined based on treatment 
course as described below.
Success
Success of this management arm will be complete resolution of hCG from the serum after either uterine 
evacuation only (situation “a”) or after uterine evacuation and MTX administration (situation “b”), without 
further surgical intervention.
Failure
I)Failure of MTX management is defined as the need for surgical intervention to treat a persistent or ruptured 
ectopic pregnancy. The need to administer additional doses of MTX to treat a persistent ectopic pregnancy will 
be collected as a secondary outcome, but will not be defined as failure of this management arm because 
additional doses of methotrexate as necessary are part of the protocol for medical management of EP.
II)The need to perform a second uterine evacuation to complete a miscarriage or to treat heavy bleeding will be 
considered failure of this management arm.
6.1.3Active management B: Empi[INVESTIGATOR_372196], treatment will proceed directly to intramuscular MTX. The MTX should be 
administered within two days of randomization. For specifics regarding administration of MTX utilizing the 2 
dose protocol, see Appendix B.
If a woman is randomized to receive MTX but is ineligible due to screening with safety laboratory 
abnormalities, she will not receive MTX, but will remain in the allocated treatment arm for statistical purposes.

16She will be treated at the discretion of her treating physician and success and failure will be determined based
on treatment course as described below.
Success
Success of this management arm will be complete resolution of hCG from the serum after MTX administration, 
without surgical intervention.
Failure
I)Failure of MTX management is defined as the need for surgical intervention to treat a persistent or ruptured 
ectopic pregnancy. The need to administer additional doses of MTX to treat a persistent ectopic pregnancy will 
be collected as a secondary outcome, but will not be defined as failure of this management arm because 
additional doses of methotrexate as necessary are part of the protocol for medical management of EP.
II)The need to perform a uterine evacuation to complete a miscarriage or to treat heavy bleeding will be 
considered failure of this management arm.
6.2Data Collection
Information collected includes baseline information, treatment allocation, and the clinical course of each 
subject.
6.2.1Serum and Plasma samples
Serum and plasma samples will be obtained to assess for potential molecular markers of success at 
randomization (before treatment) and at approximately weekly intervals until resolution, as available. These 
samples will be obtained at the time of a clinical blood draw and will be banked. Residual serum from clinical 
tests will also be collected (if available) and banked for future assessment of serum predictive markers. Serum 
samples will be collected at all sites. Plasma samples will be collected at the University of Pennsylvania only.
Testing on these blood samples may include a proteomic screen and assessment of a panel of exploratory 
proteins potentially including but not limited to: ADAM 12, Inhibin A, Progesterone, Activin A, Vascular 
Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein, Pregnancy-associated plasma 
protein-A (PAPA), Glycodelin, Placental growth factor 1 (PI[INVESTIGATOR_12252]).
These blood samples may be used for genetic testing in the future. An example of potential genetic testing 
would be polymorphisms in genes involved in implantation, messenger RNA of proteins associated with early 
pregnancy or micro RNA.
6.2.2Baseline information
Baseline information will include:
Demographics: age, race, ethnicity, site of treatment
Past gynecologic, obstetric and medical history
Characterization of the presenting signs and symptoms:
a) chief complaint
b) amount of pain (scale of 1–10)
c) bleeding (none, scant, light, heavy)
Results of laboratory tests: including hCG and relevant chemistry, hematology, blood type, and transvaginal 
pelvic ultrasound
Optimal Treatment for a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12, 
2018, 2015
176.2.3Follow up visits
Data collected at all follow up visits will include:
Date
Location (outpatient, emergency room, inpatient)
Change in symptoms (increase or decrease in pain and or bleeding)
Serum hCG value and other relevant laboratory values (hematology, chemistry, if ordered)
Results of ultrasound (if performed)
Adverse events
Procedures performed (i.e. dilation and evacuation, injection with MTX, laparoscopy)
This process will be continued until the persistent pregnancy of unknown location has resolved (hCG <5 
mIU/mL) or a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy has been made and treated.
6.2.4Final Diagnosis Categorizations
Final diagnosis will be categorized as: resolved persistent PUL, histological non-viable IUP, and non- 
visualized EP (8). (See Figure 1 below.)
Figure 1: Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL)
If an EP is diagnosed, information on initial treatment (medical vs. surgical) and success of initial treatment will 
be collected.
The groups will also be compared as to the percentage of women diagnosed with each outcome. For example, 
women randomized to uterine evacuation will limit the diagnosis of resolved PUL or treated PUL as the 
procedure will more likely result in the diagnosis of EP (when uterine evacuation demonstrates no chorionic 
villi but the hCG value rises post-op) or nonviable IUP (when uterine evacuation demonstrates chorionic villi 
and thus the diagnosis of nonviable IUP is made).
6.2.5Quality of Life, Acceptability, and Cost
A questionnaire assessing side effects and satisfaction and time away from work will be administered 3 weeks 
after management plan is initiated (range can be 2-4 weeks) (See Appendix C).

Optimal Treatment for a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12, 
2018, 2015
186.2.6Long term follow up
To assess fertility after the operation of the index persisting pregnancy of unknown location, the patient will be 
contact[CONTACT_372233] a questionnaire, every six months for a period of 24 months (See Appendix D).
Questions will focus on the desire for pregnancy, contraceptive use, infertility treatment, and the occurrence of 
any pregnancies and their outcome (including live birth, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy). If a 
hysterosalpi[INVESTIGATOR_372197] a diagnostic laparoscopy with chromopertubation is performed to assess the status of 
the tubes, the results will be recorded in the Case Record Form. However, assessment of tubal patency by 
[CONTACT_3553] a hysterosalpi[INVESTIGATOR_372197] a diagnostic laparoscopy is not part of the protocol.

197 Statistical Plan
7.1Sample Size Determination
The assumptions for sample size for this aim include allocation to expectant vs. active management (Table 1) 
AND when allocated to active treatment, equal allocation to one of two active treatment arms (Table 2). Thus 
the overall allocation is 1:1:[ADDRESS_465771] a 25% “failure” rate for expectant management: (3, 12, 13, 14). A recent randomized trial 
demonstrated that the failure rate for expectant management was approximately 40% for women with EP (13/32 
(40.6%) (16).  We anticipate that the failure rate in this trial will be approximately one half of that value 
because it is estimated that one half of the woman will have EP (and the other half miscarriage). Thus, failure 
rate of 25% for expectant management will be compared to an estimated failure rate for active management.
This failure of medical management for a PPUL is based on a modification of the failure rate for MTX to treat 
an EP. The failure of MTX to treat EP in the literature ranges from 8–25% (14, 15, 16, 17) with a population 
based estimate of 14.7 % (2). Specifically, we have demonstrated a failure rate of 13% for the 2 dose study 
protocol (20). The failure rate of MTX for a PPUL or non-visualized EP in this protocol is purposely lower 
than other estimates in the literature because not all women will have an EP. Also, women who do have a non- 
visualized EP are good candidates for successful medical management, with lower than average failure rates 
(21, 22). Thus, we estimated the failure rate in ‘Uterine evacuation followed by [CONTACT_372225]’ to be 6%. The 
failure rate in ‘Empi[INVESTIGATOR_372193]’ is estimated to be 8% to account for a number of women who actually 
have a miscarriage (not an EP) that are not successfully treated with MTX. Medical management of a 
miscarriage with MTX is not the optimal treatment and some women will ultimately need a uterine evacuation. 
A failure rate of 7% (the average of 6% for ‘Uterine evacuation followed by [CONTACT_372225]’ and 8% for 
‘Empi[INVESTIGATOR_372193]’) will be used as the expected failure rate of active management.
The primary hypothesis will test the superiority of active management (both active management arms 
combined) to expectant management with 90% power. The sample size requirement for the comparison of 25% 
failure vs. 7% failure requires 160 women allocated to active and 80 women allocated to expectant management 
(Table 1). With this sample size we will conclude that if the difference between active and expectant 
management is greater than 18%, active treatment is superior. This is a clinically relevant difference.
The sample size is determined to achieve 90% of power if the absolute difference is at least 18%. This 
difference will be lower when the active treatment is less successful and/or the expectant management is more 
successful. An absolute difference of less than 18% (or an hypothesized absolute failure rate for expectant 
management of less than 25%) would be considered clinically acceptable and would provide evidence to 
support its use.

20Our secondary hypothesis is to determine which active management strategy is optimal. To address this
question we proposed using a non-inferiority approach to the two active management arms (Table 2). With 1:1 
randomization within the active treatment arm (80 in each active management strategy), assuming failure rates 
of 6% vs. 8%, with 80% power, we can test a non-inferior margin of 12%. Therefore, if one arm has an 
absolute failure rate above the upper limit for the CI (13%) it will be considered non-inferior. If the two failure 
rates are similar, and within the bounds of the CI, secondary outcomes will be considered to assess which is 
optimal.

anticipated recruitment of [ADDRESS_465773] that recruitment will take 2-3 years.
7.2Statistical Methods
The percent failed of initial treatment course will be compared for each study arm, using logistic regression 
models which will include adjustment for site and any covariates determined to be imbalanced among the 
treatment arms. The primary analysis will assume 'Intent to Treat' (ITT) principles, whereby [CONTACT_372235]. An “as treated” participant analysis will also be conducted, but 
considered secondary.
For our primary hypothesis, we hypothesize that there will be a higher failure rate for expectant management, 
compared to active management (both active management arms combined). For our secondary hypothesis we 
anticipate that the lowest failure of assigned active treatment will be uterine evacuation followed by [CONTACT_372236] (active management strategy A) because this strategy will treat women with a 
miscarriage (with uterine evacuation) and will treat women with EP with MTX. The “failure” rate of empi[INVESTIGATOR_372199] (active management strategy B) will be higher, as MTX is not always 
effective for women with a miscarriage (as they may need uterine evacuation later). If efficacy of active and 
expectant management is similar (or if the two active management strategies are similar) we will evaluate 
secondary outcomes and a cost effective analysis (see below).
Secondary outcome measures will be compared among the treatment arms. These outcomes include:
Number of ruptured ectopic pregnancies in each group
Quantification of re-interventions needed to manage a woman with a PPUL
Optimal Treatment for a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12, 
2018, 2015
21o Outcomes include:
number of interventions beyond that of intended initial strategy in each group
oadditional number of MTX injections
oadditional surgical procedures
uterine evacuation (or dilation and curettage)
laparoscopy
laparotomy
Treatment complications
Adverse events
Number of procedures (lab tests, ultrasounds)
Number of visits
Time to resolution
Patients’ preferences
Acceptability
Future fertility (if desired)
Above and beyond the success or failure of the initial treatment method, the clinical consequences of the 
morbidity of the intervention and the percentage of failed treatment is also of great importance. Taking into 
account these factors, as well as cost, it is hypothesized that expectant management may be less slightly 
effective, but preferable. Alternatively in the comparison of active strategies, empi[INVESTIGATOR_372200].
A cost effectiveness analysis is planned based on the cost and frequency of secondary outcomes (including 
medical tests, procedures and office visits). Financial costs and charge per procedure will be ascertained for 
this analysis using national averages. The cost effective analysis will be conducted from the perspective of the 
payer.
Optimal Treatment for a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12, 
2018, [ADDRESS_465774] of 1996 (HIPAA). Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the following:
What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study
Who will have access to that information and why
Who will use or disclose that information
The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the 
ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For subjects that have 
revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts will be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital 
status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.
Loss of confidentiality is prevented through omitting personal identifiers in the research database. The dataset 
available to the researchers will identify patients by a unique ID number unrelated to any personal identifiers, 
and will be stripped of identifying information such as medical record number, name, contact [CONTACT_372237]. A single web-based database will be used for all sites, but clinicians will 
only be able to view patients from their own hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/practice site.
8.2Records Retention
Per 21 CRF 312.62, it is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least 2 years 
after the investigation is discontinued and the FDA is notified. These documents should be retained for a longer 
period if required by [CONTACT_16477]. In such an instance, it is the responsibility of the sponsor 
to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

239 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting (Technical Aspects)
9.1Study Monitoring
A monitoring plan that satisfies the Guideline for Monitoring of Clinical Investigations of the National Cancer 
Institute will be used. A Project Manager from the DCC will lead this effort, and report findings to the DCC PI. 
The Project Manager will have full knowledge of the study protocol, Manuals of Procedures, and is familiar 
with the database system and is trained to review patient charts. The Project Manager will be responsible for 
training and supervising other personnel.
Once personnel at a participating site are trained to recruit patients, the Project Manager will be sent to the site 
to help initiate the study according to the study protocol, and to ensure that the clinical site meets the scientific, 
clinical, and regulatory requirements. For example, the Project Manager will review all signed and dated forms 
required by [CONTACT_1622] (such as financial disclosure forms), the curriculum vitae and certifications of the 
investigators and personnel, CRF training, and the written IRB approval of the protocol and consent form.
The on-site monitor will return to the clinical site after a defined number of patients are recruited (can be as 
early as the recruitment of the 2nd patient) or a certain time period has passed, depending on the enrollment 
duration of the protocol execution. The schedule of visits will be discussed and agreed in the Steering 
Committee and we anticipate that the Project Manager will visit each participating site at least once.
During the site visit, the clinical sites should provide to the monitor a space and access to all relevant records 
including medical records and regulatory binders, and there would be immediate verbal feedback provided to 
the site after original source documents are compared to entries in the CRF. The clinical sites must agree to 
cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are 
resolved. The on-site monitor will conduct an audit of a random sample of entered information against the 
source documents, a review of all regulatory documents, a review of all informed consents, and a review of all 
pharmacy logs. The clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_254231]. The 
monitor will review electronic data from all sites, providing a method for identifying systematic errors or 
problems.
To assure Good Clinical/Laboratory Practice, the monitor will control adherence to the protocol at the clinical 
sites and evaluate the competence of the personnel at the clinical sites including the ability to obtain written 
informed consents and record data correctly. The monitor will inform the DCC PI, the Steering Committee, and 
NICHD regarding problems relating to facilities, technical equipment, or medical staff. A thorough written 
report will follow each site-visit and will include a detailed itemization of discrepancies and items requiring 
follow-up or reconciliation. This report will also be forwarded to the research scientist at NICHD for review.
The monitor will be responsible for maintaining regular contacts between the investigators in the clinical sites 
and the RMN. When the study ends, the monitor will also visit the clinical site to provide assistance for close- 
out.
9.2Safety Monitoring
Safety of this study will be closely monitored. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will evaluate the 
data at midpoint of recruitment and at the reporting of each serious adverse event (SAE). An interim analysis 
will be scheduled for safety after one half (138) of the subjects complete the trial. If safety or efficacy is an 
issue, one arm will be dropped or the study stopped. A two-arm study would still have clinical value.

2018, 2015
249.3Adverse Events
Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during 
the course of the study. Not all events that would traditionally be defined as AEs will be collected for this trial. 
Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should not be regarded as adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic 
procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:
results in study withdrawal
is associated with a serious adverse event
is associated with clinical signs or symptoms
leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests
is considered by [CONTACT_372238] a number of expected side effects related to women at risk for ectopic pregnancy including 
mild abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and nausea. There are also a number of expected side effects 
related to medical management (nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headaches, fatigue, loss 
of appetite) and surgical management (nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headaches, 
fatigue, loss of appetite, vaginal bleeding, surgical site incision pain). Some of these symptoms will be 
collected as part of patient satisfaction and quality of life (patient self reports). The only non-serious 
events that will be otherwise specifically collected and classified as AEs for this study are those that are 
both unexpected and considered to be related to study procedures or study drug.
Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the 
following outcomes:
•Death
•Life-threatening (see Note A)
•Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
•Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (see Note B)
•A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
http://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/howtoreport/ucm053087.htm.
Note A: the term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious adverse event” refers to any serious adverse 
event that places the patient or subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form might have 
caused death.
Note B: the term “disability” in the definition of “serious adverse event” refers to a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
Note C: There are two serious adverse events that are expected and related to the condition of ectopic 
pregnancy: life threatening event due to rupture, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_372201]. 
In addition, salpi[INVESTIGATOR_372202] a woman permanently infertile if her 
other tube had been previously removed.
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_372203] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring
Optimal Treatment for a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12, 
2018, [ADDRESS_465775] administration of study treatment.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316117] a serious adverse event. Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse 
event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in 
the following circumstances:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting 
condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery 
was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].
The trial will be discontinued if a death or life-threatening adverse event related to the use of MTX, and not 
related to the underlying condition, occurs.
9.4Reporting Adverse Events
All serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur from the start of study drug through [ADDRESS_465776] be reported. A serious adverse event is defined as: fatal or immediately life-threatening; 
severely or permanently disabling; requiring or prolonging inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; overdose (intentional or 
accidental); congenital anomaly; pregnancy loss after 20 weeks gestation; neonatal death up to 6 weeks after 
delivery; or, any event adversely affecting the study’s risk/benefit ratio. Additionally, any event that, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above is considered an SAE.
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_372204] [available in 
the “Study Forms” section of the RMN members-only website], and then emailing the document in PDF format 
to [EMAIL_7171]. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_34161]. No other identifying 
information will be included on the form. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_372205], and if it is related, possibly related, or unrelated to participation in the 
research.
DCC staff will enter the SAE information in the central database and the Safety Surveillance team, consisting of 
the DCC, NICHD research scientist and lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_87031], will analyze the SAE to determine if it meets the 
criteria listed in the OHRP 45CFR46 and/or FDA 21CFR312.32 & 3.14.80.

DSMB’s assessment of the information reviewed; and the DSMB’s recommendation, if any, for the DCC.
The RMN CC will then forward the DSMB report to the DCC for the record and appropriate disbursal. The DCC 
will forward reportable events to all RMN investigators, NICHD, and the FDA on behalf of the NICHD if the 
protocol is under IND. The NICHD Project Scientist will review, sign, and return the IND safety report to the 
DCC within [ADDRESS_465777] relevant safety information to the DSMB. If an adverse event not initially 
determined to be reportable to the FDA under 21CFR312.32 is so reportable, the DCC will report the adverse 
event to the FDA within 15 calendar days after the determination is made.

10.1Overall Policy
The publications policy proposes guidelines for publications that originate from our collaborative Reproductive 
Medicine Network. Decisions concerning publications shall be determined by [CONTACT_21128] (majority vote) of the 
collaborating principal investigators (or designate) noted below as the "Network". This policy is designed to 
promote prompt, exact, quality publications and presentations of Network studies with appropriate academic 
recognition of those with significant contributions. Protocols are classified into three types: ‘Main Study’ (which 
may include major and minor publications), ‘Ancillary Study’, and ‘Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]’. Additionally there may be 
publications from concepts or ideas generated by [CONTACT_372241] (“Related Publications”) or from other groups utilizing 
RMN data and/or specimens “Outside Studies” (those utilizing data and/or specimens from the RMN studies). 
Abstract submissions to national meetings will also follow the publications policy below. The progress of 
publications (including presentations) will be a standing agenda note on all phone conferences and meetings. The 
Steering Committee will make the final disposition regarding disputes with respect to analysis request approval, 
prioritization, presentation, authorship and/or manuscript submission.
10.2Main Study
A Main Study is a Network study designed prospectively by [CONTACT_372242]. 
Generally that investigator becomes Lead investigator of the protocol and Chair of the Protocol Subcommittee. 
At the end of each Main Study, a primary analysis resulting in the primary manuscript and a number of secondary 
analyses is produced based on the research questions stated in the protocol. The Protocol Subcommittee Chair is 
the primary author of the primary analysis. A main study can generate major (related to the major hypotheses) 
and minor publications (relating to secondary hypotheses).
10.2.1Major Publications
A major publication is defined as one reporting results of the major hypotheses tested. (For example, does 
hMG/IUI increase cyclic fecundity in couples with unexplained or male factor infertility?).
1.Authorship: Publications will include the names of investigators from each RMU and the DCC rather than 
merely identify the “Reproductive Medicine Network”. Each RMU and DCC will have up to two authors per 
publication, ordinarily the PI [INVESTIGATOR_79761]-PI, but this may at times involve another investigator who has contributed 
to the study at their site, in lieu of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-PI. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_372207]. No more than 2 authors may represent a RMN site. An ancillary site (such as a SCCPIR) may 
only have [ADDRESS_465779] will be authors. Occasionally, additional authors, both 
within and outside the RMN may be appropriate. In these cases, the final decision will be by [CONTACT_372243] 
(majority vote of the steering committee required).
2.First Author: The lead investigator initiating the protocol, chairing the Protocol Subcommittee will be the first 
author. The first author would always be expected to prepare the initial draft of the manuscript, after receiving 
approval from the Network to proceed. The author will prepare the first draft of the manuscript in a timely fashion 
after receiving all the relevant data analyses from the DCC. The primary author will circulate the final draft to all 
authors prior to submission, with a timely turnaround of comments from other authors expected. Final decision 
of the manuscript content will be determined by [CONTACT_372244]. In the event that the initiating 
protocol investigator declines first authorship or fails to meet the timeline determined by
[CONTACT_372245] a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12, 
2018, 2015
32the Steering Committee (as determined by [CONTACT_184472]) and monitored monthly, the next RMU investigator in
the rank order of authors (described below) will be the first author.
3.Authorship Order: All authorships are expected to meet reasonable criteria as set forth by (International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals.  
http://www.icmje.org. Updated February 2006. Accessed April 4, 2007. ) The overall authorship order will be 1) 
the primary author, 2) RMU investigators, additional outside investigators with a limit of one author per site (e.g. 
SCCPIR investigators if applicable), followed by [CONTACT_372246], NIH Project Scientist, and then 
the authors of the DCC.

Inquires that show data was accurately entered will not count against this rate of data inaccuracy. Each site’s PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_372208]’s authors. In the event the journal editor 
requires fewer authors even after written documentation of the authors’ contribution has been provided, the 
steering committee will vote on the authorship order which will include at a minimum the Lead Investigator and 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_108200] (or his/her designate) in the positions listed above with the authorship order ending with the 
footnoted statement “for the Reproductive Medicine Network”. The other authors will be referenced in the 
footnote and listed in the title page.

2018, 2015
334.Acknowledgement Section: The acknowledgement section will include other investigators and study personnel 
who contributed substantially to the study by [CONTACT_3725], as well as members of the Advisory Board and the Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board. The designation will list the initials of the individual followed by [CONTACT_254273] 
(e.g. C. L. Gnatuk, J.L. Ober, R.N., etc.). Significant contributions include but are not limited to protocol review, 
initiation and participation at each site, subject recruitment and enrollment, study conduct, data analysis, and 
preparation of the manuscript.
10.2.2Minor Publications
Minor studies are defined as those in which the hypotheses would not be the main elements of Network studies, 
but in which the study data base would be utilized to test secondary hypotheses. (One example would be testing 
whether metformin use spares the dose of clomiphene resulting in lower dose needs.) Ideas for "minor studies" 
will, in general, be proposed by a single individual, who would direct all efforts leading to publication and 
representation. The results from minor studies would be handled similarly to those from major studies. The 
“Protocol” is defined as the Concept Protocol/study design of the hypothesis resulting in the publication.
Authorship will follow the Major publications guidelines above with the exception that the individual leading the 
minor study would be the first author, followed by [CONTACT_372248][INVESTIGATOR_372209]. The Lead Investigator of the minor publication can propose additional investigators who 
contributed to the study, whose inclusion in the authorship will be voted on by [CONTACT_40972] (majority 
vote of SC required for inclusion in authorship). Centers may wish to withdraw inclusion from authorship of 
publications of minor studies in which only data are contributed, and this will be the decision of the individual 
site (RMU) PI.
10.[ADDRESS_465782] be a need for collection of additional data not already collected in the Main Study. An 
Ancillary Study may also be designed by [CONTACT_372249], who would serve as the lead 
investigator and primary author of the paper. Ancillary Studies may be a “single-center” or “multi-center”. 
A “single-center” Ancillary Study is a study in which all data are collected, stored and analyzed at a single 
center. The center bears the additional cost of such a study. The study requires approval of the Main Study 
Protocol Subcommittee and the Steering Committee. The center conducting the study is responsible for the 
analysis and reporting of the results. Abstracts and manuscripts resulting from data from the single-center 
Ancillary Study are not subject to the RMN Publications Policies.
A “multi-center” Ancillary Study is defined as one for which data or material (such as specimens) are collected 
at more than one center, or additional funds for conduct of the study are provided by [CONTACT_372250]. Multi-center Ancillary Studies require the approval of the Main Study Protocol 
Subcommittee and the Steering Committee.
Authorship will be as per Major publications above with the exception that the individual leading the ancillary 
study and writing the paper would be the first author, followed by [CONTACT_372251], etc. A 
center not participating in the ancillary study would not receive authorship unless by [CONTACT_372252].
10.4 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]
A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_372210] a preliminary study that generates data to help in the design of a Main Study and is the 
responsibility of the Main Study Protocol Subcommittee. The DCC collaborates with the Protocol Committee
Optimal Treatment for a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12, 
2018, [ADDRESS_465783] for presentation and/or a manuscript for
publication. The DCC writes a Final Report if there is sufficient data to justify one. It is not expected there will 
be any secondary analyses resulting from a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116].
10.[ADDRESS_465784] from an ancillary publication in that a 
related publication reports on a study, concept or new methodology that has not been subjected to formal 
DSMB review and approval. Generally, “Related Publications” will arise from ideas and studies discussed with 
the Steering Committee, but not voted upon to become formal protocols.
The investigator who initiates, conducts and writes the study and those who (s)he names will be the sole 
authors. The authors should acknowledge the contribution of the NICHD Reproductive Medicine Network in 
the author line of the publication according to the format of the journal.
10.6 Outside Studies
Outside studies will result from the sharing of intellectual property, data and/or specimens with investigators 
whose protocols have been approved by [CONTACT_181127], and who comply with all components of those 
policies. All publications will acknowledge the assistance of NICHD, the RMN, and the Protocol Subcommittee 
in making the database available on behalf of the project. In addition, however, a disclaimer will need to be 
included stating, “The contents of this report represent the views of the authors and do not represent the views 
of the NICHD Reproductive Medicine Network.” The authors will be requested to cc the submitted manuscript 
to the NICHD program official to ensure compliance. These policies apply to both Network centers and outside 
centers.
10.7 Presentations
Network data should be presented before national organizations by [CONTACT_372253], 
Ancillary, and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]. Organizations that might be appropriate include the American Society of 
Reproductive Medicine, the Society for Gynecologic Investigation, the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, the American Urology Society and other urology or andrology societies. All presentations will 
be approved by [CONTACT_941] P & P committee. Once data are published in at least abstract form, all members of the 
Network can cite them publicly in lectures.
However, investigators should avoid citing specific numbers in review articles and chapters, for this could 
jeopardize peer review publication. Authorship, First Author, and Author Order are as described for Major 
Publications, and if there is an authorship limit to the abstract we will follow the plan above under Major 
Publications. Oral and poster presentations, including those resulting from secondary analyses at professional 
societies, must list all authors and participating institutions. In addition, they must include both the NICHD 
RMN logo and NIH Department of Health and Human Services logos that can be found on the Network web 
site.

The members of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) identified in this Charter for the ACTorNOT 
study are responsible for safeguarding the interests of study participants, assessing the safety and efficacy of all 
study procedures, and shall monitor the overall conduct of the ACTorNOT trial. This Committee will serve as an 
independent advisory group to the Director of NICHD, and is required to provide recommendations about starting, 
continuing, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_372216].
This Committee is responsible for identifying mechanisms to complete various tasks that will impact the safety 
and efficacy of all study procedures, and overall conduct. The table below identifies the key areas where oversight 
is necessary and the ways in which the Committee for the ACTorNOT study will complete those tasks.

Organizational Chart
The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the DSMB and other entities in the ACTorNOT 
study.
Communication
Communication for members of this DSMB will be primarily through the NICHD Program Office and, where 
applicable, the Data Coordination Center (DCC). Investigators from the ACTorNOT study will not communicate 
directly with DSMB members about the study, except when making presentations or responding to questions at 
DSMB meetings or during scheduled conference calls.
4.Conflict of Interest and Compensation
It is extremely important that all members of the DSMB state any real or apparent conflicts of interests at the 
onset of the study. Members of the DSMB shall read the NICHD Clinical Research Guidance Document regarding 
Conflict of Interest and provide their signed summary of any COI for the study, at its onset, to the NICHD 
Committee Coordinator, [CONTACT_372269]. A table summarizing any COI within the DSMB is provided in the 
Appendix.
Prior to each meeting, all members of the RMN DSMB will have an opportunity to state whether they have 
developed any new conflicts of interest since the meeting. As a new COI is identified it must be documented in 
the table in the Appendix and a new signed summary of the COI should be provided to the NICHD Committee 
Coordinator. The Coordinator will forward the COI documentation to the DCC for record-keepi[INVESTIGATOR_24069].
If a new conflict is reported, the Coordinator and staff will determine if the conflict limits the ability of the DSMB 
member to participate in the discussion.

(insert role, for example: DSMB
member)
for the  
(insert project or study name)
agree to the following statements.
□I agree to:
protect the interests and safety of study participants;
uphold the integrity of the research process including data collection and analysis to be as free from bias and 
preconception as I am able;
adhere to the highest scientific and ethical standards, to comply with all relevant regulations and to eliminate 
or disclose, during my involvement with the proposed clinical research project, any real or apparent conflicts 
of interest.
In addition:
□I declare that I, my spouse or dependent children, or organization with which I am connected, do/does not have any 
financial interest in the study, where financial interested is defined by [CONTACT_254283], as anything of 
monetary value, including but not limited to, salary or other payments for services (for example, consulting fees or 
honoraria); equity interests (for example, stocks, stock options or other ownership interests); and intellectual property 
rights (for example, patents, copyrights and royalties from such rights).
The financial interest term does not include various items which can be found in The Federal regulation, PHS, DHHS Part 
50--Policies of General Applicability; Subpart F- Responsibility of Applicants for Promoting Objectivity in Research for 
Which PHS Funding Is Sought.
For Federal employees, financial interests that are allowable and require disclosure are:

58Optimal Treatment for a PPUL – A Randomized Clinical Trial Version 6.0: November 12,

Financial Interest Disclosure: Financial interest that require disclosure are stock holdings in pharmaceutical firms, medical 
device manufacturers, and biotechnology companies
Allowable Financial Interests: In a company that produces a product that is being evaluated by a study, participants may 
hold up to $15,000 of stock: and up to an aggregate of $25,000 of the stock of that company and its competitors who 
produce that (or a similar) product. As an alternative to individual stock holdings, participants may hold up to an 
aggregate of $50,000 in sector mutual funds-including pharmaceutical/health care sectors.
For holdings in excess of these de minimus levels, a conflict of interest analysis needs to be conducted by [CONTACT_372260], the company producing the product being evaluated under the study, and its competitors, and, if a conflict 
exists, could lead to the need to withdraw from the study.
□I agree to not withhold any data related to the study or to interfere with the analysis or 
publication of the study’s results.
□I will not engage in activities that could be viewed as real or apparent COI, including but not limited to:
□having a part-time, full-time, paid, or unpaid employee status of any organizations that are: (a) involved in the 
study under review; (b) whose products will be used or tested in the study under review, or whose products or 
services would be directly and predictably affected in a major way by [CONTACT_58435];
□being an officer, member, owner, trustee, director, expert advisor, or consultant of such organizations;
□being a current collaborator or associate of the principal investigator (applicable to potential members of data 
safety and monitoring boards);
□having a scientific interest beyond that required for my role, where scientific interest is defined as having 
influence over the protocol, the study design, conducting the study analysis or any reporting related to the 
investigation (applicable to potential members of data safety and monitoring boards).

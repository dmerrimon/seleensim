3. Introduction  
3.1 Background  
The QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) has gained clinical importance, primarily because 
prolongation of this interval can predispose to a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia known as 
torsades de pointes, which could in turn lead to sudden cardiac death [1].  Multiple factors have been implicated in causing QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Among these, an important risk factor 
for long QT syndrome is the use of QT prolonging drugs. A QT interval greater than 500 milliseconds (ms) 
has been shown to correlate with higher risk of torsades de pointes.  
There are several commonly used medications that could lengthen QT and cause QT prolongation. One 
such class of medications are antiarrhythmic drugs which are used to treat heart rhythm disorders. 
These drugs are frequently prescribed in everyday clinical practice for the management of atrial 
fibrillation (AF) that affects nearly 1 –2% of the general population [2,3]. The commonly used 
antiarrhythmics for AF rhythm control management belong to Vaughan Williams’ classes, Ic and III. Both 
these medication cate gories are well known to influence ventricular depolarization and repolarization, 
alter QT and corrected QT interval (QTc) intervals on surface ECG and affect to variable extents the left 
ventricular (LV) function [4 –10]. 
There are several studies which have assessed the effect of antiarrhythmic drugs on QT interval 
prolongation. One such study [11] revealed significant QTmax and QTc interval prolongation following Sotalol (from 424 ± 40 ms to 460 ± 57 ms and from 446 ± 35 ms to 474 ± 48 ms, respectively, both p < 
0.01) and Amiodarone (from 437 ± 41 ms to 504 ± 39 ms and from 469 ± 35 ms to 527 ± 50 ms, respectively, both p < 0.01). Another study [12] revealed a significant mortality benefit when dofetilide 
was used in patie nts with baseline QTc intervals less than 429 ms (risk ratio 0.3), while an increase in 
mortality was seen with dofetilide therapy in patients with baseline QTc intervals greater than 429 ms 
(risk ratio 1.3) [13].  
Currently, there is no reliable way for continuous and long- term monitoring of QT intervals in patients 
undergoing antiarrhythmics drug loading. An implantable cardiac monitor which can continuously monitor QT intervals in patients taking QT prolonging drugs can enable clinicians to track day -to-day 
variability in the QT intervals and also study long -term QT trends in patients.  
LINQ QT Study Clinical Investigation Plan 
  
[ADDRESS_964297] with a minimally invasive procedure and provide continuous 
monitoring of diagnostic parameters for up to 3 years  and 4 years respectively. An algorithm [14] has 
been developed and validated which can continuously measure QT intervals for every beat using LINQTM 
ECG.  This study is aimed at determining if QT interval changes can be detected during and after 
antiarrhythmic drug loading by [CONTACT_709230].  
3.2 Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to determine if QT interval changes are detected during and after 
antiarrhythmic drug loading by [CONTACT_709230]. The QT intervals 
before and after antiarrhythmic loading will be compared for all patients to analyze QT changes that 
may be caused due to antiarrhythmic drugs.

patient activation between 1 -4 times daily. Patients will need to be instructed to perform a manual 
transmission every night using the MyCareLink® home monitor. 
For patients with LINQIITM implants, the patients will be requested to use patient activation 2-3 times a 
day throughout the follow up period of 90 days.  
Note:  The preferred daily timings to perform the patient activations would be immediately before 
and then 2 hours after the medication intake. In addition, daily 10 -second nightly transmitted

III. Follow up clinic visits  
 
1. Subjects with LINQTM Implants  
After the index antiarrhythmic drug loading event, for patients with LINQTM implants, additional LINQTM 
DR220 Holter recordings, as well as surface ECG of up to 3 hours may be collected during follow up clinic 
visits (2-week, 4 -week, 8 -week follow up) including the available standard of care in -clinic 12 -lead ECG 
recordings and the corresponding expert measured QT interval values during follow up visits.  
In addition, patients will also be optionally provided with VitalPatch® RTM for continuous monitoring for 
up to 7 days after the follow up clinic visit in order to monitor parameters such as ECG, heart rate 
variability, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, activ ity, and posture.   
If an antiarrhythmic dosage change is recommended by [CONTACT_709231] 90 -days follow 
up period, a LINQTM Holter recording, and a surface ECG recording of up to 3 hours may be obtained if an 
in-clinic visit occurs. In the case of an antiarrhythmic dose change in the 16 -90 days following the index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709218], the patient will be requested to perform 4 patient activations daily for the 
period of 5 days after dosage change. The preferred daily timings to perform the patient activations 
would be immediately before and then 2 hours after the medication intake. Patients will need to be 
instructed to perform a manual transmission every night using the MyCareLink® home monitor. 
At the in -clinic visits, physicians will be requested to record on the eCRF, any arrhythmias detected from 
LINQTM or any external monitoring devices. The physician will also be requested to record the dosage 
levels and the times when the dosage levels are changed. All health care data regarding any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ER and clinic visits, and medication changes will b e collected along with any physician 
notes during the follow up visits. 
2. Subjects with LINQ IITM Implants  
After the index antiarrhythmic drug loading event, for patients with LINQIITM implants, surface ECG 
recordings of up to 3 hours may be collected during follow up clinic visits (2 -week, 4 -week, 8 -week 
follow up) including the available standard of care in -clinic 12 -lead ECG recordings and the 
corresponding expert measured QT interva l values during follow up visits.

analysis.  
5.2 Rationale  
Safety will not be a primary focus of this study as 1) the study is only collecting observational data, 2) 
data collected will not be used to manage the treatment of subjects in the study, 3) data collection 
procedures other than those related to the LINQTM/LINQIITM are not outside standard of care and 4) the 
safety profile of LINQTM/LINQIITM is already well known.

investigator (or authorized designee as required by [CONTACT_472543] [ICF]) have each personally 
signed and dated the ICF.  
8.[ADDRESS_964311]’s voluntary agreement to participate in a particular clinical study after information has been given to the subject on all aspects of 
the clinical study that are relevant to the  subject’s decision to participate. This process includes obtaining 
an ICF and an Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health Information/Research 
Authorization/other privacy language as required by [CONTACT_181010]’s 
Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) and signed and dated by [CONTACT_423].  
Investigators shall consider all subjects who meet eligibility requirements for study participation to avoid 
any bias in the subject population.  Prior to enrolling subjects, approval of the CIP, ICF, and any other 
written study information to be provided to the subjects must have been obtained from each site’s IRB/EC.  
The document(s) must be controlled (i.e., versioned and dated) to ensure it is clear which version(s) were approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  Any adaptation of the sample ICF must be reviewed and appr oved by [CONTACT_709234]/EC reviewing the application prior to enrolling the subject.  
The investigator must notify the subject of any significant new findings about the study that become 
available during the study which are pertinent to the safety and well -being of the subject, as this could 
impact a subject’s willingness to participate in the study.  If relevant, approval may be requested from 
subjects to confirm their continued participation.  
The informed consent form template will be sent under a separate cover.   
Prior to initiation of any study -specific procedures, informed consent must be obtained from the subject.  
Likewise, privacy or health information protection regulation may require subjects to sign additional forms 
to authorize sites to submit subject information to the study sponsor.  The informed consent process must 
be conducted by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee, and the ICF and Authorization 
to Use and Disclose Personal Health Information/Research Authorization/other privacy language as 
required by [CONTACT_248974] a language, he/she is able to read and understand.  The process of obtaining informed consent must be conducted without using coercion or undue improper 
influence on or inducement of the subject to  participate by [CONTACT_181014].  The 
informed consent process shall not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights.  The language used 
shall be as non -technical as possible and must be understandable to the subject and the impartial witness, 
where applicable.

[ADDRESS_964312], and that informed consent was freely given.  
A copy of the ICF and the Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health Information/Research 
Authorization/other privacy language, signed and dated as required by [CONTACT_2371], must be provided to the 
subject.  
If informed consent is obtained the same day the subject begins participating in study -related procedures, 
it must be documented in the subject’s case history that consent was obtained prior to participation in any study -related procedures.  It is best practice for the informed consent process to be documented in 
the subject’s case history, regardless of circumstance. 
In the event the subject cannot read and/or write, a witnessed (impartial third party) informed consent 
will be allowed.  In this situation, an independent witness must be present throughout the informed 
consent process.  The written informed consent form and any other information shall be read aloud and 
explained to the prospective subject.  The subject should “make his/her mark” (sign or otherwise physically mark the document so as to indicate consent) on the ICF as well.  The witness must also sign 
and personally date the ICF attesting that the information was accurately explained, and that informed 
consent was freely given.  Detailed documentation of the consent process must be recorded in the subject’s case history.  The ICF should document a supervised  oral process was used for communication 
with the prospective subject and the specific means by [CONTACT_181016].  
The ICF and Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health information/Research Authorization/other privacy language as required by [CONTACT_131476].  Any Medtronic Field personnel who support the Reveal LINQ
TM/LINQIITM ICM insertion procedure must be able to review the 
subject’s original signed and dated ICF and verify its completeness prior to proceeding with the insertion.  In the event the Medtronic Field personnel identify informed consent as being incomplete, the s tudy 
procedure will not be allowed to occur until the consent of the subject can be adequately and 
appropriately obtained.

up period, a LINQTM Holter recording, and a surface ECG recording of up to 3 hours may be obtained if an 
in-clinic visit occurs. In the case of an antiarrhythmic dose change in the 16 -90 days following the index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709218], the patient will be requested to perform 4 patient activations daily for the 
period of 5 days after dosage change. The preferred daily timings to perform the patient activations 
would be immediately before and then 2 hours after the medication intake. Patients will need to be 
instructed to perform a manual transmission daily using the MyCareLink® home monitor . 
At the in -clinic visits, physicians will be requested to record on the eCRF, any arrhythmias detected from 
LINQTM or any external monitoring devices. The physician will also be requested to record the dosage 
levels and the times when the dosage levels are changed. All health care data regarding any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ER and clinic visits, and medication changes will b e collected along with any physician 
notes during the follow up visits. 
 
2. Subjects with LINQ IITM Implants  
After the index antiarrhythmic drug loading event, for patients with LINQIITM implants, surface ECG 
recordings of up to 3 hours may be collected during follow up clinic visits (2 -week, 4 -week, 8 -week 
follow up) including the available standard of care in -clinic 12 -lead ECG recordings and the 
corresponding expert measured QT interva l values during follow up visits.  
In addition, patients will also be optionally provided with VitalPatch® RTM for continuous monitoring for

NOTE:  Subjects may be compensated for completing the required daily activations . 
8.9 Nightly CareLink Data Transmissions  
 
Subjects will be provided with a MyCareLink® Patient Monitor and enrolled in the Medtronic CareLink 
network and will be instructed on how to set up their monitor to support automatic nightly transmission 
of their device data  from the time they are enrolled in the study until they are exited from the study.  
 
LINQ QT Study Clinical Investigation Plan 
  
[ADDRESS_964319] data will be collected on electronic case report forms (eCRFs) via a web-based remote data 
capture (RDC) system. The investigator must ensure accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data 
reported in the eCRFs. Only authorized persons can complete and sign e-CRFs, as specified on the 
Delegated Tasks List included in the Investigator Site File.  
Procedures in the CIP require source documentation. Source documents, which may include worksheets 
and subject medical records, must be created, and maintained by [CONTACT_131493]. Subject 
records must be clearly marked to indicate that subject participates in the study. When copi[INVESTIGATOR_709223], these must be signed and dated by a member of the investigational site 
team with a statement that it is a true reproduction of the original source document.  
Device data from transmissions will be uploaded to secure servers.  Media/USB data collected at office 
visits will be sent to Medtronic.  Upon receipt, device data will be maintained with databases and retrieved 
for analysis and reporting.  
8.[ADDRESS_964320] in an emergency or in unforeseen situations 
beyond the investigator’s control (e.g., subject failure to attend scheduled follow-up visits, inadvertent 
loss of data due to computer malfunction, inability to perform required procedures due to subject  
illness). 
For medically justifiable conditions which preempt a subject’s ability to complete a study -required 
procedure, it may be permitted to report only one deviation which will apply to all visits going forward.  
This may also apply for other unforeseen situations (e.g., the subject permanently refuses to complete a 
study required procedure and the data will not contribute to the primary end point analysis).  However, 
prior approval from Medtronic is required for such situations.   
All study deviations must be reported on the study deviation e- CRF regardless of whether medically 
justifiable, pre -approved by [CONTACT_13735], an inadvertent occurrence, or taken to protect  the subject in an 
emergency.  The deviation description and reason for deviation must be recorded. Multiple deviations of the same type at the same visit may be reported on one e-CRF. 
In the event the deviation involves a failure to obtain a subject’s consent or is made to protect the life or 
physical well- being of a subject in an emergency, the deviation must be reported to the IRB/EC as well as 
Medtronic within five (5) working days.  Reporting of all other study deviations must comply with IRB/EC

soon as possible upon the center becoming aware of the deviation.  Refer to Table 12 for geography 
specific deviation reporting requirements and timeframes for reporting to Medtronic and/or regulatory bodies.  
Medtronic is responsible for analyzing deviations, assessing their significance, and identifying any 
additional corrective and/or preventive actions (e.g., amend the Clinical Investigation Plan, conduct 
additional training, terminate the investigation).  R epetitive or serious investigator compliance issues may 
result in initiation of a corrective action plan with the investigator and site, and in some cases, necessitate 
suspending enrollment until the problem is resolved or ultimately terminating the invest igator’s 
participation in the study.  Medtronic will provide site -specific reports to investigators summarizing 
information on deviations that occurred at the investigational site on a periodic basis. 
8.[ADDRESS_964321] until any ongoing AEs are resolved/unresolved with no further 
actions planned, or until official study closure, whichever occurs first . The date and reason for subject exit 
must be reported to Medtronic at the earliest opportunity via eCRF. Exited subjects will not be replaced. 
Upon exiting from the study, no further study data will be collected, or study visits will occur for the 
subject.  All data available through the time of the subject’s exit will be used for analysis. Subjects are urged to remain in the study as long as possible but may be exited from the study for any  of the following 
situations:  
• Subject did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• LINQ
TM/LINQIITM ICM explanted and not replaced with a new LINQTM/LINQIITM ICM (e.g., diagnosis 
determined, suspected infection, subject request, physician determination)  
• Subject chooses to withdraw (e.g., consent withdrawal, relocation to another geographic 
location)  
• Investigator chooses to withdraw a subject (e.g., medically justified, inclusion/exclusion criteria 
not met, failure of subject to maintain adequate study compliance)  
• Subject lost to follow -up

Subjects may benefit from continuous arrhythmia monitoring with the LINQTM/LINQIITM ICM, as this 
monitoring could result in diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation (or other arrhythmias) and comprehensive 
evaluation of symptoms on an earlier and more conclusive basis than what would be possible without 
an implantable cardiac monitor. Subjects may also benefit from being evaluated more frequently in the 
office according to the study visit schedule.  
The information gained from this study could result in the improved management of other patients 
receiving a LINQTM/LINQIITM device in the future. Additionally, information collected from this study may 
assist in the design of new product(s)/therapy(ies) and/or instructions for use.

11. Statistical Design and Methods  
This is a feasibility study that is exploratory in nature and with no hypothesis. Therefore, justification on sample size is not required . 
 
11.1  General Aspects of Analysis  
Data analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_13735] -employed statisticians or designees.  The LINQ  QT Study is 
exploratory in nature and no hypothesis will be tested with no corresponding power calculations for this 
sample size. The study is expected to be conducted at up to three study sites and will enroll up to twenty 
study subjects.   
The subjects’ baseline status will be summarized with standard descriptive summary statistics, including 
counts and percentages for categorical variables, and mean, standard deviation, median,  quartiles and 
range for continuous variables. For each of the objectives the available data will be summarized, and 
missing data will be discussed. The main analysis of the study objectives will be based on available data 
and missing data will not be imputed.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_964328] completed the study.  
 
11.2.1 Primary Objective #1  
 The primary objective of the study is to determine if QT changes can be detected from LINQTM/LINQIITM 
ECG that may occur during and after antiarrhythmic loading. The QT intervals before and after 
antiarrhythmic loading will be compared for all patients to analyze QT changes that may be caused due 
to antiarrhythmic drugs.

 Analysis Methods : Descriptive summary statistics will be used for this objective.  
 Determination of Subjects/Data for Analysis : All subjects with data available will be included for this 
objective. 
 
11.3  Sample Size Determination 
 
There are no sample size requirements as this is an observational study with no hypothesis for the study 
objective. A sample size of up to 20 enrolled subjects was selected assuming sufficient data can be 
collected from this cohort to explore the relationship between measured QT intervals from LINQ
TM/LINQIITM before and after antiarrhythmic drug intake.  
 
11.4  Minimization of Bias  
 
Selection of subjects, treatment of subjects, and evaluation of study data are potential sources of bias. 
Methods incorporated in the study design to minimize potential bias include (but are not limited to):  
 Subjects will undergo screening to confirm eligibility with defined inclusion/exclusion criteria prior 
to enrollment. 
 All sites will use the same version of the Clinical Investigation Plan and electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs). 
 All investigational site personnel and Medtronic personnel will be trained using standardized training materials.  
In summary, potential sources of bias that may be encountered in this clinical study have been considered and minimized by [CONTACT_54415].

 CONFIDENTIAL  056-F275 Rev E Clinical Investigation Plan Template  13.9.2 Management of Primary and Ancillary Publications  
The Publication Committee reviews, prioritizes, and manages all publications including primary and 
ancillary publications.  Primary publications are those that address analyses of the primary objective as 
specified in the Clinical Investigation Plan. An an cillary publication is any publication that does not 
address the primary study objective identified in the Clinical Investigation Plan.  They include 
publications proposed and developed by [CONTACT_600554], other Medtronic departments or 
entities, clinicians participating in this clinical study, and clinicians not participating in this clinical study.  
The committee will work with Medtronic to ensure that requests do not present conflicts with the 
primary results, other proposals, are not duplicative, and to determine which ancillary publication 
proposals, if any, will be supported.   
The committee may decide that no publications, including abstracts, will be published prior to the end of the study or with individual site data.  Requests for publications on study objectives utilizing subset data 
(e.g., regional) will be evaluated for scientific validity and the ability of Medtronic to provide resources.   
13.9.3 Criteria for Determining Authorship 
Publications will adhere to authorship criteria defined by [CONTACT_4717] (ICMJE, Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals, 
www.icmje.org).  Individual authorship criteria defined by [CONTACT_131503].  
Decisions regarding authorship and contributor ship will be made by [CONTACT_600554]. The 
selected authors will be responsible for drafting the publication. All selected authors must fulfill ICMJE authorship conditions to be listed as authors.  
All investigators not listed as co -authors will be acknowledged as the “Medtronic LINQ QT Study 
Investigators” and will be individually listed according to the guidelines of the applicable scientific journal when possible. Any other contributors will be acknowledged by [CONTACT_54464].  
13.9.4 Transparency  
Transparency of study results will be maintained by [CONTACT_54465]:  
• A final report describing the results of all objectives and analysis will be distributed to all 
investigators and IRBs/ECs and Competent Authorities of participating countries when required by [CONTACT_1769]  
• Registering and posting the study results on ClinicalTrials.gov based on the posting rules stipulated  
• Submitting for publication the primary study results after the study ends  
• Disclosing conflicts of interest (e.g., financial) of the co -authors of publications according to the 
policies set forth by [CONTACT_54466]  
• Making an individual site’s study data accessible to the corresponding investigator after the completion of the study, if requested

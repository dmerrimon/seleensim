 DEVELOPMENT OF A COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL MOBILE APP FOR BODY 
DYSMORPHIC DISORDER – PHASE II: TEST OF  EFFICACY  
 
I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
A. Background  
 
BDD is  a psychiatric illness that involves a preoccupation with an imagined  or greatly exaggerated defect 
in one’s physical  appearance (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013 ). This obsessive 
preoccupation cause s clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning  (e.g., social, occupational 
functioning) . BDD is also defined by  [CONTACT_484839], compulsive behaviors p erformed in response to 
appearance concerns, such as frequent mirror checking (Alliez & Robin, 1969), excessive grooming 
(Vallat et al., 1971), and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_41875] (Phillips & Taub, 1995). BDD is classified as an Obsessive 
Compulsive Related Disorder in the D SM-5, to reflect its similarities with obsessive compulsive disorder 
(OCD).  
 
Individuals with BDD often have poor insight, such that the individual fixedly believes that their 
appearance is truly defective. In fact, approximately one third of patients have  delusional  beliefs (Phillips , 
2006a ). Delusions in BDD focus solely on one’s appearance , in contrast to  severe psychotic illnesses like 
schizophrenia . Individuals with BDD also experience high rates of comorbid major depression (i.e., in 53-
81% of cases) and elevated risk for suicide (Frare  et al., 2004; Phillips et al., 2005; Phillips et al. , 2007) . 
BDD’s  early onset and chronicity underscore the need to widely disseminate  effective treatments.  
 
Cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best -studied and most promising form of psychological  
treatment for BDD ( for meta -analysis see Harrison et al., 2016 ). CBT for BDD  is a time -limited 
psychotherapy focused on targeting maladaptive thinking and self -defeating behaviors. Specifically, CBT 
aims to teach  patients how to identify and challenge  maladaptive  thoughts  (“cognitive therapy,”  [CT] ), 
while reducing safety behaviors such as rituals and avoidance  (“behavior therapy, ” [BT] ). Most studies 
have included both cogni tive and behavioral components, consisting mainly of exposure and response 
prevention (ERP) to reduce social avoidance and repetitive beh aviors (such as mirror checking) and have 
shown that CBT is effective for BDD in both group (Rosen, Reiter, and Oros an, 1995; Wilhelm et al., 
1999) and individual formats (Mc Kay et al., 1997; Neziroglu et al., 1996; Veale et al., 1996; Wilhelm et 
al., 2019) . Furthermore, one recent study has developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested an Internet -based CBT treatment 
for BDD (Enander et al., 2016). Participants were randomly assigned to receive  either [ADDRESS_623067] 
support via the online program. Those in the CBT group showed significantly greater improvement 
compared to those in the supportive  psychotherapy arm, and 56% of those in the CBT group were 
treatment responders compared to 13% in the supportive psychotherapy arm (Enander et al., 2016). 
Secondary outcomes such as depression and quality of life also showed significantly greater improvem ent 
in the CBT group compared to supportive psychotherapy group, suggesting that technology- based CBT 
treatments for BDD may be feasible, safe, and effective.   
 
B. Rationale for Proposed Research , and Potential Benefits to Participants and/or Society:  
 
While well -validated treatment for BDD exists, CBT fo r BDD is highly specialized and, thus, very 
difficult for patients to access. At our specialty program (the MGH BDD Program), there are consistent 
waitlists of [ADDRESS_623068] for BDD. In rural locations, access to this 
specialized treatment is likely to be even more challenging . Untreated BDD has a chronic, unremitting 
course , underscoring the importance of access to  treatment . Inadequate treatment access due to limited 
professionals offering this specialized treatment  is compounded by [CONTACT_484840] 
 
4 
 preventing many sufferers from seeking in- person care (Fang et al., 2014) . Mobi le app -based CBT would 
solve the access gap by [CONTACT_484841].  
 
To this end, development of a high-quality CBT mobile app based on our program’s empi[INVESTIGATOR_484827], ranging from the severe 
end (i.e., BDD), which occurs in 1.7-2.4% of the population (Fang et al., 2014) to milder subclinical body 
image disturbances, which occur in nearly half the population (Cash & Henry, 1995), by [CONTACT_7932]-
cost, rapid, widely available access to CBT for BDD.  The app may  also benefit healthcare providers 
(e.g., psychologists, psychiatrists, dermatologists) as it could be used as either a stand -alone treatment or 
in conjunction with treatments with a provider. We recently developed a smartphone-delivered CBT 
treatment for BDD and examined its preliminary feasibility and acceptability in participants seeking 
treatment for BDD (see study record [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . In this trial, we sought to test the efficacy of the 
smartphone- delivered CBT treatment for BDD.   
 
II. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
The purpose of this project was to test the efficacy  of a mobile -app version of CBT  treatment for BDD.  
 
Specific Aim  1: In a waitlist -controlled trial , we will test  the efficacy  of the active treatment arm  
compared to a waitlist in reducing primary (i.e., BDD severity ) at end -of-treatment (week 12).  
 
Primary Hypothesis: We hypothesize that participants receiving app -based CBT for BDD will 
have greater improvement in BDD -YBOCS scores than those in the waitlist condition at 
treatment endpoint (week 12).  
 
Specific Aim 2 : In a waitlist- controlled trial, we will test the efficacy of the active treatment arm 
compared to a waitlist in reducing secondary outcomes (e.g., delusionality, quality of life, social and 
occupational functioning, depression) at end -of-treatment (week 12) . 
 
Secondary Hypothesis: We hypothesize that participants receiving app- based CBT  for BDD will 
have greater improvement on secondary clinical outcome measures (i.e. , depression (QIDS- SR), 
delusionality (BABS), functional impairment (SDS), and quality of life (Q -LES- Q)) than those in 
the waitlist condition at treatment endpoint (week 12). 
 
 
III. SUBJ ECT SELECTION  
 
Overview:  
 
[LOCATION_005] General  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_484828]. We 
collaborated with Koa Health B.V. , a in the testing of the app. 
 
For this Phase [ADDRESS_623069] control trial , our target sample size was 80 eligible individuals with 
primary BDD (for details, see section VI -D “Power analysis”) . Detailed eligibility criteria for each aim 
follow. Additionally, a detailed plan for safety and risk management is described below . 
 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:  
 
1. Inclusion criteria 
a. at least [ADDRESS_623070] participat ion in > 4 sessions of C BT for BDD  
c. Current severe substance use di sorder  
d. Lifetime bipolar disorder or psychosis 
e. Acute, active suicidal ideation  as indicated by [CONTACT_405296]/or a score > 2 on the 
suicidal ideation subscale of the  C-SSRS.  
f. Current severe comorbid major depression,  as indicated by [CONTACT_405296]/or  a 
QIDS -SR total score ≥ 21   
g. Concurrent psychological treatment  
h. Does not own a supported mobile Smartphone with a data p lan  
i. Lack of technology literacy that would interfere with ability to engage with smartphone 
treatment  
   
A. Source of Subjects and Recruitment Methods:  
  
Overview: 
 
Participants were informed about the study through advertisements on public transportation, OCD and 
BDD-focused organizations nationally (e.g., International Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Foundation, 
Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), by [CONTACT_484842], fliers posted in specialty clinics  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], coffee shops, restaurants, laundromats, barber 
shops, churches, daycares, libraries, newspapers, universities, other public locations, through our 
program’s website and the recruitment website created for this study, Partners Clinical Trials, listservs 
(e.g., MGH Broadcast), on the Internet , search engine platforms , and in online support groups and social 
media . Individuals were  also recruited as part of the BDD clinic’s general recruitment protocol.  Interested 
individuals were  referred to the study research assistant ( RA), who provided more information about the 
research study and assessed  preliminary eligibility over the telephone. We  also used a screening 
questionnaire on REDCap; the link to access this screener was  embedded within our recruitment website.  
 
IV. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT 
 
A.  Procedures for obtaining informed consent and assessing eligibility  
 Interested and eligible participants were  invited to complete the baseline assessment with a trained 
independent evaluator ( IE) by [CONTACT_484843] , phone, or Virtual Visit, a Partners IS -approved, 
secure, HIPAA- compliant video call ing program (see more Virtual Visit information below: “Monitoring 
and Quality Assurance”) , as recruit ment wa s nation- wide .  At that time, patients were  informed about the 
study’s purpose and procedures in more detailed and were advised regarding alternative treatmen t 
options. Before eligibility  was assessed, trained clinician -level staff  obtain ed electronic informed consent  
through REDCap , a secure data capture system  (see more REDCap information below : “Monitoring and 
Quality Assurance”). The person obtaining informed consent also verified the participant’s identity by 
[CONTACT_405302] a form of identification (e.g., government- issued driver’s license). Subjects were  given 
as much time as they need ed to consider participation. Participant s had the ability to download and print 
or save the electronic informed consent document. The research assistant also emailed participants a 
signed pdf copy of the consent form for their records.   
 
6 
 B. Treatment assignment and randomization (if applicable)  
 
Eligible subjects were  randomized to immediate app -based CBT for B DD or to a waitlist control 
condition (50/50 chance). Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_4317]’ medication status, in order to  
evenly distribute any potential medication effects on treatment response across both study arms. The 
waitlist control group allow ed us to determine whether active treatment is superior to gains afforded by 
[CONTACT_484844] (e.g., history, maturation, testing). Those beginning the 
CBT treatment immediately were  taught to download the app and received a brief tutorial in using the 
app-based treatment. Following the waitlist period, participants randomized to this condition were  crossed 
over to app- based CBT to allow assessment of within -subject treatment gains for control participants. The 
duration of CBT for waitlist participants was  the same as for participants who we re treated first with 
CBT.   
Wait Period:  To maximize th e validity of our study, we match ed the duration of the waitlist condition to 
that of the CBT condition. We successfully used a similar design in the PI's prior BDD trial assessing in-
person individual CBT. Furthermore, Veale et al (1996) has shown that patients do not improve on a 12-
week waitlist and that this duration is tolerated by [CONTACT_484845] . To protect the safety of participants 
assigned to the waitlist condition, participants who had active suicidal ideation at the screening 
assessment w ere not eligible to participate in this trial  (see Exclusion criteria). Additionally, individuals 
with severe comorbid major depression were  not eligible to participate this trial  (see Exclusion criteria) . 
The waiting period fo r standard care for BDD at MGH is at least 3-[ADDRESS_623071] condition. 
 
V. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 Following screening and randomization, participants completed s elf-report measures for the baseline 
assessment through a secure REDCap link e mailed to them . In this trial, we aimed to evaluate changes in 
primary symptoms as well as to  examine secondary and exploratory outcomes, including treatment 
feasibility and acceptability (e.g., retention and reasons for treatment refusal and dropout, expe ctancy, and 
motivation), and changes in depression, functional impairment, delusionality, and quality of life. Therapeutic progress will be broadly assessed with measures of beliefs, behaviors, mood, functioning, and quality of life before, during, and aft er treatment.  
 Study Visits and Procedures
 
 
Phone Screen: Phone screen procedures were as described above.  
 
Screening Calls and Randomization Procedures: Procedures were as described above.  
 
Assessments : Participants in both conditions were assessed at regular intervals: at  baseline (week 0), mid-
treatment (week 6), end -of-treatment (week 12), and a 3- month follow -up visit (for details, see Table 1 
below). Masters or doctoral -level study IEs conducted clinician- rated assessments, and participants 
completed self -report questionnaires on the computer via REDCap, a secure data capture system.  Please 
see the schedule of assessments and measures administered (relevant to the primary and secondary aims 
of this trial) at each time point in Ta ble 1. Assessments  require d approximately [ADDRESS_623072] been well- tolerated by [CONTACT_4317]. 
To avoid dropout, participants were  paid $[ADDRESS_623073] efforts 
to retain participants, we expected  dropouts. Except for subjects who withdre w consent to participate, all 
 
7 
 who we re withdrawn or drop ped out of the study were  asked to complete all scheduled assessments and 
were  provided remuneration for participation in assessments . 
 
3-month Follow-up Feedback to Technologists: Participants could choose to meet with technologists from 
Koa Health (sponsor) via a Partners- approved, secure, HIPAA -compliant clinical video platform 
(Healthcare secure Zoom ) at the 3 -month follow -up, for the technology experts to obtain input and 
feedb ack on the usability and feasibility of the CBT app. This meeting would take approximately 1.5 
hours, and participants would be reimbursed $25 for completion of the 3- month follow -up feedback visit 
with technologists.

 Measures Descriptions  
 
Diagnostic Measures  
 
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.):  The M.I.N.I.  (Sheehan et al., 1998 ) is a 
semi -structured diagnostic assessment of DSM-5 psychiatric illnesses. The M.I.N.I. is efficient, reliable, 
and well-validated. I t was  the sole/primary diagnostic evaluation used  to assess for psychiatric diagnoses 
and establish inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 
Assessment of Body Image and Related Symptoms 
 
 Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for BDD  (BDD- YBOCS)  : This gold -standard 
12-item semi-structured clinician- administered scale rates past-week BDD symptom severity (Phillips et 
al., 1997). It will be the study's primary outcome measure. The BDD- YBOCS has excellent internal 
consistency ( α=.80), interrater and test -retest reliability (ICC for total score=.99 and .88, respectively), 
convergent validity (r=.55 with the CGI), and sensitivity to change (Phillips et al., 1997). 
 
 BDD-Symptom Scale  (BDD -SS):  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_484829] -SS to rate the severity of specific 
BDD symptoms (Wilhelm et al., 2016). It will be used in the present study to obtain a broader assessment 
of participants’ BDD symptoms and associated thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.  
 
 Clinica l Global Impression – Improvement Scale (CGI -I) and severity scale (CGI -S): This rating 
scale, which ranges from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), is commonly used in clinical 
trials (Guy, 1976). P articipants complete d a CGI for BDD symptoms (CGI -BDD) and the IEs  complete d a 
CGI for BDD symptoms (CGI- BDD) and overall symptoms (CGI-global). The CGI was  a secondary 
outcome measure and was also used to determine clinical deterioration of BDD (see Minimizing Risks, 
below). The CGI also has a severity scale (CGI -S) which was  rated by [CONTACT_484846]. The CGI -S 
determines the patient’s level of severity, in comparison to others the IE ( clinician ) has treated or assessed 
with the same diagnosis.  
 
   Psychiatric Status Rating Scale  for Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD PSR) : The BDD PSR 
(Phillips et al., 2006b; Phillips et al., 2013) is a 7- item, clinician -completed rating scale of the patient’s 
BDD diagnostic status. It ranges from 1 (Full Remission) to 7 (Meets full diagnostic criteri a with 
extreme/severe BDD).  
 
 Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS ): This 7 -item semi -structured clinician -administered 
interview assesses delusional thinking related to one’s appearance concerns (Eisen et al., 1998). It has very strong psychometric pr operties, including internal consistency, interrater and test -retest reliability, 
convergent validity, divergent validity, and sensitivity to change (Eisen et al., 1998). 
 
Patient Health Questionnaire- 2 (PHQ- 2): The PHQ -2 (Kroenke & Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], 2002) self- report 
measure of depression severity includes 2 Likert scale items ranging from 0 ( not at all ) to 3 ( every day ). 
The 2 items are taken from the longer PHQ -9 measure and are selected because they assess the core 
diagnostic symptoms of depression. The PHQ-2 was  administered weekly via the app to monitor changes 
in depression symptom severity.  
 
 Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS- SR): The QIDS -SR (Rush et 
al., 2003) is a self -report measure of depressive symptoms consisting of 16 scale items with responses 
ranging from 0 to 3, including one suicide item (item #12). Higher scores correspond with greater 
depression severity, and the measure is well-validated, sensitive measure of symptom severity in 
depression. The response choices on the suicide item include 0: “I do not think of suicide or death”; 1: “I 
 
 
11 
 feel that life is empty or wonder if it’s worth living”; 2: I think of suicide or death several times a week 
for several minutes”; and 3: “I think of suicide or death several times a day in some detail, or I have made 
specific plans for suicide or have actually tried to take my life”. S cores on the QIDS -SR were  used to 
evaluate eligibility at the screening visit, and to measure self- reported depressive symptoms at subsequent 
assessment  visits . The QIDS -SR i12 was  delivered weekly to participants via the app (in the active group) 
or via REDCap (in the waitlist group) to monitor for risk concerns during the trial. Scores >0 trigger ed a 
popup message to the participant about calling 911/going to the ER, and participants were provide d 
information about contact[CONTACT_30697] a suicide hotline. Scores >1 also  trigger ed a text message alert to the coach 
with the specific item response given by [CONTACT_2299] (i.e., 2 vs. 3). S tudy clinician s follow ed up with 
the participant within 24 hours by [CONTACT_484847], and to refer to a higher level of care if 
clinically indicated (see Minimizing Risks, below). After an initial alert for a participant, study clinicians used clinical judgement when determin ing follow -up for additional alerts.  
 
 Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS):  The C -SSRS (Posner et al., 2011) is a  gold -
standard, clinician -administered assessment of suicidal ideation and suicide behaviors. The baseline 
version, which assesses both lifetime and recent time frames,  was used to establish eligibility at the 
baseline/screening visit.  The “Update” version, which assesses suicide risk since the last assessment, was 
used at subsequent study administrations. 
 
 Body Parts of Concern List : This list names a wide range of body parts that are the most common 
areas of appearance concerns for BDD patients. The measure asks participants to indicate which body 
parts they are preoccupi[CONTACT_213229].  
 
Assessment of Functioning and Quality of Life 
 
 Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) : The SDS uses a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) 
to assess impairment in occupational, social, and family domains. It has strong internal consistency and 
validity (Sheehan et al., 1996).  
 
Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questio nnaire – Short Form (Q- LES-Q-SF): The Q -
LES-Q-SF (Endicott, Nee, Harrison, & Blumenthal, 1993) is a self-report measure of subjective quality of 
life. Higher scores correspond with greater ratings of quality of life. The Q -LES-Q-SF has strong 
psychometric properties (Endicott et al., 1993).   
 
Assessment of Expectancy, Motivation and Satisfaction  
 
 Credibility and Expectancy  Questionnaire (CEQ) : This 6- item self -report questionnaire assesses 
patients’ judgments about the credibility of the treatment rationa le, expectancy of change, and treatment 
acceptability (Borkovec & Nau, 1972). It has good reliability ( α=.81- .86), and validity is evident in its 
ability to differentiate between treatment rationales (Devilly & Borkovec, 2000).  
 
 The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire  (CSQ) : The CSQ is a 25 -item self -report questionnaire 
which assesses the satisfaction with clinical services received. It has excellent internal consistency and good discriminant validity (McMurtry & Hudson, 2000). 
 
 Open -Ended Feedback Question: is a 1 -item open- ended question to obtain feedback from the 
participant after completion of each treatment module. The question asks, “Can you describe what you liked and didn’t like about this activity?” Participants provide a free- text response.  
 
  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_623074] 
forms : These forms together were  used to assess any current medications (past 2 months) taken as well as 
any current or lifetime psychosocial treatment.  
 
Lifetime Psychiatric Medication Form : This self -report form collected lifetime psychiatric 
medications taken and was administered at the baseline screening visit.  
 
Concomitant medication and therapy form:  This log track ed any changes in medication and 
therapy that the participant made since the prior assessment.  
 
 Demographics Form : This self -report form collect ed basic demographic data and was 
administered at baseline.  
 
Treatment Utilization Questionnai re: This self -report form measures how much time participants 
are practicing treatment skills both on and off the app. It was completed as a self- report measure at the 
mid-treatment assessment and end of treatment visits.  
 
App Feedback Questionnaire (Basel ine): This self -report questionnaire asks about participant’s 
expectations of using the app (e.g., “How frequently do you intend to use Perspectives?”) 
 
App Feedback Questionnaire (Midpoint) : These multiple choice/open-ended questions ask 
participants to describe their ongoing perceptions of the app at midpoint (e.g., “ How easy are the 
exercises to understand, overall ?”).  
 
App Feedback Questionnaire (Endpoint):  This self-report form collect s participant feedback 
pertaining to the cont ent and aesthetics of the app (e.g., “How clear was the layout of the app?”)   
 
Technologist Interview Notes: This interview guide asks about credibility/expectancy, client 
satisfaction, and improvements at  trial completion . Of note, technologists from Koa Health who 
conduct ed over- the-phone feedback interviews were hired and paid by [CONTACT_456], Koa Health. These 
interviews we re not considered part of the human subjects research and wa s development work for the 
app. Therefore, they we re not included as study staff, but the informed consent process fully inform ed 
participants about the interactions with technologists and as such, these procedures are described in full in 
this protocol. MGH study staff introduced participants to the technology experts via phone call or  email 
introduction after the participant wa s fully consented. This serve d to protect participants’ identifying 
information (e.g., we did not share access to participants’ email addresses or phone numbers, but rather 
MGH study staff -initiate d conference calls and scheduled appointments between participan ts and 
technologists).  
 
Treatment Condition Questionnaire : This brief measure will be used to assess whether the 
independent evaluator believes each subject was assigned to either immediate CBT or waitlist, as well as 
their confidence in this belief. This questionnaire was  completed at the end-of- treatment assessment  (i.e., 
the week 12 visit). This measure is based on Bang’s 2x5 Blinding Index (Bang et al., 2004). 
 
Life Events Questionnaire: This question will be used to assess whether any major life events 
occurred that might have had a psychological impact on the subject.

App-Based Data 
 
Data from sensors in participants’ mobile phones were  collected, to optimize the program through 
personalization  and improve the app. ( For a detailed description of storage and protection of de- identified 
mobile data, see Monitoring and Quality Assurance, below.)  
 
Applicatio n Usage Metrics: To improve the usability of the application , usage metrics may be collected 
(for example , operating system version and device model, time and date when the application is opened or 
closed, time spent on each page visited, notification timing, etc.).  
  
The Treatment  
 
The CBT app included the following components of CBT for BDD: 1) education about a CBT model of 
BDD;  2) use of self -monitoring to record trigger situations and symptoms;  3) cognitive techniques to 
identify and challenge distorted thoughts related to one’s BDD; 4) exposure to avoided situations;  5) 
response prevention to decrease repetitive behaviors; 6) mindfulness/  perceptual retraining (to help 
patients to learn to balance distressing emotional states with rational thinking and to control their 
attentional processes); 7) inc reasing valued activities, and 8) relapse prevention (to teach patients to 
expect and react effectively to setbacks that may occur during times of stress).  Details of the app -
treatment are described further in the manuscript of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Wilhelm et al., 2020).  
 
Treatment Length: We tested  a 12- week  version  of app -treatment . Twelve -week CBT treatments for BDD 
have been tested previously and shown to be acceptable and effective (e.g., Veale et al., 2014) , including 
in a computer- delivered format (Enander et al., 2016). Participants had  access to the Perspectives app and 
coach support throughout the 12- week treatment. During the follow -up phase of the study, participants 
continued to have access to the Perspectives app, but without the coach support or messaging system.   
 
Module Frequency and Duration:  An advantage of app-based CBT for BDD is that participants were able 
to self-direct the frequency and duration of modules, and they were able to  re-visit sessions as many times 
as is useful to them.  
 
Treatment Format: Each treatment component was presented through modules on the mobile app, and 
exercises were  logged and practiced through the app on participants’ smartphones . Upon initiating the 
app-based CBT treatment, each participant was assigned a BA -level coach  with some  training in CBT and 
some familiarity with BDD ; coaches will be supervised weekly by a licensed psychologist (see “Coach  
Training and Qualifications,” below ). Participants were able to  communicate with their coach  through a 
secure messaging system incorporated into the app  throughout the 12- week treatment . The coaches had  a 
separate portal inside the Partners firewall to receive and respond to these in- app co mmunications from 
patients. The coach  communication aim ed to provide support and additional motivational enhancement to 
patients, and to provide feedback about the skills and homework that the patients were  learning through 
the app. Patients were  notified that the ir coach  would  respond to all in-app communications within 36 
hours on weekdays. Moreover, brief phone check -ins could be arranged between the participants and 
coaches on an as -needed basis to supplement the chat system (e.g., to more thoroughly answer a 
participant question about a skill, help set goals for 2nd half of treatment at treatment mid -point, evaluate 
and enhance motivation). During the [ADDRESS_623075] access to the app between the 3- month and 12-
month follow- up assessments. Based on a similar, online CBT treatment for BDD (Enan der et al., 2016) 
 
 
14 
 and our own feasibility and acceptability trial (Wilhelm et al., 2020) , we expect ed average coach  contact 
[CONTACT_484848] (e.g., less than 15 minutes per week, per patient).  
 
In-App Coach Training and Qualifications:  BA-level coach es were  study staff members with a 
Bachelor of Arts ( BA) or Bachelor of Science ( BS) degree  in Psychology or a related field. Based on 
preliminary findings from our feasibility and acceptability trial, we anticipate d that the coaches’ 
involvement would be light -touch and focus mostly on motivation and problem -solving, as needed, 
whereas the app itself would  be the primary mode of treatment delivery. Specifically, in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_484830] 2.5 minute s per patient per week on average responding to chat messages. Research 
on technology- based treatments likewise suggests that coaches primarily serve to motivate patients and 
increase accountability and adherence. Coaches receive d training before assisting  in treatment as a coach  
(e.g., complet ing the  MGH Psychiatr y Academy CBT training course for BDD)  and were  requi red to pass 
(>90% correct) the  MGH Psychiatry Academy BDD knowledge test. To ensure ongoing high- quality 
treatment, study staff member s who wer e licensed clinician s with expertise in CBT for BDD provide d 
weekly supervision to coaches, with additional supervision as needed if questions ar ose. 
  
IE Training and Qualifications, and Procedures to Ensure Assessment Integrity and Interrater 
Reliability   
 
Assessments were  conducted by [CONTACT_484849] s (IE) who ha d Masters or Doctoral -level degree in 
clinical psychology or related mental health field s and who were  employed at MGH.  The IE s were  
otherwise uninvolved in study procedures. Training and reliability checks were  done to ensure that IEs 
conduct ed ratings in a uniform way. Raters first receive d instruction in the SCID -I/P, MINI, SCID -II, 
BDD- YBOCS, BABS, and CGI from [CONTACT_405334] or another gold -standard expert rater, prior to 
beginning as an IE. The IE s were then  supervised twice monthly  by [CONTACT_978]. The IE were  required to 
demonstrate reliability on the BDD -YBOCS and BABS at a criterion of .[ADDRESS_623076] rater. All assessments were  audiotaped for reliability 
ratings. Names were not  included on digital recordings. To reduce rater drift, a trained reliability rater 
meeting the same qualifications as the IE review ed 15%  of randomly s elected audiotaped interviews at 
regular intervals . IEs were blind to randomized conditions.  
 Privacy and Confidentiality  
 
All information gathered was  kept strictly confidential. We adhered to the following procedures to protect 
privacy and confidentiality:  
1) Participants  were  assigned a code number  (study ID) that was used in all email communications or 
shared data files outside of the secure MGH lab server or Partners Dropbox Business. Pa rticipants’  names 
or other identifying information did not appear on any questionnaires , study documents , digital 
recordings, computerized data files, or published reports . Case records were  reviewed only by [CONTACT_484850], if necessary, by [CONTACT_240825], sponsor -assigned , state, or federal regulatory personnel. 
Research assistants and others working on this study (e.g., technologists) were  educated about the 
importance of strictly protecting participants' rights to confidentiality.  
2) All personnel was  trained in research confidentiality procedures and HIPAA, including completion of 
CITI training and Healthstream training. Only the study personnel (or, if necessary, institutional, sponsor -
assigned, state, or federal regulatory personnel ) had access to the identifiable data.  
 3) Clinical data collected during MGH assessments: Computerized data and digital audio  files were  stored 
de-identified, in password protected files saved on the protected lab server. Data within Partners is stored 
automatically and securely on an MS SQL Server, accessed over industry standard SSL [ADDRESS_623077] c opy data (paper forms) were  stored securely in locked file 
cabinets, within locked offices in the MGH OCD and Related Disorders Program.  
 
4) Technologist data:  Computerized data and digital audio  files collected from feedback interviews with 
technologists were  stored de -identified, in password protected files in the Partners Healthcare Dropbox 
Business folder.  
 
5) Mobile data: All mobile data was transmitted from the participant’s mobile device to the c linical study 
server via an encrypted Internet connection. The clinical study server was  located in the PHS/MGH 
Secure Data Center. The collected data was  linked to the study identifier only. Prior to deployment of the 
digital application, the application was  scanned with Veracode.  
 
6) Telehealth assessments were  conducted using the Partners -approved platform for clinical video calls, 
which has been vetted by [CONTACT_484851] -compliant. Participants were  instructed in 
advance to be in a priva te location (e.g., in a room with closed doors) during the calls.  
 
7) Only de -identified data is  shared with the sponsor ( Koa Health ), under the terms of the Data Use 
Agreement (i.e., Statement of Work).

VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSES  
The IE and the RA  will play the primary role in  data entry. Data will be entered in  REDCap , a HIPAA-
compliant , Partners -approved  platform for electronic data capture that streamlines data collection and 
management, and ensures data integrity, resulting in improved data quality and reduced costs. For more 
information on REDCap, please see section I X, “Monitoring and Quality Assurance.”  
The Center for OCD and Related Disorders biostatistician  was responsible for data management and 
analysis. All project staff receive d training in data management and data confidentiality procedures. Data 
checks were  done regularly  to assure that all forms we re entered and available for analysis. Data and 
 
 
16 
 analysis files w ere be backed up on the lab server and, if paper records were used, were stored in separate 
locked cabinets.  
 
To characterize our sample, data was  displayed graphically, and summary statistics (e.g., means and 
frequencies) were  calculated for all variables, including demographic and clinical descriptors (e.g., from 
the MINI).  
 
Baseline differences between the treatment arms in demographic and other potential prognostic variables 
were  examined using chi- square analyses for discrete variables (if prevalence >10% in the treatment arm 
with the lower prevalence, or Fisher’s exact test if not)  and t- tests for continuous variables. Prior to data 
analysis, all major variables were  screened for inconsistent or abnormal values. C ontinuous measures 
were assessed for skewness and outliers (based on model residuals) ; no data transformations were 
necessary to  meet modeling assum ptions of normality and homogeneity of variance . A two -tailed p -value 
<.05 w as considered evidence of statistical significance for the primary and secondary outcomes. Our 
primary and secondary analyses used generalized linear mixed -effects models ( GLMMs) . GLMMs can 
easily accommodate nesting of repeated observations within subjects, include all who complete at least one assessment (including the baseline assessment), and are the preferred method to analyze longitudinal 
data (Hamer and Simpson, 2009). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_405282], we expect ed dropouts 
(subjects who are lost to follow-up or withdraw early from the study). We attempt ed to perform all 
scheduled assessments for subjects who we re withdrawn from the protocol and provided financial 
incentives for participation in assessments.  Our intent -to-treat sample include d all randomized patients 
who completed at least one assessment , making our primary and secondary analyses intent -to-treat 
analyses. We also perform ed “per protocol” ana lyses. Our per protocol population included all 
randomized patients who completed the baseline and post- treatment assessments, an d who did not initiate 
prohibited treatment during the study. We repeat ed our GLMM analyses using the per protocol sample.  
Drop out, study withdrawal, and loss to follow-up w as tabulated by [CONTACT_106867]. Analyses 
were  conducted to ascertain to what extent dropouts we re nonrandom, and, if so, what factors were 
associated with dropout. To evaluate potential attrition bias , study dropouts were  compared to study 
completers.  
 A. Specific data variables collected for the study (e.g., data collection sheets) 
Specific variables that were  collected and their timeline are presented above in Table 1 and described in 
the Study Procedures section.  
 
B. Study endpoints  
 Primary endpoint: Difference in BDD severity (BDD- YBOCS) at the end of treatment/waitlist period.  
Hypothesis 1:  Participants receiving app -CBT will have greater improvement in BDD- YBOCS  
scores than those in the waitlist condition at treatment endpoint  (week 12) .  
 
Secondary endpoints : Difference in  secondary clinical outcomes at the end of treatment/waitlist period  
Hypothesis 2:   Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on secondary 
clinical outcome measures (i.e., depression (QIDS -SR), delusionality (BABS), functional 
impairment (SDS), and quality of life (Q-LES- Q)) than those in the waitlist condition at treatment 
endpoint (week 12) .  
 
 
C. Statistical methods  
 Primary endpoint: Preliminary efficacy for reducing BDD symptom severity  
 Analysis:  
 
 
17 
 The primary outcome model was a hierarchical mixed model (i.e., GLMM)  that included time 
(categorical; baseline, mid -point, and end-of- treatment), treatment (app -CBT vs. waitlist), and 
their interaction as fixed effects, and model ed time as a repeated measure using either an 
autoregressive (AR1), Toeplitz, compound symmetry, or unstructured covariance matrix, based 
on best fit determined by [CONTACT_484852].  The main hypothesis test was  based on a specific 
contrast of treatment difference at week 12.  Because these analyses included all subjects who 
were randomized and complete d at least one assessment, it was  an intent- to-treat analysis. These 
analyses included only the [ADDRESS_623078] -treatment and did not include the 
follow- up (FU) assessment s, because treatment response could be affected by [CONTACT_484853].  Between -group e ffect sizes were  calculated  using Cohen’s 
d. This analysis was then repeated using the per -protocol sample.  
In addition to the analyses specified above, we described the proportion of subjects in 
each treatment ar m who achieved response, where response was defined as a 30% or greater 
reduction in BDD- YBOCS score from baseline to end of treatment (week 12) . This empi[INVESTIGATOR_484831] -off of 30% reflects clinically significant improvement and is widely used in BDD 
treatment studies (Phillips et al., 1997). While no formal comparison was  made between 
treatments, the reporting of response rates is clinically useful and will facilitate comparison to other studies in the field. We report ed response as observed (excluding subjects with missing data 
at week 12).   
 Secondary endpoint: Prelimina ry efficacy for secondary outcomes 
Analysis:  
We used the same hierarchical mixed model approach as described for the primary endpoint to examine significant differences in secondary outcome measures (i.e., depression severity, 
delusionality, functional impairment, and quality of life) at postt reatment for treated participants 
compared to waitlist control participants. We did  not adjust for multiple testing among secondary 
outcomes based on the recommendation of Cook and Farewell (1996), who argue that multiplicity adjustments are not necessary if separate test results are interpreted marginally and address different aspects of the patient experience and decision -making process rather than alternative 
assessments of efficacy.   
  
 
D. Power analysis 
 
Pre-COVID -19, t he sample size required to test a significant symptom severity difference between the 
app-CBT and  the waitlist control conditions at the end of treatment was estimated to be n=64 (n= 32 per 
group).  The sample size estimates we re based on a single degree of freedom contrast in an ANOVA 
design , implemented in SAS for Windows version 9.4.  The power model used a two-sided alpha=0.05, a 
power of 0.90, equal allocation of participants into both treatment arms  (app -CBT vs. waitlist) , and an 
anticipated effect size of 0.9 .  We further assumed a drop- out rate of 15% by [CONTACT_57627].  Th is 
anticipated effect size of the app -CBT is in the range of effect sizes calculated using the published 
estimate of a waitlist control group BDD -YBOCS mean after 12 weeks (source: Wilhelm et al., 201 4), 
compared to either the combined site mean at week 12 in an in-person CBT treatment study for people with BDD ( d=0.93; Wilhelm et al., 2019) or the mean at week 12 in an internet -based CBT treatment 
study for people with BDD ( d=1.02; Enander et al., 2016).  More generally, large effect sizes for CBT vs. 
waitlist are to be expected, based on meta -analysis by [CONTACT_484854] ( 2015) for the closely re lated 
disorder OCD, which found that the weighted mean effect size of CBT vs. waitlist control was Hedges 
g=1.31, 95%CI: [1.08, 1.55] .  The anticipated drop- rate was based on the weighted mean of drop- out rates 
(14.4%) reported in three studies that examin ed the efficacy of CBT treatment  in participants with BDD: 
one compared to waitlist (n=36, 19.4% drop-out at week 12; Wilhelm et al., 2014), one compared to SPT, 
 
 
18 
 in person (n=120, 23.3% drop- out at week 24; Wilhelm et al., 2019), and one comparing internet -based 
CBT vs. SPT (n=94, 1.1% drop- out at week 12; Enander et al., 2016).  
 In the wake of the COVID -[ADDRESS_623079] likely increased as multiple waves of the pandemic and state -wide measures of 
social interaction restrictions swep t the nation in the foreseeable future. In response, we increased the 
planned sample size to a total n of 80 (40 per group) of participants who start treatment (i.e., those who 
are eligible and willing and able to participate); this increase was intended to  be reflective of a decrease in 
the anticipated effect size from 0.90 to 0.81 (i.e., a 10% decrease of the anticipated effect size).   The plan 
for and justification of the sample size increase was reviewed by [CONTACT_484855].      
 
 
VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
 
A. Complications of surgical and non -surgical procedures  
Not applicable  
 
B. Drug side effects and toxicities  
Not applicable  
 
C. Device complications/malfunctions  
If the app or supporting clinician/coach dashboard malfunctions or does not work for a period of time, the 
patient may be unable to use the app to receive treatment or communicate with their coach.   Similarly, if 
the clinician/coach dashboard were inaccess ible, the coach would not be able to communicate via the app 
with the patient. These risks could result in minor harms to users such as inconvenience or a delay in treatment. If device malfunctions resulted in the patient's in -app weekly questionnaire responses not being 
sent to the coach/clinician, this could result in a delay in clinical response to an elevated safety 
questionnaire. To mitigate risks of a temporary device malfunction, participants we re given the study staff 
and investigators’ contact [CONTACT_484856]. Thus, the clinical and study staff can 
communicate with the participant by [CONTACT_405315]. As with in- person therapy, 
there are times when a therapy session gets cancelled and treatment, as well as we ekly symptom 
assessments, we re thus temporarily delayed. Likewise, in face -to-face therapy, a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_484832] (e.g., on vacation) and backup lines of communication (e.g., pager 
coverage by a colleague) we re put in place i n case of emergencies. Thus, device malfunctions that lead to 
temporary delays in accessing the app functionality are similar to risks associated with temporary delays 
in traditional face -to-face therapy. See also, “Minimizing of Risks and Safety Reporting ” under “D. 
Psychosocial (non- medical) risks” for further description of protections in place.  
 
 
D. Psychosocial (non -medical) risks  
Participants  may feel uncomfortable due to the sensitive nature of the questions they may be asked. 
Likewise, some participants may feel uncomfortable about having assessment sessions digitally recorded 
and reviewed by [CONTACT_60551] (which is necessary for rater supervision as well as assessment of the 
reliability of ratings adherence and competence). Participants could experience an increase in symptoms 
or suicidal ideation related to the natural waxing and waning of BDD  or other psychiatric (e.g., 
depression)  symptoms. BDD can be associated with other psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, 
anxiety) , as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviors, which may also change over time.  Breach of 
confidentiality represents a potential risk. Finally, the treatment procedures, particularly the exposure 
 
 
19 
 exercises, will potentially provoke some anxiety. As discussed be low, we t ook precautions to ensure that 
these potential risks were minimized (see Adequacy of Protection Against Risks below).  
 
Minimizing of Risks and Safety Reporting.  
 
The following procedures were  implemented to protect participants against risks :  
 
1. Participants with active  suicidal  ideation at the screening assessment were  excluded from 
participating (see Inclusion/Exclusion criteria) . If a subject scored ≥21 on the QIDS-SR and/or 
>1 on the QIDS-SR item #12, the independent evaluator follow ed up with a phone evaluation 
within 24 hours and refer red the participant to a higher level of care if clinically indicated.  
Suicidal ideation at screening  was also measured using the C -SSRS (see  Inclusion/Exclusion 
criteria), and if a potential participant scored ≥ 2, a study clinician, PI, or independent evaluator 
conduct ed a risk evaluation with the participant and referred  the participant to a higher level of 
care if clinically indicated.  
 
2. Participants with severe major depressive disorder  were  excluded from participating (see 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria).  
 
3. A disclaimer that is accessible from the home page of the digital CBT program was  presented  to 
remind partic ipants that if they were experiencing suicidal thoughts, they should seek 
professional help or go to the emergency room right away. Links to 911 and suicide hotline numbers were  provided a long with this disclaimer.  
 
4. A general resources page was  available on the app at all times to participants, which included a 
suicide hotline number.  
 
Participants’ clinical improvement or deterioration was  assessed weekly via a participant- rated 
CGI-BDD collected via the app (or REDCap, in waitlist condition). Participants could be 
withdrawn from the study if their clinical condition deteriorate d substantially. Deterioration was  
defined by a combination of (1) a rating of 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse) on the 
weekly, participant -rated CGI -BDD across 2 subsequent weeks and (2) PI [INVESTIGATOR_484833]’s best interest. Of note, a single rating of 6 or 7 
on the weekly, participant -rated BDD -CGI also trigger ed a notification to the clinician /coach  via 
text message and  email . In the case that a BA -level coach was notified that a participant’s CGI 
indicates deterioration, they notif ied a doctoral- level clinician as soon as possible (and within 24 
hours). A stu dy clinician then follow ed up with a phone evaluation within 24 hours of the alert 
and referred  the participant to a higher level of care if clinically indicated.  After an in itial alert for 
a participant, study clinicians could  use clinical judgement when determining follow -up for 
additional alerts.  
 
5. Ratings on the QIDS -SR item 12 (suicide item) were  carefully monitored weekly via the app (or 
REDCap, in waitlist condition) ; a score >[ADDRESS_623080]. Links to 911, as well as a national suicide hotline, were  provided within  this popup 
notification. A score > 1 also  trigger ed notification to the clinician /coach  via text message  or 
email. In the case that a BA-level coach was notified that a participant reported a score>1, they 
notif ied a doctoral -level study clinician as soon as possible (and within 24 hours). A study 
clinician , PI, or independent evaluator then  follow ed up with a phone evaluation within 24 hours 
of the alert and refer red the participant  to a higher level of care if clinically indicated.  After an 
 
 
20 
 initial  alert for a participant , study clinicians could  use clinical judgement when determining 
follow-up for additional alerts.  
 
6. Participants could also be withdrawn if , in the judgment of the PI, remaining in the study posed a 
substantial risk to the participant or a higher level of care is needed.  
 
7. Treatment through app- based CBT  was supplemented with electronic communication with a 
study coach , who could answer questions and guide participants through the treatment as needed. 
See In -App Coach Training and Qualifications , above, for details.  
 
8. The inde pendent  evaluator(s) were  highly experienced, highly trained, and closely supervised.  
 
9. [CONTACT_405334] (the PI) was  available, if necessary, to discuss the study, alternative treatments, or 
any concerns about the study with participants if requested by [CONTACT_2299], coaches, or rater s. 
 
10. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_367314]-investigator and the participants’ study coach were  available to answer study 
questions via the app or phone. T his was  clearly communicated orally and in writing to study 
participants.   
 
11. All participants were  provided with referral resources. 
 
12. The study coaches and raters  (IEs)  made every attempt to help participants feel comfortable 
when discussing sensitive material.  Participants could skip questions on assessments that they 
were uncomfortable answering.  
 
13. If exposure exercises suggested through the treatment a pp we re too anxiety provoking, 
participants were  able to do alternative exercises that caused less anxiety.  
 
14. The CBT treatment initially emphasize d cognitive restructuring, which we anticipate d would  be 
less anxiety provoking than exposure treatment alone and would make exposure more tolerable.  
 
15. Technologists from Koa Health  who conduct ed the technology feedback interviews we re trained 
professional staff with experience conducting patient interviews. They received additional training (including a multi-day workshop) from our team  (MGH OCD and Related Disorders 
Program) on CBT and issues of confidentiality. They completed CITI training.   
16. Three clinical psychologists or researchers familiar with BDD were  selected to serve as a Data 
Safety Monitoring Board, to review the study once a year.   
17. Participants  designate d a relative or friend who could be contact[CONTACT_484857] d concerns about the subject’s well -being. 
 We anticipated that the above procedures w ould be effective in protecting study participants against 
potential risks.

IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 A. Sponsor -initiated monitoring  
Decus Biomedical, Inc. were hired by [CONTACT_484858]. They visited MGH 
to provide feedback regarding ongoing study procedures and data quality.  
 
B. Independent monitoring of source data  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_484834]. All aspects of the study w ere 
conducted in accordance with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s policy on confidentiality.  
 
Paper research records were  kept de -identified, in a locked file in a locked office at MGH. Self -report 
measures and some clinician administered measures were  collected using REDC ap. REDCap (Research 
Electronic Data Capture) is a free, secure, HIPAA compliant web -based application hosted by [CONTACT_484859], Enterprise Research Infrastructure & Services (ERIS) group. Data collection projects rely on a study- specific data dictionary defined by [CONTACT_484860] | The Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center 
EDC Support Staff. The REDCap software allows researchers to design and implement study surveys for 
collecting, storing, retrieving, and manipulating data electronically. The iterative development and testing 
process results in a well -planned data collection strategy for ind ividual studies.  Web -based self -report 
measures rely on a study -specific data dictionary built by [CONTACT_8362]. Once built, 
participants and study staff can enter data directly into REDCap surveys via any computer or tablet with 
standard w eb access and browsers. Pa rticipants  enter ed survey responses directly into an electronic 
assessment form  on subject -facing REDCap , and the responses were  then be transmitted and stored in the 
secured and confidential database. Each participant only ha d access to his or her own survey, but not any 
other  survey data.  All data was collected and stored in complian ce with the Standards for Privacy of 
Individually Identifiable Health Information (“Privacy Rule”) of the Health Insurance Portability Act of 1996 (H IPAA). Any data that was  transmitted electronically was  encrypted and password protected. This 
electronic data capture system precludes the need for subsequent data entry by [CONTACT_3655], thus minimizing 
human error, and resulting in improved data integrity and quality.  All users had defined roles and 
privileges pre -determined by [CONTACT_405329].  Thus, the PI c ould determine the level of access 
for each study staff such that only a limited number or people ha d access to sensitive study data.  
 
We antici pated that the above procedures would  ensure the confidentiality and integrity of study data.  
 
C. Safety monitoring

1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title: Clinical investigation of the safety and effectiveness of FINEVISION HP 
Trifocal IOL  
Study Description: This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double masked 
confirmatory trial comparing an investigational trifocal intraocular lens  
(IOL) and a commercially available monofocal IOL.  
Objectives: 
 Co-primary effectiveness objectives are to:  
• Demonstrate non -inferiority of FINEVISION HP trifocal IOL to the 
control in mean photopic monocular BCDVA (best corrected 
distance visual acuity) for the first operative eye at Month 6 (Visit 
4). 
• Demonstrate superiority of FINEVISION HP trifocal IOL to the 
control in mean photopic monocular DCNVA (distance corrected near visual acuity) for the first operative eye at Month 6 (Visit 4)  
Co-primary safety objectives are to:  
• Estimate the cumulative rate of SSIs related to the optical 
properties of the IOL for the first operative eye up to Month 12 
(Visit 5) 
• Evaluate the mean monocular contrast sensitivity for the first 
operative eye, with and without glare for mesopic conditions and photopic conditions, at Month 12 (Visit 5)  
The secondary effectiveness objective is to:  
• Demonstrate superiority of FINEVISION HP trifocal IOL to the 
control in mean photopic monocular DCVA at intermediate ( 66 cm) 
for the first operative eye at Month 6 (Visit 4)  
The secondary safety objectives are to evaluate:  
• Rates of cumulative and persistent adverse events in first operative eyes at Month 12 (Visit 5) in comparison to the ISO Safety and Performance Endpoint (SPE) rates as described in ISO [ZIP_CODE] -7 
 
Version 1. 7

2   INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness  of the FINEVISION  HP 
Trifocal IOL. 
2.2 BACKGROUND  
Cataracts are a common condition in adults over 40 years of age, and surgical replacement of the 
cataractous lens with an intraocular lens (IOL) remains an effective way to restore vision to cataract 
patients. Monofocal IOLs provide adequate distance visio n but require spectacle use for activities 
requiring near or intermediate vision. Multifocal IOLs, including bifocal and trifocal IOLs, have been 
successfully developed to improve near and intermediate distance vision and increase spectacle independence fo llowing cataract surgery. The FINEVISION  HP Trifocal IOL is designed to provide distance 
vision similar to a monofocal IOL, but with improved intermediate and ne ar vision. 
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
2.3.[ADDRESS_919230] or IOL implant surgery may include t he following:  
1. Ocular infection (endopht halmitis, microbial keratitis)  
2. Inflammatory reaction [ e.g. uveitis, Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS), hypopyon ] 
3. Anterior capsular p himosis 
4. Corneal edema  
5. Corneal endothelial damage  
6. Cystoïd macular edema (CME)  
7. Secondary surgical intervention (including, but are not limited to: lens repositioning, lens 
replacement, vitreous aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], iridectomy for pupi[INVESTIGATOR_32465], wound leak repair, and retinal detachment repair)  
8. IOL dislocation, tilt, decentration, luxation, rotation 
9. Elevated intraocular pressure  
10. Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_32465]  
11. Posterior capsular opacification (PCO)  
12. Chromatic aberrations  
13. Dysphotopsia  
14. Loss of visual acuity  
15. Deviation from target refraction  
16. Hyphema  
17. Retinal detachment  
 
Version 1. 7   
Protocol PHY1 903 09 Feb 2024 
 
C onf i de nt i a l    15 
18. Iris or pupil damage  
19. Posterior capsular rupture  
20. Vitreous loss  
21. Wound leak (positive Seidel)  
 
In addition to these risks associated with cataract surgery and IOLs in general, multifocal IOLs in 
particular have been associated with an increased risk of reduced contrast sensitivity and also 
dysphotopi[INVESTIGATOR_679430], potentially leading to secondary surgical interventions.  
 
2.3.2 POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
The possible benefits associated with this study are:  
• Improved vision at near, intermediate, and distance

from the study , followed under the Investigator’s normal standard of care.   
If a n operative adverse event prevent s implantation of the investigational IOL in the first eye and the IOL 
touched the eye, the Investigator should follow the subject through resolution of any adverse events 
(AEs) and then discontinue the subject. If an operative AE prevents implantation of the investigational 
IOL in the second operative eye, the Investigator should follow the subject through resolution of any AEs 
for the second operative eye and the subject should remain in the study and attend all study visits  for 
the first operative eye.

5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
Study participants will be recruited from the i nvestigator’s patient population, referrals, or other 
outreach methods .  Written recruitment materials directed to potential study participants must be 
approved by [CONTACT_265771].    
Where possible, candidate participants  may be pre-screened via review of their medical charts to 
evaluate potential eligibility based on study inclusion/exclusion criteria.  During the informed consent 
discussion, the potential participant’s willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements will be 
evaluated.  Those who elect to sign the study informed consent form ( ICF) will be considered enrolled in 
the study and given a study identification code.  At/after the time of enrollment, t he subject will be 
evaluated  at the Preoperative  Visit for study eligibility  based on inclusion/exclusion requirements .   
Study site personnel should take the following steps to minimize the likelihood of early termination 
during the study : 
• During the Preoperative  Visit, emphasize the importance of returning for all study follow -up 
visits and thoroughly evaluate the study subject for potential health or motivational issues or 
other life circumstances that may negatively affect compliance with the stu dy follow-up visit 
schedule.  
• Evaluate research staff flexibility to work around personal difficulties encountered by [CONTACT_679442] (e.g., appointment times).  
• Attempt to schedule subject follow -up visits early in the visit window to facilitate rescheduling 
within the window, if necessary.  
• Attempt to follow- up on subjects who do not return for scheduled examinations.

7  PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION / WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION / WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE S TUDY 
Discontinued subjects are those who withdraw from the study after  the study  informed consent 
document is signed and before the final visit is completed.  Subjects who sign the study consent  
document  but fail to meet eligibility criteria or withdraw prior to study IOL implantation in the first 
eye shall be considered discontinued due to screen failure.  
A subject may be discontinued prior to the final study visit for any of the following reasons, including but 
not limited to:  
• Screen failure  
• Adverse event(s); note that subjects  should be followed within the study until adverse event 
resolution or stability  
• Investigator’s request (e.g. medical decision)  
• Voluntary withdrawal (subject’s request)  
• Death 
• Study terminated by [CONTACT_2728]  
• Loss to follow -up 
Prior to discontinuing a subject, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_679447] a final 
study visit and obtain as much follow -up data as possible. Discontinued subjects should thereafter be 
followed outside of the study protocol according to the Investigator’s normal standard of care.  
The reason for participant discontinuation  or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the Exit  
Case Report Form ( CRF).  
 
Version 1. [ADDRESS_919246] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site will  attempt to contact [CONTACT_257677] , electronic , or regular mail to 
reschedule the missed visit . At least [ADDRESS_919247] be sent to the 
participant’s last known mailing address .  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up.] 
These actions will be recorded in the source documents and a copy of the certified follow -up letter 
maintained in the source documents . The date of discontinuation for subjects lost to follow -up will be [ADDRESS_919248] surgery/IOL implantation will be performed for the primary eye  and the subject will be 
scheduled to return for follow -up visits and examinations at the Day 1, Week 1, Month 1, Month 6, and 
Month 12  time periods, consistent with study visits  described in ISO [ZIP_CODE] -7 (Form 0 through Form 5).  
Cataract surgery/IOL implantation in the second operative  eye will be scheduled 7 – [ADDRESS_919249] returns for scheduled primary eye visits.   Data collected from each visit , 
including any abnormal findings,  will be documented in the source records and recorded on study 
eCRFs.   
The timing and frequency of assessments/procedures to be performed at each visit is outlined in  the 
SoA. 
Methodology for study examinations is presented in the Manual of Procedures .  
 
8.1 PREOPERATIVE VISIT (DAY -90 TO DAY -1):  VISIT [ADDRESS_919250] be obtained prior to performing study -specific procedures not part of the

Protocol PHY1 903 09 Feb 2024 
 
C onf i de nt i a l    27 
investigator’s routine standard of care .  Subjects who sign the ICF will be given a unique 4- digit screening 
number, where the first two digits corresponds to the site number .  
At this visit, the following activities will be performed :  
• Ocular and significant non- ocular medical history * 
• Projected  Visual Acuity * 
• UCDVA* 
• BCDVA* 
• Target Refraction/IOL power calculation/Axial Length/Anterior Chamber Depth (biometry) * 
• Keratometry * 
• Corneal Topography * 
• Manifest Refraction (ETDRS) * 
• Photopic/mesopic pupil size * 
• Intraocular Pressure * 
• Slit Lamp Exam * 
• Dilated Fundus Exam * 
* These assessments , if performed during routine standard of care exams  up to [ADDRESS_919251] be  performed  in the preoperative 
time period  (Day -90 to Day -1).  
For those determined to be eligible for  cataract surgery/IOL implantation , the eye with the worse 
BCDVA will be scheduled for surgery first. If BCDVA is the same for both eyes, the right eye will be 
implanted first.  The randomization assignment will be determined indicating which IOL will be used, 
and the subject’s surgery will be scheduled.  
 
8.2 OPERATIVE VISIT (DAY 0):  VISIT 00 A/B 
The Operative Visit for the first operative  eye must occur on Day 0.  The Operative Visit for  the second 
operative  eye must be scheduled between Days 7 – 30, inclusive.   
At the Operative Visit, p rior to surgery , subjects will be assessed to reconfirm eligibility  and any changes 
in concomitant medications or medical/ocular conditions will be recorded  on the appropriate CRF . If the 
subject is determined no longer to be eligible, he/she will be discontinued from the study  prior to 
cataract surgery  and considered a screen failure .   
If operative complications prevent  implantation of the investigational IOL  (see Section 5.3  – Reasons Not 
to Implant a Study IOL), a non-study IOL may be implanted instead .  Subjects who were not exposed to 
the study IOL will be exited from the study  and followed per  the investigator’s standard of care .  
No additional refractive procedures are to be performed during the operative procedure or throughout the postoperative study period.  
 
Version 1. [ADDRESS_919252] be targeted as closely as 
possible for emmetropia.   
Surgeons may use their personalized A
-constant for model SN60AT . 
For study visits designated A or B, ‘A’ represents the first eye implanted (Eye A), and ‘B’ represents the 
second eye implanted (Eye B).  Monocular assessments will be performed at 
Visits 00 A/B, 1 A/B, 2 A/B
, 
and 3 A/B 
for only 
Eye A
 or only 
Eye B
, respectively, unless binocular assessments are specified (See 
Schedule of Activities, Section 1.3).  At Visits 4 and 5, monocular assessments and binocular assessments 
will be completed for both eyes.  
 
8.3 POSTOPERATIVE VISITS:  VISIT 1 THRU VISIT 5  
Postoperative visits should be scheduled accor ding to the following visit window schedule:  
• Visit 1 A: [ADDRESS_919253] eye  
• Visit 1 B: 1 -2 days after surgery on the second eye  
 
• Visit 2 A: [ADDRESS_919254] eye  
• Visit 2 B: 7 -14 days after surgery on the second eye  
 
• Visit 3 A: [ADDRESS_919255] eye  
• Visit 3 B: 30 
-
60 days after surgery on the second eye  
 
• Visit 4: 150-[ADDRESS_919256]
 eye 
• Visit 5: 360-[ADDRESS_919257]’s condition .  Mandatory  assessments include :  
• Patient Reported Outcomes Questionnaires  
• Concomitant medication  
• Ocular and non -ocular medical history  
• Manifest refraction  
• BCDVA at 4 m (photopic) monocularly , binocularly  for each implanted eye  
• UCDVA at 4 m (photopic) monocularly , binocularly  for each implanted eye  
• Keratometry  
• Slit lamp exam  
• Posterior capsule assessment  
• IOL observations  
• IOL tilt and decentration grading 
• Intraocular pressure  
• IOL Axis Orientation (retroilluminated slit lamp photo) – selected sites only  
• Fundus exam with dilated pupil  
• Adverse events  
• Device deficiencies  
The Investigator may perform additional procedures for proper diagnosis and treatment of the subject 
according to SoA in Section 1.3. The Investigator must document this information in the subject’s source 
documents  and record it on the USV eCRF . 
If, during an Unscheduled Visit, the subject is discontinuing from the study, the Investigator must 
complete the Exit CRF . 
Visits intended to fulfill scheduled visit requirements that fall outside the designated scheduled visit window are not Unscheduled Visits. In these cases, the visit data will be collected and transcribed to the 
appropriate scheduled visit CRF and a protoc ol deviation should be reported, if applicable.  
 
 
Version 1. [ADDRESS_919258] within 30 days of the Preoperative Visit  and 
during the study will be entered in the Concomitant Medication CRF. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative 
medications may be administered per the Investigator’s standard of care  and documented in source 
documents only (not to be entered in CRFs) . A complete list of the Investigator’s standard regimen of 
these medications will be provided to the Sponsor or its designee and approved by [CONTACT_679448]. Medications known to interfere with visual performance, pupil dilation, 
or iris structure are prohibited for the duration of the study.  
 
8.6 SECONDARY SURGICAL INTERVENTION  (SSI) 
The study Investigator must make an assessment of the subject to determine if a secondary surgical 
intervention ( SSI) is needed.  This assessment should be based on the Investigator’s assessment of the 
subject’s clinical outcome, subjects feedback related to visual symptoms, and other reasons, such as observed retained lens fragments.  The Investigator ’s assessment of the need for SSI should be based on 
a thorough examination including diagnostic testing as appropriate .  Consideration of BCDVA, IOL 
stability and subjective complaints such as blurred vision or visual disturbances should be considered , 
with an assessment of the potential risks and benefits associated with the SSI.    
The Investigator must assess if an SSI is related to the optical properties of the IOL .  An SSI is considered 
related to the optical properties of the IOL if the SSI is due to subject intolerance of visual symptoms not 
adequately improved by [CONTACT_356807] . 
Situations requiring SSIs that are not considered related to the optical properties of the IOL include:  
• Posterior capsular opacification  (PCO; note that YAG for PCO is not considered an SSI  but an 
analysis of rates will be performed ) 
• Macular edema confirmed by [CONTACT_294138]/or fluorescein angiography  
• Corneal disorders (e.g., dry eye syndrome, edema, and corneal irregularities ) 
• Pre-existing or newly developed ocular pathologies , including those related to decentration, ti lt 
or rotation of the IOL requiring reoperation  
• Surgical complications noted at the operative visit that may reasonably be expected to affect postoperative outcomes  
Secondary IOL interventions should be categorized as IOL exchange  (the investigational device is 
replaced with the same lens model ), IOL removal (the investigational device is removed and replaced 
with a non -investigational lens or no lens is implanted ), IOL repositioning (the existing IOL is surgically 
moved to another location or rotated ), or other.  
 Indications for device exchange, removal, or 
repositioning will be recorded in the CRF.  
 
Version 1. [ADDRESS_919259]’s visual outcomes, the IOL should be replaced  with a new lens; however, the replacement 
IOL cannot be the  investigational IOL  model. 
In the case where the subject reports visual  disturbances in the early postoperative period, the surgeon 
should remind the subject that these symptoms generally improve over time due to neural adaptation.  Therefore, adequate time should be allowed for this neural adaptation to occur.  The Investigator should 
consult with the Medical Monitor and carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of the SSI .  
These should be discussed with the subject; if the subject is intolerant of persistent  visual disturbances  
and the Investigator identifies the IOL properties as being the primary cause  then lens replacement 
should be considered.

Relationship of the AE to Study Device or Surgical Procedure:  
Definite A clear-cut causal relationship  and no other possible cause 
Probable A causal relationship  is likely although alternate  etiologies  are 
also possible 
Possible A causal relationship  is not definite, alternate  etiologies  
are also possible 
Not Related  The AE has  no causal relationship  and/or there is evidence of 
alternative etiology such as concurrent  medication  or illness. 
 
8.7.[ADDRESS_919261]:  
• Observed or volunteered problems  
• Complaints  
• Physical signs and symptoms  
• The occurrence of a medical condition during the study, which was absent at baseline  
• The worsening of a baseline medical condition during the study 
Each subject eye must be examined for the presence/absence of adverse events at all visits, whether 
scheduled or not. If an AE  occurs, the first concern will be the safety and welfare of the subject; 
treatment should be provided as appropriate for the event.  
AEs, regardless of causal relationship, must be assessed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator and recorded in the subject’s 
CRF. AEs should be recorded in the form of a diagnosis, rather than signs and symptoms.  Each AE must 
be described as ocular or non- ocular along with the following information: date of onset, date of 
resolution, severity, nature of the event (intermittent, continuous), action taken (none, medical and/or surgical), relationship to study device  and surgical procedure , seriousness criteria and expectedness .    
Any medication or other intervention necessary for the treatment of an AE must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  If the same type of AE occurs multiple times, each event should be recorded separately.  
AEs will be documented beginning at the time of onset, and documentation must continue until recovery is noted.  Events that are ongoing at the time of study exit should be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
Ocular conditions or diseases noted during the Preoperative Visit that are chronic but stable and meet 
the inclusion/exclusions criteria should be recorded as Ocular History in the subject’s case report form .  
 
Version 1. [ADDRESS_919262] be reported to the 
Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee, within [ADDRESS_919263]’s eCRF .  Information provided on the eCRF should be 
supplemented with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78685], death certificate, clinic notes from specialists evaluating the 
subject’s condition, etc. as applicable for the event.  The urgency for reporting SAEs /UADEs is 3-fold:  
• To facilitate discussion [and implementation, if necessary] by [CONTACT_679451] -up measures;  
• To facilitate Investigator reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects to the IRB; and  
• To enable the Sponsor to fulfill the reporting requirements to the appropriate regulatory authority.  
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to promptly  notify the IRB of SAEs per the  IRBs reporting 
requirements. Investigators must report the occurrence of a UADE to their reviewing IRB as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_919264] surgery and/or premium IOL implantation that might 
reasonably be expected to occur in this study are listed below and include, but are not limited to, the 
following:

• Undesirable severe optical phenomena resulting in secondary surgical intervention  
 
Early, low grade anterior chamber cell/flare, corneal edema, and increase in IOP can often be considered 
normal or expected after IOL surgery.  They do not need to be reported as adverse events if they occur 
prior to 1 week postoperatively if they meet the following criteria:  
• Anterior chamber cells or flare of grade [ADDRESS_919266] 
postoperative medication regimen (if it persists to 1 week or more it should be reported as an 
adverse event);  
• Corneal edema of grade 2 or less that does not reduce acuity to 0.3 logMAR  (20/40) or worse 
and does not require any change in standard postoperative medication regiment (If it persists to 1 week or more it should be reported as an adverse event);  
• Increased IOP that is <10mm Hg above baseline or is < 25mmHg and requires no change in 
standard postoperative medications regiment or any other special treatment.  
 
However, note that all secondary surgical interventions (and events that cause these interventions) and 
all events that have sequelae should be reported as adverse events, regardless of when they occur. 
Note: Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is NOT to be reported as an AE, per ISO [ADDRESS_919267]’s case report form .

9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
As specified in ANSI Z80.12:2007 (R2017)  –C.4, a minimum of [ADDRESS_919274] be available for analysis at 
Visit 5 (postoperative days 330 -420). To consider the potential loss of subjects between the time of 
enrollment and study completion, a total of approximately 
5
01
 
subjects will be 
randomized and undergo 
surgery in this study. It is assumed that of approximately 501 subjects who undergo surgery , 51
 
subjects 
(10%) will be  discontinued prematurely or lost to follow-up. Subjects will be randomized to receive 
either the investigational or comparator IOL in a 2:1 ratio. Of 
5
01 subjects who undergo surgery , 
approximately 3 34 subjects will receive the investigational IOL and 1 67 subjects will receive the 
comparator IOL. Expecting a screen failure rate of 7%, up
 
to [ADDRESS_919275] 501 subjects randomized and scheduled for surgery.  
For effectiveness, 300 subjects ( 
first operative
 eyes) randomized to FINEVISION HP  IOL and 150 subjects 
(first operative  eyes) randomized to 
AcrySof SN60AT
 IOL completing through Month 6 (Visit 4)

(logMAR) at Month 6 (Visit  4), using a one -sided test with an 
alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_919276] deviation of 0. 10 logMAR, and a non -inferiority margin of 0.10 logMAR.  
Similarly with the sample size required for safety, 300 subjects ( first operative  eyes) randomized to 
FINEVISION HP  IOL and 150 subjects ( first operative  eyes) randomized to AcrySof SN60AT  IOL 
completing through Month 6 (Visit 4)  will have >99% power to demonstrate superiority of 
FINEVISION 
HP IOL to

favor of H 12e) using a two -sided test with an alpha level of 0.05 and assuming a true difference in means 
of -0.10 logMAR ( FINEVISION HP  minus AcrySof SN60AT
 with a common standard deviation of 
0.14 logMAR . 
For safety (based on ANSI Z80.12) [ADDRESS_919277] 
operative  eyes with AcrySof SN60AT  IOL completing through Month 12 (Visit 5 ) yields

FINEVISION HP  IOL and of the 
AcrySof SN60AT
 IOL is 0.001, and a non -inferiority margin of 
0.014 (1.4%). Similarly, ISO [ZIP_CODE] -7 specifies that a minimum of 300 subjects should complete a clinical 
evaluation of an IOL to obtain approp riate specificity around adverse event and visual acuity rates.

The unit of analysis in this study will be the 
first operative
 eye for all primary effectiveness and safety 
summaries and will be the second operative  eye and all eyes for supportive safety summaries ;  
 
 Both eyes of each 
subject will be treated during the study. For those subjects whose eyes are both determined to be 
eligible for cataract surgery/IOL implantations at Preoperative Visit 0,  the eye with the worse best

corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) will be scheduled for surgery first. If BCDVA is the same for 
both eyes, the right eye will be implanted first. Additionally, non -ocular
 
AEs and medical history will be 
presented at the subject level.  
 
9.4.2 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA  
Missing data for primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be imputed under the following strategies.  
Nonmonotone missing data will be multiply -imputed using treatment -based Markov Chain Monte Carlo  
(MCMC) methods; monotone missing data will be multiply imputed using regression methods assuming 
data as either missing at random or missing not at random as described below.  
Primary Strategy  
1. Withdrawal due to investigator’s request:  missing data assumed to be missing not at random. 
Control-based multiple imputations will be completed for superiority hypotheses and 
treatment

9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY EFFECTIVENESS  ENDPOINTS  
The statistical analyses described in ISO [ZIP_CODE] -7, ISO [ZIP_CODE] - 9, and ANSI Z80.12 will be performed unless 
otherwise specified in the statistical analysis plan.  
The co-primary effectiveness endpoints are:  
• Photopic monocular logMAR best corrected distance visual acuity ( BCDVA) in 
first operative
 
eyes at Month 6 ( Visit 4)  
• Photopic monocular logMAR distance corrected near visual acuity  (DCNVA) in 
first operative
 
eyes at Month 6 ( Visit 4)  
Primary effectiveness endpoint analyses will be based on the All
-
implanted Analysis Set
. Imputation of 
missing data will be performed utilizing multiple imputation techniques under assumptions of missing at 
random and missing not at random following the primary strategy presented in 
Section 9.4.[ADDRESS_919280] 
o
perative Month 6 (Visit 4)  will be primarily 
summarized using continuous summary statistics by [CONTACT_1570] . The treatment effect 
[
mean Test 
group IOL visual acuity (VA)  minus mean Control group IOL VA ] in logMAR  units will be presented in 
addition to a two -sided 90% t -distribution confidence interval around the difference. If the upper 
confidence limit is less than 0.1, then H 01e will be rejected in favor of H 11e and the FINEVISION HP  IOL will 
be considered to be statistically non -inferior to the AcrySof SN60AT  IOL in 
B
CDVA.
 
Photopic monocular DCNVA in 
first operative
 eyes at Post 
o
perative Month 6 (Visit 4)  will be summarized 
using continuous summary statistics in logMAR units by [CONTACT_2948]. The 
FINEVISION HP
 IOL will be 
compared to the AcrySof SN60AT  IOL using a two -sample t-test with a two-sided alpha  of 0.05. 
If the two-sided p-value < 0.05 in favor of 
 
FINEVISION HP  IOL for DCNVA, then the 
FINEVISION HP
 IOL 
will be considered to be  statistically superior to the 
AcrySof SN60AT
 IOL in 
DCNVA
.  
The study will be considered a success only if both primary effectiveness endpoints are met.  
 
9.4.4 ANALYSIS OF S ECONDARY EFFECTIVENE SS ENDPOIN TS

missing data and sensitivity analyses for the secondary 
effectiveness endpoint will be performed 
similarly as for the primary effectiveness endpoints.  
Photopic DCIVA (66 cm) in first operative  eyes at Post operative Month 6 (Visit 4) will be summarized 
using continuous summary statistics in logMAR units by [CONTACT_1570]. The FINEVISION HP IOL will be 
compared to the AcrySof SN60AT  IOL using a two -sample t-test with a two-sided alpha  of 0.05. 
If the 
two
-sided p-value < 0.[ADDRESS_919282] results to be statistically significant to declare success for the 
study. The overall Type I error rate including 
 
the primary and secondary effectiveness hypothesis tests 
will be controlled by a hierarchical testing strategy in which statistical inference for the secondary 
effectiveness endpoint will only be performed if the primary effectiveness analyses are success ful. 
 
9.4.6 SAFETY ANALYSES  
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Set, unless otherwise specified.  
Co-primary Safety Analyses  
The co-primary safety endpoints are:  
• Cumulative rate of SSIs related to the optical properties of the IOL 
in 
first operative  eyes through 
Month 12 (Visit 5)  
• Mean monocular distance contrast sensitivity (mesopic with and without glare at 1.5, 3, 6, and 
12 cpd measured at 2.5m, and photopic with and without glare at 3, 6, 12, and 18 cpd, 
measured at 2.5m)  in first operative eyes  at Month 12 (Visit 5)  
Descriptive statistics and analyses of co -primary safety variables will be based on 
first operative
 eyes 
and repeated as supportive analyses using second operative  eyes as well as all 
operative
 eyes. 
Secondary surgical interventions related to the optical properties of the IOL will be summarized  by 
[CONTACT_679452] . Noninferiority of 
FINEVISION HP
 IOL compared to AcrySof 
SN60AT
 
IOL in the proportions of first operative  eyes with secondary surgical interventions 
related to the optical properties of the IOL will be evaluated using two -sided 90% Farrington method 
confidence intervals around the difference in proportions between the 
FINEVISION HP
 IOL and 
AcrySof 
SN60AT  IOL. If the upper limit of the confidence interval is less than 0.014, then H 01s will be 
rejected in favor of H 11s and the FINEVISION HP IOL will be considered statistically non -inferior to the 

 
Version 1. [ADDRESS_919283] sensitivity (mesopic with and without glare at 1.5, 3, 6, and 
12 cpd measured at 2.5m , and photopic with and without glare at 3, 6, 12, and 18 cpd , measured at 
2.5m) in first operative eyes  based on the Best Case  Set will be summarized by [CONTACT_679453]. The treatment group difference (mean Test group contrast sensitivity minus mean 
Control group contrast sensitivity) in log units will be presented by [CONTACT_679454]. 
Additionally, for each testing condition and frequency, the 5th percentile for the control group log 
contrast sensitivity will be determined and the percentage of subjects in the investigational arm who 
have achieved a log contrast sensitivity lower than this  value will be reported.

[IP_ADDRESS] DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site 
Investigator. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported.  
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation 
of data.   
Data recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF) should be consistent with the data recorded on 
the source documents .  
Clinical data (including the measures as presented in Section 1.3 Schedule of Activities) will be entered 
into a [ADDRESS_919293] protection and internal 
quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or 
inaccurate.  Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.  
 
10.1.10 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol  requirements or  International 
Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP).  
Per ICH E3, Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports and ICH E3, Questions and Answers (R1), major protocol deviations are those that might significantly affect the completeness, accuracy, and/or 
reliability of study data or that might significantly affect a subject's rights, safety or well- being.  For 
example, major protocol deviations might include enrolling subjects in violation of key eligibility criteria 
designed to ensure a specific subject population, or failing to collect data necessary to interpret primary 
endpoints that may compromise the scientific value of the trial.  
The site investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to the  reviewing IRB requirements  
regarding reporting of protocol deviations. Further details about the handling of protocol deviations will 
be included in the  Statistical Analysis Plan .

 4 Background and Rationale (including feasibility) 
 
Paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, is associated with several well-known side effects 
including neuropathy and generalized body aches (1).  The latter has recently been described as 
paclitaxel- associated acute pain syndrome (P-APS) and often occurs in the 1st 3-4 days after 
admi
nistration (2).  It affects about 58-90% of patients (2, 10).  Previously, these symptoms have been 
described as myalgias and arthralgias (1).  However, recent data support that P-APS may in fact be an 
early manifestation of neuropathy, as opposed to being musculoskeletal in origin. For instance, it was 
noted that patients with higher P-APS pain scores with the first dose of paclitaxel are at risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_559960] (2, 3). 
 P-APS can be severe, and may require use of potent analgesics for symptom control.  Non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used as frontline therapy. However, there is concern over 
side effects including gastrointestinal bleeding and acute renal injury.  Many therapi[INVESTIGATOR_559961] (4), glutamine (5), antihistamine (6), opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], and herbs (7), with variable 
results. 
Low dose oral prednisone starting 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy and continued for a total of 
5 days has been previously reported to result in substantial improvement in symptomatology (3). 
However, this study was limited due to the small sample size.  In addition, given the variable schedule of 
paclitaxel ranging from weekly to every [ADDRESS_736044] on the 
development and severity of symptoms, as reported by [CONTACT_559973] (5).  
Oral low-dose antihistamine, in the form of terfenadine 60 mg at the onset of pain and subsequently, has 
been reported to be temporarily effective in controlling paclitaxel-induced myalgia and /or dysesthesia 
(5). However, this study was also limited by [CONTACT_559974] [ADDRESS_736045] significant 
clinical utility.  
 
Data on the Pathophysiology of Paclitaxel-Associated Acute Pain Syndrome  
The mechanism of P-APS is currently unknown.  For many years, these subacute aches and pains were 
described as myalgias/ arthralgias based on patient reported symptoms.  The self-limited course led to a 
hypothesis that symptoms are possibly the result of an inflammatory reaction to paclitaxel (1,3).  More 
recently, Loprinzi et al reported the natural history of P-APS (2,3). In this study, P-APS symptoms were 
assessed in 94 patients using patients’ daily symptom log with 10 items assessing pain symptoms and 
used of pain medication, adapted from Cleeland’s Brief Pain Inventory (Appendix I).  In addition, a 22-
item summary questionnaire regarding symptom characteristics was given after paclitaxel use.  
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms were assessed using the validated 
EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(QLQ)-CIPN-[ADDRESS_736046] be an early manifestation of neuropathy and is 
associated with the development of chronic neuropathy (2, 3). 
One mechanism proposed for P-APS is an early inflammatory process characterized by [CONTACT_559975] (9).  
Morphologic alterations in DRG satellite cells have been noted and upregulation of proinflammatory 
cytokines have been hypothesized as early events in the development of neuropathy (9). Therefore, it is 
possible that paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain may be mediated by [CONTACT_303886]. If P-
APS and chronic neuropathy are indeed part of a continuum, the inflammatory pathway would be a 
reasonable target for therapy.   
The exact mechanism on how paclitaxel eventually leads to the development of neuropathy is still not 
understood.  Taxanes promote stabilization of microtubules leading to disruption of normal cell division, 
and eventually resulting in cell death.  Results of a study showed that short-term administration of 
paclitaxel induces mainly reversible changes in the peripheral nerves and spi[INVESTIGATOR_418847] (8). Microtubules 
seem to be the main target of paclitaxel neurotoxicity, in much the same way as has been described for its 
antineoplastic activity. It has been hypothesized that microtubule-dependent axonal transport is disrupted 
by [CONTACT_114461]. Abnormal aggregation of microtubules in neuronal cells is hypothesized to contribute to 
neurosensory abnormalities leading to impairment of axonal transport (8).  
Taken together, an intervention with both anti-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective properties would 
be an ideal candidate for testing in the prevention of P-APS and subsequent development of peripheral 
neuropathy. 
 
Rationale for Studying Omega 3 Fatty Acids to Prevent or Ameliorate  P-APS 
Omega 3 Fatty Acids:  Anti-Inflammatory Properties and P-APS.  
Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have two major families, the omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 
(n-3).  The 20 carbon (n-3) and (n-6) fatty acids compete for the same enzymes and therefore, the intake 
of one omega fatty acid will diminish the metabolism of the other (10,15).   
Arachidonic Acid (AA) is a primarily diet-derived 20 carbon omega-6 PUFA which serves as a precursor 
of proinflammatory metabolites such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes (10). These 
eicosanoids are involved in modulating the intensity and duration of an inflammatory response. 
Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes are the rate limiting enzymes in the conversion of AA to prostaglandin 
E2 (PGE2) and are a target for therapy, of which the most widely studied are the NSAIDS. 
Long chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)  and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are 
common dietary supplements. They have well established anti-inflammatory properties which serve as the 
basis for their use in therapeutic trials in inflammatory conditions (10, 11).  
EPA competes with AA for enzymatic metabolism, thereby [CONTACT_559976].   
Recently, omega-[ADDRESS_736047] also been identified as precursors of anti-inflammatory mediators called 
protectins and resolvins.  Resolvins occur in the resolution phase of inflammation.  Protectin D1 was 
. 
 6 initially found to decrease damage of brain ischemia-reperfusion injury and thus named neuroprotectin 
D1 (12-14). 
Sever
al clinical studies have reported the pain relieving effects of omega 3 fatty acids for inflammatory 
joint diseases.  In a recent meta-analysis of 17 trials, supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids for 3-4 
months resulted in reduction in patient reported pain severity, duration of morning stiffness and amount 
of NSAID consumption (11).  
As noted above, there is evidence that early inflammatory processes are observed in paclitaxel induced 
nerve damage. This may in part account for the symptoms of P-APS, and sustained inflammation may 
lead to downstream effects responsible for evolution of peripheral neuropathy (8, 9).  Omega-3 fatty acids 
consumption can attenuate the production of pro-inflammatory metabolites.  In addition, it can generate 
local mediators that facilitate resolution of inflammation (12-14).  Thus, if P-APS is indeed mediated by 
[CONTACT_2898], the anti-inflammatory activity of omega-3 fatty acids may be one mechanism to prevent P-
APS.  Additionally, given its well established safety profile, it may be an attractive alternative to 
NSAIDS. 
 
Omega 3 Fatty Acids:  A Dietary Supplement with Neuroprotective Properties 
The nervous system is richly endowed with omega-[ADDRESS_736048] 
reported the role of omega-3 fatty acids in maintaining nerve integrity and function (16, 21). Long chain n-
3 PUFAs such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been shown to have promising in the treatment of a 
broad range of neurodegenerative conditions (16).   
Several preclinical models have shown the neuroprotective effect of DHA in models of spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] 
(17- 19).  A mouse model has recently been used comparing groups with different fatty acid profiles (19).  
One group expressed the fat-1 gene  from Caenorhabditis elegans, which encodes a fatty acid desaturase, 
the enzyme that converts n-6 into n-3 PUFAs, leading to enrichment in tissue n-3 PUFA levels (low n-6/n-
3 ratio). This was compared to the group that had a high n-6/ n-3 ratio as well as to wild type strain.  Utilizing 
in vitro and in vivo injury models, neurite growth, axonal regeneration, sensory and motor function were 
assessed and compared. Interestingly, the dorsal root ganglion neurons from fat-1 mice ( n-3 enriched) had 
significant increase in neurite outgrowth and improved neuronal survival after injury. The omega- [ADDRESS_736049] been studied in a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative 
disorders (21- 24).  Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, has been reported to 
strongly correlate with decreases in omega -3 fatty acid levels in the brain and peripheral tissue compared 
to age-related controls (22).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_559962] a correlation between lower levels 
of dietary omega-3 fatty acids and the development of Alzheimer’s disease (23), suggesting a 
. 
 [ADDRESS_736050] been seen in Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative 
disorder of the basal ganglia (24).  Dietary interventions however have shown conflicting results. 
There are also emerging data on the role of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in acute neurologic injuries. 
As an example, it was reported that administration of moderate to high dose human albumin rich in DHA 
is neuroprotective in focal brain ischemia (25).   
These observations lend credence to the notion that omega-[ADDRESS_736051] investigated the potential synergy with the 
combination treatment (26-28).  In early preclinical data, sequential exposure to Omega-3 PUFA 
docosahexanoic acid (DHA) followed by [CONTACT_559977]- MB-231 (26). The investigational drug 
Taxoprexin  (DHA-Paclitaxel), a 2’-O-acyl conjugate of paclitaxel covalently bound to DHA via an ester 
bond, was developed to improve paclitaxel’s therapeutic performance.  Phase I trials did not show any dose 
limiting toxicities with the conjugated preparation (27).  Oral omega-[ADDRESS_736052] several commercial preparations available for over the counter use. To date, there are no 
reported adverse drug reactions with FDA approved Lovaza and paclitaxel. 
 
Feasibility 
P-APS is common and occurs in about 50-90% of patients.  Paclitaxel is a common chemotherapeutic 
agent used in a variety of malignancies, both in the early and advanced setting.  Therefore, it is expected 
that the many patients will be eligible for this clinical trial. 
Omega-[ADDRESS_736053] profile make 
them an attractive alternative to NSAIDS.  Furthermore, its potential neuroprotective properties make 
them an intriguing candidate for testing in paclitaxel induced neuropathy.

Exclusion Criteria 
1. Known allergy to omega-[ADDRESS_736057] 6 months 
 
Protocol Treatment: 
Treatment:   Omega-3 Fatty Acid: 4 capsules (1 gram/capsule) or a double-blinded placebo either once 
daily or [ADDRESS_736058] (maximum of 12 weeks).  
Rationale for dosing :  A dose of at least 2.7 g/day of EPA and DHA have been reported to have 
analgesic effects in inflammatory conditions (11). The dose of 4 g/day is an FDA approved dose of 
omega-3 fatty acids (Lovaza) for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and has a well-documented 
toxicity profile. On the basis of this, a dose of 4 g/day was selected. 
Formulation of omega-3-fatty acid:   Lovaza (omega-3-acid ethyl esters) capsules  will be used .  Each 1-
gram capsule of Lovaza contains approximately 465 mg EPA and 375 mg DHA.  
Formulation of placebo:   Placebo will be provided by [CONTACT_559981].  Excipi[INVESTIGATOR_559964]. It will be odorless like Lovaza. Since the 
placebo may slightly differ from Lovaza, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_559965].  In addition, to document blinding, the patients will be asked on cycle 1 Day 
2, if they know what medication they are receiving.  
Randomization:   Clinical Encapsulation Services or UNM Pharmacy will package both placebo and 
active drugs.  Our pharmacy will take care of randomization.  Then our research nurses will dispense the 
drug. 
 
Measurement tools:    
For P-APS symptoms , there will be 4 types of questionnaires, adapted from NCCTG N08C1: (1) a 
baseline/pretreatment questionnaire.  (2) a daily paclitaxel induced acute pain syndrome symptom log from 
Day 2-7 (2, 20).  (3) day 8 P-APS symptom summary.  (4) 1 month after completion of paclitaxel 
questionnaire. 
. 
 10 For chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN ) neurotoxicity , the EORTC-QLQ CIPN20 
patient questionnaire will be used.  The questionnaire will be filled out on the 8th day of each chemotherapy 
treatment and 1 month after completion of therapy.  
Dietary counseling :  As omega-3 fatty acid metabolism is affected negatively by [CONTACT_559982], dietary counseling will be provided to assess the fatty acid intake.   Omega-3 and Omega- 6 
Fatty Acid Dietary Intake Questionnaire will be given at baseline, Week 2, Week 4 and monthly thereafter 
(prepared by [CONTACT_559983], PhD). 
Laboratory tests :  Due to a small risk of increased LDL and transaminase levels, LDL and transaminase 
levels will be determined at baseline, at Week [ADDRESS_736059] day of paclitaxel treatment. 
 
D. Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0.  Adverse events will be assessed to determine 
tolerability as part of the secondary objectives of the study.  Analyses will be performed for all patients 
having received at least one dose of omega-3 (Lovaza).  Recording of AEs and their attribution (whether 
they are due to omega-[ADDRESS_736060] of care chemotherapy treatment (paclitaxel) is important to 
determining the tolerability of omega-3.  Since this study focuses on determining whether omega-3 can 
prevent P-APS and/or peripheral neuropathy as well as the tolerability of omega-3 in patients undergoing 
treatment with paclitaxel, the scope of AE collection will be limited to: 
1) Any AEs involving aches or pain 
2) Any AEs involving neuropathy 
3) Any AEs that are definitely, probably, or possibly related to omega-3/placebo or paclitaxel 
In addition to recording AEs, data will be captured on whether AEs attributed to omega-[ADDRESS_736061] 
3% or greater rate than placebo in prior clinical trials using Lovaza are as follows: 
(1) Eructation (belching) which occurs in about 4%  
(2) Dyspepsia occurring in about 3%  
(3) Altered taste in about 4% 
(4) As Lovaza contains omega-3 fatty acids obtained from several fish sources, patients with known 
hypersensitivity or allergy to fish/shellfish are excluded. However, a person who develops a rash on the 
1st week of Lovaza treatment, prior to paclitaxel administration, should be evaluated for Lovaza allergy. 
The rash should be graded per NCI-CTAE version 4 criteria and be recorded as a possible Lovaza allergy. 
 
Paclitaxel Side Effects:   These should be reported per NCI-CTAE version 4.  Dose modification of 
paclitaxel will be at the discretion of the treating physician. 
Side effects of paclitaxel include:  
. 
 11 1) neutropenia,  
2) transaminitis,  
3) neuropathy,  
4) hypersensitivity reactions,  
5) alopecia,  
6) arthralgias  
7) myalgias.  
Patients who discontinue paclitaxel treatment due to allergy to paclitaxel will not be evaluable. 
 
E. Data Analysis 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the effect of omega-3 on severity of paclitaxel associated pain syndrome will be evaluated 
in 60 patients using 1:1 randomization into omega-3 plus paclitaxel group and placebo plus paclitaxel group 
to achieve the primary aim. The primary endpoint will be determined by [CONTACT_559984] N08C1 pain inventory.  
Mean severity will be calculated for each group and differences between groups will analyzed via t-tests or 
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests as appropriate.  We will also consider a binary variable for incidence (no pain 
versus any pain, no relief versus any relief, does not interfere versus other) to evaluate the primary aim.  A 
formal sample size justification based on statistical hypothesis is not applicable to this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 
Considering 60%-80% incidence of paclitaxel associated pain syndrome, we can detect a minimal 
difference of 37.6%-37.9% pain syndrome difference base on 5% significance level and 80% power with 
our proposed sample size. In this effect size calculation, the significance level actually achieved by [CONTACT_254520] 2.2%-2.6%. Our sample size justification is based on primary aim with a binary variable of 
incidence. 
Similarly, we will consider both continuous variables and binary incidence variable for the secondary aims.  
For continuous variables, t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests will be used. Fisher’s exact test will be used 
for the incidence variable with 95% confidence intervals. 
Patients will be evaluable regardless of the number of cycles of paclitaxel completed.  A patient will be 
considered evaluable if they have completed a baseline pre-paclitaxel questionnaire and at least one 
questionnaire during paclitaxel treatment. 
The study will last for approximately 5 years including data analysis. 
 
F. Data Safety Monitoring: 
Data Safety Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_559985].

associated acute pain syndrome (P-APS) and development of peripheral neuropathy in cancer patients.  This will be a 
multi-institutional study conducted by [CONTACT_559998][INVESTIGATOR_559971] (NMCCA), a nonprofit corporation with approximately [ADDRESS_736093] been accrued. 
This feasibility trial will provide an opportunity for three investigators from the legacy groups to collaborate:  Zoneddy 
Dayao, MD (NCCTG) , Debra Barton, RN, PhD (NCCTG) and Melanie Royce, MD, PhD ( ACOSOG). This also provides an 
opportunity for mentoring a junior faculty in the conduct of symptom intervention trial.  If the results are positive, a 
definitive ALLIANCE Phase III trial will be conducted.  The legacy group NCCTG, now ALLIANCE have conducted and 
published the largest body of evidence in P-APS and CIPN.  Well established methodologies as well as correlative studies 
from the NCCTG experience will be used to further enhance the design of the Phase III trial. Given the straightforward 
intervention schema and the high incidence of P-APS, rapid accrual to this trial is anticipated. 
 
Other support for this project:  Currently none.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Chlorhexidine [CHD; 1,1’ -hexamethylenebis[5 -(4-chlorophenyl)  biguanide]] has a wide 
spectrum of bactericidal  and antiviral activity and is a common ingredient in  various 
formulations ranging from skin disinfectants in  healthcare products to antiplaque agen ts in 
dentistry . The presence of two symmetrically  positioned basic  chlorophenyl guanide groups 
attached to a lipophilic  hexamethylene chain aid in rapid absorption  through the outer 
bacterial cell wall, causing irreversible  bacterial membrane injury, cytoplasmic leakage, and  
enzyme inhibition . Chlo rhexid ine exists as various forms of salts: diacetate,  dihydrochloride, 
or digluconate, mainly differing by [CONTACT_911005]. 
Chlorhexidine  digluconate  (or gluconate), as most soluble in water or alcohol,  is the most 
used for m in topi[INVESTIGATOR_910990].1,[ADDRESS_1279764] skin3 no systemic adverse 
events are expected. However, skin reaction could occur . 
ReadyPrep® CHG is composed of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) solution on a single 
fiber, polyester cloth. Each cloth contains 500 mg CHG.  The sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_910991]® CHG (2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate Cloth) for patient preoperative skin 
preparation.  
In order to better understand and control for the pres ence of chlorhexidine in the 
environment, baseline levels will be assessed in each study period and a control treatment 
arm will be included.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1. DEFINITIONS  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
administered an investigational product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An AE can th erefore be any unfavorable a nd 
unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, for 
example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to the investigationa l product.  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibility’ 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and th e 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
An adverse event may be:  
 A new illness  
 Worsening of a co ncomitant illness  
 An effect of  the study medication including comparator; it could be an abnormal 
laboratory value as well as a significant shift from baseline within normal range 
which the Medical Investigator considers to be clinically important  
Abnormalities in laboratory tests, in the measurements of vital signs, in visual skin 
evaluation  or in other measurements performed after drug a pplication  or at the end of 
the study are to be recorded as adverse events only if they are medically relevant: 
symptomatic, requiring corrective trea tment, leading to study discontinuation and/or 
fulfilling a seriousness criterion. If asymptomatic, but with a suspected underlying 
process, the Medical Investigator may consider the abnormalities to be medically 
relevant.  
Surgical procedures themselves ar e not adverse events. They are therapeutic measures 
for conditions that required surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is 
an adverse event, if it occurs or is detected during the study period. Planned surgical 
measures permitted by [CONTACT_941] c linical study protocol and the conditions(s) leading to 
these measures are not adverse events, if the condition(s) was (were) known before the 
start of study treatment. In the latter case, the condition should be reported as medical 
history.  
A serious adve rse event (SAE) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at

7.2. SEVERITY  ASSES SMENT  
All adverse  events will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe according to the 
following definitions:  
Mild :  Causing no limitation of usual activities; th e subject may experience slight 
discomfort.  
Moderate : Causing some limitation of usual activities; the subject may experience 
annoying discomfort.  
Severe : Causing inability to carry out usual activities; the subject may experience 
intolerable discomfort or  pain.  
Every effort will be made to obtain an adequate evaluation of the severity.

TERM  DEFINITION  
Reasonable 
Possibility  A temporal relationship exists between the AE onset and 
administration of the  investigational product that cannot be readily 
explained by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Furthermore, the AE appears wi th some degree of  certainty to be 
related, based on the known therapeutic and pharmacologic actions or  
adverse event profile of the investigational product.  
In case of cessation or  reduction of the dose the AE may abate or 
resolve and it may reappear upon rechallenge.  
No Reasonable 
Possibility  Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the 
investigational  product.  
For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (eg, pre -existing  
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness , or concomitant 
medication).  
7.4. DOCUMENTATION AND RE PORTING OF ADVERSE E VENT S 
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation of adverse  events extends 
from the pre-trial evaluation  until the end  of the study. From screening to the first dose 
of the study, they will be recorded as screening events or as part of the medical 
history, as applicable. When AEs occur after initiation of study medication, they will 
be indicated as treatment -emergent AEs in the clinical study report. During the study , 
all adverse  events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423], observed by [CONTACT_911022] . 
If necessary, every effort will be made to obtain an adequate follow -up of th e subjects . 
Should any subject  choose to withdraw early from the study, they will be advised of 
the safety precautions to be taken.  
Subjects will be questioned on their health status at the beginning of each study period 
and before each departure from the clinical site. Open-ended question s will be asked.  
Classification will be performed by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term 
(PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 19.0 
or higher.

24 hours after becoming aware of its occurrence . This notification  will contain a 
description of the observed symptoms and an assessment of causality.  A detailed 
report will be sent in the following days.  
The notification, in English, should be directed to the following sponsor 
representative:

A SAE will be considered as "unexpected" when the nature or severity is not 
consistent with information in the relevant sour ce document(s) .  
Algorithme Pharma will determine whether any serious unexpected related adverse 
event must be reported to the IRB. If so, the event will be reported via fax or email 
within [ADDRESS_1279790] also notify the Clinical Safety Coordinator in CDER’s Office of 
Generic Drugs as soon as possible but in no case later than [ADDRESS_1279791] in the study shall be re ported to the sponsor within 
24 hours of the knowledge of its occurrence by [CONTACT_977]  (for pregnancies 
occurring during the course of the stu dy or immediately following the end of the 
study).  Because of the possibility that the fetus/embryo could have been exposed to 
the study drug through the parent and for the subject’s safety, the pregnancy will be 
followed up to determine its outcome, inclu ding spontaneous or voluntary termination, 
details of birth, presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies, or 
maternal and/or newborn complications.

last sample is collected).  
Where possible, all samples from each subject  will be analyzed on the same 
standard curve. Quality control samples will be distributed through each batch of 
study samples  assayed. Samples with drug concentrations greater than the upper 
limit of quantification (ULQ) of the assay range will be diluted with the 
appropriate drug -free biological fluid and re -assayed; those which are below the 
lower limit of this range will be r eported as being below limit of quantitation 
concentrations (BLQ) . The analysts will not have access to the randomization 
scheme.  
8.1.2.  Aberrant values and retested samples  
Unacceptable values attributable to bioanalytical reasons will be determined by 
[CONTACT_911023]. Such re -assayed samples will be termed “repeats”. All 
cases of re -assay will be reported in the final report.  
No samples will be repeated for p harmacokinetic re asons .

10% of the total analyzable study sam ples will be selected and re -assayed. The 
replicate measurement is not to be averaged with the original one , but both values 
will be presented in the bioanalytical report  with the initial value being used for 
PK calculations. The concentrations of the original and replicate samples will be 
tabulated , along with the percent difference between the two values . 
 
8.2. SAFETY  DATA  
The safety population will include all subjects who r eceived at least one treatment  
under study.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize adverse events, safety results and 
demographic variables (age, height, weight and BMI).  
The laboratory tests and t he measurements of vital signs, visual skin evalu ation  and 
other safety parameters performed after treatment  are mainly performed for safety 
reasons, and changes  may occur without any clinical symptoms. Therefore, any 
significant changes will be recorded as adverse events only if they are judged 
clinical ly significant by [CONTACT_551811] . 
The laboratory tests will be carried out according to the standard operating  procedures 
of the  licensed  medical laboratory. Abnormal results will be verified to rule out 
laboratory error. Persistent relevant abno rmal values should be followed up until the 
cause is determined or until the values  return to the pre -medication value.  
9. PHARMACOKINETICS AND  STATISTICS  
9.1. SUBJECTS  TO ANALYZE  
Samples from all subjects who received at least one treatment  and for whom sufficien t 
number of blood samples was taken for pharmacokinetic analysis will be assayed  and 
included in the pharmacokinetic analysis .  
Subjects who do not complete the sampling schedule of one or more study periods 
may be included in the pharmacokinetic analysis for only the PK parameters that are 
judged not to be affected by [CONTACT_911024](s). This decision is to be documented 
by [CONTACT_911025].

9.2. PHARMACOKINET IC ANALYSIS  
No or negligible plasma levels of chlorhexidine are expected following a single topi[INVESTIGATOR_910988]® CHG. Chlorhexidine p lasma concentrations produced by 
[CONTACT_911026] p rofile  of 
the drug product . Below limit of quantitation concentrations (coded BLQ) will be 
treated as zero for all statistical analyses. In the event that chlorhexidine levels are 
measurable,  the pharmacokinetic parameters that will be derived from the pla sma 
concentrations versus  time profiles are listed in  Table 3. All reported sampling time 
deviations (see Section  6.2.1 ) will be taken into consideration for evaluation of PK 
parameters.  
In the case where c oncentrations of chlorhexidine  cannot  be determined due to 
bioanalytical or clinical reasons, these values will be set to missing for the 
pharmacokinetic analysis.  
In the case where less than [ADDRESS_1279794] of the following:  
 Baseline concentrations will be measured approximately 1 0.00, 2.00 and 
0.50 hours prior to each treatment . The mean of these 3 pre -dose 
concentrations will be used for baseline adjustment.  
 Concentrations post -dose will be adjusted for each subject during each period 
by [CONTACT_911027]. Baseline 
adjustment will therefore be subject - and period - specific.  
If subtraction leads to values of adjusted profile that would be below the LOQ, these 
values will be reported without any change and they will not be reported as BLQ. 
However, if a ne gative plasma  concentration value results after baseline adjustment, 
this value will be set to 0 prior to calculating the baseline -adjusted AUC.  
For baseline adjusted calculations, concentrations at time T= -0.50 h will be set to zero 
given that no concen tration provided by [CONTACT_911028]. Unadjusted baseline PK estimation will use the observed 
concentration value at time T= -0.50 h.

Version 2.2, 2017/07/[ADDRESS_1279795] for this study will be C max, AUC 0-T 
and AUC 0-∞. Other parameters such as T max, AUC 0-T/∞, λZ and Thalf will be provided  
for information purposes only.  
The main absorption and disposition parameters will be estimated using a 
non-compartmental approach with a log -linear terminal phase assumption. The 
trapezoidal rule will be used to estimate the area under the curve (linear trapezoidal 
linear interpolation) and the terminal phase will be estimated by [CONTACT_911029] -linear regression model. However, 
AUC0-∞, AUC 0-T/∞, λ Z and T half parameters will be estimated for individual 
concentration -time profiles only when the terminal log -linear phase can be reliably 
characterized using the following criteria:  
 Phoenix® WinNonlin® Best fit range selection  
 R2 of at le ast 80%  
 The corresponding terminal half -life value must be lower than or equal 
to 2 times the time interval over which λ Z was estimated (i.e. T half ≤ twice the 
time interval difference between T LQC and T LIN). 
Descriptive statistics  will be calculated for plasma concentrations  at each individual 
time point and for all pharmacokinetic parameters.  The individual plasma 
concentration/time profiles will be presented using the actual sampling times where as 
the mean plasma concentration/time profiles will be pres ented using the theoretical 
sampling times . 
Pharmacokinetic ana lyses will be generated using validated  pharmacokinetic software  
(i.e. Phoenix® WinNonlin® version 6.3  or higher , Phoenix® ConnectTM version  1.3.1 or 
higher).  
9.3. STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  
No statistica l analysis will be performed.  
9.4. SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFIC ATION  
The objective of this study is to demonstrate that no or negligible systemic exposure 
occurs after a single topi[INVESTIGATOR_910987]® CHG.  Based on the sponsor’s 
data, it is estimated that 12 subjects should be sufficient to meet this objective .

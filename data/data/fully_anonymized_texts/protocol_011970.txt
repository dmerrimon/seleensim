INTRODUCTION 
 
We are asking for your permission for your child (and up to about 200 other subjects) to be in a 
research study so that we can learn new information that may help others. If you decide not to give 
your permission for your child to be in this study, we will still take good care of him/her.  If you decide 
to allow your child to be in this study, you may change your mind at any time during the study and 
your child can stop being in the study.  Take all the time you need to make your choice.  Ask us any 
questions you have. It is also okay to ask more questions after you decide to allow your child to be in 
the study.  You can ask questions at any time.   
 
 
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS RESEARCH? 
 
In this research study we want to learn more about a new device, presently called the “Q collar (see 
Figure below), which may help prevent concussions.  The neck collar device is made of soft fabric, 
plastic, and silicone, over a gentle embedded metal “spring” that is fitted around the neck providing 
comfortable compression to two of the veins on the side of the 
neck.  We are testing the theory that this mild compression will 
help prevent concussions by [CONTACT_3382]-filling the empty space around 
the brain with some blood and thereby [CONTACT_312627] “bubble wrap” 
around it.  It has been suggested that many “head banging 
animals” may be using a similar protection in the wild. 
 
In addition we wish to learn more about how the brain responds 
to concussive impacts during sport.   
 
We are asking your child and other children that play contact [CONTACT_759731], 
because we want to learn more about how well the device works in preventing concussions. We have 
successfully completed a very similar study in ice hockey athletes.

WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE RESEARCH?  
 
Greg Myer, PhD is the researcher at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349] (CCHMC) that is 
in charge of this study.   
 
CCHMC is being paid by Q30 Labs, LLC to do this study. 
 
 
WHO SHOULD NOT BE IN THE STUDY 
 
Your child cannot be in this study if he/she has any of the following: 
 History of neurological deficits or  severe head trauma 
 Known increased intracerebral pressure, metabolic acidosis or alkalosis 
 Any known increased pressure in eyes  
 any known increased fluid on the brain 
 Recent penetrating brain trauma (within 6 months) known increased pressure in the brain 
 Any known blood clots to the brain 
 Any known airway obstruction 
 
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE STUDY? 
 
The research staff will explain each visit to you and may give you a handout that explains each visit in 
more detail.  You will be able to ask questions to make sure that you understand what will happen to 
your child.  We will also ask parents/guardians of study participants to complete a brief behavioral 
rating scale that assesses indications of ADHD. We will send you a link via email to complete this 
questionnaire via a REDCap online survey.  This questionnaire will take you no longer than 5-10 
minutes to complete. 
 
If your child qualifies and you decide you want your child to be in the study, your child will come to 
CCHMC 4 times over the next 6 months.   If your child is diagnosed with a concussion during the 
sports season, your child may be asked to come to CCHMC for an additional study visit.  Each study 
visit will be split into 2 sessions and each session will take up to 2 hours to complete.   
 
Pre-season study visit (2 sessions) 
Post-season study visit (2 sessions) 
Follow up study visits – completed within 48-[ADDRESS_1040248] do not find this uncomfortable, the pressure on your child’s neck will feel like wearing a necktie.  
The neck collar device is made of plastic, silicone, metal and fabric that is fitted to the neck providing 
comfortable pressure around the neck.  The neck collar device will fit in the collar of an athletic 
compression shirt (that will be provided to you).  Studies have shown that there is no significant

4/11/[ADDRESS_1040249] to the brain (even with 
prolonged similar physiology of wearing a tight necktie) and therefore the risk of wearing this device is 
low.  It has also been tested during high intensity exercise and has shown no effect on performance, 
and has been deemed safe.   
 
This device is ONLY to be used during the football team games and practices. This device will NOT 
go home with the athlete.     
 
These are the things that will happen to your child while in the study: 
1. Neck Circumference, Height, Weight, and Body Fat % Measurements: We will measure the 
circumference of your child’s neck with a measuring tape. We will also measure your child’s 
height, weight, and body fat percentage using a standard measuring stick for height and a 
scale for weight and body fat percentage. This will be completed once at pre-season and once 
at post-season. 
2. IMPACT (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) Test:   This test will 
be administered on a computer and will assess your child’s verbal and visual memory, 
processing speed and reaction time.  This test will be completed at pre-season and  at post-
season.  
3. Reaction Time Testing on a Smart Phone:  Using a smart phone, your child will place his/her 
fingers on a smart phone touch screen and be asked to respond to a change in background 
color or the sound of a tone by [CONTACT_759732].  Your child may also be asked to tap his/her 
fingers on the screen when he/she hears a beep. This test will be completed at pre-season, and 
at post-season. 
4. Eye Tracking:  For this test, your child will wear a large pair of eye glasses that noninvasively 
track the movements of his/her eyes.  While wearing the glasses, your child will be asked to 
follow a moving object with his/her eyes on a computer screen. This test will be completed at 
pre-season and at post-season. 
5. EEG testing:  An EEG (electroencephalogram)  is a test that detects electrical activity in your 
child’s brain using small, flat discs (electrodes) attached to cap (like a shower cap) that he/she 
will wear on his/her head. Your child’s brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are 
active all the time, even when they're asleep. This activity shows up as wavy lines on an EEG 
recording. This portion will involve three different tests.  The first two tests involve listening to 
some different sounds and pressing a button when your child hears the target sound.  The third 
test will just involve sitting quietly with his/her eyes open and then again with them closed.  
While your child is performing these tasks, he/she will be wearing a cap over their head that has 
electrodes which measure the activity in the brain.  Your child will not feel anything during this 
test.  
6. MRI Imaging:  Your child will be asked to lie down in a machine that will take images of his/her 
brain. For part of this test, your child may be asked to lay still.  For other parts of this test, your 
child may be asked to answer questions that will assess his/her thinking and memory.  This test 
will be completed at the pre-season and post-season time points during a separate session 
from the tests described above and will take approximately 60 minutes to complete.   Prior to 
the imaging appointment, your child will be asked to complete a screening questionnaire to 
ensure that he/she does not have any contraindications to this type of scan. If any 
contraindications are revealed (i.e. permanent metal dental/orthodontic work, cochlear implant, 
cardiac pacemakers, orthopedic pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]/screws/plates, etc) your child will not complete the MRI

7. Accelerometers:   An accelerometer is a device that measures how fast something is moving.  
Your child will be provided with a sports helmet which will be outfitted with an accelerometer 
that will collect information on the collisions that they happen while playing sports.  An 
accelerometer is a very small device that measures the movement of the helmet.  Your child’s 
play will not be affected by [CONTACT_11384]. 
8. Injury tracking: We will be monitoring your child’s injuries throughout the competitive sports 
season and collecting information about your child’s injuries from the athletic trainer.   
9. Follow Up Visits – If your child is diagnosed with a concussion during the competitive sport 
season, we will have your child come in for an additional study visit 48-[ADDRESS_1040251]-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) form at Sports Medicine.  If your child 
has a concussion, his/her care will be not affected by [CONTACT_50568]. 
 
Group Assignment:  Your child will be assigned to one of two groups at the beginning of the season 
1) Subjects wearing the Q-collar device (seen in Figure on page 1) around the neck or 2) Subjects not 
wearing the Q-collar device for the season.  Both groups will complete the same testing. 
Ultrasound will be used to ensure proper fitting of the collar.  This fitting visit will be completed at the 
school before the first official practice.  The study coordinator will visit the team weekly to monitor the 
use of the collar.  The school athletic trainer will be there daily to ensure proper use and compliance.  
 
 
WHAT ARE THE GOOD THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN FROM THIS RESEARCH? 
 
Being in this study may not help your child right now.  When we finish the study, we hope that we will 
know more about this device and its effectiveness in preventing concussions.  This may help us 
prevent concussions later on.  We do not currently know if this device will protect your child from 
suffering a concussion injury. 
 
 
WHAT ARE THE BAD THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN FROM THIS RESEARCH? 
 
There are no known risks of wearing the Q collar device.  There are no known negative effects from 
exposure to the magnet or radio waves used in the MRI at this time; however it is possible that 
harmful effects could be recognized in the future.   The tight space of the MRI may make some 
people feel uncomfortable.  One known risk is that the magnet can attract certain kinds of metal. 
Therefore, we will have all subjects complete a pre-MRI screening questionnaire.  If there is any 
indication from this questionnaire that the MRI is not safe your child will not have the MRI testing.  
The MRI testing will require your child to lie on their back and remain still for the duration of the test, 
which could last about [ADDRESS_1040252] if you get too uncomfortable. 
 
There is also a minimal risk that the data collected may be viewed by [CONTACT_759733] #: 2015-2205

to hit, block, and play the sport of football in a safe manner. 
 
There may be other risks that we do not know about yet.  
 
 
WHAT OTHER CHOICES ARE THERE? 
 
Instead of being in this study, you can choose not to have your child be in it.   Participating in this 
research is completely voluntary.  Your child will not be punished if he/she decides not to participate. 
 
 
HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CHILD BE KEPT PRIVATE? 
  
Making sure that information about your child remains private is important to us.  To protect your 
child’s privacy in this research study we will:  keep the results of this study confidential. No subject 
identification will be made public record in any form unless you give your expressed written 
permission of release of your child’s name, photograph or likeness captured on video.  Your child has 
the right to privacy.  We will protect your child’s privacy to the extent allowed by [CONTACT_2371].  All facts about 
this study that can describe a subject’s name [CONTACT_312640].  Results of the study will be 
summarized regarding age, etc., but we will take every precaution necessary t o keep names private.  
All subject data will be blinded from the researchers with the use of an identification code.  Personal 
information and identifiers will be securely recorded and filed by [CONTACT_312628].  The 
data will be encrypted with a password and stored on a personal computer and backed up on a 
network drive.  We will be available for any questions that might arise. 
 
Because this research study involves payment for participation we are required by [CONTACT_312629] (IRS) rules to collect and use your social security or tax ID number (SSN) in order 
to track the amount of money that we pay you.  Unless you have given specific permission for another 
use of your SSN related to this research we will only use your SSN to keep track of how much money 
we pay you and your SSN will not be used as part of this research. 
 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may choose to inspect your child’s records since your child 
is a subject in this investigation of an unapproved device.  
 
 
WHAT IF WE LEARN NEW INFORMATION DURING THE RESEARCH?   
 
The study doctor will tell you if they find out about new information from this or other studies that may 
affect your child’s health, safety or your willingness for your child to stay in this study. 
The MR imaging that your child is having as part of this research study will be reviewed by a qualified

Do Not Use After:  
4/11/[ADDRESS_1040254] as it would be if you were having the MRI as part of your child’s routine medical care.  
There is a possibility that while reviewing your child’s MRI we may see an abnormality that we did not 
expect to see in this study. This is what is called an "incidental finding." We will let you know if we see 
such an incidental finding. Depending on the type of incidental finding, we may contact [CONTACT_312630]. If you want, we will give information about this incidental finding to your primary doctor or 
we will refer you to an appropriate doctor for further evaluation. The costs for any care that will be 
needed to diagnose or treat an incidental finding would not be paid for by [CONTACT_98139]. These 
costs would be your responsibility.   
 
WILL IT COST YOU ANYTHING EXTRA FOR YOUR CHILD TO BE IN THE RESEARCH STUDY?  
 
Participating in this study will not cost you anything other than time and effort.  Your insurance will not 
be billed for any testing associated with this study.   
 
 
WILL YOU/YOUR CHILD BE PAID TO BE IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?  
 
You will be reimbursed for your time, effort and travel while you are in this research study. 
 
You (your child) will receive payment for this study in the form of a reloadable debit card (Clincard).  
We will give you (your child) a handout that will explain how to use the card.  Because you (your 
child) are being paid for your participation, CCHMC is required by [CONTACT_312631] (IRS) 
to collect and use your (your child’s) social security number (SSN) or taxpayer identification number 
(TIN) to track the amount of money that we pay.  You will need to complete a Federal W-9 form for 
this income tax reporting.  This form requires your child’s Social Security number.  This form will be 
given to the CCHMC business office.  It will not be kept as part of your child’s study chart.  If you 
move, you will need to complete another W-9 with an updated address. 
 
You (your child) will be paid $[ADDRESS_1040255] ® at the first study visit, and a $[ADDRESS_1040256]® for completing the second study visit.  If you are diagnosed with a concussion, you will 
receive an additional $[ADDRESS_1040257]® for completing a follow up study visit after the 
concussion diagnosis.  
 
 
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR CHILD IS INJURED FROM BEING IN THIS STUDY?  
 
This research does not require that the participant maintains participation in their sport. The desire to 
participate in the sporting event is an independent, personal decision separate from the decision to 
enter into this study.  During the course of this study, we expect that injuries consistent with the sport 
being played will occur, such as head injuries, sprains, fractures, and muscle injuries.  Some of these 
injuries may be severe and have severe consequences.  The choice to participate in the sports and 
accept the risk of the participation in the sport you have chosen is entirely a choice made by [CONTACT_10825].   
Neither the study investigator ([CONTACT_312644]) or CCHMC will be responsible for the medical treatment of 
any sport related injuries.  While the likelihood of an injury related to this research is small, if you 
believe that you have been injured as a result of this research you should contact [CONTACT_759734], PhD

WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT THE RESEARCH? 
If you are diagnosed with a concussion during participation in this study, your medical care will not be 
affected by [CONTACT_312635].  While your insurance will not be billed for any testing associated with 
this study, any further care or treatment will be  billed accordingly.  
 
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE/DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH 
 
To be in this research study you must also give your permission (or authorization) to use and disclose 
(or share) your child’s “protected health information” (called PHI for short).  
 
What protected health information will be used and shared during this study? 
CCHMC will need to use and share your child’s PHI as part of this study.  This PHI will come from: 
 Your child’s CCHMC medical records 
 Your child’s research records 
 
The types of information that will be used and shared from these records include: 
 Laboratory test results, diagnosis, and medications 
 Reports and notes from clinical and research observations 
 Imaging (like CT scans, MRI scans, x-rays, etc.) studies and reports 
 If applicable, information concerning HIV testing or the treatment of AIDS or AIDS-related 
conditions, drug or alcohol abuse, drug-related conditions, alcoholism, and/or 
psychiatric/psychological conditions (but not psychotherapy notes). 
 
Who will share, receive and/or use your child’s protected health information in this study? 
 Staff at all the research study sites (including CCHMC) 
 Personnel who provide services to your child as part of this study

 The members of the CCHMC Institutional Review Board and staff of the Office of Research 
Compliance and Regulatory Affairs. 
 
How will you know that your child’s PHI is not misused? 
People that receive your child’s PHI as part of the research are generally limited in how they can use 
your child’s PHI.  In addition, most people who receive your child’s PHI are also required by [CONTACT_312636]’s PHI.  However, some people that may receive your child’s PHI 
may not be required to protect it and may share the information with others without your permission, if 
permitted by [CONTACT_312637].   
 
Can you change your mind? 
You may choose to withdraw your permission at any time.  A withdrawal of your permission to use 
and share your child’s PHI would also include a withdrawal from participation in the research study.  If 
you wish to withdraw your permission to use and share your child’s PHI you need to notify the study 
doctor, listed on the first page of this document, in writing.  Your request will be effective immediately 
and no new PHI about your child will be used or shared.  The only exceptions are (1) any use or 
sharing of PHI that has already occurred or was in process prior to you withdrawing your permission 
and (2) any use or sharing that is needed to maintain the integrity of the research. 
 
Will this permission expi[INVESTIGATOR_1312]? 
Your permission will expi[INVESTIGATOR_312626].  If the study involves the creation or maintenance 
of a research database repository, this authorization will not expi[INVESTIGATOR_1312].  
 
Will your child’s other medical care be impacted? 
By [CONTACT_312638]’s PHI for the purpose of this research study.  If you refuse to 
sign this document your child will not be able to participate in the study.  However, your child’s rights 
concerning treatment not related to this study, payment for services, enrollment in a health plan or 
eligibility of benefits will not be affected.

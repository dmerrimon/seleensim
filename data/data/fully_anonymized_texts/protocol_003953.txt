 SYNOPSIS 
Study Title:  
Open label pharmacodynamic study of abiraterone acetate  in the treatment of metastatic, castration 
resistant prostate cancer.  
Study:   Investigator -initiated, Phase II  
Funding sup port and abiraterone acetate  provided by  [CONTACT_107279] : 
To d etermine the magnitude of tissue testosterone suppression by  [CONTACT_107280] (resistant to  LHRH agonist  or orchiectomy  ± antiandrogen ) after one month  of treatment to 
establish tissue based mechanism of action . 
Explor atory Objective s: 
 To determine the ability of abiraterone acetate  to suppress tumor testosterone after 12 weeks 
of treatment.  
 To determine tissue testosterone from metastasis at time of radiographic progression during 
abiraterone acetate  treatment.  
 To det ermine response to dose escalation of abiraterone acetate  at clinical progression    
 To determine potential mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone acetate  by [CONTACT_107281],  tissue androgen levels at baseline and at  radiographic  
progression, evaluating wild type and splice variant AR levels at baseline and at time of 
progression and cDNA microarray at progression  
 To determine if microRNA acquired from peripheral blood reflect molecular changes in tumor 
metastases and  are a potential biomarker for mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance.  
 To evaluate pharmacokinetics of dose escalated abiraterone at 1000 mg twice daily  
 
Study Population:  
Men with metastatic, castration resistant  prostate cancer amenable to biopsy  
 Investigational Product , Dose and Mode of Administration:  
Abiraterone acetate , 1000  mg/dose (4 x 250 -mg tablets) given orally, at least 2 hours before a 
meal and 1 hour after a me al, initially given once a day , then twice a day at dose escalation . 
 Abiraterone  acetate will be administered with p rednisone 5 mg given orally twice daily  
Duration of Treatment:  
All patients will undergo pretreatment metastasis biopsy. All patients will receive  Lupron  or 
orchiectomy  combined with abiraterone acetate  and prednisone until radiologic or clinical progression 
as defined by [CONTACT_107282] 2 criteria.  Patients will be sequentially enrolled in 
three cohorts, to undergo repeat biopsy at 4 weeks (cohort 1), 12 weeks (cohort 2) or at progression  
(cohort 3).  Dose escalation after initial radiographic progression for all patients  is allowed until there 
is evidence of additional radiographic or clinical progression.

 Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint:  
 Tissue testosterone  
Exploratory endpoints  
 Tissue and serum DHT, androstenedione, DHEA,  
 PSA kinetics  and radiologic changes by [CONTACT_393]  1.1  
 Androgen receptor – wild type and splice variant levels  
 cDNA microarray analysis, RT -PCR  
 MicroRNA  
 Pharmacokinetics of abiraterone  
 
Statistical Methods  for sam ple size calculation  
The primary endpoint is evaluation of the suppression of tissue testosterone from baseline (the last 
value on or before the date of first study treatment) to the [ADDRESS_119220] in castrate male mice. Baseline tissue testosterone 
in untreated CRPC xenografts was 0.687 ± 0.364 (mean ± SD) pg/mg, approximating that seen in 
human CRPC metastases. Nadir tissue testosterone after 7–21 days was 0.027 ± 0.009 pg/mg, 
approximating 4-week levels. Using the SD  of testosterone deriv ed from untreated observations 
(0.364 pg/ mg), 6 patients provide 94% power to detect the anticipated 0.660 pg/mg difference in 
tissue testosterone relative to baseline based on a 2-sided paired t -test with alpha 5%.  Ten patients per 
cohort will be included to account for potentially unproductive  biopsies.

Deprivation 
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the primary treatment for patients with advanced 
prostate cancer since the seminal recognition of the disease as androgen-dependent by [CONTACT_107283] 1941 [ 1]. Although highly effective in stabilizing disease in hormone-naïve patients, 
ADT is uniformly marked by [CONTACT_107284], castration-resistant disease over a period of 
18-[ADDRESS_119228] shown that despi[INVESTIGATOR_107253] (T) levels, 
intraprostatic androgen levels remain substantial, at about 20-25% of the levels found in untreated 
patients [ 2-4]. Soft tissue metastases from patients with anorchid serum testosterone contain 
tumoral levels of T which are higher than levels in prostate tumors in eugonadal men [ 5]. Transcript 
levels for enzymes of androgen synthesis, including CYP17, were upregulated in the same tumors 
from 8 to 30 fold, suggesting that tumoral synthesis from cholesterol is possible.  These levels of 
testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are well within the concentration of androgens able to 
activate the androgen receptor and to mediate proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells. 
Therefore, ‘castrate’ levels of T and DHT are clearly capable of continuing to modulate 
intraprostatic androgen-regulated gene expression, protein synthesis, cell survival and proliferation, 
[4, 6, 7] suggesting that clinical castration defined by [CONTACT_11084] T levels cannot be equated with 
cellular castration at the tissue and genomic level.   Intratumoral androgens, including residual T, 
DHT and adrenal androgens, are implicated in nearly every mechanism whereby [CONTACT_107285]-mediated 
signaling leads to the development of castration-resistant disease [ 8-11]. These mechanisms 
include: 1) AR hypersensitivity due to AR gene amplification, over-expression, increased AR 
stability, or co-regulator alterations that modulate ligand sensitivity [ 12-14]; 2) AR mutations that 
broaden ligand specificity and confer sensitivity to adrenal androgens [ 15]; 3) nongenomic 
mechanisms whereby [CONTACT_107286] T and DHT modulate signaling cascades (11); and 4) tumor-specific 
dysregulation of steroid metabolic pathways effectively potentiating the intraprostatic conversion of 
adrenal androgens to T and DHT. [ 16-18].  
The next generation of effective agents in the treatment of prostate cancer leverage the ability to 
block tissue androgen synthesis more completely .  Abiraterone acetate is a specific CYP17 inhibitor 
with activity demonstrated against CRPC.  The proposed mechanism of action is suppression of 
androgen levels in tumor tissue as a result of suppression of testicular, adrenal and tumoral CYP17 
activity.  Clinical studies have demonstrated suppression of serum androgen levels [ 19] and 
xenograft studies from our group demonstrate suppression of tumor tissue androgens in preclinical 
models even in the setting of castrate serum levels [ 20].  Phase I and II studies have been published 
and demonstrated safety of the agent as well as efficacy of the drug in men with CRPC both before 
and after docetaxel therapy [ 21, 22].  These studies led to the definitive phase III registration study , 
COU- AA-301 in men with metastatic CRPC.  In this study, 1195 men with CRPC previously 
treated with docetaxel based chemotherapy were randomized to abiraterone acetate with prednisone 
or prednisone alone [ 23].  The study demonstrated a 3.[ADDRESS_119229] ratio of 0.65, favoring abiraterone acetate therapy.  Systemic effects attributable to 
a
biraterone acetate were primarily related to increased mineralocorticoid levels (hypertension,

 hypokalemia, edema).  The improvement in relative risk of death is better than other drugs used in 
the treatment of advanced disease and led to FDA approval of abiraterone acetate for the treatment 
of metastatic, CRPC in patients treated with docetaxel.  Abiraterone acetate is an effective 
hormonal therapy which directly targets steroidogenesis and suppresses serum hormone levels 
while improving survival.  As the first in a new generation of agents targeting androgen receptor 
signaling, critical questions remain to be answered regarding mechanisms of effect in tissue and 
relevant mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance. 
Previous work cited above demonstrated that despi[INVESTIGATOR_107254], there is limited effect on tissue androgens and resistance is associated 
with augmented signaling through the androgen receptor [ 5, 13, 24].  Our group has performed 
detailed analysis of the effects of abiraterone acetate in two human CRPC xenografts grown in 
castrate murine hosts.  These studies demonstrate that; 1) Abiraterone acetate suppresses tissue 
hormone levels and improves survival in two human prostate cancer xenografts, in an animal model 
lacking adrenal androgens; 2) Exposure to abiraterone acetate induced upregulation of both wild 
type androgen receptor (AR) and oncogenic splice variant AR’s lacking ligand binding domain.  
These data suggest that abiraterone acetate suppresses de novo androgen synthesis by [CONTACT_107287].  In addition, a subset of tumors recurred with elevated 
tissue androgen and CYP17 levels, suggesting breakthrough of CYP17 inhibition.  These 
mechanisms of resistance would provide potentially important points of inflection for either 
preventing or treating abiraterone acetate resistance in human tumors.  There have been no studies 
evaluating abiraterone acetate effect on tumor tissue from patients.  This study is designed to 
evaluate abiraterone acetate effect on tissue androgen levels in metastases from patients with 
metastatic CRPC, while evaluating tumoral AR and androgens over the course of treatment as a 
potential point of inflection for determin ing optimal combinations and sequential therapy.  Dose 
e
scalation will be explored to determine if [ADDRESS_119230] on tumor is an 
additional potential mechanism of secondary resistance to abiraterone therapy.  There is limited 
data available regarding abiraterone pharmacokinetics after prolonged dosing of abiraterone and 
there is evidence that ability of other, less effective CYP17 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, to 
suppress androgen levels wanes with time due either to incomplete CYP17 block or altered 
pharmacokinetics [31, 32].   The addition of formal pharmacokinetic evaluations before and after 
dose escalation would provide important information about secondary resistance to abiraterone 
therapy.     
1.2 Abiraterone acetate (JNJ212082) 
Abiraterone acetate is a steroidal irr eversible inhibitor of CYP17 (17α hydroxylase/C17,20 -lyase), 
blocking 2 important enzymatic activities in the synthesis of testosterone (Figure 1), based on the 
observation that nonsteroidal 3 pyridyl esters improved selectivity for inhibition of 17α -
hydroxylase/C17,20 lyase.  Abiraterone acetate is a potent inhibitor with an apparent inhibition 
constant of 0.5 nM.  In patients with castration resistant prostate cancer which was chemotherapy

 naïve, PSA response rates were 65%, and in those with previously treated with docetaxel, the PSA 
response rate was 50% with an objective response rate of 22% [ 25].  These response rates are 
significantly better than any agent in chemotherapy naïve or pretreated patients. Pharmacodynamic 
studies demonstrated that its effects on adrenal steroid synthesis were consistent with its mechanism 
of action.  Antitumor effects were evident with PSA response and durable objective responses using 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria [ 26].   In the initial phase I study 
there were no grade 3 or 4 toxicities reported.  In a heavily pretreated patient population who had 
received prior docetaxel, the incidence of grade 3 and 4 toxicity was 25%, with 4 % grade 4 
toxicity.  The grade 4 toxicities were a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_107255] a second malignancy.

Confidential Page [ADDRESS_119232] Phase 1 study with capsule formulation (COU-
AA-001) [ 26], abiraterone acetate was evaluated for safety, pharmacokinetics, and its effects on 
adrenal steroid synthesis at dose levels ranging from 250 mg to 2000 mg. Consistent with 
abiraterone acetate ’s mechanism of action, hypertension (HTN), hypokalemia, and  edema were 
the most commonly-observed drug-related adverse events, which were manageable with 
medication.  Adrenal metabolite analysis showed inhibition of CPY17 even at low doses of 
abiraterone acetate and a compensatory increase of corticosterone and deoxycorticosterone.  
Analysis showed that abiraterone acetate was well tolerated at all dose levels, including 2000 
mg daily, with no grade 3 or greater toxicity at 2000 mg daily.  There were no hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107256].   
Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies showed increased systemic drug exposure at higher doses.   
Responses to abiraterone acetate were seen at similar rates for all doses of drug which 
substantially suppressed serum androgen levels.  Because no clear difference in response in 
these chemotherapy and abiraterone acetate naïve patients was discernible at higher doses, 
further dose escalation was stopped beyond [ADDRESS_119233] by [CONTACT_107288]17, as 
demonstrated in our recently published data in preclinical models (section 1.1), provides 
rationale for increasing dose in the event of tumor progression.   
1.2.2 Concurrent Prednisone  
In ongoing studies, patients receiving abiraterone acetate are being treated concurrently with 
glucocorticoids, including prednisone. Based on the mechanism of abiraterone acetate action 
and observations in patients with congenital deficiency of CYP17, it was anticipated that a state 
of mineralocorticoid excess could occur after pharmacologic inhibition of CYP17. Resulting 
reduced cortisol levels may lead to a compensatory ACTH surge thereby [CONTACT_107289], hypokalemia, and fluid retention.  Notably, patients with the rare syndrome of 
congenital CYP17 deficiency do not develop adrenocortical insufficiency as corticosterone 
synthesis is unaffected.  However, as corticosterone is a weaker glucocorticoid than cortisol, 
interruption of negative feedback control of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) occurs, 
resulting in high levels of ACTH and steroid precursors upstream of CYP17 [ 27].  As expected, 
whe
n abiraterone acetate was used as a single agent in Phase 1 and 2 studies, hypertension, 
hypokalemia, and fluid retention were observed and were primarily CTC grade 1-2 in severity.  
These side effects were readily managed with potassium supplementation, eplerenone (selective 
mineralocorticoid antagonist), antihypertensive agents, and low dose corticosteroids.  Grade 1-2 
fatigue was observed in some patients and was associated with discontinuation of 
corticosteroids as required per Phase 2 protocol entry criteria and extended duration of treatment 
with abiraterone acetate.  Although there was no evidence of a dose-response relationship, 
administration of low dose corticosteroids as specified in the study improved symptoms of 
fatigue and tolerability of abiraterone acetate, including symptoms of mineralocorticosteroid 
excess.  The improved tolerability of abiraterone acetate after concomitant administration of 
low-dose corticosteroids was associated with suppression of ACTH surge and upstream adrenal

Confidential Page [ADDRESS_119234] be ascertained at the tissue and 
molecular level [ 4, 5]. The hypothesis of this study is that abiraterone acetate achieves more 
e
ffective tumor control through suppression of adrenal and tumoral androgen production and will 
result in lower intratumoral levels of DHT and testosterone.   Confirming tissue suppression of 
tumor androgens is critical as the limited ability of standard LHRH agonist therapy to suppress 
tissue androgens has only recently been recognized more than [ADDRESS_119235] guided tissue acquisition, with 
successful tissue acquisition in 70% of the biopsy sessions.   Patients unable to undergo metastasis 
biopsy may undergo biopsy of primary prostate instead, as resistant primary prostate cancer also 
upregulates androgens.  The standard operating procedure for tissue acquisition and processing is 
contained in the separate lab manual (Tissue Acquisition and Processing). Tissue from the six core 
biopsies will be collected and analyzed for tissue DHT, testosterone, DHEA and androstenedione, 
a
s well as AR and AR splice variants. These assays are well established within our group [ 5, 28, 
29].  Serum androgens drawn at the same time intervals will be compared with the tissue androgens 
measured above. Three cohorts of patients will be treated with LHRH agonist or orchiectomy, 
Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily in order to allow evaluation of 
tissue androgens and mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone acetate. The total cohort size will be 
10 patients per cohort with successful acquisition of tumor at initial biopsy.  Repeat biopsy will be 
performed at 4 weeks (cohort 1), 12 weeks (cohort 2) or at progression as defined by [CONTACT_107290] (cohort 3).  We will sequentially assign patients to repeat biopsy at 4 weeks or 12 
weeks until both cohorts are complete.  Patients who progress prior to planned biopsy will be 
considered part of cohort 3 and undergo biopsy at progression.  Once cohorts 1 and 2 are full, all 
patients will be assigned to cohort 3. All patients will be offered elective participation in evaluation 
of
 pharmacokinetics at progression at 1000 mg daily.  For patients in all cohorts, there will be the

dose (2000 mg per day) in two divided doses (1000 mg BID) may help circumvent this issue by 
[CONTACT_107291].  Dose 
escalation will test the hypothesis generated from preclinical studies that more effective CYP17 
inhibition may provide additional benefit in the face of tumor progression.

.1.1 Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint (testosterone) will be assayed from the tumor biopsy procured at 
baseline, and at approximately Week 4.  Tissue androgen measurements will be performed by 
[CONTACT_107294] s.  Assumptions regarding basal tissue androgens and androgens 
after abiraterone acetate treatment at response and progression are derived from xenograft 
studies of abiraterone acetate effect in castrate male mice. Baseline tissue testosterone in 
untreated CRPC xenografts is 0.687 ± 0.364 pg/mg, approximating that seen in human CRPC 
metastases.  Nadir tissue testosterone at 7 and 21 days is 0.027 ± 0.009 pg/mg (approximating 
one and three month levels) which rise to 0.2 22 ± 0.246 pg/mg at progression.

  PSA response as defined as decline from the PSA at initiation of therapy and then with 
dose escalation of abiraterone acetate will be evaluated per PCWG2 criteria.  This will be 
determined by [CONTACT_43876]’s performed at monthly intervals.  The subsequent response to dose 
escalation (if any) will be correlated with tumor androgens.   
 RECIST - participants with measurable disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_393] (1.1), bone 
scan and PSA criteria. For the purposes of this study, participants should be re-evaluated 
every [ADDRESS_119240] criteria for progression on imaging.  Patients should not be 
taken off treatment for PSA progression alone but should remain on treatment until 
documented progression by [CONTACT_9661]

 AR levels – tumor tissue will be evaluated by [CONTACT_937]-PCR for wild type and splice variant 
(AResdel567 and ARv7) at initiation of therapy, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and progression. 
 cDNA microarray – microdissected tumor from biopsies taken at progression will be 
processed and analyzed as previously described  in order to identify signaling pathways 
relevant in progression (Risk, Clin Cancer Res. 2010 16:5414-23.)

____________________________________________________________________ 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_119248] study treated 1195 patients who had 
previously received docetaxel (COU-301). This study showed that abiraterone acetate improved 
overall survival by [ADDRESS_119249] ratio of 0.65 for 
patients receiving abiraterone acetate. The secondary endpoints of PSA response and time to 
progression also favored abiraterone acetate.  Based on this study abiraterone acetate was 
approved for use in men with metastatic, CRPC after prior docetaxel therapy. The second study 
treated 1088 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had not received 
previous chemotherapy.(COU-302). This study showed that abiraterone acetate improved 
radiographic progression free survival compared to prednisone alone with a hazard ratio of 0.53 
for patients receiving abiraterone acetate. Based on this study abiraterone acetate was approved 
for use in men with metastatic, CRPC prior to docetaxel therapy.  Abiraterone acetate 250-mg 
tablets are oval, white to off-white and contain abiraterone acetate and compendial 
(U
SP/NF/EP) grade lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, 
povidone, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, and purified 
water, in descending order of concentration (the water is removed during tableting). Abiraterone 
acetate for this study will be provided by [CONTACT_107302].  
[ADDRESS_119250] one hour after the dose of abiraterone 
acetate is taken.  Abiraterone Cmax and AUC0- ∞ (exposure) were inc reased up to 17- and 10-
fold higher, respectively, when a single dose of abiraterone was administered with a meal 
compared to a fasted state. The safety of these increased exposures when multiple doses of 
abiraterone  are taken with food has not been assessed.  Treatment will continue until there is 
evidence of clinical or radiologic progression or intolerance to drug (Grade 3 or 4). . Patient 
compliance will be tracked through interview and pi[INVESTIGATOR_107257].  If an abiraterone 
acetate dose is missed, it should be omitted and will not be made up. If dosing compliance is not 
100%

 Starting on study Day 1, patients will be instructed to take 5-mg prednisone PO twice daily.  
Treatment duration of prednisone will be for the duration of study concurrent with abiraterone 
acetate. In the abiraterone acetate dose escalation cohort at progression, prednisone dose will 
not be changed. At discontinuation of study , after abiraterone acetate is discontinued, 
prednisone will be decreased to 5 mg every other day for one week and then discontinued. If a 
prednisone dose is missed, it should be omitted and will not be made up.  
Although not considered a study agent, subjects will also receive their regularly prescribed

Concurrent enrollment in another clinical investigational drug or device study is prohibited. 
Supportive care medications are permitted with their use following institutional guidelines.  
The following supportive care medications are considered permissible during the study: 
 Conventional multivitamins, selenium and soy supplements  
 Additional systemic glucocorticoid administration such as “stress dose” glucocorticoid is 
permitted if clinically indicated and in such cases, the use of steroids will be documented 
as concomitant drug 
 If the permissibility of a specific drug/treatment is in question, please contact [CONTACT_31821] -sponsor. 
5.4 Restrictions  
The concurrent administration of other anticancer therapy, including cytotoxic or hormonal agents 
(except LHRH agonists), or immunotherapy, is prohibited therapy.  Use of other investigational 
drug therapy for any reason is prohibited.   The decision to administer a prohibited drug/treatment 
will be made by [CONTACT_107304] e  safety of study participant. 
5.5 Potential for Drug -Drug Interactions  
Effects of Abiraterone on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes 
Abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6. In a 
CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the Cmax and AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) 
were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when dextromethorphan was given with abiraterone 
acetate 1000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of abiraterone

 acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., thioridazine). If 
alternative treatments cannot be used, exercise caution and consider a dose reduction of the 
concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug  
In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (CYP2C8 
substrate) was increased by 46% when pi[INVESTIGATOR_97079] a single dose of 
1,000mg abiraterone acetate. Therefore, patient should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity 
related to CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with Zytiga.  
 
Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes 
In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 
inducer (rifampin, 600 mg daily for 6 days) followed by a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1000 
mg, the mean plasma AUC∞ of abiraterone was decreased by 55%.  Strong inducers of CYP3A4 
(e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) during treatment 
with ZYTIGA are to be avoided, or used with careful evaluation of clinical efficacy.  
In a separate clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects, coadministration of 
ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on th e 
pharmacokinetics of abiraterone.

2. PSA response as defined as decline from the PSA at initiation of therapy and with dose 
escalation of abiraterone acetate will be evaluated per PCWG2 criteria.  This will be 
determined by [CONTACT_43876]’s performed at monthly intervals.  The subsequent response to dose 
escalation (if any) will be correlated with tumor androgens. 
3. RECIST - participants with measurable disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_393] (1.1), bone scan 
a

progression alone but should remain on treatment until documented progression by [CONTACT_9661]. 
Detailed discussion of progression and response is outlined in Appendix 5.  
4. AR levels – tumor tissue will be evaluated by [CONTACT_937]-PCR for wild type and splice variant 
(AResdel567 and ARv7) at initiation of therapy, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and progression. 
5. Pharmacokinetics – plasma samples drawn at progression and after dose escalation will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_107309] (LC-MS/MS) 
with subsequent calculation of Cmax, Tmax, and AUC(0-24) 
6. MicroRNA - Plasma will be collected for miRNA analysis by [CONTACT_107298], Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.  In these analyses a panel of m iRNA’s will be assessed 
at baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and progression in the cohorts undergoing biopsy at these 
time points. Plasma samples will be profiled for the relative abundance of 375 miRNAs by 
[CONTACT_107299]- to-Use PCR, Human Panel I, V2.M qRT-PCR arrays.   Candidate 
miRNA strongly associated with response or progression will be quantitated in biopsy tissue 
as possible.

6.7 Safety Data Collection, Recording and Reporting 
All observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of causal relationship to study drug will be 
recorded on the adverse event page(s) of the case report form (CRF). 
Please refer to Appendix 4 for Janssen Services, LLC’s “ Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
for Interventional Studies.”   Some of the information may overlap with the items below. 
6.7.1 Definition of Adverse Event (AE) 
An adverse event is defined in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline 
for Good Clinical Practice as “ Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment ” (ICH E6:1.2).  An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
diagnosis or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
related to the medicinal product.   For the purposes of this study, temporal association is defined 
as the time between the subject’s informe d consent signature [CONTACT_10782] 28 days after the final 
dose of abiraterone acetate.   
AEs 
further include worsening of a pre-existing medical condition (e.g., diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout, hypertension, etc.) which has increased in severity, frequency or duration, or is 
associated with significantly worsened outcomes.   
The investigator or a medically licensed designee must pursue and obtain information adequate 
to determine the following:  Grade (CTCAE v4.0), Causality (relationship to abiraterone 
a
cetate) and Outcome.  . The investigator’s assessment of Grade, any Intervention (medication, 
procedure, etc.), Causality and Outcome will be indicated by [CONTACT_107310] [INVESTIGATOR_107262].  For adverse events with a causal relationship to the 
investigational product, follow-up by [CONTACT_107311] a level acceptable to the investigator, or his/her designated representative.   
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) 
A noxious and unintended response to any dose of the drug (or biological) product for which 
there is a reasonable possibility that the product cause the response.  ‘‘Reasonable possibility’’ 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.

 Special Reporting Situations (SRS)  
When a report contains a J&J product, an identifiable patient, and identifiable reporter, the  
following events represent Special Reporting Situations: 
 overdose of a [COMPANY_012] medicinal product  
 pregnancy exposure (maternal and paternal) 
 exposure to medicinal product from breastfeeding  
 suspected abuse/misuse of medicinal [COMPANY_012] product 
 inadvertent or accidental exposure to medicinal [COMPANY_012] product 
 any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of medicinal Johnson 
& Johnson product 
 unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from medicinal [COMPANY_012] product  
 medication error involving medicinal [COMPANY_012] product with or without patient 
exposure to the medicinal [COMPANY_012] product (e.g., name [CONTACT_2976]) 
 suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal [COMPANY_012] 
product  
Adverse events of special interest to Janssen Services, LLC include hypokalemia, abnormal 
liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin), hypertension and edema.  See Management of Study 
Drug-related Adverse Events, for clinical management of both special interest and general AEs.   
If the investigator or designee determines that an AE meets the criteria for classification as a 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Suspected Unexpected Adverse Event Reporting (S[LOCATION_003]R), 
s/he will immediately notify the UW/FHCRC Cancer Consortium IRB, Janssen Services and 
FDA.  See Section 6.7.2 for definition of SAEs and S[LOCATION_003]Rs, and 6.7.4 for reporting guidelines. 
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (e.g., elective cosmetic surgery) or medical procedures 
that were planned before study enrollment are not considered adverse events.   
6.7.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An adverse event or suspected adverse rea ction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of the 
investigator or a medically licensed designee, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death,  
 a life-threatening adverse event,  
o Life-threatening adverse event or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction .  
 An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life -
threatening’’ if  its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate 
risk of death.  This definition does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.

  a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or  
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 is a suspected transmission of infectious agents by a medicinal product 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107263] “serious” is any in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107264] a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility.  Interventions for 
pretreatment conditions (e.g., elective cosmetic surgery) or medical procedures that were 
planned before study enrollment are not considered SAE/S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purposes of this 
study.  Inpatient admission does not include admissions to rehabilitation facilities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103876], skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, routine emergency room admissions, same 
day surgery (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures) or social admission (e.g., subject 
has no place to sleep). 
6.7.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Events (S[LOCATION_003]RS) 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]RS) are events which are serious as 
per the above criteria, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable 
product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert) and are j udged by [CONTACT_107312].   
6.7.4 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all non-serious adverse events (as defined in 
Section 6.71 and as further specified below) observed by [CONTACT_107313] 
a
re collected and recorded in the CRF.  Source documents may include the subjects’ medical 
records, patient diaries or study-specific worksheets.  Recording for all events should be done in 
a concise manner using standard, acceptable medical terms.   New AEs occurring between the 
patient’s consent signature [CONTACT_10782] [ADDRESS_119261] dose of abiraterone acetate will be 
captured.   
The adverse event recorded should not be a procedure or a clinical measurement (i.e. a 
laboratory value or vital sign) but should reflect the reason for the procedure or the diagnosis 
based on the abnormal measurement. 
Preexisting conditions that worsen in severity or frequency during the Study should also be 
recorded (a preexisting condition that does not worsen is not an adverse event).   Further, a 
procedure or surgery is not an adverse event; rather, the event leading to the procedure or 
surgery is considered an adverse event.  Any event requiring unplanned in-patient

Confidential Page [ADDRESS_119262]’s participation in a tr ial must be 
reported as an SAE, as previously stated. 
If, in the investigator’s  judgment, a clinical ly significant worsening from baseline is observed in 
any laboratory or other test parameter (e.g. electrocardiogram (ECG), angiogram), physical 
exam finding, or vital sign, a corresponding clinical adverse event should be recorded. 
If a specific medical diagnosis has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded as 
the adverse event, whenever possible.  However, a complete description of the signs, symptoms 
and investigations which led to the diagnosis should be provided.  For example, if clinically 
significant elevations of liver function tests are known to be secondary to hepa titis, “hepatitis” 
and not “elevated liver function tests” should be recorded.   If the cause is not known, the 
abnormal test or finding should be recorded as an adverse event, using appropriate medical 
terminology (e.g., thrombocytopenia, peripheral edema, QT prolongation). 
F
or all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_47515] (e.g., study drug, other illness, progressive 
malignancy, etc.).  The relationship of the adverse event to the investigational product will be 
a
ssessed by [CONTACT_7859], “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?”  The investigator should respond to this  question 
with either Yes or No.  
All clinically important abnormal laboratory tests occurring during the study will be repeated at 
appropriate intervals until they return either to baseline or to a level deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_107314]/her designated representative, or until a diagnosis that explains them is made.  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal laboratory test result should be reported as an 
adverse event are as follows: 
1. test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or 
2. test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention (merely 
repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not meet 
criteria for a reportable AE), and/or 
3. test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or 
4. test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of a serious adverse 
event, and/or 
5. test result is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_4687], and/or 
6. test result is CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_119263] result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
adverse event, even if it did meet one of the above conditions except for condition #4.  
Clinically significant laboratory results deemed Related to IP must be recorded in the patient’s 
CRF.

6.7.[ADDRESS_119267] common adverse events related to abiraterone acetate 
monotherapy include fatigue due to reduced cortisol level as a result of CYP17 inhibition; and 
hypertension, fluid retention, and hypokalemia due to mineralocorticoid excess caused by 
[CONTACT_107317].  In this study, the concomitant administration of prednisone is 
expected to mitigate these side effects by [CONTACT_107318].   
During study, corticosteroid treatment will be provided.  It has been documented that following 
prolonged therapy with corticosteroids, patients may develop Cushing’s syndrome characterized 
by [CONTACT_107319], thin skin, easy bruising, and proximal myopathy.  Withdrawal of the 
corticosteroid may result in symptoms that include fever, myalgia, fatigue, arthralgia, and 
malaise.  This may occur even without evidence of adrenal insufficiency.   
For guidance on management of side effects of glucocorticoid usage, symptoms related to 
castration (androgen deprivation), severe and refractory headaches, fatigue, or other toxicities 
not listed below please contact [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_107268].   
Re-initiation of study treatment after resolution of adverse events must be discussed with and

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hypertension, Hypokalemia and Fluid Retention Due to 
Mineralocorticoid Excess  
Use Abiraterone acetate with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. 
Abiraterone acetate may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention as a 
consequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition [see 
Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].  Co-administration of a 
corticosteroid suppresses adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) drive, resulting in a 
reduction in the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions. Use caution when 
treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by 
[CONTACT_55254], hypokalemia or fluid retention, e.g., those with heart failure, 
recent myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia. The safety of Abiraterone acetate

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Adrenocortical Insufficiency 
Adrenocortical insufficiency has been reported in clinical trials in patients receiving 
Abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone, following interruption of daily 
steroids and/or with concurrent infection or stress. Use caution and monitor for symptoms 
and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency, particularly if patients are withdrawn from 
prednisone, have prednisone dose reductions, or experience unusual stress. Symptoms 
and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency may be masked by [CONTACT_107320]. If

5.3 Management of Hepa totoxicity 
All patients will undergo assessment of liver function prior to enrollment on study.  For 
patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment with abiraterone at 1000 mg daily 
(ALT and/or AST greater than 5x ULN or total bilirubin greater than 3x ULN), interrupt 
treatment with abiraterone.  Treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 750 mg once 
da
ily following return of liver function tests to the patient’s baseline or to AST and ALT 
less than or equal to 2.5x ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5x ULN.  For 
patients who resume treatment, monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin at a minimum 
of every two weeks for three months and monthly thereafter. If hepatotoxicity recurs at 
the dose of 750 mg once daily, re-treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 500 mg 
once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient’s baseline or to AST and 
ALT less than or equal to 2.5X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5X ULN. 
If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of [ADDRESS_119268] and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10x ULN 
is 
unknown. Patients who develop hepa totoxicity (ALT and/or AST greater than 5x ULN 
or total bilirubin greater than 3x ULN) during treatment with dose escalated abiraterone 
at 1000 mg twice daily will be removed from study.

DOSAGE FORMS AND Criteria for Discontinuation of Study 
The development of > 20% incidence of grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity (CTCAE v4 .0) during 
administration of abiraterone acetate in the treatment of patients in cohort 3 will prompt review of 
toxicity and if appropriate, suspension of study.   
6.9 Withdrawal from Study 
The investigator may withdraw a patient from any phase of the study for any of the following 
reasons.  
 Discontinuation of treatment criteria as defined in Section 6.8 
 Dosing noncompliance:  If a patient misses 14 or more doses within a 4 week period the 
patient should be discontinued from the study treatment period.   
 Sustained Side Effects:  Patients who have sustained toxicities, such as hyperglycemia or 
hypertension that do not return to NCI CTCAE (version 3) Grade 1 or less with appropriate 
medical management, should be discontinued from the study treatment.   
 Administration of prohibited medications:  The patient will be discontinued from the protocol 
treatment when prohibited drug is administered. Supportive care medications are permitted 
with their use following institutional guidelines.  The concurrent administration of other 
anticancer therapy, including cytotoxic, hormonal (except LHRH agonists), or 
immunotherapy is prohibited during study treatment Phase.  Use of other investigational drug 
therapy for any reason is prohibited. 
 Patient withdraws consent.  In this event, the reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented 
and clarification if withdrawal of consent includes follow-up phase for progression data 
collection.  A patient’s decision to take part in the study is voluntary and he may choose not 
to take part in the study or to stop taking part at any time.  If he chooses not to take part or to 
stop at any time, it will not affect his future medical care or medical benefits.

protocol treatment.  A metastasis biopsy will be done while still on abiraterone acetate at 4 weeks 
(cohort 1), or at 12 weeks (cohort 2) or at the time of progression (cohort 3).  After progression, 
dose escalation to 1000 mg twice daily will be allowed.  The tumor biopsy at designated time point 
(Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks or progression) is mandatory and can be done +/- 30 days of initiation 
of therapy for baseline biopsy and at approximate timepoints for 4 and 12 week timepoints.

therapy.  There is limited data available regarding abiraterone pharmacokinetics after prolonged 
dosing of abiraterone and there is evidence that ability of other, less effective CYP17 inhibitors 
such as ketoconazole, to suppress androgen levels wanes with time due either to incomplete 
CYP17 block or altered pharmacokinetics [31, 32].   The addition of formal pharmacokinetic 
evaluations before and after dose would provide important information about secondary 
resistance to abiraterone therapy.  The proposed pharmacokinetic sampling would be as follows:  
 At progression, dose = [ADDRESS_119273] dose (Note: patient will take the next daily 
dose 
AFTER the 24-hour post-do se sample is collected) 
 7-[ADDRESS_119274] AM dose (Note: patient will take the

All patients in all cohorts will be offered the option of dose escalation to 1000 mg twice daily.  
This dose escalation will explore whether subsequent response is associated with higher than 
anticipated tissue testosterone levels and/or CYP17 levels will explore the potential that 
resistance may be mediated by [CONTACT_107323]17 with 
subsequent tumor androgen maintenance, as seen in preclinical studies cited in section 1.1.  As 
previously noted, in published phase I studies, there was no grade 3 or 4 toxicity in patients 
treated with 2000 mg daily abiraterone acetate achieved proportional increases in serum 
abiraterone acetate levels [ 26].  Those patients who go on to therapy with abiraterone acetate

 8 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS 
8.1 General Considerations 
The primary endpoint is evaluation of the decrease of tissue testosterone from baseline (the last 
value on or before the date of first study treatment) to the 4-week time point. Sample size 
calculations for this endpoint are based on xenograft studies of abiraterone acetate. Planned analysis 
of primary and exploratory endpoints involves numerical and graphical summaries and standard 
statistical hypothesis tests and linear-model-based inference. 
8.[ADDRESS_119277] in castrate male mice. Baseline tissue 
testosterone in untreated CRPC xenografts was 0.687 ± 0.364 (mean ± SD) pg/mg, approximating 
that seen in human CRPC metastases. Nadir tissue testosterone after 7– 21 days was 0.027 ± 0.009 
pg/mg, approximating 4-week levels. Using the SD of testosterone derived from untreated 
obser
vations (0.364 pg/mg), 6 patients provide 94% power to detect the anticipated 0.660 pg/mg 
difference in tissue testosterone relative to baseline based on a 2-sided paired t-test with alpha 5%. 
However, in our experience only 75% of CT and ultrasound guided biopsies yield evaluable tissue; 
consequently 6/10 patients are expected to provide evaluable tissue measurements at both baseline 
and after 4 weeks. 
Data Analysis: Tissue testosterone measurements will be summarized numerically and graphically 
using plots of patient- and cohort-specific longitudinal patterns and side- by-side boxplots at each 
time point. Other tissue androgen levels will be similarly graphed and examined. 
As in the power calculation, we will test the primary endpoint —change in tissue testosterone after 4 
weeks —using a 2-sided paired t-test and consider an attained significance level of 5% statistically 
significant. We will also test exploratory hypotheses —change in tissue testosterone after 12 weeks 
and at progression —using the same test and significance level. We anticipate power to detect 
change in tissue testosterone after [ADDRESS_119278]-nadir tissue testosterone rose to 0.222 ± 0.246 pg/mg 
at progression; we therefore anticipate that, using the SD of testosterone derived from untreated 
observations (0.364 pg/mg), 7 patients achieving progression will provide 80% power to detect the 
anticipated 0.465 pg/mg difference in tissue testosterone relative to baseline based on a 2-sided 
paired t-test with alpha 5%. 
Analysis of microarray data will evaluate change in gene expression (expressed as log ratio relative 
to human gold standard) by [CONTACT_107325] , qvalue, and related 
Bioconductor statistical analysis software packages. 
8.[ADDRESS_119279] one dose of study drug will be included in the analysis of safety

Demographic variables will include age, race, ethnicity, height, and weight. Baseline disease 
characteristics will include PSA, Gleason Grade, and clinical stage.  
8.5 Safety Evaluations 
Treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) directly related to abiraterone acetate are those events 
that occur or worsen on or after first dose of study drug up through [ADDRESS_119281] dose.  Adverse 
events will be coded using the MedDRA coding system and all AEs will be graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (NCI-
CTCAE). An acute adverse event will be defined as an adverse event occurring up to and including 
90 days after initiation of RT.  A late adverse event will be defined as an adverse event occurring 
more than 90 days after the initiation of RT.  Unacceptable toxicity is defined as grade 3 or higher 
toxicity.  Incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term 
(PT).  Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_479], according to the worst grade experienced.  In 
the summary of AE, an AE occurs more than once within a SOC and PT will be counted only once 
using the worst grade experienced.   
All adverse events resulting in discontinuation, dose modification, dosing interruption, and/or 
treatment delay of study drug will also be listed and tabulated by [CONTACT_11702]. 
Clinical laboratory test results will be collected pretreatment and through [ADDRESS_119282] values will also 
be summarized. 
Electrocardiograms data will be descriptively summarized for QTc, PR interval, and QRS at each 
assessment. Comparison between baseline and maximum on-study QTc will also be presented.  
Both Fredericia and Bazett corrections will be reported.

administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
related to the medicinal product.  
 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Events that the Janssen Services, LLC representative is actively monitoring as a 
re
sult of a previously identified signal (even if non-serious), and are described in 
Section 6.7, above. 
 
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) 
A noxious and unintended response to any dose of the drug (or biological) 
product for which there is a reasonable possibility that the product cause the 
response.  ‘‘Reasonable possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction 
im
plies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which 
means any adverse event caused by a drug.

The specific J&J drug under study, abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA™) , a nd any 
other J&J medicinal product.   
Product Quality Complaint (PQC) 
Any discrete concern that questions the identity, quality, durability, reliability, 
safety, efficacy or intended performance of a drug product. 
A complaint may allege an injury or malfunction associated with the use of the 
dr
ug product.  It may also involve the design, literature, packaging, advertising, 
availability, physical appearance or promotion of the drug product. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the 
view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death,  
 a life-threatening adverse event,  
o Life-threatening adverse event or life-threatening suspected 
adverse reaction .  
 An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered ‘‘life -threatening’’ if, in the view of the 
investigator , its occurrence places the patient or subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in 
a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
 a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions, or  
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 is a suspected transmission of infectious agents by a medicinal product 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medic
al judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.

III. Management of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Special Reporting 
S
ituations 
In general, the investigator must immediately report to the Janssen Services, LLC 
a
ny serious adverse event and Special Reporting Situations, whether or not 
considered drug related.  Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all-
cause mortality) must be reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is 
evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event (e.g., 
de
ath as a result of anaphylactic reaction or fatal hepatic necrosis).  In that case, 
the investigator must immediately report the event to the Janssen Services, LLC.  
The
 investigator  must record non-serious adverse events and report them to the 
Janssen Services, LLC according to the timetable for reporting as specified either 
in the protocol or to fulfill regulatory reporting requirements. 
 
For each subject, AEs, SAEs and Special Reporting Situations should be recorded 
a
fter informed consent is obtained until the subject has completed participation in 
the study as follows: 
 
A Serious Adverse event or Special Reporting Situation must be reported if it 
oc
curs during a subject’s participation in the Study (whether receiving abiraterone 
acetate or not), from the consent signature [CONTACT_107338] [ADDRESS_119284].

the following occurs: 
 -the event resolves or stabilizes; 
 -the event returns to baseline condition or value (if a baseline value is 
available); 
 -the event can be attributed to agents(s) other than the Study Product, or to 
factors unrelated to Study conduct. 
 
IV. Recording of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Special Reporting 
S
ituations 
Recording should be done in a concise manner using standard, acceptable medical 
terms. 
 
The adverse event recorded should not be a procedure or a clinical measurement 
(i.e., a laboratory value or vital sign) but should reflect the reason for the 
procedure or the diagnosis based on the abnormal measurement. 
 
Preexisting conditions that worsen in severity or frequency during the Study 
should also be recorded (a preexisting condition that does not worsen is not an 
adverse event). 
 
Further, a procedure or surgery is not an adverse event; rather, the event leading 
to the procedure or surgery is considered an adverse event.  Any event requiring 
in-pa
tient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107273] a subject’s participation 
in a trial must be reported as an SAE.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107274] 
c
riteria for SAE reporting are: 
A: Reasons described in the Protocol, e.g. drug administration, Protocol-
required testing 
B. Surgery or procedure planned prior to entry into the Study. 
 
If, in the investigator ’s judgment, a clinical ly significant worsening from baseline 
is observed in any laboratory or other test parameter (e.g., electrocardiogram 
(E
CG), angiogram), physical exam finding, or vital sign, a corresponding clinical 
adverse event should be recorded. 
 
If a specific medical diagnosis has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome should 
be recorded as the adverse event, whenever possible.  However, a complete 
de
scription of the signs, symptoms and investigations which led to the diagnosis 
should be provided.  For example, if clinically significant elevations of liver 
func
tion tests are known to be secondary to hepatitis, “hepatitis” and not 
“elevated liver function tests” should be recorded. If the cause is not known, the 
abnormal test or finding should be recorded as an adverse event, using appropriate

Confidential Page 60 of 69 APPENDIX 5 – PROGRESSION AND RESPONSE CRITERIA 
Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new 
international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_107330] (RECIST 1.1 ) Committee.  
Definitions 
Evaluable for toxicity. All participants who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment. 
Evaluable for objective response. Only those participants who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have 
had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These 
participants will have their response classified according to the definitions stated 
below. (Note: Participants who exhibit objective disease progression or die prior 
to the end of cycle [ADDRESS_119288] one (1) 
lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with 
longest diameter >20 millimeters (mm) using conventional techniques (CT, 
MRI, x-ray) or >[ADDRESS_119289] be 
recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Reminder: A lesion in a previously irradiated area is not eligible for 
measurable disease unless there is objective evidence of progression of the 
lesion prior to study enrollment. Lesions in previously irradiated areas must 
be clearly identified as such. 
Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or 
<[ADDRESS_119290] scan), are considered non-measurable disease. 
Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal 
masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered 
non-measurable. 
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per 
organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline. Target 
lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by

target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The 
baseline sum LD will be used as the reference by [CONTACT_44934]. 
Non-target lesions. All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the [ADDRESS_119291] of a treatment. 
Clinical lesions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when 
they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the 
case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler 
to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Chest x-ray. Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]; however, CT 
is preferable. 
Conventional CT and MRI. These techniques should be performed with cuts 
of [ADDRESS_119292], abdomen, and pelvis. Head and neck tumors and 
those of extremities usually require specific protocols. 
Tumor Markers.   
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. Study Outcome 
Measures based on PSA Decline – The following parameters will be 
recorded on a month ly basis.  
 PSA decline will be measured according to PSAWG-2 (2008) criteria. 
 PSA changes will be recorded on all patients. 
 Time to PSA progression (TTP) will be based on revised PSA 
Working Group-2 criteria [ 30].

Response Criteria 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of a ll target lesions. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
LD. 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a  20% increase in the sum of the LD of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions  (new lesions 
must be > slice thickness). 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
LD since the treatment started. 
Unknown (UN): Assessment of target lesions cannot be made due to 
insufficient or unevaluable data. In this case, a concise explanation must be 
given. 
Note : If tumor response data is missing, an overall assessment cannot be 
done. However, if there is missing or unevaluable data for non-target 
lesions, but data is available for all target lesions, the overall response for 
that time point will be assigned based on the sum LD of all target lesions. 
Additi
onally, the assessment of CR cannot be made if there is missing or 
unevaluable data for non-target lesions. In this case, the overall assessment 
would be PR. 
  Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a subject to be considered in complete clinical response 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non-
target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits.

by [CONTACT_107331] (or Protocol Chair). Additionally, the 
cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears 
or worsens during treatment is mandatory to differentiate between stable or 
progressive disease status. 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started). The participant's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

COLLECTION AND HANDLING  
 
PK plasma samples for determination of Abiraterone: 
 
 
1. Materials and Labeling 
 
 
Blood must be collected in Na 2EDTA/NaF containing blood collection tubes. Resulting plasma 
samples must be stored in polypropylene storage tubes with polypropylene or polyethylene caps 
(see Ref.). 
 
No tubes with separation gel should be used 
 
All tubes and containers will be labeled with preprinted labels. The preprinted information will 
include the study number, CRF number, treatment or treatment period, scheduled sampling day 
and time as stipulated in the flow chart, and the analyte name (abiraterone). No other information 
will be written on the labels. 
Labels should be applied to the sample tubes as follows: 
 Apply labels to the sample tubes so that they do not overlap and obscure any information. If 
possible expose an area between the 2 ends of the label to allow viewing of the contents of 
the tube. 
 Do not alter the orientation of the label on the sample tube. 
 Apply labels to all tubes in the same manner.  
 
2. Preparation of Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples 
 
At a timepoint where Abiraterone needs to be determined: 
 
 Collect 2 mL of blood into the appropriate collection tube (e.g. Vacutainer) at each time point. 
It is important to collect full volume. Immediately invert collection tube end-over-end 5 to 10 
times for mixing of the anticoagulant with the blood collected.  
 Following blood collection immediately place the Vacutainer tube in an ice bath until 
centrifugation for collection of plasma. 
 Record the exact date and time of sampling in the CRF, as appropriate. 
 Centrifuge blood samples within 60 minutes of collection in a clinical centrifuge at 1300 g 
(about 2500-3000rpm) for 10 minutes at 4°C to yield approximately 0.7-1.0 mL of plasma 
from each 2 mL whole blood sample. 
 Transfer all separated plasma immediately with a clean, disposable glass or polyethylene 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462] (use a n ew pi[INVESTIGATOR_52356]) to a pre-labeled polypropylene storage tube (See 
ref.).

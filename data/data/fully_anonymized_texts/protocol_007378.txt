PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
PARTICIPANT AREA  DESCRIPTION  
Title  SGLT2 Inhibitor Adjunctive Therapy to Closed Loop Control in T1D  
Investigational Device  Tandem Control- IQ with G6 Continuous Glucose Monitor (CiQ)  
Investigational Medication  Empagliflozin 5 mg daily  
Objectives  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining SGLT2 inhibitors with closed loop control  
Study Design  The study is a randomized control trial where approximately 60 participants will be in the trial for 
approximately 10 weeks. A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_668589] (5) participants will use the Basal- IQ insulin 
therapy + Empagliflozin 10 mg daily. These participants will participate in an estimated 36 -48 hour hotel 
admission to initiate use of Closed Loop Control (CLC) with the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control -IQ 
Technology (CiQ) with Empagliflozin (CiQ -EMPA). The safety data from the hotel admission will be 
presented to the DSMB for review. Upon DSMB approval, up to 40 participants will be randomized 1:1 to 
(a) CiQ x 4 weeks with or without Empagliflozin 5 mg daily (CiQ -EMPA vs. CiQ -NO EMPA) then Basal- IQ x 
2 weeks with or without Empagliflozin  5 mg daily (BiQ -EMPA vs. BiQ -NO EMPA) or (b) Basal- IQ x 2 weeks 
with or without Empagliflozin (BiQ -EMPA vs. BiQ -NO EMPA) then CiQ x 4 weeks with or without 
Empagliflozin (CiQ -EMPA vs. CiQ -NO EMPA)   
Number of Sites  1 
Endpoint  To demonstrate the efficacy of Empagliflozin as adjuvant therapy with Basal- IQ therapy vs a closed loop 
artificial pancreas system (CiQ -EMPA) in patients with T1DM. The primary efficacy outcome variable will 
be time in range (70 -180 mg/dl).

 Chapter 1:  Background  [ADDRESS_902976] been 118 
used/considered in AP systems to improve prandial control include a) hybrid system that requires 119 
the patient to announce meals by [CONTACT_668607]; b) system with meal 120 
announcement that is partially or completely indepe ndent of meal carbohydrate content, and c) [ADDRESS_902977] for optimal glucose 124 
control. While meal carbohydrate content is the major factor for prandial glucose excursions, 125 
precise determination of meal carbohydrate content (that is associated with better glycemic 126 
control and lower glucose variability) during free living remains a significant challenge for the 127 
patients with an average error in carbohydrate counting of ~20% with most patients [ADDRESS_902978] mostly been in small number of patients and 131 
in the in -patient settings for short durations  [1, 2]. These trials have demonstrated significant [ADDRESS_902979] been tried in very short -term inpatient trials include pramlintide (amylin 137 
analogue that delays gastric emptying and lowers postprandial glucagon concentrations) [3-5] 138 
and Glucagon- like-peptide 1 receptor analogues (delays gastric emptying and lowers  139 
postprandial glucagon concentrations) and GLP -1 receptor agonists [6]. These studies have [ADDRESS_902980] improvements in CGM parameters (time in range and glucose variability) [ADDRESS_902981] demonstrated clinically significant improvements in glucose 145 
control (viz., HbA1c) and cardiovascular events [7]. While not FDA approved for use in adults with [ADDRESS_902982] also been tested in randomized controlled clinical 147 
trials in these patients to evaluate their safety and efficacy. The EASE program [8] included two 148

CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 18 of 72 
 double -blind, placebo -controlled  phase 3 trials in > 1700 patients with T1DM. These trials tested 149 
2.5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg tablets vs. placebo over 26 -52 weeks. The results showed that 150 
Empagliflozin lowered HbA1c, lowered total daily dose of insulin (by 10 -13%) while increasing 151 
time in range (by [CONTACT_8622] 12%) without any increase in the frequency or severity of hypoglycemia. 152 
Simultaneously, there were improvements in body weight (by [CONTACT_8622] 3.5 Kg), blood pressure and 153 
glucose variability.  154 
However, adverse effects pertaining to genital infections, diabetic ketoacidosis, and ketosis  155 
without acidosis were between 2 -3 fold higher with Empagliflozin than placebo. Due to the 156 
glycosuric effects of this class of drugs, it is noteworthy that the characteristic hyperglycemic 157 
milieu often seen during classical epi[INVESTIGATOR_668592] -acidosis are not observed in 158 
ketoacidosis related to S GLT2 drug use where the ambient glucose concentrations are frequently 159 
< 250 mg/dl. This observation has prompted the creation of the condition of “euglycemic diabetic 160 
keto -acidosis” associated with SGLT2 drug use. Risks for development of ketosis were deem ed to 161 
be due to concomitant illnesses (viral infections, gastro -enteritis), insulin pump failure, alcohol 162 
excess, extreme/endurance sports and low carbohydrate diet (< 100 grams/day). Suggestions for 163 
prevention of ketosis in patients on SGLT2 inhibitor the rapy are to avoid use of this class of drugs 164 
in those with HbA1c > 9%, temporary drug discontinuation for 24 -48 prior to planned surgery, 165 
fasting, intercurrent illnesses or prolonged physical activity, early recognition of symptoms of 166 
ketosis (malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, excess thirst), regular point of care ketone 167 
monitoring (6 -12 hourly) especially if glucose > 9mmol. The putative STICH protocol has recently 168 
been recommended for management of diabetic ketoacidosis associated with use of SGL T2 169 
inhibitor therapy [9]. This includes  STop drug, Inject bolus insulin (1.5 times the usual correction 170 
bolus), Consume 30 -60 grams of carbohydrate and Hydrate with 200-500 ml of fluids . The above 171 
sequence needs to be repeated every 1-2 hours with recheck of ketones in 2-4 hour s. Medical 172 
attention should be  sought if any of the steps cannot be followed, particularly if fluids cannot be 173 
maintained or if ketonemia does not resolve within 4 -6 hours.   174 
The increased risk of ketosis and DKA in SGLT2 users with T1DM may not preclude use of this 175 
class of drugs for the management of T1DM given their clinical benefits in RCTs in T1DM patients 176 
(described above) and the cardiovascular benefits in T2DM patients. As always, careful patient [ADDRESS_902983] been tested in short term clinical trials in T1DM. The drugs tested include pramlintide and 182 
GLP-1 receptor agonists [6]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published clinical trials [ADDRESS_902984] to 184

 the above trials, where both pramlintide and GLP -1 agonists need to be infused or injected, 185 
Empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, is taken as a once daily oral tablet making it simple, practical 186 
and not burdensome for patient adherence. Additionally, given its proven benefits on glucose 187 
control in several large RCTs involving >[ADDRESS_902985] its efficacy 188 
and safety, in combination with automated insulin delivery systems, in T1DM subjects as part of 189 
a clinical trial that we propose. Additionally, albeit the increased prevalence of ketosis with 190 
empagliflozin use in the published trials, given the accumulated clinical information and 191 
experienc e, we will ensure that appropriate precautions including judicious selection of research 192 
participants (HbA1c of 9% as cutoff for enrollment), educating subjects on avoiding 193 
circumstances that could predispose to ketosis (intercurrent illnesses, alcohol excess, low carb 194 
diet etc) and careful monitoring, will prevent and further lower the risks of ketosis during the 195 
proposed, short term clinical trial.  196

 885 
The Diabetes Distress Scale  [12] is a measure of diabetes -related emotional distress and consists 886 
of a scale of 28 items. These include 7 items from each of four domains central to diabetes -related 887 
emotional distress. Patients rate the degree to which each item is currently problematic for t hem 888 
on a 6 -point Likert scale, from 1 (no problem) to 6 (serious problem).  889 
Administration time is approximately 5 minutes.  890 
 
 891 
The Hypoglycemia Fear Survey -II [13] was developed to measure behaviors and worries related 892 
to fear of hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. It is composed of 2 subscales, the Behavior 893 
(HFS -B) and Worry (HFS -W). HFS -B items describe behaviors in which patients may engage to 894 
avoid hypog lycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_49591]/or their negative consequences (e.g., keepi[INVESTIGATOR_668601] 895 
levels higher, making sure other people are around, and limiting exercise or physical activity). [ADDRESS_903055] about their hypo glycemic 897 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (e.g., being alone, epi[INVESTIGATOR_251249], or having an accident). Items are 898 
rated on a 5 -point Likert scale (0=never, 4=always), with higher scores indicating higher fear of 899 
hypoglycemia.  900 
Administration time is approximately 10 minutes (both versions).  901 
 Control -IQ / Basal -IQ Survey Technology Acceptance  902 
The Technology Acceptance Surveys  [14] were developed for a Bionic Pancreas camp study. The 903 
38 items in the Questionnaire were based on interviews conducted with individuals who had 904 
participated in previous Bionic Pancreas trials about their experience regarding the Bionic 905 
Pancreas. It was subsequently adapted to assess these same measures for the inControl closed- 906 
loop system. It assesses both positive and negative experiences with inControl, including blood 907 
glucose management, device burden, and overall satisfaction. Items were rated on a 5 -point 908

 Chapter 12  Risks Associated with Clinical Trial  911 
 
 912 
Risks and Benefits are detailed below. Loss of confidentiality is a potential risk; however, data are 913 
handled to minimize this risk.  Hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and ketone formation are always a 914 
risk in participants with type 1 diabetes and participants will be monitored for these symptoms.  915 
 Venipuncture Risks  916 
A hollow needle/plastic tube will be placed in the arm for taking blood samples. Blood draws can [ADDRESS_903056] for several weeks.  The 925 
risk of local infection is less than 1 in 1000.  This should not be a significant contributor to risks in 926 
this study as finger sticks are part of the usual care for people with diabetes.  927 
 Subcutaneous Catheter Risks  (CGM)  928 
Participants using the CGM will be at low risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a local skin infection at the site of 929 
the sensor needle placement.  If a catheter is left under the skin for more than 24 hours it is 930 
possible to get an infection where it goes into the skin, with swelling, redness and pain.  There 931 
may be bleeding where the catheter is put in and bleeding under the skin causes a bruise (1 in 10 932

the insertion site.  The participant should be further instructed to notify the study coordinator 936 
immediately if this occurs.  937 
 Risks of Hypoglycemia  938 
As with any person having type 1 diabetes and using insulin, there is always a risk of having a low 939 
blood sugar (hypoglycemia).  The frequency of hypoglycemia should be no more and possibly less [ADDRESS_903058] as at home, there is the possibility of fainting or seizures 942

The study CGM system is labeled for single use only. The sensor (the component of the system 956 
that enters the skin) will be single use only. The transmitter and receiver may be reused during 957 
the study after cleaning the device using a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -approved cleaning procedure. The transmitter 958

 Device Cleaning Instructions  967 
CGM cleaning instructions are provided in the Dexcom G4 PLATINUM (Professional) Cleaning and 968 
Disinfection manual (current edition). The transmitter should be cleaned with Clorox Healthcare® [ADDRESS_903060] with EPA 976 
registration number [ZIP_CODE] -7 using similar procedures as the cleaning process .   977 
Per the pump manufacturer, the insulin pump will be cleaned with a damp lint -free cloth. Use of 978 
household or industrial cleaners, solvents, bleach, scouring pads, chemicals, or sharp instruments 979 
are prohibited. The pump should never be submerged in water. If needed, use only a very mild 980 
detergent, such as a bit of liquid soap with warm water. A soft towel will be used to dry the pump.  981 
The Bayer Contour Next glucometer is cleaned and disinfected with two separate Super Sani - 982 
Cloths (EPA number 9480- 4). The entire surface will be cleaned, making sure the surface stays 983 
wet for 2 minutes. This step is repeated with a clean cloth for disinfecting the device.  984 
The Precision Xtra User’s Guide suggests that healthcare professionals use 10% bleach, 70% 985 
alcohol or 10% ammonia to clean the device.  [ADDRESS_903061] skin will be cleaned with ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (70 -90%), 987 
quaternary ammonium germicidal detergent (i.e. Cavicide, EPA number [ZIP_CODE]) or household [ADDRESS_903062] time on the surface depends on the method used to clean the equipment. 989 
Cavicide requires three minutes on the surface of the equipment. Clorox Germicidal Bleach Wipes 990 
require two minutes on the equipment. The surface should remain wet (i.e. slightly damp) with [ADDRESS_903063] current recommendations.  994 
There is the risk of blood sampling collection and contamination from sampling techniques. Hand 995 
washing with either soap & water or waterless hand sanitizer will be used prior to caring for the [ADDRESS_903064]’s protection (i.e. hand washing, 998 
changing gloves frequently, disposing needles properly). Gloves will be removed and hands [ADDRESS_903065]’s room. Soiled linen will be 1000 
changed to minimize the transfer of pathogenic organisms.  1001 
 Hb1Ac Risk  1002 
An NGSP Point of Care analyzer (i.e. DCA Vantage Analyzer) will be utilized at the research site to [ADDRESS_903066]’s HbA1c level.  1004 
 Other Risks  1005 
Some participants may develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the adhesives used to secure 1006 
the CGM, or to secure the insulin infusion sets for the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.  1007 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 52 of 72 
 If these r eactions occur, different adhesives or “under -tapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” (such as with IV 3000, Tegaderm, 1008 
etc.) will be tried, sites will be rotated frequently, and a mild topi[INVESTIGATOR_91101] 1009 
medication may be required.  1010 
Whenever the skin is broken there is the possibility of an infection.  The CGM and pump infusion 1011 
sites are inserted under the skin.  It is possible that any part that is inserted under the skin may 1012 
cause an infection.  These occur very infrequently, but, if an infection was to occur, oral and/or 1013 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_27996].  The risk of skin problems could be greater if you use a sensor for 1014 
longer than it is supposed to be used.  Therefore, participants will be carefully instructed about 1015 
proper use of the sensor.  1016 
Data downloaded from the CGM, pump, and glucose and ketone meter , if accessible,  will be 1017 
collected for the study as measures of diabetes self- management behaviors.  Some people 1018 
may  be uncomfortable with the researchers' having such detailed information about their daily 1019 
diabetes habits.  1020 
 Known Potential Benefits  1021 
It is expected that this protocol will yield increased knowledge about using an automated 1022 
closed -loop system with anticipatory action to control glucose levels.  The individual participant 1023 
may not benefit from study participation.  1024 
 Risk Assessment  1025 
Based on the facts that (1) adults and adolescents with diabetes experience mild hypoglycemia 1026 
and hyperglycemia frequently as a consequence of the disease and its management, (2) the study 1027 
intervention involves periodic automated insulin do sing that may increase the likelihood of 1028 
hypoglycemia, and periodic automated attenuation of insulin delivery that may increase the 1029 
likelihood of hyperglycemia, (3) mitigations are in place, and have been tested in prior studies 1030 
using the investigational device system in the home setting, that limit the likelihood of excessive 1031 
insulin dosing or prolonged withdrawal of insulin, and (4) rapid reversal of hypoglycemia and [ADDRESS_903067] 1039

 Device Complaints and Malfunctions  1095 
A device complication or complaint is something that happens to a device or related to device 1096 
performance, whereas an adverse event happen s to a participant.  A device complaint may occur 1097 
independently from an AE, or along with an AE.  An AE may occur without a device complaint or 1098 
there may be an AE related to a device complaint.  A device malfunction is any failure of a device 1099

other means —will be reported on an adverse event form online.  Each adverse event form is [ADDRESS_903085] ency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators should apply the 1154 
following general guideline when determining whether an adverse event is related:  1155 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and the 1156 
study intervention, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_2299]’s 1157 
clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the adverse event follows 1158 
a known pattern of response to the study intervention; and/or the adverse ev ent abates or 1159 
resolves upon discontinuation of the study intervention or dose reduction and, if applicable, 1160 
reappears upon re -challenge.  1161 
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study intervention (e.g., 1162 
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 1163 
medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to study 1164 
intervention.  1165 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 57 of 72 
 
 
 1166 
The intensity of an adverse  event will be rated on a three -point  scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or 1167 
(3) severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus, a severe adverse 1168 
event is not necessarily serious.  For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, 1169 
but may not be clinically serious.  1170 
MILD: Usually transient, requires no special treatment, and does not interfere with the 1171 
participant’s daily activities.  1172 
MODERATE: Usually causes a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may 1173 
interfere with daily activities,  but is usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].  1174 
SEVERE: Interrupts a participant’s usual daily activities and generally requires systemic drug 1175 
therapy or other treatment.  1176 
 
 1177 
Adverse events will be coded per the UVA IRB web site instructions (i.e. mild, moderate, severe).   1178 
The DSMB  will review the investigator’s assessment of causality and may agree or disagree.  Both 1179 
the investigator’s and DSMB ’s assessments will be recorded.  The DSMB  will have the final say in 1180 
determining the causality.  1181 
Adverse events that continue after the participant’s discontinuation or completion of the study 1182 
will be followed until their medical outcome is determined or until no further change in the 1183 
condition is expected.  1184 
 
 1185 
The outcome of each reportable adverse event will be classified by [CONTACT_3470]:  1186 
RECOVERED/RESOLVED – The participant recovered from the AE/SAE without sequelae.  Record 1187 
the AE/SAE stop date.  1188 
RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE – The event persisted and had stabilized without [ADDRESS_903086] the AE/SAE stop date.  1190 
FATAL – A fatal outcome is defined as the SAE that resulted in death.  Only the event that was 1191 
the cause of death should be reported as fatal.  AEs/SAEs that were ongoing at the time of 1192 
death; however, were not the cause of death, will be recorded as “resolved” at the time of 1193 
death.  1194 
NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED (ONGOING) – An ongoing AE/SAE is defined as the event was 1195 
ongoing with an undetermined outcome.  1196 
An ongoing outcome will require follow -up by [CONTACT_66713] 1197 
of the AE/SAE.  1198 
The outcome of an ongoing event at the time of death that was not the cause of death, will be 1199 
updated and recorded as “resolved” with the date of death recorded as the stop date.  1200 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 58 of 72 
 UNKNOWN – An unknown outcome is defined as an inability to access the participant or the 1201 
participant’s records to determine the outcome (for example, a participant that was lost to 1202 
follow -up). 1203 
All clinically significant abnormalities of clinical laboratory measurements or adverse events 1204 
occurring during the study and continuing at study termination should be followed by [CONTACT_941] 1205 
participant’s physician and evaluated with additional tests (if necessary) until diagnosis of the [ADDRESS_903087] the participant until the adverse  event has resolved or stabilized.  1213 
 
 1214 
All UADEs, ADEs, device complaints, and device malfunctions will be reported irrespective of 1215 
whether an adverse event occurred, except in the following circumstances.  1216 
The following device issues are anticipated and will not be reported but will reported as an 1217 
Adverse Event if the criteria for AE reporting described above are met:  1218 
Component disconnections  1219 
CGM sensors lasting fewer than the number of days expected per CGM labeling  1220 
CGM tape adherence issues  1221 
Pump infusion set occlusion not leading to ketosis  1222 
Battery lifespan deficiency due to inadequate charging or extensive wireless communication  1223 
Intermittent device component disconnections/communication failures not leading to system [ADDRESS_903088].  1232

 1245 
 Participant Discontinuation  1246 
Rules for discontinuing study device use are described below.  1247 
The investigator believes it is unsafe for the participant to continue on the intervention.  This 1248 
could be due to the development of a new medical condition or worsening of an existing 1249 
condition; or participant behavior contrary to the indications for use of the device that 1250 
imposes on the participant’s safety  [ADDRESS_903090] severe hypoglycemia events as defined in section 13.2.1. 1255 
 Suspending/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3396]  1256 
In the case of an unanticipated system malfunction resulting in a severe hypoglycemia or severe 1257 
hyperglycemia event (as defined in section 13.2 ), use of the study device system will be 1258 
suspended while the problem is diagnosed.  1259 
In addition, study activities could be similarly suspended if the manufacturer of any constituent 1260 
study device requires stoppage of device use for safety reasons (e.g. product recall).  The affected 1261 
study activities may resume if the underlying problem can be corrected by a protocol or system 1262 
modification that will not invalidate the  results obtained prior to suspension. The study Medical 1263 
Monitor will review all adverse events and adverse device events that are reported during the 1264 
study and will review compi[INVESTIGATOR_27985] (generally timed to the review of 1265 
compi[INVESTIGATOR_418081]). The DSMB  may request suspension of study activities or 1266 
stoppage of the study if deemed necessary based on the totality of safety data available.  1267 
In the event that two subjects experience urosepsis, AKI, fournier’s gangrene, severe genital 1268 
mycotic infections and hypotension requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], t he study will be paused to discuss 1269

 Chapter 15  Statistical Consideration  1294 
 
 1295 
As presented in Figure 1, this study uses a randomized controlled design, with participants 1296 
randomly assigned to four groups as follows : 1297 
a. Groups 1 and 2 are assigned to Experimental condition – use of SGLT2 inhibitor 1298 
(Empagliflozin) plus technology  (CGM, Basal IQ or Control IQ) 1299 
b. Groups 3 and 4 are assigned to Control condition – no use of SGLT2 inhibitors; 1300 
use of technology onl y (CGM, Basal IQ or Control IQ) 1301 
All four groups participate in a 1 -2 week baseline CGM sessions, after which Groups 1 and 3 begin 1302 
use of Control IQ, while Groups 2 and 4 begin use of Basal IQ. After using Control IQ or Basal IQ 1303 
for 4 or 2 weeks, respectively, all groups switch to use of the alternative technology (Figure 1).  [ADDRESS_903093] size of the outcomes listed below. 1306 
Nevertheless, the projected sample size  of N=40 (N= 60 recruited) participants is expected to 1307 
results in statistically significant differences on some outcomes:  1308 
Primary Outcome:  CGM -measured time in the target range 70 -180mg/dl (TIR) during the day;  1309 
Hierarchical secondary outcomes:  24/7 CGM tim e in range <70mg/dl; 24/7 CGM -measured 1310 
average glucose; CGM -measured glucose variability (coefficient of variation, CV) during the day; 1311 
risks for hypo - and hyperglycemia.  1312 
Analysis Overview:  The overall analysis will follow Intention -to-treat (ITT) approach, with each 1313 
participant analyzed according to the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_668612]. The study 1314 
design includes repeated measures on all outcomes; thus, we will use a linear mixed -effect model 1315 
that corresponds well to this structure. The mixed model will use “Subject” as a random factor 1316 
and “Group” as a fixed factor, e.g. using the Linear Mixed Models procedure in SPSS. We should 1317 
note that similar results may be generated by [CONTACT_93739], but mixed models 1318 
handle missing data better (e.g.  ANOVA only uses listwise deletion, which could reduce power 1319 
and introduce bias towards study completers). A mixed model is also more flexible and will allow 1320 
us to address additional questions, such as clustering of subjects or introducing time between 1321 
assessments as a continuous variable.  1322 
Data Sources:  Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data acquired every 5 minutes during the 1323 
baseline and throughout the study. CGM data will be used to compute established metrics of 1324 
glycemic control (e.g. time in ranges), risks for hypo - and hyperglycemia, e.g. the Low and High 1325 
BG Indices (LBGI/HBGI), and CV, as recommended by [CONTACT_668613], to which our 1326 
team contributed substantially.  1327 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 63 of 72 
 Handling of Missing Data:  All randomized participants who have at least 5 0% of their CGM 1328 
readings during the study period will be included in the analysis. Occasional missing CGM data 1329 
do occur during normal CGM use and these values will be ignored when summary CGM metrics 1330 
(e.g. percent times in range, LBGI, HBGI) are computed. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], CGM data are voluminous and 1331 
the percent of missing values is low; thus no imputation would be required. For example, in the 1332 
recently completed multi -center Protocol 3 of the International Diabetes Closed Loop Trial, 1333 
N=168 subjects (of N=168 recr uited) completed the entire 6 -month protocol, and CGM data were 1334 
available 96% of the time [15] (Table 1 ).  1335 
Safety outcomes  will be reported for all enrolled participants, irrespective of whether the 1336 
subjects were randomized or the study was completed.  1337 
Data Analysis:  The objectives of this study are addressed  by [CONTACT_668614]- analyses of our general 1338 
analytical scheme, as follows:   1339 
Objective 1:  Effect of adding Empagliflozin to predictive low glucose suspend (Basal IQ – 2 1340 
weeks) and closed -loop control (Control IQ – 4 weeks) will be assessed by [CONTACT_1758] 1341 
randomized design (Figure 1). In this design we will have N=20 participants on Empagliflozin 1342 
and N=20 participants off Empagliflozin, beginning with Control IQ and then switching to 1343 
Basal IQ, or beginning with Basal IQ and then switching to Control  IQ. This analysis will be 1344 
done using the baseline data as covariates in a general linear model.  1345 
Objective 2:  CGM -measured effect of Empagliflozin will be assessed using the baseline CGM 1346 
data, (between Visits 2 and 3) via direct contrast between the two Experimental and two 1347 
Control groups (N=20 participants in Groups 1 -2 vs 20 participants in Groups 3 -4); 1348 
Objective 3:  CGM -measured effects of Empagliflozin added to Basal IQ will be assessed by [ADDRESS_903094] comparison of the Experimental vs Control groups during th e Basal IQ sessions (N=20 1350 
participants per arm will be available to this analysis);  1351 
Objective 4:  CGM -measured effects of Empagliflozin added to Control IQ will be assessed [ADDRESS_903095] comparison of the Experimental vs Control groups during the Control IQ ses sions 1353 
(N=20 participants per arm will be available to this analysis);  1354 
To preserve the overall type 1 error, a hierarchical testing procedure will be used: if the primary 1355 
analysis for CGM -measured TIR 70 -180mg/dL during the day is statistically significant (p < 0.05), 1356 
then testing will proceed to the next outcome metric in the following order: CGM- measured 24/7 1357 
percent time <70mg/dL; CGM -measured average glucose; CGM -measured CV during the day; [ADDRESS_903096] 1359 
until a non- significant result (p ≥ 0.05) is observed, or all variables have been tested. If a non - [ADDRESS_903097] become exploratory.  1362

 1363 
Sample Size Determination  is based on data from our Protocol 3 of the recently completed iDCL 1364 
Trial (Table 1) conducted with the same algorithm in the same population. The Pre -Post changes [ADDRESS_903098] size of >0.[ADDRESS_903099] of Basal IQ and Control IQ during the day and will preserve their benefits 1368 
overnight. This, a 1:1 randomization into two Experimental vs.  two Control groups  and N=20 1369 
participants per study arm, yields a sample size on N=40 subjects to complete the study. This 1370 
sample size was computed using the G*Power 3 software under the assumptions of power=90% 1371 
and type 1 error α=0.01,  further reinforcing the feasibility of the hierarchical analyses  described 1372 
above. In our experience with long -term AP studies, we observe attrition rate of 20%, with most 1373 
dropouts occurring during the baseline prior to randomization. Thus, the recruitment  sample size 1374 
was increased to N= 60 to accommodate up to 20% attrition rate without sacrificing statistical 1375 
power. We should also note that technology improvement appears to increase the retention rate 1376 
in recent large -scale trials. For example, it the iDCL protocol 3, only 2 out of 170 recruited 1377 
participants dropped out and all 168 randomized participants completed the 6 -month study.  1378

 Rationale for sample size determination: Use of Empagliflozin could potentially ‘double the [ADDRESS_903103]’ of Basal -IQ and Control IQ during the day by [CONTACT_668615] [ADDRESS_903104] demonstrated reduced hepatic glycogen synthesis resulting in 1437 
reduced net hepatic glycogen content in poorly controlled T1D compared to 1438 
nondiabetic controls [16]. In contrast, in well controlled T1DM subjects, initial 1439 
splanchnic glucose uptake was not reduced when compared to matched 1440 
nondiabetic controls [17]. Taken together, assuming usual daily carbohydrate 1441 
intake of ~ 180 grams (i. e., 60 grams per main meal) in an adult with T1DM, and a 1442 
net splanchnic extraction of ingested carbohydrates of ~ 25% [17], ~ 75% of 1443 
ingested carbohydrates (~ 135 grams) would appear daily into the circulation. 1444 
Given a relatively conservative estimate that ~ half the ingested carbohydrates 1445 
are taken up by [CONTACT_668616], that leaves ~ 70 gram s of ingested 1446 
carbohydrates/day to contribute to postprandial glucose excursions.   1447 
b. Based on data obtained from the prescribing information of Empagliflozin that 10 1448 
mg of Empagliflozin results in net urinary loss of 64 grams of glucose per day [18], [ADDRESS_903105] “double the effects” of lowering postprandial glucose 1451 
concentrati ons in this clinical trial.    1452

 Chapter 16   Data Collection and Monitoring  1453 
 
 1454 
The study data are collected through a combination of case report forms (electronic and paper) [ADDRESS_903106].  These documents should 1466 
be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427].  No records will be 1467 
destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable.  It is the responsibility of the 1468 
sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  1469 
 
 1470 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practices 1471 
(GCP), or procedure requirements.  The noncompliance may be either on the part of the 1472 
participant, the investigator, or the study site staff.  As a result of deviations, corrective actions 1473 
may be developed by [CONTACT_91123].  Major deviations will be reported 1474 
to the IRB -HSR within 7 calendar days of when the study team bec omes aware of the event.   1475

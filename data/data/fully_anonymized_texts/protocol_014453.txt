CR-[ADDRESS_392017] lens used in this study has a new ultraviolet (UV)-blocking additive.  The 
additive darkens to a gray-indigo hue when exposed to UV and/or  high energy visible (HEV) 
light in a dose-dependent manner.  The additive reverses back to  a clear state when UV/HEV 
light is no longer present. 
In 2015, approximately 76% of adu lt Americans use some form of vision correction.  Among 
these, only about 40% wear contact [CONTACT_13276].  This study will eva luate the acceptance of the 
Test lens on a population of subj ects that do not wear contact [CONTACT_13276].[ADDRESS_392018] article will be worn  bilaterally in daily wear (DW),
reusable modality for at least five days per week and six hours per day for approximately one 
month.  The lenses will be repla ced after approximately two wee ks.

3.4. Enrollment Strategy
Study subjects will be recruited from the Institution/clinical site’s subject database and/or 
utilizing Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional R eview Board (IRB) approved 
materials. 
4. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE
4.1. Description of Study Design
This is a 5-visit, multi-site, single-arm dispensing trial. App roximately 135 subjects will be 
screened and enrolled to ensure  that 100 subjects complete.  
The study begins with an initial Visit 1 (Day 0). If a subject is found to meet all eligibility 
criteria, they will be enrolled into the study. Subjects will w ear the Test contact [CONTACT_224029] a 
bilateral fashion as DW, reusable format for approximately 4-wee ks.  After the 4-week 
follow-up visit (Visit 4), subjects will wear their habitual sp ectacles for a period of 1-week.
If a subject is dispensed the study lens at the initial visit, [ADDRESS_392024] lens wearers (neoph ytes), the study lens is worn 
for a total period of 4-weeks to allow a 2-week adaptation peri od. After 4-weeks of contact 
[CONTACT_13279], subjects will return to their habitual spectacles fo r 1-week. Returning to their 
habitual spectacles will allow subjects to be able to make comp arisons between the study 
lenses and their spectacles. 
4.3. Enrollment Target and Study Duration
Approximately [ADDRESS_392025] lens wearers (neophytes) are targ eted to be enrolled with a 
target of [ADDRESS_392026] visi t. All subjects will be 18 to 39 
(inclusive) years old. Subjects will wear the study lens for a total period of 4-weeks, and 
[ADDRESS_392027] Article Allocation 
This is a single-arm study; therefore, all eligible subjects wi ll be assigned the Test lens in a 
bilateral fashion.  
CR-[ADDRESS_392028] and determine the r eason for discontinuation/withdr awal.  The measures taken to 
follow up must be documented including two written attempts and  a certified letter (or 
equivalent) as the final attempt. 
9. PRE-STUDY AND CONCOMITANT I NTERVENTION/MEDICATION
Concomitant medications will be documented during screening and  updated during the study.  
Disallowed medications for this study include: any ocular topic al medication and systemic 
medication that have a higher likelihood of affecting the tear film.  See Section 3.3.
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35443]: see Section 3.3.
10. DEVIATIONS FROM THE PROTOCOL
Investigator will notify study sponsor upon identification of a  protocol deviation. Major 
protocol deviations must be repor ted to the sponsor within 24 h ours after discovery of the 
protocol deviation.  The Investigator will report deviations pe r IRB/IEC requirements.  All 
deviations will be tr acked and corrective ac tions implemented a s appropriate.  
If it becomes necessary for the Investigator to implement a dev iation in order to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the trial subject, the Investigator may imp lement the deviation 
immediately without notificati on to the sponsor. Within 24 hour s after the implemented 
deviation, the Investigator mus t notify and provide the rationa le to the Sponsor and, as 
required, the IEC/IRB.  
11. STUDY TERMINATION
The occurrence of one or more Unanticipated Serious Adverse Dev ice Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE), or 
any SAE where the relationship to study agent cannot be ruled o ut, may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35446].  In the event of a [LOCATION_003]DE or  SAE, the Sponsor may unmask 
the treatment regimen f or the subject(s) and will discuss this with the Investigator before any 
further subjects are enrolled. 
The Sponsor will determine whe n a study will be stopped.  The P rincipal Investigator always 
has the discretion to initiate s toppi[INVESTIGATOR_171167]’s res ults are compromised.
JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason.  Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreaso nable risk is determined.  The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_171168], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a di scussion with JJVC, it is determined 
that it would be unwise to con tinue at the clinical site.   
CR-6241 v2.0      Page 41 of 109 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events.  If it is 
determined that an adverse even t presents an unreasonable risk,  the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated, a s soon as possible. 
Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as schedu led), the Investigator will 
notify the IEC/IRB and Regulato ry Authority as required by [CONTACT_19566] l regulatory requirements.
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC ) refers to any written, electr onic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, dur ability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have b een released for clinical trial use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources includi ng but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations manager s (COM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc . The following are not considered produ ct quality complaints: 
xSubject satisfaction inquiries reported via “Subjective Questio nnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO)” 
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged af ter receipt at the 
investigational site
xLens replacements that occur due to drops/fall-outs 
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_171188] h andling by [CONTACT_28024], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, e tc.), only in situations where 
there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_171189] [ADDRESS_392029] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic ema il notification to the 
appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases wh ere the EDC system in 
use is not configured to send aut omatic notifica tions or when a n EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery  that a PQC has occurred.  
Upon receipt of the EDC notifi cation, the COM/CRA will contact [CONTACT_318498]:
xDate the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Dat e of Sponsor 
Awareness)
xWho received the complaint 
xStudy number 
xClinical site information (cont act name, site ID, telephone num ber) 
xLot number(s) 
xUnique Subject Identifier(s) 
xIndication of who first observed c omplaint (site personnel or s ubject) 
xOD/OS indication, along with whe ther the lens was inserted
xAny related AE number if applicable
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, we ar time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.) 
CR-6241 v2.0      Page 42 of 109 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
xEye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable
xConfirmation of produc t availability for return (and tracking i nformation, if available), 
or rationale if product is not a vailable for return (Refer to 
for test article r eturn instructions)
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], C RA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event (AE /SAE).  If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/ CRA, or trained site personnel wi ll follow Section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was pot entially the result of a product  quality related deficiency, 
these procedures also applies  and will be execu ted in parallel.   
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_779] i n error.  In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must 
be documented. 
13. ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1. Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical  occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs  (including abnormal laborato ry findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not r elated to the investigational  medical device.  
Note 1  to entry: This definition include s events related to the inves tigational medical device 
or the comparator. 
Note 2  to entry: This definition include s events related to the proce dures involved. 
Note 3 to entry: For users or other pe rsons, this definition is restri cted to events related to 
investigational medical devices.”1
An AE includes any condition (including a pre-existing conditio n) that:
1. Was not present prior to the study, but appeared or reappeare d following initiation of 
the study  
2. Was present prior to the study, but worsened during the study . This would include any 
condition resulting from concomitant illnesses, reactions to co ncomitant medications, 
or progression of disease states  
3. Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse event and must be reported to the 
clinical monitor and to the Spons or immediately upon learning o f the event 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:
xResults in death
xIs life threatening
xRequires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318492]/incapacity (e.g ., a sight threatening event, 
a significant persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage , or disruption to the 
subject’s body)
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or
xRequires intervention to prevent p ermanent damage (the use of t he test article resulting 
in a condition which requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent 
CR-6241 v2.0      Page 43 of 109 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
impairment of the body structure or a body function).  Importan t medical events that 
may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospit alization may be 
considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment , they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject  and may require medical or su rgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition 
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Serious Adv erse Events include, but not 
limited to:
xMicrobial Keratitis (MK)
xIritis (including cells in the anterior chamber)
xPermanent decrease in best spect acle corrected visual acuity eq uivalent to 2 acuity 
lines or greater
xCentral Corneal Opacity
xCentral Corneal Neovascularization
xUveitis
xEndophthalmitis 
xHypopyon 
xHyphemia
xPenetration of Bow man’s Membrane 
xPersistent Epi[INVESTIGATOR_35449]  – Those events that are usually symptomatic and warrant 
discontinuation (temporary or permanent) of the test article (ex cluding Serious Adverse 
Events).   Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Significant  Adverse Events include, but 
not limited to the following:
xContact [CONTACT_19571] (CLPU) 
xSignificant Infiltrative Events (SIE)
xSuperior Epi[INVESTIGATOR_32955] (SEALs)
xAny Temporary Loss of >[ADDRESS_392030] lens related corneal  events - e.g. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_19533] (EKC) 
xAsymptomatic Corneal Scar
xAny corneal event which necessitates temporary lens discontinua tion >2 weeks
Non-Significant Adverse Events  – Those conditions that are usually asymptomatic and 
usually do not warrant disconti nuation (temporary or permanent)  of the test article.  However, 
the Investigator may choose to t reat as a precautionary measure .  
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Non-Signifi cant Adverse Events include, 
but not limited to the following:
xNon-significant Infiltrative Event (NSIE)
xContact [CONTACT_19573][INVESTIGATOR_19534] (CLPC)
xSuperficial Punctate Keratitis (SPK)
xConjunctivitis: Bacterial, Viral, Allergic
CR-[ADDRESS_392031] Dermatitis
xLocalized Allergic Reactions
xAny corneal event not explicitly defined as serious or signific ant adverse event, which 
necessitates temporary le ns discontinuation <[ADDRESS_392032] (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.
Note 1 to entry: This definition include s adverse events resulting fro m insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use , deployment, implantation, inst allation, or opera tion, or any 
malfunction of the investiga tional medical device.
Note 2  to entry: This definition includes any event resulting from us e error or from 
intentional misuse of the inve stigational medical device.”[ADDRESS_392033] (UADE) – Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or a ssociated with, the test article, 
if that effect, problem, or death w as not previously identified  in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety 
and welfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to 
ensure the events are categori zed correctly.  Elements of categ orization will include:
xSeriousness/Classifications ( see definition in Section 13.1) 
xCausality or Relatedness – i.e. the relationship between the tes t article, study treatment 
or study procedures and the adverse event (not related; unlikel y related; possibly
related; related - see  definition in Section 13.2.1) 
xAdverse Event Severity – Adverse event severity is used to asses s the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild; moderate; severe for all events - see definition in 
Section 13.2.2)
xOutcome – not recovered or not res olved; recovering or resolving; recovered or 
resolved with sequelae; recovered or resolved; death related to a dverse event;
unknown 
xActions Taken – none; temporarily  discontinued; permanently dis continued; other 
13.2.1. Causality Assessment
Causality Assessment – A determination of t he relationship between an adverse event and 
the test article. The test article relationship for each advers e event should be determined by 
[CONTACT_32981]: 
xNot Related- An adverse event that is not related to the use of  the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures 
CR-6241 v2.0      Page 45 of 109 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
xUnlikely Related – An adverse event for which an alternative exp lanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely 
xPossibly Related – An adverse eve nt that might be due to the us e of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative expl anation, e.g. 
concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive.   The relationship in 
time is reasonable.  Therefore, t he causal relationship cannot be excluded
xRelated – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or 
adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably explained by a n alternative 
explanation, e.g. concomitant tr eatment of concomitant disease( s).  The relationship 
in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challeng e and re-challenge
13.2.2. Severity Assessment
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adve rse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_19578].  The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of test article, study treatment o r study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and shoul d be evaluated according to t he following scale: 
xMild – Event is noticeable to t he subject, but is easily tolera ted and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities
xModerate – Event is bothersome , possible requiring additional t herapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities
xSevere – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the s ubject’s daily activities
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events
The recording and documenting of adverse events (ocular and non -ocular) begins when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or st udy procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of study treatmen t, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the condition deterior ates at any time during the 
study it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medic al events reported after the 
subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as adverse events  at the discretion of the 
Investigator. 
Upon finding an adverse event, t he Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_19535]. H e/she will complete the Adver se Event /eCRF.   
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available i n the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local  and systemic reactions not meeti ng the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case repor t form or electronic data 
system. All adverse events occurring while the subject is enrol led in the study must be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship.   
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentati on of each reported adverse 
event. All adverse events will be followed in accordance with a pplicable licensing 
requirements.  Such documentati on will include the following: 
CR-6241 v2.0      Page 46 of 109 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom) 
xDrawings or photographs (where appropriate) that detail the fin ding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.)  
xDate the clinical  site was notified 
xDate and time of onset
xDate and time of resolution
xAdverse event classification, s everity, and relationship to tes t articles, as applicable
xTreatment regimen instituted, including concomitant medications  prescribed, in 
accordance with applicable licensing requirements
xAny referral to another health care provider if needed
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any)
xLikely etiology
xBest corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the event and upon conclusion of the 
event
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will comple te the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF.  Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be  collected to determine if the 
infection is microbial in nature.  If cultures are collected, t he date of culture collection and 
laboratory utilized will be recorded. Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow a n assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed.  Adver se events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of  each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the 
assessment of relationship to t he Test Article s hall also be cl early documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event shall be followed by  [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre-tr eatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved.  If further treatment beyond lice nsure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider.  The Inves tigator will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event  will continue in the study.  
If a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be the res ponsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for disconti nuation.  The Investigator will a lso document the adverse event 
appropriately and comp lete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects  with ongoing adverse 
events related to the test article, study treatment or study pr ocedures, as of the final study visit
date, should be followed to resolution of the adverse event or until referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recomme nded by [CONTACT_737]. Non-o cular adverse events that are 
not related to the test article, study treatment, or study proc edures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow-up. 
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by  e-mail, facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery f or any  serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significa nt adverse event.  In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_19579] r to the IEC/IRB according to 
their requirements (Section 13.4.2) .  The report will comment w hether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, stu dy treatment o r study procedures.
CR-6241 v2.0      Page 47 of 109 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor 
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/signifi cant adverse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e-mail, fax, or telephone, but no later than 24 
hours following discovery of the event.  The Investigator is ob ligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor in addition to that inform ation reported on the eCRF. 
All subjects experiencing a serious/significant adverse event m ust be followed up and all 
outcomes must be reported. 
When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the random ization code t o determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subject received.  The S ponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmaski ng the test articles.
In the event of a serious/signifi cant adverse event, the Invest igator must: 
xNotify the Sponsor immediately
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medi cal information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who assisted in the treatment a nd follow-up of the 
subject
xProvide the Sponsor with a comple te case history which includes  a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not  related to the use of the test  article
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedu re according to 
national regulations 
Unanticipated (Serious) A dverse Device Effect (UADE)
In the event of an Unanticipated  (Serious) Adverse Device Effec t (UADE), the Investigator 
will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no 
later than [ADDRESS_392034] rep ort the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB an d participating Investigators w ithin [ADDRESS_392035]. 
Non-Serious Adverse Events
All non-serious adverse events, including non-serious adverse d evice effects, will be reported
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from di scovery. 
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to t he Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting  must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set 
forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB . Each clinical site will refer  to and follow any guidelines 
set forth by [CONTACT_19582].
The Sponsor will report applicable  Adverse Events to the local health authorities according 
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines. 
CR-[ADDRESS_392036]
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting  must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set 
forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB . Each clinical site will refer  to and follow any guidelines 
set forth by [CONTACT_19582].
The Sponsor will report applicable  Adverse Events to the local health authorities according 
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines. 
13.6. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event.  Once discontinued, preg nant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for  study related purposes.  At t he Investigator’s discretion, the 
study participant may be followed by [CONTACT_171191] d elivery. However, this data 
will not be collected as part of the clinical study database.  Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_19583], but due to 
general concerns relating to pregnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584].  S pecifically, pregnant women 
are discontinued due to fluctua tions in refractive error and/or  visual acuity that occur 
secondary to systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforese en health risks to the mother 
or fetus.
14. STATISTICAL METHODS
14.1. General Considerations
Statistical Analysis will be unde rtaken by [CONTACT_318499]. 
A general description of the s tatistical methods to be implemen ted in this clinical trial is 
outlined below.
A stand-alone Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be provided a nd finalized prior to database 
hard-lock, for more details rega rding the statistical analysis methods refer to the SAP. 
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed u sing the Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS) software Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Th roughout the analysis of 
data, the results for each subject/eye will be used when availa ble for summarization and 
statistical analysis.  Unscheduled visits will be summarized se parately and will be excluded
from the statistical analysis.
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables)  will be provided for all 
baseline variables, efficacy variables and safety variables as appropriate.  Continuous 
variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mea n, standard deviation [SD],
median, minimum and maximum). Fre quency count and percentage of  subjects or eyes within 
each category will be provided for categorical data.
CR-[ADDRESS_392037] the primary hypothe sis. Assuming a true 
successful rate of 65% (P T), the sample size was calculated to test whether the true rate  is 
superior to 50% (P 0) with 80% power and 2-sided type I error of 5%. The estimated sample 
size to test the primary hypothesis (H0 P T P0, H1: P T> P 0) is 100. The sample size was 
calculated using PROC POWER for  one sample proportion using an exact Test of a Binomial 
Proportion.
The plan is to enroll approximate ly 135 subjects with a target completion of 100 subjects. Due 
to high drop-out rates observed in a previous neophyte study CR-08 06.13The required sample 
size for enrollment was increas ed by 35% to account for this dr op-out rate. 
14.3. Analysis Populations 
Safety Population: 
All subjects who were administered any test article excluding s ubjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test articl e. At least one observation should  be recorded. 
Per-Protocol Population: 
All subjects who have successfully completed all visits and did  not substantially deviate from 
the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_19588] 
(Per-Protocol Population). Jus tification of excluding subjects w ith protocol deviations in the 
per-protocol population set will  be documented in a memo to fil e. 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population:
All randomized subjects regardless of actual treatment and subs equent withdrawal from study 
or deviation from protocol. A t least one observation should be recorded. 
14.4. Level of Statistical Significance
All planned analysis for this  study will be conducted with an o verall type I error rate of 5%.  
14.5. Primary Analysis  
Proportion of subjects with Successful Fit 
Successful fit is a binary response where X=[ADDRESS_392038] 
lens and X=[ADDRESS_392039] lens will be c ompared to the threshold 0.50. A 
95% confidence interval using the Agresti-Coull method will be u sed. Superiority will be 
concluded in the lower  limit of the 95% confid ence interval is above 0.50. 
14.6. Secondary Analysis  
Not applicable.  
14.7. Other Exploratory Analyses 
All patient re ported outcomes will be desc riptively summarized.  
Further exploratory analysis may be conducted. 
CR-[ADDRESS_392040] clinical trials don’t provide  the evidence that subject dr opout is systematic or not-at-
random. To evaluate the impact of missing data, sensitivity ana lysis will be conducted using 
multiple imputation methods if the proportion of subject dropou t is greater than the 15%. The 
SAS/STAT procedures PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE will be utilized  with a parametric 
regression method used to make at least10 imputations.
14.10. Procedure for Reporting Devia tions from Statistical Plan
The analysis will be conducted according to that specified in a bove sections.  There are no 
known reasons for which it is planned to deviate from these ana lysis methods.  If for any 
reason a change is made, the change will be documented in the s tudy report along with a 
justification for the change.
15. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]/ARCHIVING
15.1. Electronic Case Report Form/Data Collection
The data for this study will be captured on electronic case rep ort forms (eCRFs) using an EDC 
system (Bioclinica). An authorized data originator will enter st udy data into the eCRFs using 
the EDC system. Data collected on equipment that is not capture d in EDC will be formatted 
to the specification of the JJVC  database manager and sent to J JVC for analysis.  
No external data will be c ollected of the study. 
The clinical data will be recorded on dedicated eCRFs specifica lly designed to match the 
study procedures for each visit.   Once completed, the eCRFs wil l be reviewed for accuracy 
and completeness and signed by [CONTACT_737].  The sponsor o r sponsor’s representatives 
will be authorized to gain access to the subject recordation fo r the purposes of monitoring and 
auditing the study.  
Edit checks, electronic queries, and audit trails are built int o the system to ensure accurate and 
complete data collection. Data will be transmitted from the cli nical site to a secure central 
database as forms are complete d or updated, ensuring informatio n accuracy, security, and 
confidentiality. After the final database lock, the Investigato r will be provided with Individual 
Patient Profiles (IPP) including the full audit trail on electr onic media in PDF format for all 
of the study data. The IPP mus t be retained in the study files as a certified copy of the source 
data for the study.

STUDY INFORMATION Location(s) of Research Activity: Loma Linda University Medical Center Expected Start/Stop Dates of Research: 07/01/2021 to 06/30/2023 Special Time Sensitivities:N/A Type of Research: Randomized controlled trial of two alternative standard-of-care transfusion strategies  5. INCLUSION / EXCLUSION CRITERIA Criteria for inclusion of subjects: Adult male patients brought to the emergency department as Level A trauma activations who are receiving emergency blood transfusion Criteria for exclusion of subjects (other than those opposite the inclusion criteria): Female patients (specifically excluded due to risk of alloimmunization of Rh-negative female patients of childbearing age against Rh-positive blood), children, prisoners, patients classified as dead on arrival who will still be randomized but who will have their data excluded to eliminate the effect of survivor bias in the remaining subjects.  6. SUBJECT RECRUITMENT & SCREENING 
 [ADDRESS_1063893] deviation (estimated from the interquartile range) was approximately 4.  Thus with an expectation of alpha = 0.05 and expected power of 90% to detect a similar 2 unit difference in transfusion volume, a sample size of 190 should be sufficient; thus our projected sample size of 200 should be more than adequate.  Age range will be 18 years and older, and only males will be included in the study.  Our expected racial/ethnic distribution will be approximately 60% white, 15% black, 8% Asian, and 18% other race.  No actual recruitment will be performed; rather all qualifying patients will be included.  Consent waiver is being requested.  7. INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS Consent waiver is being requested.   8. STUDY DESIGN a. Background or rationale for this study.   Whole blood transfusion was used in World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam.  By [CONTACT_774655], whole blood had been separated into components for ease of use and more focused transfusion.  As a result, transfusion practices did not catch up with the available units.  More recent investigations have revealed that patients have fewer deaths from hemorrhage when the ratios of FFP:RBC units and platelet:RBC units approaches 1:1. Furthermore, the success of “walking blood banks” with fresh whole blood transfusion in the 2nd Iraq war and the war in Afghanistan have prompted new interest in the civilian use of whole blood.  While civilian centers cannot use walking blood banks as we do not have  a pre-screened population from which to draw, low-titer type O positive whole blood (LTOWB) can be used.  One LTOWB unit is equivalent to one unit of PRBC and one unit of FFP.  While LTOWB has been studied, the inclusion criteria for past studies has been less inclusive than in this trial, specifically excluding patients with severe traumatic brain injuries even if they also had exsanguinating hemorrhage.  Furthermore, at Loma Linda University Medical Center we will have the opportunity to randomize patients to receive whole blood as their first transfusion, thus maximizing the potential benefits.  Finally, we have the opportunity to study the coagulopathy associated with these patients by [CONTACT_774656].   b. Objectives 1. Evaluate PRBC equivalents transfused in each group in the first 24 hours (Primary outcome) 2.

If any deception is required for validity of this study, explain why this is necessary and how subject(s) will be debriefed. N/A f. Concise review of literature that supports the rationale, objectives, and methodology of the proposed study.  Whole blood transfusion has been used in multiple military conflicts for more than one hundred years. (1)  As mentioned above, during the 1960’s and 1970’s advancements in blood banking allowed for the transfusion of isolated components, although this was done without detailed investigation.  The institution first of fresh whole blood, followed by [CONTACT_119403]-stored whole blood, was made necessary during the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Cold-stored whole blood has since been adapted for the civilian setting, with one unit considered equivalent to 1 unit of PRBC and 1 unit of FFP.   Low-titer O negative whole blood has been safely administered through a trial performed at UT Houston, with no transfusion reactions in the whole blood group. (1)The group at Barnes-Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_195577]. Louis, MO, performed a prospective observational trial over an eighteen-month comparing outcomes before and after whole blood was introduced into their system.  In this study of 86 patients, there was no unadjusted difference in survival, although there was an improved odds of survival in the whole blood group after adjusting for maximum clot firmness as measured by [CONTACT_774659]. (2) A retrospective cohort study of 270 matched patients indicated no difference in clinical outcomes. (3)A large retrospective analysis of the data from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program indicated that 280 patients receiving whole blood had reduced 24-hour and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], reduced rate of complications after adjustment for clinical covariates. (4)  However, none of these studies are randomized, most use O-negative whole blood or a mixture of O-positive and O-negative whole blood, and there is no discussion of alloimmunization of female recipi[INVESTIGATOR_774652].   There is only one previously published randomized clinical trial of leukoreduced type specific whole blood for type O and type A recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  In this trial of [ADDRESS_1063897] met criteria for inclusion, only 107 were actually randomized, introducing selection bias.  In particular, the exclusion for the patients felt to be “too sick to wait” for blood typi[INVESTIGATOR_774653].  However, this study did demonstrate a reduction in transfusion volumes for patients after those with brain injury were excluded. (5) As can be seen, the current field of literature leaves multiple unanswered questions that will be answered by [CONTACT_272778]. 1) Does transfusion with low-titer O-positive whole blood reduce the amount of transfusion within 24 hours of arrival? 2) Does transfusion with low-titer O-positive whole blood reduce 6 hour, 24 hour, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]? 3) What is the effect of low-titer O-positive whole blood transfusion on coagulopathy after trauma, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_774659]? 4) Is the potential benefit of transfusion with low-titer O-positive whole blood restricted only to patients receiving massive transfusion (6 units PRBC or more) or in all patients receiving emergency transfusion? g.

LABELING & STORAGE OF DATA & SPECIMENS No data to be stored in hard copy form.  Data will be entered into secure REDCAP database, with a master list correlating study ID number, MRN, and treatment arm to be kept on LLUMC secure server.   11. DATA ANALYSIS Analysis to be performed by [CONTACT_133763]/IQR with nonparametric comparison of medians for central tendency.  P value of 0.[ADDRESS_1063898] 4 hours (massive transfusion).  Also, an intentional sub-analysis will be performed on the patients who were classified as dead on arrival.  Separate sub-analyses will be performed on patients with Abbreviated Injury Score (Head) of [ADDRESS_1063899]-of-care transfusion strategies.  As such, it has been verified by [CONTACT_774660].  Female patients are excluded at this time to ensure that there is no possibility of inadvertent alloimmunization of Rh-negative childbearing women with Rh-positive blood products.  As both the component therapy (O+ or O-) and the O+ whole blood that is administered at LLUMC would be uncrossmatched, there is a risk of transfusion reaction but this risk is not different between groups.    13. BENEFIT(S) It is possible that patients transfused with LTO+WB may experience improved resolution of coagulopathy.  As such it is possible that they may experience either reduced transfusion or even a survival benefit. Thus far, available literature has not demonstrated a survival benefit consistently, nor has it consistently demonstrated reduced need for transfusion.  As such, it is felt by [CONTACT_774661].  14. COMPENSATION N/A  15. CONFIDENTIALITY At the time of data entry into the database, MRN and date of birth will be redacted.  A single master list will exist on a LLUMC secure server with the assignment list until the data collection is complete.  The RedCap database is endorsed by [CONTACT_774662], and in addition will not contain PHI.  16.  LITERATURE REVIEW   1. Williams J, Merutka N, Meyer D, Bai Y, Prater S, Cabrera R, et al.

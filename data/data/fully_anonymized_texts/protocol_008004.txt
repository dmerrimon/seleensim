5.Introduction
5.1. Rationale and Justification for the Study
Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) is a receptor ty rosine kinase (RTK) involved in crit ical 
cellular act ivities such as angiogenesis, proliferat ion, survival, wound repair, and migration. 
Receptor dimerizat ion initiates the ty rosine kinase cascade of diverse downstream signaling, 
such as SOS -GRB2 -RAS -RAF -MAPK, GAB -1-PI3K -AKT , PLC-PIP3/DAG -PKC -RAF -
MAPK ,p38MAPK ,JNK,STAT, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 2 (as reviewed by [CONTACT_764485] 2010).  Activat ion of FGFR plays a pi[INVESTIGATOR_764465].
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ( FGFR3 ), 1of [ADDRESS_1047378] ive in bladder, m ultiple myel oma, non-small cell l ung cancer ( NSCLC ), 
glioblastoma mult iforme(GBM) , and cervical cancer through overexpressio n, point mutations, 
and translocat ions(Singh et al. 2012; Parker et al. 2013; Williams et al. 2013; Wuet al. 2013).  
Aberrant activat ion of FGFR3 through overexpressio n has been shown to be sufficient to induce 
oncogenic transformat ion in fibroblasts, hematopoietic cells, and murine bone marrow 
transp lantation m odels (Plowright et al . 2000; Chesi et al. 200 1; Ronchetti et al. 2001; Chen et al. 
2005).
LY3076226 is an ant i
-FGFR3 ant ibody  conj ugated to a cy totoxic payload, DM4, a may tansine 
derivat ive that inhibit s tubulin dynamics. The ant i-FGFR3 ant ibody recognizes not only wild-
type (WT) receptor, but also constitutively act ivemutant receptors (S249C, Y373C ,and others) 
and transforming acidic coil ed-coil (TACC3) fusio n proteins of FGFR3 (Stewart et al. 2004;
Kiemene yet al. 2010 ).  This allows LY3076226 to selectively internalize the FGFR3 receptor 
and deliver the cytotoxi ninto the target cancer cells that are aberrant lyactivated by  [CONTACT_412300]3 
receptor ,regardless o f mechanism.  DM4 is catabolized once the receptor —antibody- drug 
conjugate ( ADC )complexis internalized, providing specific killing of the unwanted cancer cell 
along wi th by[CONTACT_764486].
Maytansine was developed in [ADDRESS_1047379], melano ma, lung, co lorectal , and ovari an 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Blum et al . 1978 a; Blum  et al . 1978b; Cabanillas et al. 1978; 
Chabner et al. 1978; Cabanillas et al. 1979; Neidhart et al . 1980; Ravry  et al . 1985) .  The adverse 
event (AE) profile was similar to other anti
-tubulin agents ,with gastrointestinal (GI) and central  
nervous system ( CNS )toxicities being dose limiting.  The doses selected to avoid and mit igate 
higher -grade toxi city did not dem onstrate sufficient activit yand devel opment was stopped. 
Selectively targeting aberrant cells using an ant ibody  thatrecognize scancer -specific cell surface 
receptors to deliver a maytansine derivat ive directly into the cell  has the potential to decrease the 
systemic exposure ,thereby [CONTACT_764487] -limit ing GI and CNS effects while 
potenti ally increasing the efficacy .  Another derivative of may tansine, DM1, has been

LY3076226successfully conjugated to an ant i-human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 ( HER2) antibody 
for use in the treatm ent of HER2+ metastati c breast cancer (Kadcyla package insert, 2014) .A 
number of other may tansine ant ibody -drug conj
ugates wi th either DM1 or DM4 payloads are 
currently in clinical trials (Trail 2013) .
Urothelial carcino ma, a cancer invo lving the transitional epi[INVESTIGATOR_764466],
is a ty pe of  cancer that ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_764467] (90% of cases), renal pelvis (8%),
or ureters or urethra (remaining 2%, combined). For simp licity, the di sease is often referred to as
bladder cancer. Transit ional cell carcino ma (TCC) is the predominant histologic t ype of
urothelial carcino ma in North America and Europe, where it accounts for ≥ 90% of all bladder 
cancers (Billis et al . 2001; Ch alasani et al . 2009). Other histol ogic subt ypes are squamous cell,
adenocarcino ma, and small -cell tum ors. Urothelial tumors with a mixture of histologic subt ypes
and transit ional cell predominance are generally treated similarly as urothelial (transit ional cell)
carcino mas (NCCN 2014).
Almost half o f patients with urothelial carcino ma have FGFR3 genet ic mutations. In 2015 in the 
[LOCATION_002], there will be an estimated 74,000 newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer with 
16,000 deaths (American Cancer So ciety 2015) .  Point m utations (S249C in the extracellu lar 
domain, R248C in the transmembrane domain, and Y373C and Y375C in the kinase domain )
occur i n 70% to 80% of patients wi th early  stage TCC .  Despi [INVESTIGATOR_764468] -Guérin (BCG) /radiation/surgery , the recurrence rate i s 50% to 70%, with 10% to 20% 
of patients progressing to muscle-invasive disease (Al -Ahmadie et al . 2011). In muscle -invasive 
disease, act ivating mutations of FGFR3 are reported in 11% to 20% of patients (TCG A 2014 ) 
and FGFR3 overexpressio n is seen in 35 % to 50% of patients. Taken together, these data make 
FGFR3 a particularly  relevant target for the treatment of urothelial carcino ma(Guancial et al . 
2014; Sung et al. 2014 ; Turo et al. 2015 ).
LY3076226 may overco me the dose -limit ing toxicit ies (DLTs) of tradi tional cytotoxi c therapy  
by [CONTACT_764488] ,resul ting in 
greater tumor reduction/efficacy . This init ial Phase 1 study  with LY3076226, Study  I70-MC-
JOBA (JOBA), will characterize the safet y and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) of LY3076226 in patients with advance dor metastati c cancer.
The sponsor, monitor, and invest igators will perform this study in complianc e with the protocol , 
good clinical pract ice (GCP) and Internat ional Conference on Harmonisat ion (ICH) guidelines, 
and applicable regulatory  requi rements.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047380] ive of this study  is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule of 
LY3076226 that may safely  be administered to patients with advanced or m etastati c cancer .

5.3.1. Mechanism of Action and In Vitro/In Vivo Activity
LY3076 226 i s an ant ibody -drug conjugate (ADC) composed of IMC -D11, an immunoglobulin 
G, subclass 1 ( IgG1 )monoclonal ant ibody  against FGFR3, attached with a cleavable linker, 
sulfo -SPDB (disulfide N -succinimidyl 4 -
[2-pyridyldi thio]butyrate), to the maytansine derivative 
DM4, a tubulin inhibitor.   LY3076226 uses a selective, high -affini ty, neutralizing, phage -
derived, fully human IgG1 monoclonal ant ibody  against the human FGFR3b/c protein. This IgG 
1λmonocl onal  antibody  to FGFR3 , IMC -D11,was generated for use in human cancer patients 
with FGFR3 amplifications, overexpressio n, and activat ing mutations. The antibody co mponent 
of LY3076226, IMC -D11,blocks ligand -dependent as well as ligand -independent signaling in 
tumor-derived cell lines and in FGFR3 stably transfected cells.  The ant i-FGFR3 IMC -D11 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_764469]3 ligand binding. IMC -D11 was 
selected for its abilit y to potently  block primary  FGFR3 ligand -dependent (ligand s fibroblast 
growth factor [FGF] -1 and FGF -9 and all others) cancer cell pro liferat ion and induce FGFR3 
receptor internalizat ion and degradation with similar potency , which resul ts in FGFR3 -mediated 
cancer cell death . Importantly, IMC -D11 is fully cross -reactive wit h human, cyno molgus
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 18
LY3076226monkey, rat ,and mouse FGFR3b/3c receptors binding with similar affinit ies. IMC -D11 has 
comparable act ivity against wild ty pe andmutant FGFR3 and has demonstrable tumor growth 
inhibit ion invivo inseveral bladder cancer cell lines and mult iple myelo ma models, wi th marked 
decreases in receptor phosphorylat ion,as well as a significant decrease in phosphorylation o f 
mitogen -activated protein kinase ( MAPK ).
IMC -D11 is conjugated to the maytansine derivat ive DM 4 (a tubulin inhibitor) via a cleavable 
linker m oiety (sulfo -SPDB).  LY3076226 binds specifically  to the hum an FGFR3 protein with 
high affinit y, and f ollowing internalizat ion can deliver potent cy totoxi c paylo ad resul ting in cell 
cycle arrest and cell death (Discovery , Eli Lilly  and Com pany , preclinical invitrostudy IMC37 ; 
LY3076226 Invest igator’s Brochure, Eli Lilly and Company, 2015) .  Sulfo -SPDB, the linker 
porti on of  LY3076226, was selected to balance the toxicit y of the drug mo iety by [CONTACT_764490] m etabo lism of the drug mo iety(Discovery , Eli Lilly  and Com pany, preclinical 
invitro study  IMC37; Discovery , Eli Lilly and Company, preclinical study  5404 -12).  Sulfo -
SPDB conj ugates, when metabo lized intracellularly, generate 3 metabo lic pr oducts (lysine -
N[epsilo n]-SPDB -DM4, DM4, and S -methyl-DM4), 2 of which are capable of promoting 
by[CONTACT_764491] (DM4 and S -methyl-
DM4 [DM4 -Me]), whi ch can also increase toxicit y through non -specific killing of proliferat ing, 
norm al cells.  Sulfo- SPDB was selected over other cleavable linkers due to its high processing 
efficiency (Zhao et al . 2011) , superior efficacy in some tumor models, as well as 
toxicity/tolerabilit y considerat ions(Discovery ,Eli Lilly and Co mpany, preclinical study  5404-
12).  However, due to this by[CONTACT_764492], sulfo -SPDB conj ugates can also 
increase toxicit y through non -specific killing of normal cells (Erickson et al .
2012).
LY3076226 was studied in 3bladder patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with unknown 
FGFR3 expressio n (receptor densit y not determined), 21NSCLC models of varying ant igen 
densit y (determined by  [CONTACT_87337]3 m essenger ribonucleic acid [m RNA ]),and 7 in-house cell -line-
derived bladder xenograft models representative of FGFR3; wild ty pe, S249C m utant ,and 
TACC3 fusion-positive as defined by  [CONTACT_764493], mRNA expressio n, 
immunohistochemistry  (IHC),and ModaPlex analysis.  Preclinical in vivo efficacy data 
demonstrate that treatment with LY3076226 inhibits tum or growth in a number of cell-line-
derived human bladder and mult iple myelo ma xenograft s,as well as a sq uamous NSCLC PDX
model (LXFE 2227) that is TACC3 fusion-positive as defined by [CONTACT_764494] . The 
invivo responses observed (including com plete response [CR], partial response [PR], and stable 
disease [SD]) are durable and LY3076226 was demo nstrated to mechanist ically induce tumor 
cell apoptosis.   Importantly, LY3076226 had no activit y in xenograft models devoid o f FGFR3 
cell surface expressio n, which further supports the FGFR3 specificit y of the m olecule.
Significant cy totoxi c act ivity of LY3076226 was observed when the mo lecule was used to treat
each of the FGFR3- overexpressing bladder tumor cell lines. The compound was slight ly more 
potent in the UMUC -14 tum or cell  line, which overexpresses FGFR3 containing a mutation 
(S249C) in the extracellular domain that renders the receptor constitutively active. The negat ive 
control  isotype-matched ADC showed no cy totoxici ty in the concentration ranges seen with 
LY3076226 in any  of the lines. A bladder tumor cell line ,KU-19-19, thatdoes not overexpress

5.3.2. Nonclin ical Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacokinet icsand/or toxi cokinet ics(TK) of LY3076226 have been studied in mice, rats, and 
cyno molgus monkeys fo llowing single intravenous ( IV)administration of 3, 10 ,or 20 m g/kg or 
once -weekly repeat -dose admini strati on of  1, 3, and 10or 15 mg/kg.  Plasma PKof LY3076226, 
either conj ugated LY3076226 (LY3076226 with at least one DM4 payload) or total LY3076226 
IgG, were characterized using enzyme- linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays.  Plasma 
concentrations of free DM (total  free immunoreactive may tansine species) were quant ified by 
[CONTACT_764495].  In l ater studi es, DM4 and DM4 -Me were 
quant ified with liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry  (LC-MS)assays.
Following IV administration PKand TKstudi es, plasma concentration -versus -time profiles for 
conjugated LY3076226 and total LY3076226 IgG demonstrated similar maximum plasma 
concentration ( Cmax) values and eliminat ion profiles.  Plasma concentrations for both conju gated 
and total  LY3076226 increased with increasing dose.  In both the rat and monkey ,there was 
limited evidence of super -proporti onalit y observed in C maxand area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve ( AUC )in so me studies, but this was 2 -fold or les s across doses of 1 
through 20 m g/kg. There were no apparent sex differences in the PK/TKof LY3076226.  The 
mean eliminati on half-life (t1/2) for conj ugated LY3076226 was approximately 20hours in the 
mouse, 16 to 42 hours after a single dose in the rat, and 45 to 101 hours after single or mult iple 
doses in the monkey .  The m ean t1/2for total  LY3076226 IgG was approximately  23 hours in the 
mouse, 9 to 31 hours fo llowing single -dose adminis tration in the rat, and 45 to 138 hours after 
single or mult iple doses in the monkey.  In the rat, concentrations of conjugated and total 
LY3076226 IgG were variable (reduced or no longer quantifiable) in so me animals after repeat 
administration, and no ac cumulation was apparent.  These observat ions in the rat were possibly 
affected by  [CONTACT_14181]-drug ant ibodies ( ADA ).  In the monkey, once -weekly  dosing at 1 or 3 m g/kg 
demonstrated li ttle or no accum ulation (2-fold or less) .
Based on the valida ted LC -MS assay for DM4 and DM4- Me, plasma concentrations of these 
species in both rat and cyno molgus monkey increased with increasing dose and did not 
accumulate with repeated dosing.  There w ereinsufficient data for t1/2estimat ions for DM4 or 
DM4 -Me in the monkey.  In th e rat, mean DM4 and DM4 -Me t1/2estimates were 16 to 19 and 22 
to 29 hours, respectively.  DM4 and DM4 -Me were a sm all fraction (generally  less than 2.5% in 
the rat and 0.07% in the monkey on a mo lar basis) of conjugated LY3076226.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047382] and cy totoxi city (Erickson et al . 2010 ).  Both DM4 and DM4 -Me have been ident ified in 
the ADC literature as active metabolites released both in vitro and in vivo (Erickson et al .2006; 
Erickson et al .2010).  Mouse studies suggest that active maytansine species are further 
detoxified by [CONTACT_764496] (Sun et al . 2011).
Invitro drug-drug interaction ( DDI)studi es have not been conducted with LY3076226.  The 
invitro DDI potenti al of DM4 has been evaluated (Davis et al. 2012).  While the free sulfhydryl 
in DM4 has the potential to inact ivate CYP3A4 in an NADPH -dependent manner, the low 
plasma concentrations observed clinically for free DM4 arising from ADCs suggest that this is of 
limited clinical concern.
5.3.3. Nonclinical Toxicology
To support clinical investigation o f LY3076226, a package o f nonclinical toxico logy studi es 
have been conducted with LY3076226.  These studies are supplemented with data from prior
nonclinical safet y studi es thatinvest igated both the monoclonal antibody  and drug conjugate 
parts of LY3076226 .
The repeat -dose toxic ology studi es of LY3076226 consisted of 5-week studies in rats at dosages 
of 1, 3,or 10 m g/kg (equivalent to 6, 18 ,or 60 mg/m2, respectively) or in cyno molgus m onkeys
at dosages of 1, 3
,or 15 m g/kg (equivalent to 12, 36, or 180 m g/m2, respectively) .  LY3076226 
was given by  [CONTACT_764497] (slow bolus) once weekly for 5occasi ons (Days 1, 8, 15, 22 ,and 29).  
The dosing schedule used in the toxico logy studi es represents a m ore intense schedule than is 
planned in this Phase [ADDRESS_1047383],
liver,andreproductive system sconsistent wi th the cy totoxic effects of the DM4 payload.   
Toxicit ies at the lower doses (1 or 3 mg/kg) were of lower severit y and frequency  than those 
observed at the high dose in either species.
Adverse skin react ions with subsequent generalized debilitat ion resulted in the premature 
euthanasia of rats and monkeys at the highest dose of LY3076226 tested in each species (10 or 
15 m g/kg, respect ively).   Although adverse skin reactions were seen at lower dosages (1 or 
3mg/kg) in both rat and monkey, these did not cause debilitat ion and premature euthanasia .
Dry, flaking, reddened, disco loredand/or sloughing skin was seen in both rats (3 or 10 mg/kg) 
and mo nkeys (all dosages).  Skin changes were seen on the limbs (including inject ion sites) , 
dorsal  andventral  surfaces, face, ey elids and/or eyebrows.  In the monkey , microscopic changes 
in the skin comprised hyperkeratosis, dyskeratosis, necrosis, inflammat ion,and pi[INVESTIGATOR_764470]; in the rat, hyperplasia, ulcerat ion,and inflammat ion were se en in the skin.  In both 
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 21
LY3076226species, increased mitoses and single -cell necrosi s were seen in the skin (and in many  other 
tissues).  After an 8-week reversibilit y peri od, skin lesi ons were st ill present in both rat and 
monkey, but the incidence and/or severit ywas reduced.
In the 5 -week monkey study , haze at the corneal limbus was seen by [CONTACT_41157] -lamp examinat ion after 
5 treatments in all animals treated at 3 mg/kg and was acco mpanied by [CONTACT_764498][INVESTIGATOR_764471] y of the affected animals.  Microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y, increased mitoses and single -cell necrosi s 
were present in the corneal epit helium
at all dosages ; dyskeratosi swas seen in animals treated at 
3 mg/kg or m ore.  After the 8-week recovery  period, the corneal hazing was not present, 
although pi [INVESTIGATOR_764472] –dyskeratosis and/or pi[INVESTIGATOR_764473] .  
Corneal pi[INVESTIGATOR_764474] a likely sequelae of the 
corneal  injury noted in terminal and early death animals.  In the rat, although no corneal lesio ns 
were seen by [CONTACT_764499], increased mito ses in the corneal epit helium were seen at 
all dosages after 5 weeks of treatment; this change was not apparent after the [ADDRESS_1047384] dose ; these changes were completely reversible after 
8week s ofrecovery .
Effects on the bone marrow and lympho id tissues, with conco mitant effects on circulat ing red
and white blood cells ,were consistent with the cy totoxi c act ivity of the DM4 payload.  These 
changes were most severe at the high dose in ratsand monkeys and comprised decreased 
erythroid and early myelo
id progenitors and increased mitoses/single -cell n ecrosi sin the bone 
marrow, increased mitoses and/or decreased cellularit y of lympho id tissue, decreased ery throid 
mass and decreased reticulocy te, neutrophil, lymphocy te, m onocy te,and eosinophil counts ; at 
the lower dosages, these effects were less sever e and/or frequent in both species.  Effects on bone 
marrow, blood ,and lympho id tissue showed complete or almost complete recovery during the 
8-week reversibilit y peri od.
In male rats, tubul ar degeneration in the testis and hypospermia/inflammation in the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_764475] (10 mg/kg) and in 1 or 2 males at the 3 -mg/kg dose; 
no similar changes were seen at 1 mg/kg.  The effects on testes and epi [INVESTIGATOR_764476].
Increased mitoses and/or single -cell necrosi s was seen in a number of other tissues ,including the 
liver, gallbladder, pancreas, salivary  glands ,kidney s, epi[INVESTIGATOR_764477], prostate, seminal vesicles, 
ovari es, cervix, uterus, mammary gland
,and/or vagina in monkeys or rats.  These changes were 
generally confined to the highest dose in either species and only rarely  were these effects seen at 
the 3-mg/kg dose level.  The changes in the liver of rats were accompanied by  [CONTACT_764500].
Increased heart rate and decreased RR, PR, a nd QT intervals were seen in mo nkeys fo llowing 
treatm ent at 3 or 15 mg/kg; no decrease in corrected QT ( QTc)interval was apparent and there 
were no unusual or abnormal rhythms or waveforms.  Heart rates in monkeys treated at 3 or 
15mg/kg were approximate ly 25% or 60% higher than eit her prestudy  values or time -matched 
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047385] son heart rate w ereseen at 1 mg/kg .  LY3076226 had no effect on 
body  temperature, breathing rate ,or neurol ogical param eters.
Based on the nonclinical toxico logy studi es of  LY3076226, the DLTs are expected to be skin 
lesions, corneal  changes, myelo suppression, and/or GItoxicity.  These changes are considered 
manageable, and at least partial reversibili ty has been dem onstrated .  Appropriate endpo ints to 
monitor pati ent safet y have been incorporated into this clinical protocol.
For Study  JOBA, an init ial clinical starting dose of 6 mg/m2(equivalent to 0.18 mg/kg for a 
patient wi th a body  surface area of 1.8 m2and body weight of 6 0 kg) administered once every 
21days was selected based on the highest non -severely toxicdose (HNSTD) in the most 
sensit ive animal species and on PK project ions that suggest the exposure at this dose is
comparable wi th the minimally efficacious exposure ,whileensuring an adequate safet y margin.  
The starting dose is onesixth ofthe HNSTD in the most sensit ive species ( based on a dose of 
3mg/kg or 36 mg/m2in cyno molgus monkeys) .  Table JOBA. 1shows the calculated exposure 
multiples for the clinical starting dose and highest pl anned dose rel ative to the exposure at the 
HNSTD in monkeys.

LY30762265.4. Rationale for Selection of Dose
A dose range of 0.2 (rounded up from 0.18 for ease of calcu lation) to 5 m g/kg of LY3076226 
administered IVon D ay 1 of a 21 -day cycle was selected based on nonclinical toxico logy, 
efficacy ,andPK data.
The starting dose for Study  JOBA is a dose of 0.2 mg/kg (6 mg/m2) administered on Day 1 of a 
21-day cycle. As indicated in  Table JOBA. 1, when calculated on the basis o f mg/m2dosing, this 
dose i s approximately  3-fold lower than the minimally  toxic dose (MinTD) of 3 mg/ kg 
(18mg/m2) in rats and 6 -fold lower than the HNSTD of 3 mg/kg (36 mg/m2) in cyno molgus 
monkeys.
Table JOBA. 2gives the m ean predicted maximum (observed) plasma concentration at steady  
state (
Cmax,ss)and AUC (0-21d,ss)for the various ant icipated dose levels to be tested in Study  JOBA.  
Exposure levels (C maxand AUC (0-7 d)) after m ultiple doses at the MinTD in rats and the HNSTD 
in cyno molgus m onkeys are summarized in Sect ion 5.3.3 (Nonclinical Toxico logy).  Based on a 
human starting dose of 0.2 mg/kg given once every 21 days and t he exposure observed after 
multiple doses at the MinTD of 3 mg/kg (18 mg/m2) in rats, the mean predicted exposure 
multiples are approximately 6.8 for AUC (0-21d,ss)and 13.6 for Cmax,ss.  When calculated using 
exposures observed at the HNSTD of 3 mg/kg (36 mg/m2) in cyno molgus mo nkey s, the m ean 
predi cted exposure mult iples are approximately 15.5 for AUC (0-21d,ss)and 13.[ADDRESS_1047386] dose associated with co mplete tumor regression in 4 out of 
5mice per dose group was 10 mg/kg administered either as a single IV administration ( qd×1 ) or 
as two 5 -mg/kg IV administrations separated by a 14 -day dosing interval ( q14d×2).  A PK m odel 
developed for LY3076226 in mice indicates a mean AUC (0-28d)and C maxin plasma of 
approximately  3600 µg∙h/mL and 123 µg/mL, respectively, for the 10- mg/kg qd×1 dose group.  
AUC (0-28d)and Cmaxwere estimated at 3030 µ
g∙h/mL and 61.2 µg/mL, respectively, after 
5mg/kg administered q14d×2.
The minimally  efficaci ous dose (MED) in human swas subsequently projected using a human 
PK m odel obtained by [CONTACT_764502].  This 
projected human PK model indicates that a dose of 1.6 to 1.8 mg/kg would be needed to achieve 
an AUC (0-21d,ss)in pat ients similar to the AUC (0-28d)observed in mouse.  Likewise, human C max
values similar to those obtained in mice woul d be obtained at a dose ranging from 3.0 to 
7.2mg/kg.
Altogether, these results suggest a MED in human s ranging from 1.6 to 3.0 mg/kg.  Based on the 
LY3076226 plasma exposures observed at the MinTD in rats, the mean AUC exposure mult iples 
predi cted at steady  state for thi s MED proj ection range fro m 0.5 to 0.2.  When using LY3076226 
plasma exposures observed at the MinTD in rats, the mean projected AUC exposure mult iples at 
steady  state range fro m 1.1 to 0.4.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 25
LY3076226Based on data from the rat and nonhuman primate toxico logy studi es, the DLTs in humans are 
expected to be monitorable and reversible. The proposed dose -escalation strategy  will thus be 
guided by  [CONTACT_764503] a human PK/PD model, which will be updated as 
human clinical PK data are available. The primary determinant, however, will be safet y. The 
actual dose increment between cohorts and the example dose level o f each cohort will be 
determined according to the constraints described in Section 7.2.2 (Dose Escalat ion).

LY30762266.2.1. Study Completion and End of Trial
This study  will be cons idered complete (that is, the scient ific evaluation will be co mplete [study  
completion])following the protocol -specified final analysis for the primary  and secondary  
objectives.
The end o f trial occurs after study  com pletion and after the last patient has discont inued study  
treatm ent and com pleted any  applicable continued access follow -up.
6.2.2. Continued Access Period
All patients remaining on study  treatm ent without disease progression fo llowing the final 
analysis for the primary and secondary  objectives will be a ble to enter the continued access 
period of  the study .  The continued access period begins after study  com pletion and ends at the 
end of trial.  During the continued access period, pati ents on study  treatm ent who continue to 
experience clinical b enefit may  continue to receive study  treatm ent until disease progression, 
death, unacceptable toxicit y, or start of new ant icancer treatment.  Thecontinued access period 
includes a fo llow-up visi t.  The foll ow-up visit begins [ADDRESS_1047395] of the patient to start a new 
anticancer treatment prior to the scheduled e nd of the fo llow-up visi t, the f ollow-up visit duration 
may be shortened. In this case, the fo llow-up assessments should be completed prior to the 
initiation of the new therapy.
During the continued access period, a ll AEs, SAEs, study drug dosing, and dos e reducti on of  
treatm ent will be collected on the case report form ( CRF).
Serious adverse events will also be reported to Lilly Global Pat ient Safet yand collected in the 
pharmacovigilance system (Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS] ).  In the event that an SAE occurs, addit ional 
inform ation (such as local laboratory  resul ts, concomi tant m edicati ons, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509]) may 
be requested by  [CONTACT_574435].
Invest igators may perform other standard procedures and tests needed to treat and evaluate 
patients; however, Lilly will not routinely  collect the results of these assessments.
6.3. Discontinuations
If a patient withdraws informed consent, he or she must not be contact[CONTACT_133392] n and consent.  Lilly may cont inue to use previously co llected 
medical research data prior to the withdrawal consistent with the original authorizat ion.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047396] occur between 
the sponsor clinical research physician (CRP) and the invest igator to determine whether the 
patient may  cont inue in the s tudy, with or wi thout investi gational product.  Inadvertent ly 
enrolled patients may be maintained in the study and on investigat ional product when the Lilly  
CRP agrees with the investigator that it is medically appropriate for that patient. The patient 
may not continue in the study  with or wi thout investi gational product if the Lilly  CRP does not 
agree wi th the invest igator’s determinat ion that i t is m edically appropriate for the patient to 
continue. The invest igator must obtain documented approval fro m the Lilly CRP to allow the 
inadvertent ly enro lled pat ient to conti nue in the study  with or wi thout invest igational product.
In addit ion, pati ents will  be discont inued fro m the study  drug and/or from the study  in the 
following circumstances:

LY30762267.2.2. Dose Escalation
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose -Limiting Toxicity Determination and Maximum Tolerated Dose 
Definition
Dose -limit ing toxicit y (DLT) is defined as an AE occurring during Cycle 1thatis at least 
possibly  related to LY3076226 and fulfills any one of the following criteri ausing the NCI -
CTCAE v 4.0:
CTCAE Grade ≥3 non -hematol ogical  toxicity.  Excepti ons will  be m ade for the 
following :
oNausea, vo miting, diarrhea, and constipation that can be controlled with treatment
(Grade 3 and Grade 4 nausea, vomit ing, or diarrhea should be considered DLTs if 
persisting for more than 48 hours ,despi[INVESTIGATOR_764479].)
oAnorexia
oGrade 3 fat igue lasting ≤5 days
Grade 3 elevations of ALT and/or AST last ing >7days.
Concurrent elevat ion of ALT >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN in the absence o f 
biliary  obstructi on or other causes that could reasonably explain the elevat ion.
CTCAE Grade 4 neutropenia of>7 days’durati on
Any febrile neutropenia
CTCAE Grade 3 thrombocy topeni a with bleeding
CTCAE Grade 4 thrombocy topeni a with or wi thout bl eeding
Any other significant toxicity deemed by  [CONTACT_764508] (for example, any toxicit y that is at least possibly 
related to the study  medicati on and that requi res the wi thdrawal  of the pati ent from the 
study  during Cycle 1 or del ays the start of Cycle 2 by  >14 days ).
For the purpose of this study , the MTD i s defined as the highest dose tested that has less than 
33% probabilit y of causing a DLT .
[IP_ADDRESS]. DLT-Equivalent Toxicity
A DLT -equivalent toxicit y is defined as an AE occurring during Cycle [ADDRESS_1047401] met the criteria for a DLT if i t had occurred during Cycle 1. For individual pat ients 
experiencing a DLT -equivalent toxicit y, dose adj ustm ents will be m ade as outlined in Section 
7.2.6 .At each interim analysis (as defined in Sect ion 10.10 ), the rate of DLT -equivalent 
toxicities will be assessed. If the rate of DLT -equivalent toxicit ies is unacceptable ( for example , 
a DLT -equivalent toxicity is observed in >33% patients at a given dose level), the data will be 
reviewed by  [CONTACT_764509]/ clinical research scient ist (CRS )and a safet y 
analysis may betriggered .If the findings indicate that a dose level does not have an acceptable 
safet y profile for chronic (Cycle 2 or later) administration, then a lower dose level will be chosen 
for further invest igation. This decisio n will be documented in writing.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 36
LY30762267.2.2.3. Dose -Escalation Method
For Part A , the proposed starti ngdose l evel will be 0.2mg/kg.  Dose escalat ion will proceed at a 
maximum dose increment of 100%.  A n accelerated dose -escalat ion scheme will be used, as 
follows:  initial cohorts will enro ll at least onepatient each until adose l evel of 1.6 m g/kg is 
reached, unless a ≥Grade 2 toxicitythat is at l eastpossibly  related to LY3076226 is observed
requi ringadditional patients to be enrolled to a dose le vel. After which amodified 3+3 scheme,
with incorporati on of  a Bayesian model -based ,toxicit y-band method ( Neuenschwander et al. 
2008), will be followed, wherein at least 3patients will be enrolled in each of the subsequent 
cohorts . The Bayesian model-based ,toxicity-band method incorporates the prior expectations of 
the dose -toxicity curve andthe observed DLT data after each cohort andprovide squant itative 
guidance on the determinat ion of the dose l evel for the next cohort , with control  of over dosing 
probabilit y. This method will be applied to the observed data on an ongoing basis throughout the 
dose escalat ion. The toxicit y-band method will stop if the prespecified maximum number of 
patients i s reached or the recommended next dose level has been administered to at least [ADDRESS_1047402] igators and Lilly CRP/CRS will consi der both the 
model recommendati on and the observed DLT rate at each cohort to determine the next dose 
level and determine when to stop dose escalat ion.Safety data, in particular ,AEs, will be the 
primary  criteriafor dose escal ation. In addit ion, if available at the time of the dose-escalation 
decisio n, PK (Cmax, AUC, and systemic clearance [ CL]) resul ts will be used as 
secondary /supporti ng data for dose escalation. Additional patients may,therefore ,be enrolled at 
a specific dose level to characterize PK/PD. No dose escalat ion can occur without prior 
discussio n and agreement between the invest igator and the Lilly CRP/CRS; thedecisio n will be 
docum ented in wri ting.  Intrapatient dose escalat ions are not permitted.
The example dose l evels for Part Aare shown in Table JOBA. 3.  Interm ediate or hi gher dose 
levels may be explored ,if deemed necessary ,after di scussio n between the Lilly  CRP/CRS and 
investigators. The toxicit y
-band method has the abilit y to accomm odate addi tional dose l evels 
naturally .
Details regarding the toxicity-band method for this study  are provided in Attachment 10 .
If, during dose escalation, a situation presents itself that is not described above ,Lilly CRP/CRS 
and invest igators will determine the best method to select the appropriate dose for the pat ient(s) 
involved,using all available informat ion. The decision will be documented in writ ing. No dose 
escalat ion can occur without prior discussio n and agreement between the site -specific 
investigator and the Lilly CRP/CRS. Written notificat ion will be sent to the si te specifying the 
dose to be used for each patient at each dose level.

Based on the ongoing safety  reviews, m odificat ions to the dose -escalat ion strategy  or other 
design elements may be made via protocol amendment to ensure patient safet y.
7.2.3. Dose Confirmation in Patients with Known Alteration sof 
FGFR3 (Part sB and C)
Once the MTD has been defined in Part A , Part sB (urothelial carcino ma) and C (other 
malignancies) will be act ivated and will enroll up to approximately [ADDRESS_1047403] or m ore of  patients during Cycle 1 (with a 
minimum o f 6 pati ents enrolled), the enrollment of new patients will cease unt il the Lilly 
CRP/CRS and investigators assess the severit y and nature of the toxicit ies.  A data review will be 
perform ed to determine whether to con tinue at the current LY3076226 dose or whether the dose 
of LY3076226 shoul d be reduced. The toxicit y-band method used in the dose -escalat ion phase 
will be updated with the additional data observed in Part s B and C to confirm the MTD selection 
and/or to i nform any need to further refine the MTD. This decisi on will be docum ented in 
writing.
7.2.4. Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)
TheRP2D will be determined after the complet ion of Parts B and C.  The RP2D will be agreed 
upon fo llowing discussio n between the invest i
gators and the Lilly CRP or CRS and will include 
an assessment of safet y, PK, and PD data. This will  not exceed the MTD.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047404] ions wi th any biological  agents, all  patients should 
continue to be closely mo nitored for si gns and symptom s indicat ive of an infusio n-related 
reacti on (IRR) both in the acute period (immediately or within 24 hours after dosing) and up to 
several days to a few weeks after dosing for delayed reactions. Acute assessments should 
include an assessment of vital signs starting at the time of init iation of the infusio n and 
continuing unt il at least [ADDRESS_1047405] igator. Monitoring shoul d be 
perform ed in an are a where resuscitat ion equipment and other agents ( for example , epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
corticosteroi ds) are readily  available.
Per the CTCAE v 4.[ADDRESS_1047406] igational therapy, investigators are encouraged to use the AE term 
“infusi on-related reaction ”and any  addi tional terms ,including those not listed here ,that best 
describe the event.
Secti on 7.2.6 provide streatm ent recommendat ions for IRRs .
If,at any  time ,a pati ent experiences an IRR to LY3076226, all attempts will be made to obtain a 
blood sam ple for immunogenicit y analysis as close to the onset of the event as possible, at the 
resol ution of the event, and 30 day s following the event.  A portion of  the sample taken for 
immunogenicit y testing may be used for PK analysis, in the setting of IRRs .
If IRRs are observed, premedicat ion with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (or equivalent), 
dexamethasone (or equivalent), or other medicat ions as medically indicated may be considered 
for future pati ents. The decision to implement premedicat ion for drug administration in 
subsequent patients will be made fo llowing a di scussio n between the invest igators and sponsor 
and will be documented in writ ing.

LY30762267.2.6. Dose Adjustments and Delays
[IP_ADDRESS]. General Dose Adjustments and Delays
Once a pat ient has had a dose reduction (has started a new cy cle at the reduced dose), all 
subsequent infusio ns will be at the reduced dose level; there will be no resumpt ion to pri or dose 
level(s).  Any pat ient experiencing toxicit y that woul d necessi tate m ore than [ADDRESS_1047407] di scont inue treatment .
The fo llowing cri teria shoul d guide dosing:
Before the start of each cycle ,the following parameters are required:
oHem atologic: ANC ≥1.5 × 109/L, platelets ≥100 × 109/L, and hemoglobin
≥8g/dL.   (In Part C only, patients with mult iple myelo ma are allowed the 
following:  ANC ≥1.0 × 109/L, pl atelets 50 × 10 9/L, and hemoglo bin 8g/dL.)
oNon-hematol ogic: AEs must resolve to CTCAE v 4.0 Grade ≤1 or baseline.   
Except ions will be made for: alopecia, fatigue, or other toxicit ies that can be
controlled with standard treatment; these toxicit ies must resolve to Grade ≤2.
If subsequent cycles ar e delayed by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_1047408] 
possibly  related to LY3076226 , the patient shoul d be rem oved f rom study  drug treatm ent 
and should co mplete subsequent follow -up.
If the patient is in Cycle [ADDRESS_1047409] igator, he/she is 
showing benefit from therapy and has recovered sufficient ly from the AE.
A delay  of no m ore than 7 days because of ho lidays, weekends, inclement weather, or 
other justifiable events will be permitted and will not be counted as a protocol deviat ion.
Table JOBA. 4presents LY3076226 dosing guidelines for managing AEs of concern, which may 
or may not be associ ated wi th LY3076226 therapy.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047410] occurrence Decrease LY3076226 infusion rate by 50% and mon itor closely for any 
worsening.
For subsequent infusion s, premedicate with diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride; additional premedication may be administered at the 
investigator's discretion.
Grade [ADDRESS_1047411] occurrence Stop LY3076226 infusion. Administer diphenhydramine hydrochl oride 
and acetaminophen for fever .  Supply oxygen. Resume infusion at 50% 
of previous rate once the infusion -related reaction has resolved or 
decreased to Grade 1 in severity, and monitor closely for any worsening.
For subsequent infusions, premedicate with diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride; additional premedi cation may be administered at the 
investigator's discretion. The reduced rate should be used for all 
subsequent infusions.
Grade 1 or 2 Second occurrence Administer dexamethasone.
Grade ≥[ADDRESS_1047412] infusion tubing from the 
patient.  Administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride, dexamethasone, 
bronchodilators for bronchospasm, and other medications/treatment as 
medically indicated.
Patients must not receive any further LY3076226 t reatment.
Other Toxicities
Grade ≥[ADDRESS_1047413] occurrence Delay LY3076226 treatment until Grade ≤1 or baseline following the 
rules in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Based on the investigator's discretion, the full 
dose of LY3076226 may be administered or the dose may be reduced to 
the next lowest dose level.  If the event recurs at the same grade, then
dose reduce LY3076226 to the next lowest dose level.
Grade ≥3 Second occurrence Delay LY3076226 treatment until Grade ≤1 or baseline following the 
rules in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Dose reduce LY3076226 to the next lowest 
dose level.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 41
LY30762267.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment
Patients who m eet all cri teria for enrollment will be assigned to receive LY3076226.  B efore 
each patient’s enrollment into the study , an eligibilit y check m ust be conducted between the 
investigat ional site and the Lilly clinical research personnel to confirm that each patient meets all 
enrollment criteria.  Upon confir mation of eligibility , the sponsor will confirm the dose and 
ident ificat ion number assignment and cohort for each pat ient.  No dose escalat ions (that is, to the 
next cohort) can occur without prior discussio n and agreem ent wi th the responsible Lilly
CRP /CRS.
If invest igators have eligible pat ients who have consented concurrent ly, more than the minimum 
number of patients for a cohort (1 or 
3)may be entered at a particular dose level ifaccrual has 
not ceased due to excessive toxicit y.  This enrollment procedure is allowed because of the 
advanced disease state of this patient population and the screening invo lved in defining 
eligibilit y.  This event should be approved by [CONTACT_764510].
7.4. Blinding
This is an open -label study .
7.5. Concomitant Therapy
In the absence of clinical experience with LY3076226, patients should be closely evaluated to 
ensure i dentificat ion of exacerbat ions of known side effects of conco mitant m edicat ions.  These 
shoul d be reported immediately to the sponsor .
No other chemotherapy , radi otherapy , immunotherapy , cancer -related horm one therapy , or 
experimental drugs will be permitted while the patients are on this study . The need for any form 
of radiotherapy  (including palliat ive) will be cause for early discont inuat ion from the study . In 
addition, any disease progression requiring other forms of specific ant itumor therapy will also 
necessita te early  discontinuat ion from the study .  Appropriate documentation for all forms of 
prem edicat ions, supportive care, and conco mitant medicat ions m ust be captured on the CRF .  
Replacement hormonal therapy  will be allowed.   
Patients on stable doses of bisph osphonates are 
allowed to continue.
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( for example, ketoconazole, itraconazo le, 
clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, 
and voriconazo le) with LY3076226 shoul d be avo ided due to the potential for an increase in 
DM4 exposure and toxicit y. Where possible, c onsider an alternate medicat ion with no or 
minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers ( for 
example, avasimibe [not c ommercially available ],carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenyto in, rifampin, and St. 
John’s wort ) with LY3076226 shoul d be avo ided due to the potential for a decrease in DM4 
exposure and potentially efficacy. Where possible, c onsider an alternate medicat ion with no or 
minimal potential to induce CYP3A4. Concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors ( for 
example, bupropi [INVESTIGATOR_2394], fluoxet ine,paroxetine, and quinidine ) with LY3076226 shoul d be avo ided 
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 42
LY3076226dueto the potential for an increase in DM4 exposure and toxicit y. Where poss ible, c onsider an 
alternate medicat ion with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP 2D6.Refer to the Food and 
Drug Administration ( FDA )website for a complete list 
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteracti
onsLa beling/ucm093664.htm ).
Patients shoul d receive full supportive care with the except ion that the routine use of granulocyte 
colony-stimulat ing factor (G -CSF) is not permitted during this study . Patients should not receive 
G-CSF prophylact ically in any cycle.  G -CSF m ay only  be used for pati ents who have ANC
<0.5109/L, neutropenic fever, or documented infect ions while neutropenic.  G- CSF m ust be 
discontinued at least 24 hours before the start of the next cycle of treatment.  Should the use of 
hematopo ietic co lony-stimulating factors (CSFs) be necessary, fo llow the American Societ y of 
Clinical Onco logy (ASCO) recommendat ions for the use of CSFs (Smit h et al . 2006).  If 
clinically indicated at any  time during the study , erythropoi etin and packed red bloo d cell

7.6.1. Evaluable Patients
Patients who wi thdraw from  the study  before receiving study  drug will be replaced and will not 
be included in the safet y or efficacy assessments.  Safet y analyses wil l be conducted on all 
patients who have received at least onedose of study  drug, regardl ess of whether they  are 
deem ed evaluable for the assessment of a dose level.
Any pat ient who i s discont inued fro m the study  before com pleting onecycle of  LY3076226
treatment maybe deemed non -evaluable for assessment of a dose level, unless they  experience a 
DLT prior to withdrawal.
Patients who receive LY3076226 on Cycle 1, Day  1 (C1D1 )but discontinue from study 
treatm ent before the end of Cycle 1will be considered evaluable for the assessment of a dose 
level provided it can be documented if the pati ent experience da DLT within [ADDRESS_1047415] igator(s) and the Lilly CRP /CRS to ensure adequate PK data,
unless accrual to that cohort has stopped due to a DLT.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047416] ion of blood and urine samples , are 
described in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
Standard labo ratory  tests, including chemistry, hematology , coagul ation and urinalysis panels , 
will be performed.  Aserum pregnancy test will be administered if applicable.  Other clinical 
laboratory  tests will also be collected.   Attachment [ADDRESS_1047417] to 
follow-up.  Frequency  of AEand SAE follow

unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal la boratory  finding), symptom, or 
disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of m edicinal (invest igational) product, whether or not 
related to the medicinal (invest igational) product.   Any clinically  significant findings from labs, 
vital sign m easurements, an d so on, that occur should also be reported to Lilly or its designee as 
an AE.  Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies because the purpose of the clinical 
study  is to establish drug effect.
The invest igator, monitor, and sponsor will review t he collected data regularly for evidence of 
AEs.  All pat ients will be assessed routinely for AEs as outlined in the study  schedule.  All AEs 
observed will be graded using CTCAE v 4.0.
The National Cancer Inst itute (NCI) -CTCAE v 4.0 will serve as the refer ence docum ent for 
choosing appropriate termino logy for, and grading the severit y of, all AEs and other symptom s. 
All AEs observed will be graded using CTCAE v 4.0.  Any minor versio n of CTCAE v 4.0 (for 
example, version 4.0X) may  be used for thi s study .  Minor CTCAE v 4.[ADDRESS_1047419] ing the appropriate

both CTCAE term (actual or coded) and severit y grade m ust be selected by  [CONTACT_764511].  This collect ion is in addit ion to verbatim text used to describe the AE .
In addit ion to collect ing the AE verbat im, the CTCAE term, and the CTCAE severit y grade, AE 
verbat im text will also be mapped by [CONTACT_92354] (MedDRA) dict ionary.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study  drug shoul d be 
reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding should be collected, if feasible, for regulatory 
reporting and drug safet y evaluat ion.
Upon docum entati on of pregnancy , the pati ent m ust be rem oved from  the study  and treatment 
with study  drug m ust be stopped immediately .
For all enrolled pat ients, study  site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of each 
patient’s preexist ing condit ions, including clin ically significant signs and symptoms of the 
disease under treatment in the study .  While the pati ent is on study , site personnel will record any  
change in these preexist ing condit ion(s) and the occurrence and nature of any  AEs.  In addit ion 
all AEs related to protocol  procedures are reported to Lilly or desi gnee.
If a patient ’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to Lilly or its desi gnee via electronic data entry  the ci rcumstances 
and data leading to any  such dosage reducti on or discontinuat ion of treatm ent.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047420] igators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure and/or study drug via electronic data entry .
The invest igator decides whether he or she interprets the observed AEs as ei ther rel ated to 
disease, to the study  medicat ion, study  procedure, or other concomitant treatment or pathologies.  
To assess the relat ionship of the AE to the study  drug, the fo llowing termino logies are defined:
Related :  a di rect cause and effect relat ionship between the study  treatm ent and 
the AE i s likely.
Possibly related :  a cause and effect relat ionship between the study  treatm ent and 
the AE has not been demonstrated at this time and is not probable, but is also not 
impossible.
Unrelated :  without questi on, the AE i s defini tely not associ ated wi th the study  
treatm ent.
As per Lilly’s standard operating procedures ,all “related” and “possibly  related” AEs and SAEs 
will be defined as related to study  drug.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events
Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has 
worsened during the course of the study .
Planned hospi [INVESTIGATOR_574417]’s medical history  at the time of study enrollment shoul d not be 
considered SAEs.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338253] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_454828] (for exa mple, for the administration of study  treatm entor other protocol -requi red 
procedure) should not be considered SAEs.
An SAE is any  AEduring thi s study  that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es:
death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094] (except for study  drug 
administration)
a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  [CONTACT_92355].
Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_338255], based on appropriate medical judgment, they  
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent one of the 
outcom es listed in this definit ion.
Serious adverse events due to disease progression, including death, should not be reported unless 
the invest igator deems them to be possibly related to the study  drug.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047421] igator becomes aware of SAEs occurring after the patient’s participation in the trial 
has ended, and the invest igator believes that the SAE i s related to a protocol procedure or study  
drug, the invest igator should report the SAEs to the sponsor and the SAEs will be entered in the
Lilly Safety  System .
Inform ation on SAEs expected in the study  popul ation independent of drug exposure and that 
willbe assessed by  [CONTACT_92356].
Refer to Attachment 6 for recommendat ions for reporti ng SAEs.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Reporting
Data on SAEs that occur before the end of trial will be stored in the col lection database and the 
Lilly Safety  System .
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Prior to Administration of Study Drug
During prescreening and screening, all AEs and SAEs (regardless of relatedness to protocol 
procedures) are collected after the patient has signed the ICF.  For pati ents who do not enroll in 
the trial (that i s, have not receive dat least onedose of study  treatm ent), only  AEs and SAEs 
related to protocol  procedures are required to be collected.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. On-Study Treatment
All AEs and SAEs, regardless of relatedness to study  drug or protocol procedures, occurring 
while the patient is receiving study  drug m ust be reported to Lilly or its designee.  A patient is 
considered to be receiving study  drug from  the time he/she receives the first dose of study  drug 
to when he/s he receives the last dose of study  drug.
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Follow -Up Visit
All AEs and SAEs , regardl ess of relatedness to study  drug or protocol procedures, occurring 
during the fo llow-up visit (Visit 801) must be reported to Lilly or its designee .  The fo llow -up 
visit begins the day  after the pati ent and the invest igator agree that the patient will no longer 
continue study  treatm ent.  The durati on of  the fo llow-up visit is 28 ±[ADDRESS_1047422] specific sa fety assessments ( Attachment 1).  
If it is deemed to be in the best interest of the patient to start a new ant i-cancer treatment prior to 
the schedu led end of the fo llow-up visit, the fo llow
-up vi sit durati on may  be shortened. In this 
case, the fo llow-up assessments should be co mpleted prior to the init iation of the new therapy.
Following the safet y assessments, which mark the end of the fo llow-up vi sit (Visit 801), the 
patient will be discont inued fro m the study , unless there is an ongoing AE or SAE that is 
possibly  related to study  drug.  In thi s instance, the pati ent shoul d be f ollowed unt il the event is 
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047423] to 
follow-up.
After the fo llow-up visit (Visit 801), AEs are not required to be reported unless the invest igator 
feels the AEs were related to either study  drug, drug delivery  system , or a protocol  procedure. If 
an invest igator becomes aware of an SAE believed to be related to protocol procedures or study  
drug, the invest igator should report the SAE to the sponsor, and the SAE will be entered in the 
Lilly Safety  System .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are SAE s that are not listed in the
DCSI intheIB and that the invest igator ident ifies as related to study drug or procedure.  The 
[LOCATION_002] 21 Code of Federal Regulat ions (CFR )312.32, the European Unio n Clinical Trial 
Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidance or nati onal r egulatory  requi rements 
in parti cipat ing countries require the reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs.  Lilly has procedures that will be 
followed for the recording and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with global 
regul atory  regulat ionsand the associated detailed guidance .

LY30762268.1.3. Other Safety Measures
[IP_ADDRESS]. Electrocardiograms
For each patient, a12-lead di gital ECG will  be collected according to the Study  Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ).  Patients must be supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -recumbent for approximately [ADDRESS_1047424] ion.
During Cycle 1, triplicate ECGs (consecut ive replicate ECGs at approximately 1 -minute 
intervals) will be done as specified in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ). Beginning with 
Cycle 2 and beyo nd, only a single ECG will be required. Electrocardi ograms m ay be obtained at 
additional times,when deemed clinically necessary .Collection of more ECGs (more replicates)
than expected at a particular time point is allo wed to ensure high -quali ty records.
Electrocardiograms will be interpreted by  a qualified physician ( the investigator or qualified 
desig nee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the 
patient is st ill present, to determine whether the patient meets entry  criteria at the rel evant visit(s) 
and for immediate patient management, should any clinicall y relevant findings be identified.
If a clinically significant quantitative or qualitat ive change fro m baseline is ident ified after 
enrollment, the investigator will assess the patientfor symptom s (for example, pal pi[INVESTIGATOR_814], near 
syncope, syncope) to dete rmine whether the patientcan continue in the study .  The invest igator 
or qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change in patientmanagement i s 
needed and must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluat ion from at 
least oneof the replicate ECGs from each t ime point.
Digital ECGs will be electroni cally transmitted to a central ECG laboratory  designated by  [CONTACT_11007] .  
The central ECG laboratory  will perf orm a basic quali ty control  check (for example, 
demographics and stu dy details) then store the ECGs in a database.  At a future time, the stored 
ECG data may be overread at the central ECG laboratory  for further eval uation of  machine -read 
measurements or t o meet regulatory  requi rements.
The m achine -read ECG intervals and h eart rate m ay be used for data analysis and report writing 
purposes unless an overread of the ECGs is conducted prior to complet ion of the final study  
report (i n which case the overread data would be used).
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 51
LY30762268.1.4. Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CRP /CRS will monitor safet y data throughout the course of the study .
Representatives from Lilly Glo bal Patient Safet y will specifically  monitor SAEs.  Lilly will 
review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by [CONTACT_365203].
Ophthalmo logist may  perform addi tional exam inatio ns when visual changes or other ocular 
symptoms occur ,at their discret ion as clinically  indicated.
Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory  
test abnorm alities. Potential for biliary ob structi on shoul d be assessed. To ensure patient safet y 
and co mply with regul atory  guidance, the invest igator is to consult with the Lilly CRP/CRS
regarding collect ion of specific reco mmended clinical informat ion and fo llow-up laboratory  tests 
(see Attachm ent 3 ).  If a study  patient experiences concurrent elevated ALT >3× ULN and 
elevated total  bilirubin >2 × ULN, clinical and laboratory  monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by  [CONTACT_1275].   If this is determined to be in the absence o f biliary  obstructi on or other causes than 
can reasonably explain the concurrent elevat ion, then the patient should be discont inued from 
LY3076226.
8.1.5. Complaint Handling
Lillycollects complaints on study  drugs used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of 
study  participants, m onitor quali ty, and f acilitate process and product improvements.
Com plaint s related to concomitant drugs are reported directly to the manuf acturers of those 
drugs in accordance with the package insert.
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the 
complaint process in accordance with the instructions provided for this study :
recording a comple te descri ption of the complaint reported and any associated AE
using the study -specific complaint forms provided for this purpose
faxing the completed complaint form within [ADDRESS_1047425] igation, he/she will return a copy  of the

LY3076226OPTIONAL
Optional samples for bi omarker research that should be collected from pat ients in the study ,
where possible ,include:
PartsA, B, and C
oArchived tumor tissue ( refer to Secti on 8.2.3 )
If a patient has archived tum or tissue previously taken to evaluate the patient’s disease, a small 
amount of this tissue will be requested , if available, for biomarker research.
Parts B and C only
oPosttreatm ent tissue biops y(refer to Secti on 8.2.2 )
Blood, urine , and t issue samples will be co llected to determine whether patients meet 
inclusio n/excl usion criteria and to m onitor pati ent heal th.
Standard laboratory  tests, including hematology  and urinalysis panels, will be performed and 
analyzed by a local laboratory . Chemistry  panels will  be perform ed and analyzed centrally. 
Enrollment or dose adjust ment deci sions m ay be based upon chemistry  resul ts perf ormed at a 
local laboratory; however, a sample must be sent to the central lab oratory . These central 
chemistry  laboratory  resul ts will be used for subsequent safet y analyses. In the event of minor 
discrepancies between local and central laboratory  resul ts, the investi gator m ay use the l ocal 
resul ts for treatm ent decisio ns, and the central laboratory  resul ts will  remain part of the safet y 
database. Discrepancies between local a nd central results that may have an impact on treatment 
decisio ns will not be considered protocol vio lations.
Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory  safety  report.
Samples co llected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed wit hin [ADDRESS_1047427] results.  Tests are run and confirmed prompt ly whenever scient ifically 
appropriate.  When scientific circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain samples 
to batch the tests run, or to retain the samples until the end of the study  to confirm  that the resul ts 
are valid.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h 
applicable laws, regulat ions, or l aboratory  certificati on standards.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047428] ion and handling of blood samples will be provided by [CONTACT_456].  The actual date and 
time ( 24-hour clock time ) of each sampling will be recorded.
These s amples will be analyzed at laboratori es designated by  [CONTACT_456].  Pl asma concentrations
of conjugated LY3076226 andtotal LY3076226 IgG will be assayed using validated ELISA 
method s
.  Plasma concentrations of DM4 and DM4 -Me will be assayed using a validated LC -MS 
assay.
The PK samples will be stored at a facilit y designated by  [CONTACT_764512] i n the 
[LOCATION_002] .
The rem aining pl asma f rom the sam ples collected for PKmay be pooled and used for 
exploratory  metabo lism work as deemed appropriate.
Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure invest igational product concentration will be retained 
for a maximum of [ADDRESS_1047429] and apopto sis.  Tissue biopsy may be taken by  
[CONTACT_122638] e biopsy  and/or surgical  biopsy  (pretreatment and posttreatment fresh tumor biopsies 
in Part s B and C).  Due diligence should be used to ensure that tumor specimen (not normal 
adjacent or tum or margins) is prov ided.  Pathology notes accompanying the tissue may also be 
requested.
Bioanaly tical tissue samples co llected to measure Ki-67, pHH3, and caspase 3 will be identified 
by [CONTACT_491548] (coded) and retained for a maximum o f 15yearsor until  testing i s

LY30762268.2.3. Samples for Exploratory Biomarker s
Exploratory  analysis may be conducted using blood (including ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
[EDTA ]plasma ), urine, and tumor ti ssue to explore potential bio markers related to LY3076226
mechanism o f action,the FGFR3 pathway ,DM4 mechanism o f action, and thecancer 
pathobi ology, to better understand relat ionship with clinical  outcom es.  Tumor tissue samples 
may be analyzed to explore potential tumor gene signature(s) associated with response or 
resistance to LY 3076226 therapy .  These studi es may be analyzed at a laboratory  designated by  
[CONTACT_764514], fluorescen cein situ hybridizat ion (FISH) for copy  
number amplificat ions, ribonucleic acid ( RNA )gene-expressi on profiling, and/or genetic 
analyses o f the tumor specimen deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ). Such analyses may emplo y 
targeted or high -throughput sequencing approaches.
8.2.4. Sample sfor Pharmacogenetic Research
There i s growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy .  
Variable response to therapy  may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, 
distribut ion, metabo lism, and e xcretion, the mechanism of act ion of the drug, the disease 
etiology,and/or the molecular subt ype of the di sease being treated.  Therefore, where local 
regul ations and ERBs allo w, a bl ood sam ple will be collected for pharmacogenet ic analysis.   In 
the event of an unexpected AE or the observation of unusual response, the pharmacogenet ic 
biomarker samples may  be genoty ped and analysis may  be perform ed to eval uate a genet ic 
associ ation with response to study  drug.  These investigations may be limited to a focus ed 
candidate gene study  or, if appropri ate, genom e-wide analysis may be performed to identify 
regions of the genome associated with the variability  observed in drug response.  The 
pharmacogenet ic biomarker samples will only  be used for invest igations rel ated to di sease and 
drug or class o f drugs under study  in the context of this clinical program.  They  will not be used 
for broad expl oratory  unspecified disease or population genet ic analysis.
The samples will be coded with the patient number and stored for up to a maximum [ADDRESS_1047431] pati ent vi sit for the study  at a f acility selected by  [CONTACT_456].  The samples and any 
data generated from them can only be linked back to the patient by  [CONTACT_240241].  
The durati on allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory  requests related to the study  drug.
Samples will  be destroy ed according to a process consistent with local regulat ion.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047432] anti -drug ant ibodies (ADA) in the presence o f 
study  drug .  Ant ibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for their abilit y to 
neutralize the activit y of study  drug .
In addit ion to pl anned sampling for immunogenicit y testing, if at a ny time a patient experiences 
an IRR to study  drug, all attem pts will be made to obtain a blood sample for immunogenicit y 
analysis as close to the onset of the event as possible, at the resolution of the event, and [ADDRESS_1047433] ive of the study  is to docum ent any ant itumor activit y.  Ref er to Attachment 1
for details regarding the timing of specific efficacy measures.
Each patient will be assessed by  [CONTACT_45332] m ore of the fo llowing radi ologic tests for tum or 
measurement:
Com puted tom ography  (CT)scan
Magnet ic resonance imaging ( MRI )
Forlympho ma patients only, positron emissio n tom ography  (PET)/CT i s permitted if 
appropriate for standard of care (Cheson et al. 20 14)
Each patient’s full extent of disease 
will also be assessed with:
Tumor measurement by  [CONTACT_393] 1.1 (Ei senhauer et al. 2009) ,internat ional 
uniform  response criteria for mult iple myelo ma (Rajkumar et al . 2011 ), or 
response criteria for lympho mas(Cheson et al. 2014).
Evaluat ion of tumor mark ers, if indicated.
Evaluat ion of performance status (refer to the ECOG scale, Attachment 7 )
.

may be log -transformed prior to summarizing ,if necessary . The interpatient and intrapatient 
variabilit y of the PD m arkers may  also be assessed where appropriate .
Ifthe data allow, a PK/PD analysis may  also be perform ed, wherein PD data from  all pat ients 
woul d be analyzed using linear and/or nonlinear fixed and mixed effects models as appropriate.
10.7. Immunogen icity Analyses
Immu nogenicit y data will be summarized by [CONTACT_2715], drug concentrations, and t ime from dose.
Ifthe data allow, immunogenicit y data f rom all patients m ay also be analyzed using linear and/or 
nonlinear fixed and mixed effects models as appropriate.
10.8. Efficacy
The study  isnot desi gned to m ake an efficacy assessment.  However, any  tumor response data 
will be tabulated .  Particularly , the antitumor effect will be summarized by [CONTACT_764518] (ORR). A patient is considered to have a tumor response if they achieve a confirmed CR or 
PRaccording to RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al. 2009) or lympho ma criteria (Cheson et al. 2014);
or a confirmed stringent complete response ( sCR), CR, very good parti al response ( VGPR ), or
PR according to multip le myelo ma(IMWG) criteria (Rajkumar et al . 2011 ). The ORR will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_764519] (CR+PR) 
by [CONTACT_764520]. A 90% exact CIwill be constructed to determine the 
level of precisio n of the tumor response rate. Time -to-event variables will also be tabulated. For 
PFS and duration of response, the Kaplan -Meier method (Kaplan and Meier 1958) will be used 
to estimate the survival curves, median s,and survival rates if applicable .
10.9. Tailoring Biomarker
Biomarker assessments in this study  will focus on ident ifying markers and/or marker signatures 
that may  indicate the patients most likely  to respond or be resi stant to LY3076226. Exploratory  
analysis may  be conducted using blood, urine, and tumor tissue to explore potential b iomarkers 
related to LY3076226 mechanism o f action, the FGFR3 pathway, DM4 m echanism  of action, 
and the cancer pathobio logy, to better understand relat ionship wit h clinical outcomes.  Tumor 
tissue samples may  be analyzed to expl ore potenti al tumor gene signature(s) associated with 
response or resistance to LY3076226 therapy .
In all analyses, adjust ments may be made to account for other baseline pat ient characteristics, 
safet y, and PK/PD data. Unless otherwise stated, given the small sample sizes invo lved, 
statist ical analyses results will be considered explo ratory  and will not consider mult iple 
comparison adjust ments.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047439] or m ore of pati ents during 
Cycle 1 (with a minimum o f 6 pati ents enrolled), a data review will be performed to determine 
whether to continue at th e current LY3076226 dose or whether the dose of LY3076226 should 
be reduced. Refer to Section 7.2.3 for more details.
If an unplanned interim analy sis is deemed necessary , the sponsor will determine if it is 
necessary  to am end the protocol .

Response Criteria
PDa,d Increase of 25% from lowest response value in any of following:
serum M -component (absolute increase must be ≥0.5 g/dL; serum M -component increases ≥1 g/dL are sufficient to 
define relapse if starting M component ≥5 g/dL )
urine M - component (absolute increase must be ≥200 mg/24 h)
only in patients without measurable serum and urine M -protein levels:  the difference between involved and uninvolved 
FLC levels (absolute increase must be >10 mg/dL)
only in patients without measurable serum and urine M -protein levels and without measurable disease by [CONTACT_764524] : 
bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute percentage must be ≥10%)
Definite d evelopment of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas, or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or 
soft tissue plasmacytomas
Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium >11.5 mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell 
proliferative disorder
Clarification :  Bone marrow cr iteria for PD are to be used only in patients without measurable disease by M -protein and by [CONTACT_764525]; “25% increase” refers to M -protein, FLC, and bone marrow results and does not refer to bone lesions, soft tissue 
plasmacytomas, or hypercalcemia, and t he “lowest response value” does not need to be a confirmed value.

complete response; SD = stable disease; VGPR = very good partial response.
aAll response categories (CR, sCR, VGPR, PR, and PD) require 2 consecu tive assessments made at any time before the institution of any new therapy.
bCR, sCR, VGPR, PR, and SD also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were perf ormed.
cVGPR and CR categories require serum and ur ine studies regardless of whether disease at baseline was measurable on serum, urine, both, or neither.  CR, 
sCR, VGPR, PR, and SD also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performe d.
dRadiographic stud ies are not required to satisfy these response requirements.  Bone marrow assessments need not be confirmed.

I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase [ADDRESS_1047480] Criteria 1.1
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study  using the international criteria proposed 
by [CONTACT_92378] (RECIST): Revised RECIST 
Guideline ( version 1.1; Eisen hauer et al. 2009).
Measurability of Tumor at Baseline
Tumor lesi ons/lymph nodes will be categorized at baseline as measurable or nonmeasurable.  
Measurable disease is defined by  [CONTACT_92379] l east 1 m easurable l esion.
Measurable 
Tumor lesi ons:  Measured in at least 1 dimensio n (longest di ameter in the plane o f measurement 
is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10 mm by  [CONTACT_92380]  (CT) or m agnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) 
scan (slice thickness 5 mm)
10 mm caliper measurement by  [CONTACT_110704] (non -measurable lesio ns if cannot 
be accurately measured with calipers)
[ADDRESS_1047481] X -ray
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node m ust be [ADDRESS_1047482] scan (CT scan thickness recommended 
to be 5 mm ).
Nonmeasurable 
All other lesio ns, including small lesio ns (lo ngest di ameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with 10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly nonmeas urable l esions.  Lesi ons considered truly  
non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusio ns, 
lymphangitis cut is/pulmo nis, inflammatory  breast di sease, lymphangit is involvement of skin or 
lung, abdo minal masses/abdo mina l organom egaly ident ified by [CONTACT_92381].
Special Considerations for Lesion Measurability
Bone l esions:
Bone scan, positron emissio n tom ography ( PET)scan,or plain films are not 
considered adequ ate imaging techniques to measure bone lesio ns.
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic-blastic l esions, wit h ident ifiable so ft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by  [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging techniques such as 
CT or MRI, can be considered measurable lesio nsif the so ft tissue com ponent 
meets the definit ion of measurabilit y.
Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 94
LY3076226Cystic lesions:
Simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesio ns (neither measurable 
nor nonm easurable) 
Cystic lesions thought to repre sent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesio ns, if they meet the definit ion of measurabilit y.  If noncyst ic 
lesions are presented in the same patients, these are preferred for select ion as 
target lesio ns.
Lesio ns wi th Prior Local Treatm ent:
Tumor lesi ons situated at a previ ously i rradiated area, or i n an area subjected 
to other loco -regional therapy, are non -measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesio n.
Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesion
Target Lesions
When more than 1 measurable lesio n is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum o f 5 
lesions total  (and a m aximum  of 2 lesio ns per organ) representative o f all invo lved organs should 
be ident ified as target lesio ns and will be recorded and measured at baseline. Non-nodal Target 
lesions shoul d be selected on the basis o f their size (l esions with the l ongest di ameter), be 
representative of all invo lved organs, and can be reproduced in repeated measurements.  
Measurable lymph nodes are target lesions if they meet the criteria of a short axis of [ADDRESS_1047483] scan.  All measurements are to be recorded in the case re port form (CRF) in millimeters (or 
decimal fract ions of centimeters [cm]).
Non-target Lesions
All other lesio ns (or sites of disease) are identified as non -target l esions(chosen based on their 
representativeness o f involved organs and the ability to be reproduced in repeated measurements) 
and should be recorded at baseline.  Measurement of these lesio ns are not required but should be 
followed as ‘present,’ ‘absent,’ or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression.’  In addit ion, it is 
possible to record mult iple non-target l esions involving the same organ as a single item on the 
CRF (for example, mult iple liver m etastases recorded as one live r lesi on).
Lymph nodes with short axis 10 mm  but <[ADDRESS_1047484] a short axis <10 mm are considered nonpathological and are not recorded or 
followed.
Specifications by [CONTACT_92383], using a ruler or calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluat ions should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatm ent and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatm ent.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
ident ified and reported lesio n at baseline and during fo llow-up.  Im aging- based evaluat ion 
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 95
LY3076226shoul d always be done rather than clinical examination unless th e lesion(s) being fo llowed 
cannot be imaged but are assessed by [CONTACT_461].
An adequate vo lume of a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are 
demonstrated to best effect and a consistent method is used on subsequent examinat ionsfor any  
given pat ient.  If prior to enrollment it is known a patient is not able to undergo CT scans with IV 
contrast due to allergy  or renal  insufficiency , the decisi on as to whether a non -contrast CT or 
MRI (wi th or wi thout IV contrast) should be used t o evaluate the patient at baseline and fo llow-
up shoul d be guided by  [CONTACT_240265].
Clinical Lesions:  Clinical lesio ns will only be considered measurable when they  are superficial  
and 10 mm di ameter as assessed using calipers (for example, skin nodules).  For the case of 
skin lesio ns, docum entati on by [CONTACT_92385] , incl uding a rul er to estimate the size of the 
lesion is recommended.  When lesio ns can be evaluated by  [CONTACT_51752], 
imaging evaluat ion should be undertaken since it is more object ive and may be reviewed at the 
end of the study .
Chest X -ray:  Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray when progressi on is an important endpoint.  
Lesio ns on chest X -ray may be consider ed m easurable if they  are cl early  defined and surrounded 
by [CONTACT_92387] l ung.
CT and MRI :  CT scan is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesio ns 
selected for response assessment.  Measurabilit y of lesio ns on CT scan is based on the
assumpt ion that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1047485] slice thickness >5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesio n shoul d be twi ce the slice thickness.  MRI is also 
acceptable in certain situations (for example, for body  scans).  If there is concern about radiat ion 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound should not be used to measure lesion size.  Ultrasound examinat ions 
cannot be reproduced in their ent irety for independent review at a late r date and, because they  are 
operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be 
taken fro m one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by  [CONTACT_92388] , confi rmation by [CONTACT_12154].
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy :  The utilizat ion of these techniques for object ive tumor evaluat ion is 
not advised.  However, such techniques can be useful to confirm co mplete pathol ogical response 
when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence fo llowing com plete 
response or surgical resect ion is an endpo int.
Tumor Markers :  Tum or markers al one cannot be used to assess tumor response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they  must norm alize for a pat ient to be considered in 
complete response (CR).  Specific guidelines for both prostate -specific ant igen (PSA) response 
(in recurrent prostate cancer) and CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) have been 
published .
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 96
LY3076226Cytology, Histology :  These techni ques can be used to different iate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete response (CR) in rare cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for example, residual 
lesions in tum or types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can 
remain).  When effusi ons are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (for example, 
with certain taxane co mpounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmat ion of the 
neopl astic ori gin o f any effusio n that appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if 
the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease (SD) in order to different iate 
between response (or SD) and progressive disease (PD).
Pet Scan (FDG -PET, PET CT) :  PET is not recommended for lesio n assessment. If a new l esion 
is found by  [CONTACT_10052], another assessment must be done by  [CONTACT_4654], unless the PET CT i s of diagnostic 
qualit y.  If CT is done to confirm the results of the earlier PET scan, the date of progression must 
be reported as the earlier date of the PET scan.
Bone Scan :  If lesions measured by [CONTACT_92390], it is necessary to repeat 
the bone scan when trying to ident ify a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in target 
disease or when progression in bone is suspected.
Response Criteria
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance o f all target lesio ns.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to <[ADDRESS_1047486] norm alized.
Partial Respon se (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum o f diameter of target l esions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the smallest s um on study  (including the baseline sum if that is the smallest).  
In addit ion to the relat ive increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an abso lute increase 
of at least 5 mm.   The appearance of one or more new lesio ns is also considered progression.
For equivocal findings of progression (for example, very  small  and uncertain new l esions; cyst ic 
changes or necrosis in exist ing lesions), treatment may cont inue unt il the next scheduled 
assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is conf irmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progressio n was suspected.
Stable Disease (SD):   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while o n study .
Not Evaluable:  When an inco mplete radio logic assessment of target lesio ns is performed or 
there is a change in the method of measurement from baseline that impact sthe abilit y to make a 
reliable evaluat ion of response .
Evaluation of Non -target Le sions
Complete Response:   Disappearance of all non -target l esions and norm alizat ion of tum or marker 
level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathol ogical or norm al in size (<10 mm short axi s).
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 97
LY3076226Non-CR/ non -PD:  Persistence of 1 or more non -target l esions and/or maintenance o f tumor 
marker l evel above the norm al limits.
Progressive Disease:  Unequivocal progression o f exist ing non-target l esions.  The appearance 
of 1 or m ore new l esions i s also considered progressio n.
Not Evaluable : When a change in method of mea surem ent from baseline occurs and impacts the 
abilit y to make a reliable evaluat ion of response .
Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded fro m the start of the study  treatment until 
the earliest of object ive progression or start of new anticancer therapy, taking into accoun t any  
requi rement for confirmat ion.  The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the 
findings of both target and non
-target di sease and will also take into considerat ionthe 
appearance of new lesio ns.  The Best Overall Response will be calculated via an algorithm using 
the assessment responses provided by [CONTACT_92391].
Time Point Response
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified t ime point, a response assessment occurs.  ( When no 
imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not evaluable [NE]at 
that time po int.)  Table [ADDRESS_1047487] measurable disease at baseline.

reasonab le.  Normally, all target and non -target si tes are evaluated at each assessment using the 
same m ethod.  However, bone scans may need to be repeated only when CR is ident ified in 
target disease or when progression in bone is suspected.
Confirmatory Measurem ent/Duration of Response
Confirmation :
The m ain goal  of confirmat ion of object ive response in clinical trials is to avoid overest imating 
the response rate observed. The confirmat ion of response is particularly important in 
nonrandomized trials where respo nse (CR/PR) is the primary endpoint.  In this setting, to be 
assigned a status of PR/CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_62442] [ADDRESS_1047490] occur; assessment of 
non-targets is not required.
However, in randomized trial (Phase 2 or 3) or studies where SD or progression is the primary 
endpo ints, confirmat ion of response is not required.  But, eliminat ion of the requirement may  
increase the impo rtance of central review to protect against bias, in particular of studies which 
are not blinded.
In the case of SD, fo llow-up m easurements m ust have met the SD criteria at least once after start 
of treatm ent at a minimum interval not less than [ADDRESS_1047491] met for 
CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that disease is recurrent or object ive 
progres sion is observed (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded on 
study ).

Duration of Stable Disease
Stabl e disease is m easured from  the start of the treatment (in rando mized trials, from date of 
rando mizat ion) unt il the criteria for objective progressio n are m et, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study  (if the baseline sum is the smallest, that is the reference for calculat ion of 
PD).
Independent Review of Response and Progression
When object ive response (CR + PR) is the primary endpo int, and when key drug development 
decisio ns are based on the observat ion of a minimum n umber of responders, it is recommended 
that all claimed responses be reviewed by [CONTACT_13461](s) independent of the study .  If the study  is a

background of a model -based dose -escalation method and toxicity-band design 
(Neuenschwander et al. 2008) and describes the key elements for this trial.  Simulat ion results 
from the tox icity-band design are presented.  These results are also compared with that from the 
simulat ion of tradit ional 3+3 design to demonstrate the benefit of implement ing a toxicit y-band 
design in this trial.  Fixed and Adapt ive Clinical Trial Simulator (FACTS) software version 3.5 is 
used for all the simulat ions.
Introduction toContinual Reassessment Method (C RM)Approaches
The continual reassessment method (CRM; O’Quigl ey et al . 1990) is the first Bayesian model -
based approach developed for dose -escalat ion studies.  Compared to the tradit ional 3+[ADDRESS_1047494] ics of CRM, Goodman et al. (1995), among others, have proposed modified
CRM (MCRM) procedures to make the model -based designs more acceptable in pract ice.  The 
major m odificat ions include:
Always start at the lowest dose level.
Limit the escalat ion increme nt.
Escal ate by [CONTACT_764526].
Babb et al . (1998) proposed the escalat ion-with-overdose -control  method (EWOC) that direct ly 
control s the probabilit y of overdosing during dose escalat ion.  EWOC is also a CRM -type 
method.  During the e scalat ion, EWOC selects the next dose such that the predicted probabilit y 
that the new dose exceeds the MTD is equal to a prespecified feasibilit y bound α=0.25.  The 
connection between CRM and EWOC is that CRM typi[INVESTIGATOR_764481] (mean or median) 
of the MTD’s posterior distribut ion as the next recommended dose, whereas EWOC uses the 
25th percentile.  Therefore, EWOC is a more conservat ive method than the original CRM 
method.
I7O-MC-JOBA(a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 101 
LY3076226 Toxicity-Band Design 
Neuenschwander et al. (2008) extended the concept of EWOC (Babb et al. 1998) and proposed 
cons
idering the uncertainty of the posterior distributions and using interval estimates to make the 
dose recommendation, herein referred to as the toxicity-band design. 
The Model 
A 2-parameter logistic model is used to model the relationship between dose and probability of a 
DLT: 
logit/g4668/g1868/g4666/g1856/g4667/g4669=/g2009+/g2010 log/g3436/g1856
/g1856∗/g3440,				/g2010>0.		/g46661.1/g4667	  
In the
 model, /g1856	 is the true dose and /g1868/g4666/g1856/g4667 is the probability of a DLT at dose /g1856.	 /g1856∗ is the 
refe
rence dose, such that /g2009 is interpreted as the log-odds of a DLT at 		/g1856∗. 
Toxic
ity Band 
The probability of a DLT is categorized to 4 bands: 
• Underdosing:  /g1868 /g4666/g1856/g4667 in (0, 0.20] 
• Targe
ted toxicity:  /g1868/g4666/g1856/g4667 in (0.20, 0.33] 
• Exces
sive toxicity:  /g1868/g4666/g1856/g4667	in (0.33, 0.60] 
• Unacc
eptable toxicity:  /g1868/g4666/g1856/g4667	in (0.60, 1.00] 
Overd
osing is defined as /g1868/g4666/g1856/g4667>0.33 . 
Dose R
ecommendation 
During the escalation, after each cohort of patients, the following will be done: 
1. Calculate the posterior probabilities of 	the 4 toxicity bands for each dose. 
2. Excl
ude the doses such that the posterior probabilities of overdosing are larger than 0.25 
(overdosing control criteria).  The remaining doses are the ones that satisfy the overdose 
control criteria. 
3. Among the remaining doses, the dose with the highest posterior probability in the 
targeted toxicity band will be the model recommendation of the next dose. 
The data will be evaluated on an ongoing basis until the MTD is determined.  Once the MTD has 
been identified, a discussion between the sponsor and investigators may occur in order to treat 
additional patients at intermediate doses below the MTD. 
Dose Range and Reference Dose 
It is assumed that the starting dose level for the toxicity-band method is 1.6 kg/mg.  Based on the 
prec
linical data, the highest dose level that will be explored in this study is 5 mg/kg and the 
reference dose in model (1.1) is chosen as d∗=5	mg/kg . 
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 102
LY3076226The Prior Distribution on Model Parameters 
A quantile-based uninformat ive prior (Neuenschwander et al. 2008) is used to derive a bivariate -
norm alprior on (α, logβ).  Based on preclinical experience of LY3076226, the median 
probabilit y of DLT for the dose levels from 1.6 mg/kgto 5 mg/kg was determined as in Table 1
of this attachm ent. Any intermediate dose l evel within the starting doses to 5 mg/kgcan be 
explored.
Table 1.  Prior Median Probability of DLT at Each Dose Level
Dose (mg/kg) Median Probability of DLT
1.6 0.075
2.4 0.125
3.2 0.175
4 0.225
5 0.35
Abbreviation:  DLT = dose -limiting toxicity.
For each dose, the minimally inform ative unimod alBeta distribut ion (a,b) i s derived as the prior 
distribut ion for the probabilit y of DLT, so that the operating characterist ics of the model are 
robust to the selected prior distribut ion of DLT:
For m edian probabilit y of DLT <0.5, b=1 a nd a(<1) are tuned to match the median.
For m edian probabilit y of DLT >0.5, a=1 and b(<1) are tuned to match the median.
Figure 1 shows the median and the 95% CI of the prior distribut ion of the DLT rate at each dose
level .
Abbreviations:  CI = confidenc e interval; DLT = dose -limiting toxicity.

I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 103
LY3076226A bivariate normal distribut ion was derived on (α, logβ)that stochastically gives the best fit to 
the 2.5%, 50%, and 97.5% quantiles of the prior probabilit y of DLT at each dose.  The 
param eters (α, logβ)have a bivariate normal distribut ion with mean=( -0.69,0.39), 
SD=( 1.95,1.05), and ρ= -0.25.
Simulation Studi es
Simulations were perform ed under different scenarios of possible dose -toxicit y relationships to 
investigate the operational characterist ics of the toxicit y-band versus tradit ional 3+3 design:
3-patient cohorts starting from the lowest dose.
Maximum numb
er of patients: 24 for tox icity-band method and 30 for traditional 3+3

Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_764482]-band method:  maximum sample size reached or at least [ADDRESS_1047495] been treated at the recommended next dose level .
Assuming that the starting dose l evel is 1.6 m g/kg, 4 scenarios were considered to represent a 
wide range of possible dose -toxicity relati onships as shown in Figure 2 and Table 2of this 
attachment . DLT rates for the starting dose level are chosen to take into account single -patient 
cohorts before . The true DLT rate of the MTD is set at 20% to 33% across scenarios.  Scenarios 
[ADDRESS_1047496] MTD at 5 mg/kg , and Scenari os3 and [ADDRESS_1047497] MTD at 4 mg/kg. When the dose -
toxicity curve is steep around MTD, the concern is the risk of overdosi ng; when the dose -toxicity 
curve is flat around MT D, the concern is underdosing. The simulat ion studi es will access the 
perform ance of the toxi city-band method and compare it to the tradit ional 3+3 focusing on these 
concerns.

With the toxi city-band m ethod, the next recommended dose level is 5mg/kgafter the 1 5th
patient is treated (Figure 3 a), although 2 DLTs are observed at 4 mg/kg,and 4mg/kgwill be 
declared as MTD after 21 pati ents are treated .However, using the tradit ional 3+[ADDRESS_1047500] already been seen at 
the current dose level .The toxicit y-band method has also allocated more patients at the MTD

Scenario 3has a true MTD at 4 mg/kg wi th a DLT rate of 0.[ADDRESS_1047501] ill 4mg/kg after the 18th
patient is treated (Figure 3b), although 1 DLT i sobserved at 4mg/kg. As [ADDRESS_1047502] already 
been treated at the next recommended d ose level, the do se escalat ion is ceased and 4 mg/kg will 
be declared as MTD. However, using the tradit ional 3+3 m ethod, the l ower do se, 3.2 mg/kg, 
will be selected as MTD. Therefore, the selected MTD from thetoxicity-band method is closer 
to the true M TD comparing to the traditional 3+3 method.
Abbreviation:  MTD = maximum tolerated dose.

LY3076226Summary
As a conclusio n, based on the simulat ion studi es on a variet y of scenari os and the illustrative 
examples, the toxi city-band method is slight ly more aggressive than the tradit ional 3+[ADDRESS_1047503] ion rate, with a well -
controlled overdosing rate at a prespecified criterion. Therefore, the modified 3+3 method that 
incorporates the principles of the toxicity-band method will be used in this study  rather than the 
traditional 3+ 3 escalat ion paradigm.

ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other 
causes that could reasonably  explain the elevation. In addit ion, wording was 
added to Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section 6.3.1 to indicate that significant related 
toxicity resul tingin a >14 -day delay  in starting Cycle 2 would be considered a 
DLT.
As requested by  [CONTACT_1622], infusio n duration informat ion was added to Section 
7.2.1 .
As requested by  [CONTACT_1622], cl arificat ion that premedicat ion is not permitted for the

LY3076226As requested by  [CONTACT_1622], Secti on 8.1.[ADDRESS_1047511] a concurrent elevat ion of ALT >3 ×ULN and total bilirubin >2 
×ULN and who, following assessm ent by  [CONTACT_17062], have no evidence of 
biliary  obstructi on or other causes that can reasonably  explain the concurrent 
elevation, will be discontinued from the study .  Addi tionally , Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] was 
revised as noted above for consistency wit h Section 8.1.4 .
As requested by  [CONTACT_1622], add itional ophthalmic exam inations as clinically 
indicated at the ophthalmo logist’s discret ionwere added to Section 8.1.4 and 
Attachm ent 1 .
As requested by  [CONTACT_1622], informat ion about FGFR3 alteration ty pes has been 
added in Attachment [ADDRESS_1047512] ion 6.1.1 Inclusio n Cri teria.
As reques ted by  [CONTACT_1622], a section has been added to specifically address the 
RP2D determination, Section 7.2.4 .
As requested by  [CONTACT_1622], wording regarding avoidance ofstrong inducers and 
inhibitors of CYP3A and strong inhibitors of CYP2D6A has been added to 
Secti on 7.5.

Prem edicat ion is not permitted for the init ial dose of LY3076226 for each pati entso that any  
observed toxicit ies may be appropriately characterized.
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dose -Limiting Toxicity Determination and Maximum Tolerated Dose Definition
Dose -limiting toxicit y (DLT) is defined as an AE occurring during Cycle [ADDRESS_1047515] 
possibly  related to LY3076226 and fulfills any one of the following criteria using the NCI -
CTCAE v 4.0:
CTCAE Grade ≥3 non -hematol ogical  toxicity.  Excepti ons will  be m ade for the 
following:
oNausea, vo miting, di arrhea, and constipation that can be controlled with treatment

LY30762267.2.2.3. Dose -Escalation Method
For Part A, the proposed starting dose level will be 0.2 mg/kg.  Dose escalat ion will proceed at a 
maximum dose increment of 100%.  An accelerated dose -escalat ion scheme will be used, as 
follows:  init ial cohorts will enro ll at leas t one patient each until a dose level o f 1.6 m g/kg is 
reached, unless a ≥Grade [ADDRESS_1047516] possibly  related to LY3076226 is observed 
requi res requi ring enrolling additional pat ients to be enrolled to a dose level.  After which a 
modified 3+ 3 scheme, wi th incorporation of a Bayesian model -based, toxicit y-band method 
(Neuenschwander et al. 2008), will be fo llowed, wherein at least [ADDRESS_1047517] 6 patien ts.
7.2.4.  Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)
TheRP2D will be determined after the complet ion of Parts B and C.  The RP2D will be agreed 
upon fo llowing discussio n between the invest igators and the Lilly CRP or CRS and will include 
an assessment of safet y, PK, and PD data.  This will not exceed the MTD.
[IP_ADDRESS].  General Dose A djustments and Delays
Before the start of each cycle, the following parameters are required:
oHem atologic:  ANC ≥1.5 × 109/L, platelets ≥100 × 109/L, and hemoglobin 
≥8g/dL.   (In Part C only, patients with mult iple myelo ma are allowed the 
following:  ANC ≥1.0 × 109/L, pl atelets 50 × 10 9/L, and hemoglo bin 8g/dL.)
oNon-hematol ogic:  AEs m ust resolve to CTCAE v 4.0 Grade ≤1 or baseline.  
Except ions will be made for:  alopecia, fatigue, or other toxicit ies that can be 
controlled with standard treatment; these toxicit ies must resolve to Grade ≤2.
If subsequent cy cles are delayed by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_1047518] 
possibly  related to LY3076226 , the patient should b e rem oved f rom study  drug treatm ent 
and should co mplete subsequent follow -up.
I7O-MC-JOBA (a) Phase 1 Oncology Protocol Page 115
LY30762267.5.  Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazo le, 
clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, rit onavir, saquinavir, telithro mycin, 
and voriconazo le) with LY3076226 should be avo ided due to the potential for an increase in 
DM4 exposure and toxicit y. Where possible, consider an alternate medicat ion with no or 
minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4. Conc omitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (for 
example, avasimibe [not commercially available], carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenyto in, rifampin, and St. 
John’s wort) with LY3076226 should be avo ided due to the potential for a decrease in DM4 
exposure and potentially effica cy. Where possible, consider an alternate medicat ion with no or 
minimal potential to induce CYP3A4. Concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (for 
example, bupropi [INVESTIGATOR_2394], fluoxet ine, paroxetine, and quinidine) with LY3076226 shoul d be avo ided 
due to the po tential for an increase in DM4 exposure and toxicit y. Where possible, consider an 
alternate medicat ion with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP2D6. Refer to the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) website for a complete list 
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/D evelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteracti
onsLabeling/ucm093664.htm).
Prem edicat ion is not permitted for the init ial dose of LY3076226 for each patient .  Appropriate 
treatm ent wi th topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/oral  corti costeroi ds and/or ant ibiotics may be i nstituted at the discret ion of 
the invest igator if skin react ion occurs.
7.6.1.  Evaluable Patients
Any pat ient who i s discont inued fro m the study  before com pleting one cycle o f LY3076226 
treatm ent will may be deemed non -evaluable for assessment of a dose level, unless they  
experience a DLT prior to withdrawal.
Patients who receive LY3076226 on Cy cle 1, Day  1 (C1D1) but discontinue from study 
treatm ent before the end of Cycle 1 will be considered evaluable for the assessment of a dose 
level provided it can be docum ented if the patient experienced a DLT within 21 days of C1D1 .
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Follow -Up Visit
Following the safet y assessments, which mark the end of the fo llow-up visit (Visit 801), the 
patient will be discont inued fro m the study , unless there is an ongoing AE or SAE that is 
possibly  related to study  drug.  In thi s instance, the pati ent shoul d be followed in subsequent 
follow-up visits (Visits 802 through 8XX), until the event is resolved, the event is no longer 
considered to be drug -related, the event beco mes stabl e or returns to baseline, a new treatment is 
initiated for the patient, or the patie nt dies or i s lost to f ollow -up.

LY30762268.1.4.  Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CRP/CRS will monitor safet y data throughout the course of the study .
Representatives from Lilly Glo bal Patient Safet y will specifically  monitor SAEs.  Lilly  will 
review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by [CONTACT_365203].
Ophthalmo logist may  perform addi tional examin ations when visual changes or other ocular 
symptoms occur, at their discret ion as clinically  indicated.
Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory  
test abnorm alities. Potential for biliary obstruction sh ould be assessed. To ensure patient safet y 
and co mply with regul atory  guidance, the invest igator is to consult with the Lilly  CRP/CRS 
regarding collect ion of specific reco mmended clinical informat ion and fo llow -up laboratory  tests 
(seeAttachm ent 3 ).  If a study  patient experiences concurrent elevated ALT ≥>5 3 × ULN and 
elevated total  bilirubin ≥>2 × ULN, clinical and laboratory  monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by  [CONTACT_1275].   If this is determined to be in the absence o f biliary  obstructi on or other causes than 
can reasonably explain the concurrent elevat ion, then the patient should be discont inued from 
LY3076226.
For pati ents entering the study  with ALT ≥3 × ULN, monitoring should be triggered at 
ALT ≥2 × baseline.
8.3.  Efficacy Evaluations
Each pat ient will be assessed by [CONTACT_764530]:
Com puted tom ography  (CT) scan
Magnet ic resonance imaging (MRI)
Forlympho ma patients only, positron emissio n tom ography  (PET)/CT i s permitted if 
appropriate for standard of care (Cheson et al. 20 0714)
Each patient’s full extent of disease will also be assessed with:
Tumor measurement by  [CONTACT_393] 1.1 (Ei senhauer et al. 20 09), internat ional 
uniform  response criteria for mult iple myelo ma (Rajkumar et al. 2011), or 
response criteria for lympho mas (Cheson et al. 20 0714 ).
10.8.  Efficacy
The study  is not desi gned to m ake an efficacy assessment.  However, any  tumor response data
will be tabulated.  Particularly, the antitumor effect will be summarized by [CONTACT_764518] (ORR).  A patient is considered to have a tumor response if they  achieve a confi rmed CR or 
PR according to RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al. 2009) or lympho ma criteria (Cheson et al. 
200714 ); or a confirmed stringent complete response (sCR), CR, very  good parti al response 
(VGPR), or PR according to mult iple myelo ma (IMWG) cri teria (Rajkumar et al . 2011).  The

constructed to determine the level o f preci sion of the tum or response rate.  Time -to-event 
variables will also be tabulated.  For PFS and duratio n of response, the Kaplan -Meier m ethod 
(Kaplan and Meier 1958) will be used to estimate the survival curves, median s,and survival 
rates if applicable.

Comments 28 14 [ADDRESS_1047519] 1.1X Radiological assessments obtained previously 
(≤28 d prior to C1D1) as part of routine clinical 
care may  be used as the baseline assessment.  
Appropriate tumo r assessment criteria should be 
used for patients with multiple myeloma (IMWG 
[Rajkumar et al. 2011; refer to Attachment 5 ]) or 
lymphoma (Cheson et al. 20 0714 ).

tumor tissue biopsy 
(Parts B and C only)X Collected only if patient has met 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.   If the patient had 
prescreening biopsy to assess FGFR3 alteration 
status, a portion of the prescreening biopsy may 
be used for pretreatment biopsy for the study.

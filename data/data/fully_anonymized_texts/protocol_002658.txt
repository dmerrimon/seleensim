The WEB® Intrasaccular Therapy Study  (WEB -IT) 
1 Study Summary  
 
Protocol:  CP13 -001 Rev.3.1 
Study Name:  [CONTACT_830112]® Intrasaccular Therapy Study  (WEB -IT) 
Study Purpose:  To demonstrate  the safety and eff ectiveness  of the WEB  Aneurysm  
Embolization System for the treatment of intracranial wide -neck bifurcation 
aneurysms  
Study Device:  The WEB Aneurysm Embolization System  
Study Design:  Prospective, single -arm, multicenter , international interventional  cohort  
Sample Size  Up to 1 50 treated subjects  
Study 
Population:  Adults (18 -75 years of age) with  intracranial wide -neck  aneurysms located at 
arterial bifurcations (see eligibility criteria)    
Study Duration:  Each subject will participate for at least 5 years.  Total study  duration will be 
approximately 6 years.  
Primary 
Endpoints:  The study’s primary effectiveness endpoint  is the proportion of subjects 
with complete aneurysm occlusion without retreatment, recu rrent 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, without significant parent artery stenosis (>50% 
stenosis) at one year after treatment.  A subject will be considered an 
effectiveness success upon meeting all of the above criteria.  
 
The study’s primary safety endpoint  is the proportion of subjects with death 
of any nonaccidental cause or any major stroke ( defined as an ischemic or 
hemorrhagic  stroke resulting in an increase of 4 points or more on the 
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) within the first [ADDRESS_1151991] 2015                                                                                                       Page 3 of 6                                                        CONFIDENTIAL

 Secondary 
Endpoint:  The study’s secondary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with 
angiographic aneurysmal recurrence defined as aneurysm growth or 
recanalization at one year after treatment.   
Other 
Endpoints:  Secondary analyses include:  
• Technical  success  
•  IA occlusion status at other time points (6 mo, 2, 5 yrs)  
• Change in mRS (for unruptured subjects only)  
• % Aneurysm occlusion 
• Proportion of IAs with each occlusion category at all angiographic 
follow -up time points.  
• Durability of occlusion – defined as “Sam e”, “Better”, “Worse” when 
comparing the [ADDRESS_1151992] not require treatment within 60 days of the index procedure.  
 
Definition: For the purposes of this study a ruptured IA  patient is defined as 
a patient with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), or lumbar puncture (LP) evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage 
attributed to the index aneurysm within the last [ADDRESS_1151993] the following characteristics:  
a. Saccular i n shape  
b. Located in basilar apex (BA), middle cerebral artery (MCA) 
bifurcation, internal carotid artery terminus (ICAt), anterior 
communicating artery complex (ACom)  
c. Dome -to-Neck (DN) ratio ≥1   
d. Diameter of the IA  is appropriate for treatment with the WEB  
Aneurysm Embolization System per device Instructions for Use  
e. Wide -neck IA with neck size ≥ 4mm  or D ome-to-Neck (DN)  < 2 ; 
 
4. Patient  has an IA  that is appropriate for treatment with WEB without 
the use of additional implanted devices;  
5. If the IA previously ruptured, patient  must be neurologically stable 
with Hunt & Hess Score of I or II.  
6. Patient must be able to comply with all aspects of the screening, 
evaluation, treatment, and the postprocedure follow -up schedule.  
Patient must sign and date an IRB/EC -approved written informed 
consent prior to initiation of any study procedures .  
7. Patient must sign and date an IRB/EC -approved written informed 
consent prior to initiation of any study procedures .

 Exclusion 
Criteria  1. Patient has an IA with characteristics unsuitable for endovascular 
treatment;  
2. Microcatheter could not reach patient ’s index aneurysm to allow 
necessary access to treat with study device.  
3. Patient has vessel characteristics, tortuosity or morphology which 
could preclude safe access and support during treatment with 
study device;  
4. Patient has vascular disease or other vascular anomaly so as to preclude the necessary access to the aneur ysm for use of the study 
device.  
5. Patient has clinical, angiographic or CT evidence of vasospasm, 
vasculitis, or intracranial tumor (except small meningioma) or any 
other intracranial vascular malformations on presentation;

7. Patient has any circulatory, neurovascular, cardiovascular , or 
neurologic  conditions  that have resulted in unstable neurological 
symptoms  
8. Patient has mRS ≥ 2 prior to presentation or rupture ( as applicable);  
9. Patient has had  an SAH from a non index  IA or any other intracranial 
hemorrhage within 90 days ; 
10. Patient has physical, neurologic or psychiatric conditions which 
preclude his/her ability to comply with all aspects of the screening, 
evaluation, treatment, and the post procedure follow -up schedule;  
11. Patient’s index IA was previously treated;  
12. Patient is taking  anticoagulants or has a known blood dyscrasia, 
coagulopathy, or hemoglobinopathy;

treated, to any component of the study device, procedural materials, or 
medications commonly used during the procedure;  
15. Patient is concurrently involved in another investigational study or  a 
postmarket study that could affect the safety and effectiveness of IA 
treatment with the study device or with the study’s follow -up 
schedule;  
16. Patient has an acute life-threatening illness other than the neurological 
disease to be treated in this trial;  
17. Patient has a life expectancy of less than 5 years due to other illness or 
condition (in additi on to an intracranial aneurysm).

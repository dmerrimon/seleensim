Study Design:   Study H9X-MC-GBGC (GBGC) is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel-arm, multicenter superiority trial with an open -label extension to investigate the efficacy , safety, PK and 
PD in T2DM pediatric patients receiving dulaglutide compared to placebo , who have inadequate glycemic control ,
despi[INVESTIGATOR_480719] ,with or without metformin and/or basalinsulin.
Two dosesof dulaglutide (0.75 mg/week and 1.5 mg/week) and placebo will be used in t he 26-week double-blind
period of the trial . Following this, d uring the 26 -week open-label extension, patients who received dulaglutide will 
remain on the same dose they received in the double -blind period, while pati ents on placebo during the double -
blind period will receive dulaglutide 0.75 mg/week . After completion of the open -label extension, patients will 
return 4 weeks later for safety follow -up.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusions:   Male and female children and adolescents aged 
10to <18years,who have been diagnosed with T2D M(Global International Diabetes Foundation /International

Treatment period:   26-week double -blind treatment period
Open-label safety extension :  26-week open -label treatment period
Safety follow -up:  [ADDRESS_617764] dose of study drug
Criteria for Evaluation:   
Efficacy:  The primary efficacy measure is change from baseline in HbA1c at 26 weeks for the pooled
dulaglutide doses .
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are the following:
Change in FBGbetween baseline and Week 26 and Week 52
Percentage of patients achieving a target HbA1c <7.0% at Week 26 and Week 52
Change in BMI from baseline to Week 26 and Week 52  
Change in HbA1c measured in the central laboratory from baseline to Week 26 and Week52
Safety:  Secondary safety endpoints include:
Incidence of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_480722] 26 and 52
Incidence of pancreatitis and change from baseline in pancreatic enzymes to Weeks 26 and 52
Incidence of thyroid TEAEs and change from baseline in serum calcitonin to Weeks 26 and 52
Incidence of dulaglutide ADAsand the incidence of allergic , hypersensitivity ,and injection site reactions 
at Weeks 26 and 52
Pharmacokinetic s:Venous blood samples to measure the plasma concentrations of dulaglutide using validated 
bioanalytical assay s.
Pharmacodynamic s:Endpoints may include, but are not necessarily limited to, endpoints for efficacy (HbA1c , 
glucose) and safety  (blood pressure, heart rate).  The relationship between dulaglutide dose and/or concentration 
and safety and efficacy measures and patient or study factors that may influence PK or PD responses will be 
performed using all available patient data.
Health Outcomes :  To compa re the effect of dulaglutide compared to placebo on health status, as measured by [CONTACT_480747] 26 and to assess the following at Week 52in the validated patient-reported outcome 
(PRO)measure, EQ-5D-Y.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page 6
LY2189265Statistical Methods:
Determination of Sample Size :
A sample size of approximately 150 will be enrolled ( 50patients per arm), in order to obtain [ADDRESS_617765] 90% power for demonstrating superiority of the pooled dulaglutide 
0.75 mg and 1.5mg arms compared to placebo (primary objective) ,with a mean difference in change from 
baseline in HbA1c of -0.65% and standard deviation of 1% ,assuming a dropout rate of 20%.  Under the same 
assumptions, each individual dulag lutide arm will have at least 80 % power to demonstrate superiority over 
placebo. The screen failure rate is estimated as 80%. Among the completers, there will be no more than 25% 
ofpatients who, at baseline, weretreated with diet and exercise only and who are metformin naïve.
While the above assumptions are believed to be reasonable estimates , Eli Lillyand Company (Lilly) may consider 
an information -based approach to sample size re -estimation to select a larger sample size of up to approximately
189enrolled ( 63patients per arm), in order to obtain [ADDRESS_617766] 80% 
power for demonstrating superiority of the pooled dulaglutide 0.[ADDRESS_617767] deviation is1.3%.Usingtheseassumptions, each individual dulaglutide arm will have at 
least 69% power to demonstrate superiority over placebo. Lillywill decide on whether to conduct a sample size 
re-estimation after taking into consideration the study enrollment rate after [ADDRESS_617768] been enrolled.  If it is 
performed, the Statistical Analysis Center’s (SAC) recommendation of sample size adjus tment may or may n ot be 
implemented by [CONTACT_11007] .

LY2189265Statistical Methods:
Efficacy Analyses: 
There will be [ADDRESS_617769] -rescue data; the other primary estimand will be a treatment regimen estimand ,which will use 
post-rescue data. The efficacy estimand measure sthe benefit of treatment when taken as di rected, and the 
treatment regimen estimand measures the benefit of treatment as actually taken.  Each estimand will be tested at 
the full significance level of 0.05.
The primary analysis population for the European Medicines Agency ( EMA)will be the intention-to-treat (ITT )
population,excluding those patients treated with diet and exercise only who are metformin naïve.
For theefficacy estimand, t he primary analysis model for HbA1c will be a mixed -model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) with treatment, insulin usage, metformin usage, visit, and 
treatment -by-visit as fixed effects, and baseline HbA1c as a covari ate.
Analyses on other secondary efficacy measures that are continuous will be performed using MMRM on the ITT 
population (without post -rescue data).  For percent agesof patients a chieving the target HbA1c of <7.0% and 
≤6.5%, longitudinal logistic regressi on with repeated measures will be applied.
For thetreatment -regimen estimand, the primary analysis model for primary and key secondary efficacy measures 
that are continuous will be an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with m ultiple imputation for miss ing data 
in the ITT population ( with post-rescue data).  For percent agesof patients a chieving the target HbA1c of <7.0%, 
logistic regression will be applied.   Missing data at the endpoint will be imputed as not achieving the target .
The primary and key secondary  analyses will follow a graphical approach for multiple comparisons to strongly 
controlthe overall Type I error rate in the trial at a 2 -sided α level of 0.05.
Safety Analyses:
Listings and summaries of safety data will be generated.  Summary sta tistics will be provided for TEAEs, serious 
adverse events (SAEs) , and study discontinuation due to adverse events ( AEs)or death during the treatment period.  
Counts and proportions of patients experiencing AEs will be reported for each treatment group, a nd Fisher’s exact
test will be used to compare the treatment groups.  
For continuous laboratory analytes, the change from baseline to endpoint will be analyzed using an analysis of 
variance ( ANOVA)on the rank -transformed data, with treatment as a fixed effect.  Last observation carried 
forward will be used to imput emissing postbaseline values.  For subjective (qu alitative) laboratory analytes, counts 
and percentages of patients with normal and abnormal values will be analyzed using Fisher’s exact test.
Treatment differences in incidence of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_480723]’s exact test.  Treatment 
differences in rates of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_480724] a likelihood -based approach for repeated 
measures with a negative binomial dist ribution.  The model will include treatment, HbA1c strata (<8.0%, ≥8.0%), 
metformin use, insulin use, visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction.
Pharmacokinetic s/Pharmacodynamic s: 
Population PK (PopPK) analyses will be conducted using dosing data and dulaglutide concentrations obtained 
from all patients participating in the main protocol ,as well as the PK addendum via commonly accepted 
pharmacostatistical methods (for example, nonlinear mixed -effects modeling), and covariate screening. The 
relationship between dulaglutide dose and/or concentration and key safety (such as heartrate and blood pressure) 
and efficacy measures (such as fasting blood glucose and HbA1c )will be assessed gra phically or through 
modeling .In addition, if positiv e antibody titers to dulaglutide are observed, the relationship between dulaglutide 
PK and antibody titer will be evaluated .

5.Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)is a disease primarily  diagnosed in adults ,and the ri sk of the 
disease increases with age (CDC 2014 [WWW]). However, t here has been a significant relative 
increase in T2DMin adolescents and childrenin recent y ears, although type 1 diabetesmellitus
(T1DM)remains the most co mmon type of diabetes in y outh (Dabelea et al. 2014). 
In adults and children with T2DM, the pathophysiology of the diseaseis similar and is 
characteriz ed by [CONTACT_480754] t issues and the liver, decreased insulin 
secretion by [CONTACT_480755] β-cells,and increased glucagon secretion by [CONTACT_480755] α-cells (Baggio 
and Drucker 2007 ; D’Adamo and Capri o 2011).  In adolescents, puberty is known to be a time of 
increased insulin resistance ( Caprio and Tamborlane 1994 ).
In the [LOCATION_002] ( US)and the European Union (EU), children and ado lescentsat highest risk 
for T2DMare minorit y or immigrant youths who are pubertal or post-pubertal (i.e., ≥ 10 years of 
age) living in urban environments (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_480725]-Hamiel and Zeitler 2005; Copeland et al. 2011).  
Virtually all children with T2DMare obese or overweight ( SEARCH 2007). In the US, a mong 
youth with T2DM, studies have shown that minority childrenand adolescents with the disease 
(i.e., African Americans, Hispanics, American Indian s,and Asian/Pacific Islanders) have poorer 
glycemic control than non -Hispanic whites, even after adjust ment for all other vari ables (Peti tti 
et al. 2009).  
Unlike adultswith T2DM, children and ado lescents with T2DMhave few approved glucose-
lowering treatm ent options.  Until recently , metformin and insulin were the only agentsapproved
in the US and EU for the treatment of children and adolescents with T2DM(Tamborlane and 
Klingensmit h 2013).  In 2019, liraglutidewas approved for use in ado lescents with T2DMbased 
on the results of the Phase 3 ELLIPSE study  (Tamborlane et al.2019).While therapy wit h 
metformin is effect ive and safe in pediatric pati ents (Jones et al. 2002), once metformin 
monotherapy  is insufficient to achieve glycemi c goals, glycemic control tends to deteriorate 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (Badaru et al. 2014). Therefore, there is an important need for addit ional approved 
agents to treat children and ado lescents with T2DMthatare safe a nd effective in this populat ion.  
Glucagon-like peptide -1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been shown in adults to improve 
several of thecentral pathophysio logical abnormalitiesof T2DM, including gl ucose-dependent 
insulin secr etion, glucagon secreti on, and obesi ty(Drucker and Nauck 2006 ). Inchildrenwith 
T2DM, the short-acting GLP-1 RAexenatide showed reductions in postprandial glucose after a 
single dose (n=13;Malloy et al. 2009),while pediatric T2DMpatients taking the once daily  
GLP-1RAliraglutide showed improvements in hemoglobin A1c(HbA1c)after 5 weeks (n=19; 
Klein et al. 2014 ).  In these small trials, the GLP-1 RAswere well  tolerated, wi th 
pharmacokinet ic (PK) profiles similar to adults.   In the ELLIPSE Phase 3 trial, liraglutide was 
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_617784] to glycemic control in children and ado lescents, with gastrointestinal adverse events 
(AEs) being more commo n in the liraglutide gro up(Tamborlane et al. 2019).  According to 
publicly available tri al information (ClinicalTrials.gov ), enrollment in the Phase 3 trials has been 
lengthy and challenging , probably due to the rel atively small number of pediatric patients with 
T2DMworldwide and the increasing number of trials enro lling pediatric T2DM patients .
Dulaglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 RA.  In 6Phase 3 studies in adults, once weekly dulaglut ide 
(both 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg) was associated with clinically relevant long -term decreases in glucose 
concentration (as measured by [CONTACT_13505]1c) and body  weight, low risk of hypoglycemia, low risk of 
immunogenicit y,and no new safet y observations compared to the approved agents from the 
GLP-1 RA class (Edwards and Minze 2015).
Because of the pathophysiological similari ties between T2D Min adults and youth, it is 
hypothesize dthat dulaglutide will also have efficacy in the pediatric population with asimilar 
safety profile.
The goalsof this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 superiority
clinical trial with an open-label extensio n are to investigate the safety, efficacy,and 
pharmacokinet ics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of 2doses of dulaglutide in a pediatric T2DM
population who have inadequate glycemic control ,despi[INVESTIGATOR_480726] t and exercise ,with or without 
metformin and/or basal insulin.  The double -blindportion of the clinical trial will last for 
26weeksand will test placebo against dulaglut ide 0.75 and 1.5mg/week (both of which are 
approved for the treatment of adults with T2DMin the US and the EU).  This will be followed 
by [CONTACT_941] 26-week open-label portion of the clinical trial where all pat ients will receive either 
dulaglutide 0.75mg/week or 1.5 mg/week, which will be fo llowed by a 30 -day safety follow-up 
period.  
More detailed informat ion about the known and expected benefits and risks of dulaglutide may 
be found in the US prescribing informat ion(USPI) or the Summary o f Product Characterist ics,

7.1.Summary of Study Design
Study H9X-MC-GBGC(GBGC)is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, 
parallel-arm, placebo-controlled superiority trialwith an open-label extensio n.  Approximately
150male and female children and adolescents (ages 10 to <18 years) with T2DMandinadequate
glycemic controlon diet and exercise alo ne or diet and exercise plus metformin and/or basal 
insulin will be enrolled .  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_102]’s background therapy , 
and screening HbA1c.   There will be a limitation on thenumberof patients wi th inadequate 
glycemic control managed by  [CONTACT_480759] 25% of the total number of co mpleters.  
The sponsor may place limitations on the patients enro lled depending on their demographic s to 
meet regulatory  expectati ons.  
The main study has 4periods:  (1) a screening period last ing upto 4 weeks;(2)a double-blind 
treatment period lasting 26 weeks ;(3)an open-label extensionperiod lasting 26weeks;and (4)a 
30-day safety follow-up period.The end of trial is the date of the last visit or last scheduled 
procedure shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1) for the last patient.
One of the fo llowing measures will be offered to reduce pain associated with venipuncture :  
anesthetic creams, anesthet ic patches, or high pressure anesthetic delivery system immediately  
before venipuncture.
Patients are discouraged from donating blood or blood products during the trial and for 30 day s 
thereafter.

Screening period :  Patients may be rescreened twice for any reason. At the screening visit, 
during which pat ients may be in the non-fastedstate, the parent or legal guardian will sign the 
informed consent form (ICF) and the patient will sign the assent form. If the patient has reached 
the age of majorit y per local country regulations, a separat e assent document maynot be 
required,as the patient is eligible to sign the ICF.The patientswill then undergo assessment s 
related to the inclusion and exclusio n criteria.  
Week -4:  Screening Visit
At this visit, t he following will  be perform ed:  
A complete medical historywill be taken along with f ull date of birth.
Vital signs will  be measured, al ong with height and wei ght, and BMI will be calculated.
The patient’s conco mitant medicat ionswill be docum ented, including diabetes 
medications.  
Blood will be collected and sent to the central laboratory (see the Study  Schedule, 
Attachment 1).
Females of childbearing potential will have d ocumentation of the date of the ir last 
menstrual period and a serum pregnancy test will be performed .  A local urine pregnancy 

H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_617787] may be performedif pregnancy is suspected ( see the Study Schedule, Attachment 1). 
If either test is positive, the patient will beexcluded from the trial.
Females of childbearing potential will undergo questi oning about the use of effect ive 
contraception (seeAttachment 4).  
For those patients who are not immediately excluded, both the patient and parentor legal 
guardian maybe trained on how to use the dulaglutide single-dose pen (SDP) using the 
demonstration pen, which has no needle and contains no medicat ion.  
The patient and parent or legal guardian will be given an appoint ment to return to the clinic 
within 4weeks(±7 days), in the fastedstate, for the randomization visit , assuming the patient 
meets all inclusio n and no exclusio n criteriaat that time .
Double-blind treatment period :  Thistreatment period will last for 26 weeks.  With the 
exception of a telephone visit scheduled 1 week after randomizat ion, study visits will occur 
approximately  monthly:face-to-face visits in the clinic will occur at 1 month (Week 4) , 
3months (Week 13) ,and 6 months (Week 26) and telephone visits will occur in between the 
face-to-face visits(Weeks 9, 18 ,and22).  Any phone visit may be converted to a face -to-face 
visit if deemed medically necessary  by [CONTACT_3462].  Opti onal visits may occur between 
regularly scheduled visits if deemed medically necessary.  If a patient misses a face -to-face visit, 
every effort must be made to reschedule the visit as soon as possible. If a patient misses a phone 
visit, the visit should be rescheduled as soon as possible.  If the patient misses several visit s, 
every effort mustbe made to get the patient to return to the c linic,even if it is only for the last 
visit.  A parent or legal guardian should acco mpany the patient to each clinic visit —whether the 
parent/legal guardian must be present at each phone visit should be determined by [CONTACT_31588]/legal guardian and study  personnel. 
At the randomization visit(Week 0), for those patients taking background di abetes medication, 
the metformin and basal insulin dose swill be established.  Generally , background diabetes 
medication should not be increased more than 15% during the double-blind period, though it 
may be decreased at any  time if the patient experiences hypoglycemia (see Section 9.8; for the 
definition of hypoglycemia, see Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS].1 ).  
During the entire trial, patients should perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in the 
fasted state and at 1other time each day , as well as at any  time they have symptom s suggestive 
of hypoglycemia . For each hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], patients should record their bloodglucose
level (if available), associated symptoms, and treatment in the study  diaries provi ded.  For thi s 
study, a hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_480728] a pat ient feels that 
(s)he is experiencing a sign or symptom associated wit h hypoglycemia OR has a blood glucose
level <70mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L), even if asymptomat ic.  The time and date of all SMBG readings 
must be recorded in the study diariesas well as the date and time of weekly study drug 
administration .  
If pregnancy is suspected at any  time in females of childbearing potential, a local urine 
pregnancy test will be perform ed and a serum pregnancy test will be sent to the central 
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_617788] be permanent ly discont inued from study drug and 
the study. 
Week 0: Randomization
At this visit, the patient will return to the clinic in the fasted state.  The following will be 
performed:
All inclusion and exclusion criteria must be reviewed to ensure that the patient 
qualifies f or the trial.  
A physical examinat ion by a physician will be performed which includes Tanner 
staging.  
Vital signs will  be measured, al ong with height,weight,and waist circumference, and 
BMI will be calculated . 
Blood and urine will be collected for baseline laboratory  tests and sent to the central 
laboratory .  
oA local urine pregnancy  test must be performed for all females of childbearing 
potentialprior to randomizat ion.  If positive, the patient will not be
randomized.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) wi ll be performed.
Concomitant medicat ions will be documented .
The baseline background diabetes medication dose (for those patients taking 
metformin and/or basal insulin) will be established.  Generally , once this dose is 
established, it should not be increa sed more than 15% during the double -blind period, 
although it may be decreased at any  time if the patient experiences hypoglycemia (see 
Section 9.8).  
Females of childbearing potential will have documentation of t he date of the ir last 
menstrual period and will be quest ioned about the use of effect ive contraception (see 
Attachment 4). 
The patient will co mplete the EQ-5D-Yhealth outcomes quest ionnaires. 
The patient will receive :
oStudy diaries for the recording of glycemic and other information and 
instructions on how t o fill them out.  
oAglucometer and supplies ,as well as any training needed to use the 
glucometer.
oDiet and exercise instruction for their T2DM. 
oTraining for the patient and parent or legal guardian on how to use the SDP 
using the demonstration pen.
oA supply of study drug (after the invest igator uses the Interactive Web -
Response Sy stem [IWRS]to get the study  drug assignment) .
At the concl usion of this visit, the patient ,caregiver,or study personnel (whichever i s deemed 
most appropri ate by [CONTACT_3462]) will inject the patient with the first dose of study drug, 
noting the time and date of inject ion in the study diary .  This day now becom es the pati ent’s day

7.2.Discussion of Design and Control
This is asuperiority study, themain objective of which is to compare the effects of dulaglut ide 
0.75and dulaglutide 1.5 mg/week (pooled), added to diet and exercise, with or without 
metformin and/or basal insulin , to those of placebo on glycemic control ( definedas change in 
HbA1c) in pediatric patients with T2D Mover a 26-week period.
The efficacy measure, HbA1c, was chosen as the primary object ive because it is an accepted
endpointin glycemic trials in pediatric patients with T2DM. 
The use of placebo for 26weeks during the double -blind portion of the trial was considered 
appropriate, as no results of Phase 3 trials with dulaglutide (or any other GLP -1 RA) had been 
reported in the pediatric populat ionat the time of protocol development .  Thus,a placebo 
comparator is necessary  to understand dul aglutide’s true safet y and effectiveness .  In order to 
protect the safet y of the patients enrolled in both arms of this trial, the doubl e-blind period i s 
relatively short, there are clear rescue criteria for patients w ith severe,persistent hy perglycemia
(see Section 8.3.4) and patients are allowed to decrease basal insulin or metformin as needed if 
hypoglycemia occurs(for the definit ion of hypoglycemia, see Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS].1 ).
The doses of dulaglut ide for this trial were chosen by  [CONTACT_480761](see Section 9.4).  
The background therapi[INVESTIGATOR_480729], with or without metformin and/orbasal insulin,
are considered appropriate, as these are approved treatments for pediatric patients with T2DMin 
the US, EU,and many countries around the worl d. 
In adults, dulaglutide has been shown to be effect ive in lowering HbA1c wi th consistent safet y in 
the monotherap y setting (diet and exercise only ) and when added to m etformin andother oral 
anti-diabetes agents and/or short-acting or basal insulin.  The decisio n not to maximize the doses 
of metformin and basal insulin was considered appropriate , as metformin at a do se of 
≥1000mg/day is considered a n effective dose in pediatric patients .  For patients using basal 
insulin, up- titration of insulin during the double -blind period would reduce the trial’s abilit y to 
perceive a difference between the placebo and dulaglut ide treatment armsand therefore is not 
allowed (see Section 9.8).  Temporaryincreases in insulin dose are allowed during the tri al and 
appropriate rescue methods exist in the protocol to ensure that patients do not continue in the 
double-blind porti on of the trial with poor glycemic control.   Patients may decrease doses of 
background diabetes medications at any time if hypoglycemia is note d.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_617791] sufficient power for this study.  This is 
due to a number of reasons:  lack of experience with T2DMpediatric patients receiving 
GLP-1RAs;a wide range of baseline HbA1c values ;and the inclusion of patients potentially 
using both met formin and basal insulin in this trial.  These factors will influence the variabilit y 
of the treatm ent difference for the primary  endpoint, which is mean change from baseline in 
HbA1c at [ADDRESS_617792] acebo.

oA patient willbe considered lost to fo llow-up if he/she repeatedly fails to return 
for scheduled visit s and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_17066].  
Site personnel are expected to make diligent , repeated attempts to contact 
[CONTACT_57986] a scheduled visit or who were,otherwise ,
unable to be fo llowed up by  [CONTACT_779].  Site personnel, or an independent 
third party, may attempt to collect the vital status of the pat ient within 
legal and ethical boundaries for all pat ients randomized, including those 
who did not get study drug.
Inadvertent Enrollment
oPatients found to have T1DM, a hemoglobinopathy or other disorder that 
interferes with the accurate determinat ion of the primary  endpoint, or are pregnant 
or breastfeeding at the time of enrollment , willbe discontinued.  
Pregnancy and Breast feeding
oPatients found to be pregnant or breastfeeding during the tri al will be discontinued.  
Patientswho discont inue the study early will have end -of-study procedures perform ed as shown 
in the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 )and will also have a fo llow-up safety visit 30 day s after 
study discontinuation (Visit 801).
8.3.4.Rescue for Hyperglycemia
Patients will be considered for rescue treatment in the fo llowing circumstances:
Weeks 0-6:  average FBG > 15 mmol/L (270 m g/dL) over at least a 2-week period (at 
least 4 val ues/week must be available )
Weeks 7-12:  average FBG >13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/d L) over at least a 2 -week period (at 
least 4 val ues/week must be available )
Weeks 13-26:  average FBG >11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL ) over at l east a 2-week period (at 
least 4values/week must be available)
Weeks 26-52: average FBG >11.1 mmo l/L (200 mg/dL) over at least a 2 -week period (at 
least 4 val ues/week m ust be available)
If the patien t does not meet the above criteria, an investigator may  rescue a pati ent if there is 
other documented evidence that the patient is experiencing severe, persistent hy perglycemia over 
at least 2weeks.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_617800] of approved therapy  for T2DMpediatric patients ( i.e., metformin
and/or insulin s).  The use of GLP -1 RAs and DPP -IVinhibitors for rescue therapy  is not 
allowed.
Patients may be treated wi th short-term (up to 2 weeks) of unlimited metformin or insulin 
therapy with continuation of study  drug (see Section 9.8).  This will not const itute rescue.
During the double -blind period (W eeks 0-26), in patients not previously rescued, rescue will 
have occurred if:
A patient treated with lifest yle + study  drug at baseline receives met formin and/or insulin 
for more than 2 weeks
A patient treated with met formin + study drug at baseline receives treatment with >15% 
more metformin and/or insulin at any dose for more than 2 weeks
A patient treated with basal insulin + study drug at baseline receives treatment with 
>15% more basal insulin and/or another type of insulin at any dose for more than 2 weeks
Duringthe open label period, (W eeks 27-52), in patients not previously rescued, rescue will have 
occurred if there is addi tion of a new medicat ion as described below and not with changes in 
dosing of already administered medication(s) :
A patient treated with li festyle + dulaglut ide at Week 26 receives met formin and/or 
insulin at any dose for more than 2 weeks
A patient treated with met formin + dulaglutide at Week 26 receives treatm ent with 
insulin at any dose for more than 2 weeks
A patient treated with basal insulin + dulaglutide at Week [ADDRESS_617801] (ERB) of the study  sitejudges it necessary  for medical, safety , regulatory, 
or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and good clinical pract ice (GCP).
8.3.6.Discontinuation of the Study
The study  will be discontinued if Lilly or its designeejudges it necessary  for medical, safety, 
regulatory, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and GCP.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page 45
LY2189265Commercial metformin and basal insulin may be made available during the treatment period to 
patients who entered the trial on these agents.  Appropriate use and storage informat ion will be 
available by  [CONTACT_221044]. 
9.3.Method of Assignment to Treatment
After the ICF and assent are signed and dated, a patient is considered “entered” in the study  and 
will be assigned a patient number.  En tered patients who meet all inclusio n criteria and no 
exclusion criteria at screening will be randomized at Vi sit 2 (baseline) .  Patients who are 
randomized to the study treatment are “enro lled.”  Patients will be randomized to 1 of 3
treatment arms (dulagluti de 0.75mg/week, dulaglutide 1.5mg/week,or placebo/week) at Visit 2 
in a 1:1:1ratio according to a computer generated rando m sequence using an IWRS. Patients 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_13505]1c at Visit 1 (screening) (<8 .0%, ≥8.0%), metformin use (“yes” versus 
“no”), and insulin use ( “yes” versus “no”)to mitigate against confounding the effects of the 
treatments with severity of disease or treatm ent with these agents. The number of p atients who 
are treated with lifest yle only and who are met formin naïve will be tracked ,and when the 
number of these patients reaches approximately 25% of t he total planned enro llment, IWRS will 
not allow further randomizat ion of such pat ients.  Site personnel will confirm that they  have 
located the correct carton by [CONTACT_45342] a confirmat ion number found on the carton into the IWRS.  
The second phase o f the study is considered “open -label.” At 26 weeks, all patients on placebo 
will be dispensed 0.75 mg dulaglut ide at that study visit assignment via the IWRS system.  All 
patients previ ously on dul aglutide will cont inue on their previously assigned therapy.  
9.4.Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study
Pharmacokinet icsimulations were conducted to compare the dulaglut ide exposure range in this 
pediatric age group with that of the approved doses in adultpatients. It was found that the 
median exposure of a 10-year-old child with a BMI of 23 kg/m2(approximate weight of 40 kg )is 
close to the 95th percent ile exposure of the 0.[ADDRESS_617802] ion, the patient will remove anSDPfrom the refrigerator, check the 
label to make sure that the right medicat ion is being used, and check the SDPto make sure that i t 
is not damaged, and the medicat ion is clearin color.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_617803] ion may be given in 
the upper arm. 
The patient should uncap the SDP(making sure i t is locked) by [CONTACT_480766].  The pati ent shouldplace the cl ear base flat and firmly against the skin at the 
injection site (and keep it there until the inject ion is complete), unlock by [CONTACT_480767],
and press and hold the injection button ; they will hear a l oud click.   They should continue 
holding the SDPagainst the skin until a second clickis heardin 5-[ADDRESS_617804] t he entire SDPin a sharps container. Patients should 
rotate their injection site each week; they may use the same area of the body , but shoul d choose a 
different inject ion site in that area.
Each weekly  dose of study  drug should be administered on the same day  of the week at 
approximately  the same time of day.  Study drug can be administered at any  time of day, with or 
without food. The date and exact time of study  drug administration should be noted in the study  
diary.  
If a dose i s missed, patients should administer it as soon as possible if there are at least 3 days 
(72 hours) until the next scheduled dose. If fewerthan [ADDRESS_617805] of emergency  codes generated by  a computer drug -labeling system.  This option 
may be used ONLY if the patient’s well -being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatm ent 
assignment.  All calls resulting in an unblind ing event are recorded and reported by  [CONTACT_8784].
If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded during the 
double-blind porti on of the clinical trial , the patient will continue in the study. 
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page 47
LY2189265In case of an emergency , theinvestigator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding 
of a patient’streatment assignment is warranted.  Patientsafety must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determinat ion.  If the invest igator decides that unblinding is
warranted, the investigator should make every effo rt to contact [CONTACT_480768] a patient’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of a 
patient.  If a patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded, Lil ly must be notified immediately.
9.8.Concomitant Therapy
The only allowed conco mitant chronic diabetes therapi [INVESTIGATOR_480730].  
Use of metformin:  
Either metformin immediate release or met formin extended release may be used during 
the studyif indicated for the treatment of children in the local geography ;however, the 
type of metformin should remain the same throughout the study, if possible.  If a change 
in type of metformin (i.e., conversio n of extended release to immediate release o r vice 
versa) is required, the invest igator should determine the most appropriate clinically 
equivalent m etformin dose.
The dose of metformin must remain stable during the double-blind peri odof the trial 
unless:
oThe patient stops tolerat ing metformin.  
oThe patient develops an absolute or relative contraindicat ion to metformin use 
(according to the local metformin label ).
oThe patient experience shypoglycemia (for the protocol  definition of 
hypoglycemia, see Section10.[IP_ADDRESS]).  
During the double -blind period, i n the event of acute illness wit h hyperglycemia, the dose 
of metformin may be increased >15% of the baseline dose for 2 weeks and/or unlimited
insulin therapy  may be used wi th metformin for up to 2weeks.  After that period, the 
metformin dose should be back to the baseline dose and insulin therapy should be 
stopped.  This does not constitute rescue.
Use of basal insulin:
Basal insulin mayinclude:  Neutral Protamine Hagedorn ( NPH)insulin, insulin detemir ,
insulin glargine , or any insulin whose labeling states that it is lo ng-acting and used once 
or twiceaday as basal insulin .
The type of basal  insulin should remain the same throughou t the study, if possible.
During the double -blind phase ( Weeks 0-26), the dose of basal insulin should remain no 
higher than the dose at randomizat ion(Visit 2) +15% .  
oThe dose may be decreased if the patient has experienced hypoglycemia.  In that 
case, the patient’s basal insulin dose will be decreased unt il hypoglycemi a is 
absent.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page 48
LY2189265oIf the patient experiences acute illness with hyperglycemia , unlimited insulin 
therapy may be used for up to 2 weeks.  After that time, the patient’s basal insulin 
dose shouldbe at the baseline dose (+15%) and other insulins(if used) shoul d be 
stopped.  This does not constitute rescue.
In patients on basal insulin, especially  those who are in good glycemic control (HbA1c 
<7.0%), invest igators should pay close attention as to whether hypoglycemia is occurring 
and whether the basal insulin dose needs to be reduced.  
A suggested scheme for adjusting basal insulin in response to hypoglycemia is given 
below.
If patient has 2 FBGs in a week of: Adjust basal insulin dose: 
50 mg/dL (<2.8 mmol/L) Decrease by [CONTACT_2669] 8 units or 10%, whichever is greater
>51-70 mg/dL (>2.8 -3.9 mmol/L) Decrease by 5 units or 5%, whichever is greater
>71-80 mg/dL(>3.9-4.4 mmol/L) Decrease by 5 units
>80 mg/dL (>4.4 mmol/L) No adjustment 
As a reminder, during the double -blind period, if a patientisexperiencing severe ,persistent 
hyperglycemia , the patient should be considered for rescue (Section 8.3.4).  Patients who are 
rescued will continue in the study  and will cont inue to take study drug (unless the invest igator 
determines that they  should not). 
With the exception o f prescription weight loss medications, all non-diabetes concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_480731] a nd can be 
used during the study .  High-dose inhaled or oral steroids should be used only as lo ng as 
medically necessary .  Doses of psychiatric medicatio n should remain stable.
Although effort sshould be made not to change the basal insulin dose more than 15% during the 
double-blind period, during the open-label period (as this period is primarily  assessing safety)if 
basal insulin must be increased, it may be, without calling it “rescue.”   For patients taking basal 
insulin, rescue will be defined as adding another type of insulin.  During the open -label period, 
patients who are rescued will continue in the study and will continue to take study  drug (unl ess 
the investigator determines that they should not). 
9.9.Treatment Compliance
Patient compliance wi th study medication will be assessed.  Compliance will be assessed by
[CONTACT_480769] . 
Patients who are noncompliant shouldbe counseled to increase their compliance , as long as this 
does not jeopardi ze the pati ent’s safet y.  Apatient will be considered nonco mpliant if he or she 
misses doses of study  drug or is judged by [CONTACT_480770].

The quest ionnaire will be administered by [CONTACT_480771].   
EQ-5D-Youth Version
The EQ-5Dis a standardized generic measure of health status developed by [CONTACT_480772].  
The EQ-5D-Yconsists of the EQ -5D-Y descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The descriptive 
system comprises the same 5 dimensio ns as the EQ-5D 3 level (EQ-5D-3L), but using a child-
friendly wording (mobilit y;looking after myself ;doing usual act ivities;having pain or 
discomfort;and feeling worried, sad or unhappy). Each dimensio n has 3 levels: no problems, 
some probl ems, or a lot of problems. The EQ VAS records the respo ndent’s self -rated heal th on 
a vertical, EQ VASwhere the endpoints are labeled, “ The best healt h you can imagine ,”and,
“The worst heal th you can imagine. ”ThisVASinformation can be used as a quant itative

10.3.Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacokinet ics:  For popul ation PK (PopPK) and exposure- response analyses, 6blood 
samples will be co llected fro m all patients(see Attachment 1).
Together with the 3 additional PK samplesto becollected from each patient in the 
PK/PD addendum , these PK samples will provide informat ion for PopPKand exposure -
response modeling purposes, as well as be utilized for the interpretation of 
immunogenicit y data and whetherit has any impact on dul aglutide PK.  Collectively, PK 
sample size and sampling t imes in the main protocol and PK addendum have been 
optimized using a standard PK optimal sampling approach .  
Pharmacodynamics : Additionally, blood for fasting insulin, C -peptide,glucose,and

10.4.Safety Evaluations
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety  of patients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly  or its designee to any  event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient.
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_617806] the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing 
conditions, including clinically  significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in 
the study.
The invest igator will record all relevant AE/SAE informat ion in the CRF.  After the ICF and 
assent are signed, site personnel will record any  change in the condit ion(s) and the occurrence 
and nature of any AEs.  All AEs related to protocol procedures are reported to Lilly or its 
designee.
In addition, all AEs occ urring after the patient receives the first dose of study drugmust be 
reported to Lilly  or its designee via CRF.
Any clinically  significant findings from labs or vital sign measurement sthat result in a diagnosis 
should be reported to Lilly or its designe e.
Investigators must report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential relatedness of 
each AE to protocol procedure or studied disease state, study drug, and/or drug delivery system
via CRF.
The invest igator decides whether he or she inter prets the observed AEs as either related to 
disease, the study  medication, study procedure, or other concomitant treatment or pathologies.  
To assess the relat ionship of the AE to the study drug, the following termino logies are defined:
Related: a direct cause -and-effect relationship between the study  treatment and 
the AE is likely.
Possibly related :  a cause-and-effect relat ionship between the study  treatment 
and the AE has not been demo nstrated at this t ime and is not probable, but is also 
not impossible .
Unrelated: without question, the AE is definitely not associated with the study  
treatment.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page 52
LY2189265As per Lilly’s standard operating procedures ,all “related” and “possibly related” AEs and 
serious adverse events ( SAEs)will be defined as related to thestudy drug.
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to Lilly  or its designee,via CRF,the circumstances and data 
leading to any  such dosage reduction or discont inuation of treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse event collect ion begins after the patient and parent or legal guardian have signed 
informed consent and assent, respectively, and the patient hasreceivedstudy drug.  If a patient 
experiences an SAE after signing informed consent, but prior to receiving study drug, the event 
will NOT be reported as serious unless the invest igator feels the event may have been caused by 
a protocol procedure.
Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has 
worsened during the course of the study .
Study site personnel  must alert Lilly or i ts designee of any SAE within [ADDRESS_617807] igator 
awareness of the event via a Lilly- approved m ethod.  If alerts are issued via telepho ne, they are 
to be immediately fo llowed wit h official notification on study -specific SAE forms.  This 24-hour 
notification requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up SAE 
information.
An SAE is any  AE from this study  that resul ts in 1of the following outcom es:
Death 
Initial or prolonged inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
A life-threatening experience ( i.e., immediate risk of dying)
Persistent or si gnificant disabilit y/incapacity
Congenital ano maly/birth defect
Considered significant by  [CONTACT_480773] .
Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_409232], based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the pa tient and m ay require medical or surgi cal 
intervention to prevent 1of the outcom es listed in this definit ion.
When a condit ion related to the drug delivery system (i.e., the SDP)necessitates medical or 
surgical interventi on to precl ude either permanent impairment of a body  function or permanent 
damage to a body  structure, the serious outcom e of “required intervention” will be assigned.
Serious adverse events occurring up to and including the patient’s last study  visitwill be 
collected, regardless of the invest igator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of causat ion, in the clinical data collection 
database and the pharmacovigilance system at the sponsor.
The invest igator does not need to actively mo nitor patientsfor AEsonce the trial has ended, 
unless provided otherwise in the protocol .  However, i f an investigator becomes aware of SAEs
occurring to a patient after the patient’s part icipation in the trial has ended , the invest igator

Information on SAEsexpected in the study  population independent of drug exposure and that
will be assessed by  [CONTACT_480774]’s Brochure(IB).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as re lated to study drug or procedure.  [LOCATION_002] 
21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated 
detailed guidances or national regulatory  requirements in parti cipating countries require the 
reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs .  Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowedfor the recording and expedited 
reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with glo bal regulations and the associated detailed 
guidances.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events of Interest
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Hypoglycemia
Patients and their parents or legal guardians will be trained about signs and symptoms of 
hypoglycemia, how to treat hy poglycemia, and how to collect appropriate informat ion in the 
study diary according to the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
Hypoglycemia will be classified as follows (the plasma glucose [PG] values in this sect ion refer 
to values determined by a laboratory  or Internati onal Federation of Clinical Chemistry and 
Laboratory  Medicine plasma -equivalent gl ucose meters and strips) ( ADA2005, 2020):
Documented symptom atic hypoglycemia is defined as any t ime a patient feels that he/she 
is experiencing symptoms and/or signs associated with hypoglycemia, and has a PG level 
of <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L).
Asymptomat ic hypoglycemia is defined as an event not accompanied by t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_81066] a measured PG of <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L).
Probable symptomat ic hypoglycemia is defined as an event during which symptoms of 
hypoglycemia are not accompanied by a PG determinat ion (but that was presumably 
caused by  a PG concentrati on of <70 mg/dL [<3.9 mmol/L]).
Severe hypoglycemia is defined as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_266436] o f another person 
to actively  administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative act ions.  These 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] m ay be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma.  
Plasma glucose m easurements may  not be available during such an event, but 
neurological recovery  attributable to the restoration of PG to normal is considered 
sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low PG concentration.
Nocturnal  hypoglycemia is defined as any  hypoglycemic event that occurs between 
bedtime and waking.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page 54
LY2189265Cases of relat ive hypoglycemi a, defined as symptomat ic events during which the person reports 
any of the ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_82344] s of hypoglycemia and interprets those as indicative of hypoglycemia, 
but with a measured PG concentration of ≥70 mg/dL (≥3.9 mmol/L), will also be co llected.
Certain categori es of hypoglycemia willalso be eval uated using a PG cutoff <54 mg/dL 
(<3.0mmol/L)(International Hypoglycaemia Study Group 2017).
If a hypoglycemic event meets the criteria of severe, it needs to be recorded as serious on the AE 
CRFand reported to Lilly as an SAE .
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Pancreatitis
Acute pancreat itis is an acute inflammatory  process of the pancreas that may  also involve 
peripancreatic tissues and/or remote organ sy stems (Banks and Freeman 2006). The diagnosis of 
acute pancreatit is requires 2 of the following 3 features:
1.Abdominal pain, characterist ic of acute pancreat itis (generally located in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_480732] [Banks and Freeman 2006; 
Koizumi et al. 2006]; the pain is often associated with naus ea and vomit ing)
2.Serum amylase (total and/or pancreat ic) and/or lipase ≥3×ULN  
3.Characteristic findings of acute pancreat itis on imaging, such as contrast -enhanced 
computed tom ography (CT) scan ,or less comm only, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ,
or transabdominal ultrasound.
If acute pancreat itis is suspected, appropriate laboratory  tests (including levels of amylase [total 
and pancreat ic] and lipase) should be obtained via the central laboratory (and locally, if needed).  
Imaging studies, such as abdominal CT scan with ( or without)contrast, MRI, or ultrasound 
(transabdo minalor endoscopi c), should be performed as appropriate. If evaluation supports the 
diagnosis of acute pancreat itis, the patient must permanently discontinue therapy  with study 
drug.The most appropriate diabetes therapeutic regimen will be decided on by [CONTACT_3170], 
based on the patient’s clinical status. A review of the pat ient’s concomitant medications should 
be conducted to assess any potential causal relat ionship with pancreatit is. 
Each AE of pancreat itis must be reported. If typi[INVESTIGATOR_10926]/or symptoms of pancreatit is are 
present and confirmed by l aboratory  values (lipase or amylase) and imaging studies, the event 
must be reported as an SAE. For a potential case that does not meet all o f these criteria, it is up 
to the invest igator to determine the seriousness of the case (AE or SAE) and the relate dness of 
the event to study  drug.
In addition to the diagnostic assessment in patients who develop symptoms o f acute pancreatit is, 
each patient will have measurements of amylase (total and pancreatic) and lipase during the trial 
to assess any potential eff ects of dul aglutide on the exocrine pancreas (refer to the Study 
Schedule, Attachment 1 ). Further diagnostic assessment per theLilly algorithm fo r the 
assessment of asymptomat ic elevated pancreatic enzymes will be required whenever lipase 
and/or amylase (pancreatic and/or total) are ≥3×ULN at any  time during the study . 
All AEs of acute or chronic pancreat itis, as well as cases of lipase or amylase values that are 
confirmed ≥3×ULN, will be adj udicated by  a group of physicians external to Lilly.In addition, 
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page 55

Individuals with a known personal or family  history of MEN 2A or 2B, thy roid C-cell 
hyperplasia ,medullary thyro id carcino ma,or a serum calcitonin ≥20 pg/mL at screening will be 
excluded fro mthe study (see Secti on 8.2). The assessment of thyroid safet y during the tri al will 
includereporting of thy roid TEAEs and measurements of serum calcitoninaccording to the 
Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ) at screening, baseline, and periodically throughout the study .
The purpose of serum calcitonin measurements i s to assess the potential of dulaglut ide versus 
other background medic ations to affect thy roid C-cell funct ion, which may  indicate devel opment 
of C-cellhyperplasia and neoplasms.   
Patients who develop serum calcitonin increases ≥50% of the baseline value AND an abso lute 
value ≥20 pg/mL and <35 pg/mL at Visit 9 (Week 26)orVisit 16(Week 52) will be asked to
repeat the measurement within 1 mo nth.If this repeat value is increasing ( ≥10% increase), the
patient will be recommended to undergo addit ional endocrine assessment and longerterm
follow-up by [CONTACT_480776] a serio us adverse effect on the gland. Patients with 
an increase in serum calcitonin ≥50% of the baseline value AND an absolute value ≥35 pg/mL at 
Visit 9 (Week 26)or Visit 16 (Week 52) will be recommended to immediately undergo 
additional endocrine assessments and lo nger term  follow-up by [CONTACT_480777].
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Allergic/Hypersensitivity Reactions and Injection Site Reactions
All allergic or hy persensitivity reactions or injection sitereactions will be reported by  [CONTACT_480778], i fany serious criterion is met, as SAEs. Additional data, such as 
type of react ion and treatment received, will be collected on any AEs or SAEs that the 
investigator deems related to study  drugvia a CRF created for this purpose. Study drug shoul d 
be temporarily discontinued in any individual suspected of having a severe or serious allergic 
reaction to study  drug(Section 8.3.2)or severe injection site react ion. Study drug may be 
restarted when/if it is safe to do so, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of theinvestigator.If study drug is 
permanently discont inued, the patient will continue inthetrial (Section 8.3.2).
[IP_ADDRESS].5. Nausea and Vomiting 
Nausea and vo miting are amongthe most comm on gastrointestinal AEsassociated with 
dulaglutide administration in adult s.  
In patients participating in placebo-controlled trials, gastrointestinal adverse react ions occurred 
more frequently among patients receiving dulaglutide than placebo (placebo 21.3%; dulaglut ide 
0.75 mg 31.6%; dul aglutide 1.5 mg 41.0%). More patients receiving dulaglut ide 0.75 mg (1.3 %) 
and dulaglutide 1.5 mg (3.5%) discont inued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse react ions 
than patients receiving placebo (0.2%). Investigators graded the severit y of gastrointestinal 
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page 56
LY2189265adverse reactions occurring on dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg a s “mild” in 58% and 48% of 
cases, respect ively, “moderate” in 35% and 4 2% of cases, respectively, or “severe” in 7% and 
11% of cases, respectively. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms peaks during the first
2weeks after dulaglut ide therapy is begun.
If an event invo lving nausea and vomit ingmeets the criteria of serious, it will be recorded as 
serious on the AE CRF and reported as a nSAE.
[IP_ADDRESS].6. Renal Impairment
In patients treated wi th GLP-[ADDRESS_617809] ion will be monitored in the clinical trial.  Consider ationshould be given to 
temporarily discont inuing study drug in any individual suspected of having significant renal  
impairment . Study drug may be restart ed when/if it is safe to do so, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the 
investigator.  If study  drug is perm anently discont inued, the patient will continue in the trial 
(Section 8.3.2).
10.4.2.Other Safety Measures
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate
After sitting quietly (not speaking and not engaged in any act ivities) for at least 5minutes, s itting 
blood pressure ( BP)and heart rate will be measured at each clinic visit, using the site’s existing 
equipment.If possible, the same arm and the same equi pment should be used to measure BP and 
heart rate at each visit. An appropriately sized cuff (cuff bladder encircling at least 80% of the 
arm) should be used to ensure the accuracy of BP measurements. The arm used for the BP 
measurement should be supported at heart level. If pulse is measured manually, it will be 
assessed for a full minute.  The measurements of BP and heart rate will be taken in order to 
assess pat ient safety during the trial.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Body Weight , Body Mass Index ,Height,and Waist Circumference
Body weight,height,and waist circumference will be measured at prespecified time points (see 
Study Schedule, Attachment 1 ). Each patient’s weight , height, and wai st circumference should 
be measured according to standardized guidelines (Attachment 6). Body mass index will be 
computed from  the patient’s weight and height.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Pubertal Progression
Patients’ pubertal progression will be assessed throughout the trial.  Tanner stag ing will be 
performed at baseline, 26 weeks and 52 weeks : those pati ents who have reached Tanner stage 5 
will not be evaluated again .  Morning hormone levels (estradio l, testosterone in males, LH, 
IGF-1, cortisol,and prolact in)will be performed at baseli ne, 26 weeks ,and 52 weeks.   
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page 57
LY218926510.4.2.4. Electrocardiograms
For each patient, 12 -lead digital ECGswill be co llected according to the Study Schedule 
(Attachment 1)as single ECGs for overread .Patients must be supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044]  [ADDRESS_617810] ion.
Electrocardiograms may be obtained at addit ional times, when deemed clinically necessary.  
Collection of more ECGs than expected at a particular time point is allowed when needed to 
ensure high qualit y records.
Electrocardiograms will be interpreted by  a qualified physician (the investigator or qualified 
designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the 
patientis stillpresent, to determine whether the patientmeets entry  criteria and for immediate 
patientmanagement, should any clinically relevant findings be identified.
After enro llment, if a clinically significant increase in the QT/corrected QT ( QTc)interval from 
baseline, or other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline is present, 
the investigator will assess the patientforsymptoms (for example, p alpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], near syncope, 
syncope) and to determine if the patientcan continue in the study . The invest igator (or qualified 
designee)is responsible for determining if any change in patient management is needed ,and 
must docum ent his/her review of the E CG printed at the time of evaluat ion.
All digital ECGs will be electronically  transmitted to a desi gnated central ECG laboratory .  A 
cardiologist at the central  ECG laboratory  will then conduct a full overread on the ECG 
(including all intervals); a report based on data from this analysis will be issued to the 
investigative site. All data from the overreads will be placed in the Lilly database for analyt ical 
and study  report purposes.
When there are differences in ECG interpretation between the investigator (or qualified 
designee) and the cardio logist at the central  ECG laboratory , the investigator ’s(or qualified 
designee’s) interpretati on will be used for study  entry and immediate patient management . 
Interpretations from the cardio logist at the central ECG laboratory  will be used for data analysis 
and report writ ing purposes.
The invest igator (or qualified designee) must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the 
time of evaluat ion, the final overread ECG report issued by [CONTACT_81131], and any 
alert reports.   
10.4.3.Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CRP(or designee) will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study and will 
periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data within thestudy by [CONTACT_382612].
Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by [CONTACT_17069].  The Lilly CRP
will, as is appropriate, consult with the funct ionally independent Gl obal Patient Safety 
therapeutic area physician or clinical scient ist, and periodically review, in a blinded f ashion:
Trendsin safety data
Laboratory  analytes including ADAs  
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page 58
LY2189265Adverse events including m onitoring of gastrointestinal AEs including pancreat itis,
allergic and hypersensit ivity reactions,hypoglycemia ,and thyroid TEAEs.
If a study  patient experiences elevated ALT or AST ≥3×ULN, elevated total  bilirubin ≥2×ULN, 
ALP ≥2×ULN, or acute hepat itis, clinical and laboratory  monitoring shoul d be initiated by [CONTACT_1275] (seeAttachment 3 ).  Details for hepatic monitoring depend on the severit y and 
persistence of observed laboratory  test abnorm alities.  To ensure pati ent safety and comply with 
regulatory guidance, the invest igator is to consult with the Lilly CRP or designee regarding 
collection of specific reco mmended clinical information and fo llow-up laboratory  tests. As 
described in Section 8.3.2, study drug may be discontinued if a patient meets 1of several 
conditions.  
In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by [CONTACT_129219], only members of the data monitoring board (an advisory  group for thi s study 
formed to protect the integrity  of data; refer to Section12.2.11) can conduct addit ional analyses 
of the safety data.
10.4.4.Complaint Handling
Lillycollects product complaints on IPs and drug delivery  systems used in clinical studies in 
order to ensure the safet y of study participants, monitor quality, and to facili tate process and 
product improvements.
Patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_81129] a 
complaint or probl em with the IPor drug delivery system (SDP) so that the situation can be 
assessed.
Complaints related to unblinded concomitant drugs (basal insulin and metformin)are reported 
directly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package insert.
For blinded studies like this, all product com plaints associated with material packaged, labeled, 
and released by [CONTACT_480779].
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects of t he 
product complaint process in accordance wit h the instructions provided for this study :
Providing a complete descri ption of the product complaint and any associated AEs using 
the study-specific co mplaint forms provided for this purpose

LY218926510.5.1.Samples for Study Qualification and Healt h Monitoring
Bloodand urine samples will be collected to determine whether patients meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, to determine efficacy  endpoints ,and to monitor patient safety and 
health.
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory  safety reportby [CONTACT_480780] .
Laboratory  results that coul d unblind the study  (i.e., drug levels and anti -drug antibodies) will 
not be reported to invest igative sites or other blinded personnel until the study has been 
unblinded.   Sites will also not receive hormone levels (prolactin, cortiso l, IGF-1, LH, estradio l 
and testosterone )as they are not requi red for patient care.  Si tes will receive all other laboratory  
tests.
Unless otherwise stated in the subsect ions below, all samples co llected for specified laboratory 
tests will be destroy ed within [ADDRESS_617812] results .  When scient ific 
circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain samples to batch the tests run, or to 
retain the sample s until the end of the study  to confirm that the resul ts are valid.   Certain samples 
may be retained for a longer period, if necessary , to comply with applicable laws, regulat ions, or 
laboratory  certificati on standards.
10.5.2.Samples for Immunogenicity Research 
The samples fro m patients in both treatment groupswill be tested for the development of 
dulaglutide ADAs.  A bl ood sample will be collected at specific study  visits at the sam e time or 
within 30 minutes of each PK sample according to the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1).
Positive(or treatm ent-emergent)dulaglutide ADA samples will be evaluated for their abilit y to 
neutralize the activit y of assigned t reatment (dulaglut ide neutralizing ant ibodies).  Positive
dulaglutide ADA samples may  also be tested for cross -reactivity with native GLP-1, and if 
positive, for neutralizing antibodies against native GLP -1.
If a patient develops a posit ive antibody titer, appropri ate medical  management will be utilized at 
the discretion of Lilly and the investigator, if deemed necessary.
Samples will be retained for a m aximum of [ADDRESS_617813] patient visit for the s tudy, or 
for a shorter peri od if regulat ions and ERBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y selected by  
[CONTACT_81278].The durati on allows Lilly to respond to regulatory  requests related to the 
study drug.
10.5.3.Samples for Drug Concentration Measur ements 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamic s
At the visits and times specified in the Study Schedule, venous blood samplesof approximately 
2mL eachwill be collected to determine the plasma concentrations of dulaglutide.  Six blood 
samples will be co llected from each patient according to the Study  Schedule (Attachment1), in 
order to determine plasma concentration of dulaglutide in dulaglut ide-treated pati ents. The date 
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_617814] ions (especially the most recentinjection administered prior to 
collecting the sample )must be recorded on the eCRF fro m the study diary. The date and time 
that each sample was drawn must be recorded on the laboratory accessio n page.
Drug concentration informat ion that would unblind the study  will not be reported to invest igative 
sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details of early access to PK/PD data. 
Bioanalytical samples collected to m easure study drugconcentration and metabolism and/or 
proteinbinding will be retained for a maximum o f [ADDRESS_617815] tothe efficacy and safet y assessments in individuals and populat ions with 
T2DM.

collection.
Conduct a quality review of the database .
In addition, Lilly or it s representatives willperiodically check a sample of the patient data 
recorded against source documents at the study  site.  The study  may be audited by [CONTACT_47551] i ts 
representatives, and/or regulatory  agencies at any  time.  Invest igators will be given noti ce before 
an audit occurs.
To ensure the safet y of participants in the study , and to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable 
data, the invest igator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and patient medical 
records in the patient files as o riginal source documents for the study .  If requested , the 
investigator will provi de Lilly, applicable regul atory agencies, and applicable ERBs with direct 
access to original source documents.
11.1.Data Capture S ystem
An electronic data capture sy stem will be used in this study . Case report form data will be 
encoded and stored in a clinical study  database. The site maintains a separate source for the data 
entered by [CONTACT_480781] -provided electronic data capture system. Data managed by a 
central vendor, such as laboratory  test data, will be stored electronically in the central vendor’s 
database system.  Data will subsequent ly be transferred from the central vendor to the Lilly 
generic labs system.  Any da ta for which the eCRF (including electronic capture of blood 
glucose, electronic or paper documentation provided by  [CONTACT_102]) will serve as the source 
document and will be identified and documentedby [CONTACT_480782]’s study  file. Paper

LY218926512.Sample Size and Statistical Methods
12.1.Determination of Sample Size
Asample size o fapproximately 150 patients will be enrolled ( 50patients per arm ), in order to 
obtain [ADDRESS_617816] 90% power for demonstrating superiorit y of the 
pooled dulaglutide 0.75 m g and 1.5 m g arms to placebo (primary objective), with a difference in 
mean change fro m baseline in HbA1c of -0.65% and standard deviation o f 1% assuming a 
dropout rate of 20%.  Under the same assumpt ions, each individual dulaglut ide arm will have at 
least 80% power to demonstrate superiority  over placebo. Among the completers, there will be 
no more than 25% ofpatients who, at baseline, were treated with diet and exercise only and who 
are metformin naïve.
Because of the high degree of uncertaint y regarding the appropriate sample size, the Statistical 
Analysis Center (SAC), may perform a sample size re -estimation after approximately [ADDRESS_617817] been e nrolled. Based on treatment variabilit y only (not treatm ent effect), the SAC 
may advise an increase in sample size up to approximately 189 pat ients enrolled (63 per arm), in 
order to obtain [ADDRESS_617818] 80% power for 
demonstrating superiorit y of the pooled dulaglutide 0.75mg and dulaglutide1.5 mg arms 
compared to placebo with a difference in mean change from baseline in HbA1c of -0.65% and 
standard deviat ion of 1.3% assuming a dropout rate of 20%. Under the same assumpt ions, each 
individual dulaglut ide arm will have at least 69% power to demonstrate superiorit y over placebo.  
Because of the ant icipated difficult ies in enrollment and the necessit y for meeting regulatory  
timelines, Lilly will ultimately decide whether to conduct this sample -size re-estimation after 
taking into considerat ion the study  enrollment rate and other factors.  The SAC will document 
the exact procedure for the c alculation. This calculat ion will not require input from the DMC.  
The SAC will provide a brie f communicat ion to the Lilly Stud y Teamindicating only the 
recommended sample size (up to approximately 189 patients) with at least 80% power based on 
the predefined algorithm. Lillywill then have the abilit y to adopt the recommende d sample size 
or keep it fixed if i t is determined to be too challenging to enroll or there are other feasibilit y 
concerns. No alpha adjust mentis necessary for this analysis, as it does not increase ty pe 1 error 
(Mehta et al. 2001; Pritchett et al. 2011) .
The screen failure rate is est imated as 80%.  Approximately [ADDRESS_617819] imation suggesting that 
approximately  150patients be enrolled . 
12.2.Statistical and Analytical Plans
12.2.1.General Considerations
Statistical analysis o f this study  will be the responsibilit y ofLilly or its designee.  Any change to 
the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it 
changes a principal feature of the protocol.  Any  other change to the data analysis methods 
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_617820] ification for making the c hange, will be described in a
revised Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) or the clinical study report (CSR).  Additional 
exploratory  analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate .
The primary  analysis populati on will be the intention-to-treat (ITT)population, defined as all 
patients randomized who have received at least 1doseof study drug.The primary analyses will 
be perform edin this population for the treatment regimen estimand wit h post-rescuedataand for 
the efficacy  estimand wi thout post-rescue data (Section 12.2.6). Analyses of other efficacy 
measures and hypoglycemia will be evaluated in this populat ionafter censoring the data 
following administration of any rescuemedication.The Safety population will be the ITT 
population, including post -rescue data .  
Unless otherwise noted, all tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha level o f 
0.05, and confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated at 95%, [ADDRESS_617821] dosing of study drug. Baseline 
HbA1c value will be used to define HbA1c strata for analyses. .  
Continuous measures, unless othe rwise noted, will be analyzed with a mixed-model for repeated 
measures(MMRM) analysis using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) with treatment, 
insulin usage, metformin usage, visit, and treatment-by-visit as fixed effects, HbA1c strata 
(<8.0%, ≥8.0%), and baseline as a covariate .An unstructured covariance structure will be used 
to model the within-patient errors. If this modelfails to converge, the following covariance 
structures will be tested in order: 
Toeplitz with heterogeneit y 
Autoregressive with heterogeneit y, by [CONTACT_765], 
Compound symmetry with heterogeneous variances, by  [CONTACT_765], 
Toeplitz,
Autoregressive, 
Compound symmetry  without heterogeneous variances, by  [CONTACT_765]. 
The first covariance structure t hat converges will be used.  If none of the models converge then 
an analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA )using last observat ion carried forward (LOCF ) imputati on 
with similar terms as in the MMRM model (except no terms that include visit) will be used in its 
place.  This applies to the subgroup analyses as well.  This approach to analyzing cont inuous 
data will be referred to as the standard approach in th eSAP.
Summary statistics will include sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum for both the actual and change fr om baseline measurement s.  Least-squares mean and 
standard errors derived fro m the MMRM modeldescribed above will also be displayed for the 
change from baseline measurements.  Treatment comparisons will be displayed showin g the 
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_617822]-squaresmean and the 95% CIs for the treatment differences 
(dulaglutide –placebo), along with p -values for the treatment comparisons.
Unless otherwise specified, f or categori cal measures, summary  statistics will include sa mple 
size, frequency , and percentages.  Fisher’s exact test will be used for treatment comparisons.
For data after Week 26 (Visit 9), the efficacy  and safety data will be summarized by  [CONTACT_480783] (placebo:dulaglut ide 0.75 mg, dulaglutide 0.75 mg:dulaglut ide 0.75mg,and 
dulaglutide 1.5mg:dulaglut ide 1.5 mg) , but no inferences will be made.  
12.2.2.Patient Disposition
All patients who discont inue from the study willbe identified, and the extent of their 
participation in the study will be reported.  If known, a reason for their discont inuation will be 
given.
Frequency counts and percentages of all pat ients entered, randomized/enrolled, completing, 
and/or discont inuing from the study  early will be presented for each of the treatment groups.  
The reasonsfor discontinuation from the study  will be summarized by  [CONTACT_1570].  
The overall percent discontinued comparisons among the treatment groups will be performed 
using Fisher’s exact test.
12.2.3.Patient Cha racteristics
Demographic and baseline characterist ics will be summarized for both treatment arms.  For 
continuous measures, summary statist ics will include sample size, mean, median, maximum, 
minimum, and standard deviat ions.  Means will be analyzed using analysis o f variance 
(ANOVA).  For categorical measures, summary statist ics will include sample size, frequency , 
and percent.  Frequencies will be analyzed using Fisher’s exact test.
12.2.4.Concomitant Therapy
Patients using me tformin and/or basal insulin will be allowed to enter the study and stay on their 
medication as a background therapy .  Stratification will be used to ensure a balance across 
treatment arms of patients using these medicat ions.  These stratificat ion factors will be included 
in all analysis models to further adjust the treatment effect estimates for background usage of 
metformin and/or insulin usage.
Concomitan tmedications, including previous therapy  for diabetes, will be summarized by  
[CONTACT_3148].  Frequencies will be analyzed using Fisher’s exact test.
12.2.5.Treatment Compliance
Treatment compliance will be determined for each study  period. Overall co mpliance will also be 
determined.  The compliance calculat ion will be detailed in the SAP.  The investigator will 
advise the patient that inject ions should be given at approximately the same time o f the day, on 
the same day of the week.  Compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_81136], by [CONTACT_273597],and overall.  Listings will also be produced.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_617823] -rescuedata; the other primary 
estimand, requested by [CONTACT_480784](FDA),will be a treatment 
regimenestimand which will use post-rescue data .The efficacy est imand measures the benefit 
of treatment when taken as directed, and the treatment regimen estimand measures the benefit of 
treatment as actually  taken. Each estimand will be tested at the full significance level o f 0.05.
Analyses will be performed for both the efficacy estimand and the treatment regimen estimand.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Analysis for the Primary Outcome
For the efficacy estimand, t he primary analysis mo del will be an MMRM for HbA1c change 
from baseline to 26 weeks (Visit 9) with treatment, insulin usage, metformin usage, visit, 
treatment-by-visit as fixed effect, and baseline HbA1c as a covariate.   The HbA1c strata [<8.0%, 
≥8.0%]will not be included in this model as they may be confounded wit h baseline HbA1c as a 
covariate.  In addition, the actual HbA1c will be analyzed using the same model for plotting 
purposes. For thetreatment regimen est imand, the primary  analysis m odel will be an ANCOVA 
model with multiple imputati on for missing data. 
The primary  analysis population for the European Medicines Agency ( EMA)will be the ITT 
population excluding those patientstreated with diet and exercise only who are met formin naïve.  
The efficacy est imand is of interest, andpost-rescue data will be censored.  
The primary  analysis populati on for the FDA will be the ITT population regardless of adherence 
to treatment ,use of rescue therapy,or earlytermination from the study .
The primary  analysis populati on for the other regulatory  agencies and disclosures will be the ITT 
population by [CONTACT_478715]- rescue data.
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Multiple Imputation for Missing Data 
For the treatment regimen estimand only,an ANCOVA, with missing endpo ints imputed using 
the copy referenceapproach will be conducted . Thereference is from those patientsin the 
placebo arm  whohad the measurement for the primary  endpoint. The reference response will be
imputed for all missing data within each treatm ent group. The ANCOVA model includes 
baseline HbA1c as a covariate, stratificat ion factors and treatment as fixed effects. 
12.2.7.Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Changes fro m baseline for HbA1c, FBG,and BMIwill be analyzed using MMRM and 
ANCOVA models on the ITT population.  The MMRM and ANCOVA models will include the 
model terms given for the previously  described primary  analysis m odels.
Forpercentage sof patients achieving target HbA1c of <7.0%at26weeks, for theefficacy 
estimand, longitudinal logist ic regressio n with repeated m easurements will be used.  The model 
will include the independent variables treatment, insulin usage, metformin usage, visit, 
treatment-by-visit,andbaseline HbA1c as a covariate . Post-rescue data for this analysis will be 
H9X-MC-GBGC(e) Clinical Protocol Page 66
LY2189265considered missing. For the treatment regimen estimand, thisanalysis will be perform ed on the 
ITT populat ionof HbA1c target achievement ( <7.0% at 26 weeks) via a logist ic regressio n, 
where pat ients who have no endpointdata will be imputed as nothavingachieved the target.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Multiple Imputation for Missing Data
In thetreatment regimen est imand, the ANCOVA model coupled with the copy reference 
approach m entioned in Sect ion 12.2.6.1will be fitted by [CONTACT_480785]1c with 
baseline HbA1c strata, and adding the corresponding baseline measure as a covariate to assess 
the treatment effect on the 26 -week FBG and BMI change from baseline. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Multiplicity
A graphical approach for mult iple comparisons (Bretz et al. 2009; Bretz et al. 2011) will be used 
to strongly control the overall Ty pe I error (2 -sided alpha of 0.05) for testing the null hypothesis 
of no treatment effect with respect to the primary  andkey secondary  endpoints. This graphical 
approach will be conducted separately for the ITT populat ionwith post-rescue data (treatment 
regimen est imand)coupledwith the copy reference approach , the ITT population by [CONTACT_480786]-rescue data (efficacy est imand), and the ITT popul ationby [CONTACT_478715] -rescue 
data(efficacy est imand)and excluding those pati ents treated with diet and exercise only  who are 
metformin naïve . The same scheme will be adopted in each populat ion, and each will be tested 
at the full significance level of 0.05 .
12.2.8.Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Population PK analyses will be conducted using dosing data and dulaglut ide concentrations 
obtained fro m all patients participating in the main protocol ,as well as the PK addendum via
commonlyaccepted pharmacostatistical methods (for example, nonlinear mixed -effects 
modeling),and covariate screening. The relationship between dulaglutidedose and/or 
concentration and key safety (such as heartrate and blood pressure) and efficacy measures (such 
as fasting glucose and HbA1c) will beassessed graphically or through modeling. Endpoints may 
include but are not necessarily limited to those listed above.
In addition, if positive antibody titers to dulaglutideare observed, the relat ionshipbetween 
dulaglutidePK and antibody  titer will be evaluated .
12.2.9.Safety Analyses
The safety analyses will include measurements ofAEs, SAEs, AEsof interest (hypoglycemic
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], pancreatit is, C-cell hyperplasia, and C -cell neoplasms, allergic/hypersensit ivity 
reactions and inject ion site reactions , nausea and vomit ing, renal impairment),rescue for 
hyperglycemia, vital signs ,and laboratory  analytes.  Unless otherwi se specified, the ITT 
population (including post -rescue data ) will be used for analyses of safet y measurements.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Drug Exposure

LY2189265Attachment 4. Definitions of Highly  Effective and Effective 
Contraception
Participants of childbearing age who are sexually  active should be counseled to use either 1 
highly effective method of contraception or 2 effective methods of contraception combined for 
the duration of the trial and for 30 day s after (until Visit 801).  Childbearing potential is usually 
considered from menarche to menopause.  Menarche should be considered if the female 
participant is cl ose to the aver age age for m enarche in her country  or shows si gns of puberty  
beyond Tanner stage 1.  Any  past bleeding or spotting, no matter how litt le, should be considered 
a potential menarche. 
1.Highly effective methods of contraception (use 1 form)
a.Combined oral cont raceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_81061] -pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]
b.NuvaRing®
c.Implantable contraceptives
d.Injectable contraceptives (such as Depo -Provera®)
e.Intrauterine device (such as Mirena®and ParaGard®)
f.Contraceptive patch –ONLY women <198 pounds or 90 kg
g.Total abstinence1
h.Vasectomy  –for men in clinical trials
2.Effective methods of contraception ( use 2forms combined)
a.Male condom wit h spermicide
b.Female condo m with spermicide
c.Diaphragm with spermicide
d.Cervical sponge
e.Cervical cap wit h spermicide
For patients using oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], if vomiting occurs, advise the patient to use a 
supplemental  barrier m ethod of contraception .
Femaleswho have undergone or who have the following will not be considered of childbearing 
potential:
a.Female sterilizat ion
b.Hysterectomy
c.Mullerian agenesis (Mayer -Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndro me [also referred to 
as congenital absence of the uterus and vagina ])
1Total abstinence is defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the stu dy treatments.  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (CTFG 2014).

Use the same method of measuring height and weight throughout the trial.
Measuring Height
Measure height using a validated stadio meter, not a height bar on a beam scale or other informal 
method.
Ask the pati ent to rem ove their footwear and any headgear (light headgear worn for 
religious reasons can remain, but this should be worn by [CONTACT_480795] m easured).
Ask the pati ent to stand on the calibrated height measuring board (stadio meter) or against 
a wall wit h their feet together and their knees straight with their heels against the back 
board or the stadio meter or the wall.
Askthe patient to look straight ahead wi thout tilting their head up.
Ask the pati ent to breathe in and stand tall. M ove the device’s measurement arm gent ly 
down onto the top of the patient’s head. Record the patient’s height in centimeters (cm).
Measuring Weight
Measure weight using a validated scale (i .e., balance beam scale, digital scales, but not a 
bathroom  scale).
Body weight m easurements shoul d be done in a consistent manner using a calibrated 
scale (mechanical  or digital scales are acceptable). All weights for a given pat ient should 
be measured using the same scale, whenever possible, after the patient has empt ied their 
bladder. Patients should be light ly clothed but not wearing shoes while their weight is 
measured.
Ask the pati ent to rem ove their footwear and any headgear (light headgear worn for 
religious reasons can remain, but this should be worn by [CONTACT_480796]).
Make sure the scale is placed on a firm, flat, even surface (not on carpet or o n aslopi[INVESTIGATOR_221032] a rough uneven surface).
Ask the pati ent to step on to the scal e with 1foot on each side of the scale.
Ask the pati ent to stand still wit h their arms by [CONTACT_480797] (kg).

Summary –A Randomized, Double -Blind Study  with an 
Open-Label Extension Comparing the Effect of Once -
Weekly Dulaglutide wi th Placebo in Pediatric Patients 
with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (A WARD-PEDS:  
Assessment of Weekly AdministRation of LY2189265 in 
Diabetes-PEDiatric Study)
Overview
Protocol H9X-MC-GBGC,A Randomized, Double -Blind Study  with an Open-Label Extension 
Comparing the Effect of Once -Weekly Dulaglut ide with Placebo in Pediatric Patients with 
Type2 Diabetes Mellitus (AWARD- PEDS:  Assessment of Weekly AdministRation of 
LY2189265 in Diabetes-PEDiatric Study),has been amended.  The new protocol is indicated by  
[CONTACT_61504] (e) and will be used to conduct the study  in place of any preceding version of 
theprotocol.
The overall changes and rationale for changes made to this protocol  are as follows:
In the Synopsis, updated the estimated last patient visit date and overall durat ion of the 
study based on current enrollment projections ;removed sensit ivity analyses of analysis o f 
covariance (ANCOVA )with last observat ion carried forward ( LOCF),since it was not 
mentioned in the body  of the protocol and not included in current stati stical approaches 
used for other dulaglutide studies;and updated all other content to align wit h changes 
made in the body  of the protocol .
In Section 4, Abbreviations and Definit ions, revised the definit ion of ‘interim analysis ’to 
distinguish it from the primary  lock analysis planned for when all pat ients complete the 
Week 26 visit (primary endpo intvisit).
In Section 4, Abbreviations and Definit ion, revised abbreviation for the EQ-5D-Y as 
meaning “EQ -5D-Youth Version” and revised this abbreviation throughout the protocol 
to align wit h established naming conventions for the EQ -5D instrument ( Brooks et al., 
2020).
In Section 5, Introduction ,and Section 7.2, Discussion of Design and Control , updated 
certain statements that areno longer accurate to align with current inform ation (for 
example, in Section 5, added liraglutide to medicatio ns approved for the treatment of  
adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]).
In Section 6.[ADDRESS_617841] ives:
oFor the secondary  objective of percentage of pat ients achieving hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c)goalat 26weeks,updated the threshold level of HbA1c fro m ≤6.5% to 
<7.0% forconsistencywith current clinical pract iceguidelines for adolescents
with T2DM(Zeitler et al. 2018).  Movedpercentage of patients achieving ≤6.5% 
at 26 weeks to theexploratory  objectives.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e ) Clinical Pro tocol Page [ADDRESS_617842] ives, as this objective was inadvertently  omitted from prior 
versions of the protocol .
In Section 6.[ADDRESS_617843] ives:
oAdded percentage of patients with HbA1c ≤ 6.5% at Week26as an exploratory  
objective.
oUpdated definition of hypoglycemia from plasma glucose (PG)≤70 mg/dL to PG
<70 mg/dLin exploratory objectives assessing composite endpoints to align with 
revisions to hypoglycemia definit ion made in Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_617844] circumference that
was added in GBGC protocol amendment (b) .
oRevised the exploratory  objective regarding the EQ -5D-Y to specify assessment 
of both change in VAS andthe percentage of patients reporting each level o f 
problem on each dimensio n of the EQ -5D-Y.  These changes reflect the 
anticipationthat an EQ-5D-Yindex formula will not be available at the time of 
primary database l ock.
oAdded change in basal insulin dose from baseline to Week 26 and fro m baseline 
to Week 52 to exploratory  objectives to align with the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP)where this was added as an exploratory  measure of interest in Versio n 4.
In Sections 7.1 , Summary o f StudyDesign,and12.1, Determinat ion of Sample Size , 
updated the projected sample size from a minimum o f 150 to approximately 150 based on 
the results of the sample size re -estimation.
In Section 7.1, Summary o f Study Design, updated Figure GBGC.1 to add ‘Primary 
Endpoint’label to Visit 9/Week [ADDRESS_617845] addit ion of the primary database lock at 
Week 26.
In Section 10.1, Efficacy Measures, updated secondary  and exploratory  efficacy 
measures to align with revisio ns to efficacy objectives discussed above .
In Section 10.2, Health Outcome/Qualit y of Life Measure , revised the descript ion of how 
the EQ-5D-Y will be analyzed , deleted content regarding conversio n toa single index 
valuesince an EQ-5D-Y index formula will likelynot be available at the time of primary 
database lock , and deleted outdated statement that an EQ-5D-Y index formula is 
anticipated to be available in 2016.
In Section [IP_ADDRESS].1,Hypoglycemia :
oRevised upper thresho ld of hypoglycemia definit ion fromPG≤70mg/dL 
(≤3.9mmol/L) toPG<70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmo l/L)to align with current 
hypoglycemia definit ions (International Hypoglycaemia Study  Group 2017; 
ADA2020);added updated references and made c orrespond ingupdates 
throughout the protocol .
H9X-MC-GBGC(e ) Clinical Pro tocol Page 88
LY2189265oRevised PG thresho ld in definition of relative hypoglycemia fro m >70 mg/dL 
(>3.9 mmo l/L) to ≥70 mg/dL (≥3.9 mmo l/L)to align with revised definit ion of 
hypoglycemia above .
oChanged statem ent that certain categories of hypoglycemia may be evaluated 
using a PG cutoff <54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmo l/L)from ‘may’to ‘will’to align wit h 
published reco mmendations (Internat ional Hypoglycaemia Study  Group 2017) .
In Section 12.2, Statistical and Analyt ical Plans, changed‘ITT estimand ’to ‘treatment 
regimen est imand’toalign with the SAP where this naming convent ion was changed in 
Version 4.
In Section 12.2.1, General Considerat ions:
oRemoved the sensi tivity analyses forthe PP population and Completers 
populations, since these analyses have little relevance to clinical or regulatory 
decision making.
oUpdated baseline measurement definit ion to align with the SAP where the 
definition was updated in Versio n 4and clarified that the baseline HbA1c value 
will be used to define HbA1c strata for analyses , since baseline HbA1c is more 
relevant to postrandomizat ion changes than the screening value. 
Removed chi-square test from analyses throughout the protocol ;only Fisher’s exact 
testwill be used, which alignswith current stati stical approaches used for other 
dulaglutide studies .
In Section 12.2. 2, Patient Disposit ion, removed summary  of discontinuations by [CONTACT_480798] .
In Section 12.2.6, Pri mary Outcome and Methodology :
oUpdated the primary  analysis m odel for the treatment r egimen estimand fro m 
MMRM to ANCOVA wit h multiple imputation for missing dat ato align wit h 
FDA-recommended analysis.
oRemoved sensi tivity analyses using t ippi[INVESTIGATOR_480738] .
oUpdated the reference groupin the ‘copy reference’approach to ‘patients in the 
placebo arm  who had measurement at primary  endpoint, ’since review of blinded
studydatasuggestthere are too few pat ients receiving rescue medicat ion and/or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_480739].
In Section 12.2.7, Secondary  Efficacy Analyses :
oFor HbA1c target, for the efficacy  estimand, rem oved the interaction term of 
baseline HbA1c by [CONTACT_480799], and for the 
treatment regimen est imand, updated the analysis to a logist ic regressio n with 
missing endpo int data being imputed as not achieving the target to align with 
current statist ical approaches used for other dulaglutide studies .
oAdded efficacy estimand excl uding metformin naïve patients to conduct the 
graphical approach to align with the population for the EMA thatwas added in 
GBGC protocol amendment (b).
H9X-MC-GBGC(e ) Clinical Pro tocol Page 89
LY2189265In Section 12.2.8, Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses, clarified the PK analysis 
to be performed.
In Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.3 ,Thyroid C-Cell Hyperplasia and C -Cell Neoplasms , deleted the 
phrase ‘…as well as a list ing of biopsy  reports’because this informat ion is not being 
collected on an eCRF and will not be av ailable in the reporting database.
In Section 12.2.10, Subgroup Analyses :
oAdded 2-way interaction of treatment -by-<subgroup> and visit-by-<subgroup> to 
the model, to align wi ththe SAP where this was added to reflect the correct model 
in Version 4.
oRemoved ‘Patients with missing HbA1c and those who received rescue 
medication will be categorized as not reaching the HbA1c target of ≤6.5%’from 
the description summary for primary/key secondary  objectives by [CONTACT_56328], 
since more details will be provided in SAP.
Added text to Section 12.2.11 ,Interim Analyses ,to provide for 2 database l ocks:  a 
primary lock when all pat ients have completed the [ADDRESS_617846] completed the trial.
Revised Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS],Initiation of Pharmacokinet ic Analyses,to align with addition 
of a primary 26 -week database lock .

…
Health Outcomes:  To compare the effect of dulaglutide co mpared to placebo on healt h status, as 
measured by [CONTACT_63202] 26 and to assess the fo llowing at Week 52 in the 
validated patient -reported outcome (PRO) measure, EQ-5D-Youth versio n.
Statistical Methods:
Determinat ion of Sample Size :
A minimum sample size of approximately 150 will be enrolled (50 patients per arm), in order to 
obtain [ADDRESS_617849] 90% power for 
demonstrating superiorit y of the pooled dulaglut ide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg arms co mpared to 
placebo (primary  objective), wi th a mean difference in change from baseline in HbA1c of -
H9X-MC-GBGC(e ) Clinical Pro tocol Page 92
LY21892650.65% and standard deviat ion of 1%, assuming a dropout rate of 20%.  Under the same 
assumptions, each individual dulaglut ide arm will have at least 80% power to demonstrate 
superiority over placebo.  The screen failure rate is estimated as 80%.  Among the comple ters, 
there will be no more than 25% of patients who, at baseline, weretreated with diet and exercise 
only and who are m etforminnaïve.
While the above assumpt ions are believed to be reasonable est imates, Eli Lilly and Co mpany 
(Lilly) may consider an info rmation-based approach to sample size re -estimation to select a 
larger sample size of up to approximately 189enrolled ( 63patients per arm ), in order to obtain 
[ADDRESS_617850] 80% power for demonstrating superiorit y of 
the pooled dulaglutide 0.[ADDRESS_617851] 
deviation is1.3%.Using these assumpt ions, each individual dulaglut ide arm will have at least 
69% power to demonstrate superiorit y over placebo.  Lillywill decide on whether to conduct a 
sample size re- estimation after taking into consideration the study  enrollment rate after [ADDRESS_617852] ical Analysis Center’s (SAC) 
recommendat ion of sample size adjust ment may or may not be implemented by  [CONTACT_11007].  If the 
sample size re estimation is not implemented, then the target enrollment will be 150 patients 
(50patients per arm) .
Efficacy Analyses: 
There will be [ADDRESS_617853] -rescue data; the other primary  
estimand will be an intent totreat (ITT) a treatment regimen estimand which will use post -
rescue data. The efficacy est imand measure sthe benefit of treatment when taken as directed, 
and theITTtreatment regimen estimand m easures the benef it of treatment as actually  taken.  
Both estimands will use the same primary  analysis m odel and each Each estimand will be tested 
at the full significance level of 0.05.
The primary  analysis populati on for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) will be the 
intention-to-treat (ITT)population, excluding those patients treated with diet and exercise only 
who are met formin naïve.
For theefficacy estimand, Tthe primary analysis model for HbA1c will be a mixed -model for 
repeated m easures (MMRM) using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) with treatment, 
insulin usage, metformin usage, visit, and treatment -by-visit as fixed effects, and baseline HbA1c 
as a covariate.   An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within patient 
errors.  An analogou s analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA) will be conducted as supportive 
analysis.  Missing endpo ints will be imputed with the last (postbaseline) observat ion carried 
forward (LOCF).   Multiple imputati on for missing data will also be conducted on the primary  
analysis model in the ITT popul ation (with and without postrescue data) as supportive analyses 
to evaluate the situation when data is not missing at random.  The primary analysis model, 
MMRM, will be repeated using the Per Protocol (PP) populat ion to check th e sensitivity of the 
analysis.
H9X-MC-GBGC(e ) Clinical Pro tocol Page 93
LY2189265Analyses on other secondary  efficacy measures that are continuous will be performed using 
MMRM on the ITT population ( with andwithout post-rescue data).  For percentages of patients 
achieving the target HbA1c of <7.0% and ≤6.5%, longi tudinal logistic regressio n with repeated 
measures will be applied.
For thetreatment-regimen est imand, the primary analysis model for primary and key secondary 
efficacy measures that are continuous will be an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) mode l with 
multiple imputation for missing data in the ITT populat ion (with post-rescue data).  For 
percentages of pat ients achieving the target HbA1c of <7.0%, logist ic regressio n will be applied.   
Missing data at the endpo int will be imputed as not achieving the target.
The primary  and key secondary  analyses will fo llow a graphical approach for mult iple 
comparisons to strongly control the overall Ty pe I error rate in the trial at a 2 -sided α level 
of0.05.
Safety Analyses:
Listings and summaries of safet y data will be generated.  Summary statist ics will be provided for 
TEAEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and study  discontinuat ion due to adverse events (AEs) or 
death during the treatment period.  Counts and proportions of patients experiencing AEs will be 
reported for each treatment group, and chisquare or Fisher’s exact test swill be used to com pare 
the treatment groups.
For continuous laboratory  analytes, the change from baseline to endpoint will be analyzed using 
an analysis o f variance (ANOVA) on the r ank-transform ed data, wi th treatment as a fixed effect.  
Last observat ion carried forward will be used to imput emissing postbaseline values.  For 
subjective (qualitat ive) laboratory analytes, counts and percentages of patients with normal and 
abnormal values will be analyzed using chisquare or Fisher’s exact test s.

LY21892655. Introduction
…
Unlike adults with T2DM, c hildren and ado lescents with T2DM have few approved glucose-
lowering treatm ent options.  Until recently, Mmetformin and insulinarewerethe only agents
approved in the US and EU for the treatment of children and adolescents with T2DM 
(Tamborl ane and Klingensmit h 2013).  In 2019, liraglut ide was approved for use in ado lescents 
with T2DM based on the results of the Phase 3 ELLIPSE study  (Tamborlane et al . 2019).While 
therapy with metformin is effective and safe in pediatric patients (Jones et al. 2002), o nce 
metformin monotherapy  is insufficient to achieve glycemi c goals, glycemic control tends to 
deteriorate rapi [INVESTIGATOR_375] (Badaru et al. 2014)and the only available approved next step is exogenous 
insulin therapy . Therefore, there is an important need for addit ional approved agents to treat 
children and ado lescents with T2DMthatare safe a nd effective in this populat ion.
Glucagon-like peptide -1 receptor agonists (GLP- 1 RAs) have been shown in adults to improve 
several of thecentral pathophysio logical abnormalitiesof T2DM, including gl ucose-dependent

T2DM, the short -acting GLP-1 RA exenat ide showed reductions in postprandial glucose after a 
single dose (n=13; Malloy et al. 2009), while pediatric T2DM patients taking the once daily  
GLP-1RA liraglutide showed improvements in hemoglobin A1c(HbA1c) after 5 weeks (n=19; 
Klein et al. 2014).  In these small trials, the GLP -1 RAs were well tolerated, with 
pharmacokinet ic (PK) profiles similar to adults .  In the ELLIPSE Phase [ADDRESS_617854] to glycemic control in children and ado lescents, with gastrointestinal adverse events

approved for adults (ClinicalTrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], respectively).   According 
to publicly available trial informat ion (ClinicalTrials.gov), enrollment in the Phase 3 tr ials has 
been lengthy  and challenging, probably  due to the rel atively small number of pediatric pat ients 
with T2DM worl dwide and the increasing number of trials enrolling pediatric T2DM pat ients.

…
EQ-5D-Youth Version
The EuroQOL Five Dime nsion (EQ-5D)Youth version quest ionnaireis a standardized generic 
measure of health status developed by [CONTACT_480772]. The EQ-5D-Yconsists of 2pages:  
the EQ-5D-Youth version descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale ( VAS).  The 
descriptive system co mprises the same 5 dimensio ns as the EQ -5D 3 level (EQ -5D-3L), but 
using a child -friendly wording (mobilit y; looking after myself; doing usual act ivities; having 
pain or di scomfort; and feeling worried, sad or unhappy ).  Each dim ension has 3 levels:  no 
problems, some probl ems, or a l ot of problems.  The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self -rated 
health on a vertical, EQ VAS where the endpo ints are labeled, “The best health you can 
imagine,” and, “The worst healt h you can imagine. ”  This VAS inform ation can be used as a 
quantitative measure of the percepti on of their overall healthoutcome as judgedby [CONTACT_209484].
EQ5DYouth version health states, defined by [CONTACT_20367] 5D descript ive system, will be converted 
into a single index value by [CONTACT_2931] a formula that essentially attaches value (also called 
weights) to each of the levels in each dimensio n.  The index value is a major feature of the 
EQ5D instrument, facilitat ing the calculat ion of qualit yadjusted life years that are used to 
inform economic evaluat ions of healt hcare intervent ions.  As of 2015, an EQ 5DYouth version 
index form ula is not available, but it is anticipated to be available in 2016.   Please refer to the 
EQ5DYouth version User Guide for appropriat e scoring methodology .  The EQ -5D-Youth 
versionwill be administered at baseline, Week 26, and Week 52 (or early  termination [ET]), as 
per the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).  The Week 26 and Week 52 EQ-5D-Youth versio nis an 
objective in the study .  
Details about scoring the PRO instrument can be found in the EQ-5D-Youth version User Guide

12.2.1. General Considerations
…
The primary  analysis populati on will be the intention-to-treat (ITT)population, defined as all 
patients randomized who have received at least 1doseof study drug.  The primary analyses will 
be perform ed in this population ,for theITTtreatment regimen estimand wit h post-rescue data 
and for the efficacy est imand without post -rescue data (Section 12.2.6).  Analyses of other 
efficacy measures and hypoglycemia will be evaluated in this populat ionafter censoring the data 
following administration of any rescuemedication.  The primary endpo int measure, HbA1c in 
change from baseline to Week 26, and key  secondary  endpoint m easures (FBG, percent to goal
in HbA1c, and BMI) in change fro m baseline to Week 26 will also be evaluated in the Per 
Protocol (PP) populat ion and Completers populat ions.  The PP populat ion will be based on 
patients who were compliant with study  medication, took no concomitant medicat ions that would 
confound the interpretation of results (such as syst emic steroi ds or non study glucoselowering 
agents used >14 days), and have an HbA1c measurement at the primary visit endpo int.  Data 
postrescue will be censored for the PP analyses. TheSafety population will be the ITT 
population, including post -rescue data .  The Completers populat ion will consist of all patients in 
the ITT populat ion who completed Week [ADDRESS_617857] been on study  drug for the ent ire study.
Unless otherwise noted, all tests of treatment e ffects will be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha level o f 
0.05, and confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated at 95%, [ADDRESS_617858] nonmissing measurement taken prior to this visit will be used for the baseline measurement .
…
Unless otherwise specified, f or categori cal measures, summary  statistics will include sample 
size, frequency , and percentages.  Fisher’s exact test will be used for treatment comparisons , 
unless 80% of cells have an expected value of at least 5, in which case the chi square test will 
beused.
12.2.2. Patient Disposition
All patients who discont inue from the study will be identified, and the extent of their 
participation in the study will be reported.  If known, a reason for their discont inuation will 
begiven.

Demographic and baseline characterist ics will be summarized for both treatment arms.  For 
continuous measures, summary statist ics will include sample size, mean, median, maximum, 
minimum, and standard deviat ions.  Means will be analyzed using analysis o f variance 
(ANOVA).  For categorical measures, summary statist ics will include sample size, frequency ,

Concomitan tmedications, including previ ous therapy  for diabetes, will be summarized by  
[CONTACT_3148].  Frequencies will be analyzed using a chisquare or Fisher’s exact test.
12.2.6. Primary Outcome and Methodology
There will be 2primary est imands to compare the placebo and the pooled dulaglutide arms in 
terms of the primary  measure of HbA1c change from baseline to [ADDRESS_617859] -rescuedata; the other primary 
estimand, requested by  [CONTACT_3133] (FDA), will bean ITTa treatment 
regimenestimand(effectiveness/treatment regimen est imand)which will use post-rescue data .
The efficacy est imand measures the benefit of treatment when taken as directed, and the ITT
treatment regimen estimand measures the benefit of treatment as actually taken.  Both estimands 
will use the same primary  analysis m odel, and eEach estimand will be tested at the full 
significance l evel of 0.05 .
Analyses will be perfo rmed for both the efficacy estimand and the ITTtreatment regimen
estimand.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Analysis for the Primary Outcome
For the efficacy estimand, Tthe primary analysis model will be an MMRM for HbA1c change 
from baseline to 26 weeks (Visit 9) with treatment, insulin usage, met formin usage, visit, and
treatment-by-visit as fixed effect, and baseline HbA1c as a covariate.  The HbA1c strata [<8.0%, 
≥8.0%] will not be included in this model as they may be confounded wit h baseline HbA1c as a 
covariate.  In addition, the actual HbA1c will be analyzed using the same model for plotting 
purposes. For the treatment regimen est imand, the primary analysis model w ill be an ANCOVA 
model with multiple imputati on for missing data.

H9X-MC-GBGC(e ) Clinical Pro tocol Page 102
LY218926512.2.6.2. Additional Analyses for the Primary Outcome
The primary  analysis m odel, MMRM, will  be repeated using the PP and Completers populat ions 
to check the sensit ivity of the analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Multiple Imputation for Missing Data
To investigate departure fro m the missing at random (MAR) assumpt ion for the primary analysis 
that excludes post rescue data, sensit ivity analyses using pattern mixture models with a missing 
not at random ( MNAR) assumpt ion will be performed.  For both the efficacy estimand (missing 
data and post rescue data both considered as missing), and the ITT estimand (post rescue data 
not treated as missing), the same MMRM model coupled with a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_480740] r data 
imputation, recommended by [CONTACT_480801], will be performed to evaluate the 
magnitude of the departure fro m MAR assumption. 
For theITT populat iontreatment regimen est imandonly, an ANCOVA, with missing endpoints 
imputed using the copy  reference approach will be conducted.  The reference is fro m those 
patientson the same treatment who received rescue medicat ion and/or stopped study  medication, 
butin the placebo arm who hadthe measurement for the primary  endpoint.  The reference 
response will be imputed for all missing data within each treatment group. The ANCOVA 
model includes baseline HbA1c as a covariate ,andstratificat ion factors and treatm ent as 
fixedeffects.
12.2.7. Secondary Efficacy Analyses
Changes fro m baseline for HbA1c, FBG, and BMI will be analyzed using MMRM and 
ANCOVA models on the ITT and PP and Completers populations.  The MMRM and ANCOVA 
models will include the m odel terms given for the previously descri bed primary  analysis model s.
For percentage sof patients achieving target HbA1c of ≤6.5<7.0% at26weeks, for the efficacy 
estimand, longitudinal logist ic regressio n with repeated m easurements will be used.  The model 
will include the independent variables treatment, insulin usage, metformin usage, visit, 
treatment-by-visit,baseline HbA1c by[CONTACT_765],andbaseline HbA1c as a covariate .  For an efficacy 
estimand, post Post-rescue data for this analysis will be considered missing. As an addit ional 
effectivenessFor the treatment regimen estimand, this analysis will be performed on the ITT 
populationof HbA1c target achievement ( ≤6.5<7.0% at 26 weeks) via a longitudinal logistic 
regression, where patients who have been rescued or have no postbaseline endpoint data will be 
imputed as nothavingachieved the target , while for nonrescued patients the available data will 
be used.

In theITT populationtreatment regimen est imand, the ANCOVA m odel coupled with the copy 
reference approach ment ioned in Sect ion 12.2.6.1will be fitted by [CONTACT_480785]1c

LY218926512.2.7.2. Multiplicity
A graphical approach for mult iple comparisons (Bretz et al. 2009; Bretz et al. 2011) will be used 
to strongly control the overall Ty pe I error (2 -sided alpha of 0.05) for testing the null hypothesis 
of no treatment effect wi th respect to the primary  andkey secondary  endpoints.  Thi s graphical 
approach will be conducted separately for the ITT populat ionwith post-rescue data (treatment 
regimen est imand), ITT popul ationcoupled with the copy reference approach, andthe ITT 
population by [CONTACT_478715]- rescue data (efficacy estimand), and the ITT population by 
[CONTACT_478715] -rescue data (efficacy est imand) and excluding those patients treated with diet 
and exercise only  who are m etformin naïve. The same scheme will be adopted in each 
population, and each will be tested at the full significance level o f 0.05.
12.2.8. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic A nalyses
Population PK analyses will be conducted using dosing data and dulaglut ide concentrations 
obtained fro m all patients participating in the main protocol, as well as the PK addendum via
commonlyaccepted pharmacostatistical methods (for example, nonlinear mixed -effects 
modeling),and covariate screening. The relationship between dulaglutidedoseand/or 
concentration and key safety (such as heartrate and blood pressure) and efficacy measures (such 
as fasting glucose and HbA1c) will beperformedassessed graphically  or through m odeling.

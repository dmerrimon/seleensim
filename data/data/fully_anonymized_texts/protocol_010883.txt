 138 
This study is being conducted by [CONTACT_149354] (PEDIG) and is 139 
funded through a cooperative agreement from the National Eye Institute.  It is one of a series of 140 
randomized trials and observational studies conducted by [CONTACT_869238] 141 
intermittent exotropia (IXT)  in children.  [ADDRESS_1213038] common type of childhood -onset exotropia is IXT,1-4 with a reported incidence of 145 
32.1/100,00 0,1 occurring more frequently in females5 and in Asian children.4, 6, 7 IXT is a term 146 
used to describe several  subgroup s of intermittent exodeviations, namely basic, true divergence 147 
excess, pseudo divergence excess , and convergence insuff iciency  IXT. Many cases  of 148 
exodeviations are characterized by [CONTACT_869239], but 149 
may also be present at near. Normal binocular single vision and normal stereoacuity are  usually  150 
present at near when the exotropia is  controlled , although stereoacuity can be reduced  in about 151 
25% of cases .8, [ADDRESS_1213039] a favorable treatment benefit in two small  retrospective studies,12, 13 its clinical 163 
effectiveness (either using corrective or relieving prism) has not yet been studied prospectively [ADDRESS_1213040] evaluated corrective prism alone as an intervention specifically for IXT:   170 
 171 
Pratt -Johnson and Tillson 197912  172 
Twenty -five children (aged 2 -8 years) with small -angle (<20Δ) IXT were evaluated  173 
retrospectively , 13 of whom had undergone previous surgery but had residual or recurrent IXT. 174 
Spectacles  were prescribed with base -in prism ( typi[INVESTIGATOR_869232] -On prism that was 175 
generally split evenly be tween the eyes ) that fully corrected the maximum angle of deviation. Six 176 
of 25 never obtained their prism spectacles  and 7 of 25 wore them < 50% of the time , and these 177 
patients (total n=13) were used as a pseudo -control group. The other 12 patients wore their prism 178 
spectacles  >50% of awake hours for 12 months to 2.5  years (8 of 12 had undergone previous 179 
surgery). Prism was discontinued for 1 month and outcome s were evaluated.  180 
 181 
The outcome was “cure ,”  defined by [CONTACT_869240] : 1) no 182 
monocular eye closure in sunlight; 2) no manifest tropia at any distance; 3) [ADDRESS_1213041]; 4) divergence amplitudes ≥ 5Δ on the synotophore (major 184

29May2019     1-2 amblyoscope) using a foveal fusion target; 5) recognition of diplopia immediately when the 185 
divergence amplitude was exceeded; 6) good convergence amplitude; and 7) t otal convergence 186 
and divergence amplitude s > 20Δ  in the synotophore (major amblyoscope) or in free space with 187 
prisms .  188 
 189 
Results: Eight of 12 patients  (67%) in the prism group met criteria for cure (2 of 4 with 190 
previously un -operated IXT and 6 of 8 with previously operated IXT). None of the 13 patients in 191 
the pseudo control group met criteria for cure.  However, it is important to recognize t hat this 192 
was not a true control group, and it is unknown if additional clinical factors were present that 193 
limited patient compliance.  194 
 195 
Véronneau -Troutman et al 197613 196 
The authors r etrospectively evaluated 14 patients  (average age of 8.3 years;  range 3 to 26 years) 197 
with IXT (mean angle of deviation 26.4 Δ, range 12 -45Δ) , treated with Fresnel prism s (fully 198 
correcting the average of distance and near horizontal deviation plus any vertic al). Average 199 
duration of treatment was 3.7 months and outcome s were assessed out of prism  (time out of 200 
prism not provided) .  201 
 202 
Results: Control of the IXT  was reported to be improved  (some changed from constant XT to 203 
either IXT or exophoria, some changed fr om IXT to exophoria), the  angle of deviation decreased 204 
on average by 4.6∆ , and mean convergence amplitudes improved by 6.2∆ at distance and 9.3∆ at 205 
near.  206 
 207 
While the prism amounts prescribed in the aforementioned studies were fully “ corrective” (prism 208 
power equaled the exodeviation angle), it was stated that the prism amount was often a mean of [ADDRESS_1213042] to fully corrective prism, Vérnonneau -Troutman subsequently suggested in her 212 
textbook on prisms t hat “the minimum  power necessary to achieve control of the exodeviation at 213 
distance” should be prescribed.16  Others also recommend that the minimum “relievin g” prism 214 
that provides improved sensorimotor fusion (e.g., control, suppression, stereopsis) be 215 
prescribed.14, 15   216 
 217 
1.4 Possible Mechanisms of Prism Therapy  218 
Whether relieving or correcting prism is used, t he mechanism for improvement of IXT with 219 
prism therapy is largely unknown. In t he short term, prism may improve the ability of the child 220 
to control the exodeviation by [CONTACT_869241] 221 
necessary to align the eyes (less convergence is required for bifoveal stimulation with the prism 222 
than without) . In the longer term, prism therapy for IXT may benefit the individual by [CONTACT_30212] [ADDRESS_1213043] normal sensory 225 
fusion and reduced compensating fusional con vergence ability ,14-16 and therefore  the adage that 226 
“sensory fusion is the best orthoptics” forms the basis for this treatment; the anticipation is that 227 
better sensory fusion will encourage the development of better motor control .17  228

29May2019     1-3 1.5 Methods of Prescribing Prism for IXT  230 
There is currently no universally accepted formula or method for determining the optimal prism 231 
treatment for patients with IXT.  The amount of prism prescribed to treat IXT in previous studies 232 
and in clinical pra ctice varies and is based on 3 philosophical approaches:  233 
1.  Corrective prism is prescribed for the full angle of deviatio n. 234 
2. Customized prism: the minimum prism required to comfortably improve fusion (e.g., 235 
better control, change of diplopia or suppression r esponse to a fusion response on testing, 236 
decrease in the frequency of the IXT based on cover -uncover testing ).  This approach 237 
could result in corrective or relieving prism being prescribed, albeit for IXT, the 238 
customized approach usually results in relievi ng prism and rarely in corrective prism.  239 
3. A fixed amount of relieving prism (e.g., always prescribe 5∆ or 10∆) or a prism 240 
magnitude that is a percentage of the maximum exodeviation : The percentage of the [ADDRESS_1213044] is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 33% to 50% of the maximum deviation18 and is usually [ADDRESS_1213045] of sensorimotor fusion (e.g., better cont rol, change of diplopia 262 
or suppression response to a fusion response on testing, decrease the frequency of the IXT based 263 
on cover -uncover testing, increase in stereoacuity) as determined by [CONTACT_869242].  [ADDRESS_1213046] the angle of 273 
deviation in some patients, especially with acquired esotropia, the patient “adapts” to the prism [ADDRESS_1213047], thus effectively making the deviation larger.  The Prism Adaptation Study demonstrated 275 
greater surgical succe ss in patients with acquired esotropia when the larger, prism -adapted, angle 276 
was targeted for surgery.20 277

29May2019     1-4  278 
This same phenomenon has been observed clinically in other types of strabismus as well.  It is 279 
possible that patients with IXT could prism adapt to a larger angle when base -in prism is used as 280 
treatm ent for IXT.  Because the proposed benefit of prism therapy for IXT is increased time of 281 
bifoveal fusion, patients who  fully  prism -adapt to  the prescribed base -in prism  (no improvement [ADDRESS_1213048] ), would not be expected  to have an y treatment benefit,  and so 283 
will be excluded in th is study. Whereas patient s who do not prism -adapt, or only partially prism - 284 
adapt (a smaller residual angle in  prism, compared with before  prism), are hypothesized to 285 
improve.  286 
 287 
1.9 Determining the Dose of Prism for the Current Study  288 
The consensus of the Planning Committee was to prescribe relieving prism.  This decision was 289 
based primarily on the clinical experience of the Planning Committee.  Consensus was reached 290 
to prescribe a base -in prism magnitude that was 40% of the largest exodeviation at distance or 291 
near for a maximum  eligible exodeviation of 35∆ at both distance and near. This amount of 292 
relieving prism was determined based on Caloroso’s residual vergence demand guidelines,14 293 
prism guidelines from Roper -Hall,18 and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. Given the maximum deviation of 35∆, [ADDRESS_1213049] magnitude of prism to be prescribed will be 14∆ (7∆ for each eye). This magnitude of 295 
ground -in prism was agreed to be feasible in terms of appearance , weight, and optical 296 
aberrations.  The minimum prism dose would be 6∆ (3∆ for each eye) based on the study -defined [ADDRESS_1213050]  16∆ at distance.  [ADDRESS_1213051] been no rigorous studies that address the following important questions related to 310 
prism therapy:  [ADDRESS_1213052] on IXT while wearing 313 
prism (over a number of weeks)?  [ADDRESS_1213053] a long -term therapeutic benefit for IXT while 315 
wearing prism spectacles (over many months or years)?  [ADDRESS_1213054] for IXT when prism spectacles 317 
are tapered and discontinued ? [ADDRESS_1213055] used a “control score” (the proportion of time  that the deviation is [ADDRESS_1213056]) to judge improvement or worsening of IXT or response to treatment.21-24 A single 331 
control score has been found to be highly variable.25 26 Due to this variability, a  more adequate 332 
representation of control during the day can better be achieved by  [CONTACT_869243] “triple control 333 
score,”26 which is a mea n of 3 control measures obtained at various times during an examination.   334 
 335 
Beca use the purpose of the treatment of IXT with prism  spectacles is to better align the eyes for a 336 
greater proportion of time, and single binocular vision with high grade stereoacuity is associated 337 
with good ocular alignment, it is reasonable to primarily focus on “control” of the distance [ADDRESS_1213057] step in evaluating the effectiveness of prism  treatment  as in prior overminus 339 
studies (IXT3, IXT5) .23   340 
 341 
1.13 Timing of Intervention, Outcome for Current S tudy  342 
To eva luate the initial response to prism  spectacles , this 8 -week pi[INVESTIGATOR_83021] 343 
(RCT)  is proposed.  If  a reasonable initial response without significant adverse effect s is found , a [ADDRESS_1213058] would evaluate the long -term effectiv eness of prism  (e.g., over 1 345 
year) and then evaluate the subsequent effectiveness of maintaining control after the prism  346 
treatment has been discontinued ( e.g., 6 months after discontinuation of prism ). This approach [ADDRESS_1213059] (IXT3) , followed by a full -scale longer RCT to evaluate the long -term 349 
effectiveness on treatment and after discontinuation of treatment (IXT5).   350 
 351 
1.14 Study Objective  352 
The objective  of this  short -term, pi[INVESTIGATOR_869233] 353 
prism to spectacles with out prism  is to determine whether to proceed to a full -scale, longer -term 354 
randomized trial . This decision will be based primarily on asses sing the initial (8-week) 355

 Mean distance IXT control score  (the mean of 3 control scores)  (primary  outcome ) 357 
 The proportion of participants demonstrating a “ treatment response, ” defined as ≥1 point 358 
improvement in  the mean distance IXT control  score  without spontaneous exotropia during 359 
control testing (secondary  outcome ) 360 
 The proportion of partic ipants reporting a dverse effects  and good/excellent spectacle wear 361 
compliance  362

 As part of  screening for participants  who are eligible for the randomized trial, an ancillary 450 
study of prism adaptation testing will evaluate the initial response to relieving prism in the 451 
amount which would be prescribed if the participant  were randomized to the pr ism group.  452 
The objective is to define the proportion of pa rticipant s who fully prism adapt after 30 453 
minutes of wearing “trial” relieving prism, defined as no reduction in magnitude of deviation [ADDRESS_1213067] when measured in relieving prism at both distance and  near compared with the 455 
original deviation measured without relieving prism.  456

spectacles  if child currently wears spectacles  or without spectacles  if child is not wearing 569 
spectacle s).*  570 
 571 
* The exception is for a participan t who does not require spectacles per IXT6 protocol 572 
but is wearing a pair of spectacles that do not meet pre-enrollment spectacle tol erances 573 
(see section 2.2 ). This participant  can have enrollment testing performed  with or 574 
without  these spectacle s, provided the visual acuity eligibility criteria are met (see 575 
section 2.2 ).  If visual acuity criteria are not met , the child  is not eligible  at that visit .  576 
 577 
There is no specified “ waiting ” time that needs to occur between enrollment measurements, [ADDRESS_1213077] be performed without cycloplegia and in the following specified order  at 579 
the enrollment visit:  580 
 581 
1. Spectacle Prescription Verification ( Lensometry ):  582 
 Prior to performing the enrollment examination, the participant’s  habitua l spectacle 583 
correction (if worn) is to be  verified using a lensometer  and compared with study 584 
spectacle requirements  using procedures outlined in the IXT6 Testing Procedures 585 
Manual . 586 
2. Symptom  and Spectacle  Survey s:  587

29May2019     2-4 3. Control of the E xodeviation  #1: Control of the exodeviation will be assessed  in the habitual 598 
correction *(see above ) in primary position at distance and near using the PEDIG  IXT 599 
control scale ( see below )29 and as outlined the IXT6 Testing Procedures Manual . 600 
 Distance (6 meters)  – fixing on an accommodative target such as a video or small 601 
letters  602 
 Near 1/3m (33cm) –  fixing on Gulden near fixation target or similar accommodative 603 
target)  604 
 The scale below applies to both distance a nd near separately.  605 
 606 
Intermittent Exotropia Control Scale  607 
5 = Constant Exotropia  608 
4 = Exotropia > 50% of the 30 -second period before dissociation  609 
3 = Exotropia < 50% of the 30 -second period before dissociation  610 
2 = No exotropia unless dissociated, recovers in >5 seconds  611 
1 = No exotropia unless dissociated, recovers in 1 -5 seconds  612 
0 = No exotropia unless dissociated, recovers in <1 second (phoria)  613 
Not applicable =  No exodeviation present  614 
 615 
Directions :  616 
 617 
Step1 : Assessment before any dissociation: Eye alignment is observed for a 30-second 618 
period with distance fixation .  The time in seconds that a spontaneous  IXT is observed  619 
is counte d, and the appropriate control score (3, 4, or 5) is assigned for distance 620 
fixation. This is then repeated for near fi xation  for another 30 -second period ; if an 621 
exotropia is observed, then the time in seconds that an eye is observed to be exotropic  is 622 
counted and  the appropriate  score of 3, 4, or 5 is assigned . If a score of ≥3 is present , 623 
then Step 2 (dissociation) is no t required for that test distance . First distance and then 624 
near fixation are assessed before any dissociation (i.e., before step 2 ). 625 
 626 
Step 2 : Assessment with standardized dissociation is performed only if spontaneous  627 
exotropia is NOT  observed during step 1  (control was not a 3, 4, or 5 ).  Instead, control 628 
will be  a 0, 1, or 2; this is determined based on the worst score determined from  3 629 
successive 10-second periods of dissociation:  630 
 An occluder is placed over the right eye for 10 seconds and then removed ; the 631 
length of time it takes for the re -establishment of fusion is measured  in seconds . 632 
 The left eye is then occluded for a 10 -second period (second assessment under 633 
dissociation) and after uncovering the eye, the time for re-establish ment of  fusion is 634 
simil arly measured  in seconds . 635 
 A third assessment is performed, by [CONTACT_869260] [ADDRESS_1213080] time of the three assessments, if a score of 2  (>5 642 
seconds recovery) is noted on the first or second dissociation, then subsequent 643 
dissociation(s) are not needed.  [ADDRESS_1213081], the 645 
control scale applies to the exodeviation.  646

 Testing must be performed by a pediatric opht halmologist, pediatric optometrist, or [ADDRESS_1213093] . 716 
 Testing must be done without cycloplegia.  717 
 The purpose of testing is to assess a child’s initial response to the amount of relieving 718 
prism that would be prescribed if randomly assigned to the pri sm spectacles group  (see 719 
table 1, section 3.1).  720 
 The examiner will place  BOTH of the following in the IXT6 approved trial frame  and [ADDRESS_1213094]  30 minutes :  722

o Trial prism lenses from the IXT6 trial prism set with protocol -determined amount 725 
of relieving prism (see table 1, section 3.1), with the following caveat : 726 
 To avoid the need for  trial prisms of 3.5∆ for cases in which the t otal prism 727 
magnitude of 7 ∆, a 4∆ prism will be placed in front of the eye that normally 728 
deviates, and 3 ∆ prism will be placed in front of the other eye.    729 
 After 30 minutes  of wearing the prism in trial frames , perfo rm the following  in primary 730 
position while the participant continues to wear the prism trial frames :  [ADDRESS_1213095] determine whether the par ticipant is eligible for 736 
randomization or whether study participation will end.   737 
 738 
Participants ARE eligible to be randomized if ALL of the following criteria are met :  739 
 The participant has not fully adapted to prism at distance AND near  740

both distance and  near. These participants a re now all wearing 40% relieving prism (12∆, 755 
with 6∆ base -in in each lens)  in a trial frame with habitual refractive correction . After [ADDRESS_1213096] measures are given in the following examples : 759 
 760 
Patient is eligible based upon prism adaption and CAN be randomized.  761 
 762 
1. Example 1 - No Prism Adaptation:    763 
Wearing prism, t he participant now measures 18∆ exodeviation  at distance  by [ADDRESS_1213097]  and 18∆ exodeviation  at near by [CONTACT_225827], and no esotropia by [CONTACT_869265] 765 
near.   The angle has decreased by [CONTACT_869266] , so there is no prism 766 
adaptation.  767 
2. Example 2 - Partial Prism Adaptation:    768 
Wearing prism, t he participant now measures 30∆ exodeviation  at distance  by [ADDRESS_1213098]  and 25∆ exodeviation  at near by [CONTACT_225827], and no esotropia by [CONTACT_869265] 770 
near.   The distance angle has not decreased while wearing prism but the near angle 771 
has decreased  while wearing prism . 772 
3. Example 3 – Pre-Existing Micro -Esotropia at Near: 773 
Wearing prism, t he participant measures 18∆ exodeviation  at distance by [CONTACT_869267] 774 
18∆ exodeviation  at near by [CONTACT_225827] , but is esotropic at near by [CONTACT_869268] (reflecting 775 
pre-existing monofixation;  where, in this case,  the tropia and phoria are in the 776 
opposite direction). The esotropia was present prior to prism adaptation.  [ADDRESS_1213099]  angle has decreased by [CONTACT_869266],  so there is no prism 778 
adaptation.   779 
 780 
Patient is NOT eligible based upon prism adaption and CANNOT be randomized.  781 
 782 
1. Example 1 - Full Prism Adaptation:     783 
Wearing prism, t he participant now measures 30∆ exodeviation  by [CONTACT_869264] [ADDRESS_1213100].   The p atient has completely adapted to 785 
the prism  and is NOT eligible  due to complete prism adaptation . 786

 1128  
5.1 Sample Size  1129  
Because this study is  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], sample size has not been statistically calculated.  The sample 1130  
size of 64 partic ipants (32 participant s per group) who pass the prism adap tation test (i.e., do not 1131  
fully prism adapt) is a convenience sample that is expected to provide at least 60 participant s (30 1132  
participant s per group) for analysis after adjusting for  up to 5% loss to follow -up.  1133  
 1134  
The primary analysis section  (section 5.2)  indicate s the level of statistical power/precision that 1135  
the sample size of 30 participants  per group ( 60 total) provides.    1136  
 1137  
5.2 Primary Analysis  1138  
The primary analysis will be an intent -to-treat comparison of mean 8-week control of the 1139  
distance exodeviation (average of 3 measurements)  between t reatment group s using an analysis 1140  
of covariance (ANCOVA) model , which adjusts for baseline distance control.    1141  
 1142  
5.2.1 Decision Guideline for Determining Whether to Proceed to a Randomized Trial   1143  
The data collected in this sh ort-term, pi[INVESTIGATOR_869235]  1144  
whether to proceed to a full -scale, longer -term randomized trial of prism vs. non -prism. A 1145  
decision guideline has been developed to aid in this decision (see below).  The side effect [ADDRESS_1213138] deviation of 8 -week distance control in IXT3 was 1. 5 1152  
points (95% CI = 1. 2 to 1.8 points).  The convenience sample of 64 participants yields relatively 1153  
low statistical power ( 61%) for detecting a difference if the true difference = -0.75 assuming an 1154  
SD in the current study of 1.5 points  and accounting for up to 5% loss to follow up .  As the 1155  
statistical power is poor, the  decision guideline was based  solely  on the size of  the observed 1156  
difference in mean control scores (prism  – non-prism ).  The decision is:  1157  
 Proceed if the observed difference ≤ -0.75 points  1158  
 Uncertain if the observed difference favors the prism  group by [CONTACT_21316] 0.75 points (diff <0 1159  
and > -0.75)  1160  
 Do not proce ed if the observed difference is zero or favors the non -prism  group (diff ≥0) 1161  
 1162  
 1163  
*Note that differences ( prism  – non-prism ) favoring prism  will be negative given that lower 1164  
control scores indicate better control .   1165

* Table cells show the probability of making the given decision if the true difference is the [ADDRESS_1213139] deviation of 1.5 1171  
and 30 participants  per treatment group.  1172  
** The ‘proceed’ row is the  chance of observing a difference of 0.75 points or larger favoring 1173  
prism given var ying assumptions for the true treatment difference.  1174  
 1175  
As seen in Table 1, the  probability of making a  ‘proceed ’ decision when the true mean difference 1176  
is -0.75 point s or larger is 50%, the probability of an ‘uncertain ’ decision is 46% , and the 1177  
probability of a ‘do not proceed ’ decision is 4%.  Even if the true mean difference is as small as  1178  
-0.50 point s, the prob ablility of a “do not proceed” decision is s till low at 11%. 1179

5.3 Secondary Analysis  -- Distance Control  1181  
The secondary analysis will  calculate the proportion (and two -sided 95% confidence interval) of 1182  
participants  with a “treatment response ,” defined as ≥1 point improvement in control of their 1183  
distance exodeviation (average of 3 measurements)  between baseline and the 8 -week outcome 1184  
exam.  1185  
 1186  
5.4 Secondary Analysis – No Spontaneous Tropia  [ADDRESS_1213140]’s test with alpha of 0.05, with calculation of a two - 1189  
sided 95% confidence interval on the difference in proportions.   1190  
 1191  
No spontaneous tropia at the 8-week  primary outcome exam is defined as a score of ≤2 ( 0, 1, or 1192  
2) on all three assessments of control at distance and at near .   1193  
 1194  
5.5 Additional Analyses   1195  
 1196  
5.5.1 Change in Distance Control  1197  
In addition to the primary analysis comparing mean change in distance control between 1198  
treatment groups (see section 5. 2), the distribution of change in distance control will also be [ADDRESS_1213141] . 1200

29May2019     5-3 5.5.2 Near Control  1202  
Near control will be evaluated similarly to the distance control in the primary analysis ( section 1203  
5.2), secondary analyses ( section 5.3, 5.4), and one of the additional analyse s (section 5.5 .1). [ADDRESS_1213142] while wearing prism for analysis of the total 1210  
underlying deviation.  We acknowledge this has limitations as measurement through ground in 1211  
prism is not equivalent to measurement without ground in prism.  The distribution of change in 1212  
ocular alignment will also be described for each treatment group.  1213  
 1214  
5.5.4 Near Stereoacuity  1215  
The distribution of near stereoacuity will be described for the enrollment exam and the outcome 1216  
exam for each treatment group. The distribution of change in near stereoacuity will also be  1217  
described for each treatment group.  1218  
 1219  
5.5.5 Suppression  1220  
As an exploratory analysis, the distribution of suppression level (none, mild, moderate, severe) 1221  
will be described for the enrollment exam and the outcome exam for each treatment group.   1222  
 1223  
5.5.6 Fusional Conv ergence  1224  
As an exploratory analysis, the distribution of fusional convergence amplitude  (break point, blur 1225  
point, and recovery) will be described , and compared between treatment groups for the 1226  
enrollment exam and the outcome exam for each treatment group.  1227  
 1228  
5.5.7 Adverse Symptoms  of Intermittent Exotropia and Prism Spectacle Wear  1229  
Adverse symptoms of IXT will be assessed at enrollment and at the 8 -week outcome exam using 1230  
a symptom survey  that is administered to the child  (see section 2.4 ).  Response options are based 1231  
on frequency of observations : never, sometimes, and always.   1232  
 1233  
Similarly, a dverse symptoms that may be associated with prism spectacle wear will be assessed 1234  
at enrollment and at the 8 -week outcome exam using a spectacle survey that is administered to 1235  
the parent.  Response options are based on frequency of observations: never, rarely, sometimes, 1236  
often, always, and not applicable.  1237  
 1238  
For each survey separately, t he distribution of scores on each survey item will be described for 1239  
the enrollment exam and the  outcome exam for each treatment group.   1240  
 1241  
5.5.8 Distance Visual Acuity  1242  
Distance visual acuity will be assessed at enrollment and at the 8 -week outcome exam . Any 1243  
optotype method can be used for t esting ; however,  the same method must be used at both the 1244  
enrollme nt and 8 -week outcome exam .   1245

29May2019     5-4 The distribution of distance visual acuity measures will be described for the enrollment exam and 1247  
the outcome exam for each treatment group.   The distribution of change in visual acuity will also 1248  
be described for each treatme nt group.   1249  
 1250  
5.5.9 Compliance of Spectacle Wear  1251  
Parents will be asked to complete a compliance calendar by [CONTACT_869278] 1252  
their child has worn the study -prescribed  spectacle correction each day. Proportion of time worn 1253  
each day will be described as excellent (76% to 100%), good (51% to 75%), fair (26% to 50%), 1254  
poor (1  to  25%) , or none (0%).  Based on review of the calendars and discussion with parents at [ADDRESS_1213143]  the total p roportion of time worn as 1256  
excellent (76% to 100%), good (51% to 75%), fair (26% to 50%), poor ( 1 to 25%) , or none (0%: 1257  
did not fill prescription or never pi[INVESTIGATOR_869237] ). 1258  
 1259  
The distribution of com pliance will be assessed for each treatment group  at the outcome exam.  1260  
 1261  
5.5.10   Alternative Approach to Primary Analysis  1262  
A planned secondary analysis will be to repeat the primary analysis ( see section 5.2 ) but limit it [ADDRESS_1213144] based on 1269  
distance control severity (2 to <3, 3 to <4, 4 to 5) is that poorer control  is associated with larger  [ADDRESS_1213145]’s test with alpha of 0.05, with calculation of a two -sided 95% co nfidence interval on the [ADDRESS_1213146] 1296  
in order to enroll 64 participants in the randomized trial.      1297  
 1298  
The analysis will be to estimate the proportion (and 95% confidence interval) of prism adaptation [ADDRESS_1213147] after wearing relieving prism 1300  
for 30 minutes  (measured through the prism)  ≥ original PACT (measured without prism ) at both  1301  
distance and near.  The prism adaptation tests from the initial enrollment visit will be included 1302  
for analysis; repeat enrollment prism adaptation tests will be excluded.     1303

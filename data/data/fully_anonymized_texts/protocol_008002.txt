Purpose of the Study  
  
This prospective double -blind study aims to evaluate the functional benefit of the interspace 
between the popliteal artery and the capsule of the knee (iPACK) block for postoperative physical 
therapy (PT) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).  English speaking ASA 1 -3 patients ages 18 -75 years 
old undergoing primary TKA will be randomized into 2 groups, one receiving 20mL 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 
1:400,000K epi[INVESTIGATOR_858885] 20 mL 0.9% saline. 
The primary outcome will be difference in knee extension within the fi rst [ADDRESS_1196876] risk associated with  nerve blocks, including theoretical risk of nerve damage and local 
anesthetic systemic toxicity.  
 
Background & Significance  
 
Postoperative pain following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) continues to persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a wide 
variety of methods available for an algesia.  The knee joint receives innervation from the [ADDRESS_1196877].  
            A recent randomized -controlled trial has demonstrated  that sciatic nerve blocks reduce pain 
compared with placebo2.  In addition to pain control, sciatic nerve blockade also inhibits motor fibers, 
which limit participation in rehabilitation. In order to decrease motor blockade, Sinha and colleagues 
described  a field block in the interspace between the popliteal artery and capsule of the knee (iPACK)3.  
This technique anesthetizes the nerves supplying the posterior part of the knee, specifically the 
posterior articular nerve and geniculate nerves. This block b ecome part of our comprehensive 
multimodal analgesic regimen for TKA.  While some research has shown not shown efficacy from the 
iPACK block4, emerging data has shown benefit including improved participation in PT and decrease 
time to discharge5,6. No curr ent studies, however, have been performed utilizing our comprehensive 
analgesic protocol, including multimodal analgesia, adductor canal catheter, and iPACK single shot block 
to show improvement in post -operative PT outcomes, specifically knee extension.  Proper knee 
extension is a key component in acute post -operative rehabilitation, allowing the patient to fully 
participate in PT.  Participation in PT improves both long - and short -term outcomes, including 
ambulation and knee flexion and extension7 -9.  The  goal of this prospective double -blind study aims to 
evaluate the benefit of the iPACK block as part of a comprehensive perioperative analgesic pathway for 
TKA in order to evaluate its effects on PT outcomes.  The main outcome our study will address is kne e 
hyperextension.   
 
Design & Procedures  
 
ASA 1 -3 patients aged 18 -75 years old undergoing primary TKA will be enrolled. Patients will be 
identified preoperatively and contact[CONTACT_740980] (WMB) or study 
personnel .  The study will be explained in full detail, after which patients will be given the opportunity to 
ask questions about the study.  If patients are interested in participating, they will be again explained 
the protocol and informed consent will be obtaine d the day of surgery.  
           Patients will be given the standard of care at Duke University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858886].  Preoperatively, patients will be given 975mg acetaminophen 
and 300mg gabapentin by [CONTACT_858891].  These medications may be altered or not given 
depending on patient comorbidities or other extenuating factors such as allergy/intolerance.  
Furthermore, a spi[INVESTIGATOR_858887].  
Patients will be randomized to either iPACK block group or sham group. Prior to patient 
enrollment, group allocations will be determined by [CONTACT_858892] (WMB). To ensure blinding, randomizations wil l be sealed in envelopes numbered 1 -50. Upon 
enrollment, patients will be given a number (1 -52) and the corresponding envelope will be given to a key 
unblinded study personnel member (JG), who will not be involved in the iPACK intervention nor in post -
oper ative analysis. This key member will supply the regional anesthesiologist performing the 
intervention with the study drug -- either 30mL 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_858888], consisting of 30mL 
saline. Both the regional anesthesiologist performing the interventi on and the patient will be blind as to 
the contents of the syringe.  
Following the intervention, patients will be taken to the operating room and sedated using IV 
propofol to a bispectral index (BIS) of 60 -80, indicating adequate sedation. Once sedated, pat ients will 
be given a 0.5mg/kg ketamine bolus (based on ideal body weight) and 10mg dexamethasone will be 
given prior to incision. The orthopedic surgery attending will determine the degree of preoperative knee 
extension prior to the procedure and inform t he anesthesia team. At conclusion of the case sedation will 
be stopped and patient will be taken to the post -operative care unit (PACU).  
Post -operatively, patients will be assessed on arrival to determine level of pain as well as 
nausea/vomiting and for re turn of sensation. Prior to return of sensation, an adductor canal catheter 
will be placed as part of the TKA protocol. In addition to catheter placement, patients will have post -
operative orders for pain control that include 0.2mg IV hydromorphone for pai n scores [ADDRESS_1196878] 8 hours after surgery. Additional measures include knee flexion, distance 
ambulated, and timed -up-and-go (TUG) te st. Furthermore, pain scores and cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_50352] (in IV morphine equivalents) will be recorded for the first 4 hours, at 8 hours, and at 24 
hours following surgery. Complications and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858889].

13) Current or historical evidence of any clinically significant disease or condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_118159], may increase the risk of surgery or complicate the subject’s postoperative course.  
  
Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
Patients will not incur any added risk to standard risks incurred with both general and regional 
anesthesia.  These standards risks are : 
Regional anesthesia - minor pain or discomfort, injury to arteries, veins or nerves affecting the arms or 
legs, residual numbness or weakness or paralysis, headache, muscle soreness, infection, allergy or 
adverse drug reaction, intravascular injection of  local anesthetic causing seizure or cardiac arrest.  
            Patients will be monitored in the post -operative care unit by [CONTACT_153751].  
Patients will have analgesic medications available for pain if needed including 0.2mg hydromorpho ne for 
pain score 5 -7/10 and 0.4mg hydromorphone for pain scores 8 -10/10.  These medications will be given 
every [ADDRESS_1196879].  
 
Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations  
 
A double blinded randomized (1:1) trial assuming a rate of hyperextension of 20% in the placeb o 
group, will provide 91% power to detect a 50% increase in the rate of hyperextension in the treatment 
group in a chi -square test at alpha level 0.05. Sample size and power calculations were performed using 
PASS v15 (NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah).  
            Patient and surgical characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_858893] t -tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, chi -square tests, or Fisher exact 
tests as appropriate. A chi -square test and logistic  regression models will be used to assess the effect of 
treatment on rate of hyperextension. We will report odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p -values 
to assess significance and clinical importance of the observed treatment effect.  Additional mea sures of 
treatment efficacy (range of motion, pain scores, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]) will be summarized overall 
and between groups to further characterize the treatment effect in this population.  Randomization 
schedules will be prepared using mixed block si zes in nQuery and significance will be set at 0.05 for all 
analyses.

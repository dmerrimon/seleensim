Name [CONTACT_3261]:  Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249665]:  A Study to Evaluate the Effect of ALKS  3831 Compared to Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667829], Schizophreniform, or Bipolar I Disorder Who are Early in Their 
Illness  
Investigators:  This is a multinational multicenter study . 
Study Period:  
Estimated date of first subject’s consent: Q2 [ADDRESS_902104]’s last visit : Q4 2021  Phase of Development:  3 
 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
To evaluate the effect of ALKS  3831, compared to olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], on body weight in young adults with 
schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or bipolar I disorder who are early in their illness 
Secondary:  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALKS 3831 in young adults with schizophrenia, 
schizophreniform , or bipolar I disorder who are early in their illness 
Methodology:  This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the effect of 
ALKS  3831 compared to olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667830], 
schizophreniform disorder, or bipolar I disorder who are early in their illness.  
Subjects will be screened at Visit  1, up to 30 days prior to randomization. At Visit 2, eligible subjects will 
be randomized (1:1) to ALKS  3831 or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667831] 12 weeks. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_637] (schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder vs bipolar I 
disorder), region  (US vs non- US), and baseline BMI (<25 vs ≥25) . Subjects on antipsychotic medications 
or mood stabilizers (excluding study medication)  should be tapered off this medication by [CONTACT_667883] 2 (Visit  4). Subjects may be inpatient or outpatient at S creening , however in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684] , all subjects should be appropriate for eventual outpatient treatment. Subjects should be 
outpatient within [ADDRESS_902105] randomization. Cases that require inpatient treatment for longer than 
2 weeks will require review and approval by [CONTACT_27216] a case by [CONTACT_413].  
Starting with W eek 2 (Visit 4), subjects will come for biweekly visits for the remaining 10  weeks. Study 
drug will be provided to subjects as coated bilayer tablets dispensed in blister packs at each visit to be taken at home (one tablet by [CONTACT_249734], preferably at bedtime). The doses of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_407281] 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg and the doses of ALKS 3831 will be 5, 10, 15, or 20  mg olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667832] 
10 mg samidorphan (henceforth will be r eferred to as 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or  20/10 mg). For the first week 
at the discretion of the I nvestigator , subjects will receive 5  mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, or 20 mg of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667833] 5/10 mg, 10/10 mg, 15/10 mg , or 20/10 mg of ALKS  3831. At the end of Week 1, for subjects initiated 
on 5 mg of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_283958] 5/10 mg of ALKS  3831, the dose will be increased to 10 mg of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_283958] 
10/10 mg of ALKS  3831. For all other s ubjects, the dose may also be increased to either  15 or 20 mg of 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_283958] 15/10 or 20/10  mg of ALKS  3831. Following this increase, the dose may be increased or 
decreased to  5, 10, 15, or 20  mg of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or to 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or  20/10 mg of AL KS 3831 at the 
Investigator’s discretion. Dosing will be flexible throughout the study; however, frequent adjustments are 
  Alkermes, Inc . 
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 4 of 69 discouraged. Dose adjustments can only be performed on -site at the study center. Subjects requiring dose 
adjustments between scheduled  visits should arrange an unscheduled visit.  
Body weight, body composition (measured by [CONTACT_667884] [BIA]), and metabolic 
parameters (including fasting triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose) will be measured throughout the 
12-week treatment period. Psychiatric symptoms will be evaluated using the Clinical Global Impressions 
(CGI) scales. Additional assessments will include Impact of Weight on Quality of Life -Lite Questionnaire 
(IWQOL -Lite).  A daily medication adherence monitoring and reminder system (via smartphones ) may  be 
used in this study. In addition, subjects will be asked to participate in a supportive clinical care (S CC) 
program during the 12- week treatment period. Participation in the SCC program will be independent of 
study visits and based on clinician and subject preference. A schematic summarizing study design is 
presented below.  
 
Number of Subjects Planned:  Approximately [ADDRESS_902106] 400 
subjects in the efficacy population (200 per treatment group).  
Main Criteria for Inclusion:  For US sites, men and women ≥16 through <40 years of age at Screening. 
For non- US sites , men and women ≥18 through <[ADDRESS_902107] a body -
mass index (BMI) of <30.0 kg/m2 at Screening and Visit  2, with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders- Fifth Edition ( DSM -5) primary diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, 
or bipolar I disorder and meet Sponsor criteria for previous antipsychotic treatmen t and duration of 
illness. Subjects with bipolar I disorder must have experienced  an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_667834] -[ADDRESS_902108] 14 days prior to Visit 1 . 
Main Criteria for Exclusion:  Subjects may be excluded based on  diagnosis of additional psychiatric 
conditions, use of prohibited or contraindicated drugs and medications, pre-existing medical conditions, abnormal lab results during S creening, participation in any recent clinical trials or previous clinical trials 
of ALKS  [ADDRESS_902109], Dosage, Durat ion, and Mode of Administration:  ALKS  3831 refers to the 
fixed  dose combination of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249674]. ALKS 3831 will be supplied as a coated bilayer 
tablet containing 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_20793] 10 mg samidorphan. The tablet will be taken by [CONTACT_16629], preferably at bedtime, for up to 12 weeks.  
Reference Therapy , Dosage, Duration, and Mode of A dministration:  Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667835], Inc., containing 5, 10, 15, or 20  mg of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667836]. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667837], preferably at bedtime, for up to 12 weeks.  
Duration of Study:  The total study duration will be approximately 20 weeks including a 4 -week 
Screening P eriod, a 12- week T reatment P eriod , and a 4- week Follow-up Period. Subjects completing the 
treatment period  will be eligible to enroll in a long -term safety study ( ALK3831 -A308 ) where it is Screening 12-week Double Blind Treatment PeriodALKS 3831 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, 20/10 mg

maximum for continuous variables, and number [%] of subjects in each category for categorical variables) will be provided by [CONTACT_281707]. Source data f or the summary tables and 
statistical analyses will be presented as subject data listings.  
Study Populations:  The Safety Population will include all randomized subjects who receive at least 
  Alkermes, Inc . 
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 6 of 69 one dose of study drug (ALKS  3831 or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). The efficacy pop ulation, ie full analysis set (FAS), 
will include all subjects in the S afety Population who have at least one post-B aseline weight assessment.  
Efficacy Analyses:  The efficacy analysis will be carried out using the FAS population. The primary 
analysis of the primary endpoint will be carried out using an analysis of covariance method  (ANCOVA)  
based on multiple  imputation (MI) for missing data using on- treatment weight assessments. The model 
will include the treatment group and randomization strata as fac tors and the basel ine weight as the 
covariate. S ensitivity analyses will be carried out to explore the impact of missing data.  
For the categorical  secondary endpoints of proportion of subjects with ≥10% and ≥7% weight gain at 
Week 12, the analyses will be carried out using a logistic regression model based on MI for missing data. 
The model will include the treatment group and randomization strata as factors, and the baseline weight 
as the covariate. For the change from baseline in waist circumference at Week 12, the analysis will be 
based on the ANCOVA method with MI for missing data, same as the primary analysis of the primary 
endpoint. For c hange from baseline in CGI-S within ALKS 3831 Group at Week 12 , the analysis will be  
based on the  mixed model with re peated measurements. The model will include randomization strata, 
treatment, visit, and treatment-by- visit inter action term as factors; the baseline CGI -S value will be 
included as a covariate.  
To control the overall Type I error rate, hierarchical testing will be performed in the following order: (1) percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 12, (2) proportion of subje cts with  ≥10% weight 
gain from baseline at Week 12, (3 ) proportion of subjects with  ≥7% weight gain from baseline at Week 
12, (4) change from baseline in waist circumference at Week 12 , (5) c hange from baseline in CGI -S score 
within the ALKS 3831 Group at Week 12.
 
Safety Analyses:  The safety analysis will be carried out us ing the S afety P opulation. All safety 
assessments will be summarized using descriptive statistics. All safety analyses will be based on observed 
data only, and no missing values will be imputed. Reported AE terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and  summarized by [CONTACT_667886].  
Observed values and change from baseline in laboratory parameters, vital signs, and ECG parameters will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_67486].  
Prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized by [CONTACT_667887] (WHO  ATC) classification system. Listings will be provided for all concomitant 
medications.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses: Listings will be provided for concentrations of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], samidorphan and metabolites of interest. P harmacokinetic concentrations may be used in a subsequent population PK 
analysis conducted outside of this study. 
Sample Size Considerations:  Approximately [ADDRESS_902111]  400 
subjects in the efficacy population  (200 per treatment group). Assuming the percent weight gain at 
week  12 is 5% and  8.5% for ALKS  [ADDRESS_902112] 
deviation of 8% , and a cumulative dropout rate of 35 %, 200 subjects per treatment group ( 400 subjects in 
total) will provide at least 90% power to demonstrate a difference of ALKS  [ADDRESS_902113] Exclusion Criteria  ..........................................................................................22

MINI  v7.[ADDRESS_902124]- and early -epi[INVESTIGATOR_667838] I disorder are critical phases of the diseases 
where optimal antipsychotic efficacy is crucial. Patients in these early stages are at higher risk 
for suicide and violence ( Hawton et al, 2005; Hayes et al, 2015; Hodgins 2008; Kuo et al, 2005) . 
Additionally, many therapeutic experts consider this time in the course of the disease as the best 
opportunity for aggressive treatment in order to retain brain function, alter disease trajectory and 
improve long term treatment outcomes in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (Berk 
et al, 2011; Berk et al, 2009; Lieberman et al, 2006; Tohen et al, 2010) .

and bipolar I disorder (see local olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667840] ) and is regarded as a highly effective treatment 
with demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy and decreased incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms. 
However, the greater antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667841] ( Allison et al, 1999; Leucht et al, 2013; Lieberman et al, 2005; Meyer et al, 
2008; Wirshing et al, 1999) . Drug -induced weight gain is a major problem in terms of reduced 
adherence, treatment discontinuation, and exposure to serious long- term obesity -related risks that 
may shorten life expectancy. In the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667842] a rapid and 
significant decrease in Positive and  Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)  and Clinical Global 
Impressions- Severity (CGI -S) scores , as well as the least hospi[INVESTIGATOR_667843] , and the lowest all-cause discontinuation 
rate. How ever, a larger proportion of subjects in the olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_179415] (9%) discontinued 
treatment during the 18  month period due to drug-induced weight and metabolic issues compared 
to the other treatment groups (quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]: 4%; risperidone:  2%; perphenazine:  1%; and 
ziprasidone: 3% ; (Lieberman et al, 2005 ). Furthermore, for subjects in the olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667844] ( BMI ) ≤30 kg/m
2, weight increased over the study duration (4.7% at 
12 weeks,  7.7% at 24 weeks,  9.3% at 48 weeks , and 10.1% at 60 weeks). From a physician’s 
perspective, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-induced weight gain and metabolic issues, not lack of efficacy, are the 
primary reasons for discontinuing or not starting treatment with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667845] a second -line treatment in patients early in illness according to 
the Schizophrenia Patien t Outcomes Research Team (PORT) treatment guidelines  (Buchanan et 
al, 2010) . This is largely due to the fact that olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-induced weight gain and metabolic risk 
are especially pronounced in patients who are early in illness  for both schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder ( Correll et al, 2014) . 
Alkermes is developi[INVESTIGATOR_182000] 3831 as a fixed-dose combination of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249674] 
(a µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2634]) to address the serious side effect of weight gain and metabolic 
consequences associated with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646]. The novel combination of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667846]  [ADDRESS_902125] been treated with multiple different antipsychotics and who are later in the 
course of their illness. 
A Phase 2 study (Study ALK3831-302) was conducted to evaluate the antipsychotic efficacy and 
body weight effect of ALKS  3831 in adults with established schizophrenia (first antipsychotic 
treatment lasted longer than 1  year, symptoms lasting greater than 2  years). In Part A (a 12 -week, 
double-blind, randomized, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-controlled phase), ALKS 3831 demonstrated similar 
antipsychotic efficacy compared with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], based on PANSS total score. ALKS 3831 also led to clinically and statistically significantly  less body weight gain compared to olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
In a 24-week Phase 3 study ( ALK3831-A303 ) comparing ALKS [ADDRESS_902126] circumference in subjects with schizophrenia. Subjects treated with ALKS 3831 gained less weight across a range 
of clinically meaningful  cutoffs, and had a lower mean percent change in body weight at the end 
of the treatment period . The inclusion of samidorphan in ALKS 3831 limited olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-induced 
weight gain and retained similar antipsychotic efficacy.  
In a 52- week open- label Phase 3 study ( ALK3831-A306) designed t o evalu ate the long -term 
safety and tolerability of ALKS 3831 in subjects with schizophrenia, ALKS 3831 was generally 
well tolerated and continued antipsychotic efficacy was observed. 
A Phase 3 study ( ALK3831-A305) was conducted to evaluate antipsychotic efficacy  and safety 
in adults with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. In the  4-week  study ALKS 3831 
demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy as evidenced by a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful improvement in PANSS and CGI- S scores relative to placebo .  
Another open- label Phase 3 study ( ALK3831- A304 ) is ongoing to assess the efficacy, associated 
weight changes , and long- term safety of ALKS  [ADDRESS_902127] of ALKS  3831 compared to olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667847], schizophreniform, or bipolar I disorder with a recent onset of symptoms and early in medical treatment.  
5.2. Study Drugs  
In this study , a fixed -dose combination of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667848] a 
single bilayer tablet. The following sections provide an overview of samidorphan and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Detailed information about the study drugs can be found in the current ALKS 3831 Investigator’s Brochure . 
5.2.1. Samidorphan 
Samidorphan is a new molecular entity in clinical development by [CONTACT_43421]. Samidorphan is a µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2634]. It is currently being investigated in combination with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667849] t reatment of schizophrenia (ALKS 3831) and in combination with buprenorphine for the 
treatment of major depressive disorder (ALKS 5461). Based on its chemical structure, 
samidorphan is considered a Schedule II controlled substance according to the US Drug 
Enforcement Agency , and will require proper handling (see Section  10). At least [ADDRESS_902128] been conducted to date, eight  of which included subjects that

[ADDRESS_902129] been exposed to samidorphan as a single agent , or in combination with 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667850] . Commonly reported 
adverse events (AEs) observed across all studies included nausea, fatigue, and somnolence. Overall, no trends or clinically meaningful changes have been observed in clinical laboratory 
analytes, vital sign parameters, or electrocardiogram (ECG) data.  
5.2.2. Olan zapi[INVESTIGATOR_667851] 20 years as a treatment f or schizophrenia 
and bipolar I disorder (see local olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667840] ). The  safety and tolerability profile of 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_249682], supported by [CONTACT_667888] 20 years (see local olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667840]) . Commonly reported AEs consistent across all or most 
dosage forms in short- term, placebo -controlled trials include somnolence, constipation, dry 
mouth, accidental injury, weight gain, postural hypotension, dizziness, asthenia, fever, and abnormal gait.  
5.3. Study Rationale  
This study will be the first study to evaluate the effect of ALKS  [ADDRESS_902130] antipsychotic treatment or since the onset of initial symptoms. The  effects of 
the combination of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667852]. 
Significant weight gain is seen in both schizophrenia and bipolar subjects treated with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_321712], thus, it is important to include both diagnoses in a study assessing, in particular,  the 
differences in weight gain s een between olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_530681] 3831. The onset of schizophrenia 
is rare before the age of 13 , but the rate steadily increases in adolescence, with a peak onset 
of 15 to 30 years  (Sham et al, 1994) . The most common age of onset of bipolar disorder is 
17 to  21 years  (with a mean a ge of onset of 18 years  (Merikangas et al, 2007 ). As the age of 
onset of both disorders is frequently around 18 years old or slightly younger, it was decided in this study to permit the  inclusion in the US of older adolescent  subjects  (≥16  years old). 
Schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are both characterized by a typi[INVESTIGATOR_667853] - to mid -twenties ( American Psychiatric Association 2013 ; Blanco et al, 2016) . Gender 
differences have been described wit h schizophrenia such that women tend to experience their 
first epi[INVESTIGATOR_667854], showing a peak age of onset in the late twenties, with a second peak in the mid - to late -forties  (Hafner 2003; Rabinowitz et al, 2006) . Given the range of ages over 
which patients can be considered early in illness, this study will include young adults and 
adolescents, ages  [ADDRESS_902131]  the antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
Thus, a ll subjects  in this study  will be treated with active antipsychotic treatment. It is expected 
that the antipsychotic efficacy will be similar in both treatment arms. The antipsychotic efficacy of treatment during the study will be assessed by [CONTACT_87791] -S and CGI -Improvement (CGI-I ) 
scales , which quantify clinicians’ overall impression of clinica l severity and clinical change in

Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 17 of 69 individuals’ psychiatric condition ( Leppi[INVESTIGATOR_318658], 2011) . The CGI scales have been widely used  
as a primary outcome measure in clinical trials of medications for depression, schizophrenia, and 
many other illness conditions (including bipolar disorder; ( Spearing et al, 1997) . Relapse of 
schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or bipolar I disorder will be defined by a worsening in 
a subject’s CGI -S score or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_667855]. Additional 
inform ation regarding nonclinical and clinical studies conducted to date with ALKS  3831 is 
available i n the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
5.4. Dose Rationale  
The selected doses of ALKS  [ADDRESS_902132] that data from Study  ALK3831-302 demonstrated no correlation between the ratio of 
samidorphan/olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667856] B aseline in body weight after [ADDRESS_902133] in reducing olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-induced weight gain. 
All subjects will be randomized to receive ALKS  3831 or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Treatment assignment will 
be blinded; however, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667857]. The doses of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_407281] 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg , and the doses of AL KS 3831 will be 5, 10,15, or 20 mg olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667858] 10 mg samidor phan (henceforth referred to as 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or 20/10 mg).  
5.5. Benefit-R isk Assessment  
As stated in the background section, first- and early -epi[INVESTIGATOR_667838] I disorder 
are critical phases of the diseases , where optimal antipsychotic efficacy is crucial. Treatment 
with ALKS [ADDRESS_902134] of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667859]. The antipsychotic efficacy seen in stable subjects treated in study ALK3831-302 was similar between ALKS 3831 and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667860]. Based on the available data from the completed studies in healthy 
volunteers ( ALK33 -301) and in subjects with schizophrenia (ALK3831-302) , subjects treated 
with ALKS [ADDRESS_902135] been shown to gain less weight compared to subjects treated  with 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_582419]. In ALK3831-302, the prevention of weight gain persisted  during the 3-month 
ALKS 3831 treatment period. 
The important identified risks associated with the use of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667861], glucose 
dysregulation , and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. For additional information on the known risks of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
see the local label. The safety profile of ALKS 3831 is consistent with that of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (see 
local label). In study ALK3831-302, the only adverse events reported with ALKS 3831 treatment 
occurring in ≥5% of subjects and at ≥[ADDRESS_902136] common adverse events noted in clinical studies in >2% of subjects with  ALKS [ADDRESS_902137] abnormal (see current ALKS 3831 Investig ator’s

Subjects will be screened at Visit  1, up to 30 days prior to randomization. At Visit 2, eligi ble 
subjects will be randomized  1:1 to ALKS 3831 or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and receive study drug for up to 
12 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_637] (schizophrenia/schizophreniform 
disorder vs bipolar I disorder), region  (US vs non- US), and baseline BMI (<25 vs ≥25) . Subjects  
on antipsychotic medication s or mood stabilizers (excluding study medication) should be tapered 
off this medication by [CONTACT_941] e nd of W eek 2 (Visit 4). Subjects may be inpatient or outpatient at 
Screening ; however , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], all subjects should be appropriate for 
eventual outpatient treatment. Subjects should be outpatient within 2 weeks postrandomization. 
Cases that require inpatient treatment for longer than 2  weeks will require review and approval 
by [CONTACT_27216] a case by [CONTACT_413].  
Starting with W eek 2 (Visit  4), subjects will come for biweekly visits for the remaining 
10 weeks. Study drug will be provided to subjects as coated bilayer tablets dispensed in blister 
packs at each visit to be taken at home (one tablet by [CONTACT_249734], preferably at bedtime). For the first week , at the discretion of the Investigator , subjects will receive 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg

to 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or 20/10 m g of ALKS  3831 at the Investigator’s discretion. Dosing will be 
flexible throughout the study; however, frequent adjustments are discouraged. Dose adjustments can only be performed on-site at the study center. Subjects requiring dose adjustments between scheduled visits should arrange an unscheduled visit for the following procedures: study drug 
return and dispensation, adherence review, AE, and concomitant medication monitoring. 
Body weight, body composition (measured by [CONTACT_667884] [B IA] using a 
Body Composition Analyzer), and metabolic parameters (including fasting triglycerides, 
cholesterol , and glucose) will be measured throughout the 12- week treatment period. Psychiatric 
symptoms will be evaluated using the CGI  scales. Additional a ssessments will include Impact of 
Weight on Quality of Life – Lite Questionnaire (IWQOL -Lite).  A daily medication adherence 
monitoring and reminder system (via smartphones) may  be used in this study. In addition, 
subjects will be asked to participate in a supportive clinical care (SCC) program during the 12-week treatment period. Participation in the SCC program will be independent of study visits and based on clinician and subject preference.  
The total study duration will be approximately 20 weeks , including a 4- week S creening Period, a

Investigator or designated study personnel, as outlined in Section  17.3. 
Prior to the administration of any study -specific procedures, authorized study personnel will 
obtain written informed consent /assent , as per local requirements , from each potential subject. 
8.3.2. Eligibility Review  
An eligibility review will be conducted by [CONTACT_667893] [ADDRESS_902161] randomization .  
8.3.3. Demographics and Medical  / Psychiatric  History  
Subject’s demographic data and medical /psychiatric  history will be reviewed and documented at 
the timepoint specified in Table 3. 8.3.4. Concomitant Medication  Review  
All me dications (prescription and nonprescription, including vitamins and herbal supplements) 
taken by a given subject within 60 days of Screening through Follow-up will be recorded. This 
includes review and recording of all psychotropic and antips ychotic medications.  
At each study visit (see  Table 3), the Investigator or designee will record the following data on 
all me dications used by [CONTACT_423]: name, dose, regimen, route of administration, start and stop 
dates , and the indication for use.  
8.3.5. Vital Signs  
Vital signs (ie, blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral body temperature) will be assessed at the timepoints specified in Table 3. An effort will be made to consistently use the 
same arm (preferably the subject’s dominant arm) to measure blood pressure and heart rate throughout the study. The blood pressure cuff will be calibrated per study site standard operating procedures (SOP). Automated measurement is preferred, but if performed manually, heart rate will be measured in the brachial artery for at lea st [ADDRESS_902162] 5 minutes.  Vital signs may be collected at any time during a 
scheduled visit, unless otherwise noted. 
8.3.6. Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed at the timepoints specified in Table  3. Full physical 
examination at S creening (Visit  1); brief physical examination at all other indicated visits.  
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.[ADDRESS_902163] multiple measures related to body composition using 
BIA, including, but not limited to , weight, fat mass, lean mass, and percentage body fat , at all the 
timepoints specified in Table 3. 
For the Body Composition Analyzer measurements, subjects should be asked to void 
immediately prior to measurement and should be dressed in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_667866]- attire for ea ch measurement. Subjects should remove all personal items (including shoes, 
watches , and jewelry ) and they should be weighed on a study-approved and calibrated scale for 
each measurement under the same conditions. The body composition analysis should not be performed when the subject is attached to any portable electronic equipment ( eg, a portable ECG 
machine). 
8.3.8. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A [ADDRESS_902164] ECGs and assess ECG results using equipment that has been 
calibrated according to the site’s SOP . The following ECG parameters will be collected: pulse, 
RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF , and QT interval corrected using the Bazett fo rmula (QTcB).  
All ECGs  will be evaluated by a central reader.  
8.3.9. Structured Interviews and Questionnaires  
Brief descriptions of each of the interviews and questionnaires to be distributed are available 
below. All interviews and questionnaires will be administered by [CONTACT_249733]. 
For assessments performed at multiple visits, every effort should be made to pair the same 
clinician/rater with the same subject across visits.  
Table 3 provides information on the timepoints at which each assessment should be administered.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rater Review  
Rater (ie, study staff) accuracy for the MINI interview at Screening will be reviewed by [CONTACT_582461].  Rater review is necessary for mitigating inaccurate inclusion/exclusion assessments.  
Rater assessments require subject interviews to be audio recorded. The audio recording will be disclosed and explained to the subject by [CONTACT_667894]. No subject will be recorded without the knowledge that a recording is being made.

subject from participation immediately , as indicated in Section  7.3 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urine Pregnancy Testing  
A urine pregnancy test will be administered  to all women at the timepoints  specified in Table 3. 
Results must be negative for the subject to be eligible for the study at S creening (Visit 1) and 
Baseline (Visit 2).  As highlighted in Section  7.3, a positive pregnancy test result at any time will 
necessitate the subject’s immediate withdrawal from the study. Additional follow -up may be 
necessary , as indicated in  Section  8.4.1. 
8.3.12. Serology Testing 
A blood sample for a serology panel testing for hepatitis B surface antigen, anti -hepatitis  C 
antibodies, and HIV  will be performed at S creening only , as specified in Table  3. A positive 
hepatitis C antibody test must be confirmed by [CONTACT_667895]. 
8.3.13. Genotype Sampling  
A blood sample may be collected (at the timepoint indicated in Table 3) for evaluation of 
genotypes that are potentially related to response and to explore potential genetic associations with efficacy, adverse effects, symptoms , or outcomes. No other tests will b e performed with 
these samples.  
8.3.14. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Concentrations of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], samidorphan, and metabolites of interest will be determined from plasma samples collected according to the schedule in Table 3. The time of last study drug 
admi nistration (when applicable) and the time of each pharmacokinetic ( PK) blood draw must be 
documented in the subject’s source documents. Samples for PK analysis will be stored 
at -20°C ±10°C. P harmacokinetic data from these samples may be included in a subsequent 
population PK analysis or other post-hoc analyses conducted outside of this study. 
8.3.15. Randomization

information will be explained to/reviewed with the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication Adherence and Reminder System  
A daily medication adherence monitoring and reminder system (via smartphones) may  be used in 
this study to  automatically  confirm medication ingestion. After confirmation, all collected data 
and video recordings will be encrypted and may be transmitted to a  secure centralized location , 
in accordance with local regulations , for further analysis, including testing for duplicate 
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.[ADDRESS_902169] (HIPAA), which protects the privacy and security of 
healthcare information. In addition, built- in reminders and a communication system will allow 
real-time interve ntion in case of drug interruptions. Phone numbers of the patients may also be 
collected and stored in an encrypted manner. At no time is the phone number visible to healthcare providers or monitoring personnel. Use of this system will in no way supersede or replace the physician - and/or trial-prescribed medication protocol of the patients. 
8.3.17. Emergency Treatment Card  
An emergency treatment card will be distributed to each subject at S creening ( Visit 1) and 
collected at Visit 9. The card will indicate that the  subject is receiving an opi[INVESTIGATOR_667869]/or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and will include the PI’s contact [CONTACT_3031], a suggested pain management 
plan, and information regarding opi[INVESTIGATOR_249694]. Subjects will be instructed to keep the card with 
them at all times. S tudy personnel will confirm that subjects have the card in their possession at 
each study visit.  
8.3.18. Adverse Event Monitoring  
All AEs will be monitored continuously from the time a subject signs the informed consent document until the completion of the final s tudy visit (see Table 3). A dverse event s and serious 
AEs (SAEs) are defined in Section  13.[ADDRESS_902170] dose of study drug, unless they are surgically  sterile or postmenopausal (see below). 
The following are considered acceptab le methods of contraception: 
1. Intrauterine device  
2. Oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_229370] (eg, a vaginal ring, contraceptive patch, contraceptive implant)  
3. Double-barrier protection (eg, a condom with spermicide or a diaphragm with spermicide)  
4. Abstinence (see below)  
Subjects who are abstinent are eligible, provided they agree to use an acceptable contraceptive 
method should they become sexually active. Abstinence is defined as “true abstinence” in which 
subjects must refrain from hete rosexual in tercourse for the full duration of the study and  must be 
in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to the study drug, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.[ADDRESS_902171] be submitted to Alkermes via Premier Research Group Limited 
(per Section  13.5) immediately , within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy, irrespective of 
whether an AE has occurred. The pregnancy will be followed until completion or termination. If 
the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for classification as an SAE , it should be 
reported f ollowing the SAE procedure (see Section  13.5).  
8.4.2. Prohibited Medications  
The use of any antipsychotic other than study drug is prohibited, except when subjects are tapering off of current medication (see Section  8.1). T he following medications will be 
prohibited for the duration of the study, unless otherwise indicated : 
• The following psychotropic medications, other than study drug: 
− Antipsychotics (subjects must be tapered off any previous antipsychotic 
medications within 14 days after randomization) 
− Antidepressants for bipolar I disorder subjects at V isit 1 and V isit 2 ( subjects may 
be initiated on antidepressants after Visit 2, as described in Section  8.4.3) 
− Mood stabilizers (subjects must be tapered off any mood stabilizer medications 
within 14 days  after randomization)  
• Chantix
® (varenicline; however , nicotine replacement therapy , including nicotine 
replacement patch and oral nicotine gum, is permitted)

(prescription medications, OTC medications, or dietary supplements) within 30 days 
before randomization through Follow-up (refer to Appendix A  for a list of CYP3A 
inhibitors and inducers) 
The CRO Me dical Monitor should be consulted for any questions about use of any psychotropic 
medications during a subject’s participation in this study.  
8.4.3. Permitted Medications  
• Medications that exhibit drug interaction potential with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], including known inhibitors and inducers of CYP1A2 ( Appendix B ), may affect olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_667870]. Hence, investigators must use caution with inhibitors and inducers of CYP1A2 and monitor for need for study drug dose adjustment  
• Medicinal products known to be associated with increase in QTc interval should be used with caution given the increased risk of torsade de pointes ( Appendix C ) 
• Oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_229370] (eg, a vaginal ring, 
contraceptive patch, contraceptive implant) will be permitted  
• Antidepressants 
− Bipolar I disorder: Antidepressants are not permitted at V isit 1 and V isit 2. 
However, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant may be 
initiated during the  Treatment P eriod , if clinically indicated. Treatment with 
SSRI s that may cause significant weight gain should be avoided (eg, paroxetine). 
− Schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder: May remain on the medication if 
stable on antidepressants for greater than 30 days prior to study entry. However, 
an SSRI  antidepressant may be initiated during the T reatment P eriod , if clinically 
indicated. Treatment with SSRIs that may cause significant weight gain should be avoided (eg, paroxetine). 
8.4.4. Pain Management 
Because ALKS  [ADDRESS_902172] should include the following: 
• Regional analgesia or use of non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] 
• If opi[INVESTIGATOR_182023], the subject should be continuously monitored, in an anesthesia care setting, by [CONTACT_667896]. The opi[INVESTIGATOR_530723], specifically the establishment and the maintenance of a patent airway and assi sted ventilation

Page 42 of 69 9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
9.1. Study Drug Dose and Administration  
Study drugs include: 
• ALKS  3831 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or 20/10 mg, administered as a coated bilayer tablet  
• Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 5, 10, 15, or [ADDRESS_902173] week , at the discretion of the I nvestigator, subjects will receive  5, 10, 15, or 20 mg 
of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_283958] 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or 20/10 mg of A LKS  3831. At the end of W eek 1, for 
subjects initiated on 5  mg of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_283958] 5/10 mg of ALKS  3831, the dose will be increased to 
10 mg of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_283958] 10/10 mg of ALKS  3831. For all other subjects, the dose may also be 
increased to either  15 or 20 mg of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or  15/10 or 20/10 mg of ALKS  3831. Following 
this increase, the dose may be increased or decreased to 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or 
to 5/10, 10/10, 15/10, or 20/10 mg of ALKS 3831, at the Investigator’s discretion. Dosing will be 
flexible throughout the study; however, frequent adjustments are discouraged. Dose adjustments can only be performed on- site at the study center.  
For subjects requiring initial inpatient care, study drug  will be administered orally, once daily , 
preferably at bedtime. Following discharge, subjects will be given study drug to take home and 
will be instructed to take one tablet orally , preferably at bedtime. If there are tolerability 
problems, dosing may be switched to another time, based on the judgment of the Investigator; 
frequent switching is discouraged. 
Subjects will be instructed to keep all unused tablets in their blister card and to return unused 
tablets to the study site at their next visit. If dosing is to occur at that visit, the dose should be taken from the subject’s next blister card, not from the card they are returning.  
If a dose is missed or forgotten, subjects will be instructed to resume regular dosing the 
following night. Subjects will be instructed not to take a double dose to try to “make up” for the missed dose. 
9.2. Treatment Adherence  
A daily medication adherence monitoring and reminder system (via smartphones) may  be used in 
this study  (as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Subjects will be instructed to keep all unused tablets 
in their original containers  and to return the original containers with any unused study drug at 
each visit following dispensation. Study drug accountability will be documented as the number of tablets dispensed, dosed, lost/missing, or remaining. If applic able, the site will discuss 
nonadherence with the subject.  
9.3. Randomization/Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at baseline (Visit 2) will be randomized in a (1:1) ratio to 
ALKS  3831 or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_637] 
(schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder vs bipolar I disorder) , region (US vs non- US), and 
baselin e BMI (<25 vs ≥25) . 
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 43 of 69 Randomization will be performed centrally through an Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS). A unique randomization number will be assigned by [CONTACT_582465]. Once a randomization number has been assigned, that number must not be used again if, for example, a subject is withdrawn from the study. Codes will be prepared by [CONTACT_667897]. 
9.4. Blinding  
All Alkermes staff, CRO staff, clinical staff, subjects , and caregivers will be blinded to treatment 
assignment until database lock. 
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_530724]- related medical decisions. If the Investigator deems it necessary 
to break the study blind in the interest of a subject’s medical safety, he or she is encouraged  to 
contact [CONTACT_2024] /Sponsor M edical Monitor to discuss their rationale for unblinding. However, to 
prevent delays to the I nvestigator or medical personnel responding to a potentially emergent 
situation, unblinding of study drug will not be dependent upon the Investigator receiving

Page 49 of 69 13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Safety will be assessed on the basis of:  
• AEs 
• Vital signs (ie, oral temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and heart rate)  
• Clinical laboratory parameters , including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
• ECG results  
• C-SSRS  
13.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject who has 
been administered a pharmaceutical product. The occurrence, which may or may not have a causal relationship with the investigational treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory change that does not commonly occur in that subject and is considered clinically significant. 
Illnesses present prior to the subject signing the ICF are considered to be pre-existing conditions 
and are documented on the medical history eCRF. Pre -existing conditions that worsen during the 
study are entered on the AE eCRF.  
All out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_737]. Clinically significant values will be c onsidered AEs and will be 
recorded as such on the eCRFs.  
Pregnancy is not considered an AE, although a subject will be withdrawn from the study if a pregnancy occurs. As described in Section  8.4.1, the pregnancy, including a partner’s pregnancy, 
must be reported to Alkermes, and additional follow-up may be required. 
Transition from schizophreniform to schizophrenia is not considered an AE, unless deemed so by 
[CONTACT_737].  
13.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality, that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. The subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs. This does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent and significant disability /incapacity (eg, a su bstantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.[ADDRESS_902180] and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203823] a non medical reason (ie, social stay admission) 
during the study, in the absence of an untoward medical occurrence, will not be considered an 
SAE , but will be reported as an AE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249708]-
related issues should be reported as an SAE. 
13.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The assessment of study drug relationship to each AE will be reported on the appropriate source document (and SAE form, in the event of an SAE) by [CONTACT_737] (or designated 
Subinvestigator) according to his/her best clinical judgment. T he criteria listed in Table [ADDRESS_902181] be present to be indicative 
of a particul ar drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “test drugs” for the purposes of 
the definitions listed in the table.

completion of the S afety Follow-up V isit (Visit 11). Any AE or SAE having an onset after the 
Safety Follow-up V isit will not be collected or reported unless the Investigator feels that the 
event may be related to the study drug. 
Subjects will be instructed by [CONTACT_203871]. 
All volunteered, elicited, and observed AEs are to be recorded on the AE eCRFs. 
The Investigator will assess all AEs regarding any causal relationship to the stud y drug 
(see Section  13.3) , the intensity (severity) of the event, action taken, and subject outcome. 
The following criteria should be used to guide the assessment of intensity (severity):  
• Mild:  Causes awareness of sign or symptom, but is easily tolerated; does not interfere 
with usual activities  
• Moderate:  Causes discomfort enough to interfere with usual activities  
• Severe:  Is incapacitating; results in  inability to work or perform usual activities  
All AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by [CONTACT_737] , or until the 
subject is deemed by [CONTACT_16781]-up. 
For clinical study safety reporting purposes, the most recent version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure w ill be used as the reference document to designate event expectedness.  
Withdrawal from the study as a result of an AE, and any therapeutic measures that are taken , 
shall be at the discretion of the Inves tigator . If a subject withdraws from the study for any reason , 
any ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by [CONTACT_737], or until the subject is deemed by [CONTACT_16781] -up.

two-sided significance level of 0.05. 
14.2. General Statistical Methodology 
The statistical analysis methods are described below. Additional details are provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . 
Baseline is defined as  the last nonmissing values on or before the first dose of study drug in the 
double-blind T reatment Period. 
In general, summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for 
continuous variables, and number [%] of subjects in each category for categorical variables) will 
be provided by [CONTACT_281707]. 
Source data for the summary tables and statistical analyses will be presented as subject data 
listings.  
All statistical tests and confidence intervals, unless stated otherwise, will be two-sided and will 
be set at α=0.05.  
14.2.1. Study Populations 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Population 
The S afety Population, defined as all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
drug (ALKS  3831 or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) , will be used in the safety analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy Population 
The E fficacy P opulation (i e, full analysis set [ FAS]), defined as all subjects in the S afety 
Population who have at least one postbaseline weight assessment, will be used in the efficacy 
analyses.  
14.3. Demographics and Baseline Data  
Demographics and baseline characteristics , such as gender, age, race, weight, BM I, and 
psychiatric history, will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  If there are heterogeneities 
between study groups in any of the subject characteristics that are of clinical importance or could affect the treatment outcome, the impact of the imb alances will be investigated and, if necessary, 
appropriate adjustments will be made in the efficacy and safety analyses.

Protocol ALK3831-A307 Amendment 5.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 55 of 69 14.4. Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses will be based on the FAS Population.  
Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is: 
• Percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 12 
The primary analysis will be carried out using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) method 
based multiple  imputation (MI) for missing data. The model will include the treatment group and 
randomization strata as factor s, and the baseline weight as the covariate. Sensitivity analyses will 
be carried out to explore the impact of missing data. 
Secondary Endpoint s 
The secondary endpoints are: 
• Proportion of subjects with ≥10%  weight gain at Week 12  
• Proportion of subjects with ≥7%  weight gain at Week 12  
• Change from baseline in  waist circumference at Week 12  
• Change from baseline in CGI -S score within the ALKS 3831 Group at Week 12 
For the categorical secondary endpoints of p roportion of subjects with ≥10%  and ≥7%  weight 
gain at Week [ADDRESS_902186] circumference at 
Week 12, the analysis will be based on the ANCOVA method with MI for missing data, same as 
the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. For change from baseline in CGI- S within 
ALKS  3831 Group at Week 12, the analysis will be based on the mixed model with repeated 
measurements  (MMRM) . The model will include randomization strata, treatment, visit, and 
treatment -by-visit interaction term as factors; the baseline CGI -S value will be included as a 
covariate.  
To control the overall Type I error rate, hierarchical testing will be performed in the following order: (1) percent change from baseline in body weight at W eek 12 , (2) proportion of subjects 
with ≥10% weight gain from baseline at W eek 12 , (3) proportion of subject s with  ≥7% weight 
gain from baseline at Week 12 , (4) c hange from baseline in waist circumference at Week 12 , (5)

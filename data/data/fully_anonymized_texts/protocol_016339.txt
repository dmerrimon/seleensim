Research Proposal0.0 STUDY AIMS AND OBJECTIVES 
This is a single-blinded multi-institutional randomized controlled trial to evaluate the  effectiveness of 
Arista hemostatic matrix powder (Arista® AH, C. R. Bard, Inc. Davol, Warwick, RI) in reducing drainage 
output in anterolateral thigh (ALT)  free flap donor sites.   Increased drainage from donor sites can lead to  
seroma formation with possible secondary infection, delayed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and additional home 
care needs for  drain care.  Arista is an inert plant based absorbable surgical hemostatic powder that can 
be easily applied to broad surgical fields to reduce bleeding and seroma rates.  Therefore, its application 
to free flap donor sites may bear significant potential benefit.   
Specific Aim 1: The  main hypothesis of the study is that the  use of Arista in anterolateral thigh (ALT)  free 
flap donor sites prior to  closure will reduce postoperative drain outputs and time to drain removal 
compared to ALT donor sites closed without Arista. 
Specific Aim 2: This study will also evaluate the secondary hypotheses that Arista will reduce 
postoperative ALT donor site seromas and patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]. 
1.0 INTRODUCTION  
Free tissue transfer is a commonly performed procedure, especially at tertiary care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].   In free 
tissue transfer, “spare tissue” from one area of the  body (donor site) is re-implanted to an area that is 
need of reconstruction (defect site).   When relocated, the “spare tissue” is given vitality and blood supply 
at its new location by [CONTACT_96730][INVESTIGATOR_534728].   Hence, this operation is referred to as “microvascular free tissue transfer” 
or “free flap”.    Defect sites most commonly result from tumor or cancer removal and trauma related 
injuries.   Free flaps are frequently used to  reconstruct breast tissue after mastectomy, head and neck 
cancer resections, extremity injuries, and chronically infected wounds.   The  indications, utilization, and 
expertise in free flap surgery continue to grow, providing patients with enhanced outcomes of otherwise 
difficult cancers and wounds.  Since its original description in [ADDRESS_694472] been shown to  be a reliable method 
for several reconstructive procedures with minimal  donor site morbidity.2-4  The  ALT free flap is composed 
of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fat of the anterolateral thigh.   The blood supply to  this area is from the 
lateral circumflex femoral artery and vein (Figure  1).  These vessels along with the tissues of the 
anterolateral thigh are carefully dissected and removed as a single unit to be re-implanted in a different 
part of the body (Figure  2).   
Figure  1. Anterolateral thigh free flap anatomy. 

Use of  Arista in ALT Free Flap Donor Sites
[ADDRESS_694473] reported seroma rates in ALT donor sites as high as 5% although this likely 
underestimates the true incidence of clinically significant postoperative fluid collections and wound 
complications in this patient population.[ADDRESS_694474] $2,[ADDRESS_694475] $80,[ADDRESS_694476].  Once studied in a controlled single flap environment, 
these methods could be then expanded to other or all free flap donor sites.  
According to  the manufacturer, Arista uses Microporous Polysaccharide Hemospheres (MPH) technology 
to catalyze the clotting cascade and effectively dehydrate tissue to initiate hemostasis in broad areas. 
Major advantages of Arista are that it has been shown to be safe and effective across multiple surgical 
disciplines, is completely absorbed in 24-[ADDRESS_694477] to report effectiveness and safety of Arista as a hemostatic agent in 
otolaryngology demonstrating its application in controlling postoperative bleeding after endoscopic sinus 
surgery.8  Zhang et al.  demonstrated success rate of 100% in the prevention of seromas in patients 
undergoing resection of malignant tumors in multiple locations, including the lower extremity.[ADDRESS_694478] 
savings.  The ALT free flap has been proven to be highly successful; however, optimal management of 
the donor site postoperatively is an area in need of additional gains via research.  Decreasing free flap 
donor site drain output and earlier drain removal could improve the quality of life of our patients, 
significantly decrease the cost of their care, and potentially decrease drain-associated infections.  If this 
study were to demonstrate Arista to reduce postoperative donor site drainage and seroma rates and/or a 
decrease in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534729], it could dramatically affect 
the way we take care of our patients. 
This study  seeks to critically evaluate current clinical practice paradigms to better understand the 
influence of Arista use in free flap donor sites.  A prospective, multi-institutional, randomized, controlled, 
single-blinded trial is the clearest methodology to evaluate the possible benefits of Arista.  Additionally, 
study in the ALT free flap alone, a single and commonly performed free flap, limits bias and confounding 
variables.  No clinical trial of this level has been performed on this topic; thus, our proposal is novel and 
the findings of the study are potentially important.
2.0 SUBJECTS  AND METHODS
2.1 Patient  Population and Enrollment
All adult  patients (18 years old and over) undergoing ALT reconstruction by [CONTACT_534733]-
trained Head and Neck Surgery faculty members at UCSF and a single microvascular-trained Head and 
Neck surgeon at Cleveland Clinic’s Head and Neck Institute will be included in enrollment for the study 
and consecutively registered. 
Exclusion criteria  will consist of patient age under 18, requirement of postoperative anticoagulant 
medications other than routine deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis (such as warfarin), and presence of 
clotting or bleeding disorder.   
Approval from  the intuitional review board (IRB) of both UCSF and Cleveland Clinic will be required prior 
to initiation of enrollment.  (IRB submission pending but expected in next several weeks.)  Patients 
eligible for inclusion in the IRB approved study will be approached for study enrollment.  Written consent

Research Proposalwill be discussed  with the patient by [CONTACT_534734]/or research assistants.  Further 
details are provided below (Section 3.0 Patient Selection). 
2.2 Study  Protocols and Surgical Description
If successfully enrolled  to the study, a randomized packet containing the patient’s research ID number will 
be pulled and included into the patient’s chart.  Randomization will be done at the initiation of the study by 
[CONTACT_40397] a randomization list with blocking and stratification by [CONTACT_7995].  An envelope containing the 
patients randomized group assignment will not be opened until the end of ALT free flap harvest just prior 
to closure.  
The patients will  be randomized to one of two groups.  Patients in Group [ADDRESS_694479] 5 grams of Arista 
applied diffusely to the wound bed before primary closure (Figure 3).  Per routine, a single [ADDRESS_694480] identical closure and drain management, except without the use of any Arista.  Patients 
in both treatment groups obtain routine deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with either weight-based 
subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin during the postoperative period.  All patients will receive 
standardized postoperative orders and care (Figure 4).

Specifically, the  physical exam will include:
1. Inspect  and palpate for presence fluctuance or fluid collection. 
2. Inspect  for color change, erythema or ecchymosis.
3. Inspect  the incision line. 
4. Palpate  for tenderness.
5. Strip  the drain and ensure that it is adequately functioning.
6. Re-application of Ace  wrap.
The drain will  only be removed per protocol, according to postoperative day and amount of recorded 24-
hour drainage output (Table 1).  Inpatient and outpatient drain management are outlined.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
patients remain as an inpatient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534730] (POD) 7-10.  The 
drain is not removed for the first [ADDRESS_694482] in the thigh at time of discharge, the patient is fully 
instructed on drain care, emptying, and recording.  The patient is then seen in the outpatient clinic, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_534731] 7-14 days after the surgery, the drain is removed regardless of output.

     POD >  7 Drain output ≤  60mL in previous 24 hours.
        On day  of discharge Drain output ≤  100mL in previous 24 hours.
Outpatient
     POD ≤  7 Drain may  be removed if output is ≤ 60mL in previous 24 hours.
     POD >  7 Drain is  removed regardless of output.
2.3 Primary  Endpoints and Outcomes 
The primary  outcome analyzed in this study will be total drain output (mL) in an effort to determine if the 
addition of Arista to the wound bed decreases overall wound drainage and drain output.  Given that drain 
output influences time of drain removal, assessment will be made to determine if timing of drain removal 
differs between groups.

CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN A  RESEARCH STUDY
Study Title:  Multi-Institutional Randomized Controlled Trial evaluating 
use of Arista Absorbable Surgical Hemostatic Powder in Anterolateral 
Thigh Donor Sites 
This is  a clinical trial, a type of research study.  Your study doctor(s), [CONTACT_534746], [CONTACT_534748], Dr. P. Daniel Knott, from the Department of Otolaryngology  will explain 
the clinical trial to you.
Clinical trials  include only people who choose to take part.  Please take your time to 
make your decision about participating.  You may discuss your decision with your family 
and friends and with your health care team.  If you have any questions, you may ask 
your study doctor.
You are  being asked to take part in this study because you have will be undergoing the 
type of reconstructive surgery we would like to study.
Why is  this study being done?
The purpose  of this study is to evaluate the effects, good and/or bad, of an absorbable 
product known as Arista in your leg site. 
Background: Many  patients undergo a similar leg surgery and it very common to place a 
small drain in your leg after the procedure is completed to drain any residual fluid. Arista 
is a plant based starch product used to try and reduce the amount of residual fluid that 
needs to be drained in effort to reduce total drain output and days needed with drain in 
place The drain comes out of a small hole in your skin and the nursing staff records the 
output. The timing of drain removal is often variable and depends on the amount of fluid 
recorded. This study will evaluate the potential benefit of arista on timing of drain 
removal.
How many  people will take part in this study?
Approximately 50  people will take part in this study.  
What will happen  if I take part in this research study?
Before you  begin the main part of the study...

During the  main part of the study...
You will  be "randomized" into one of the study groups described below.  
Randomization means that you are put into a group by [CONTACT_3364].  A computer 
program will place you in one of the groups.  Neither you nor your doctor can 
choose the group you will be in.  You will have an equal chance of being placed in 
any group.
oIf  you are in group 1: Arista will be used in your leg site
oIf  you are in group 2: Arista will not be used in your drain site
When you are  finished with your surgery:
You will  receive the same high quality care in everyway. The only difference will be the use of Arista 
in your leg wound. You will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_534736] a 
postoperative appointment.
Study  location: All study procedures will be done at UCSF

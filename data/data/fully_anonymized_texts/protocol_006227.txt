Protocol Title:   An Open -Label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long -Term Safety, 
Tolerability, and Biological Activity of ATYR1940 in Patients with Limb 
Girdle and Fascioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy
Protocol Number:  ATYR1940 -C-006 
Study Phase:  1b/2a 
Investigators /  Study 
Centers:  This is a multi -national, multi -center study being conducted at 
centers in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and Europe who participated in the 
Study ATYR1940 -C-003 (Stage 1 only) or ATYR1940 -C-004 (i.e., 
the parent stud ies). 
Study Objectives: The o bjectives of this study are to:  
Evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of long -
term treatment with intravenous (IV) ATYR1940 in patients
with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) or
fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) previo usly
enrolled in clinical study ATYR1940 -C-003 (Stage 1 only) or
ATYR -1940-C-004.
Explore the biological and pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of
ATYR1940 in patients with LGMD2B and FSHD, based on
changes in:
Serum -based muscle biomarkers.
Inflammatory immune  state in peripheral blood.
Muscle disease and muscle disease burden, based on skeletal
muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Skeletal muscle strength.
Upper and lower extremity muscle function.
Quality of life measures.
Study Design:  Study ATYR1940 -C-006 is a multi -national, multi -center, open -
label extension study designed to evaluate the long -term safety, 
effects on muscle, and PD of ATYR1940 in patient s with LGMD2B 
or FSHD previously treated in the Protocol ATYR1940 -C-003 
(Stage 1 only) or ATYR1940 -C-004 (i.e., the parent stud ies).  This 
study will be conducted at the same study centers at which patients 
were enrolled in the parent studies . 
Patients who completed the  treatment period in the  parent st udy; in 
the Investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], demonstrated acceptable tolerability of 
ATYR1940 , are considered by [CONTACT_256176]1940  and the study procedures , and do not meet any criterion

Version 1.0 (Original)  for ATYR1940  discontinuation are eligible for participation in the 
curren t study, contingent upon Investigator and patient agreement to 
continue ATYR1940  treatment.  
Ideally, when a patient transfers from the parent study to this 
extension study, the duration between the last ATYR1940 dose in 
the parent study and first ATYR1940  dose in this extension study is 
1 week ; however, a  maximum duration of 3 weeks is permissible .  
(A window >3 weeks may be permissible  on a case -by-case basis , if 
required due to administrative reasons, after consultation with the 
Medical Monitor. ) 
For the  first [ADDRESS_311284] tolerated dose received in the parent 
study ; no dose adjustments are allowed  during  this 12 -week period .  
After 12 weeks , if the patient is demonstrating good tolerabili ty, the 
ATYR1940 dose may be increased  on a patient -specific basis  at the 
Investigator ’s discretion , in consultation with the Sponsor and 
Medical Monitor.  ATYR1940 dose increases to >3.0  mg/kg are not 
permissible.   
All patients will receive ATYR1940 on a weekly basis in this study, 
regardless of the frequency of dosing in the parent study.   
ATYR1940 will be administered via IV infusion over 90 minutes.  If 
medically indicated , the infusion duration and volume may be 
adjusted at the Investigator ’s discretion in consultation with the 
Medical Monitor and Sponsor.

1 Week 1 in the current study (ESW1) is equivalent to Week 14 in the parent study (PSW14).  The Week 1 column in this table reflects assessments that are to be performed at 
ESW 1 (cells with heavy weight borders) in addition to those performed at PSW14 (cells with regular weight borders), as indicated in the parent study protocol.  All PSWeek 
14/ESWeek [ADDRESS_311287] ATYR1940 dose in the parent study (i.e., at Week 13) and the first ATYR1940 dose in the current study (at 
ESW1).  A window >3 weeks may be permissible on a case-by -case basis, if required due to administrative reasons, after consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
3 If there is >1 week (+3 days) between the last ATYR1940 dose in the parent study and the first ATYR1940 dose in the current study, the assessments indicated are to be 
repeated within 7 days before ESW1. 
4 For scheduling purposes, a ±3-day window is permissible around ATYR1940 infusion; however, each ATYR1940 dose must be separated by [CONTACT_2669] 5 days and no more 
than 9 days and only 1 dose may be administered within a given study week; if a patient’s scheduled visit day is changed in a given week (e.g., changed from Tuesday to 
Thursday), then subsequent weekly visits may be accordingly adjusted (e.g., Thursdays) or may revert back to the original schedule (e.g., Tuesdays), provided ATYR1940 is administered according to the timeframes specified. For the every 12-week and 6-month visits, a ±5-day window is permissible. 
5 Weight is to be re-measured any time the Investigator suspects the patient has experienced a notable change in weight (±10%) and the ATYR1940 dose recalculated.

Version 1.0 (Original)  2. INTRODUCTION
The rare muscle diseases with an immune component (RMIC) represent a group of rare 
autoimmune and genetic muscle conditions characterized by [CONTACT_256179].  RMIC encompass the more severe and grave forms of diseases, such as polymyositis, dermatomyositis, sporadic inclusion body myositis, immune necrotizing myopathy, Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD).  Many of the RMIC disorders are genetically-based and thus are defined and diagnosed by a combination of clinical signs and genetic analysis.  Patients with RMIC suffer from 
debilitating muscle weakness and experience significant morbidity and, in some diseases, 
an increased mortality compared to the general population.  As a group, RMIC are associated with tremendous patient suffering and constitute a high unmet medical need.

2.1. Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 
Limb girdle muscular dystrophies are a group  of uniformly progressive muscular 
dystrophies that share a common, but highly variable clinical presentation characterized 
predominantly by [CONTACT_256180], and 
usually sparing the face.  This group of disorders  is currently being re -classified based on 
profound advances in the molecular genetics underlying these diseases.  The various 
LGMD diseases are categorized by [CONTACT_256181], including those with dominantly  
inherited forms (i.e., LGMD1) and those wit h recessively -inherited forms (i.e., LGMD2).  
Within these categories, the diseases are further characterized by [CONTACT_256182].  Currently, LGMD is a collection of ~30 genetic muscle diseases caused by 
[CONTACT_256183] 50 genetic loci.3  Because of the heterogeneity of LGMD and the 
lack of diagnostic specificity, there are few reports on the prevalence of LGMD; 
however, it is estimated to range from 1:14,500 to 1:123,000, depending on the 
genetically defined form (Genetics Home Reference 2015).  The age of onset, severity, 
and features of LGMD vary among the subtypes.  Overall, LGMD affects men and 
women equally.   
LGMD2B is a recessively inherited dystrophy, often termed dysferlinopathy, since the causative mutations reside within the dysferlin gene ( DYSF).
[ADDRESS_311297] clinical phenotypes:  LGMD syndrome, with early weakness and atrophy of the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles in adolescence or young adulthood and with slow progression, and Miyoshi myopathy, with muscle weakness and atrophy in young adults, most marked in the distal parts of the legs, especially the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.  Over a period of years, the weakness and atrophy spread to the thighs and gluteal muscles.  The forearms may become mildly atrophic, with decrease in grip strength, but the small muscles of the hands are spared.  Two other phenotypes of LGMD2B that have been identified are less commonly seen, distal anterior compartment myopathy, a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_256148], with weakness of

Version 1.0 (Original)  the anterior tibialis muscles followed by [CONTACT_256184], and dysferlinopathy with rigid spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], which presents with lower limb weakness and atrophy in addition to contractures of the neck, chest, hip, and knee.
3  
Although cardiomyopathy occurs in some forms of LGMD, this feature is not commonly 
seen in  LGMD2B.  LGMD2B, representing ~5% of patients with autosomal recessive 
LGMD, is one of the most common forms in the [LOCATION_002] (US).5,[ADDRESS_311298] a predominant immune cell-mediated pathology.
8,9  
Patients with LGMD2B possess a dysregulated immune response, including cellular infiltration into affected muscle, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and altered cellular responses, including effects on myeloid cells.
10,11 Analysis of muscle 
biopsies from LGMD2B patients (including Myoshi myopathy, distal anterior compartment myopathy, and LGMD
12,13), has revealed that the most prominent cellular 
immunophenotype in LGMD muscle is infiltration with CD4 > CD8 positive T-cells, and macrophages, cell types that are modulated by [CONTACT_256185]1940 (see Section  2.3).  Cytokine 
patterns typi[INVESTIGATOR_256149]1 and M1 differentiation processes, including interleukin (IL)-1, interferon- , and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- .  These characteristics are also 
reflected in mouse models of LGMD2B in which the dysferlin gene is mutated, including 
the requirement for T and B cells in disease
8, as well as the expression of pro-
inflammatory cytokines.14  Further, inhibition of inflammatory cytokines results in 
reduction in disease in dysferlin-deficient mice.15,16  The muscle in patients with 
dysferlinopathy is characterized by [CONTACT_256186], and dysferlin-negative monocytes were shown to be aggressive and phagocytose more particles, suggesting that dysferlin deregulation in monocytes might contribute to disease progression.
10,13  
There currently is no pharmacologic treatment for the muscle disease in LGMD, 
including corticosteroids.17  Thus, symptomatic patients are managed with palliative and 
supportive care, typi[INVESTIGATOR_256150], occupational, and exercise therapy and with 
physical support (e.g., canes, walkers) as needed.  Investigation of gene therapi[INVESTIGATOR_256151]; however, the efficacy and

Version 1.0 (Original)  2.2. Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy 
FSHD is a rare, debilitating genetic myopathy.  The primary clinical phenotype of FSHD 
patients is progressive skeletal muscle weakness that develops in a descending, asynchronous pattern.
20,21  Weakness usually starts with muscles in the face and neck, 
and moves to the shoulder girdle, upper arms, trunk, and legs.  As weakness progresses, musculoskeletal deformities (e.g., scapular winging, hyperlordosis, and kyphoscoliosis) develop, and mobility becomes severely compromised.   
Inflammation as an early event and single muscle involvement has been proposed to play 
a role in FSHD pathophysiology.
22  The infiltrative inflammatory process includes 
invasion of CD4 and CD8 T cells, B lymphocytes and monocytes, particularly into skeletal muscles that are in the early stages of disease.
22  Once disease progresses in a 
particular muscle, weakness ensues and dystrophic changes, including necrosis, phagocytosis, regeneration, variation in fiber size, and proliferation of connective tissues with fatty infiltration/replacement, can eventually be seen.
[ADDRESS_311300] common genetic muscular dystrophy, FSHD is a rare disease, 
with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 15,000 to 20,000.21,24  FSHD typi[INVESTIGATOR_256153], and up to 20% of patients become wheelchair dependent after age 50.
[ADDRESS_311301] decade of life.  Classification of FSHD by [CONTACT_256187], although the nomenclature is variable.  Infantile onset FSHD, which comprises less than 5% of all cases of FSHD, has been classified as early onset FSHD, and a commonly cited definition for it – facial 
weakness prior to 5 years of age and shoulder girdle weakness prior to 10 years of age – was applied in a study by [CONTACT_256188]
[ADDRESS_311302] decade.
26  Although subclinical extramuscular manifestations of FSHD involving the eye 
(retinal vasculopathy, characterized by [CONTACT_256189], but without loss of vision) and ear (high frequency hearing 
loss) occur relatively frequently in patients with FSHD,

28 presents the potential 
for retinal detachment and vision loss, if uncorrected.  Therefore, auditory and ophthalmic screening and/or monitoring, and intervention, where feasible, are recommended in pediatric patients with infantile onset FSHD.

Version 1.0 (Original)  There is limited published literature describing other early onset patients with FSHD who 
do not meet criteria for the phenotype described by [CONTACT_256190].25, but who have 
symptom onset within approximately the first decade of life.  This group of patients may also be considered to have early onset FSHD, distinguished by [CONTACT_256191]; however, it is unclear if this group of early onset FSHD patients follows a clinical course similar to that classical ly reported in adults, or if there may be distinct phenotypes within 
this population.  
FSHD became a genetically defined muscular dystrophy with the discovery of the 
molecular genetics of FSHD1
29 and FSHD2.30  Over 90% of FSHD patients are 
considered to have FSHD1, a dominantly inherited disease that maps to variable sized deletions of a repeated microsatellite array ( D4Z4 ) in the sub-telomeric region of 
chromosome 4q35.  Normal, unaffected individuals have from [ADDRESS_311304] 
array repeats within this range (1-3) tend to have earlier-onset disease and more rapid disease progression.
31,32 
FSHD2, a second form that affects approximately 5% of patients, results from a mutation in the chromatin modulator gene, SMCHD1  on chromosome 18.  The inheritance pattern 
of FHSD2 can be considered “di-genic”, because as in FSHD1, a permissive 4q35 haplotype that generates a novel polyadenylation signal distal to the D4Z4  repeat array is 
required for disease penetrance.
30 
There is considerable variability in onset and disease progression in individuals with FSHD1 and 2.  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_256154] (interindividual differences in CpG methylation at D4Z4) for this basis has been recently uncovered.
33 
Since the identification of these genetic etiologies of FSHD, a primary focus on the pathogenesis of FSHD has been on the D4Z4  repeat.  This deoxyribonucleic acid 
sequence contains a copy of DUX4 , a transcription factor gene normally expressed in 
germ line development, but repressed in somatic tissue such as skeletal muscle.
34  It has 
been hypothesized that contracted D4Z4  repeat arrays in FSHD1, or specific SMCHD1 
mutations in FSHD2 set the stage for the FSHD phenotype by [CONTACT_9851] a “relaxed chromatin state” that results in somatic cell de-repression of DUX4  expression, 
particularly in skeletal muscle.
21,29,[ADDRESS_311305] been linked to the immunopathology observed in patients with FSHD.
36 
Although the genetic basis for the disease has been defined, and the pattern of muscle involvement in FSHD generally is predictable, the particular muscles involved are not.  For example, a single muscle in a limb or the trunk may be severely affected while for reasons that are unclear, an adjacent muscle will be either affected later in the disease course or spared completely.

Version 1.0 (Original)  Inflammatory and dystrophic disease processes can be followed in individual muscles 
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a methodology of increasing utility for monitoring the progression of muscular dystrophies.
22,37,38,39  The T1-weighted signal 
intensity by [CONTACT_256192], while the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) signal intensity suggests the presence of inflammation.  This increase in signal intensity is due to an increase in the T2 relaxation time, which can be measured using quantitative MRI.
38,40  A recent study with FSHD patients and controls found 
inflammation (CD8+ and CD4+ T cells), specifically in muscle biopsies taken from STIR hyperintense muscles.
[ADDRESS_311306] recently shown that 
inflammatory changes in FSHD skeletal muscle directly precede fatty infiltration.41  In 
addition, the degree of fatty infiltration as determined by [CONTACT_256193] T1-positive muscles has been correlated with a commonly used measure of functional status, the FSHD clinical severity score (CSS).
[ADDRESS_311307], in FSHD patients with muscle inflammation detected by [CONTACT_256194], activated immune cells (CD8+ T cells [pSTAT1+, T-bet+] and CD14+pSTAT1+ cells) are present in the circulation.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals with STIR 
positive muscle also show evidence of activation in cell culture by [CONTACT_256195]-10, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-12p40 
into the culture medium compared to controls.
22 
In other studies of the inflammatory immune state of FSHD patients, elevated levels of circulating immune proteins, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169], matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), creatine kinase-myocardial band, and tissue plasminogen activator, are seen in FSHD patients compared to control, unaffected individuals.
[ADDRESS_311308] been evaluated in FSHD in clinical studies, albeit without positive results.  These included the non-specific immunosuppressant, prednisone,
44 and molecules that are thought to 
enhance muscle mass:  beta adrenergic agonists,45 creatine monohydrate 
supplementation, and myostatin inhibitors.46  In these clinical studies, no clinically 
meaningful benefit was observed.  However, no effort was made to stratify the patients based on the degree of inflammation or specific muscle involvement.

Version 1.0 (Original)  Recent data in FSHD suggest that focusing on the inflammatory status of muscles in 
patients a priori  in a clinical study could increase the likelihood of seeing an impact of an 
immune modulator.22  
2.3. ATYR1940 
ATYR1940 is a protein therapeutic candidate identical to amino acids 2-506 of wild-type human histidyl tRNA synthetase (HARS).  ATYR1940 does not belong to any established therapeutic class.  ATYR1940 is a preservative-free liquid concentrate (4.0 mL) supplied at a concentration of approximately 25 mg/mL in a 5 mL single-use type 1 glass vial that is further diluted with 0.9% normal saline for intravenous ( IV) 
administration.   
Non-clinical studies in animals have shown that IV administered ATYR1940 is 
efficacious in various immune driven disease models in an active dose range of 1.0 to 
3.0 mg/kg, including normalization or reduction of severe statin-induced skeletal myopathy, as indicated by [CONTACT_256196] (decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, necrotic fib ers and fibrotic changes compared to control); decreased muscle 
protein levels in serum (e.g., decreased skeletal troponin I); decreased cellular infiltration (decreased CD68
+ cells by [CONTACT_9064] [IHC], decreased CD11b and CD14 
messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA; macrophage lineage]; decreased CD3+ cells by [CONTACT_4658], 
CD8a and CD8b mRNAs [T cells] and increased myeloperoxidasehigh by [CONTACT_4658] [neutrophil 
marker]); and decreased inflammatory marker levels in skeletal muscle tissues (e.g., decreased IL-6, MCP-1, and MMP-9).  These data support the role of HARS in modulating immune responses in skeletal muscle, and the potential of ATYR1940 to therapeutically suppress inflammatory cell infiltration (such as CD8+ cells) into skeletal muscles, thereby [CONTACT_256197], including pathologic serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) and other muscle proteins in patients with FSHD and other RMIC disorders.   
Nonclinical studies in immune cells isolated from the blood of healthy subjects have 
shown direct immune modulatory effects of ATYR1940, including attenuation of cytokines released from stimulated T cells and decreased spontaneous release of cytokines from M1 macrophages differentiated in the presence of ATYR1940. 
Clinical data with ATYR1940 are available from one completed study in healthy 
volunteers; limited clinical data are available from ongoing studies in patients with muscular dystrophies.   
The completed healthy volunteer study included [ADDRESS_311309] HARS (i.e., Jo-1 antibody [Ab]) exposed to a single IV dose of ATYR1940 in a Phase 1, first- in-human, randomized, double blind, place bo-controlled, 
single ascending dose study (ATYR1940-C-001).  In this study, ATYR1940 was investigated at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg.  Within each dose cohort, 6 subjects received ATYR1940 and 2 subjects received placebo.  A single, 30-minute IV infusion of

Version 1.0 (Original)  ATYR1940 0.1 to 3.0 mg/kg was safe and well tolerated by [CONTACT_256198].  All adverse 
events (AEs) were mild in severity, non-serious, and transient.  Overall, treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) reported for more than [ADDRESS_311310] to the occurrence of these AEs.  Furthermore, no clinically relevant changes from baseline in safety laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), pulmonary function tests (PFTs), or arterial oxygen saturation (based on pulse oximetry) were observed.  Six ATYR1940-treated subjects were determined to be anti-drug-antibody (ADA) positive at at least one post-dose time point; one of these subjects also was ADA positive at baseline.  ADA positivity 
was not associated with any temporal adverse systemic symptoms, safety laboratory 
abnormalities, or abnormal spi[INVESTIGATOR_256155].  Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ATYR1940 was not altered in these subjects. 
Results of PK analyses from Study ATYR1940-C-001 revealed evidence of systemic 
exposure to ATYR1940 in all treated subjects at all dose levels.  Following an approximate 30-minute IV infusion of ATYR1940, peak serum concentrations generally occurred at or shortly after the end of infusion, with a mean time to attain maximum 
serum concentration (t
max) of approximately 0.5 hours, followed by a mono-phasic 
decline.  Mean ATYR1940 exposure increased with increasing dose in a dose 
proportional manner.  Mean maximum serum concentration (C max) values increased 
approximately 24-fold over a 30-fold dose range, with mean C max values of 603, 1470, 
5480, and 14,700 ng/mL at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg, respectively.  Mean 
AUC 0-inf was 3050, 7090, 28,800, and 77,500 ng*h/mL at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 
3.0 mg/kg, respectively.  Mean total systemic clearance was low (ranging from approximately 0.6-0.8 mL/min/kg) and the volume of distribution was small (approximately 0.2 L/kg), resulting in a terminal half-life (t
1/2) of approximately 3-
6 hours across all dose levels.  No pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of ATYR1940 were observed in this single-dose healthy subject study.   
Limited data are available from the first clinical investigation of ATYR1940 in patients 
with FSHD, Study ATYR1940-C-002, “A Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Multiple 
Ascending Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and 
Biological Activity of ATYR1940 in Adult Patients with Molecularly Defined Genetic Muscular Dystrophies”.  This study is being conducted in adult patients with FSHD at multiple sites in Europe (EU) and the US.  In this study, patients are randomized (3:1) to receive ATYR1940 or placebo at doses of 0.3 or 1.0 for 4 weeks or 3.0 mg/kg for 12 weeks in sequential dose cohorts; qualified patients have the option to continue or initiate (i.e., in the case of patients randomized to the placebo group) ATYR1940 treatment in an ongoing extension study (ATYR1940-C-005).

Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, and Biological Activity ofATYR1940 in Patients with Limb Girdle and Facioscapulohumeral MuscularDystrophies”.  In both studies, which are being conducted in the US and EU, patientsreceive ATYR1940 for 12 weeks.  Patients who were enrolled in Study ATYR1940-C-004 or in Stage 1 of Study ATYR1940-C-003 and meet the entry criteria may participatein this extension study and continue treatment with weekly ATYR1940.  Pat ients may be
treated with ATYR1940 under this protocol until ATYR1940 is approved or itsdevelopment is discontinued, the study is closed by [CONTACT_1034], or a criterion for study
drug discontinuation is met (see Section 6.4.1 ).
2.4. Rationale for Current Study 
aTyr has shown that: 1) HARS is detected in blood samples from healthy individuals and 
patients (preclinical work) and in the ATYR1940-C-001 study in blood samples from healthy subjects participating in the study and 2) human skeletal muscle cells release HARS during differentiation, a process that can be regulated by [CONTACT_256199].  Furthermore, pharmacological application of ATYR1940 1) alters cytokine and other immune protein release from human primary immune cells, and 2) has immune modulatory activity in rodent models, including a rat model of myopathy.  Taken together, HARS is a 
physiologically relevant modifier of muscle cell biology, and the ATYR1940 nonclinical 
data suggest that it may have therapeutic effect in patients with inflammatory muscle diseases, including FSHD, by [CONTACT_256200]. 
LGMD2B and FSHD are chronic diseases that will likely require lifelong therapy.  In the 
parent studies, ATYR1940 is administered over a relatively short period of up to 12 weeks (including weekly dosing in the ATYR1940-C-003 study and weekly and twice weekly dosing in the ATYR1940-C004 study).  No maximum duration of therapy has been set in the current study, and patients will be allowed to receive treatment with ATYR1940 until ATYR1940 is approved or its development is discontinued, the study is

Version 1.0 (Original)  4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1. Overall Study Design and Plan
Study ATYR1940-C-006 is a multi-national, multi-center, open-label extension study 
designed to evaluate the long-term safety, effects on muscle, and PD  of ATYR1940 in 
patients with LGMD2B and FSHD previously treated in the parent studies.  This study will be conducted at the same study centers at which patients were enrolled in the parent studies. 
Patients who participated in and completed the treatment period in the parent study; in the 
Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], demonstrated acceptable tolerability of ATYR1940, are 
considered by [CONTACT_256201]1940 and the study procedures, and do not meet any criterion for ATYR1940 discontinuation are eligible for participation in the current study, contingent upon Investigator and patient agreement to continue ATYR1940 treatment.  
Ideally, when a patient transfers from the parent study to this extension study, the 
duration between the last ATYR1940 dose in the parent study and first ATYR1940 dose in this extension study is 1 week; however, a maximum duration of 3 weeks is permissible.  (A window >3 weeks may be permissible on a case- by-case basis, if 
required due to administrative reasons, after consultation with the Medical Monitor.) 
For the first [ADDRESS_311311] tolerated dose received in the parent study; no dose adjustments are allowed 
during this 12-week period.  After 12 weeks, if the patient is demonstrating good tolerability, the ATYR1940 dose may be increased on a patient-specific basis at the Investigator’s discretion, in consultation with the Sponsor and Medical Monitor.  ATYR1940 dose increases to >3.0 mg/kg are not permissible.   
All patients will receive ATYR1940 on a weekly basis in this study, regardless of the 
frequency of dosing in the parent study.   
ATYR1940 will be administered via IV infusion over 90 minutes.  If medically indicated, 
the infusion duration and volume may be adjusted at the Investigator’s discretion in consultation with the Medical Monitor and Sponsor. 
4.2. Justification for the Study Design 
ATYR1940 is being developed for rare, severe, muscle diseases with an immune component (i.e., RMIC), for which few, if any, efficacious treatment options exist, and no efficacious pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_256158].  Given the significant unmet medical need in these disorders, and in LGMD2B and FSHD, in particular, advancing safe and efficacious therapi[INVESTIGATOR_256159].   
The current study allows for patients who have demonstrated acceptable tolerability of 
ATYR1940 and who are candidates for continued treatment, in the Investigator’s

Version 1.0 (Original)  6. STUDY CONDUCT
6.1. Patient Identification, Enrollment, and Randomization
Patients will be identified by a unique, 5-digit identification (ID) number consisting of 
the parent study number (i.e., “3” or “4”), a 1-digit site number, and the 3-digit patient numbers assigned in the parent study.  For example, Patient  in parent study ATYR1940-C-[ADDRESS_311314] provide written informed consent or assent, as appropriate, based on 
local age of majority, before the performance of any study-related procedures.  Patient s 
who are determined to be eligible for the study will be enrolled into the study at the baseline visit (Week 1) and will receive IV infusions of ATYR1940 weekly.  Patients will attend posttreatment follow-up visits 1, 4, and 12 weeks following completion of dosing.  The 12-week follow-up visit is the End-of-Study (EOS) visit.  
6.3. Patient Adherence 
All patients are required to adhere to the protocol-specified dosing and visit schedules.  If a patient misses a scheduled visit, attempts should be made to reschedule the visit within the visit windows specified in Table 1.  Failure to attend scheduled study visits may result 
in discontinuation from the study. 
6.4. Withdrawal and Replacement of Patients 
6.4.1. Study Drug Discontinuation Criteria 
Study drug must be discontinued if any of the following events occur: 
Jo-1 Ab levels ≥1.5 U/mL.  Refer to Section 7.5.5  for complete details regarding the
management of potential immunogenicity.
Clinical evidence of a generalized IRR (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Refer to Section 7.5.5

Progression of disease that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], precludes furtherparticipation in the study.
Withdrawal of consent or assent.
Other findings that, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or Sponsor, indicate thatstudy drug administration should be discontinued.
All patients who have been dosed with any amount of ATYR1940 will continue to be followed for safety.  Patients who discontinue ATYR1940 dosing at any time during the treatment period should return to the study center for the 1-, 4-, and 12-week posttreatment follow-up visits and as clinically indicated. 
Patients who discontinue ATYR1940 due to a generalized IRR or Jo-1 Ab levels 
≥1.5 U/mL are to return to the study center for weekly visits as clinically indicated for safety follow up.  At a minimum, such patients must attend the 1-, 4-, and 12-week posttreatment follow-up visits (see Section 7.5.5).   
Patients who withdraw their consent or assent will not receive any further study drug, but will be offered all follow-up safety assessments.   
If a patient fails to attend scheduled study assessments, the Investigator must determine 
and document the reasons and the circumstances as completely and accurately as possible. 
6.4.2. Study Withdrawal Criteria 
Patients will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time 
for any reason, without prejudice to their medical care.  The Investigator also has the right to withdraw patients from the study for any of the following reasons: 
Patient non-adherence to ATYR1940 or protocol requirements.
Patient unwillingness to continue in the study.
Any other reason, based upon the medical judgment of the Investigator.
The reason for study withdrawal is to be documented in the patient’s source documents 
and electronic case report form (eCRF). 
At the time of discontinuation from the study, patients are to have all the assessments 
planned for the 1- and 4-week posttreatment follow-up visits performed within 7-days after the last study drug dose, if feasible.  (Note that some assessments  are listed in  both 
the 1- and 4-week follow-up visit; such assessments need only to be performed once at the time of discontinuation.)

aTyr or designee will supply ATYR1940 to the pharmacies at all participating study 
centers.   
7.1. Study Drug Supply 
ATYR1940 is a 505 amino acid protein identical to the wild-type amino acids 2-506 of human HARS.  ATYR1940 is formulated at a target concentration of 25 mg/mL as a sterile, non-pyrogenic solution in a formulation buffer containing histidine, sodium chloride, and polysorbate 20 at pH 7.3 and filled into type 1 borosilicate glass vials 
(5 mL) with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum seals.  The fill volume of the clinical 
trial material is [ADDRESS_311315] will dilute ATYR1940 in saline, based on each patient’s body weight, and transfer the dose to be administered to an infusion set. 
Study drug labels will not bear any statement that is false or misleading in any manner or 
represents that the ATYR1940 is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated.  The content of the labeling will be in accordance with local regulatory 
specifications and requirements.  
7.2.1. Procedures for Breaking the Blind 
This is an open-label study. 
7.3. Study Drug Storage 
ATYR1940 is to be stored in a locked area, accessible only to appropriate study 
personnel. 
ATYR1940 is to be stored in a freezer at -20C ± 5 C.  Prior to preparation for 
administration, ATYR1940 is to be thawed in the refrigerator for [ADDRESS_311316] before use and should not be 
placed at room temperature for more than 6 hours.   
ATYR1940 is for single-use administration and does not contain any preservatives or 
anti-microbial or bacteriostatic agents.   
7.4. Study Drug Accountability 
The Investigator or delegate will maintain accurate records of receipt and condition of ATYR1940, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will be kept of the date administered, quantity administered, and the patient to whom ATYR1940 was

Version 1.0 (Original)  administered.  Any reasons for departure from the protocol-specified dispensing regimen 
must also be recorded.   
The Investigator is responsible for the accountability of all used and unused ATYR1940 
vials.  The site ID number and patient initials are to be recorded on each ATYR1940 accountability log.  Each time study personnel dispense ATYR1940 for a patient, they are to record the date dispensed, amount dispensed, and their initials.  Study personnel are to monitor the inventory of clinical supplies and maintain a count of all used and unused supplies. 
A Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will review ATYR1940 acco untability records 
during routine monitoring visits.  At the completion of the study, there will be a final 
reconciliation of all ATYR1940 vials. 
7.5. Study Drug Dose and Administration 
7.5.1. Dose and Route of Administration 
ATYR1940 will be administered via IV infusion. 
For the first [ADDRESS_311317] tolerated dose received in the parent study; no dose adjustments are allowed during this 12-week period.  After 12 weeks, if the patient is demonstrating good tolerability, the ATYR1940 dose may be increased on a patient-specific basis at the 
Investigator’s discretion, in consultation with the Sponsor and Medical Monitor.  
ATYR1940 dose increases to >3.0 mg/kg are not permissible.   
All patients will receive ATYR1940 on a weekly basis in this study, regardless of the 
frequency of dosing in the parent study.   
7.5.2. Infusion Rate and Volume 
ATYR1940 will be administered IV as a 90-minute infusion.   The ATYR1940 dose will be prepared for infusion in 100 mL (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) or 
250 mL (3.0 mg/kg) saline, as long as clinically indicated; refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details.   
During the course of the study, the Investigator may confer with the Medical Monitor and 
Sponsor if medically indicated or if there does not appear to be an increased risk to the patient, to decrease the study drug infusion time and/or volume of study drug administration on an individual patient basis.  In such cases, the change(s) should be clearly documented in drug accountability records. 
Body weight obtained at Week 1 will be used for preparation of each patient’s mg/kg 
ATYR1940 dose.  If the patient has a notable change in body weight (±10%) during the study, the Medical Monitor is to be notified regarding recalculation of ATYR1940 dose.

Version 1.0 (Original)  7.5.3. Dosing Frequency and Treatment Intervals 
All patients will receive ATYR1940 weekly. 
Samples for determination of Jo-1 Ab levels will be collected before each ATYR1940 
dose; the Jo-1 Ab level from the previous dose will be used for the acceptability of dosing on each dosing day.  ATYR1940 is to be permanently discontinued for any patient with a Jo-1 Ab level ≥1.5 U/mL. 
7.5.4. Dose Reduction 
If, in the Investigator’s judgment, the patient is not tolerating a dose level, the Medical 
Monitor is to be contact[CONTACT_256202] a lower 
ATYR1940 dose level, or discontinuation of treatment (e.g., as would be the case for a generalized IRR), as appropriate. 
The Sponsor has the discretion to delay dosing, change infusion duration, or decrease a 
patient's dose, based on relevant data reviewed concurrently in an individual patient (e.g., Jo-1 Ab levels) and/or additional clinical information provided by [CONTACT_737]. 
7.5.5. Clinical Management Plan for Potential Immunogenicity 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Infusion-Related Reactions 
Generalized IRRs have been reported for 3 patients treated in studies of ATYR1940, 
including one event that was considered serious.  The constellation of symptoms in these 
patients has varied, but the overarching diagnosis is IRR of a generalized nature (i.e., not at the site of injection), which occurred during the infusion of ATYR1940, but only after the patient had received multiple doses of ATYR1940. The IRRs occurred in the setting of infusing ATYR1940 over 30-minutes in 50 mL of normal saline.  These reactions resolved after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256156], in some instances, administering medications and/or IV fluids. 
Thus, generalized IRR is a risk following the repeated administration of ATYR1940.  In 
an effort to mitigate this risk, the infusion duration and volume of infusion have been increased.  These changes are intended to decrease the concentration of ATYR1940 being infused at any given time and allow for medical assessment earlier in the course of an 
IRR by [CONTACT_1541] a wider window to stop the infusion before the entire dose has been 
administered. 
In addition, patients are to be closely monitored for a generalized IRR throughout the 
study drug infusion.  Signs and symptoms of a generalized IRR may vary among patients, and may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:   
Fever
Chills, rigors, myalgia
Facial or systemic erythema, pallor, facial swelling

Version 1.0 (Original)  Chest tightness, difficulty breathing, wheezing, stridor, tachypnea, bronchospasm,
cough
Tachycardia or significant pulse rate increase from baseline without other obvious
cause
Bradycardia or significant pulse rate decrease from baseline
Pre-syncope or syncope
Hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, or blood pressure swings, includinghypertension
Skin rash, urticaria, angioedema, or pruritus
Swelling of the throat, tongue, mouth, or lip
Difficulty speaking; hoarse or raspy voice
Excessive salivation; difficulty swallowing
Nausea, vomiting, cramps, or diarrhea
Development of a headache, especially moderate or greater, after start of infusion
A generalized IRR could be occurring when any symptoms suggestive of such a reaction begin during the study drug infusion or during the post-infusion observation period.  
While these symptoms may be self-limiting, such symptoms may signal the possibility of 
a severe reaction that could escalate into a life-threatening situation.   
In the event of a generalized IRR, study drug infusion must be stopped immediately (and not re-administered) and appropriate medical care must be given.  If necessary, the patient should be transferred to an acute care facility.  Once the patient is stabilized, additional blood samples are to be collected and procedures performed, as per Section [IP_ADDRESS].

from study participation. 
A very rare autoimmune disorder known as anti-synthetase syndrome, characterized 
clinically by [CONTACT_256203], skin manifestations, arthritis, and often associated with interstitial lung disease,

understood.

The diagnosis of an anti-synthetase syndrome is made based on a combination of clinical findings and Jo-1 Ab levels through commercially available serological assessments.

Anti-synthetase syndrome, once diagnosed, is usually treated by [CONTACT_256204], often by [CONTACT_256205].

The developm
ent of an anti-synthetase syndrome is a theoretical, albeit unlikely risk 
following the repeated administration of ATYR1940.  This risk, however, can be monitored closely, by [CONTACT_256206]-1 Ab levels.  With the commercial Jo-Ab assay used in this study, a level of 7 U/mL is 
thought to be the lower limit for an equivocal finding of Jo-1 Ab-associated anti-
synthetase syndrome and a level of 10 U/mL is considered positive.  The risk of a patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_256160]-[ADDRESS_311321] that ATYR1940 dosing will be discontinued if a Jo-1 Ab level of ≥1.5 U/mL is reached.

Version 1.0 (Original)  The actions listed below are to be taken by [CONTACT_256207] a Jo-
1 Ab result that reaches the threshold of ≥1.5 U/mL during the study.   
1) The patient will no longer receive ATYR1940, and
2) The patient will return to the study center for visits as per protocol, if feasible, and
be required to return to the clinical site for the 1-, 4-, and 12-week posttreatmentfollow-up visits, at a minimum.
In addition, any  patient who develops clinical manifestations of an anti-synthetase 
syndrome (with or without reaching a Jo-1 Ab threshold of ≥1.5 U/mL) will: 
1) No longer receive ATYR1940, if the clinical manifestations occur before
administration of any planned dose, and
2) Receive appropriate, acute medical treatment as warranted clinically, including
immunosuppressive interventions, and
3) Be referred to an appropriate medical professional (e.g., rheumatologist or
equivalent) who is experienced with anti-synthetase syndrome, and
4) Return to the study center for visits as per the protocol schedule, if feasible, but
must attend the 1-, 4-, and 12-week posttreatment follow-up visits, at a minimum.
The Medical Monitor will monitor patients’ Jo -[ADDRESS_311322] of the study, and will confer regarding any patient(s) with rising Jo-1 Ab titers.  The Medical Monitor and Investigator will discontinue ATYR1940 for patients whose Jo-1 Ab level reaches ≥1.5 U/mL.  The Investigator must inform the study Medical Monitor promptly regarding any patient who develops clinical manifestations of an anti-synthetase syndrome.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Anti-Drug Antibodies 
The development of humoral immune responses characterized by [CONTACT_256208].  ATYR1940 is a protein-based 
therapeutic, a truncated version of the human protein, HARS, which is 100% identical to the wild-type human sequence.  ADAs were observed following single-dose administration of ATYR1940 in nonclinical studies and when administered to healthy subjects.  The ADAs in humans occurred infrequently, titers were low, and the development of an ADA response was neither associated with any safety laboratory abnormalities nor temporal adverse systemic clinical symptoms.  These clinical data suggest that ADAs may be observed in the current clinical study.  The Sponsor has developed a sensitive assay to detect ADAs to ATYR1940, which will be utilized in this study.  Specifically, a ll patients will have repeated ADA assessments during the study

Version 1.0 (Original)  (see Table 1),  to monitor the presence or absence of ADAs, and measure titers, where 
present.  
For patients with elevated ADA at the 12-week F/U visit, additional ADA testing should 
be performed every [ADDRESS_311324] ATYR1940 as well as ADA neutralizing capacity. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Monitoring 
The development of clinically significant immunogenicity, including immediate 
hypersensitivity reactions, delayed hypersensitivity reactions, and immune complex 
deposition, is a potential safety concern for any biological drug candidate.  This study includes specific safety measures to monitor for this risk, and prospectively manage any potential adverse effects.  Clinical monitoring includes close observation for generalized IRRs during, or shortly after, IV infusions of ATYR1940, including vital signs, ECGs, pulse oximetry, and PFTs.  Frequent physical examinations with vital signs will be conducted during the course of the study to monitor for symptoms of potential generalized IRRs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Safety laboratory examinations will be 
performed at each visit, including serum chemistry evaluations and complete blood counts.  Blood samples to assess for signs of immunogenicity will be taken periodically (Table 1).  
Infusion of ATYR1940 will be discontinued in any patient who has symptoms of a generalized IRR (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Patients with evidence of a generalized IRR 
should have additional procedures and tests performed as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
7.5.6. Data Monitoring Board 
A Data Monitoring Board (DMB), consisting of at least 4 independent physicians and a 
statistician with expertise in clinical research, clinical immunology, and the clinical 
management of muscular dystrophies, has been assembled to review safety data and other pertinent data from all ongoing clinical studies of ATYR1940.  The ATYR1940 DMB will meet on a quarterly basis to review available, interim clinical safety and other pertinent data as defined for each protocol, from all patients enrolled in studies of 
ATYR1940, including this study. 
7.6. Rationale for the Dose(s) Selected 
For the first [ADDRESS_311325] tolerated dose received in the parent study; no dose adjustments are allowed during this 12-week period.  After 12 weeks, if the patient is demonstrating good tolerability, the ATYR1940 dose may be increased on a patient-specific basis at the Investigator’s discretion, in consultation with the Sponsor and Medical Monitor.  ATYR1940 dose increases to >3.0 mg/kg are not permissible.

Blood samples for measurement of C3a, C4a, C5a, Bb, and SC5b-9 in plasma and CH50, 
C3, C4 and tryptase in serum are to be collected according to the schedule defined in Table 1.  A central laboratory will be used for sample analysis.  Other products of complement may be tested as appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Antibody and HARS Measurements 
Blood samples for measurement of Jo-[ADDRESS_311336] ATYR1940 dose. 
For patients with elevated ADA at the 12-week F/U visit, additional ADA testing should 
be performed every 1 to 3 months until the level returns to the pre-infusion baseline. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Additional Laboratory Testing and Procedures in Patients with 
Generalized Infusion-Related Reactions 
Patients who experience generalized IRRs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) must have their infusion 
stopped and be treated as medically indicated.  Vital signs, pulse oximetry, and ECGs are to be performed to gather clinical information as soon as possible after the onset of clinical symptoms of a generalized IRR (for instance, immediately after cessation of the 
study drug infusion if such a reaction is seen).  Vital signs are to be monitored as 
medically indicated and pulse oximetry is to be monitored continuously for at least 2 hours after the end of infusion or until the patient has recovered, whichever is longer.  ECGs should be repeated as medically indicated. 
Once medical treatment of the IRR has begun, blood samples are to be obtained for 
assessment of: 
Plasma complement factors (C3a, C4a, C5a, Bb, and SC5b-9)
Serum complement (CH50, C3, and C4) and tryptase
Additionally, the following tests and procedures are to be performed 1.5 to 2 hours after the onset of symptoms: 
Samples for assessment of:
-Complete safety laboratory panel, including urine analysis and microscopy
(Section [IP_ADDRESS])
-Plasma complement factors (C3a, C4a, C5a, Bb, and SC5b-9)
-Serum complement (CH50, C3, and C4) and tryptase

8.5.10. Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Adverse Event 
An AE is defined in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice as “any untoward 
medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment” (ICH E6:1.2). 
Worsening of a pre-existing medical condition, (i.e., diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) 
is to be considered an AE if there is either an increase in severity, frequency, or duration of the condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes. 
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (i.e., elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before study enrollment are not considered AEs. 
In the case of death, only record “Fatal” for the event causing death.  AEs that are 
ongoing at the end of the study or time of death are to be noted as “continuing.”  Classification of AEs is to be done by [CONTACT_256216], version 4.03. 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual patient represents a significant change from baseline.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator’s judgment) should not be recorded as AEs; however, laboratory value changes requiring therapy or adjustment in prior therapy are considered AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  For the purposes of Investigational New Drug Application (IND) safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” and/or at least possibly related means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.

CONFIDENTIAL 63 
Version 1.0 (Original)  [IP_ADDRESS].3. Serious Adverse Event 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes :  
is fatal
is life-threatening (i.e., places the patient at immediate risk of death)
requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is an important medical event.  An important medical event is an event that may notresult in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256169], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize thepatient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of theoutcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs.  Examples of such medical events includeallergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or athome, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37349] “serious” is any inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256170] a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility.  Any AE 
that does not meet one of the definitions of serious (i.e., emergency room visit, out-patient surgery, or requires urgent investigation) may be considered by [CONTACT_139666] “important medical event” criterion for classification as an SAE. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Unexpected Adverse Event 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if an Investigator ’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the General Investigational Plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.   
[IP_ADDRESS].5. Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any event that meets all 
3 of the following definitions: 
1) suspected adverse reaction (Section [IP_ADDRESS].2);
2) serious (Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 ); and
3) unexpected (Section [IP_ADDRESS].4 ).

Version 1.0 (Original)  [IP_ADDRESS]. Follow-Up of Adverse Events 
The Investigator must continue to follow all SAEs and non-serious AEs considered to be 
at least possibly related to ATYR1940 either until resolution or the Investigator assesses them as chronic or stable.  This follow-up may extend after the end of the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Safety Information 
The Investigator must promptly report to his or her IRB/EC all unanticipated problems 
involving risks to patients.  This includes death from any cause and all SAEs reasonably or possibly associated with the use of ATYR1940 according to the IRB/EC’s procedures.  
The Sponsor will assess the severity and frequency of adverse drug reactions in adults 
versus pediatric patients, and will submit findings annually in the Development Safety Update Report/Annual Report. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Protocol Deviations Due to an Emergency or Adverse Event 
Departures from the protocol will be determined as allowable on a case- by-case basis and 
only in the event of an emergency.  The Investigator or other physician in attendance in 
such an emergency must contact [CONTACT_256221]. 
The Medical Monitor, in conjunction with the Investigator, will decide whether the 
patient should continue to participate in the study.  All protocol deviations and reasons 
for such deviations must be noted in the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy 
Pregnancies occurring while the patient is receiving ATYR1940 or within 30 days after 
the patient’s last dose of ATYR1940 will not be considered serious, but are to be reported using the same procedures as for SAEs described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
ATYR1940 must be discontinued immediately in the event of a pregnancy.  The patient should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
The Investigator will follow the patient until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify the Medical Monitor of the outcome within 5 days.  The Investigator will provide 
this information as a follow-up to the initial report. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE 
(i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), then the Investigator should report it as such.  Furthermore, all neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_311342] to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the ATYR1940 should also be reported.

9.1. Statistical Basis for Sample Size
No formal sample size calculation was performed; patients that participated in the parent 
study and meet the entry criteria for the current study may be enrolled.  Based on the design of the parent studies, it is estimated that up to 24 patients will be enrolled in this study. 
9.2. Statistical and Analytical Plan 
An overview of the statistical methodology to be employed is provided in the following 
subsections.  Details regarding the statistical methodology will be documented in a 
formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) prior to database lock.  The methodology for serum ATYR1940 concentrations and PD analyses will be documented in separate SAPs. 
9.2.1. General Methods 
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive in nature, since the goal of the study is to 
determine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ATYR1940.  This goal will be achieved by [CONTACT_109972] a deterministic algorithm; thus, statistical hypothesis testing is neither intended nor appropriate within this context.   
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum).  Categorical variables will be summarized 
showing the number and percentage (n, %) of patients within each classification. 
Data obtained from the parent study will be combined with data from the current study.  For patients assigned to ATYR1940 in the parent study, data obtained from the parent 
study will be combined with data from the current study.   
For patients who received ATYR1940 ≤4 weeks previously in the parent study, baseline 
refers to the baseline in the parent study (i.e., the most recent assessment obtained before the first study drug dose.)  For patients who received ATYR1940 >[ADDRESS_311343] 1 dose (partial or full) of ATYR1940 and have a 
postinfusion safety observation will be included in safety analyses.  Additional analysis populations will be defined in the SAP.

9.2.5. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
A summarization of demographic and baseline disease characteristic data, as documented 
in each parent study, will be presented for patients in this extension study.  Data to be 
tabulated will include at least demographic and baseline characteristics such as sex, age, 
race, height, weight, and body mass index, and disease-specific diagnostic and historical 
information.  Medical history also will be similarly summarized. 
9.2.6. Extent of Exposure 
Descriptive statistics will be presented overall and, if applicable, each dose level, for the 
number of doses received, percent of expected dose received, and actual dose received overall (i.e., across the parent and extension study), and in each the parent and extension study.  Furthermore, descriptive statistics for the number of doses missed or held will be presented, if warranted by [CONTACT_26739].  A tabular summary and listing of drug administration and dose intensity and a by-patient listing of the date and time of each ATYR1940 dose 
and the dose administered also will be presented.   
9.2.7. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Tabulations of prior and concomitant medications, coded using the World Health 
Organization drug dictionary, will be produced.  All prior and concomitant medications administered will be presented in a data listing.  
9.2.8. Safety Analysis 
9.2.9. Safety and Immunogenicity Analyses 
Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, type, and intensity of AEs, and 
changes from baseline in safety laboratory tests, ECG findings, vital signs measurements, PFTs, and pulse oximetry.  Immunogenicity will be assessed based on the incidence of infusion site reactions, ADA titers, changes in Jo-[ADDRESS_311344] follow-up safety data.  Tabulations will be presented for safety data overall and separately for the parent and extension studies. 
AEs will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) for purposes of summarization.  The overall incidence of AEs occurring during the study will be summarized by [CONTACT_14340].  The incidence of TEAEs also will be summarized by [CONTACT_256222], Inc.

Severe TEAEs, SAEs, and discontinuation rates of study therapy due to TEAEs also will be summarized.   
Events that are considered related to treatment (possibly, likely, or definitely drug-
related) will also be tabulated.  A tabulation will also be provided that enumerates TEAEs by [CONTACT_764].  Deaths, SAEs, and TEAEs resulting in study discontinuation will be tabulated, if warranted by [CONTACT_26739].   
All AEs occurring on study will be listed in by-patient data listings.  
Clinical laboratory parameters will be summarized across time points and changes from 
baseline will be summarized.  The frequency of clinically significant abnormal laboratory values will be tabulated.  Shift tables will be produced for selected laboratory parameters, including at least hemoglobin, WBC count, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, platelet count, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and electrolytes.  These tables will summarize the number of patients with each baseline CTCAE grade and changes to the maximum CTCAE grade on study. 
Changes in vital signs parameters (i.e., systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and body temperature) will be summarized across time points, and 
changes from baseline will be summarized.  Changes in ECG findings, PFTs, and pulse

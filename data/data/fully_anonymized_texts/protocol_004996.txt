Project Title:  A Mobile Tai Chi Platform for Fall Prevention and Cognition in Older Adults  
 
Version Date:  October 19th, [ADDRESS_1244914] 
include the targeting of executive function (EF). EF encompasses several essential higher 
cognitive skills, including attentional control, planning, response inhibition and working 
memory.1 In addition to portending Alzheimer’s disease,2–5 executive dysfunction in older adults 
is associated with impaired gait and balance and higher fall risk,6–11 which significantly decrease 
functional independence and overall quality of life (QOL).12 
 
Exercise is considered a promising intervention for preservation and restoration of cognitive 
function in older adults, including EF,13–[ADDRESS_1244915] advantages over unimodal  
interventions.17–19 Tai Chi (TC) is an increasingly popular multimodal mind -body exercise that 
incorporates physical, cognitive,  social, and meditative components within the same activity.20,21 
Recent  meta -analyses show that TC is a promising intervention for EF and global cognitive 
function in older adults. In several studies, TC was found to be superior to conventional 
exercise.22–24 
 
The CDC and many other agencies endorse TC. Yet surprisingly, a comprehensive 2014 national 
survey found that only 1.2% of the entire adult population reported using TC for health, 
suggesting potential limitations in access to training programs.[ADDRESS_1244916]  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_1244917] designing a future study to assess the clinical benefits of the Tele -
TC platform as a training system for elderly with mild cognitive impairments, we herein propose 
to assess:  
• If the system enables monitoring longitudinally of adherence, proficiency, and safety.  
• If the system is acceptable and user -friendly for its intended use in the home setting.  
• As an exploratory aim: if a [ADDRESS_1244918] the delivery of a novel Tele -Tai Chi (TC) intervention in a 
single -arm feasibility study for community -dwelling TC -naïve older adults with mild cogni tive 
impairment (N=20 total). We will assess feasibility and acceptability measures of the Tele -TC 
intervention and its specific components through both qualitative and quantitative feedback, as 
well as the systematic tracking of adherence data to inform fut ure trials and potential clinical use 
of the Tele -TC system. We  will also explore changes in clinically relevant outcome measures 
including cognitive function, physical activity, self -efficacy, quality of life, balance, gait, and 
evaluate changes in TC proficiency.   
 
 
Primary aims  
• Aim 1 : To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and 
safety of a novel home -based Tele -TC intervention 
by [CONTACT_849163], retention, adherence, and 
adverse events.  
o Hypothesis 1 : We will be able to recruit 20 
older adults with mild cognitive impairment 
and limit withdrawals to 20% or less.  
o Hypothesis 2 : Participants will complete 
>60% of recommended Tele -TC sessions.  
o Hypothesis 3 : Protocols for assessing safety 
can be developed and reliably administered, 
and preliminary evidence will support Tele -TC can be delivered safely.

Brigham approved database. When investigators with IRB approved protocols request assistance 
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_1244920] is deemed eligible, identifiable information (e.g. 
name, contact [CONTACT_2997]) will be collected, and an informed consent form will be emailed to subjects 
for review.  Baseline test ing at a future date will be scheduled.    
 
Eligible subjects will undergo the informed consent process in person, by [CONTACT_849166] a trained research assistant at the beginning of the baseline testing visit. Once 
consented, subjects will undergo baseline assessments (visit #1) in person using REDcap Survey. 
After baseline testing, subjects will participate i n the Tele -TC intervention, with recommended 
training sessions at least three times a week, along with two or more supplementary one -on-one 
live sessions (lasting upwards to 45  minutes) with TC instructors. TC proficiency using wearable 
sensors will be assessed at visit #1 baseline, at two follow -up assessments (visit #2 and visit #3) 
at approximately 4 and 8 weeks, and at a final assessment (visit #4) at 12 weeks. A semi -
structured qualitative interview will also be performed at visit #1 and #4.   
 
6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
Below, we provide a detailed description of the study procedures.  
 
1. Screening and Informed Consent (Visit #1A)  
 
Prior to beginning the consent process, study staff will ensure subjects’ eligibility using a brief 
questionnaire. This, in addition to the phone screening done as part of the recruitment process 
prior to the first visit, will ensure the eligibility of pro spective study volunteers. The phone 
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
  Page 6 of 15 screening is not only undertaken to allow researchers to confirm the subjects’ eligibility, but it is 
also an opportunity for the volunteer to ask any additional questions they might have regarding 
the study.  The phone screen includes administration of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA) -Blind, an adapted version of the original MoCA, a validated, rapid screening instrument 
for mild cognitive impairment . Informed consent will be obtained  by [CONTACT_889171]. Study staff will explain all the study procedures, equipment, and the risks associated 
with them as outlined in the informed consent form (ICF). The devices will be provided  to the 
subjects after consent.  
 
 
 
 
Subjects will be provided among others with two  mobile devices and requisite chargers, a tablet 
travel stand, tripod, two GeneActiv watches, [ADDRESS_1244921] with 
the developed TC app and the other will be used an extra mobile device  and stand for virtual 
visits and video recording.

2. Assessments (Visits #1B, #2, #3 and #4)  
 
At Visit  #1B, subjects will be instructed in how to use the tablet -based Tele -TC program. The 
mobile devices and the sensors will be provided to each participant and will be preprogramed 
will all required software. It is worth emphasizing that, as part of the consent process, all subjects 
will be asked permission to be videorecorded during the assessments via Zoom Enterprise.  
 
Visits will be divided into two components: 1) clinical assessments and 2) instrumented 
monitoring of TC performance .  
 
The following clinical assessments will be performed during Visits #1B and #4 . 
 
The following questionnaires will be provided to the subjects through REDcap Survey with an 
email link. It will take around 45 minutes to complete all of the questionnaires.  
• Activities Specific Balance Confidence (ABC): 16-item self -report measure in which 
patients rate their balance confidence for performing activities.  
• PROMIS® (Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) 29 ( PROMIS -
29) instrument: 29-item questionnaire assessing each of the following domains: anxiety, 
depression, fatigue, physical function, pain interference, pain intensity, sleep disturbance, 
and ability to participate in social roles and activities. The instrument contains four items 
from each primary domain plus a single pain intensity rating.  
• Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE): self-reported level of physical activity in 
individuals aged 65 years or older during the previous 7 days.  
• Exercise Self -efficacy Questionnaire (SEE): A 9-item questionnaire that focuses on the self -
efficacy expectations for exercise for older adults; specifically, the ability to continue to 
exercise despi[INVESTIGATOR_493882].  
 
Clinical assessments which take around 15 minutes will include tests such as:  
• Trail Making Test A/B: Executive function will be assessed using the Trail Making Test . 
Participants will be timed while sequentially connecting a series of numbered circles (part 
A), as well as connecting an alternating series of numbers and letters (part B). The 
adjusted trail making score (i.e., part B minus A, sec) is sensitive to changes in executive 
function and frontal lobe pathology in older adults.  The tr ail making Test will be camera -
recorded.  
• Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT): examines working memory span. 
COWAT requires the participant to produce as many words as possible that begin with a 
given letter of the alphabet (F,A,S). There is [ADDRESS_1244922] will be audio -recorded and transcribed to ensure accurate 
collection of subjects’ verbal responses.  
• Digit Span Test:  widely used measure of short -term memory, i.e. the number of digits a 
person can absorb and recall in correct serial order. Two trials of eight number sequences 
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_1244923] being nine digits. Scores are based on the number of 
sequences correctly recalled (i.e., until the participant consecutively fails tw o trials of the 
same digit span length). BDS has good reliability and validity.  
• Grip Strength: we will measure the grip strength of both upper lim bs using  a hand grip 
dynamometer. We will repeat the measure three times.  
• Instrumented and camera -recorded monitoring of balance in each leg separately : Subjects 
will be asked to stand on one leg for 30 seconds.   
• Instrumented and camera -recorded Timed -Up-and-Go: Subjects will be asked to stand up 
from a chair, walk at their normal speed around a cone, turn around, and come back to 
sit in the chair.  
• Instrumented and camera -recorded Timed -Up-and-Go dual task: Subjects will be asked to 
complete the previous task while counting backwards by [CONTACT_14774].   
• Instrumented  and camera -recorded  Sit-to-Stand: Subjects will be asked to stand up from 
a chair while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_849159] 30 seconds.  
•  Instrumented and camera -recorded monitoring of balance in both legs with feet 
shoulder -width apart and as close as possible without touching.  
• Instrumented and camera -recorded monitoring of gait : Subjects will be asked to walk back 
and forth for 2 minutes.  
• Instrumented and camera -recorded monitoring the miniBEST: It is a shortened version of 
the Balance Evaluation System Test (BESTest). It is a [ADDRESS_1244924] scored on a 3 -level 
ordinal scale. It aims to target and identify different balance control systems.  
 
Instrumented and camera -recorded monitoring of TC performance will be performed during 
Visits #1B, #2, #3 and #4 :  
• Participants will be instrumented with 5 sensors (one on each limb and one on the trunk) 
and they will be following the instructions from the Tele -TC platform.  
 
Study staff will use Zoom to communicate with subjects during the visits done remotely. The 
performance of TC exercises will also be videorecorded and scored using the proficiency metric 
described in our preliminary studies section to provide a gold standa rd. We will try to use the 
sensors during the remote visits, but if it is not possible, we will document the reasons and 
continue the TC exercises only with video.  
 
Subjects will be asked to don one Smart GeneActiv watch by [CONTACT_849169]* on their wrist to 
monitor activity during approximately a week  after visits #1B and a week before visit #4. 
 
We will ask the participants to send the GeneActiv back to the lab after wearing it. We will be 
sending another GeneActiv about two weeks before visit #[ADDRESS_1244925]

3. TC Training Sessions the Tele -TC Platform (12 weeks)  
 
Study volunteers will participate in a [ADDRESS_1244926] used in 
multiple prior clinical studies. In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the intervention will be delivered via our 
platform -based application. All participants will be provided with a tablet with the Tele -TC 
software installed. The structured intervention , designed for older adults, emphasizes essential 
TC movements that are easily comprehensible and can be performed repetitively in a flowing 
manner. The protocol includes up to six core TC movements based on the traditional Cheng Man -
Ch'ing's Yang -style sh ort form. Additionally, a complementary set of traditional TC warm -up 
exercises that focus on loosening the physical body, incorporating mindfulness and imagery into 
movement, promoting overall relaxation, and coordinating breathing awareness are included.  
Chairs are used in the protocol for a subset of seated warm -up exercises, as well as for stability 
and rest as needed. Participants will be asked to practice the protocol (45 -60 min) at home for at 
least [ADDRESS_1244927]’s participation in the intervention study. Falls will be 
defined as any event in which the participant unintentionally comes to rest on the ground or 
other lower level, not as a result of a major intrinsic event or an overwhelmingly external hazard. 
Falls will be systematically monitored in two ways. As part of our safety and adverse events (AE) 
monitoring, participants will be asked to complete a weekly REDcap adverse events survey about 
their TC practice and activi ties of daily living. Study staff will follow -up by [CONTACT_889172]. During study visits #1b -#4, study personnel will inquire about and record 
characteristics and details of falls and other adverse events.  
 
5. Feedback from the Subjects  
 
During the last visit (visit #4), we will conduct a semi -structured qualitative interview to gather 
feedback from the subjects regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the study overall, and 
more specifically the usability of the Tele -TC platform. We  will ask them to provide us with 
feedback regarding general characteristics of the platform, possible improvements of the system, 
and whether they would consider using the system on a daily basis at home. The qualitative 
interview will be audio recorded. In addition, at the end of the study, we will use an adapted 
version of the System Usability Scale (SUS).  
  
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
  Page 10 of 15 6. Return of devices  
 
The subjects will be asked to return the devices (mobile devices, sensors, tablet stands) during 
visit#4 . The final payment for the study ($ 70) will be contingent on the return of the study 
equipment.  
 
7. Data variables analysis to be collected  
 
The primary outcomes of the study are the retention and the protocol adherence during the 
study, and the System Usability Scale collected post -intervention.  
The exploratory outcomes will include the following:  
- The ease of use of the Tele -Tai Chi platform measure with the qualitative interview 
collected post intervention.  
- The changes in outcomes collected at baseline and post -intervention: the Activities -
specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scores, PROMIS 29 scores, the Physical Activity Scale 
for the Elderly (PASE), the Trail Making Test A/B scores, Self -Efficacy Exercise (SEE) scores, 
the grip strength, the Controlled Oral Word Association Test  (COWAT), the Digit Span 
Test, the Timed -Up-and-Go, the Timed -Up-and-Go dual task single leg stance, the Sit -to-
Stand performance, the balance on both legs with feet shoulder -width ap art, the  balance 
on both legs with feet close to each other, the normalized -to-height stride length and 
stride time variability, the activity level, and the Mini -Balance Evaluation Systems Test 
(MiniBEST) collected only in individuals who are willing to b e tested in the MAL .  
- The changes in The Tai Chi proficiency scores collected at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 
and pos t-intervention.  
 
8. Remuneration  
 
Subjects will be compensated based on the procedures undertaken. Subjects will receive up to 
$240. The compensation amount will be as follows:  
• Virtual visits: $50 for  each  follow -up testing session (4 -week, 8 -week) for a total of $100  
• In-person visits: $[ADDRESS_1244928] -intervention testing session for a total of $140  
If during the study the study staff determines that the participant cannot safely complete the 
session, he/she will be asked to stop – but he/she will still receive $35 for their time and effort.  
 
Additionally, associated travel fees accrued by [CONTACT_889173] (e.g. parking 
fees at SRH) will be covered by [CONTACT_889174].  
 
 
7. Risks and Discomforts  
 
TC is likely to be safe, as there have been no reports of serious adverse impacts in the TC 
literature. We experienced no serious adverse events in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_849160], heart 
failure, vestibulopathy, and osteopenic populations. However, there may b e some potential 
expected risks to participants including the following:  
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_1244929] 
stop and will be advised to seek medical care if appropriate.  
 
Subjects will be told that the study procedures may be associated with discomfort due to wearing 
the sensors and by [CONTACT_29429]/muscle soreness. In case subjects experience discomfort or excessive 
fatigue, they will be free to remove the sensors and end their participation in the study.  
 
Unintentional loss/disclosure of Protected Health Information may occur and is considered a 
minimal risk due to the security measures enforced at SRH. Confidential information will be kept 
in a locked filing cabinet, on REDcap, and on password -protected co mputers in the MAL.

system  for older adults with mild cognitive impairments.  
 
10.   Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
 
Because this study’s procedures pose minimal risk to the subjects, bimonthly data and procedural 
reviews by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_889168]. Any safety concerns about the equipment or testing protocol will be 
brought to the immediate attention of [CONTACT_276566]. S tudy staff will conduct bimonthly audits to 
ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for study documentation.  
 
Approval of protocol, informed consent procedures, and recruitment will be obtained from the 
IRB during annual reviews.  
 
Adverse event reporting will be done according to Partners Human Research Policy. Remedial 
action to prevent reoccurrence of the event will be instituted prior to the resumption of study 
procedures.  
 
Study staff will conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance with regulatory standards for study 
documentation.

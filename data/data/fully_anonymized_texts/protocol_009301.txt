1 Study Summary
The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) began collecting
data for the PECARN Core Data Project (PCDP) in 2002, using administrative data from
all PECARN hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. This project now has nearly [ADDRESS_238957] from the (largely paper based) medical record on a large scale.
In 2011, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) funded a grant
to create a medical record registry by [CONTACT_200347]
(EHR) at four PECARN hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200320] aliates (R01HS020270). Technology was
developed to extract data for all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits, accomplish
substantial deidentication of the extract prior to transmission to the Data Coordinating
Center (DCC), and produce a data warehouse registry to use for quality improvement
and research. At the present time, this medical record registry includes 1.9 million visits
with over 800,000 dierent patients, and performance report cards are provided to all
participating providers on a monthly basis.
This protocol (PECARN Protocol Number 36) continues the registry as the \PECARN
Electronic Medical Record Registry (PECARN Medical Record Registry)" and will replace
PECARN Protocol Number 30, entitled \Improving the Quality of Pediatric Emergency
Care Using an Electronic Medical Record Registry and Clinician Feedback (PECARN
Emergency Care Registry)". All data from the PECARN Emergency Care Registry will
be incorporated into the PECARN Medical Record Registry.
1.1 Study Objectives
This study has the following objectives:
Objective 1. Continue the PECARN electronic medical record registry for pediatric
patients by [CONTACT_200348] (EHR) clinical data from participating
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200321] (ED) for quality improvement purposes and to
plan future research.
Objective 2. Continue to use the emergency care visit registry to analyze and describe
processes of care and outcomes for injuries and illnesses of patients presenting to

participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200322].
Objective 3. Continue preparation and dissemination of clinical performance report
cards to assess quality improvement initiatives.
2 Background
Children account for over one quarter of the 114 million annual emergency department
(ED) visits in the US,1,2yet the needs of children in the ED have received relatively
small attention.3Recently, there has been increased attention to the unique needs of
children during emergencies. Among the areas in need of evaluation are the eectiveness
and quality of emergency care, outcomes of dierent congurations of EMSC, optimal
resource allocation and utilization, and cost-eectiveness of EMSC and its components.4
There has also been documentation of signicant variation in the quality of care provided
to children in EDs,5{11as well as recognition of racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare
delivery.12The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) was
established in 2001 to address these needs and improve the quality of emergency care for
children through the performance of rigorous research.13,14
The network's rst project was to design and implement an administrative database of
all emergency department visits in PECARN hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], the PECARN Core Data Project
(PCDP).15The PCDP, which has been ongoing with Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approval at every PECARN hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200323] 2002, uses data from billing and registration
systems at all participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], as well as electronic health record data from some
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. The PCDP currently has nearly [ADDRESS_238958] has been successful in providing basic demographic and injury or illness infor-
mation,15{18evaluation of methodology,19,20developi[INVESTIGATOR_200324],21,22and providing limited benchmarking information.16{18, [ADDRESS_238959] of patients treated for status asthmaticus received potentially un-
necessary ancillary testing and the risk for this testing was higher in children cared for
at non-children's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200325] 1.00

emergency medicine.10
This early experience led to funding from AHRQ (RO1HS020270) to build a medical
record registry, leveraging the availability of electronic health records (EHR) in selected
PECARN sites. The PECARN Emergency Care Registry has detailed information about
all children seen in the EDs in four PECARN hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200326].
The EHR vendors include Epic and Cerner. The Registry information from January 2012
through April 2016 is summarized in Table 1.
Encounters 1,943,607
Patients 819,665
Diagnoses 5,960,989
Lab Results 12,005,884
Medication Orders 2,542,557
Radiology Tests 685,515
Narrative Documents 12,226,548
Table 1: Summary of PECARN Registry as of April 2016.
The Registry provides a unique resource for understanding and improving pediatric
emergency care. The Registry has been used to create performance report cards for
participating sites as part of a quality improvement initiative, and to explore processes
of care associated with specic disorders, such as asthma, long bone fractures, and viral
infections. This has enabled measurements to determine the eectiveness of specic quality
improvement initiatives for these conditions. The narratives (over 12 million) provide a
valuable corpus upon which to improve natural language processing methods, critical to
deriving meaningful research results from EHRs over the next decade. Continuing the
Registry per the present protocol will increase the value of this resource, as additional
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200327], which will increase the generalizability of knowledge
based on the Registry. Finally, the Registry will provide a structure for development of
future research endeavors.

will be added to the original sites, with the goal of including all PECARN centers that
have an accessible EHR. The project is anticipated to continue for at least ve years,
subject to annual Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval.
[ADDRESS_238961] all EHR information into the Registry.
For example, if a laboratory value is incorrectly entered, and then corrected, both values
are retained in the EHR for legal auditing purposes. The Registry will only receive the
value nal at the time of data transmission. The following data domains are extracted
from the EHR for inclusion in the Registry:
Demographic Data. For example, but not limited to: site of care, insurance type, race,
ethnicity, birthdate (age).
Clinician Data. For example, but not limited to: independent licensed provider.
Date and Time Data. For example, but not limited to: all date and time values relating
to the ED or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186], as well as date and times of all events or ndings.
Diagnoses and Procedures. For example, but not limited to: all available diagnoses
codes, procedure codes, cause of injury codes, including ICD9 (when still available),
ICD10, and CPT.
Review of Systems. For example, but not limited to: review of physical systems as
recorded in specic elds, if available. Otherwise derived from narrative text data.
History of Illness. For example, but not limited to: history of illness as recorded in
specic elds, if available. Otherwise derived from narrative text data.
Physical Examination. For example, but not limited to: physical examination ndings
(including weight) and clinical scores (e.g. pain score, asthma scores, GCS scores)
as recorded in specic elds, if available, or in narrative text.
Laboratory Testing Data. For example, but not limited to: all laboratory tests sent
during the ED visit, including results that may be returned after the ED visit is
concluded.

Medications. All medications reported as home medications, ordered or administered
in the ED, or ordered as discharge prescriptions, including dosage information.
Treatment Data. For example, but not limited to: radiology orders, EKG orders,
respi[INVESTIGATOR_200328].
Vital Sign Data. All vital signs as recorded in specic elds, if available. Otherwise
derived from narrative text data.
Narrative Text Data. All available narrative data related to the ED visit, including
potentially delayed radiologic dictation reports. Narrative or free text notes may be
created by [CONTACT_13922], nurses, or other clinicians, and the author of each narrative
will also be extracted.
ED Admission and Discharge Data. For example, but not limited to: Reason for
visit, chief complaint, triage category, mode of arrival, urgency, use of an interpreter,
discharge location, vital status.
Inpatient Admission and Discharge Data. For ED visits resulting in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200329]-
mission at the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the date and time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], vital status
at discharge, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458].
4.2 Adding Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200330], the De-identication Procedures described
in Section 4.4and Data Submission procedures described in Section 4.3are already
optimized. For new hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], it is necessary to tailor these procedures to the specic
EHR vendor and to optimize the de-identication algorithm for the specic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200331]. The steps required include the following general stages:
1.Identify potential sources of relevant data elements in the specic EHR at each site.
2. Finalize the types of data elements that will be extracted.
3. Extract data for one day of data at each clinical site.
4. Transmit one day identied data to the DCC for de-identication.
5. Establish de-identication procedure at each clinical site.
6.Extract and de-identify the same one day sample to verify that de-identication at
site works.
7. If site de-identication does not work, revise process and iterate until successful.

8.Extract and de-identify at least two one-month data sets from between the rst
month of the previous [ADDRESS_238962], de-identify, and transmit entire previous 12 months (rolling) data from
each site to the DCC.
13. Integrate previous 12 month data (rolling) into existing Registry.
4.3 Database Extraction and Submission
Available data will be extracted from each site's EHR in an automated fashion that is
vendor-specic, and is likely to be installation specic (i.e. two dierent sites may have
the same vendor but dierent preferred extraction methods depending on the vendor
features that were purchased or updated). Currently the nal extraction format is plain
text formatted with extensive markup language (XML) tags. The XML format enables au-
tomatic validation of the extracted le. After de-identication procedures are established
at each site (Section 4.4 on the next page), these are applied to the extracted informa-
tion prior to encrypted transmission to the DCC and importing into the Registry database.
The precise manner of database extraction, XML formatting of variables, and technical
details of the steps required to accomplish this task are described here for information
purposes. The technical approach is likely to evolve in the future, and may be altered
without revising this protocol document.
Data that are not available at the time of data transfer, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_200332]

Protocol Version Date: September 9, 2016
The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network
Protocol 036 (Alpern) Page [ADDRESS_238964] after the de-identication procedure is carried out: the
site identication, the clinician identication, the month of the visit, and a one-way hash
encryption of the medical record number. The rst three data elements are needed in
order to provide feedback for specic months to specic sites and clinicians. The hash
encryption value of the medical record number is required to identify repeat visits by
[CONTACT_200349], enabling longitudinal study of selected pediatric illnesses and injuries
seen in the ED setting. Other patient-related identiers are eectively removed by [CONTACT_200350]-
identication procedure (Fscore 98% to 99%, which is superior to manual de-identication
by [CONTACT_1978]).
The precise technology to be employed may be changed as this project moves forward
to re
ect improvements in available tools, without revision of this protocol. The purpose
of this section is not to constrain the use of state-of-the-art technologies, but rather to
describe the principles by [CONTACT_200351]. For current sites in
the Registry, we will continue the current methods for de-identication. For new sites, it
is necessary to nalize and verify the eectiveness of the de-identication for each specic
site. In order to accomplish this, the DCC will have access to fully identied records from
each new site from a single day from the 12 months previous to implementation, the DCC
will de-identify the data, and verify that the de-identication was fully accomplished.
The process will then be implemented at each site and we will conrm that the process
was eective (for the same day of patient data). After the de-identication procedures
have been conrmed, all identiable records that are at the DCC will be removed from
production servers and will not be incorporated into the Registry.
The de-identication is done with software (De-Id) that was developed by [CONTACT_200352]25to produce a de-identied public use intensive care database.26The DCC
has developed a software platform that includes De-Id as well as XML verication software.
After the initial de-identication process has been veried, this software will be installed
at each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], so that the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200333] (XML verication) and
execute the de-identication software on its own servers within its own rewall, prior to
encrypted transmission of the de-identied data to the DCC.

4.4.1 General Algorithm
The software (De-Id) is a program script that uses multiple dictionaries to identify and
remove names and locations from text. A list of known patient names (at an individual
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) can be the rst dictionary used at the site by [CONTACT_200353], and this will remove
patient names. The software then uses large dictionaries of rst and last names to identify
other potential names, such as relatives, nurses, doctors, or other clinicians. A similar
approach is used for locations | namely, a list of locations that are relevant to each
clinical site will be used as a location dictionary, and locations will be removed.
Dates and times present an interesting problem because it is necessary to preserve time
intervals and patient ages. The software will remove all dates and replace them with a
random patient-specic oset. This shifted date preserves the day of the week and the
season to prevent confusion due to free text phrases such as \next Wednesday". The
patient's date of birth is treated in the same manner, so that the correct age can be
calculated from the replaced dates. The random shift is patient specic and will be
consistent for the entire individual patient record and between subsequent visits for that
patient.
In order to preserve the month in which the data were submitted, the clinician identica-
tion,and site identication, separate database elds will be added to each record when
the le is sent to the DCC, so that month-specic feedback can be provided to sites and
providers, as already described.
Other identiers include telephone and fax numbers, Social Security numbers, medical
record numbers or other numeric identiers. The software will remove these throughout.
The medical record number will be one-way hash encrypted to allow identication of
repeat visits for patients.

The performance report cards contain 20 to 30 pages of tabular and graphic data; examples
are provided in this section to illustrate the type of content in the reports. Performance
report cards are prepared on a monthly basis for each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Figure 1 on the following
page) as well as for clinicians within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Figure 2 on page 17). In order to
make the data more easily interpretable, the report cards also include graphic displays
for each measure that include trend over time charts at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172882] (Figure 3 on
page 18) and clinician level (Figure 4 on page 18). Each of these reports includes relevant
comparisons as well as the Achievable Benchmarks of Care (ABC)27derived from the
previous CY data. The ABC serves as the target for performance improvement.

assess improved eciency as technology evolves. For example, measures will include (but
are not limited to) the following:
Total time to generate the data upload for each site
Total time spent by [CONTACT_200358]
Number of discrete variables and free text (narrative) elds
Proportion of missing data for each variable
Proportion of impossible or nonsensical data for each variable
Proportion of outlier (out of range) data for each variable
Objective 2. Continue to use the emergency care visit registry to analyze and describe
processes of care and outcomes for injuries and illnesses of patients presenting to
participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200322].
Appropriate descriptive statistics and multivariable modeling methods will be used to
carry out this objective.
Objective 3. Continue preparation and dissemination of clinical performance report
cards to assess quality improvement initiatives.
Report card specic data extracts are created on a monthly basis, and the report
cards are generated on a monthly basis. The precise contents of the report cards may be
adjusted in accordance with the specic quality improvement initiatives that are being
undertaken by [CONTACT_171794], but will be similar to existing report cards. The reports
are generated using SAS and R software.
6 Data Management
6.1 Data Coordinating Center
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) in the Department of Pediatrics at the University
of Utah School of Medicine provides data coordination and management services for a
variety of national research networks. Anchoring these services is a state-of-the-art, energy
ecient data center completed in 2013. The data center facility supports more than 1200
users around the world and provides a secure, reliable, enterprise-wide infrastructure
for delivering critical DCC systems and services. The data center was built using high
industry standards and energy ecient cooling solutions. The data center is cooled by
[CONTACT_184454]'s LCP inline cooling technology, providing eciency, redundancy and modularity.
Cooling is based upon a hot/cold aisle design that allows for even air distribution with
PECARN Medical Record Registry Protocol Version 1.00
Protocol Version Date: September 9, 2016
The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network
Page 20 of 32 Protocol 036 (Alpern)
minimal hot spots. The data center electrical power system contains a redundant Mit-
subishi uninterruptible power system (UPS) with a diesel backup generator. The data
center is protected with a FM200 re suppression system, early warning smoke detectors
and a heat detection warning system to act as a secondary system to the smoke detectors.
Security guards are on-site conducting access control and rounds 24/7/365. Entry into
the data center is restricted by [CONTACT_200359].
The data center and external building access points are monitored with video surveillance.
In 2011 the data center began a large scale VMware server virtualization deployment.
Currently, the data center has virtualized about 95% of its environment. The virtual
environment consists of more than 160 virtual servers and nearly 20 physical servers. The
data center's virtualization solution provides key advantages:
high availability { in the event of hardware failure, virtual servers automatically go
back online in a seamless process.

exible infrastructure { disk storage, memory and processor capacity can be increased
or reallocated at any time.
rapid deployment { servers can be provisioned on-demand with minimal waiting on
hardware of software.
The data center has enhanced its storage resources by [CONTACT_67940] a networked
storage system to support its virtualized environment. The data center currently manages
over 50 teraby[CONTACT_46784]. The storage solution consists of Dell's EqualLogic PS Series
Storage system for providing a virtualized storage area network (SAN). Some of the
benets that are realized through this technology are:
storage architecture is not a bottleneck for IT services;
improved performance;
tiered storage;
provisioning and reclamation of SAN disk is ecient; and most important,
complete redundancy from the SAN fabric architecture.
Production servers running critical applications are clustered and congured for failover
events. Servers are backed up with encryption through a dedicated backup server that
connects across an internal [ADDRESS_238972]. DCC storage area net-
working (SAN) applications, clusters, and switch-to-switch links are also on a [ADDRESS_238973] Registry Protocol Version 1.00
Protocol Version Date: September 9, 2016
The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network
Protocol 036 (Alpern) Page 21 of 32
every Friday. Tapes are stored in a reproof safe inside the data center facility, and full
backups are taken o site on a weekly basis to an o-site commercial storage facility.
In the event of catastrophic failure, such as a re in the server facility, daily backups
would probably survive because of the re suppression system and reproof safe, but there
would be obvious delay in re-establishing data center function because the servers will not
survive such a disaster. Total destruction of the data center facility could cause the loss
of up to one week's data. In future investments, the data center is making co-location,
disaster recovery and business continuity solutions a top priority.
DCC information systems are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to all users
unless a scheduled maintenance interruption is required. If this occurs, we notify all users
of the relevant systems, and data entry can be deferred until after the interruption is over.
Critical systems availability has exceeded 99.9% for the past two years, and there has
been no unscheduled downtime in over ve years.
6.2 Data Transmission
All data transmission to the DCC over public networks is encrypted with virtual point-to-
point sessions using secure socket layer (SSL) or virtual private network (VPN) technolo-
gies, both of which provide at least 128 bit encryption. No study data will be transferred
by [CONTACT_6968].
6.3 Data Security and Condentiality
The data center coordinates the network infrastructure and security with the Health
Sciences Campus (HSC) information systems at the University of Utah. This provides us
with eective rewall hardware, automatic network intrusion detection, and the expertise
of dedicated security experts working at the University. Network equipment includes four
high-speed switches. User authentication is centralized with two Windows 2008 domain
servers. Communication over public networks is encrypted with virtual point-to-point
sessions using secure socket layer (SSL) or virtual private network (VPN) technologies,
both of which provide at least [ADDRESS_238974] access to data cen-
ter machines is only available while physically located inside our oces, or via a VPN client.
All network trac is monitored for intrusion attempts, security scans are regularly run
against our servers, and our IT sta is notied of intrusion alerts. Security is maintained
PECARN Medical Record Registry Protocol Version 1.00
Protocol Version Date: September 9, 2016
The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network
Page 22 of 32 Protocol 036 (Alpern)
with Windows 2008 user/group domain-level security. Users are required to change their
passwords every 90 days, and workstations time out after 5 minutes of inactivity. All les
are protected at group and user levels; database security is handled in a similar manner
with group-level access to databases, tables, and views in Microsoft SQL Server. Finally,
all laptop computers in use in the DCC or in the Department of Pediatrics are whole-disk
encrypted.
The data center uses control center tools to continuously monitor systems and failure
alerts. Environmental and network systems are also monitored to ensure up time. Highly
trained system administrators on sta are available to respond in high risk emergency
events.
All personnel involved with the DCC have signed condentiality agreements concerning
data encountered in the course of their daily work. All personnel (including administrative
sta) have received Human Subjects Protection and Health Information Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) education. We require all users to sign specic agreements
concerning security, condentiality, and use of our information systems, before access is
provided.
6.[ADDRESS_238975] such as this one. When the
study is completed, the DCC will prepare a distributable database in compliance with
these Federal requirements. This database will be de-identied suciently that it will not
be subject to [ADDRESS_238976]
(HIPAA). Note that the limited PHI in the analysis database (month, year, clinician and
encrypted medical record number) is used in order to direct performance measure reports,
but these variables will not be included in the database produced for sharing with other
researchers.
Access to this research database will be managed in accordance with PECARN
data sharing policies and applicable Federal laws. Registry data in this study will
not be provided back to participating study sites except as outlined in the protocol
(specic performance report cards for quality improvement initiatives). Each site, of
course, has its own original data and can conduct its own quality improvement activities.
Individual clinicians may request the encrypted study identiers of patients included in
their performance report card, in order to enable their review of the medical record to
identify opportunities for future performance improvement.

The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network
Protocol 036 (Alpern) Page [ADDRESS_238977] (IRB) approval will be required from all sites participating
in this study, including the PECARN Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The DCC will
maintain documentation of initial and on-going approval at each site, and this documen-
tation will be required in order for a site to submit electronic data to the DCC.
7.1.1 Expedited IRB Approval
Expedited IRB approval is requested for this study. Expedited IRB approval procedures
are permissible when the research activities present no more than minimal risk to human
subjects, and only involve procedures listed in specic categories listed in the regulations
at Federal Register 63:[ZIP_CODE], 1998, [ADDRESS_238978],
the procedures fall under Category 5, which is research that involves materials (data,
documents, records) that have been collected, or will be collected, solely for non-research
purposes (e.g., medical treatment, diagnosis). All data in this study are from the medical
records produced during the on-going clinical activities of the participating centers.
7.[ADDRESS_238979] the option of not reviewing provided
feedback.
Waiver of informed consent from the clinicians is requested because risks to the
individual clinicians are minimal (Section 7.4.3 on page 25), the waiver will not adversely
aect the rights and welfare of the clinicians, uniform participation is necessary for the

scientic validity of the study, and the clinicians will receive information about their
performance during the study. These are the four requirements for waiver of informed
consent outlined in 45 CFR x46.116(d).
Waiver of informed consent and assent from patients is requested for this project.
Specic patients are not the subjects of study, but rather, their ED visit contributes infor-
mation about the sites and clinicians, which are the subjects of study. The requirements
of 45 CFRx46.116(d) are also met for the patient population, as the risk is minimal,
the rights and welfare of the patients are not being aected, and uniform inclusion of
all patients is necessary for the scientic validity of the study. There is no provision for
providing additional pertinent information to patients, as they are not the subjects of the
study.
7.3 Waiver of Written Authorization for HIPAA
Waiver of authorization for use and/or disclosure of protected health information under the
the Privacy Rule is requested for this study. Waiver of authorization for the use of patient
electronic health record data is permissible under x164.512(i)(2)(ii). The requirements
are that the use of the data involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of the
patients, that the research could not practicably conducted without the waiver, and the
research cannot be conducted without access to the data. Written authorization is not
practicable in the urgent environment of the ED, data are being abstracted long after the
patient has departed the ED, and the scientic validity of the study would be destroyed
since all visits must be included in order to determine the performance measures. The
use or disclosure of the protected health information involves no more than minimal risk
to the individuals because:
There is an adequate plan to protect the identiers from improper use and disclosure.
The PECARN DCC has provided Business Associate Agreements for execution
by [CONTACT_133032], and the security of its information systems has been
described in Section 6.3 on page 21.
There is provision to destroy identiers before integrating patient data into the
registry, and the de-identication procedures are thoroughly discussed in Section
??.
The protected health information will not be reused or disclosed to any other persons
or entities, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], or for authorized oversight of the research
project.

and satellite emergency departments (EDs) of the participating sites for all patients. The
registry currently contains data from seven hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200339]
2012, and will accrue records from participating sites for at least the next ve calendar
years.
Inclusion in the registry will be regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender. Inclusion will
be regardless of diagnosis or chronic health condition. Clinicians will be included in the
protocol regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender.
7.4.[ADDRESS_238981] access to identiable private information about some or all subjects. After
de-identication procedures are nalized by [CONTACT_15791] (Section 4.4 on page 13), the
procedures will be carried out at each clinical site, on their servers within their rewall.
Then the encrypted components of the EHR will be submitted electronically using a
secure system hosted by [CONTACT_15791]. At the DCC, the DCC PI, data managers, statisticians,
and other sta may have access to a limited set of identiable information.
7.4.[ADDRESS_238982] Registry Protocol Version 1.00
Protocol Version Date: September 9, 2016
The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network
Page 26 of 32 Protocol 036 (Alpern)
The DCC maintains a study key to allow for appropriate identication of visits pertaining
to each practitioner and also to allow for distribution of the report cards. This decreases
the risk to practitioners as identication is not known by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_200340].
All individual feedback reports are anonymized to protect the identication of clinicians,
and all published results will be presented in aggregate form.
7.[ADDRESS_238983]
will be conducted using de-identied data. Data will be housed at the DCC, for which
security was previously described (Section 6.3 on page 21).
The performance measures involved in the current report cards have been carefully
developed to include only ones with a strong evidence base and endorsement by [CONTACT_200360]. Audit and feedback concerning clinical care is a
regular activity in all health care organizations. All published results will be presented
in the aggregate and care will be taken to keep identication of sites and investigators
condential.
7.5.[ADDRESS_238984] Registry Protocol Version 1.00
Protocol Version Date: September 9, 2016
The EMSC Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network
Protocol 036 (Alpern) Page [ADDRESS_238985] will continue using the Registry to enable quality performance measures of
emergency healthcare for children across participating EDs (base and satellite) in the
Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. It compares quality performance
measures of emergency care provided to children across dierent institutions by [CONTACT_200361], enabling hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200341].
The Registry enables participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200342]-
specic feedback and benchmarks of care on quality measures that are within the locus of
control of the individual provider. The feedback may directly improve the quality of care
of future patients treated by [CONTACT_200362].
7.7 Importance of Knowledge to be Gained
In its 2006 report, \Emergency Care for Children: Growing Pains", the Institute of
Medicine recommended that pediatric emergency medical systems support the development
and measurement of standards for emergency care performance measurement. The ability
to accurately and comprehensively assess the process and outcomes of care in pediatric
emergency patients is imperative to the evaluation of the quality of care provided. Past
endeavors have been limited by [CONTACT_200363]. The PECARN Registry has allowed
for the comprehensive and scalable determination of quality performance measures using
an electronic health record registry across multiple sites. It has enabled evaluation of
the impact of providing provider-specic feedback and benchmarks of care on quality
measures that are within the locus of control of the individual provider. In addition,
the systematic and widespread collection and reporting of performance and outcomes,
using the same operational denitions, is critical to allow clinicians and other emergency
care stakeholders to continue to work together to innovate and improve care beyond the
local level. The PECARN Registry has demonstrated potential to improve the care of
children in the emergency setting, and continuation of the Registry will enable continued
improvement of care to this vulnerable population.

[ADDRESS_238986]. Rigorous de-identication procedures will be
conducted to produce the analysis database with a minimum of Protected Health Infor-
mation (PHI). Specically, the analysis database will have the month and year of visit.
If unexpected additional PHI is detected in submitted data by [CONTACT_200364], it will be de-identied by [CONTACT_15791], and feedback will be provided to the clinical
site(s) to further rene the de-identication procedures so that this does not recur.
Data elements for race, ethnicity, and gender of subjects will be preserved. These demo-
graphic data are required for Federal reporting purposes to delineate subject accrual by
[CONTACT_545], ethnicity, and gender.
All study sites have been oered a Business Associate Agreement with the University of
Utah, which agrees to handle submitted data with the security precautions required for
PHI. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_200343].
9 Inclusion of Women and Minorities
Data from the emergency department (ED) electronic health record of all patients seen at
the protocol sites will be included. Visits will be included without regard to patient race
or ethnicity. A diversity of ethnic and racial backgrounds is represented at the selected
PECARN sites.

ABSTRACT  
PURPOSE OF STUDY: To identify barriers to successful transitions that are most meaningful 
to patients and families, and use these identified barriers to iteratively adapt an existing nurse 
home visit program to address these barriers. This study will also test the efficacy of a nurse 
home visit intervention in improving post -discharge outcomes.  
BACKGROUND: The transition from inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65253] a vulnerable 
time for patients and their families . Poor transitions may lead to complications and wors e patient 
outcomes , both in terms of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65254], as well as family -centered outcomes, such as 
missed school and work, or increased out -of-pocket costs.  
AIMS:  Aim [ADDRESS_71040] of the nurse home visit on patient and family -centered outcomes by 
[CONTACT_65311]/approach of the nurse home visit based 
on the results of Aim [ADDRESS_71041] -of-care-controlled prospective study to determine the efficacy of a nurse home visit 
program, an intervention adapted f rom those studied in other populations (i.e., adults, high -risk 
infants) and re -engineered through Aim 2, in improving pediatric patient transitions from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104] . Aim [ADDRESS_71042] -hoc analysis is to 
understand our Aim 3 results. Semi -structured interviews  and focus groups will be  conducted 
with the following key stakeholders : inpatient ward bedside nurses, home health care nurses 
(who provided the intervention), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65255] (non -study team), primary care 
physicians, patients currently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65256], and participants previously enrolled in 
Aim [ADDRESS_71043] information 
from the readmission review committe es for patients enrolled in Aim 3 who were readmitted 
within 30 -days of their initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
METHODS: Aim [ADDRESS_71044] ed after the home visit to assess 
the quality and content of the nurse home visit. We will also complete an “Aim 2” optimization 
period for the follow -up phone calls using similar methods. Aim [ADDRESS_71045]: We have multiple planned 
[ADDRESS_71046]-hoc analysis  Qualitative analysis:   We will use 
qualitative methods in the form of qualitative interviews  and focus groups. We  aim to recruit 20 
members  from each stakeholder group for the qualitative interviews and focus groups . The 
stakeholder groups include 1) parents of currently admitted patients 2) parents of children 
previously enrolled in Aim 3 intervention arm  3, parents of children previously enrolled in Aim 3 
control arm  3) primary care providers 4) inpatient attending physicians 5) bedside nurses 6) 
homecare nurses. Parents of currently admitted patients will be eligible if they were eligible for 
Aim 3 (i.e. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65257], Engl ish speaking, >18 
years of age).  Patients previously enrolled in Aim 3 will be contact[CONTACT_65312]. Primary care 
providers will be recruited at standing meetings while they are at CCHMC or via phone.  Bedside 
nurses and inpatient attendings will be recruited from care providers on the general pediatric and 
neurosurgical floors.   Readmission Analysis:  As part of an ongoing quality improvement work 
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], teams of physicians and nurses review [ADDRESS_71047] readmission review data from the readmission teams for patients enrolled in Aim 3.   
 
CONCLUSION: We will identify family -specific barriers to successfu l transitions of care, and 
adapt nurse home visits to address these barriers. We will then assess if the nurse home visits 
reduce these barriers, as well as other risks identified a priori  such as healthcare reutilization, 
though a randomized control trial . We expect our findings to support the spread of nurse home 
visit programs to other patients, conditions, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
 
PURPOSE OF STUDY  
The transition process from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65258]. Aim [ADDRESS_71048] meaningful to patients and 
families. A deeper understanding of such barriers will allow us to more effectively tailor 
interventions to address them. Readmissions are typi[INVESTIGATOR_65259]. However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65260]. 
Other outcomes studied in adults, such as medication errors (e.g., medication discrepancies) and 
PCP confidence in managing the patient’s future problems,[ADDRESS_71049] aided care 
transitions for medically complex patients requiring respi[INVESTIGATOR_45507] (e.g., tracheostomy 
management), enteral or “tube” feedings, or infusion therapy. The nurse home visit paradigm has 
also been applied to adults and high -risk infants.[ADDRESS_71050] been successful at reducing health resource utilization, inclu ding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5449], virtually all studies addressed barriers defined a priori . Aim 2  will use a home 
nursing visit and phone call to address barriers identified in Aim 1. Quality improvement (QI) 
4 
 methods will be used to adapt the current processes to ensure that the visit  and phone call  
addresses barriers reported by [CONTACT_65313] “health system -centric” barriers. 
Aim [ADDRESS_71051]-hoc analysis  Qualitative analysis: We will use  engagement interviews to provide a 
comprehensive  understanding regarding the results of Aim [ADDRESS_71052] greater access to care 
or improved parental engagement in their child’s health. Alternatively, this could reflect 
unwarranted healthcare uti lization as a result of the intervention.  Therefore it is imperative to 
conduct interviews  and focus groups  to further understand our results.  Readmission analysis:  In 
Aim 3, we found  patients randomized to the intervention had more post -discharge health care 
utilization.  This was driven, in part, due to an increase in 30 day readmissions.  Understanding if 
the readmissions were necessary or preventabl e is important in understanding  our Aim 3 
findings.  As part of ongoing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65261], teams of nurses and physicians review 
30 day readmissions on a unit -basis (for example, the medical director and nurses from A6 
review all readmissions to that unit).  The readmission team assesses if the readmission was 
necessary or avoidable.  We will request the results of these reviews for Aim [ADDRESS_71053] short -term- worry, distress, anxiety, 
fear for the future, guilt, stress, and poorer parent health following their child’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].7,[ADDRESS_71054] the child at risk of poor outcomes.5,10 Safe discharge involves 
numerous steps, including reliable communication with families and primary care providers 
(PCP), coordination of care, and family understanding of and comfort with the management 
plan.[ADDRESS_71055] a family’s comfort with caring for 
5 
 their child after discharge.12 For example, one parent with whom we recently spoke about the 
transition home lamented that “When we came home, we didn’t know what to do.” Families also 
experience a sense of abandonment at their inability to contact [CONTACT_65314].[ADDRESS_71056] -discharge 
complications.  
Burden of poor transitions  
Poor transitions may lead to complications and worse patient outcomes. Readmissions, which 
often exceed 20% in adults,[ADDRESS_71057] poor transitions from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] t o home. In 
children, readmissions occur less commonly. The mean 30 -day readmission rate among 72 
children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65262] 6.5%; however, there was substantial variability with readmissions 
ranging from 4.5% to 8% across hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], even after accounting for  age and underlying 
conditions ( Figure 1 , each point represents data from one hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65263] 95% 
confidence intervals).15 Some children experience multiple readmissions. Across 43 children’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], 2.9% of patients had four or 
more readmissions and accounte d for 
18.8% of total admissions and 23.2% of 
total inpatient charges over the 365 -day 
period following their index admission.16 
 
There are additional consequences that 
may result from poor transitions, including 
emergency department (ED) revisits, 
medication errors, PCP dissatisfaction with 
communication or divergent understanding 
of discharge care responsibilities, patient 
or family dissatisfaction wit h discharge 
process communication, and unanticipated out -of-pocket costs. ED revisit rates for common 
pediatric conditions vary across hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65264] 5% to 11%.17,18 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65265] a high rate of medication errors (55 medication errors per 100 
admissions in one study)[ADDRESS_71058] them at risk for harm.19-21 The likelihood of error during the 
transition from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104], when medications are added or changed, is even greater. Poor 
communication may also lead to dissatisfaction; only one -third of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based physicians  (i.e., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65266]) and PCPs were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with the state of communication 
between inpatient and outpatient settings.22 This same study found that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65267], including who would follow -up 
pending laboratory results and take responsibility for changes in a patient’s clinical condition. 
Without clearly defined physician roles to maintain continuity of care, patients are at greater risk 
for clinical de terioration and adverse events.  Concerns over out -of-pocket costs not addressed 
during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65268], leading to worse outcomes 
such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394].23 For example, among all medical -related admissions in U.S. 
adults, 33% to 69% are due to poor medication adherence, with a resultant cost of ~$[ADDRESS_71059]’s inhabitants. Census tracts were 
chosen as our primary geographic unit given their relative homogeneity and their utility in 
detecting socioeconomic gradients.33-[ADDRESS_71060]’s rate of poverty, defined as the percentage of individuals living 
below the poverty line. Using the dist ribution of poverty within CCHMC Home Care’s primary 
service area, we have defined thresholds to separate individuals into three socioeconomically 
distinct groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]. These groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], which will define the three focus group strata, are based on 
[ADDRESS_71061] with <5%, 5 -20%, or >20% of 
the population living in poverty.32 These cut -points were also chosen to ensure a sufficient 
number of eligible focus group participants within each stratum. Census tracts where >20% of 
individuals live below the poverty line are considered to be “poverty areas.”36 We used data from 
the U.S. Census’ American Community Survey [ADDRESS_71062] of the nurse home visit on patient and family -centered 
outcomes by [CONTACT_65311]/approach of the nurse 
home visit based on the results of Aim [ADDRESS_71063] (PDSA) tests will target several a priori  measures that address clinical outcomes, patient and 
family experience outcomes, and care delivery processes, and we will target additional patient - 
and family -centered measures identified during Aim 1. A QI approach is appropriate for refining 
the intervention because progress is accelerated by [CONTACT_65315].[ADDRESS_71064] -discharge care plan 
including discharge instructions and PCP follow -up with a goal of ensuring that the child is 
medically stable and the family is comfortable with provid ing the child’s care. The processes of 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_65269] 1 to fully meet the 
transition of care needs for patients and families not eligible for traditional home health (longer 
term home visitation s ervices for the medically complex), but who may be at risk for adverse 
outcomes associated with their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65270].  
 
Quality Improvement Processes  
Several co -investigators and collaborators on this project , includin g physicians, nurses, and 
parents will work with frontline medical staff (inpatient nurses, home health nurses, and 
8 
 physicians) as a team to execute the goals of Aim 2. Many of these team members are already 
working together during this pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731].  
 
Optimizing Nurse Home Visits:  We will review the data from Aim 1 to better understand the 
barriers patients and families face , as well as  the goals or outcomes they value. These data will 
inform our initial approach and cycles of tests will allow us to refine the discrete outcomes 
within Aim 2 that we will be targeting. A priori , these outcomes will be organized within several 
domains: clinical outcomes  such as health care reutilization, patient/family experience outcomes  
such as confidence in care at home, and  care delivery process outcomes  such as medicine 
reconciliation accuracy or follow -up with PCP. Once initial outcomes are defined, we will 
specify hypotheses about what is needed to achieve or drive the outcomes. These “key drivers” 
will then focus subsequ ent cycles of tests.37 The team will meet every 1 to 2 weeks with the goal 
of reviewing data and designing new iterations to be  tested on the 5 -10 nurse home visits that 
follow.  
 
Optimizing Nurse Phone Calls: Using the methods above, already proven highly successful in 
Aim [ADDRESS_71065] our outcomes is limited; randomization is 
essential to the study design in order to avoid potential bias of intervention effect. 
Randomization will allow us to balance unknown or unmeasured potential confounders. While it 
is impossible to  blind patients to the trial arm, an earnest effort will be taken to blind the clinical 
research staff  completing the follow -up phone call to the intervention assignment.  
 
We w ill complete a single center, randomized, standard -of-care-controlled prospectiv e study to 
determine the effectiveness  of a nurse home visit, an intervention adapted from those studied in 
other populations (i.e., adults, high -risk infants) and re -engineered through Aim 2, in improving 
pediatric patient transitions from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65271] e (Figure 2). We hypothesize that a structured 
nurse home visit  within [ADDRESS_71066] -of-care. We also hypothesize that there will be a 
significant improvement in family -defined outcome measures that will be identified in Aim 1.  
 
Figure 2: Outline of the proposed research design  
 

[ADDRESS_71067] to PCP verbal and written communication prior to 
discharge, written documentation for the family regarding prescribed medication regimen, 
recommended follow -up with outpatient PCP and relevant consultant(s), and delivery of 
prescribed medications from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65272]’s bedside (Figure 2 ). Patients 
randomized to the intervention arm will receive the sa me standard -of-care plus a nurse home 
visit within days of discharge.  
 
Enrolled p atients and their families  will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_71068] service general vs. surgical service to ensure equal 
allocation of the intervention within ea ch stratification block. Random permutations within each 
block within each stratum will be generated using a random number generator available in SAS 
Proc Plan. The use of randomization in the study design is crucial for avoiding bias in the 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the nurse home visit intervention. Patients and families cannot 
be blinded given that the nature of the intervention is a nurse home visit. However, we will 
attempt to mitigate the potential bias in the following manner: 1) Families wi ll be asked to 
refrain from disclosing intervention status to the interviewer at the follow -up phone call; and 2) 
Study staff will be blinded to treatment assignment when making the follow -up phone call. Study 
staff will use a written script to administer the survey. At the start of the call, families will be 
reminded to refrain from disclosing their intervention status.  
 
Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects:  
We have multiple planned analyses to examine potential heterogeneity of treatment effect of the 
nurse visit. Factors included in the HET analysis are insurance, primary care access, financial 
strain, caregiver education, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65273], and medical complexity.  Medical complexity will 
be determined by [CONTACT_65316] (PMCA). The PMCA is a publicly 
available algorithm that identifies children with complex chronic disease (who have accessed 
tertiary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422]) . The algorithm includes three levels of medical complexity: children with 
complex chronic disease (C -CD), children w ith non -complex chronic disease (NC -CD), and 
children without chronic disease (CD).   In order to calculate the PMCA we will collect additional 
administrative data for all patients enrolled in Aims 3 and 4.  This data will include: ICD9 
Codes /ICD10 codes , procedure codes, admission date , discharge  dates, admitting and d ischarge  
departments . We will capture all outpatient, urgent care, ED, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65274] (February 1, 2012 to April 30, 2016). The PMCA will be calculated bas ed 
on a [ADDRESS_71069] our outcomes is limited; randomization  is 
essential to the study design in order to avoid potential bias of intervention effect. 
Randomization will allow us to balance unknown or unmeasured potential confounders. While it 
is impossible to blind patients to the trial arm, an earnest effort will  be taken to blind the clinical 
research staff  completing the [ADDRESS_71070] -of-care-controlled prospective study to 
determine the effectiveness  of a nurse phone  call program, an intervention adapted from those 
studied in other populations (i.e., adults, high -risk infants) and re -engineered through Aim 2, in 
improving pediatric patient tr ansitions from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104] . We hypothesize that a structured 
nurse telep hone call  within [ADDRESS_71071] to PCP ve rbal and written communication prior to 
discharge, written documentation for the family regarding prescribed medication regimen, 
recommended follow -up with outpatient PCP and relevant consultant(s), and delivery of 
prescribed medications from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65272]’s bedside.  Patients randomized 
to the intervention arm will receive the same standard -of-care plus a nurse phone call  within days 
of discharge.  
 
Enrolled p atients and their families  will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_71072] -of-care using a permuted block randomization stratified by [CONTACT_65317] (Ohio vs. Kentucky)  to ensure equal allocation of the intervention within each 
stratification block. Random permutations within each block within each stratum will be 
generated using a random number generator available in SAS Proc Plan. The use of 
randomization in the study design is crucial for avoiding bias in the evaluation of the 
effectiveness of the nurse phone call  intervention. Patients and f amilies cannot be blinded given 
that the nature of the intervention is a nurse phone  call. However, we will attempt to mitigate the 
potential bias in the following manner: 1) Families will be asked to refrain from disclosing 
intervention status to the inte rviewer at the follow -up phone call; and 2) Study staff will be 
blinded to treatment assignment when making the follow -up phone call. Study staff will use a 
written script to administer the survey. At the start of the call, families will be reminded to 
refrain from disclosing their intervention status.  
 
 
 
Post-Hoc Analysis  
Qualitative Analysis:  The post -hoc analysis  of this proposal will use qualitative methods, 
specifically interviews  and focus groups.  At the completion of the post -hoc analysis, we will 
have an improved understanding of  the experiences, challenges, and successes of pediatric 
inpatient -to-outpatient transitions from the perspective of families and providers .  Qualitative 
methods are the best means to generate consensus themes about patient  and family experiences 
and preferences during inpatient -to-outpatient transitions. Interviews  will be used to gain insight 
into what families and providers believe to be both the most relevant barriers to successful 
transition and the outcomes they find t o be most meaningful. Participants will respond to semi -
structured interview s and focus groups . The  interviewer will use follow -up probes to expand and 
clarify responses and further elucidate the context of the responses. This qualitative methods 
process will permit us to gain  unique perspectives and understand more deeply our results.

 Readmission Analysis:  
Review of all readmissions occur at the unit level lead by [CONTACT_65318].  We 
will request information regarding the review of the  readmissions including assessment of 
preventability or possibility of avoiding the readmission.  If there are any readmissions to the 
units which were not reviewed, we would ask the readmission team to please review the case as 
they normally would.  If th ey are unable to complete the standard readmission review, the 
assessment of preventability would be missing in our study.   We will compare the percentage of 
readmissions designated as potentially preventable in those patients randomized to the 
interventi on in Aim [ADDRESS_71073] -hoc analysis, we are  extending the completion 
of final data analysis and dissemination plans to September 2017.

Service , Neurosurgery Service, or the Neurology S ervice . Exclusion criteria for Aims 1 -3 are if 
the patient is discharged to a residential facility, their home residence is outside the home nursing 
service area  (in Ohio within  55 miles of Base) , if they are eligible for “traditional” home care 
services, or if the caregiver is non -English speaking.

the caregiver is non -English speaking.  
 
Inclusion criteri a for the qualitative post-hoc analysis  is that the patient must be admitted to 
either the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65277] , the Adolescent Medicine Service at base, the 
Community Pediatrics Service  at base, or the Neurosurgical services . The parents  must reside

Post Hoc analysis  
[ADDRESS_71076] on the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65278] a child’s admission. We anticipate it 
will take approximately [ADDRESS_71077] all of the families that participate in this aim via phon e to 
participate in a short follow -up call.   
 
Clinical research coordinators will also identify up to 100 patients during this Aim that receive 
primary care at one of the three CCHMC primary care clinics (Pediatric Primary Care Center, 
Hopple Street Clini c, and Fairfield Primary Care). We will review the patient’s chart to assess 
return visits to primary care [ADDRESS_71078]-Hoc Analysis  
Qualitative Analysis: All patients, fam ilies, and care providers that meet the above inclusion and 
exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study . We anticipate enrolling up to 20 participants from 
each of the following groups: 1) parents of currently admitted patients 2) parents of children  
previously enrolled in Aim 3 intervention arm  3) parents of children previously enrolled in Aim 
3 control arm 4 ) primary care providers 5) inpatient attending physicians 6) bedside nurses 7) 
homecare nurses.  
 
Readmission Analysis: We will include all pat ients enrolled in Aim [ADDRESS_71079] during the phone call will bias our results.  
 
For the phone call optimization, we wil l use a similar process as described above. Either a 
clinical research coordinator or a home care resource nurse will approach patients and families in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65279] a nurse phone call after discharge; families are free to choose to 
receive th e call or not. If they choose to receive a nurse phone call, the home care resource nurse 
will schedule a time to complete the nurse phone call, and the clinical research coordinator will 
have the family complete a W9 form and get good phone numbers for th e feedback call 1 -7 days 
after the nurse phone call. Because this aim is quality improvement in nature, we are asking for a 
waiver of written consent; families will be asked to provide verbal consent before completing the 
phone call.  
 
Aim 3  
Patients admitted to CCHMC will be recruited for the study during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. A 
CRC will screen the patient to review inclusion and exclusion criteria; eligible patients and their 
families will be invited to participate in the randomized cont rol trial. The parent or caregiver will 
provide informed written consent and patients with a developmental age of [ADDRESS_71080] ay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Families will be given time to read the consent and 
assent forms, and study staff will also verbally go through the forms and allow families to ask 
questions.   The ACE questionnaire will be limited to parents ages 18 or older . 
 
Aim 4

 Patients admitted to CCHMC will be recruited for the study during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. A 
CRC will screen the patient to review inclusion and exclusion criteria; eligible patients and their 
families will be invited to participate in the randomized contro l trial. The parent or caregiver will 
provide informed written consent and patients with a developmental age of [ADDRESS_71081]-Hoc A nalysis  
Qualitative Analysis:  Research personnel will approach families either via phone or during the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], provide study information, obtain verbal consent, and schedule a time for the 
intervie w. Research personnel will also approach clinicians and nurses either via phone or in -
person at CCHMC to obtain verbal consent and schedule an interview time  and/ or focus group. 
Families, clinicians and nurses will have as much time as they need to consider  enrollment in the 
study. O n enrollment we will ask participants permission to share their experiences and opi[INVESTIGATOR_65280] [ADDRESS_71082] as much time as they need to c onsider enrollment in the study. Study staff 
will explain the study and allow time for participants to ask questions.  Please see attached Study 
Summary S heet for these participants that will be given to them to allow for verbal consent to 
participate in the engagement interview  and/or focus groups . We are requesting a waiver of 
documentation of consent and the following justifications support such a reques t.  
 1. Due to conducting a portion of our interviews over the phone we cannot obtain a 
documentation of consent. This study could not be practicably carried out without a waiver.  
 2. This study procedure will not adversely affect the rights or welfare of  the participants. 
The purpose of the study is to gain a deeper understanding of our Aim 3 results.  Participants will 
be given a summary sheet of the study and also be given time to think about participating in the 
study and given time to ask questions.  
 3. All transcripts will be stripped of identifiers and we will ensure confidentiality of 
participants’ responses, including asking participants to protect the confidentiality of responses 
made by [CONTACT_2312].  
 
Readmission Review:  
REQUEST FOR WAIVER of Document ation of Consent for Readmission Review  
We ask for a waiver of written consent as the assessment of preventability is done as a review of 
existing medical records.  This review is part of an ongoing quality improvement project not 
directly part of this res earch study.  
 
REQUEST FOR WAIVER of Documentation of Consent for Heterogeneity of Treatment Effect  
We ask for a waiver of written consent as this administrative data is done as a review of existing 
medical records.

 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Aim 1  
An open -ended s emi-structured question guide will be developed by [CONTACT_65319]. We will also include a short, anonymous demographic survey for the parents to 
fill out before the focus group , and will include patient demographics (age, gender, race, 
insurance, address) collected from the child’s medical record.  The questions are designed to 
stimulate and engage the participants to respond in their own words and to extract what is most 
meaningful to them. An experienced focus group modera tor will use probes to further elucidate 
the responses and expand discussion by [CONTACT_48780]. The question guide will be revised in 
an iterative fashion after the first and second groups to refine questions that were unclear and to 
add questions abou t unanticipated issues arising in the first groups. The same question guide will 
be used in subsequent groups so that consistent questions are posed to all participants. 
Participants will complete a brief demographic questionnaire at the beginning of each session. 
Focus groups will last approximately 90 minutes. We will ensure confidentiality of participants' 
responses, including asking participants to protect the confidentiality of responses made by 
[CONTACT_2312]. The focus groups will be audio -taped and transcri bed verbatim. Transcripts will be 
stripped of identifiers and reviewed for accuracy.  The focus groups will be held in the CCHMC 
Family Resource Center (FRC) at dates and times convenient to families.  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_71083] information on demographics, indication for the visit, 
and goals for the nurse home visit mutually -agreed upon by [CONTACT_65320]. We also 
believe that there will be iterative qualitative and quantitative elements that the nurses may 
address during the home visit, which will be defined based on the focus groups in Aim 1. 
Clinical research coordinators (CRCs) will review the medical record of each patient that was 
referred for a nurse home visit to assess if medication reconciliation occurred at the follow -up 
visit, if the mutually -agreed upon goals were addressed at  the visit, and if the patient had any 
unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], ED, or outpatient utilization. Assessing unplanned utilization for all patients 
will be limited to reviewing CCHMC billing data, but we plan to compare hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65281] e subsample of patients that receive a follow -up call. The follow -up call, 
completed [ADDRESS_71084] -discharge health care reutilization, defined for this 
Aim as readmission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65282] E D. The core patient and family experience 
outcome measure will be an assessment of the family’s comfort in managing care of the patient 
at home, completed at the end of the nurse home visit. Measured on a 5 -point Likert scale, this 
single question will als o be asked before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65283] a 
family baseline. The core care delivery process measures will focus on two key processes:  
medicine reconciliation - measured by [CONTACT_65321] 
[ADDRESS_71085] make during the visit - and addressing key barriers discussed by [CONTACT_65322] -measured as a yes/no - that all key needs were addressed.  We expect 
these core measures, with some modifications based on da ta collection strategies, will also be 
used during the randomized trial in Aim 3. We expect to add to and modify this set of measures 
based on the Aim [ADDRESS_71086] feedback about the nurse phone calls and use this feedback to improve further calls in an 
iterative fashion.  
 
Aims 3 and 4  
Initial Questionnaire:  Face -to-face interviews will be conducted in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65284]. We will assess demographic characteristics, such as race, 
ethnicity, and age for both the parent/caregiver and patient. We will assess parent or caregiver 
marital status, education, househol d income, employment status,  resilience , and parental 
activation . In addition, we will assess the ACE (adverse childhood experience) score of parents 
ages [ADDRESS_71087]. It does not indicate current exposure . High er scores (ACE score greater than or equal to 4) 
have been associated with poorer adult health outcomes. Parental ACE scores have demonstrated  
an association with risk for childhood adversity in an outpatient setting.  The questions 
encompass all forms of childhood trauma, including whether the participant was exposed to a 
household member  that was depressed or suicidal or if the participant had been abused as a child. 
The ACE questionnaire  will be provided as a handout for the stud y participant to fill out . It will 
be supplemented with a handout with the contact [CONTACT_65323] . It 
will be returned by [CONTACT_65324] a sealed envelope to the research coordinator. It may 
be left blank by  [CONTACT_65325]. We will also 
assess the patient’s medical history and their access to primary care , as well as other variables 
that arise from Aims [ADDRESS_71088] prot ected electronic 
database.   
 
Aim 3 Nurse Home Visit Intervention:  The intervention for Aim [ADDRESS_71089], in Aim 1 we will be assessing current users’ perceptions of the 
services as well as better defining the patient - and family - desired outcomes. In Aim 2, we will 
test small changes to the home visit elements and processes as informed by [CONTACT_45061] 1 results.  
 
Aim 4 Nurse Phone Call Intervention:  The interve ntion for Aim [ADDRESS_71090], in the optimization phase  we will be assessing early  users’ 
perceptions of the and we will test small changes to the phone call  elements and processes as 
informed by  [CONTACT_65326] . 
 
Follow -up Questionnaire:  A follow -up questionnaire to assess 14-day post -discharge outcomes 
will be conducted in both the control and intervention groups 14-[ADDRESS_71091] protected 
electronic database.  
 
For approximately 40 of our patients, the research coordinator asked the p arent’s race as opposed 
to the patient’s race for Aim [ADDRESS_71092] these participants 
via text message and phone call to ask the patient’s race. We will also be asking the patients 
some questions regarding their experienc e with the intervention (nurse home visit) in Aim 3. We 
are asking these additional questions in order to use this feedback for future research studies as 
well as to help the flow of the call.  
 
Medical Record Review: We will receive all enrolled patients 3 0-day reutilization (readmission 
and ED revisit) data from HealthBridge. HealthBridge is an organization that receives admission 
and emergency room data from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65285]. This will allow 
us to track reutilization outcom es at [ADDRESS_71093] similar data for our primary outcomes from all patients.  
 
Health Network at Cincinnati Children’s : We are working closely with the Health Network at 
Cincinnat i Children’s (HNCC) to determine how much overlap exists between their patients and 
the patients enrolled in H2O. We are requesting permission to share our enrolled patient list with 
them, which will allow them to notify us which patients we’ve enrolled ar e also receiving 
services, such as intensive case management or a community health worker, among others, from 
HNCC. This will allow us to incorporate this as a covariate in our analysis so we can study the 
effect of visits on patients in HNCC vs. those not  in the network. This will also allow us pi[INVESTIGATOR_65286].  
19 
  
We are also requesting permission to receive additional data about our enrolled patients who are 
cared for by [CONTACT_65327]. Specifically, we would like to study their medication adherence (via 
pharmacy claims data), as well as reutilization and adherence to recommended follow -up 
appointments.  
 
We are requesting informed consent be waived to allow us to collect a few key data 
elements from the charts on patients w e are unable to enroll.  For these unenrolled patients, 
demographic data such as race and insurance status will be drawn from the electroni c patient 
registration system.  Home address will be recorded simply to obtain their census tract of 
residence, and t hen their address will be deleted, along with any HIPAA information (eg dates), 
from the database.  Census tract demographics will then be used to compare additional 
demographics between enrolled and unenrolled patients. Re -admission and l ength of stay of both 
enrolled and unenrolled patients will be determined by [CONTACT_65328].  
Prospective outcome data (ED visit or admission) for both enrolled and unenrolled patients will 
be determined through automated searches of the CCHMC billing datab ase and HealthBridge 
data.  We believe that this approach is no more intrusive than  a retrospective chart review would 
be or than a retrosp ective look at our unenrolled population. Mostly import antly, it will help 
ensure our findings are due to the home visit.  
 
Post-Hoc Analysis  
Qualitative Analysis:  
An open -ended semi structured question guide will be developed by [CONTACT_65329]. The interview and focus group questions are designed to 
stimulate and engage the participants to respond in their own words and to extract what is most 
meaningful to them. A copy of sample questions, representative of the questions in the individual 
interviews and focus groups is attached to the IRB. Interviews  will last approximately [ADDRESS_71094] approxima tely 60 minutes. We will ensure confidentiality of 
participants’ responses, including asking participants to protect the confidentiality of responses 
made by [CONTACT_2312]. All focus groups and interviews will be attended by [CONTACT_65330], 
one will ask q uestions and take notes the second will be responsible for additional note taking. 
The focus groups and interviews will be audio -taped and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts will 
be stripped of identifiers and reviewed for accuracy  
 
 
DATA ANALYSIS/METHODS  
Aim [ADDRESS_71095], and qual itative methods expert to identify 
emerging concepts and themes related to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65287], experiences, and preferences. The 
different disciplines/training of team members allows for multiple perspectives and prevents the 
perspective of one researche r from biasing data interpretation. A multidisciplinary team also 
enhances the credibility and dependability of the interpretation of the results.  
During the initial phase of coding, analysis will begin with the independent review of one 
transcript. The t eam will meet to discuss the transcript and to identify initial ideas, concepts, and 
[ADDRESS_71096] member checking, whereby [CONTACT_65331] a set of parents or caregivers who participated in the focus group s. In another 
effort at triangulation, our findings will also be reviewed with several home -visiting nurses and 
pediatricians. The purpose of these reviews is to verify the findings and to identify any 
inconsistencies with stakeholders and participants. In  addition to using a multidisciplinary team 
of researchers, this data review process represents an additional step to enhance the credibility of 
the interpretation of the data.40,41  
 
Themes will be used to refine the intervention for the implementation phase (Aim 2) to better 
address the needs of families. Themes about experiences and preferences will be identified and 
used to develop measures of patient - and family -centered outcomes that  will be assessed during 
the randomized controlled trial (Aim 3).  
 
Aim 2  
For both the home visits and the phone calls, w e will evaluate the effects of adaptations on 
measures using statistical process control (SPC) methods. SPC is an analytic method originating 
in industrial engineering for assessment of the control of a process within targeted parameters. In 
this proposal,  the a priori core measures will be tracked and plotted graphically in time series 
fashion using run and Shewart (control) charts. We will assess the stability of each measure by 
[CONTACT_65332] 20 visits prior to adaptation and will u se SPC principles to 
determine when a change in the home visit process leads to a meaningful change in the 
measures, known as special cause variation.42,43 The graphical nature of SPC makes it ideal for 
the evaluation of frequent changes in a process; in contrast to traditional pre -post intervention 
analyses which are based on data aggregat ion (such as average values), SPC displays individual 
data points for maximum visualization of variation over time. Further, SPC provides immediate 
feedback as data is collected regarding the effectiveness of adaptations to meet desired goals. 
The steps of  analysis include 1) evaluation of baseline data for each of the three core measures; 
2) establishment of control limits to help determine when a change in the intervention results in a 
meaningful change in measures; 3) weekly sequential plotting of visit -level data; and 4) weekly 
evaluation by [CONTACT_65333][INVESTIGATOR_65288].  
 
Aim 3  
 
All primary analyses will include the intent to treat population.  
 
21 
 Working hypothesis 1 : Patients who re ceive the nurse home visit intervention will have a 
significantly lower occurrence of any all cause rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ED/urgent care revisit, and/or 
unscheduled follow -up within [ADDRESS_71097] -discharge. The dependent variable will be a dichotomized 
indicator of any occurrence of rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ED revisit, and/or unscheduled follow -up within 
30-days post -discharge. Differences in this outcome between intervention and  control groups 
will be evaluated using logistic regression with the stratification variable (presence or absence of 
underlying chronic condition and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65289]. surgical service) included in 
the model to account for the sampling desig n.  
 
Working hypothesis 2 : Patients who receive the nurse home visit intervention will have 
significantly higher parent activation scores 14-days post -discharge when compared to the 
patients enrolled in the control group after [ADDRESS_71098] analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) usi ng a linear model containing a trea tment effect indicator.  P arent al 
activation scores will be checked for normality and data transformations will be entertained, if 
needed.  Baseline differences will be examined between groups, again using a linear model.   If, 
by [CONTACT_17793], there is a difference between the groups, the first analysis will be repeated but 
adding the baseline as a covariate.  
 
The sample size was determined based on the comparisons between the control group (standard -
of-care) and interven tion group (nurse home visit) for the primary outcome measure, a 
dichotomized indicator of all cause reutilization (i.e., rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ED revisit, or 
unscheduled follow -up) within [ADDRESS_71099] -discharge, and the secondary outcome measure, 
parent acti vation score. A sample size of 1500  patients and their families ([ADDRESS_71100] -of-care 
and 600 nurse home visits) was chosen to balance precision and feasibility. Assuming the control 
group primary outcome rate is 0.20, this sample size allows detectable di fferences of 0.07 or 
more (a 35% reduction or more from the control group rate) with 80% power. This detectable 
difference is lower than differences found in prior studies of adults. The estimated utilization rate 
of 0.[ADDRESS_71101] service 
readmission rates of 5% on the general service and 15% on the surgical service, a 10% ED revisit 
rate, and a 4% outpatient service utilization rate; we assume that 10% of enrolled patients will 
come from the sur gical service.  
 
In all cases, secondary analyses will be performed including potential covariates, which may 
affect the impact of the intervention. We will look at the association between both the dependent 
variable of interest and the potential covariate/confounder and b etween the intervention and the 
potential covariate or confounder. Those associated with either the dependent variable or the 
intervention at p<0.[ADDRESS_71102] elimination will be used, 
variables significant at p<0.05 and those involved in confounding (i.e., if elimination from the 
model changes the beta coefficient for the intervention by [CONTACT_726] 10%) will be retained in the 
model. Variables considered as potential covariates are patient age, parent or caregiver age,  
education, marital status, household income, employment status, and access to primary care.  
 
22 
 Additional secondary analyses of the reutilization rate will exclude unforeseen readmissions for 
newly developed conditions not related to known diseases during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. In 
addition to the intent to treat analysis, a per -protocol analysis will also be employed.  
Analysis of secondary outcomes identified through Aim 1 will be tailored to the outcome 
measure. For example, if parents or caregivers i dentify days of work missed as an important 
outcome, our analysis of days of work missed will be restricted to only those parents/caregivers 
reporting work outside the home. We will take a two -part approach to analysis. First, we will 
treat it as a binary outcome, comparing the percentage of caregivers that missed at least one day 
of work during the 30 -day follow -up period between the two study arms using logistic 
regression. Second, we will treat the number of days of work missed as a count outcome and use  
poisson regression to compare the two study arms. No interim analysis is planned.  
 
Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects:  
We have multiple planned analyses to examine potential heterogeneity of treatment effect of the 
nurse visit. Factors included in the HE T analysis are insurance, primary care access, financial 
strain, caregiver education, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65273], and medical complexity.  Medical complexity will 
be determined by [CONTACT_65316] (PMCA). The PMCA is a publicly 
available al gorithm that identifies children with complex chronic disease (who have accessed 
tertiary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422]) . The algorithm includes three levels of medical complexity: children with 
complex chronic disease (C -CD), children with non -complex chronic disease (NC -CD), and 
children without chronic disease (CD).   In order to calculate the PMCA we will collect additional 
administrative data for all patients enrolled in Aims 3 and 4.  This data will include: ICD9 
Codes /ICD10 codes , procedure codes, admission date , discharge  dates, admitting and d ischarge  
departments . We will capture all outpatient, urgent care, ED, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65274] (February 1, 2012 to April 30, 2016). The PMCA will be calculated based 
on a 3 -year window before the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
 
Aim 4  
 
Analyses: For the primary outcome, the dependent variable will be a dichotomized indicator of 
any occurrence of healthcare reutilization within [ADDRESS_71103] poverty and discharge service unit included in the model. Other 
potential covariates (e.g. baseline characteristics with large differences between groups) will be 
included in a secondary analysis model evaluating the ef fectiveness of the phone intervention. 
For secondary outcomes, PDCS total score and number of days back to normal routine perceived 
by [CONTACT_65334] [ADDRESS_71104] poverty and discharge service unit and other potential covariates included in the 
model.  
 
Sample size: Assuming a 20% reutilization rate in the control group, a sample size o f 750 in the 
control group and 450 in the phone intervention group will achieve 80% power to detect a 7.1% 
decrease in reutilization rate (12.9% event rate) for the phone call intervention group with 
alpha=0.05, allowing for 11% noncompliance.  
 
23 
 For our se condary outcomes, allowing for 11% noncompliance and 5% attrition, the sample size 
will achieve 80% power to detect a mean difference of 3.[ADDRESS_71105] deviation of 16 points for bot h groups. The 
sample size will achieve 80% power to detect a mean difference of 0.[ADDRESS_71106]-Hoc Analysis  
Qualitat ive Analysis:  
The team will meet to discuss the interviews and identify  ideas , concepts, and theme s of the 
interviews . Weekly meetings will be held until the completion of the interviews  allowing for 
ongoing scrutiny and feedback about the interpretation o f the data. Interview and focus group 
transcripts will be de -identified and reviewed by [CONTACT_65335]. The investigators and lead CRC will meet on a regular basis to discuss 
the transcripts, and will define and organize themes in an iterative fashion. The results of these 
interviews  and focus groups  will provide a deeper understanding of our results.   
 
Readmission Analysis:  
We will compare the percentage of readmissions desi gnated as potentially preventable in those 
patients randomized to the intervention in Aim [ADDRESS_71107] protection.  In order to facilitate follow -up within the 
confines of the study, the database information will not be de -identified.  However, any future 
projects utilizing this database would be approved under separate IRB protocol and could be 
restricted to de -identified data.  Families may feel uncomfortable answering certain questions in 
the focus groups or the questionnaires, but they can always choose no t to answer those questions. 
We will also ask that other focus group participants keep the information confidential. Data 
24 
 received from HealthBridge will be sent in a secure manner and data will be stored following the 
same procedures listed above.  
 
RISK/ BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
While immediate benefits to any given individual are unlikely, and the longer -term benefits of 
improving the nurse home visits are unclear, this study involves minimal risk to the individuals 
recruited.  The primary risk is of breach of co nfidentiality. This will be mitigated by [CONTACT_65336]. However, we believe that the study has a favorable risk/benefit 
tradeoff.  It is also possible that patients and families who receive the nurse home visits  or phone 
calls will find them helpful in understanding the child’s illness or how to manage the condition at 
home.  
 
Similarly, we believe the minimal risk to unenrolled patients’ privacy of using the electronic 
registration database to determine demographic and length -of-stay data,  and performing the 
automated search of the CCHMC billing database to determine the primary and secondary 
outcomes warrants waiving informed consent for these patients.  Data on the unenrolled patients 
will allow us to comment on whether or not our enrolle d sample is systematically different from 
those we did not enroll.  We believe our potential results will be best utilized to improve care if 
any limits to their generalizability are elucidated.  We believe the benefit to the potential impact 
of the resear ch findings significantly outweighs the minimal risk to the privacy of unenrolled 
patients of recording data available via registration and billing databases.  
 
RESPONSE PROCECURES FOR HARDSHIP AND SERIOUS EVENTS  
If the caregiver, at any time during the re search encounter requests assistance with any 
challenge or hardship,  we will notify the inpatient social worker with the family’s 
permission . This will occur within 24 hours and could be generated by [CONTACT_65337] . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_65290].  
 
In the unlikely event that a family member volunteers thinking about a serious adverse event, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_65291]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_65292] (if available) will assist in triage 
including the use of [ADDRESS_71108] of 
the nurse home visits are covered under the grant and by [CONTACT_7105]. In Aim 1,  families that 
25 
 participate in the focus groups will receive a $ [ADDRESS_71109], as well as be provided food and 
beverages at the focus groups.  In Aim 2,  families that receive a phone call  to assess the visit  will 
receive a $[ADDRESS_71110] upon completion of the survey.  Families that complete a nurse phone call 
feedback call will be paid $10 as well. In Aims 3 and 4 , families that complete the survey during 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65293] a $ [ADDRESS_71111] upon completion of the survey, and another $ [ADDRESS_71112] ete the interview will receive 
$[ADDRESS_71113] upon completion of the interview, they can participate without receiving payment.

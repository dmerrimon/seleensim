15complete .  At least 2 completers per weight cohort
should not be taking concomitant endothelin receptor 
antagonists ( ERAs).Phase of Development:  1b/2
Length of Study:   Period1: 10weeks (approximately 35 days at each dose level)
  Period2: Open -Label Extension (OLE): a minimum of 2 years
Objectives:
Primary Objective:
To characterize the pharmacokinetics ( PK)of tadalafil in a pediatric population with pulmonary arterial 
hypertensio n (PAH )to establish an appropriate dose range for further clinical research .
Secondary Objectives:
To assess the tolerability and safety of tadalafil in a pediatric population with PAH.
To compare tadalafil PK profile in a pediatric population with historical adult data from Study 
H6D -MC -LVGY.
To determine appropriate dose ranges for use in the evaluation of efficacy and safety of tadalafil.
To clinically assess the palatability of the tadalafil suspension.
Open -Label Extension Objective s (Period 2):
To evaluate long
-term safety while providing continued access to tadalafil for pediatric patients 
completing Period1.
To evaluate clinical worsening (CW), defined as any of the followin g:death, lung or heart 
transplantation, atrial septostomy or Potts shunt, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_491521], new onset 
syncope, initiation of new PAH therapy , or increase of 1 or more in World Health Organization (WHO )
Functional Class (except for pat ients already in Class IV) only for patients unable to perform the 6 minute 
walk (6MW )test; worsening of WHO functional class by [ADDRESS_632179] a decrease of ≥20% in the 6 minute walk distance (for those pat ients who are ≥6 years 
of age).
To evaluate the cardiopulmonary hemodynamic changes from baseline (Period 1) to end of 3 month 
treatment in Period 2 as assessed by [CONTACT_51541].
Study Design:   Study LVIG is a Phase 1b/2, multicenter, international, open -label, multiple ascending-dose study 
to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of tadalafil administered orally as a tablet or suspension to children 
with PAH .  Eligible patients will be f rom 6months to <18yearsof age at time of screening .  This study contains 
2study periods: PK/safety ( Period 1) and an OLE ( Period 2).  Each patient may continue in Period2for at least 
2years after participating in Period 1.

Study Drug, Dosage, and Mode of Administration :
Tadalafil will be administered orally in an open -label fashion .  The dose of tadalafil will be escalated from low to 
high for each patient.  For each weight cohort these 2 doses of tadalafil aredetermined by [CONTACT_491536] 2.5 to 10 mgand 20 to 40mgin adults .  
However, all of the initial doses are open to subsequent alteration based on emerging safety and PK analyses 
throughout the study.   Although the oral route of administration is commonly used for dosing medicinal products 
to pediatric patients, it is acknowledged that children, especially the younger age groups, may require an age -
appropriate formulation. Therefore, a ready -to-use oral suspensio n containing 2.0 mg/mL tadalafil wi ll be used for 
the Light -weight cohorts <25 kg, nomin ally representing patients <8 years of age.
Tadalafil tablets ; 2.5 mg, 5mg, 10mg, 20mg, and 40 mg(that is , two 20 mgtablets); orally; once daily.
Oral suspension formulation (2.0 mg/mL) ; 1mgand 5mg; orally; once daily .
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 6
LY450190Reference Therapy/Comparator ,Dose, and Mode of Administration: Not Applicable
Planned Duration of Treatment:   Tadalafil will be administered once -daily  for [ADDRESS_632182] 2 years.
Variables
Safety :Safety will be evaluated using spontaneously reported adverse events, clinical laboratory data, vital signs, 
physical examinations, body weight, height, WHO functional class, IQ, Tanner score, and centralized 12 -lead 
electrocardiograms ( ECGs) as outlined i n the schedule of events.
Bioanaly tical:Plasma concentrations of tadalafil.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic :The pharmacokinetic parameters estimated during analy sis willinclude area 
under the concentration -time curve (AUC), maximal concentration (C max), time of Cmax(tmax), apparent clearance 
(CL/F) ,apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F), and terminal half -life (t½) , as appropriate.
Explo ratory : Analy ses of hemodynamic data will utilize the following variables:  tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion, eccentricity index, pericardial effusion, maximal tricuspid regurgitant velocity .    
Health Outcomes: Not applicable .
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 7
LY450190Statistical Evaluation Methods:
Statistical: All enrolled patients who take at least [ADDRESS_632183] eval uable PK data will be 
included in the PK analysis .  All enrolled patients who take study medication will be included in the safety 
analy sis.
Sample Size: No formal statistical analysis was performed to determine the sample size for this study .  In 
order to have at least 5 completers in each weight cohort, approximately 8 patients per weight cohort for a total 
of up to approximately 24may need to be enrolled, assuming a drop -out rate of approximately 30%.  Tadalafil 
plasma concentrations from at least 5 completers per weight cohort are considered to be sufficient to 
characterize the PK of tadalafil in pediatric patients .  Furthermore, safety and tolerability data from these 
patients will provide information to support the dose selection for the efficacy Stud y H6D -MC -LVHV.
Period 1:All enrolled patients w ho take at least [ADDRESS_632184] evaluable PK data will be 
included in the PK and the safety analy sis.  Prior to an individual patient being dose -escalated, the safety and 
PK data will be reviewed to assess the suitability of dose escalation.
Noncompartmental Pharmacokinetic Analyses: Evaluation of individual profiles during the study will be based 
on PK parameter estimates calculated by [CONTACT_483181] .  The purpose of th ese analyses 
will be to evaluate dose escalations in individual patients, and to evaluate (as data become available) the 
appropriateness of the starting doses .  The primary parameters for this evaluation will be area under the curve 
of concentration versus time (AUC) and Cmax.  Other noncompartmental parameters may be reported if 
appropriate .
Population Pharmacokinetic (PopPK) Analysis: The purpose of the PopPK analysis is to characterize tadalafil 
PK across the range of body weights and ages of patients en rolled in the study and in each cohort; to evaluate 
the effect of various covariates such as age, body weight, sex, and endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) use 
on tadalafil exposure; and to predict appropriate dose(s) in subsequent pediatric studies of tadalafil.
After [ADDRESS_632185] completed Period 1 and prior to the Light -weight cohort patients 
enrolling into the study, the results o f an interim analysis will be reviewed by a safety monitoring committee 
(SMC) .  The SMC will review all available study data and recommend proposed tadalafil dose levels for the 
Light -weight cohort .  A compartmental analysis of the concentration versus tim e data may also be performed 
to support PK simulations.
Safety parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_491537].  Additional analyses will be performed if warranted by [CONTACT_82229] .  Safety parameters that will be 
assessed include adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAE) , safety lab parameters, ECGs, body 
weight, height, and vital signs.
Period 2:All patients who take study medication will be included in the long - term safety analysis .  Changes 
from baseline to endpoint in hemodynamic parameters collected by[CONTACT_491538] .  
Patients will be pooled and analyzed as a single treatment group .  No formal statistical testing will be 
conducted and only summary sta tistics will be presented.
Safety will be assessed through TEAEs , SAEs , body weight, height, WHO functional class, IQ, Tanner score, 
and reason for discontinuation.

Pharmacokinetics and Safety  in a Pediatric Population with

5.Introduction
5.1. General Introduction
Pulmo nary arterial  hypertensio n (PAH) is a rare, chronic, and progressive disease characterized 
by [CONTACT_491542], leading to right 
heart failure and death ( Rich 19 98; Barst 2004 ).  Pulmo nary arteri al hypertensio n can be further 
classified into i diopathi c PAH (IPAH), heri table PAH (FPAH), and associated PAH (APAH) .  
Condi tions that are associated with PAH include connect ive tissue diseases, congenital heart 
disease, portal  hypertensio n, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)infect ion, schistosomiasis 
and so me drugs (particularly anorexigens) .
The pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis and management of PAH in children is similar to that 
in adults, though li ttle research h as been conducted in the pediatric populat ion.  The prevalence 
and incidence of PAH is significant ly lower in children than in adult s (Rubin 1997 ); ithas been 
estimated that about 0.5 per millio n children will be diagnosed with IPAH which accounts for 
about 50% of all pediatric PAH .  The Registry to EValuate Early And Long-term PAH Di sease 
Management (REVEAL Registry ), a m ulticenter, observat ional, [LOCATION_002] -
(US-) based 
registry created to provide the characteristics and treatment patterns of patients with PAH, 
recent ly reported just 184 prevalent pediatric cases among 54 enrolling centers in the US 
(Barst 2008).  The sex ratio between female and male is approximately 2:1 in childhood 
(Badesch et al. 2010 ) and m edian survival in children <16 years, prior to the introducti on of  
specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371468], was ≤6months (D’Alo nzo et al. 1991; Barst et al. 1999 ).
While sildenafil and bosentan have recent ly had l anguage added to their labels pertaining to the 
pediatric popul ation, there remain limit ed da ta on the safet y and efficacy of the approved adult 
treatm ents in a pedi atric popul ation.Therapeutic guidelines for children have therefore generally
followed those used in adults .  Therapi [INVESTIGATOR_491523] s, 
in various geographi es around the worl d, include prostacyclin and its analogues (epoprosteno l, 
trepostinil, iloprost, and beraprost), the endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan and
ambrisentan), and the phosphodiesterase ty pe-5 (PDE -5) inhibitors (sildenafil a nd tadal afil).
Tadal afil is an orally administered, potent, and selective PDE -
5inhibitor currently approved in 
the [LOCATION_002], European Unio n, Canada and in Japan for the treatment of erectile dysfunct ion 
(ED), both on -demand (at doses of 5 mg, 10mgand 20 mg) and once- daily  (at doses of 2.5 mg
and 5 mg), and for the treatm ent of pulmo nary arteri al hypertensio n (PAH) (at a dose of 40 mg 
daily) .
In adults, tadalafil is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_89385], with maximum concentrations 
(Cmax) in pla sma occurring at a median t ime of 2 hours .  The rate and extent of absorption from 
tadal afil 10mgand 20 mgare not i nfluenced by [CONTACT_8208] .  Tadalafil is distributed into tissues, with 
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 19
LY450190an apparent volume of distribution o f 62.6 L .  Tadalafil is cleared extens ively, with metabo lism 
by [CONTACT_161770] e P450 (CYP) 3A4 being the major pathway .  The m ean terminal eliminat ion half -
life (t ½) for tadal afil is 17.[ADDRESS_632199] asma 
concentrations were attained within about 5 days and the degree of drug accumulat ion was about 
1.6-fold.  A tadalafil 40 mgsingle dose i s rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24584], with Cmaxin plasma occurring at a 
median time of 4 hours , and within the range of that reported following a 20 mgsingle dose.  
Following tadal afil 40mgonce -daily, the apparent clearance at steady  state (CL ss/F) and 
accumulat ion rati os rem ained stati onary  between Day 5 and Day 10.  I ncreas es in both C maxand 
area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC )areless than proportional as the dose 
increases fro m 20mgto 40 mg.  Specifically, d ue to decrease
d bioavailabilit y with 40mgonce -
daily  doses com pared to l ower doses, a 2 -fold cha nge in dose from 20 mgto 40 mgresul ts in a 
48% increase in exposure .
The safet y and efficacy  of tadalafil for the treatment of PAH in adults was invest igated in a 
16-week pl acebo -controlled study  (Study  H6D -MC-LVGY [LVGY] ) which demonstrated that, 
overal l, tadal afil 40mgonce -daily  dosing was effective in the treatment of patients with PAH 
and was associated with an increase in exercise capabilit y.  
Tadal afil 40mgwas well tol erated in 
the adult PAH pati ent popul ation with a safet y profile similar to th at observed in the erectile 
dysfunct ion pat ient populat ion.  Populat ion pharmacokinet ic (PopPK )data from Study  LVGY 
show that exposure to tadalafil is not influenced by [CONTACT_654], cardiovascular condit ions, sex, ethnicit y, 
PAH history  or durati on, creatinine clearance (CC) , total  serum  protein, wei ght, warfarin, or 
digoxin, thereby  [CONTACT_491543] .  
Concomitant bosentan therapy increased the apparent oral clearance o f tadal afil by 75%, 
resul ting in a 35% decrease in exposure in pat ients receiving 40 mgtadal afil.  In pati ents wi th 
PAH not recei ving conco mitant bosentan, the predicted median tadalafil exposure at steady -state 
was 26% higher when compared to that in healthy vo lunteers.  There were no clinically relevant 
differences in mean Cmaxcompared to healthy vo lunteers.  The results suggest a potentially lower 
mean clearance o f tadal afil in pat ients with PAH com pared to heal thy volunteers.
An aqueous, ready -to-use suspensio n for oral  administrati on of  2.0mg/mL tadal afil has been 
developed for use in y ounger children .  A rel ative bioavailabilit y study  (Study  H6D -MC-LVIF
[LVIF] ) has been performed in healt hy adult s to i nvestigate the relative bioavailabilit y of one 
20mgtablet com pared to a suspension containing 20 mgtadal afil.  Study  LVIF also assessed the 
pharmacokinet ics of the tadalafil s uspensi on over the 20 mgto 40mgdose range .  The results 
from Study  LVIF dem onstrated that the 20 mgsuspensio n produced a 23% lower Cmaxfor 
tadal afil and significant del ay intime o f maximum observed concentration (tmax)of 1hour 
compared to the 20mgtablet .  However, o verall exposure to tadalafil was similar for the 20mg
suspension and tablet, with the 90% confidence interval s for the rati os falling wit hin the 
bioequivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25.  Exposure to tadalafil during the absorption/distri bution 
phase is lower for the 20 mgsuspensio n compared to the 20mgtablet, wi th AUC (0-6)and 
AUC (0-12)being 25% and 16% lower .  Results indicated a less -than-dose-proporti onal increase in 
tadal afil exposure over the 20mgto 40mgdose range for the suspension formulat ion.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 20
LY450190Given the efficacy and safet y resul ts of tadal afil for the treatment of PAH in adults (Study  
LVGY), and recognizing the importance of providing prescribers and pat ients with 
recommendat ions reflecting tadalafil e xperi ence across devel opmental  stages, Lilly is pursuing 
the development of tadalafil for the treatment of PAH in pat ients ≥6months of age to <[ADDRESS_632200] igator’s Brochure (IB).
5.2. Rationale and Justification for the Study
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_491524] h an approved indication in children, there is a growing body  of 
evidence support ingthe use of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_409224]-label 
usein children (Beghetti  2009 ) .  Therefore, there is a need to provide physicians wit h safety  and 
efficacy  resul ts of all treatm ent opti ons, incl uding tadal afil, in the pediatri c popul ation.
Beyond anecdotal  reports, experience wit h tadalafil ex posure in pediatric patients does not exist, 
other than that in a single 14 -year-old female patient (73 kg) who received tadalafil 2.[ADDRESS_632201] igated further in a larger safet y and

time of screening.  Thi s study  contains 2study  periods: PK/safety ( Period1) and an open -label
safet y extensi on(OLE )
(Period2).  Approximately 24 patients may be entered into this study to 
ensure that a minimum o f 15patients ( at least 5 in each body -weight cohort, of which ≥[ADDRESS_632203] [ERA ]PAH t herapy and ≥
3are treated with 
ERA) complete the planned progression through low and high doses of tadalafil when taking into 
consideration ant icipated pati ent drop -out rates .  Of the [ADDRESS_632204] 3 patients will be 
≤[ADDRESS_632205] 2patients will be ≤2 years of age.  Peri od1 is approximately 
10weeks ( that is, approximately 5 consecut ive weeks for each dose [low and high])

The body -
weight cohorts are defined as:
Heavy: ≥40kg
Middle: ≥25kg to <40 kg
Light: <25kg
Dosing o f all weight co horts is described in Table LVIG. 9.1.  Tadal afil doses were selected to 
mimic ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_491526] h PAH (Study  LVGY) .  
The He avy-weight

a.New onset syncope.
b.Addit ion of new PAH specific conco mitant therapy  including but not 
restri cted to epoprostenol or treprostinil, sildenafil, vardenafil, or increase in

d.Worsening of WHO functional class and a decrease of 20% in the 6MW test 
for those pati ents who are ≥6years of age and are developmentally capable of 
performing the 6MW test .
7.2. Discussion of Design and Control
The p harmacokinet ics of tadal afil in pediatric subjects have not been explored .  This study  is a 
multiple ascending- dose study  with dosing predicted to approximate the exposures seen 
previously in adults wit h PAH (Study  LVGY) .  In Peri od 1, t adalafil will be administered a t
2dose l evels over [ADDRESS_632212] s (that is, bosentan or ambrisentan) will be permitted, while conco mitant use 
of prostacy clin and its analogue s, and o f another PDE -5inhibitor will be contraindicated in 
Period 1.  Adult patients with PAH who were receiving conco mitant bosentan had decreased 
tadal afil plasma exposure; therefore, Study  LVIG will  enroll  at least 6 subj ects (2 per wei ght 
cohort) not receiving bosentan.
The concomitant use of another PDE -5inhibitor ( for example , sildenafil )or soluble guanylate 
cyclase st imulator (for example, riociguat) is prohibited during the study .  Subjects receiving 
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_632213] 24 hours prior to 
the baseline visit (Visit 2), which should suffice to allow for sy stemic eliminat ion of the PDE -5
inhibitor ( that is, at least 5 half -lives of the drug).
As the characteri zation of the pharmacokinet ics of tadalafil is the primary objective of the study , 
an open -label design is considered appropriate.
7.3. Determination of Sample Size
No formal stati stical analysis was performed to determine the sample size for this study .  The 
sample size is primarily chosen to provide adequate data to characterize the PK of tadalafil in a 
pediatric popul ation and to determine the dose selection for the efficacy  Study  LVHV.
Tadal afil plasma concentrations from at least [ADDRESS_632214] 5 completers in each 
weight cohort, approximately 8 patients per weight cohort for a total of up to approximately 
24may need to be enro lled, assuming a drop -out rate of approximately  30% .  Safet y and 
tolerabilit y data fro m these patients will provide informat ion to support the dose select ion for the 
efficacy  Study  LVHV .  If a patient is terminated after the Day 49 PK sample co llection, this 
patient will be defin ed as a com pleter and replacement will not occur .
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_632215] ing condit ions will be 
docum ented.
Screening may occur up to 28 days prior to enrollment.

8.2. Discontinuation
8.2.1. Discontinuation Procedures
The nature of any condit ions, clinical signs or symptoms, or abnormal laboratory  values present 
at the time of discont inuat ion and any applicable follow -up procedures will be documented.
8.2.2. Discontinuation of Individual Patients
The cri teria for enrollment m ust be fo llowed explici tly.  If the invest igator site ident ifies a patient 
who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was inadvertent ly enro lled, the sponsor must be 
notified.  If the sp onsor i dentifies a pat ient who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was 
inadvertent ly enro lled, the invest igator site will be notified.  A discussio n must occur between 
the Lilly  clinical  pharmacol ogist or clinical research physician and the invest igator to determine 
whether the patient may  cont inue in the study , with or wi thout invest igational product.   
Inadvertent ly enro lled patients may be maintained in the study and on invest igational product 
when the invest igator and Lilly clinical pharmaco logist o r clinical research physician agree it is 
medically appropriate for that patient .  The pati ent may not continue in the study  with or wi thout 
investigat ional product if the Lilly  clinical  pharmacol ogist or clinical research physician does not 
agree wi th theinvest igator’s determinat ion that it is m edically appropriate for the patientto 
continue.  The invest igator must obtain documented approval fro m the Lilly clinical 
pharmaco logist or clinical research physician to allow the inadvertent ly enrolled pat ient to 
continue in the study  with or wi thout invest igational product.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Early Discontinuation from Study
Some possible reasons for early  discontinuat ion of study participation:
Enrollment in any other clinical trial invo lving an off -label use of an 
investigat ional drug or devi ce or enrollment in any other ty pe of m edical  research 
judged not to be scient ifically or medically co mpatible with this study.
If Exclusio n Cri terion [18], [19], [20], [22 through 28], [3 2], [36] , or[37] is 
observed, or develops, after entry  or enrollment .  In this case, the patient will be 
discontinued fro m the drug/study  at the next visit or sooner in the event of a 
safet y exclusi on cri terion.
oExcept ion: A pat ient receiving an ERA who develops an AST or ALT >[ADDRESS_632220] ments and monitoring that are consistent with the adult 
recommendat ions in the respective ERA labels.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 31
LY450190The Investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn .  If this decisio n is 
made becaus e of a SAE or a clinically significant laboratory  value, the study  drug 
is to be discont inued and appropriate measures are to be taken .  Lilly or its 
designee is to be alerted immediately .  For further informat ion, please refer to 
Secti on10.4, Safet y Evaluat ions.
The patient, the patient’s legal guardian, or the attending physician requests that 
the pati ent be wi thdrawn from  the study .
In Peri od1, the patient, for any  reason, requires treatment with another 
therapeuti c agent that has been demo nstrated to be effect ive for treatm ent of the 
study  indicat ion.  In this case, discontinuation from the study occurs prior to 
introducti on of  the new agent.
Patients experiencing clinical worsening in Period 1 (as defined in Sect ion 
[IP_ADDRESS] ) will be discont inued fro m the study  and receive standard of care . Patients 
in Period 2experiencing cli nical  worsening (as defined in S ection [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be 
managed at the discreti on of  the invest igator; howev er, the patient m ay continue 
in the study .
The Investigator or Lilly stops the study  or stops the patient’s participat ion in the 
study  for medical, safet y, regul atory , or other reasons consistent with applicable 
laws, regulations, and good clinical practic e.
The invest igator determines that the patient is repeatedly nonco mpliant with study  
procedures and/or study  drug.
If the patient experiences priapi[INVESTIGATOR_491529] m the 
study  
Patients who discont inue the study will have an ea rly terminati on visi t perf ormed at 
the time o f the pati ent’s study  discontinuati on, or at the earliest possible date .  This 
early  terminat ion visit will be used to collect as many data/samples as practical fro m 
the pati ent.  The early terminat ion data/samp le co llections will be the same as those 
collected at end of Week 10 of Period1, or the final visit of Period2, depending on 
the timing of discont inuat ion.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Termination of the Dose Escalation
Dose escalat ion within each weight cohort will be based upon on going review of safet y, 
tolerabilit y data, and pharmacokinet ic analyses .  
The following cri teria will be emplo yed to 
determine if dose escalation is appropriate:
If ANY of the following criteria are met, the patient should not have their dose escalated .
Dose levels may be repeated or reduced, if required, to better ident ify thresho lds for 
tolerabilit y.
Severe Adverse Events:
A pat ient experiences an SAE related to study  drug.
Priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801] (discont inue pat ient per Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] ).

Symptom atic postural hypotension considered related to study  drug.
Nonarteri tic Anteri or Ischemic Opt icNeuropathy  (NAION) and related terms.
Hearing loss and related terms.
In the event of an SAE related to study  drug, other than precaut ionary inpatient observat ion, 
dosing will be suspended for the patient pending notification o f the ethical review board ( ERB)
and appropriate regulatory  authori ties.  Do sing will only resume after the ERB, invest igator, and 
Sponsor agree on the appropriateness of further dosing.
Shoul d an individual pat ient meet eitherof the PK cri teria below on Day 1orDay 14, then the 
patient may  not increase to the high dose level.
Pharmacokinet ic Result s:
An observed tadalafil Cmaxexceeds the meanCmaxof 700 ng/mL measured 
during 40mgonce -daily dosing to adul t pati ents wi th PAH (Study  LVGY) .
An AUC (0 -24) exceeds the meanAUC ( 0-24) of 13,700 ng hr/mL measured
during 40mgonce -daily dosing to adul t pati ents wi th PAH (Study  LVGY) .
8.2.3. Discontinuation of Study Sites
Study  site parti cipat ion may be discont inued if Lilly, t he invest igator, or the ERB of the study  
sitejudges it necessary for any  reason.
8.2.4. Discontinuation of the Study
The study  will be di scontinued if Lilly or its designee judges it necessary  for any  reason.   
Addit ionally , the study  may be discont inued at the recommendat ion of the Safet y Moni toring

LY4501909.Treatment
9.1. Ration ale for Selection of Dose
In Period1, it is planned that tadalafil once -daily  doses will ini tially be administered as pre -
defined fixed doses 
(Table LVIG. 9.1) selected to mimic ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_491530] 2.5mgto 40 mg.  However, all o f these init ial doses are open to alteration based on 
emerging safet y and PK analyses throughout the study .  
Each cohort will begin wit h the l ower of 
2doses and escalate to the high dose following approximately 5 week s at the l ower dose level .  
Pharmacokinet ic samples will be co llected per the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ) such that 
these data (in addit ion to safet y and tol erabili ty data) will be available prior to planned dose 
escalat ion, thus allowing the opportunit y to refine any individual’s dose progression.
At the beginning of Period2, the dose may vary depending on weight cohort and tolerabilit yfor 
each individual from Period 1.  During Period 2, the dose for each patient might be adjusted per 
SMC recommendat ion as more safet y and efficacy informat ion beco me available during this 
study or the efficacy Study  LVHV .  
For the first 3months of Period 2the target dose will deliver 
a tadal afil exposure equivalent to that seen wit h [ADDRESS_632221] 3months of 
Period 
2the dose may then be increased (as judged by [CONTACT_3170]), but will not exceed the 
maximum weight range dose established in Period 1.

IQ, and Tanner score will also be co llected in Period 2 as defined in the Study  Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ).  Tadalafil concentrations and protocol clinical laboratory  data will be co llected 
for pati ents when reporting a n SAE.
10.4.1. Safety Measures
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly  or its designee to any  event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the pati ent.
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study.
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, 
AEs that are serious or that caused the patient to di scontinue before complet ing the study .  The 
patient shoul d be f ollowed unt il the event is reso lved or explained.  Frequency o f follow-up 
evaluat ion is left to the discret ion of the investigator.
In addit ion to records of observat ions made at specific times, unexpected signs and symptoms 
and conco mitant m edicati ons will be recorded in the clinical trial records throughout the study .  
Further routine medical assessments may  take pl ace during the study  as clinically indicated .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physical Examination
Physica l examinat ions and routine medical assessments will be conducted as specified in the 
Study  Schedule and as clinically  indicated (Attachment 1 ).  Physical examinat ions will include 
an eye examinat ion.  In addit ion, Tanner Stage will be assessed at the time of specified in 
Protocol  Attachm ent 1 .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs
Blood pressure and heart rate (HR) will be measured as specified in the Study  Schedule and as 
clinically indicated ( see Attachment 1 andAttachment 5 ).  After the init ial or subsequent 
increase in tadalafil dose, blood pressure and HR will be measured at [ADDRESS_632233] igator .  Unscheduled orthostatic vital signs should be assessed, if 
possible, during any AE of dizziness or posture -induced symptoms .  Addit ional vital signs may  
be also be measured if clinically indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Body Weight and Height
Body  weight and height will be recorded as specified in the Study Schedule and as clinically 
indicated (Attachment 1 ).
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 41
LY45019010.4.1.4. Electrocardiograms
Twelve -lead ECGs will be obtained according to the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 ).  Addit ional 
ECGs m ay be obtained during each study  period if warranted.
Ele
ctrocardi ogram swill be interpreted by  a qualified physician (the investigator or qualified 
designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the 
patient is st ill present, for immediate patient management and to determine whether the patient 
meets entry  criteria.  If the ECG shows a clinically important change, then the investigator 
shoul d assess if the patient can continue in the study .
The ECGs will subsequently be electronically  transmi tted to the centralized E CG vendor 
designated by  [CONTACT_491550] .  Some or all  ECGs may  be over read by  a medically -qualified 
professio nal (for example ,cardi ologist) to assess clinically  significant findings on the automated 
ECG readings .  Should an over read occur, the rationa le and strategy  for cardi ologist assessment 
of ECG abnormalit ies will be documented in the final study  report.
If an over read ECG is returned fro m the centralized ECG vendor, the invest igator or qualified 
designee is responsible to determine if any change to the subject’s management is needed and 
must docum ent his/her review by [CONTACT_491551] .  Any clinically 
significant findings that result in a diagnosis should be recorded on the case report form (CRF) .  
Any clinically  significant f indings that do not result in a diagnosis should be commented on and 
appropriately  docum ented.
If there are differences in ECG interpretation between the invest igator or qualified designee and 
the ECG vendor cardio logist, the invest igator or qualified desi gnee's interpretation will prevail 
for study  entry  and immediate subject management purposes, and the ECG vendor cardiologist's 
interpretati on will  prevail  for data analysis purposes.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Special Procedure
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Eye Examination
Eye examinat ionswill be performed according to the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 ).  The 
examinat ion includes pat ient medical  history , external eye examinat ion and retinal examinat ion
using an ophthalmo scope.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Inhibin Monitoring
Inhibin B mo nitoring will be collected accordi ng to the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ) from all 
male pa tients.  In patients below the age of 9 years, this will be an exploratory  assessment .
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Intellectual Ability and Cognitive Functioning Assessment
The patient’ s intellectual  abilit y (intelligence quotient; IQ) will be assessed at Visit 2 (prior to 
first dose of study  drug), and after 1 y ear and 2 years fo llowing treatm ent ini tiation.  The 
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children –Fourth Edit ion (WISC -IV) i s the preferred instrument 
for IQ assessment. Due to age restrict ions of the WISC -IV, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
Scale®-Fourth Edition (WAIS -IV®) and Wechsler Preschool and Primary  Scale of Intelligence 
Test (WPPSI -III) may also be used as detailed below . Patients may be assessed with a different 
scale at subsequent visits depending on their age.

Blood Pressure Collection Protocol
According to the American Heart Associat ion (AHA) blood pressure is most conveniently 
measured in chi ldren by  [CONTACT_409286] a standard mercury  sphygm omanometer.  
Therefore, the invest igation sites will be encouraged to use this method rather than automated 
devices .  An exception is allowed in the case o f young infants in whom auscultation is difficult 
and in intensive care settings where frequent measurements are needed.
Correct blood pressure measurement in children requires a cuff which is appropriate for the size 
of the child’s upper arm .  This will require a cuff bladder that covers 80% of the 100% of the 
circumference of the arm .  Thus the recommended size for infants is 6 ×12 cm  and the 
recommended size for older children is 9× [ADDRESS_632257] igator .
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_632258]
(modified fro m Am J Respir Crit Care Med . 2002;166:111 -117).
The test should be conducted along a long, flat, enclosed corridor with a hard surface that is 
seldom traveled
.  If weather permits, the test may be conducted outdoors .  The corridor must be 
as qui et as possible while the test is underway to minimize external interference .  The distance 
that the patient has to walk before changing directions is [ADDRESS_632259] .  The length of the corridor should be 
marked every  3 meters and turnaround points should be marked with a bright ly colored cone .  A 
starting line, which marks the beginning and end of each 60 -meter lap, shoul d be mar ked on the 
floor wi th brightly co lored tape.
1) Before starti ng the test, record all pertinent information surrounding the test, 
i.e., starting locat ion, length of hallway, direct ion the subject will be walking, 
time of test, patient’s general condit ion/feeling on the day  of the test, and any 
other physical or medical informat ion that m ay potent ially influence the 
resul ts of the test.
2) Instruct the patient as fo llows:
“The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for [ADDRESS_632260]  without hesi tation.  No w I’m going to show you.  Please 
watch the w ay I turn wi thout hesi tation.”
(Dem onstrate by  [CONTACT_409287] l ap yourself .  Wal k and pi[INVESTIGATOR_113988] a cone briskly.)
“Are y ou ready  to do that? I am going to use this counter to keep track of the number 
of laps y ou com plete .  I will click it each t ime you turn around at this starting line .  
Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE for 6 minutes , but don’t 
run or jog.
Start now, or whenever y ou are ready .”
3) Have the pat ient stand at the starting po int.  Simultaneously, give the patient a 
signal to start wal king as quickly  as possible, record the start time, and 
continue timing for the 6 -minute period.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_632261] 
phrases of encouragement .  Watch the patient .  Do not get distracted and lose count of the laps .  
Each time the participant returns to the starting line, click the lap counter once (or mark the lap 
on the worksheet) .  Let the participant see you do it.  Exaggerate the click using body  language, 
like using a s topwatch at a race.
After the first minute, tell the patient the fo llowing (in even tones): “You are doing well .  You 
have 5 minutes to go.”
When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the patient the fo llowing: “Keep up the good 
work .  You have 4 minut esto go.”
When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the fo llowing: “You are doing well .  
You are halfway done.”
When the timer shows 2 minutes remaining, tell the patient the fo llowing: “Keep up the good 
work .  You have only 2 minutes left.”
When the timer shows 1 minute remaining, tell the patient: “You are doing well .  You have only  
1 minute to go.”
Do not use other words of encouragement (or body language to speed up).
If the patient stops walking during the test and needs a rest, s ay this: “You can lean against the 
wall if y ou woul d like: then continue walking whenever y ou feel able.” Do not stop the timer .  If 
the pati ent stops before the 6 minutes are up and refuses to continue (or y ou deci de that they  
shoul d not continue), wheel the chai r over f or the pati ent to si t on, di scont inue the walk, and note 
on the worksheet the distance, the time stopped, and the reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_224687].
When the timer is 15 seconds fro m completion, say  this: “In a m oment I’m  going to tell y ou to
stop.  When I do, just stop right where you are and I will co me to y ou.”
When the timing of the [ADDRESS_632262] marks that location.
Once the pat ient’s final location has been marked, allow the patient to leave the test course.
Measure the distance fro m the starting point tothe final locat ion and calculate the distance 
walked as foll ows:
Distance walked = (number of “laps” completed) x (length of 1 “lap” in meters) + (distance of 
any partial lap).
Record the distance walked by  [CONTACT_11346].

Protocol A mendment H6D-MC-LVIG(d )Summary  
A Multiple A scending Dose Study  of Tadalafil to A ssess 
thePharmacokinetics and Safety  in a Pediatric Population 
with Pulmonary  Arterial Hy pertension
Overview
Protocol  H6D -MC-LVIG, A Mult iple Ascending Dose Study  of Tadalafil to Assess the 
Pharmacokinet ics and Safet y in a Pediatric Populatio n with Pulm onary  Arterial Hypertensio n,
has been amended.  The new protocol is indicated by  [CONTACT_11827]( d) and will be used to conduct 
the study  in place of any preceding versio n of the protocol .
The overall changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are as follows:
The wo r
ding in the S ummary of Study Design (Section 7.1) has been changed to provide the 
minimum number of completers ≤6 years of age and the minimum number of completers 
≤2years of age; the maximum number that was included in the previous versio n of the 
protocol (“ but not more than 4 patients ” and “ but not more than 3 patients ,” respectively ) has 
been deleted.
  This modification will leverage the potential additional patient enrollment in 
this age group to better understand the PK and safety.
Guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat, were added as concomitant medicines that 
are excluded and should prevent a pati ent from enrolling in the study.  The combination of 
guanylate cyclase stimulators and tadalafil could suddenly cause a drop in blood pressure 
which may result in dizziness or fainting.  Therefore, e xclusion criterion [37] has been added 
to exclude any patients who are taking guanylate cyclase stimulators , such as riociguat.  Also, 
riociguat was added to Section
 9.6(Concomitant Therapy ) as a concomitant medicine that 
would prevent a pati ent from enrolling in the study.
Text in Section 8.2.2 (Discontinuation of Individual Patients) has been changed to align with 
the current required language related to criteria for enrollment required per Lilly SEQS /MQS .
Text in the footnote section of the Study Schedule (Attachment 1 ) has been modified for 
clarification of the beginning of Period 2.
Corrected typos and clarified various other minor items in the protocol.

Note: All deletions have been ident ified by [CONTACT_58001] .
All additions have been ident ified by [CONTACT_58002] .
The numbering system used for inclusio n and exclusion criteria provides a unique number for
each cri terion and all ows f or efficiency in data collection.
In case an amendment to the protocol adds a criterion, that criterion will receive the next 
available number, regardless of whether it is an inclusio n or excl usion cri terion.
Minor ty pographical /grammat icalerrors were corrected throughout the protocol.
Abbreviat ions were defined throughout the protocol.
2.Synopsis
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion andExclusion
Patients are not eligible to be included in the study if they  meet any  ofthe following exclusio n 
criteriaexclusion criteria :
[14]  Concurrent PDE -5 inhibitor therapy ( such as sildenafil or vardenafil) or has received PDE -
5inhibitor therapy  within [ADDRESS_632263] study  drug dosing ( baseline visit).
[
23]  Have sever e renal  insufficiency, defined as receiving renal dialysis or having a measured or 
estimated creatinine clearance (CC) 30mL/min/1.73 m2(Schwartz Formula):
All Females and Pre -adolescent Males:
Ccr (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 0.55 × Height (cm) / SCr (mg/dL)
Adolescent Mal es:
Ccr (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 0.70 × Height (cm) / SCr (mg/dL)
Where C cris Creatinine Clearance and S Cris Serum Creat inine

7.1.  Summary of Study Design
…  Of the [ADDRESS_632264] 3 , but not more than 4 patients will  be ≤[ADDRESS_632265] 2 , but not more than 3 patients will  be ≤2 years of age.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 67
LY4501907.2.  Discussion of De sign and Control
…  The concomitant use of another PDE -5inhibit or (for example , sildenafil ) or soluble 
guanylate cy clase st imulator (for example, riociguat) is prohibited during the study .  Subjects 
receiving another PDE -5inhibitor will be required to discont inue the medicat ion at l east 
24hours prior to the baseline visit (Visit 2), which should suffice to allow for sy stemic 
eliminat ion of the PDE -5inhibitor ( that is, at least 5 half -lives of the drug).
8.1.2.  Exclusio n Criteria
[14]  Concurrent PDE -5 inhibitor therapy ( such as sildenafil or vardenafil) or has received PDE -
5inhibitor therapy  within [ADDRESS_632266] study  drug dosing ( baseline visit).
[23]  Have severe renal insufficiency, defined as recei ving renal  dialysis or having a measured or 
estimated creatinine clearance (CC) 30mL/min/1.73 m2(Schwartz Formula):
All Females and Pre -adolescent Males :
Ccr(mL/min/1.73 m2) = 0.55 ×Height (cm ) / S Cr(mg/dL)

Where C cris Creatinine Clearance and S Cris Serum Creat inine
[37]  Currently receiving treatment with soluble guanylate cy clase st imulator therapy  (such as 
riociguat).   Exclusio n criteria [37] has been added.
8.1.3 .  Rationale for Inclusion and Exclusion of Certain Study Candidates
Exclusio n criteria and [30], [3 1], and [35] are in place to prevent a previously enro lled patient 
from re-entering the study  that m ay have al ready  had study  medicat ion.  Thi s woul d confound 
the analysis.
Exclusio n criteria [32] isin place to assure that the patients can take the medicat ion in the forms 
that are available in this trial.
Exclusio n criteria [33] and [3 4] are in place to prevent possible study  bias from  close relati ons.
Exclusio n criteria [37] is in place to protect the patient since the combinat ion of PDE5 inhibitors 
and guanylate cy clase stimulators, such as riociguat may lead to symptomat ic hypotension.
8.2.[ADDRESS_632267] be fo llowed explici tly.  If a pati ent who does not meet 
enrollment criteria is inadvertent ly enro lled, that patient is discont inued fro m the study , and Lilly  
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_632268] igator’s determinat ion that it is m edically appropriate for the patientto 
continue.  The invest igator must obtain documented approval fro m the Lilly clinical 
pharmaco logist or clinical research physician to allow the inadvertent ly enrolled pat ient to 
continue in the study  with or wi thout invest igational product.
[IP_ADDRESS] .  Early Discontinuation from Study
If Exclusio n Cri terion [18], [19], [20], [22 through 28], [3 2], or [36], or [37] is 
observed, or develops, after entry  or enrollment .  In this case, the patient will be 
discontinued fro m the drug/study  at the next visit or sooner in the event of a 
safet y exclusi on cri terion.
oExcept ion: A patient receiving an ERA who develops an AST or ALT >[ADDRESS_632269] ion of this protocol (see Section8.1.2 ), such as:
Prostacy clin or i ts anal ogues.
Concurrent PDE -5 inhibitor (other than study medication)
Nitrates
Doxazosin or Other cancer chemotherapy
Antiretrovi ral therapy (protease inhibitors), systemic ketoconazole, or sy stemic 
itracon azole.
Potent sy stemic CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers
Guanylate cy clase st imulators, such as riociguat

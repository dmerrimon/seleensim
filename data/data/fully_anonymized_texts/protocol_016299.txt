1.  Background and Significance  
 
a) Historical background  
 
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease  in 
the [LOCATION_002] , with an estimated prevalence of approximately 30% [1]. NAFLD is a disease 
with a spectrum that can be categorized as 1) simple steatosis/non -alcoholic fatty liver, defined 
as excess liver fat without inflammation, and 2) non -alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in which 
excess liver fat is associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and healing, ultimately culminating in 
cirrhosis [2]. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can progress to conditions associated with 
high mo rbidity and mortality such as portal hypertension, cirrhosis, liver failure and 
hepatocellular carcinoma [3]. NASH is currently the second most common indication for li ver 
transplantation in the [LOCATION_002], and is expected to become the  leading cause  in the near 
future [4-6]. 
 
Liver biopsy is currently accepted as the gold -standard method to detect liver fibrosis, though it 
is an invasive procedure with high morbidity and mortality rates. Alternatively, imaging is useful 
for NAFLD diagno sis, disease management, and monitoring treatment response. Several 
imaging methods are used for these purposes, including ultrasound, MRI, and CT based 
techniques. Ultrasound (US) is preferred by [CONTACT_611669] a low -cost technique 
that is widely available. Shear wave elastography (SWE) is an ultrasound -based technique that 
is commonly used for liver fibrosis staging [7]. When performing ultrasound imaging, i t is known 
that several patient -related factors  may influence the quality of the image.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 3 of 17 In NAFLD patients, several factors including high skin -to-liver capsule distance (SCD) may 
change the attenuation and aberration of the acoustic waves, change the quality of the image, 
and make diagnosis harder for radiologists. SCD is the distance between skin and Glisson’s 
capsule, when assessed with standard B -mode ultrasou nd imaging [8-13]. In patients with high 
SCD, and particularly in patients with abdominal obesity, the shear wave elasticity elastogram 
box may not fill properly, which may cause unreliable SWE measurements, as shown in Figure 
1. Technical failur e and unreliable SWE measurements have been previously reported [14, 15] . 
 
The current FDA guidelines recommend the use of a maximum derated spatial peak temporal 
average intensity (I SPTA) of ≤ 720 mW/cm2, and either the maximum MI should be  ≤ 1.9 or the 
maximum derated spatial peak pulse average intensity (I SPPA) should be ≤ 190 W/cm2 [16].  In 
addition, clinical justification is required if the TI exceeds 6. Several diagnostic modes that are 
clinically used and FDA approved [7, 17, 18]  use acoustic output values that approach these 
maximum guidelines. These diagnostic modes include acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) 
based techniques, harmonic imaging techniques, and Dopple r based techniques.   In the past 
decade, the AIUM has published reports on the benefits and limitations of both the TI and 
MI[19-21], including recommendations that transient increases may be warrant ed if there were 
associated clinical benefit [19, 21] . 
 
Using the acoustic and thermal limits in current FDA guidelines, it is not always possible to get 
reliable SWE measurements. Therefore, conditionally increasing t he acoustic pressure of a SWE 
system may help clinicians to obtain reliable and accurate SWE results from patients with 
abdominal obesity, potentially minimizing the need for liver biopsy.  
 
In this study, we aim to assess possible bioeffects that may be c aused by [CONTACT_611670] (CIO). Bioeffects will be monitored by [CONTACT_4007] a 
series of liver function tests (LFTs) with results graded according to the NCI scale for drug 
hepatoxicity. LFTs will be collected pri or to SWE imaging using CIO, as well up to [ADDRESS_811108]

Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 5 of 17 (SCD), our aim is to conditionally increase the acoustic pressure (CIO) of a SWE system to help 
clinicians obtain accurate SWE results in obese patients. We aim to reduce the need for 
monitoring hepatic fibrosis  and steatosis  using liver biopsy, as it is and costly, invasive with high 
morbidity and mortality rates, and is subject to sampling error.  
 
2. Specific Aims and Objectives  
 
Aim 1: Ascertain if hepatic bioeffects occur when increasing acoustic output above FDA limits for 
SWE  imaging.   
 
Aim 2: Determine if SWE  image quality improves when using increased acoustic output.  
 
Aim 3: Quantify the effect of phase aberration on SWE tra cking.  
 
Hypothesis: Increased acoustic output will improve SWE  image quality without causing hepatic 
bioeffects.  
 
3. General Description of Study Design  
 
This is a  prospective  pre/post  single arm non -inferiority study  to show that the increase  in liver 
function tests following increased acoustic output SWE  is not more than two standard 
deviations .

standard fashion.  The consent form will be signed electronically using RedCap by [CONTACT_611673]/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 7 of 17 and physician prior to initiation of any study procedures. We will not target non -English 
speaking subjects.  
 
6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
a) Study visits and procedures  
 
Each subject will be asked to participate for a period of approximately [ADDRESS_811109]  1 screening visit, 4 study visits , and 1 phone follow up visit .  
 
Prior to study visits:  
Eligibility via telephone will be confirmed and informed consent documentation as well as study 
visit appointment details will be shared by [CONTACT_611674] -secure email. Within 24 hours prior to the study 
visit, volunteers will be asked the MGH COVID -19 symptom survey (or applicable MGB COVID 
preventions procedures should they change) to confirm absence of symptoms.  
 
Screening  Visit:  
The screening visit is expected to take approximately 60 minutes. The study team will obtain 
written informed consent to participate and will then obtain  participant demographics, 
anthropomorphics, medications, alcohol intake, and brief medical history  to assess liver -related 
diagnoses . The participant will undergo blood sampling , 10 mL or less  (1-2 specimen 
container (s) – less than 90mL) , to assess liver function tests [ including  alanine transaminase 
(ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosph atase (ALP)] and serum bHCG level for 
postmenarchal and premenopausal women who have not undergone surgical sterilization 
(tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or hysterectomy. Subjects with liver function testing 
values greater than 3x the laboratory upper limit of normal or with a positive serum pregnancy 
test will not undergo increased acoustic output imaging or follow up liver function testing.   
 
Study Visit 1:  
The first study visit  is expected to take approximately  [ADDRESS_811110] SWE exam consists of 10 diagnostic elastography measurements in the 
right lobe of the liver via an intercostal window du ring suspended respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. If non -diagnostic 
values are obtained, repeat acquisitions are attempted up to a total of 20 imaging attempts.  For 
increased acoustic output, the operator will set the  mechanical index  (MI) value of 2.9, [ADDRESS_811111] clinical B -mode ultrasound images (within FDA energy deposition limits) 
will be obtained while capturing r aw RF data.  
 
Study Visits 2, 3, 4:

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.[ADDRESS_811112] ing of 10mL or less (1 specimen container – less than 90mL)  
for liver function testing 1 day after visit 1, 2 days after visit 1, and 7 days after visit 1.   
 
Phone Follow Up  Visit:  
Within [ADDRESS_811113] subjects by [CONTACT_611675] a final questionnaire (to be completed by [CONTACT_464]) to obtain information 
regarding alcohol consumption , change in medical history , and adverse events .  
 
b)    Devices and imaging procedures  
 
A commercial curved abdominal ultrasound probe GE C1 -6 will be used. The software version of 
the device will be R2.5.2NeatG . An MI of 2.9 will be used for CIO.   
 
Staff will assess the probe’s individual channel sensitivity profile to ensure adequate 
functionality using the electronic probe assessment tool (E -PAT).  E -PAT testing will be  
performed 1) after imaging each subject and 2) at least once within [ADDRESS_811114] (if not already performed), including the initial sub ject. Additional testing may be 
performed if there are any concerns of probe malfunction (i.e. accidental probe drop).

d) Result Reporting  
 
Liver function testing results will be accessible to subjects through patient gateway. Subjects 
will be contact[CONTACT_611676] 3x the laboratory upper limit of 
normal.  Positive pregnancy testing will be reported to subjects.  
 
The results of the SWE exams are not planned to be shared as the interpretation of the SWE  
values requires clinical correlation . Furthermore, exams may be performed by [CONTACT_611677]. As a 
result, image quality may not meet clinical standards which may reduce the reliability of SWE 
results.  Results from increased acoustic output SWE will not be released as this technique is 
experimental and the results have not been corre lated with histopathology.  
 
e) Incidental Findings  
 
Should incidental findings, imaging or otherwise, of perceived clinical significance be identified, 
the research team will contact [CONTACT_611678]. Permission to contact 
[CONTACT_423]’s primary care physician will be obtained prior to communicating results for 
continuity of care.  
 
f)    Study Termination Criteria  
 
Subjects with  baseline  liver function testing values greater than 3x the laboratory upper limit of 
normal or with a pos itive serum pregnancy test will not undergo increased acoustic output 
imaging or follow up liver function testing.  We will attempt to contact [CONTACT_105] -responding subjects 
for a period of 4 weeks after enrollment, at which point, they will be deemed ‘lost to fol low up’.  
 
g) Remuneration  
 
Following the completion of Study Visits  1, 2, 3, and 4, as well as the follow -up phone call, subjects 
will receive  $[ADDRESS_811116] using the Advarra participant payment system, divided into  the 
following increments, given after each visit :

h) External Data Sharing  
 
De-identified laboratory, clinical, and imaging data will be shared with the study sponsor via the 
MGH S ecure File Transfer service.  
 
7. Risks and Discomforts  
 
a) Complications of surgical and non -surgical procedures.  
 
Conventional u ltrasound is painless , non -invasive,  and does not require the administration of 
ionizing or X -ray radiation.  Subjects may experience minor discomfort from needing to remain 
still, the pressure of the ultrasound probe, or the need for repeated breath holding.  
 
The risks associated with elevat ed MI ultrasonic imaging include thermal and non -thermal 
bioeffects.  Non -thermal risks associated with elevated MI imaging are related to the potential 
for inducing cavitation. A recent AIUM report concluded that exceeding the recommended 
maximum MI given in the FDA guidance (i.e., 1.9), up to an estimated in situ (effective MI, MIE) 
value of 4.0, could be justified without concern for increased risk of cavitation in tissues with out 
gas bodies if there were a clinical benefit [21]. Since there are no endogenous sources of air in 
the liver, and these studies will be performed on patients that have not had ultrasound contrast 
agent in the previous 24 hours,  and because the m easured MI values will be kept ≤ 3.0  - which, 
conservatively, should keep the  in situ value, MIE,  ≤ 4.0, the potential for cavitation is very 
small. If, however, it were  to occur, the likely impact of the resulting tissue damage would be 
limited given the large mass of the liver relative to the small volume of the insonated tissue. 
Thus, it is unlikely that clinically significant liver damage would result, if any at all.   
 
Blood sampling requires needle placement into a peripheral vein which is likely to cause brief 
minor pain. A small bruise may result. The small volume of blood obtained during the study is 
unlikely to be of clinical consequence.  
 
b) Drug side effects and to xicities  
 
Not applicable  
 
c) Device complications/malfunctions  
 
The images acquired in this study will not be used for clinical decision making; thus, any acquired 
images with suboptimal image quality should not otherwise affect patient care.  Malfunctioning 
channel elements may reduce image quality, however the malfunction would be expected to lead 
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.[ADDRESS_811119], and thus less risk of tissue injury, which is already 
considered low.  Significant complications from perip heral venous blood sampling would be 
unusual.  
 
d) Psychosocial (non -medical) risks  
 
There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality, however strict measures are followed to maintain 
confidentiality. The data being acquired and analyzed is not considered sensitive.  
 
e) Radiation Risks (statement provided by [CONTACT_611679])  
 
Ionizing radiation is not used for this study.  
 
f) Risk Reduction  
 
Energy levels selected for increased acoustic output SWE acquisition are based on prior human 
study and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_611664]. The target study population will be selected 
such that subjects are of generally good health and would be expected to tolerate small amounts 
of liver damage were it to occur without catastrophic consequen ces. Subjects will be carefully 
screened and excluded if active/ongoing significant liver injury is present to prevent the additive 
effects of the investigational technology. Pregnant women are excluded from this study as the 
risks to an embryo or fetus fr om increased acoustic output ultrasound are unknown.  Subjects will 
be carefully monitored throughout the study with serial lab testing to assess early and late 
hepatic effects from increased acoustic output SWE. Subjects will be enrolled in EPIC in order t o 
capture unanticipated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_611665]. Frequent E -PAT 
testing will be performed to identify probe malfunctions at the channel level.  Such hardware 
failures would result in a pause to enrollment while hardware rep air or replacement occurred in 
order to maximize image quality and scientific benefit from each subject. Such a malfunction is 
not expected to increase risk as energy deposition is expected to be lower.  
 
8. Benefits  
 
There are no expected direct benefits to the subjects participating in the study. Liver biopsy, 
the current gold standard test to assess fibrosis is imperfect, costly, invasive, and subject to 
sampling error. The imaging strategy that will be evaluated, increased output SWE , has the 
potential to reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for the diagnosis and monitoring of 
hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Patients, particularly those who are obese,  may potentially 
benefit in the future by [CONTACT_7661] a  better  non-invasive test to stage their liver fibrosis  and thus, 
may be spared more invasive testing . 
 
9. Statistical Analysis  
 
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.[ADDRESS_811120] which are associated with liver injury are used in 
our study [22]. 
 
Alanine transaminase (ALT).  ALT is an enzyme found in the liver that helps convert proteins 
into energy for the liver cells. When the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the bloodstream 
and levels increase. The normal limit for ALT at MGH is 7 to 55 U/L [23, 24 ]. The standard 
deviation for ALT is 12 U/L [23, 24] . 
 
Aspartate transaminase (AST).  AST is an enzyme that helps metabolize amino acids. Like ALT, 
AST is nor mally present in blood at low levels. An increase in AST levels may indicate liver 
damage, disease or muscle damage. The normal limit for AST at MGH is 10 to 40 U/L. The 
standard deviation for AST is 7.5 U/L.  
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP).  ALP is an enzyme fo und in the liver and bone and is important for 
breaking down proteins. Higher -than -normal levels of ALP may indicate liver damage or 
disease, such as a blocked bile duct, or certain bone diseases. The normal limit for ALP at MGH 
is 45 to 115 U/L. The stand ard deviation for ALP is 17.5 U/L.  
 
The power calculations shown below are based on paired non-inferiority testing  assuming no 
mean difference between pre and post imaging liver function tests and a non -inferiority margin 
of 1σ (1/2 upper limit of normal) with alpha = 0.05 , target power = 0.9 , and an  assumed 
dropout rate of 25%[25]. For compariso n, many drug trial use 5x the upper limit of normal as 
the criteria for drug hepatotoxicity. Our non -inferiority margin has been selected to be much 
more stringent given that ultrasound is an otherwise noninvasive diagnostic test.

MGB study investigators and staff will have access to study  files. Data shared with collaborators 
will not include identifiable information. Confidentiality of subjects will be strictly protected. 
The investigators will comply with the human subject investigation guidelines of [LOCATION_005] 
General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
 
b) Safet y monitoring  
 
Safety monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_611681] ; the PI [INVESTIGATOR_611667]. Subject safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_611682]. Subject safe ty will be monitored from the time 
each subject signs the Informed Consent Form until completion of study participation. Subjects 
will have available the contact [CONTACT_611683]. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_133203] 24 hours of potential adverse events  
including any laboratory value outside of the normal range .  
 
c) Outcomes monitoring  
 
Any possible bioeffects that may be caused by [CONTACT_611684] (LFT) , with results graded according to the NCI scale for drug 
hepatoxicity  (grade 1 = 1 -3x upper limit of normal; grade 2 = 3 -5x upp er limit of normal; grade 3 
= 5-20x upper limit of normal; grade 4 = >20x upper limit of normal) . Participants will attend 
study visits to obtain blood samples collected [ADDRESS_811122] -scanning  to trend liver fun ction tests and assess laboratory value normalization.  
 
d) Adverse event reporting guidelines  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_611668]. 
Subjects will be evaluated for signs of pain and discomfort before, during, and immediately 
after the study visit. Any significant adverse event will be reported to the IRB and followed up 
by [CONTACT_5984].  
 
All Adverse Events, Serious adverse events, Adverse Device Effects, and Device Deficiencies will 
be collected at the time of reporting by [CONTACT_611685]. They 
will be source documented and maintained as part of the study r ecord.   
 
An assessment of the following metrics will be made by [CONTACT_611686]:   
• severity,  
• seriousness,  
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 14 of 17 • anticipated or unanticipated,  
• relation to study participation or investigational imaging technique , 
• action taken,  
• outcome (resolution, sequelae, etc.)  
Definition of adverse events (AE) in this study will be ‘’any untoward or unfavorable 
medical occurrence in a human subject, includ ing any abnormal physical exam or 
certain unexpected abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with a subject's participation in the research’’.  
 
Definition of serious adverse events (SAE) in this study:  
A SAE is any AE that:   
Results in death, or  
Is life -threatening, or  
Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or  
Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacitation, or  
May jeopardize the participant's health and may require medic al or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. No SAEs are 
anticipated in this study.  
 
All AEs will have their relationship to study procedures assessed by [CONTACT_978]. The following criteria 
will be used to identify causality; (0) Not related, (1) Unlikely to be related, (2) Potentially 
related, (3) Probably related, (4) Definitely related. PI [INVESTIGATOR_248629] (AE) is expected or unexpected in this study. An AE will be 
considered unexp ected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
known ultrasound risks and complications, which are very limited. The occurrence of an AE or 
SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during ultrasound scans. Any medic al 
condition that is present at the time that the participant is included will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant's condition deteriorates 
at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
The following will be reported in the case report forms for each Device Deficiency 
that occurs:  
• device ID,  
• device event description,  
• date of deficiency,  
• whether the deficiency caused or could have caused an Adverse Device Effect to 
occur.  
 
The disposition of all safety events, assignment of relatedness, and determination of 
seriousness is the responsibility of the Investigator. All Adverse Events will be reported in the

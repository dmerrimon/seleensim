Internal Use Only Medical and Scientific Affairs  Primary endpoints:  
The primary endpoints for this study are sotorasib PK parameters on Days 1 and 9: maximum 
observed plasma concentration (C max), area under the plasma concentration -time curve from 
time zero to infinity (AUC inf), and area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 
zero to time of last quantifiable concentration (AU Clast). 
Secondary endpoints:  
The secondary endpoints for this study are adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead 
electrocardiograms, and vital signs.  
Statistical methods:  
The primary PK parameters are C max, AUC last, and AUC inf for sotorasib on D ays [ADDRESS_544683]. Geometric mean 
ratios for C max and AUC values and associated 90  confiden ce intervals (Test/Reference) will 
be estimated. The “Reference” treatment for PK analysis will be sotorasib administered alone 
with water, while the “Test” treatment will be omeprazole  coadministered with sotorasib and  
an acidic beverage . 
 
The number and percentage of subjects reporting any adverse events will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_237079]. Tables of 
fatal adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to withdrawal from 
investigational product or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and significant treatment -
emergent adverse events will also be provided. Subject -level data may be provided instead of 
tables if the subject incidence is low. Endpoints for clinical laboratory te sts, 
electrocardiograms, and vital signs will be summarized.

1.1. Backgro und 
Investigational Medicinal Product  
The role of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) gene mutations in human 
cancers has been known for decades;[ADDRESS_544690] been successfully developed. Thus, an unmet need exists for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_430639]. Recent progress in the field suggests that 
1 mutant version of KRAS, KRAS p.G12C , which encodes the KRASG12C protein, might be 
tractable for small -molecule inhibition through a covalent interaction with the cysteine.3,4,5 
KRAS  p.G12C  mutation is a frequent mutation found in approximately 13  of lung 
adenocarcinoma (nonsquamous, non -small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]), 3  of colorectal cancer, 
and 1 to 2 of numero us other solid tumors.6,7,8 Sotorasib forms a specific covalent bond with 
the cysteine of KRASG12C, irreversibly locking the protein in an inactive conformation that 
cripples oncogenic signaling .5 As inactivation of KRAS has been demonstrated to inhibit cell 
growth and/or promote apoptosis selectively in tumor cells expressing KRAS  mutations ,9,10,11,3,4 
sotorasib may provide a therapeutic benefit for patients with KRAS p.G12C -driven cancers.  
The metabolism and excretion  of [14C]-sotorasib were evaluated in noncannulated male or 
female rats as well as in bile duct cannulated (BDC) male rats after a single oral dose of sotorasib 
(60 mg/kg). Overall, the data indicated that sotorasib was readily absorbed after an oral dose to 
noncannulated male and female rats and BDC male rats, underwent extensive biotransformation, 
and was eliminated primarily by [CONTACT_430648]; 
[14C]-sotorasib -derived radioactivity was excreted primarily through biliary a nd fecal pathways. 
Biotransformation of sotorasib was mediated primarily by [CONTACT_430649], oxidation, and to a lesser extent, reduction, and dealkylation. Secondary sotorasib 
metabolism was substantive and included amide hydrolysis, cysteine -conjugate cleavage, 
N-acetylation, methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfonation. Biotransformation of sotorasib 
through primary glutathione conjugation was major and accounted for up to approximately 
21 to 33 of the dose from intact male and fe male rats, respectively, and up to approximately 
41 of the dose in male BDC rats. Sotorasib metabolites originating from primary oxidation 
account for up to approximately 20  of the dose in noncannulated rats and for approximately 
10 of the dose in BDC rats. Reduction of the sotorasib acrolein moiety account for up to 
approximately 10  of the dose in noncannulated male and female rats and approximately 2.7  
of the dose in BDC rats, whereas dealkylation at the pi[INVESTIGATOR_430640] 10  to 13 of the dose in noncannulated rats and for approximately 6  of the 
dose in BDC rats.

Internal Use Only Medical and Scientific Affairs  The metabolism and excretion of [14C]-sotorasib were evaluated in noncannulated male and 
female dogs after a single oral (500 mg/kg) dose of  sotorasib. Overall, [14C]-sotorasib -derived 
radioactivity was minimally absorbed and was eliminated predominantly as unchanged sotorasib 
in feces following a single 500 mg/kg dose to male or female dogs.  
Eight sotorasib clinical studies (20170543, 2019000 9, 20190135, 20190147, 20190172, 
20190288, 20190436, and 20190442) are currently ongoing in subjects with KRAS 
p.G12C -mutated tumors. In addition, a number of studies in healthy volunteers have explored the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of sotorasib, including ass essments of mass -balance, food -effect, and 
various drug -drug interactions.  
Study 20170543 is an ongoing Phase 1/2, open -label, nonrandomized study evaluating the safety, 
tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of sotorasib in subjects with KRAS 
p.G12C -mutated NSCLC, colorectal cancer, and other solid tumors. As of [ADDRESS_544691] been treated with sotorasib monotherapy across all doses (dose range: 180 to 
960 mg) and tumor types in the ongoing Phase  1 and Phase 2 treatment cohor ts. This includes 
359 subjects who were treated with the sotorasib dose of 960  mg once daily (QD) (fasted) for all 
tumor types.  
For the combination therapy cohorts, as of the data cutoff date (06 July 2020), a total of 
11 subjects with NSCLC were treated w ith sotorasib in combination with pembrolizumab in 
Part 1c/2c of Study  20170543. As of the data cutoff date (12 July 2021), a total of 41  subjects 
with KRAS p.G12C -mutated advanced solid tumors were treated with sotorasib in combination 
with trametinib in Study 20190135 Subprotocol A. As of the data cutoff date (12  July 2021), 
a total of 33 subjects with KRAS p.G12C -mutated advanced NSCLC were treated with sotorasib 
in combination with afatinib in Study 20190135 Subprotocol  D. As of the data cutoff date 
(12 July 2021), 44 subjects with KRAS p.G12C -mutated advanced solid tumors were treated with 
sotorasib and 39 subjects were treated with panitumumab in Study 20190135 Subprotocol  H. 
A summary of completed and ongoing clinical studies for sotorasib is provided  in the IB 
(Tables  6-1, 6-2, and 6 -3).1 In the [LOCATION_002] and several other countries, sotorasib (960  mg 
daily) is currently approved for the treat ment of adult patients with KRAS  p.G12C -mutated 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have received at least [ADDRESS_544692]  
Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) indicated for the treatment of duode nal and gastric 
ulcers, heartburn and other symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis, and long -term treatment of pathological 
hypersecretory conditions (eg, Zollinger -Ellison syndrome, multiple  endocrine adenomas, and 
systemic mastocytosis). Omeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion and thereby [CONTACT_430650], which may alter the absorption of some drugs with pH -dependent 
solubility and cause safety and efficacy con cerns.  Please refer to the [LOCATION_002] Prescribing

Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Drug Development Study: [ADDRESS_544693] been characterized in healthy subjects and in subjects with KRAS 
p.G12C -mutated solid tumors, including NSCLC. Sotorasib exhibited nonlinear, time -dependent, 
PK over the dose range of 180 to 960 mg (0.19 to 1 times  the approved recommended dosage) 
QD with similar systemic exposure (ie, area under the plasma concentration -time curve [AUC] 
from time zero to 24 hours postdose [AUC 0-24h] and maximum observed plasma concentration 
[Cmax]) across doses at steady state. Sot orasib systemic exposure was comparable between 
film-coated tablets and film -coated tablets predispersed in water administered under fasted 
conditions. Sotorasib plasma concentrations reached steady state within 22 days. No 
accumulation was observed after repeat sotorasib dosages with a mean accumulation ratio of 
0.56 (coefficient of variation [CV]: 59 ). 
Absorption  
The median time of the maximum observed concentration (t max) is [ADDRESS_544694] of Food  
When 960 mg sotorasib was administered with a high -fat, high-calorie meal (containing 
approximately 800 to 1000 calories with 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from protein, 
carbohydrate, and fat, respectively) in patients, sotorasib AUC 0-24h increased by 25  compared 
to administration under fasted conditions.  
Distribution  
The sotorasib mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (V ss) is 211 L (CV: 135 ). 
In vitro, sotorasib plasma protein binding is 89 . 
Elimination  
The sotorasib mean terminal elimination half -life is 5 hours (standard deviation: 2). At 960  mg 
sotorasib QD, the sotorasib steady -state apparent clearance is 26.2 L/hr (CV: 76 ). 
Metabolism  
The main metabolic pathways of sotorasib are nonenzymatic conjugation and oxidative 
metabolism with cytochrome P450 (CYP)3As.  
Excretion  
After a single dose of radiolabeled sotorasib, 74  of the dose was recovered in feces (53  
unchanged) and 6  in urine (1  unchanged).

Internal Use Only Medical and Scientific Affairs  Specific Populations  
No clinically meaningful differences in the PK of sotorasib were observed based on age (28  to 
86 years), sex, race ( White, Black, and Asian), body weight (36.8  to 157.9 kg), line of therapy, 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (0,  1), mild and moderate renal impairment (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate:  30 mL/min/1.73  m2), or mild hepatic impairment (aspartate 
amin otransferase [AST] or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]  2.5 x upper limit of normal [ULN] 
or total bilirubin  1.[ADDRESS_544695]). The effect of severe renal impairment or moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment on sotorasib PK has not been studied. Study 20200326 is  currently ongoing 
to evaluate the PK of sotorasib in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  
Drug -drug Interaction Studies  
Interactions of sotorasib with digoxin (P -glycoprotein [P -gp] substrate), metformin (multidrug 
and toxic compound extrusion [MATE]1 and MATE2 -K substrate), itraconazole (CYP3A4 and 
P-gp inhibitor), rifampin (organic anion transporter [OATP] 1B1/1B3 inhibitors and CYP3A4 
inducer), omeprazole (PPI), famotidine (histamine -[ADDRESS_544696]), and midazolam 
(CYP3A4 sub strate) are summarized in the IB (Table 6 -3).[ADDRESS_544697] 
sotorasib may be taken safely with sensitive MATE1/2K substrates, CYP2D 6 substrates, strong 
CYP3A4/P -gp inhibitors, and strong OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitors. However, exposures of P -gp and 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrates may be altered.  
Coadministration of PPIs (such as omeprazole), histamine -2 receptor antagonists, and strong 
CYP3A4 in ducers may lead to decreased sotorasib exposure.  
1.3. Study Rationale  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of omeprazole, a PPI, on sotorasib PK when 
administered orally with  an acidic beverage  (Coca -Cola) and t o evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of sotorasib when coadministered with omeprazole and an acidic beverage  in healthy 
subjects.  
The concomitant use of sotorasib and acid -reducing agents was shown to decrease sotorasib 
exposures. Based on results from S tudy 20190320,[ADDRESS_544698] -square mean ratios 
(test/reference) of sotorasib area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to 
infinity (AUC inf) and C max were 0.582 and 0.431, respectively, when comparing sotorasib 
administered with omeprazole (test) and sotorasib administered alone (reference) in the fasted 
state. In Study 20200199,[ADDRESS_544699] -square mean ratios of sotorasib AUC inf and C max were 
0.622  and 0.654, respectively, when comparing sotorasib coadministered with famotidine (test) 
and sotorasib alone (reference) under fed conditions. Geometric least -square mean ratios of 
sotorasib AUC inf and C max were 0.430  and 0.349, respectively, wh en comparing sotorasib 
coadministered with omeprazole (test) and sotorasib alone (reference) under fed conditions. 
These results suggest that concomitant administration of sotorasib with acid -reducing agents 
should be avoided.

1.4.1.  Therapeutic Context  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Key Benefits  
Healthy subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an 
assessment of their medical status) from  participating in the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Risks  
To limit the risk of excessive exposure to healthy subjects in the current study, subjects will 
receive a single oral dose of 960  mg sotorasib administered as 8  x 120 mg tablets on Day  1, and 
960 mg sotorasib in combinati on with 40  mg omeprazole and an acidic beverage  on Day  9 
(details provided in  Section 3.3). 
Safety monitoring: During the study, subjects will be admi nistered all investigational product 
doses by [CONTACT_430651], chew, or split the sotorasib tablets or 
omeprazole when taking the dose under the supervision of the site staff. Safety assessments 
throughout the study include a dverse event monitoring, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical 
examination, vital signs, and clinical laboratory evaluations.  
Risks of Sotorasib  
Based on sotorasib clinical trials experience, adverse drug reactions with sotorasib include 
diarrhea, nausea, fa tigue, vomiting, abdominal pain, increased liver enzymes, and interstitial lung 
disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. Based on nonclinical toxicity studies of sotorasib, potential safety 
concerns to be monitored in clinical studies of sotorasib include renal toxicity , anemia, and 
leukocytosis. Clinical signs and symptoms of these toxicities observed in clinical and nonclinical 
studies, along with relevant laboratory parameters, will be monitored during the study to ensure 
subjects’ safety.  
Abnormal Liver Function Test s 
Abnormal liver function tests (increased AST and increased ALT) have been observed in 
oncology subjects receiving sotorasib therapy. The events of abnormal liver function blood tests 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Drug Development Study: [ADDRESS_544701], ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and 
bilirubin to be performed. Specific eligibility for sotorasib, including baseline liver function, are 
provided in Section 4. 
Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis  
Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis has occurred in patients treated with sotorasib with prior 
exposure to immunotherapy or radiotherapy. Incidence of ILD in clinical trials was 
approximately 0.8 . All events were serious and Grade 3 or 4 at onset, and 2 subjects 
discontinued sotorasib because of ILD/pneumonitis. During the study, subjects should be 
monitored f or new or worsening pulmonary symptoms. At any grade, immediately withhold 
sotorasib for suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if ILD/pneumonitis is 
confirmed.  
As of [ADDRESS_544702] Risks  
Commonly reported adverse events for omeprazole include headache, abdominal pain, nausea, 
diarrhea, vomiting, and flatulence. Please refer to the package insert for commonly reported 
adverse events for omeprazole.12

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This will be a Phase 1, single -center ([LOCATION_002]), open -label, fixed sequence study to 
investigate the effect of coadministration of omeprazole with an acidic beverage  on the PK of 
sotorasib in healthy male and healthy female subjects. Up to 14 subjects will be enrolled to 
ensure that 12  subjects complete the study.  All subjects will receive each of the following  
treatments:  
 Day 1: 960 mg sotorasib (8  x 120 mg tablets) administered orally with [ADDRESS_544703] 10 hours  
 Days 4 to 8: 40  mg omeprazole (delayed release capsule) administered orally with 
[ADDRESS_544704] 10 hours  
 Day 9: 40 mg omeprazole (delayed release capsule) followed by 960  mg sotorasib 
(8 x 120 mg tablets)  administered orally within [ADDRESS_544705] 10 hours.  
An o verview of the study design is shown in Figure  1.

Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within [ADDRESS_544706] dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the Clinical Research Unit 
(CRU) on Day  -1 and be confined to the CRU until discharge/end  of study (EOS) on Day  11. 
The total duration of study participation for each subject (from Screening through EOS visit) is 
anticipated to be approximately 5.[ADDRESS_544707] signs an Informed Consent 
Form (ICF). The  point of enrollment occurs at the time of subject number allocation. The end of 
the study is defined as the date of the last subject’s last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled).  
A Schedule of Assessments is presented in Appendix  8. 
3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
The fixed sequence design used in this study is typi[INVESTIGATOR_221864] a relatively 
small number of subjects are required. This study  will be open -label because the study endpoints 
are not considered subjective.  
Omeprazole is a well -established PPI [INVESTIGATOR_430641].  
The proposed regimen for omeprazole in this study is to take omeprazole alone QD fo r [ADDRESS_544708] because the inhibition of acid secre tion increases with repeated QD 
dosing, reaching a plateau after 4 days.12 
Conducting the study in healthy subjects mitigates the potential confoundi ng effects of the 
disease state and concomitant medications.

Labcorp Drug Development Study: [ADDRESS_544717] is withdrawn from dosing, the Sponsor (or designee) will be notified and the date and 
reason(s) for the withdrawal will be documented in the subject’s electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF). If a subject is withdrawn, efforts will be made to perform all EOS assessments, if 
possible ( Appendix  8). Other procedures may be performed at t he Investigator’s (or designee’s) 
and/or Sponsor’s discretion. If the subject is in -house, these procedures should be performed 
before the subject is discharged from the clinic. The Investigator (or designee) may also request 
that the subject return for an  additional follow -up visit. All withdrawn subjects will be followed 
until resolution of all their adverse events, or until the unresolved adverse events are judged by 
[CONTACT_737] (or designee) to have stabilized.  
Subjects who are withdrawn for reason s not related to study drug may be replaced following 
discussion between the Investigator and the Sponsor. Subjects withdrawn as a result of adverse 
events/serious adverse events thought to be related to the study drug will generally not be 
replaced.  
4.6. Study  Termination  
The Sponsor may stop the study or study site participation in the study for medical, safety, 
regulatory, administrative, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and 
Good Clinical Practice. Both the Sponsor and the Inves tigator reserve the right to terminate the 
Investigator's participation in the study according to the Clinical Trial Agreement. The 
Investigator is to notify the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in writing of the study's completion 
or early termination and  send a copy of the notification to the Sponsor. The Sponsor reserves the 
unilateral right, at its sole discretion, to determine whether to supply investigational product and

Subjects will not be permitted to use tobacco - or nicotine -containing products within 6  months 
prior to Check -in until the EOS  visit.  
6.4. Exercise  
Subjects are required to refrain from strenuous exercise from 7 days before Check -in until EOS. 
Subjects will otherwise maintain their  normal level of physical activity during this time (ie, will 
not begin a new exercise program nor participate in any unusually strenuous physical exertion).  
6.5. Blood Donation  
Subjects are required to refrain from donation of blood from [ADDRESS_544723] to the nominal time. The order of 
priority for s cheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in descending order of priority):  
 dosing  
 PK blood samples  
 safety assessments (ECGs will be scheduled before vital signs measurements)  
 any other procedures.  
Where activities at a given timepoint coincide, consideration must be given to ensure that the 
following order of activities is maintained: ECGs, vital signs, safety laboratory assessments, and 
assessment of adverse events and serious adverse events.

7.1.1.  Pharmacokinetic Blood Sam ple Collection and Processing  
Blood samples (approximately 1 x 4 mL for sotorasib) will be collected by [CONTACT_237076]  8. Procedures for 
collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_237054] a separate 
document.  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  8) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to minimize 
risks to study subjects. This includes testing to ensure analyt ical methods produce reliable and 
valid data throughout the course of the study. This can also include, but is not limited to, 
investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer 
and comparability.  
7.1.2.  Analytical M ethodology  
Plasma concentrations of sotorasib will be determined using validated analytical procedures. 
Specifics of the analytical method will be provided in a separate document.  
7.2. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
7.2.1.  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Event s: Time Period and Frequency for 
Collecting and Reporting Safety Event Information  
Adverse event definitions, assignment of severity and causality, and procedures for reporting 
adverse events and serious adverse events are detailed in Appendix  1. 
The condition of each subject will be monitored from the time of signing the ICF to EOS. If an 
event is reported as beginning prior to sig ning of the ICF or occurs prior to initiation of study 
treatment on Day  1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] (or 
designee), the event will be recorded as subject medical history. If an event occurs after signing 
of the I CF but prior to initiation of study drug and the event is considered serious (regardless of 
causality to procedure), the event will be recorded as a serious adverse event.  
Any events occurring after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOS will be re ported as 
adverse events. Subjects will be observed for any signs or symptoms and asked about their 
condition by [CONTACT_93424], such as “How have you been feeling since you were last asked?”, 
at least once each day while resident at the study site and a t each study visit. Subjects will also be 
encouraged to spontaneously report adverse events and serious adverse events occurring at any 
other time during the study.  
Adverse Events  
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Drug Development Study: [ADDRESS_544724] (whether reported  by [CONTACT_430654]) from the first dose of study drug through the EOS visit are 
recorded/reported using the appropriate eCRF.  
Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by [CONTACT_237078] [ADDRESS_544725] dose of study treatment or the EOS visit (whichever is later) are reported using the 
appropriate eCRF  and reported on the paper -based Serious Adverse Event Report Form 
(described in Appendix  1). 
All serious adverse events will be collected, recorded, a nd reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the event. The Investigator will submit any updated 
serious adverse event data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.  
Since the criteria for the CTCAE grading scal e differs from the regulatory criteria for serious 
adverse events, if adverse events correspond to Grade 4 CTCAE toxicity grading scale criteria 
(eg, laboratory abnormality reported as Grade 4 without manifestation of life -threatening status), 
it will be l eft to the Investigator’s judgment to also report these abnormalities as serious adverse 
events. For any adverse event that applies to this situation, comprehensive documentation of the 
event’s severity must be recorded in the subject medical records.  
Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -Required Reporting Period  
After EOS, there is no requirement to actively monitor study subjects after the study has ended 
with regards to study subjects treated by [CONTACT_737]. However, if the Investigator become s 
aware of serious adverse events suspected to be related to investigational product, then these 
serious adverse events will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours following the 
Investigator’s awareness of the event.  
Serious adverse events reported out side of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the Sponsor’s safety database as clinical trial cases and handled accordingly 
based on the relationship to investigational product.  
If further safety -related data are needed to fulfill any regulatory reporting requirements for a 
reportable event, then additional information may need to be collected from the subject’s records 
after the subject ends the study.

Internal Use Only Medical and Scientific Affairs  Care will be take n not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious adverse 
events. Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to 
inquire about adverse event occurrence.  
Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adv erse Events  
After the initial adverse event/serious adverse event report, the Investigator is required to 
proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All adverse events and serious 
adverse events will be followed, where possible, until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. This will be completed at the 
Investigator’s (or designee’s) discretion.  
All new information for previously reported serious adverse events must be sent  to [COMPANY_010] 
within [ADDRESS_544726] be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
according to local re gulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators as 
necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an individual safety report describing a serious adverse event or 
other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of serious advers e events) from the 
Sponsor will file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB, if appropriate according to local 
requirements.  
Safety Monitoring Plan  
Subject safety will be routinely monitored as defined in the Sponsor’s safety surveillance and 
signal management processes.

Details of all pregnancies and/or lactation in female subjects and pregnancies in female partners 
of male subjects will be collected after the start of the study treatment until 7 days after EOS.  
If a pregnancy  is reported, the Investigator is to inform [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours of learning of the 
pregnancy and/or lactation and is to follow the procedures outlined in  Appendix  5. [COMPANY_010] 
Global Patient Safety will follow -up with the Investigator regarding additional information that 
may be requested.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy)  are considered serious adverse events.  
Further details regarding pregnancy and lactation are provided in Appendix  5. 
7.2.2.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations (including clinical 
chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology) at the times indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments in Appendix  8. Clinical laboratory evaluations are listed in  Appendix  2. 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and recording any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the Case Report Form/eCRF. The Investigator 
must determine whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values. In general, abnormal laboratory findings 
without clinical significance (based on the Investigator’s judgement) are not to be recorded as 
adverse events. However, laboratory value changes that require tre atment or adjustment in 
current therapy are considered adverse events. Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the 
laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event. Subjects who develop any 
laboratory abnormalities outside the reference ran ge that are deemed clinically meaningful 
during the study period will have follow -up laboratory assessments once a week, or more 
frequently if deemed necessary, until the abnormalities have resolved or returned to within the 
reference range or to the subje ct’s baseline values.  
Subjects will be asked to provide urine samples for drugs of abuse screen and cotinine test, and 
will undergo an alcohol urine or breath test at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
in Appendix  8. For all female subjects, a pregnancy test and FSH screen for postmenopausal 
women will be performed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix  8. 
An Investigator (or designee) will perform a clinical assessment of all clinical laboratory data.

Additional 12 -lead ECGs may be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate 
or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of ECGs is required. 
The Investigator (or designee) will perform a clinical assessment of each [ADDRESS_544728] 
evaluable PK data. The PK population for the primary endpoint analysis will include all subjects 
who received both sotorasib , and sotorasib in combination with omeprazole and an acidic

Internal  Use Only Medical and Scientific Affairs  Appendix  1: Safety Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -up, and Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Definition of Adverse Event  
Adverse Event Definition  
 An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment.  
 Note: An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a treatment, combination 
product, medical device, or proc edure.  
 Note: Treatment -emergent adverse events will be defined in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.  
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments (eg, electrocardiogram, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, that are considered 
clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, 
not related to progression of under lying disease).  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
adverse event/serious adverse event unless it is an intentional overdose taken with 
possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses are to be reported regardless 
of sequelae.  
 “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expecte d pharmacological action” per se will not 
be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event. Such instances will be 
captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical 
sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as adverse events or 
serious adverse events if they fulfill the definition of an adverse event or serious 
adverse event.  
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Drug Development Study: 8493285  AMG 510 20220024  
18 May 2022  Page 41 of 69 
Internal  Use Only Medical and Scientific Affairs  Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.  
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that 
meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:  
Results in death (fatal)  
Immediately life-threatening  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  For instance, 
drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not 
be considered life threatening even though drug -induced hepatitis can be fatal.  
Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430645], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s off ice or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54497]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147194], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred  or was necessary, the adverse event is to be considered 
serious. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did 
not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event.  
Results in persistent or significant disability/inca pacity  
The term “disability” means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of 
relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomi ting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which 
may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.

Internal  Use Only Medical and Scientific Affairs  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other medically important serious event  
Medical or scientific judgment is to be exercised in deciding whether serious 
adverse event reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical 
events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_184119] t may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These 
events are typi[INVESTIGATOR_147196].  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording  
 When an adverse event or serious adverse event occurs, it is the responsibility of 
the Investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], 
laboratory, and diagnostics reports) rel ated to the event.  
 The Investigator will then record all relevant adverse event/serious adverse event 
information in the Event electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
 The Investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
o Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptoms);  
o Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved);  
o Did the event start prior to first dose of investigational product;  
o Assessment of seriousness;  
o Severity (or toxicity defined below);  
o Assessment of rela tedness to the investigational product(s) and/or study -
mandated procedures;  
o Action taken; and  
o Outcome of event.  
 If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity  on the appropriate eCRF.   
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Drug Development Study: 8493285  AMG 510 20220024

Internal  Use Only Medical and Scientific Affairs   It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the appropriate eCRF page.  
 If specifically requested, the Investigator may need to provide additional follow -up 
information, such as discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts from the 
medical records. In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the 
subject number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_430646].  
 The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the advers e event/serious 
adverse event.  
Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Assessment of Severity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of severity for each adverse event and 
serious adverse event reported during the study. The assessment of severity will be 
based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading 
scale. For the C TCAE grading scale version 5.0, refer to: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
Assessment of Causality  
 The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational 
product(s), protocol -required therapy, and/or study -mandated procedure and each 
occurrence of each adverse event/serious  adverse event.  
 Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship between 
investigational product and the event.  
 The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
 Alternative causes, such as underlying dis ease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
 The Investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
 For each adverse event/serious adverse event, the Investigator must document in the 
medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event/serious adverse event and 
has provided an assessment of cau sality.  
 There may be situations in which a serious adverse event has occurred and the 
Investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, it is

Internal  Use Only Medical and Scientific Affairs  very important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the serious adverse event data.  
 The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send a serious adverse event follow -up report with the updated 
causality assessment.  
 The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
Follow -up of Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event  
 The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_237080]/or causality of the adverse event or serious 
adverse event as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopatho logical examinations, or consultation with other health 
care professionals.  
 If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to the Sponsor.  
 If a subject dies duri ng participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor with a copy of any postmortem 
findings including histopathology.  
 New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.  
 The Investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of receipt of the information.  
Reporting of Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting via Paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form  
 Facsimile transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form (see  Figure 2 ) is 
the preferred method to transmit this information.  
 In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
[CONTACT_9337] a copy of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form sent 
by [CONTACT_22855].  
 Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to  
complete and sign the Serious Adverse Event Report Form within the designated 
reporting time frames.  
 Once the study has ended, serious event(s) suspected to be related to investigational 
product will be reported to [COMPANY_010] if the Investigator becomes aware of a serious

All subjects must receive pregnancy prevention counseling and be advised of the risk to the fetus 
if they conceive a child during treatment and for 7 days after the end of study (EOS) visit.  
Additional medications given during the study may alter the contraceptive requirements. The  
Investigator must discuss these contraceptive changes with the subject.  
Definitions  
Women of Childbearing Potential:  premenopausal females who are anatomically and 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant following menarche.  
Women of Nonchildbearing  Potential:  
1. Surgically sterile:  Females who are permanently sterile via hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and/or bilateral oophorectomy by [CONTACT_237083]/or medical 
records. Surgical sterilization to have occurred a minimum of 6 weeks, o r at the 
Investigator’s discretion, prior to Screening.  
2. Postmenopausal:  Females at least 45 years of age with amenorrhea for 12 months 
without an alternative medical reason with confirmatory follicle -stimulating hormone 
levels of  40 mIU/mL. The amenorrh ea should not be induced by a medical condition 
such as anorexia nervosa, hypothyroid disease, or polycystic ovarian disease, or by 
[CONTACT_178697]. It should not be due to concomitant medications that may have induced 
the amenorrhea such as oral contrace ptives, hormones, gonadotropin -releasing hormones, 
anti-estrogens, or selective estrogen receptor modulators.  
Fertile male:  a male that is considered fertile after puberty.  
Infertile male:  permanently sterile male via bilateral orchiectomy.

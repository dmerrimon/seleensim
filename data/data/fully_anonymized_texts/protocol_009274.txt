14  I. SPECIFIC AIMS Approximately 30-40% of patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) meet criteria for current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).1, [ADDRESS_196569] treatment, incur higher costs, are more likely to relapse, use more treatment services, are more likely to drop out of treatment, and less likley to remain in continuing care.10, 11 Further, although outcomes in substance use vary, psychiatric symptoms, health, and psychosocial functioning are consistently worse.10, 12-15 This proposal responds directly to CSR&D’s RFA CX-09-[ADDRESS_196570] been developed for patients with co-occurring PTSD and SUD. Additionally, these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168547], nor delivered by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_168548]. Only one therapy, Seeking Safety, has been tested within a randomized controlled trial but has yet to demonstrate efficacy over a manual-guided relapse prevention treatment16 or women’s health education.[ADDRESS_196571] a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a relatively simple, manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD in patients with SUD. One hundred sixty outpatients with comborbid PTSD and SUD  will be randomly assigned to receive either: CBT for PTSD in conjunction with standard treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 80) or TAU only (n = 80) without additional individual treatment.  Our hypotheses are as follows: Primary Hypothesis 1. Patients who receive CBT will have greater improvements in PTSD symptom severity relative to patients who receive TAU only at both the conclusion of treatment and at the 6-month follow-up. Secondary Hypotheses 2. Patients who receive CBT will have greater reductions in substance use severity (drugs and/or alcohol) than patients who receive TAU only at both the conclusion of treatment and at the 6-month follow-up.  3. Patients in the CBT condition will have better retention in the addiction treatment program relative to patients who receive TAU only. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_168549]-morbid PTSD/SUD are required to have their SUD “under control” before they are referred for PTSD treatment. This puts these patients in a symptomatic “Catch-22:” If they stop using substances PTSD symptoms worsen, if they only try to address PTSD without clinical attention to their substance use disorder, their substance use worsens.  In summary, this study proposes a simple objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of CBT for PTSD in Veterans with co-occurring substance use and posttraumatic stress disorders. Our overarching goal is to increase the number of Veteran SUD patients who receive treatment for their co-morbid PTSD, and consequently improve their treatment and life outcomes. 
15  II. BACKGROUND and SIGNIFICANCE  A. Background 1. Prevalence and consequences of PTSD in addiction treatment PTSD is common among patients in addiction treatment. Approximately 30-40% 1, 10, 12, 22-24 of SUD patients meet criteria for current PTSD. The Program Evaluation and Resource Center (PERC) reported that in 2006, 34.7% of all VA SUD patients had a chart diagnosis of PTSD.25 This number likely represents a conservative estimate of the actual number with comorbid PTSD and SUD as PTSD is often undetected in addiction settings.26  PTSD is associated with greater problem severity among patients presenting to addiction treatment, including: more severe problems with drugs and alcohol;7, 11, 27 additional Axis I disorders;7, 28 more employment problems;7 more legal problems;29 more psychiatric distress, including suicidality;[ADDRESS_196572] been proposed to account for the association between PTSD and SUD.30 In one case the PTSD is primary and patients drink to cope with PTSD symptoms. In the other SUD is primary and patients’ substance use places them in risky environments where they are more likley to be traumatized. Data support the first model,20, 21 sometimes called the self-medication theory, where patients use substances to manage their PTSD symptoms. Then withdrawal symtoms may trigger and exacerbate PTSD symtoms initiating a cycle that precipi[INVESTIGATOR_168550].  In either model, it is clear that treating PTSD in patients undergoing treatment for substance use disorders is important given that greater problem severity and poorer outcomes are associated with PTSD in this population. The preponderance of evidence suggests that not addressing PTSD in addiction treatment risks negative outcomes for both substance use and PTSD. These findings stimulated development of interventions designed to improve these outcomes 3. Treatments for co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorder Several clinical practice guidelines offer recommendations for the treatment of PTSD.31, 32 The Institute of Medicine (IOM) also recently published a report evaluating the evidence on PTSD treatment.[ADDRESS_196573] effective treatment for PTSD and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. sertraline, paroxetine) as the frontline medication. Comparative studies and reviews of medications vs. psychosocial treatments favor the psychosocial treatments in terms of clinical change (effect size) and durability of effects (positive response after discontinuation of treatment).[ADDRESS_196574] been the focus of development and testing.  b. Cognitive behavioral treatments. There is unambiguous evidence for the efficacy of cognitive behavioral treatments for PTSD. VA is rolling out two cognitive behavioral treatments for PTSD as part of the Uniform Mental Health Services Handbook: Cognitive Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure. However, the vast majority of studies on cognitive behavioral treatments excluded patients with substance abuse38 and none that 
[ADDRESS_196575] emerged to extend and modify existing psychosocial PTSD treatments for patients with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders. These interventions either are exposure-based (focused on past trauma), cognitive and copi[INVESTIGATOR_168551] (focused on current adjustment), or a combination of both.  Exposure therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Exposure therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168552]. But the stress associated with direct exposure to feared memories and situations has been identified as a barrier to patients seeking or completing exposure-based approaches. Exposure treatments, although effective, may be intolerable to many patients and clinicians, and consequently may result in high attrition rates and low adoption by [CONTACT_168633].39, [ADDRESS_196576] been two specific exposure-based behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168553]-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders: Substance Dependence PTSD Treatment (SDPT)41 and Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Cocaine Dependence (CTPCD).42, 43 SDPT has been minimally researched; there is a single unpublished, uncontrolled trial on 19 patients. CTPCD was studied in an uncontrolled trial of 39 patients. Although improvement was significant for PTSD symptoms at the end of treatment, drop out was extremely high (62%) and results were marginal at [ADDRESS_196577] for resuming its study.44  Seeking Safety and other non-exposure based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. There are two, non-exposure based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168554]-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders, Transcend45 and Seeking Safety (SS).9, [ADDRESS_196578] perhaps due to the absence of other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168555] a treatment manual. It has an active program of research and its use in VA is widespread. Although no data are available on the fidelity to the SS model, PERC reports (personal communication) that in 2006, 41% of programs indicated using SS in their intensive outpatient programs (IOPs). SS is a present-focused therapy that focuses on teaching copi[INVESTIGATOR_168556]. There are 25 topi[INVESTIGATOR_168557], behavioral, interpersonal, and case management issues. Several uncontrolled pi[INVESTIGATOR_168558],e.g.,9, 47 suggesting SS may be effective in reducing substance use and in some cases PTSD symptoms in women. A small, randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 33 adolescent girls, conducted by [CONTACT_168634], also found that SS improved general trauma symptoms (but not PTSD) and substance use compared to TAU.[ADDRESS_196579] nonequivalent control group designs.  Both included women only (one in Veterans and one in non-Veterans) and found statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, reductions in PTSD symptoms and either no difference or an increase in drug use relative to the comparison groups.49, [ADDRESS_196580] study,16 96 substance dependent women from the community were randomized to either SS or a manualized relapse prevention therapy. A non-randomized community sample of women in addiction treatment (n=75) was also included. The second study,17 conducted as part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network, randomized 353 women to receive a shortened version of SS (12 sessions) or women’s health education. This study also found no discernable differences between SS and the control condition in reducing PTSD symptom severity.  In concluding a review of SS, two randomized controlled trials found clinically and statistically large reductions in PTSD symptoms but no differences versus the comparison conditions. This is unexpected given that neither relapse prevention nor health education includes treatment components shown to be effective in reducing PTSD. Outcomes related to substance use were inconsistent. While both SS and relapse prevention resulted in improved substance outcomes in the first study, there was no effect of SS or women’s health education on substance use in the second study.   
[ADDRESS_196581] out of concern that the intense emotions aroused during PTSD treatment may lead to instability and relapse.2 So, they may be hesitant to refer. In addition, although there are new PTSD/SUD clinicians assigned to every PTSD clinical team in the VA, they cannot provide the intensive substance abuse care found in addiction settings. Thus a referral to this clinician would not be appropriate for all SUD patients. An unanswered question is whether a PTSD-specific treatment can be successfully delivered in an addiction setting. We believe by [CONTACT_168635]. A brief, cognitive behavioral treatment that does not incorporate exposure components is ideally suited to the population of patients with PTSD and SUD. A treatment focused on cognitive restructuring will be more likely to be utilized by [CONTACT_168636]. And, cognitive restructuring is a simple and easy to learn therapeutic skill that has been shown to generalize beyond PTSD to other areas of patients’ lives.  B. Significance Comorbid PTSD and SUD pose a tremendous burden to VA SUD treatment resources and to the VA Health Care System. Approximately 1/[ADDRESS_196582] co-morbid PTSD.2 In 2006, 354,507 VA patients were diagnosed with substance use disorders. Of these, 121,926 (34%) received specialized substance abuse treatment,51 of which an estimated 40,000 (1/3 of the total) would be expected to have comorbid PTSD. If the PTSD remains untreated, these patients have a high probability for premature attrition and relapse. The burden of non-remitted disease not only includes continued problems with substance use and the demands on the system for continued SUD treatment, but also medical morbidity and higher medical costs associated with prolonged substance use disorders52 that would likely have been offset by [CONTACT_168637].52, 53 Addressing PTSD in SUD patients can result in significant improvements. Patients with comorbid PTSD and SUD who receive PTSD-related treatment within a year of SUD treatment are 3.7 times more likely to be in remission from SUD 5 years later.8 Therefore, the Uniform Mental Health Services Handbook requires that when PTSD or other mental health conditions co-occur with SUDs, evidence-based pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions for the other conditions need to be made available, with appropriate coordination of care, where there are no medical contraindications.  The development of a model of integrated treatment for Veterans with PTSD and SUD that could be implemented without major changes to SUD treatment delivery systems would insure that patients identified as comorbid could access effective treatment. CBT for PTSD is such an intervention. This treatment is designed for use in an addiction setting as an addition to usual care. The treatment does not involve exposure, which is believed by [CONTACT_168638]. Therefore, it is safer to administer to patients who are not yet stably in remission from SUD and it may also increase addiction therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ comfort in using the therapy. CBT for PTSD also teaches cognitive restructuring as a skill that can be applied to a range of upsetting situations, not just trauma related cognitions. As a result, it is well suited to address the multi-problem presentations of dual disorder patients. Because it does not require patients to be stably abstinent during treatment, it also provides a viable treatment option for those patients whose PTSD prevents them from abstaining.  
[ADDRESS_196583], the research team leverages the strength of several large research infrastructures including the National Center for PTSD, the Dartmouth Psychiatric Research Center, and an HSR&D Center for Excellence. Finally, [CONTACT_168674] can capi[INVESTIGATOR_168559]. In that role, she has substantial experience designing and implementing multi-site projects, developi[INVESTIGATOR_168560], forming and working collaboratively with partners.  Below we review studies on the development of our model for treating PTSD and provide data in support of adaptations to the model for special populations. These studies will demonstrate our ability to implement the model under various conditions and our skill in conducting and managing clinical trials. A. The model: Cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD  Under the direction of Drs. Mueser and Rosenberg, [CONTACT_168674], along with other Dartmouth investigators, developed a CBT model for PTSD for persons with severe mental illness (SMI).[ADDRESS_196584] a premium on the importance of individuals' appraisals of traumatic events, their own reactions and those of others, and the meaning of the experience in terms of oneself and one’s place in the world. In addition, the model employs cognitive restructuring to teach individuals how to examine and challenge their trauma-related appraisals and does not include exposure therapy. This approach is based on research showing that cognitive restructuring is just as effective as exposure therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168561]39, 40, 56 and more effective than any alternatives.39, 57-59 Many clinicians believe exposure is contraindicated for PTSD patients with SUD60 and may therefore be more likely to utilize a model based on cognitive restructuring. Consequently, a growing research base indicates that the model has high acceptability to both vulnerable individuals from special populations and clinicians, poses low stress, and is clinically effective.18, 61, 62 1. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_168562]63 was conducted with 12 SMI patients. Hamblen (PI) treated several of these patients, including one with substance dependence (in addition to PTSD and bipolar disorder).[ADDRESS_196585]. He was later raped while serving in the Navy. Following the rape he began drinking heavily and using intravenous drugs; he was eventually administratively discharged. The patient’s longest period of sobriety was 2½ years following an inpatient substance abuse treatment program. He had two other inpatient psychiatric admissions as well. The patient responded will to the CBT for PTSD treatment.  He was actively engaged and attended all sessions. At post-treatment and 3-month follow-up he no longer met criteria for PTSD. His score on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) dropped from [ADDRESS_196586] treatment and 9 at 3-month follow-up. Although he did not attempt to quit drinking during the treatment his continued use did not prevent him from making significant treatment gains. 2. Randomized controlled trial We recently completed a randomized controlled trial comparing our treatment model with TAU in 108 SMI 
19  patients who also had PTSD. The participants, much like those from addiction settings, were complex, multi-problem patients with significant comorbidities. Primary diagnoses included schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (16%), major depression (61%), or bipolar disorder (23%). Secondary diagnoses included current substance abuse (41%) and borderline personality disorder (25%). Ninety percent of patients had at least one prior psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; the median was 4 admissions. In the patients who received CBT for PTSD there were high retention rates (81%) and significantly greater improvements than in the TAU patients in PTSD symptoms, depression, perceived health, and trauma-related thoughts at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.[ADDRESS_196587], because it initially was designed as a treatment for people with SMI (i.e., schizophrenia, mood disorders, and borderline personality disorder), considerable effort was applied to determining how to make an intellectually challenging concept, such as cognitive restructuring, as basic and understandable as possible. For example, the model focuses on only four major feeling states, includes supplemental training on identifying thoughts related to these feelings, and utilizes a basic cognitive restructuring worksheet. This simplified version of PTSD treatment is well suited for populations with considerable problems and comorbidity such as patients with PTSD and SUDs. Second, the goal of the cognitive restructuring is not necessarily to modify cognitions but rather to teach a skill for evaluating one’s thinking when negative emotions are experienced. If a thought is determined to be inaccurate, the individual is taught to replace it with a more accurate one. When thoughts are determined to be accurate, or beliefs are resistant to change, the model allows for brain storming and problem solving to address the situation. This is different from more traditional cognitive therapy models where patients are confronted with the assertion that their thinking is inaccurate and forced to change their thoughts. We believe this approach will be more acceptable to SUD patients who may initially be more resistant to changing their thoughts, especially those around how their substance use may be worsening their PTSD symptoms and putting themselves at risk. Third, the cognitive restructuring is intended to be applied in any situation in which the person identifies negative affect; thus it can easily be extended to a range of situations that go beyond PTSD. The treatment is especially well suited to patients with comorbid conditions as the cognitive restructuring can be applied to those situations as well. For example, patients with PTSD and SUD may be concerned that they may relapse. The cognitive restructuring can easily be applied to this situation where patients can either develop a more accurate thought or problem solve around strategies to prevent relapse. B. Adaptations to the model Investigators from our research team took the lead on developi[INVESTIGATOR_168563], PTSD for disaster survivors and PTSD for people with co-occurring substance use disorders. Both retain the core cognitive restructuring component.  1. CBT for Postdisaster Distress  Under the direction of [CONTACT_168674], CBT for Postdisaster Distress (CBT-PD)[ADDRESS_196588] attack in [LOCATION_001]. Several modifications of the manual were necessary to adapt the model to the disaster context. For example, we needed to significantly expand the psychoeducation module to include information about common disaster related reactions in addition to PTSD. We also added a behavioral activation component (i.e., pleasant activities scheduling) to target the high rates of depression. The model was also shortened from [ADDRESS_196589] Liberty.66 Crisis counseling participants who scored above a specified cut-point on a screening tool were offered a referral to either CBT-PD or a grief intervention program. Participants improved significantly in 3 of 5 functioning domains and had significantly fewer symptoms of depression and grief and marginally less traumatic stress compared to baseline levels.  
20  We recently completed an evaluation of CBT-PD among survivors of Hurricane Katrina.61 Trained community-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168564]-PD to adult survivors as part of InCourage, a mental health program sponsored by [CONTACT_168639]. Participants (n = 88) who were assessed at referral, pretreatment, intermediate treatment, and posttreatment showed significant and large improvements. The overall pre-post effect size was 1.[ADDRESS_196590] been assessed.61  We are currently conducting a randomized controlled trial of CBT-PD in survivors of Hurricane Ike from the Galveston Bay Area. One hundred fifty participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: CBT-PD (n = 75) or Education for postdisaster distress (n = 75). Consistent with the goals of CBT-PD, the range of assessed outcomes is broad, including psychiatric diagnoses, PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, functioning, and quality of life. An important question was whether we could successfully recruit and train community clinicians to deliver the intervention with fidelity. We examined this question in a paper currently under review.67 One hundred four therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168565] a two-day training in CBT-PD with on-going case consultation. Following training, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168566], their knowledge and understanding of those elements, and their confidence that they could use them effectively. Immediately following the training, 90% of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168567]-PD. Self-report measures from both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168568]. This work suggests that the CBT model can be used with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168569]-level training. This is particularly relevant given the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168570]. In summary, there is growing support for CBT-PD. The treatment, an adaptation from the CBT for PTSD model, has been shown to be effective for disaster survivors with PTSD, depression, and other disaster related distress. We have had success in recruiting and training non-academic, clinicians in delivering the intervention and in retaining survivors in the treatment. 2. CBT for PTSD in patients with SUD Under the direction of Dr. McGovern (co-investigator), the CBT for PTSD model was adapted for use in an addiction setting. The primary modifications involve formally integrating discussion and work that address the relationship between PTSD and addiction. The introduction of the treatment makes clear the nature of the relationship between the addiction treatment program and CBT for PTSD. For example, patients are required to be in “good status” in the addiction program for the CBT to continue.  Patients are informed about the type of information that might be shared (substance use) or not shared (details of trauma) with the addiction program by [CONTACT_168640][INVESTIGATOR_541]. The crisis plan focuses on relapse to substances, and not relapses of psychiatric symptoms. Psycho-education more thoroughly establishes the relationship between PTSD and substance use, such as use of substances to cope with re-experiencing and hyper-arousal symptoms, and as the primary manifestation of avoidance symptoms. Finally, since addiction can be conceptualized as a chronic condition, most people are encouraged to attend peer recovery support group meetings in the community for the foreseeable future. The last module on generalization training and termination addresses the weaving of skills learned in the CBT for PTSD model into these treatments. a. Feasibility study. Initial feasibility was evaluated with [ADDRESS_196591]-treatment, and for 2 patients these reductions increased at 3-month follow-up (Fig.1). On average, there was a 40% reduction in PTSD symptoms (CAPS Baseline Mean=63, CAPS 3-month follow up mean=38). Using the PTSD diagnostic criteria cut-off score on the CAPS of 45, none of the cases met criteria for a PTSD diagnosis at post-treatment or follow-up. Two patients were abstinent at post-treatment (note that patient 1001’s data is behind patient 1015’s data), and 1 had reduced days of use by 50%. At follow-up, one patient had continued to use alcohol, one had maintained consistent abstinence and one had used cocaine for one day (Fig. 2). All patients completed both CBT for PTSD and the addiction treatment program.   
[ADDRESS_196592] 30100110141015    Figure 1: CAPS Total Score Figure 2: Substance Use 
b. Uncontrolled trial. In the next phase, clinicians from 3 community programs were recruited to deliver the therapy: 1 psychiatric nurse practitioner, 1 masters’ level and 1 bachelors’ level counselor, [ADDRESS_196593], and 1 addiction counselor intern. Only 1 had experience with CBT, PTSD, or manual-guided treatments. In addition to the didactic training, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168571]. Twice-monthly supervision was face-to-face, and twice monthly supervision was via telephone.  Eleven patients were enrolled in the treatment.18 Their average age was 34.4 years, all were Caucasian, and 91% were women. All patients met criteria for current PTSD (past 30 day symptoms) and had an average CAPS score of 73.9 (SD=13.9), indicating significant severity. With respect to baseline substance use, most patients were negative on current toxicological screens (urine and breath), but reported use on an average of [ADDRESS_196594] 90 days. Drug and alcohol severity composite scores on the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) were within a moderate to severe range of problem level. Figure 3: CAPS Diagnosis Over Time    CAPS scores were significantly reduced from baseline to post-treatment (p<.001), and follow-up (p<.001). As seen in Figure 3, the number of cases who met criteria for PTSD dropped from 100% at baseline to 27% at post-treatment. At follow-up, 80% of cases no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD.18 There were no changes in positive toxicological data or in days of drug or alcohol use. However, there were significant decreases in the ASI severity composite scores between baseline and the follow-up periods (alcohol, p <.05; drug, p<.05).[ADDRESS_196595] to retention, 65% of patients completed at least 8 sessions. c. Randomized controlled trial. We are now pi[INVESTIGATOR_168572] a randomized controlled trial comparing CBT for PTSD with Individual Addiction Counseling (IAC); all patients receive addiction TAU. IAC was adapted from the Individual Drug Counseling manual used in the NIDA Cocaine Collaborative Study. IAC is an intervention that does not directly address PTSD symptoms, but instead its mechanism of action is focused on addiction and recovery. We selected IAC because it has an evidence-base for effectiveness with drug use disorders, is matched in attention and frequency to CBT, and its mechanisms of therapeutic action should not directly affect PTSD but instead reduce substance use.  Two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168573] 4 sites volunteered. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168574]. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168575] 6 masters’ level counselors (2 of whom were licensed alcohol and drug counselors) and 2 bachelors’ level counselors (1 a licensed alcohol and drug counselor). Thus, these clinicians might be considered representative of the community addiction treatment program clinical workforce.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168576]. Thus, each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168577].  [ADDRESS_196596]-Treatm ent3-MoFollow-up% Positive for PTSD
[ADDRESS_196597]-Treatment% Positive for PTSDCBTIACTo date, we have gathered baseline and post-treatment data on 8 cases in CBT, and 4 cases in IAC (30% of planned enrollment). The following preliminary findings are available at the time of this application. The 
average age of participants in the CBT group was 40 years, 87.5% are women, and all are Caucasian. Among the IAC group, the average age was 35 years, 50.0% are women, and all are Caucasian. At baseline, all of the participants had PTSD, with an average CAPS score of 67.3 (SD=16.5) in the CBT group and 77.0 (SD=23.5) in the IAC group. The majority of patients had negative breathalyzer and urine toxicological screens (100% and 87.5%, respectively in CBT; 75.0% and 75.0% respectively in IAC). The CBT group reported significantly more drinking than the IAC group (29 out of 90 days vs. 1 out of 90 days), whereas the IAC group reported significantly more drug use (48 out of 90 days vs. 9 out of 90 days). Alcohol and drug severity scores (on the ASI) were in the moderate to severe range at baseline. CAPS total scores decreased over time in both groups (Figure 4). Although there was not a significant group X time interaction, there was a significant reduction in PTSD severity only in the CBT group (p=.05) and not in the IAC group. After treatment, only 12.5% of the CBT participants met criteria for PTSD, in comparison with 50% of IAC participants, but the difference was not statistically significantly, most likely given the small sample size (Figure 5). Figure 4: CAPS Total Score in CBT (n=8) and IAC (n=4) Figure 5: CAPS Diagnosis in CBT (n=8) and IAC (n=4)  In terms of substance use, CBT had the largest impact on alcohol use and IAC had the largest impact on drug use.  This may have been due to the fact that most participants in CBT drank and most in IAC used drugs. For the CBT group, there was a significant reduction in the number of days of alcohol use (p=.01) and a reduction in alcohol severity on the ASI alcohol composite (p=.05). Participants in the IAC group significantly reduced the number of days of drug use (p=.05), but not alcohol use, and had no significant changes on the ASI alcohol or drug composite scores.  In terms of retention, 69.2% of the patients in the CBT group completed at least 8 sessions and 80.0% of the IAC patients completed at least [ADDRESS_196598] equivalent retention. CBT retention (69.2%) is consistent with the findings in the feasibility study (65%) and indicates good patient acceptability. Data on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168578].  All therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168579].  4. Summary Given the scientific literature on the prevalence and consequences of PTSD in standard addiction treatment and a synthesis of the evidence for the available research-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it is clear that there is a need for a PTSD treatment that can be integrated into existing addiction services. Currently, there are no PTSD specific 
[ADDRESS_196599] the trial. We bring together key members of the initial PTSD treatment model development team (Mueser & Hamblen) with the investigator who took the lead on its adaptation for use in an addiction setting (McGovern). Additionally, we have brought in leaders in VA on both the impact of PTSD on SUD treatment outcomes (Ouimette) and the effectiveness of SS in a VA addiction setting (Kimerling).  IV. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A. Design 1. Overview The proposed research will evaluate the effectiveness of the addition of a relatively simple, manual-guided CBT for PTSD to TAU in patients with co-occurring PTSD and SUD. One-hundred-sixty outpatients with comborbid PTSD/SUD will be randomly assigned to receive either CBT for PTSD in conjunction with standard TAU (n = 80) or TAU (n = 80) without additional individual treatment. Recruitment will target participants at three VA intensive outpatient addiction programs as well as participants with SUD and PTSD in those facilities who are not in the IOP. Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment (approximately 4 months from baseline) and 6 month follow-up (approximately 10 months from baseline). Consistent with the goals of CBT for PTSD, the range of assessed outcomes includes both PTSD and substance use. Clinician adherence to the manual will be evaluated. Primary analyses will focus on the hypothesis that CBT for PTSD is more effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD than TAU.  2. Design considerations We proposed an additive design because we think it optimizes the internal and ecological validity of the study. We are interested in determining whether care as usual can be improved by [CONTACT_168641]. Specifically, we want to test whether it is desirable to add a new therapeutic regimen to TAU for substance abusing patients with the additional problem of PTSD. Thus, all participants must receive usual care for substance abuse treatment in addition to the new treatment. One concern that is sometimes raised with additive designs is that they do not control for the amount of treatment. To control for this, an alternative treatment can be offered to equate time. However, we do not think amount of treatment would be a plausible explanation for the expected difference between the CBT and TAU arms because the amount of CBT we propose to add is small relative to the amount of time in TAU treatment. Depending on the site, Veterans will receive between 87 and 225 hours of care in their intensive outpatient program, not including any mental health treatment Veterans may receive outside of the program. On average, CBT would only add 4-11% more treatment, depending on the program. We will carefully measure treatment services of the participants with SUD and PTSD who are not enrolled in one of the two intensive outpatient programs. Another reason to consider comparing an active treatment to an alternative one is if the question focuses on whether the new treatment improves outcomes obtained by [CONTACT_168642]. Currently there is no standard of care to use as a comparison. Although Seeking Safety appears to be the most widely used treatment in VA for patients with comorbid PTSD and SUD, the empi[INVESTIGATOR_168580]’s health education. Therefore, treatment as usual can serve as the control for whether observed outcome is due to any addiction treatment versus the addition of CBT specifically. B. Sample and Recruitment 1. Inclusion criteria Eligible subjects will meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) At least 18 years old, (2) Diagnosis of current substance use disorder, (3) Diagnosis of PTSD confirmed by [CONTACT_168643] a 
24  total symptom score of 45 or more, (4) English speaking, (5) Agree to be audio recorded, and (6) Willing and able to provide informed consent.  2. Exclusion criteria Only three exclusion criteria will be applied in order to maximize sample representativeness. (1) Individuals with acute psychotic symptoms will be excluded if they are not well-connected with appropriate mental health services. (2) Patients with a psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54692] a suicide attempt or severe suicide risk or who made an attempt in the last month regardless of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168581]. (3) Individuals with unstable medical or legal situations that would make completion of the study highly unlikely will be excluded. Thus, as previously noted, the proposed research will attempt to recruit as heterogeneous and representative a patient sample as possible. 3. Expected participant demographics and diagnostic characteristics Based on information provided by [CONTACT_168644],51 about 95% of the patients are male, 24% are married, and the average age is 50 years old. About 52% are Caucasian, 41% African American, 7% Hispanic and 1% some other racial/ethnic group. Overall, 50% are Vietnam War era and 36% have a service-connected disability. With respect to diagnostic characteristics, 24% of SUD outpatients have a diagnosis of alcohol abuse/dependence only, 17% have a diagnosis of drug abuse/dependence only, and 45% have both disorders. Of the SUD outpatients seen in specialized care without alcohol or drug diagnoses, 4.5% had nicotine dependence as their only SUD diagnosis. About 60% had one or more other psychiatric disorders. 4. Sites A search conducted by [CONTACT_168645] 112 IOPs (i.e., SUD programs that offer at least 3 hours a day of treatment, 3 days per week). Of these 46 (41%) were excluded because they reported offering SS. We felt it was important to exclude sites that offered SS because it is not clinically indicated to have patients receive two trauma treatments simultaneously. From this search we selected, Tampa, FL and Syracuse, NY. These sites were selected because they treat more than 1,[ADDRESS_196600] 3 SUD visits within 30 days. Next we conservatively estimate that 30% of SUD patients will meet criteria for PTSD (see background). Finally, we included only those we believed will be interested. Randomized trials of brief interventions for SUD patients found that approximately 60% of patients eligible for study participation agreed to participate.68-[ADDRESS_196601] 60% of eligible participants will be interested. However, our study will have adequate power even if only 33% of patients agree to participate (See Table 1, Section B6 below, and the Inclusion and Enrollment Table included under Human Subjects). Table 1.

25  Below is a revised recruitment table, assuming we are approved to recruit within the next two months through the end of the proposed study.  These numbers show potentially eligible participants assuming we open recruitment up beyond the IOP in the two facilities.  Numbers of veterans with comorbid PTSD and SUD were provided by [CONTACT_168646] 2012. (Note: numbers would be higher if we receive a one year no-cost extension) Site Estimated # of PTSD cases with SUD (25%) If 60% patients interested If 33% patients interested Tampa, FL [ADDRESS_196602] a sample that would yield .80 power in longitudinal analysis with generalized estimating equations model (a type of generalized linear mixed models) to find a standardized detectable difference from .4 to .5 between intervention and usual care, assuming alpha = .05, two-tailed. We assume that the correlation between repeated measures will be .60. The outcome of treatments will be measured at two points in time (3-month and 9-month) for each individual. The sample size for our primary hypothesis (difference in slopes by [CONTACT_168647]) is based on Diggle, Liang, and Zeger,71 who developed a formula to calculate sample size for longitudinal studies with repeated measures to estimate the difference between slopes (or rate of change in CAPS as in this case) of two groups (m = size per arm):  where  , the within-subject variance of the xj; type I error α= 0.05, power β = 0.[ADDRESS_196603] meaningful difference d = β1B – β1A and σ2 = Var(εij) measures the unexplained variability in the response, Corr(Yij,Yik) =  ρ for all j ≠ k, and n is the number of repeated measures per person.  Using this formula and based on these assumptions, we estimated the sample size needed. Table 2 shows how required total enrollment (both groups) would vary for a range of expected effects and if the true effect is larger or smaller than expected for a range of possible missing data scenarios. Table 2. Enrollment Number N (total of two groups) as a function of effect size and rates of missing endpoints due to drop out and loss to follow-up  Loss to Measurement actual effect size 10% 15% 20% .40 160 169 180 .45 126 134 142 .50 102 108 115  We propose to enroll 160 subjects (80 in each treatment arm). The table shows we will have adequate power to find an effect as small as d = 0.4 if the percentage of missing data is 10%. And if the actual missing data is 20%, we still have enough subjects to detect an effect as small as .45. Because the primary analysis is intention-to-treat, we are basing our drop out on participants who are completely lost to measurement and not  on those who do not complete treatment. We believe 20% is a conservative rate.

26  C. Study Treatments Participants will be randomized to TAU plus CBT or TAU alone. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168583]. Ratings of CBT recordings (adherence and competence indexes) will confirm therapy integrity and independence.  1. CBT for PTSD CBT for PTSD in addiction treatment programs is a simple, manual-guided individual therapy.54 It consists of 3 learning and skill components designed to improve PTSD symptoms and substance use: (1) Patient education about PTSD and its relation to substance use and treatment; (2) Breathing retraining: A behavioral anxiety reduction skill; and (3) Cognitive restructuring: A cognitive approach and functional analysis of the link among emotions, cognitions and situations.  CBT for PTSD has [ADDRESS_196604] session begins with an orientation to the treatment and is followed by [CONTACT_66867] a crisis and relapse prevention plan. Breathing retraining is introduced as a skill for managing and decreasing anxiety. It involves teaching patients how to slow their breathing in order to reduce hyperventilation by [CONTACT_168648] a soothing self-statement such as “calm” or “relax.” Patients are reminded of the “fight or flight” response and how under threat people respond by [CONTACT_168649]. Breathing retraining counteracts the automatic response and thereby [CONTACT_168650]. After the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168584], the patient practices it first in session and then for homework under calm situations. Later, when patients become more proficient at the skill, they are encouraged to use the breathing skill to calm themselves when anxious. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_168585]-education is introduced in sessions [ADDRESS_196605] to normalize patients’ reactions and reduce stigma concerns. If done properly, it can also provide a rationale for why patients are experiencing their distress, instill hope, and improve engagement.  
            
[ADDRESS_196606] patients are introduced to the concept that people’s emotional reactions to events are determined by [CONTACT_168651]. These interpretations may be influenced by [CONTACT_168652], including traumatic events. Patients are informed that different types of negative feelings are associated with specific types of thoughts, which are often automatic and occur outside of their awareness. Patients identify upsetting situations and the associated thoughts and feelings.  Next patients are introduced to the cognitive distortions (called common styles of thinking) that may result from basing current thinking on past traumatic experiences. For example, patients who have experienced traumatic events often “catastrophize” or “overestimate risk” in situations in which there is no reason to suspect that something bad will happen. Patients are apprised of common problematic thinking styles and are helped to identify and correct distortions related to negative emotions. Thereafter, patients are introduced to a five-step cognitive restructuring (CR) method for dealing with negative emotions. These steps are summarized on a worksheet, which is used both in the session with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168586]. The five steps of CR are (1) Describe the situation, (2) Identify the negative feeling, (3) Identify the thought related to the feeling, (4) Challenge the thought, and (5) Take action. Patients practice CR for the remainder of the treatment sessions. The goal is to help patients move from learning CR as a skill to applying it to their disaster-related thoughts and from using the formal CR worksheet to completing the steps in their head when they are in an upsetting situation or immediately after it is over.  The last session focuses on generalization training and termination to ensure that the patient is able to use cognitive restructuring on their own outside of sessions, to review treatment gains, and discuss any plans to meet ongoing or potential needs that may arise.

28  2. TAU Addiction treatment programs vary widely in VA. Data from PERC51 provide a sense of typi[INVESTIGATOR_168588]. 95% of all SUD IOP programs report providing group and/or individual psychotherapy to their patients. Just over half of the programs (57%) report that their patients participate in on-site SUD-related self help groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Only 11% of programs offered contingency contracting. The majority of programs conduct a psychiatric assessment of SUD patients (78%) and about half receive psychiatric treatment (54%) or medication (41%) for a co-morbid psychiatric disorder.  The Tampa Alcohol and Drug Abuse Treatment Program (ADATP) is a 3 week IOP that consists of a 7 day, 4 hours per day, program.  Relapse prevention, aftercare groups, and family sessions are offered additionally in the afternoon and evenings. The philosophy of the ADATP is based on an understanding of alcohol and drug abuse/dependence as a complex biopsychosocial illness. The major thrust of the treatment approach is derived from the 12-step model of recovery with additional emphasis on educational and cognitive-behavioral approaches. Each patient’s individual recovery program has its own structured aftercare component, which is an integral part of treatment. Patients are strongly encouraged to participate in voluntary substance recovery organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Al-Anon, Narcotics Anonymous (NA), Cocaine Anonymous, and Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACOA). The ADATP program includes a six week dual diagnoses treatment program for patients who have co-occurring substance abuse and mental health disorders.  The focus is on evaluation, stabilization, and intensive treatment. This phase includes individual and group therapy, educational classes, therapeutic outings, and medication management.   The Syracuse Substance Abuse Treatment Service offers a six week IOP that consists of a [ADDRESS_196607] hour of the program is focused on meditation and one time per week, patients receive acupuncture. The second hour is education; topi[INVESTIGATOR_168589]-behavioral strategies (e.g., relapse warning signs) and other relevant topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (e.g., dealing with medical problems). The final 2 hours are group psychotherapy that are tailored to the needs of the group based on a CBT approach. Each patient is also required to attend an hour of individual counseling every other week. Twelve step participation is recommended depending on patients’ needs but not required. The program also offers a dual-diagnosis group for patient who are mentally ill and chemically addicted and an aftercare program that teaches relapse prevention. The White River Junction Residential Recover Center (RRC) program is offered as a six week intensive residential program specifically providing tandem evidence based treatments for co-morbidities such as PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, and accommodation for either cognitive effects of PTSD or of traumatic brain injury. To determine actual level of involvement in the IOPs, we will extract from the electronic medical record (i.e., Vista) days and types of SUD treatment received as well as additional services including mental health and primary care visits. We will also extract utilization records for participants who are not in IOP programs.  In addition, all participants will provide information on a treatment services interview.  D. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168590], training, supervision and quality monitoring Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168591]. We will not screen out therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168592]-existing criteria, experiences, or credentials. Several studies now demonstrate the feasibility of training community clinicians in manualized, cognitive behavioral treatments for trauma. Rape crisis counselors, community mental health clinicians, and school-based counselors have been shown to be able to learn specific cognitive behavioral interventions and to provide them with good outcome.67, 73-[ADDRESS_196608] we can respond to any attrition of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168593].  All therapi[INVESTIGATOR_137084] a two-day training in CBT for PTSD offered by [CONTACT_168655] (PI) and McGovern (Co-I). This training, initially developed for the disaster treatment context, has been modified to include a specific module summarizing the research with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders and includes PTSD/SUD case examples. The training in CBT for PTSD includes a combination of modalities such as lecture, practice exercises, expert demonstration (including live and video demonstrations), and role plays. The 
29  training begins by [CONTACT_116826][INVESTIGATOR_168594] a solid rationale for the intervention. In presenting the rationale, trainers review empi[INVESTIGATOR_168595]/SUD treatments, such as Seeking Safety, and share the philosophy behind the development of this model. The goal is to establish the credibility of the treatment with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Next, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168596]-by-step through each session of the intervention. Session goals are emphasized and suggestions for meeting those goals are provided. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168597], how to integrate handouts into the teaching of the intervention, and how to address specific problems that may arise.  After a new technique has been described, the trainers demonstrate the technique and clinicians have an opportunity to participate in a role play to promote skill acquisition. For example, following a lecture on cognitive restructuring clinicians engage in a group practice exercise where they brainstorm typi[INVESTIGATOR_168598]. Next the trainers demonstrate cognitive restructuring using a clinician volunteer and a real example. Finally, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168599].  Barriers to implementation are openly discussed and debated throughout the training. Specific barriers addressed include the effects of manuals on the therapeutic relationship, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ concerns about manuals not being able to meet patients’ individual needs, credibility of the manual, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168600]. From the beginning, trainers emphasize the importance of the therapeutic relationship when using manualized treatments and encourage therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168601] a therapeutic alliance. A second area of emphasis is on demonstrating the flexibility of the manual and showing how the manual can be tailored to meet individual patient needs.  Follow-up consultation is crucial to ensuring fidelity to the intervention. In this study each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168602], and be carefully supervised using audio recording of each session, and an hour of supervision for each hour of therapy. The first case will not be included in the research, and subsequent cases will not be included until the PI [INVESTIGATOR_168603]. A similar approach was used by [CONTACT_168656]76 in the study of SS. Once confirmed by [CONTACT_168657], therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168604]. Supervision will be provided by [CONTACT_168655] (PI) and Bernardy (Co-I). McGovern will provide additional supervision as needed. Supervision includes a review of the status of all active cases followed by [CONTACT_28920]-depth presentation of 1-[ADDRESS_196609] will be expected to prepare a case in advance and be able to provide a cognitive restructuring example for review. It is at the discretion of the supervisors to identify who will present.  In advance, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168605] (Adherence and Competence [ACI] Index) so they know how their audio recordings will be evaluated. In addition, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168606] a session-by-session “Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168607]”.  All sessions will be audio recorded. Digital recordings will be uploaded to the secure server at Research Services at the White River Junction VA.  [CONTACT_168675], one of the original developers of CBT for PTSD, will rate a random sample of 15% of all recorded sessions for each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168608]. From our earlier studies, we expect the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168609].  E. Assessments and Data Management The site coordinator will complete the screening assessment and the assessor will complete the eligibility, baseline, and follow-up assessments. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_168610] 3.[ADDRESS_196610]. The same assessors will be used for both methods. All assessment instruments are described in detail below and summarized in Table 4. 1. Screening The PC-PTSD77 is a brief 4-item screen for PTSD. The PC-PTSD was developed with VA primary care patients, where the instrument detected PTSD diagnoses more accurately than did clinician diagnosis. In an 
30  SUD population the PC-PTSD has a sensitivity of .90, and a specificity of .77. This screen has been adopted for use in all returning Iraq/Afghanistan Veterans and as a performance measure for primary care. The screen will be used to identify patients in need of full PTSD assessment to determine eligibility for the treatment trial prior to randomization.  2. Eligibility Sociodemographics. Brief assessment of patient’s social and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, and level of education. Measure includes questions on periods of service and disability status. Life Events Checklist: The Life Events Checklist is used with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale as a measure of trauma exposure. To be eligible for the study, patients need to endorse at least one Criterion A traumatic event. The Checklist will also provide descriptive information about the patients in the study. Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS): The CAPS78 is a structured diagnostic interview and is widely regarded as the gold standard for determining a diagnosis of PTSD. It has excellent reliability and validity78, [ADDRESS_196611] 2.79 Ratings will be based on current symptoms (past month).  Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-Patient Edition with Psychotic Screen (SCID-P): Substance use disorders and other Axis I psychiatric diagnoses (other than PTSD) will be established using the SCID.80-[ADDRESS_196612] for establishing adult psychiatric diagnosis.82 Our research center has extensive experience training research interviewers and using the SCID with a wide range of clinical populations, including patients with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders. 3. Outcomes Participants’ treatment outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment for the CBT group (approximately 3 months after baseline) and 3 months after baseline for the TAU group, and at 6 month follow up (approximately 9 months after baseline).  CAPS: PTSD severity, as measured by [CONTACT_25905] (see above) will serve as the primary outcome measure. CAPS severity is calculated by [CONTACT_168658]. We will also examine the percentage of patients who show clinically significant change on the CAPS, as defined as a decrease of [ADDRESS_196613] (PCL): A secondary measure of PTSD will be the PCL.83 The PCL is a widely used self-report measure that assesses the 17 DSM-IV PTSD symptoms. Responses to these questions are on a scale of 1 to 5 (“not at all” to “extremely”). The PCL has excellent psychometric properties. It will be administered at all assessments, and at every other treatment session to monitor symptoms.83  Addiction Severity Index (ASI): The ASI84 is a multi-dimensional semi-structured interview that assesses lifetime and current use of all major classes of drugs of abuse plus history of substance related problems and history of SUD treatment. Five domains commonly associated with substance use are also assessed: medical, legal, employment, social/family, and psychological functioning. The ASI has good reliability and validity and has been used extensively with Veterans84 We will utilize a brief, reliable and valid version of the ASI that derives current composite scores on alcohol and drug use which will serve as our primary outcome for measuring substance abuse.85 Time-line Follow-back interview (TLFB): The timeline follow-back interview method gathers self-report information about drug and alcohol use over the past [ADDRESS_196614] used. The TLFB has excellent psychometric properties87, 88 and will enable us to measure variables used in the COMBINE trial such as “percent days abstinent,” “heavy drinking,” and “good clinical outcome.”89 Heavy drinking was defined as 5 (men) or 4 (women) drinks per day. Good clinical outcome was measured as moderate drinking without problems. Moderate drinking was defined as a maximum of 14 (men) or 11 (women) drinks per week, with no more than 2 days on which more than 4 drinks (men) or 3 drinks (women) were consumed. (Problems will be measured with the ASI).89 
31  Toxicological data: Both urine screen and breathalyzer data will be collected to detect substance use. AlcoHawk ABI breathalyzer, a semiconductor oxide sensor, is Department of Transportation/ National Highway Traffic Safety Administration approved and FDA cleared for consumer use. Cannabis, cocaine, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], amphetamine, methamphetamine, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_168611]-Drug Screen Test Card with Integrated iCup, a rapid urine screening test that uses lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of multiple drugs and drug metabolites in urine. It includes built-in validity/adulteration tests for temperature, and specific urine characteristics such as pH, gravity, nitrite, creatinine, and glutaraldehyde, as well as the presence of oxidants (e.g., bleach or hydrogen peroxide).  Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9):90 The PHQ-9 is adapted from the PRIME-MD. It can be used as a screen for depression or as a severity measure. We will be using it as a measure of severity. SF-12V:91 The SF-12V is a measure of functioning health and well being from the patient’s point of view. This version is for use in Veterans. Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (adapted)92: The Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) is a self-report measure ( 5 items) that includes questions about the frequency, intensity, and duration of craving, resistance of drinking and drug use, and provides overall ratings. Treatment Utilization and Retention:  Data pertinent to service utilization and retention such as type and number of visits patients made to usual care SUD treatment services, as well as for other medical and psychiatric services, will be extracted from medical records using CAPRI or JLV and and placed into the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) study folder. VA TBI screening status will also be extracted in a similar manner.

Assessor training and inter-rater reliability Independent assessors will be trained to criteria on the CAPS and SCID. CAPS training consists of 80% agreement on all items, plus diagnostic agreement, on [ADDRESS_196617] diagnostic agreement on two consecutive cases. All sessions are audio-recorded and reviewed as necessary by [CONTACT_978]. Inter-rater reliability will be conducted on 10% of CAPS and 10% SCID at each assessment point and for each site. 5. Follow-up methods Our research team has excellent experience and methods to successfully follow patients in community treatments. These methods include: documenting address and relevant phone number information, obtaining contact [CONTACT_168659] (minimum of 2) who would be able to contact [CONTACT_102], and at the baseline session establishing a working alliance between assessor and patient. To achieve high follow-up rates, we also follow the procedures recommended by [INVESTIGATOR_73808]93 and Twitchell et al,94 such as patient education and motivation, collection of extensive and verified locator information, between assessments contacts via the mail and telephone, confirmation of follow-up appointments prior to follow-up date, standardized tracking procedures, and research team and site coordinator case review meetings. The same assessor who conducts the baseline assessment will (whenever possible) also conduct the post-treatment and [ADDRESS_196618] found that conceptualizing the assessment process as a 3-part process (i.e., 3 assessment points) is helpful. For participants with travel difficulties, or for those who have left the area, telephone assessments will be used. 6. Data management and security Data will be entered by [CONTACT_779]-coordinator at each site. All forms will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness prior to data entry. Data will be entered electronically into an Access database specifically designed for the study and located on a VA protected server. Each item will be subject to range testing and validity checks as provided by [CONTACT_168660]. We will use a double-entry method whereby [CONTACT_168661], which are then corrected prior to data analyses. To maximize data accuracy, the project manager will carefully review all data prior to analyses, conducting several manual calculations, random spot-checking, and programmed range/validity checks on summary scores. Data from the site databases will be transmitted either by [CONTACT_168662], VT through a secure internet connection, or by a secure FTP of data files which are then loaded into the central database at White River Junction. We will work with our local ISO to determine what method is most secure.  Study site coordinators will extract data from the medical record. This will be transmitted to the White River Junction VA by [CONTACT_168663]’s Research Services. A participant will be identified in the central database by [CONTACT_168664]. Identifying information, such as name, address will not be stored electronically. It will be kept at the site in locked cabinets in locked offices at all times. All computer systems and programs will be password protected. Good computer security practice (shutting down of computers after work hours, restricting physical access to machines, prohibition of password sharing) will be required of all study personnel. Virus protection software will be installed on each study machine as required on all VA computers. Backups will allow for quick restoration of data in the unlikely event that a hardware failure or security breach should occur. Participant paper files will be stored in locked cabinets in locked offices at all times  
33   F. Procedure We will encourage sites to screen all patients with the Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD) as a quality improvement measure.  Participants will be recruited into the trial in 1 of 3 ways:  • Direct referrals from clinicians (the clinician talks to a client about the study, either because the client has a history of trauma, symptoms of PTSD, or a positive PC-PTSD screen. If the client is interested, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168612]) • Self referrals (the patient sees the posted study information, talks to his/her therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168613], who contacts the site coordinator) • Indirect referrals (Research therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168614] a case and suggest that the clinician talk to the client about the study. If the client is interested, the clinician contacts the site coordinator.)  The individual who approaches the participant about the study (the site coordinator or provider) will give a copy of the information sheet and the informed consent document to the patient for review. The site coordinator or other designated local site personnel will consent all participants and give participants the “Volunteering to Participate” brochure. The information sheet will also be posted at the site  Every prospective participant will receive the 4-question PC-PTSD and this information will be retained for study purposes. We are requesting an Informed consent waiver for recruitment purposes and a HIPAA Waiver of documentation for recruitment purposes to facilitate the transfer of this information (see Form 103).  For sites that do not wish to implement routine screening, we will ask clinicians to refer interested patients to the site coordinator who will conduct the brief screen and invite those with a positive screen to participate. We will ask clinicians to refer patients who are [ADDRESS_196619] month, or unstable medical or legal problems. In cases where those doing the referring do not know the answers to our inclusion/exclusion criteria, we are asking for a HIPAA waiver to gather the inclusion/exclusion criteria from the medical record before informed consent. This will help us avoid approaching patients who would turn out to be not eligible. It will lessen patient burden, and help get participants into the study more quickly. The only information gathered at this time will be that needed for inclusion/exclusion. And this data will be retained securely double-locked at the site. Once the screening is completed and informed consent is signed, a trained, blind, assessor will confirm a PTSD diagnosis with the CAPS. Patients who do not meet criteria for PTSD on the CAPS will be paid $20 (form of payment determined by [CONTACT_168665]) and will not be enrolled in the study. Patients with PTSD will be given the SCID to confirm their SUD and other Axis [ADDRESS_196620] of the eligibility and baseline measures. Patients will receive an additional $30  for completing the baseline assessment, for a total of $50 for the baseline. Individuals providing consent and meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria as confirmed by [CONTACT_168666]. We will perform block randomization (block size of 2, 4, and 6) in allocating subjects to treatments. Moreover, stratified block assignment will be used, so that each treatment group will be balanced on type of substance use (alcohol only versus drug with or without alcohol, 2 categories), whether the patient has severe PTSD (2 categories), and the site of treatment (2 sites).  
[ADDRESS_196621] assessments all participants will receive the 6 month follow-up assessment. Assessors will be blind to treatment condition. Patients will be paid $[ADDRESS_196622] appointment (and about subsequent appointments if requested.) Patients who miss a session of treatment or assessment may be sent a letter of contact, if study staff are unable to reach them by [CONTACT_648]. G. Data Analysis  This study is designed as a two-arm, parallel comparison of two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168615] a VA intensive outpatient program for substance abuse or patients with comorbid substance use and PTSD. In designing this study, there are analysis issues that require special attention, such as handling of missing data, adjustment for loss-to-follow-up, and serial correlation for sample size calculation. The strategy for data analysis flows from the goals of the study, and in turn defines the statistical tests and sample size projections.  The unit of analysis is the participant. All analyses will be initially conducted according to intention-to-treat, i.e., participants’ data will be analyzed according to their assigned group regardless of their actual exposure to treatment. Prior to analysis, we will carefully examine descriptive statistics and the distributional form of all variables. We will use appropriate transformations, recode or categorize skewed and abnormally distributed data, and use appropriate methods for outliers and missing data so that we do not violate assumptions of our statistical procedures. Imputation techniques for missing data, such as linear interpolation and multiple imputations will be examined to determine their effect on the results. It is recognized, however, that the best approach to missing data is to make all effort to minimize it, since imputation is difficult when the missing data are non-ignorable or not missing at random. Our aim is to use careful examination and planned procedures so that we minimize the number of statistical tests, thereby [CONTACT_168667]. Therefore, for tests of hypotheses [ADDRESS_196623] adjustment of alphas (from .05) as the analysis and hypotheses have been planned and stated a priori. 1. The effects of CBT on patient outcomes  Hypothesis 1 (primary): Patients exposed to CBT will have greater improvements in PTSD symptom severity relative to patients who receive TAU as measured by [CONTACT_168668], and secondarily by [CONTACT_77514], from baseline to post-treatment and 6 month follow-up.  Hypothesis 2 (secondary): Patients receiving the CBT will have greater reductions in substance use severity (drugs and/or alcohol) relative to patients who receive TAU as measured by [CONTACT_168669], and secondarily by [CONTACT_75236], from baseline to post-treatment and [ADDRESS_196624]-treatment and 6-month outcomes using t-tests (chi-square test for retention proportion) and use multiple linear and logistic regression models to examine predictors of outcome. Demographic variables, baseline severity, and medical and psychiatric comorbidities will be considered as possible covariates. Only covariates that significantly reduce variance will be added to the model. Because the groups are randomized to be equivalent at baseline, the t-tests and end-point linear regression or logistic regression analyses are valid methods of comparison; however, patients who fail to provide any outcome data (at post-treatment and 6-months) measurement will naturally get excluded from the analyses, and this may introduce bias in the estimates. Furthermore, end-point analyses do not take into account the longitudinal nature of the data, time-varying covariates, or correlations among repeated observations.  For our main analysis, we will perform both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses using Generalized Linear Mixed Model (SAS PROC MIXED) for continuous outcomes (for example, primary hypothesis) and PROC GLIMMIX for binary outcomes. We will model changes over time at population level. We will examine the 
[ADDRESS_196625] no significant site main effects or site by [CONTACT_9900], but this will be examined. Although estimating the covariance structures is not a goal of the analyses, we will examine the model fit using different covariance structures as appropriate covariance structure is necessary for valid inferences about fixed effects. Once again, only those covariates that significantly reduce error variance will be added to the model. Demographic variables, baseline scores, baseline symptom severity, and site will be considered as possible covariates. We will plot predicted means for the groups over time, and for each site, along with confidence intervals. Some simple parametric (e.g. linear or quadratic) curves will be used to describe the changes over time of the mean response. The fitting of parsimonious models for the mean response will result in statistical tests of covariate effect (e.g. treatment by [CONTACT_25218]) that have greater power than, for example, in analysis of response profiles.95 If the mean response changes in an approximately linear fashion over the duration of the study, we will adopt the following linear trend model Hypothesis 1 and 2: E(Yij) = β1 + β2Timeij + β3 Groupi + β4Timeij*Groupi [INVESTIGATOR_168616] = 1 if the ith individual was assigned to the CBT treatment, and Groupi = 0 otherwise; and Timeij denotes the measurement time for the jth measurement on the ith individual.  Our primary interest concerns a comparison of the changes in the mean response over time, which is a comparison of the slopes. The slope, or the rate of change in the mean response per unit change in time, is β2 in the control group, and (β2 + β4) in the treatment group. Thus, if β4 is not significantly different from 0, then the two groups do not differ in terms of changes in their mean response over time.  Assuming that the changes in the mean response can be approximated by [CONTACT_168670], the following model can be adopted: E(Yij) = β1 + β2Timeij + β3Time2ij + β3 Groupi + β5TimeijXGroupi + β6Time2ijXGroupi [INVESTIGATOR_168617], we will contrast of the group population means across time points. For example, mean difference μ1 – μ2   is likely to be [ADDRESS_196626] of treatments, mean difference might be 10 (on the CAPS scale) at end of study. We would like to test whether this change in mean difference is significant. This is our hypothesis 1 and 2. 2. The effects of CBT on retention Hypothesis 3 (secondary): Patients who receive CBT will have better retention in the addiction treatment program relative to patients who receive TAU as measured by [CONTACT_168671]. For patients in IOPs, we will calculate the proportion of substance abuse treatment completed as a percentage of the full treatment. Using this completion proportion as our dependent variable, we will conduct a multivariate linear regression analysis that includes variables such as treatment assignment, demographic information, and baseline symptom severity as potential covariates, for example: E(Yj) = β1 +  β2 Groupi + β3CAPSi0 + β3AGEi0 + β4SEXi0  Where i0 stands for the ith individual’s measurement at baseline (time=0).If, for example, β2 is not significantly different from 0, then the two groups do not differ in terms of completion proportion when adjusted for age, gender, and baseline symptom severity as measured by [CONTACT_88853]. Data on utilization and retention will be extracted from medical records using CAPRI or JLV. The HIPPA Authorization and the Informed Consent both clearly state that this information will be obtained from their medical records.

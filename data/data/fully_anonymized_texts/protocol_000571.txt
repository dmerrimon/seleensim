 Précis  
 
While combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved the clinical outcome for 
HIV-infected individuals, persistence of viral reservoirs in the peripheral blood and 
lymphoid tissues remain s a hurdle to complete eradication of virus and cure of the 
infection . The concept that HIV preferentially infects discrete subsets of CD4+ T cells 
underscores the need to develop therapeutics that exploit specific cell -virus 
interactions. T cells expressing integrin 47 not only regulate migration into the gut -
associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), but also concomitantly bind HIV, placing them in a 
prime position to disseminate HIV throughout the tissue . Previously, it has been show n 
that the HIV envelope protein gp120 binds to 47 on CD4+ T cells in vitro , 47high 
CD4+ T cells are highly susceptible to productive HIV infection in vitro , and the 
administration of anti -47 monoclonal  antibody (mAb) prevents and/or delays 
transmission of SIV upon repeated challenges and preserves CD4+ T cells in rhesus 
macaques. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that administration of anti -4[ADDRESS_767602] 
targeting of 4[ADDRESS_767603] to 
investigate whether administration of anti-4[ADDRESS_767604] of vedolizumab, an FDA -
approved anti-47 mAb for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, on 
plasma viral rebound in HIV -infected individuals following analytical treatment 
interruption (ATI).  
Protocol Version 5.[ADDRESS_767605] demonstrated that  HIV persists in latently infected, 
CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood of virtually all infected individuals receiving clinically 
effective cART 6-8. In a ddition, recent studies suggest that low levels of HIV replication 
may persist even in the absence of detectable viremia5,9,10. As plasma v iremia appears 
to rebound in nearly all HIV-infected individuals upon cessation of cART regardless of 
duration and timing of therapy11-13, alternative therapeutic strategies aimed at 
destroying or permanently suppressing persistently infected cells are need ed to 
potentially eradicate HIV 14. 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_583789], the 
burden of taking daily medication for life, long -term toxicity of cART regimens, and 
potential resistance to antiretroviral drugs, necessitates a continued search for effective 
alternatives for the control of HIV infection. Consequently, a major thrust of HIV 
research over the past several years has been to develop therapeutic strategies that 
target the persisten t HIV reservoir  and could induce a  sustained virologic remission in 
infected individuals in the absence of cART. To this end, numerous attempts have been 
made to purge the persistent HIV reservoir in infected individuals receiving cART . 
These include the u se of non -specific immune -activating agents, such as IL -2 15 and an 
anti-CD3 antibody 16, as well as  histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as valproic acid 
and vorinostat 17,18. However, these reagents neither prevented plasma viral rebound 
following cessation of cART nor decreased the size of the persistent viral reservoir in 
HIV-infected individuals . 
 
Other therapeutic strategies aimed at achieving eradication are under investigation. 
These include genetic manipulation of CD4+ T cells [ADDRESS_767606] revealed a potential access point via 
Protocol Version 5.0

 engagement of the cell surface integrin 47 by [CONTACT_583810]120 on CD4+ T cells30,31. The 
4[ADDRESS_767607]. Integrin 47 mediates 
homing of T lymphocy tes to the gut by [CONTACT_583811] -1 (MAdCAM -1), an adhesion molecule preferentially expressed on venules in 
gut associated lymphoid tissue  (GALT) . 
 
In addition to preferentially migrating to GALT , α4β7high CD4+ T are highly susceptible to 
productive HIV infection in vitro .  Furthermore, it has been shown that  α4β7  integrin on 
CD4+ T cells binds HIV gp120  leading to rapid activation of LFA -1, the integrin involved 
in the establishment of virologi c synapses 30,31. Thus, α4β7high CD4+ T cells are  in a 
prime p osition to disseminate HIV between GALT and the periphery. Based on these 
observations, the efficacy of  47-mAb therapy in preventing transmission was 
evaluated in a nonhuman primate model 32. Initial results revealed that  administration  
anti-47 mAb  prior to and during acute infection protected rhesus macaques from 
transmission after repeated low -dose intravaginal challenges with SIVmac251 . In the 
treated animals that became infected, GALT was protected from infection and CD4+ T 
cells were maintained  in both the periphery and GALT32. These results suggest that 
antibodies directed against 4[ADDRESS_767608]  potential as an immune -based therapy for 
HIV.  
 Description of the Study Agent   
Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the α4β7 integrin and blocks the interaction of α4β7 integrin with MAdCAM -1, which in turn  
inhibits the migration of T -lymphocytes across the endothelium into GALT . Vedolizumab 
does not bind to or inhibit function of the α4β1 and αEβ7 integrins and does not antagonize the interaction of α4 integrins with vascular cell adhesion molecule -1 
(VCAM -1). 
 
Consist ent with its specificity for α4β7 , IV administration of vedolizumab  did not elevate 
neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, B helper and cytotoxic T  lymphocytes, total memory 
T helper lymphocytes, monocytes or NK cells in the peripheral blood  of healthy subje cts 
or subjects with  UC or  CD (Vedolizumab Investigators Brochure, Dec. 2015) . 
Vedolizumab did not affect immune surveillance and inflammation of the central 
nervous sy stem ( CNS ) in experimental autoimmune encephalitis  in nonhuman  
primates, a model of multiple sclerosis
33. Consistent with these results, vedolizumab IV 
did not alter the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells or the number of T cells in the CSF of 
healthy subjects34. Vedolizumab IV did not inhibit the  adaptive immune response to 
intramuscular antigen challenge with  hepatitis B vaccine in healthy subjects, but did 
inhibit an adaptive immune response to oral  antigen challenge with killed cholera toxin 
vaccine35. These results support t he conclusion that, unlike natalizumab (a duel α4β7  
and α 4β1 antagonist), vedolizumab selectively inhibits  migration of T lymphocytes to 
the gut and does not inhibit central nervous system or systemic immune response s in 
humans.  
 
Clinical Pharmacology  
The single and multiple dose  pharmacokinetics  (PK) of vedolizumab IV have been 
investigated  in completed studies in  healthy subjects and in subjects with moderately to 
severely active UC or CD . Similar PK was observed in healthy subjects, as well as in 
subjects with UC or CD. Vedolizumab  clearance  depends on both linear and nonlinear 
Protocol Version 5.0

Page 13 of 53 
 pathways; with linear PK observed at serum  concentrations >1 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL. 
Population PK analyses indicate that the linear clearance  was approximately 0.157 
L/day, the serum terminal  elimination half -life was approximately 25 days at the 300 mg 
dosage, and the  volume of distribution at steady state  was approximately 5 L. 
Vedolizumab was not detected in the CSF of 14 healthy subjects at  5 weeks after a 
single intravenous ( IV) administration of 450 mg vedolizumab (1.5 times the 
recommended  dosage) . 
 
Clinical Pharmacodynamics  
 
Two pharmacodynamic  markers (Act- 1 and MAdCAM -1-Fc) were independently 
evaluated to assess the  presence of 47 integrin binding sites on cell surfaces and to 
determine the number of free 4[ADDRESS_767609] -1 and  MAdCAM -1-Fc binding to the 47 receptor indicated the extent 
of 47 receptor saturation by  [CONTACT_240153]36. 
Dose -dependent duration of 47 receptor saturation was consistently observed 
following both  single and multiple dosing in phase 1 studies. Rapid and near complete 
47 receptor saturation  was achieved following dosing and the time to loss of 47 
receptor saturation was dose  dependent.  The serum concentrations of vedolizumab 
following 300 mg dosing every 4 -8 weeks  are expected to maintain >90% α4
 7 
receptor binding saturation over the dosing interval in >90% of  subjects36,37.  
 Summary of Pre- Clinical Nonhuman Primate Studies  
 
Based on the  results  of the nonhuman primate studies demonstrating efficacy of anti -
47 mAb in preventing  SIV infection  (see Section 1.1) , a follow -up study  was designed 
to investigate  the potential therapeutic effects of anti -47 mAb  in SIV infected 
macaques  (A. Ansari unpublished data) . The anti-47 mAb used in these studies 
contains the same antigen binding region as vedolizumab fused to a rhesus IgG1 Fc  
region38.  In this study, 10 rhesus macaques were infected with SIVmac239 
intravenously. When the animals reached steady state viremia, they were initiated on 
cART. Once viral levels were suppressed  on cART, the monkeys were divided into two 
groups ; the control group received  50 mg/kg  IV of normal rhesus IgG, while group 2 
received 50 mg/kg IV of  anti-4[ADDRESS_767610] of anti -47 mAb  alone  on the expected rebound of plasma viremia   
(Figure 1.1.2 -1).  
 
As expected, all five animals in the IgG control group experienced a rebound of viremia 
within [ADDRESS_767611], 4/5 monkeys in the anti -47 mAb group 
exhibited intermittent or continued suppression of plasma viremia  (Figure 1.1.2 -1). In 
these animals, suppression of plasma viremia persisted, in the absence of cART 
through week 45  ([ADDRESS_767612] anti -47 mAb).  The single animal in the  anti-
47 mAb group (RNo13) that exhibited rebound viremia was shown to have 
developed antibodies against the 4[ADDRESS_767613] u d y w a s d e si g n e d i n t h e s a m e m a n n er wit h t h e a d diti o n of 8 a ni m al s, 2 of

 Summary of Relevant Clinical Studies  
 
Vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) is approved by [CONTACT_583812]  (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD) who have 
had an inadequate response to, or were intolerant to a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
blocker or immunomodulator; or had an inadequate response with, were intolerant to, or  
demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids. The FDA approval was based largely on 
the results of 2  two integrated  randomized controlled studies  in UC39 and 2 integrated 
randomized controlled studies in CD40.  In these studies, the dose of vedolizumab was 
300 mg IV.  
 
Ulcerative Colitis  (UC)  
In a randomized, multicenter trial, 374 patients with active UC were assigned to 
vedolizumab or placebo for the induction of remission39. A significantly greater 
proportion of vedolizumab -treated patients achieved clinical response, remission, and 
mucosal healing at six weeks compared with  placebo. In a trial of vedolizumab for the 
maintenance of remission, 373 patients with a clinical response to vedolizumab at six 
weeks, in either the induction trial or following open label treatment, were assigned to 
continue to receive vedolizumab every eight weeks, four weeks, or switch to placebo for 
up to 52 weeks. At week 52, remission rates were significantly higher in patients who received vedolizumab compared with placebo.  
 
Crohn’s Disease  (CD)  
A randomized trial enrolling  [ADDRESS_767620] one conventional therapy were assigned to vedolizumab or placebo 
for induction therapy40. At week 6, rates of clinical remission were significantly higher in 
patients treated with vedolizumab as compared with placebo (14 versus 7 percent). 
This same trial also looked at the ability of vedolizumab to maintain remission. A total 
[ADDRESS_767621] exposure to vedolizumab in patients 
participating in the  four Phase 3 trials39,40. In these trials, 1,434 patients received 
vedolizumab  300 mg for up to 52 weeks, and 297 patients  received placebo for up to 52 
weeks. Of these, 769 patients had UC and 962  patients had CD . Patients were exposed 
for a mean duration of 259 days ( UC) and 247 days ( CD). In these studies, concomitant 
treatment with stable doses of prednisone and/or  immunosuppressive agents were 
allowed. Adverse reactions were reported in 52% of patients treated with vedolizumab  
and 45% of patients  treated with placebo. Serious adverse reactions were reported  in 
7% of patients treated with vedolizumab  compared to 4% o f patients treated with 
placebo.   
 The most common adverse reactions  were nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, 
nausea, pyrexia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_583790], fatigue, cough, bronchitis, influenza, 
back pain, rash, pruritus, sinusitis,  oropharyngeal pain and pain in extremities (Table 
1.1.3 -1).

Laboratory Abnormalities  
No clinically important treatment group differences in patients with markedly abnormal 
values in  laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry , or coagulation)  were observed in any 
of the phase [ADDRESS_767622] been 
reported in clinical trials. In the UC and CD phase III trials described above, a single 
case of anaphylaxis (1/1434 subjects -0.07%) was reported in a patient with CD 
following the second infusion of vedolizumab. In these same trials, other infusion -
related reactions were reported in 4% of patients treated with vedolizumab and 3% of 
patients treated with placebo. The most common reactions w ere nausea, headache, 
pruritus, dizzine ss, fatigue, pyrexia, urticaria , and vomiting. These reactions generally 
occurred during the infusion, and reso lved either with no treatment or  following 
administration of antihistamine and/or hydrocortisone. Less tha n 1% of patients treated 
with vedolizumab developed infusion reactions assessed by [CONTACT_583813].  

Protocol Version 5.[ADDRESS_767623] frequently reported serious infection in CD  patients. Over 48 months, 
there was no increase in the rate of  serious infections.  Sepsis was reported in 4 of 1434 
(0.3%) of patients treated with vedolizumab compared with 2 of 297 (0.7%). patients 
treated  with placebo.  
 
In controlled - and open -label long -term extension trials in adults treated with 
vedolizumab , serious infections have been reported, including anal abscess, sepsis 
(some fatal),  tuberculosis, salmonella sepsis, Listeria meningitis, giardiasi s, and 
cytomegalovirus  colitis.  No cases of PML were reported.  
 
Liver Injury  
In the UC and CD phase III trials there were reports of elevations in hepatic 
transaminases and/or bilirubin. Three patients in the UC and CD trials reported SAE 
related to hepatitis. Based on case report information, it is unclear  if these SAE were 
related to concomitant medication s (e.g. 6 -mercaptopurine)  or autoimmune processes  
(sclerosing cholangitis) . All patients recovered. In controlled trials, ALT/AST elevations  
≥3 X upper limit of normal  were seen i n <2% of patients in both the placebo and  
vedolizumab groups .  
 
Immunogenicity  
In the completed 52 -week controlled studies in subjects with UC or CD, vedolizumab IV 
showed  an immunogenicity rate of 4%; 56 of 1434 subjects who received continuous 
treatment with  vedolizumab IV tested positive for anti -vedolizumab antibodies at any 
time during treatment . Nine of these 56 subjects  were persistently positive (positive at 
≥2 study visits) and 33 subjects developed  neutralizing antibodies. As with all 
therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. In UC Trials I and II and CD 
Trials I and III, in patients who received vedolizumab , the frequency of antibodies 
detec ted in patients was 13% at [ADDRESS_767624] dose of study drug (greater 
than five half -lives after last dose) . 
 
Overall, there was no apparent correlation of anti-vedolizumab antibodies , clinical 
response , or treatment related AE . However, the numbe r of subjects who developed 
antibodies  was too limited to make a definitive  assessment.  
 
Post  Marketing Experience  
Based on drug shipment data as of [ADDRESS_767625] been identified  (vedolizumab 
Investigators Brochure,  Dec. 2015) . 
Protocol Version 5.[ADDRESS_767626] that 
blockade of 47 with vedolizumab in virologically suppressed patients with HIV 
infection has the potential to ind uce sustained suppression of viremia after 
discontinuation of cART  and anti -4[ADDRESS_767627] this hypothesis and evaluate the safety of vedolizumab in an exploratory open 
label study.  
 
Use of Analytical Treatment Interruption  (ATI)  
Various assays measuring HIV -specific immune responses  and the  frequency of CD4+ 
T cells carrying infectious HIV  have been used to assess efficacy of immune -based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . To date, none of the assays are clinically  validated to predict actual antiviral 
efficacy. Thus, ATI has been used to evaluate the anti-viral efficacy  of immune -based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_583791] . The use of ATI in the design of this 
study  is the only way to determine if administration of v edolizumab  results in clinically 
significant antiviral activity , as evidenced by a blunted or absent plasma viral rebound 
following ATI.  
2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of vedolizumab in HIV -
infected individuals prior to and following analytical  treatment 
interruption (ATI)  
 
2.2 Secondary Objective  
• To evaluate the effect of vedolizumab administration on plasma 
viral rebound in HIV -infected individuals following ATI  
2.3 Exploratory Objectives  
• To determine the effect of vedolizumab on the size of persistent 
HIV reservoirs  
 
• To examine the impact of vedolizumab on continuing /residual 
HIV replication prior to discontinuation of cART  
[ADDRESS_767628] of 
vedolizumab  on plas ma viral rebound in HIV -infected individuals following an 
analytical treatment interruption (ATI). Fifteen  HIV-infected individuals with 
suppressed viremia on  cART will be studied. All study participants will receive  a 
total of 9  IV infusions of vedolizuma b 300 mg  (Figure 1.1.3 -1).

At study week 22 , all subjects will discontinue cART and enter the ATI phase of the 
study . Individuals taking non -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) 
will switch to a protease inhibitor or an integrase inhibitor -based regimen  at least  2 
weeks prior to week 22  to ensure that the washout period of antiretroviral agents is 
roughly  equal.  HIV plasma viral levels and CD4+ T cell counts will be monitored 
every [ADDRESS_767629]  meet s any of the following criteria 
between study weeks 22 -30, they will  discontinue vedolizumab infusions,  re-start 
ART, and enter the follow -up phase. Subjects who meet any of the criteria for 
restarting cART after week 30, will restart cART and enter the follow -up phase.  
 
 
Criteria to Restart cART

Dilution Instructions  
Add the 5 mL (300 mg) of reconstituted vedolizumab solution to 250 mL of sterile 0.9% 
sodium  chloride and gently mix the inf usion bag. Do not add other medicinal products to 
the prepared  infusion solution or intravenous infusion set. Once reconstituted and 
diluted, use the infusion  solution as soon as possible.  
 
Storage  
If necessary, the infusion solution may be stored for up t o four hours at 2° to 8°C (36º to 
46ºF).  Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution.  
 
The dose of vedolizumab  for this study is [ADDRESS_767640] has been obtained within the previous 24 hours. Prior 
to each administration, temperature, blood pressure, heart  rate (pulse) and weight will 
be recorded . Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure,  heart rate) will be measured [ADDRESS_767641] will be monitored for 1 hour after completion of the infusion.  
 Dose Adjustments and Modifications  
Should m ild-moderate infusion -related symptoms  (Grade I -II) develop, they will be 
managed by [CONTACT_86964][INVESTIGATOR_583792]. For 
symptoms such as fever, myalgia,  or urticaria,  symptomatic treatment with  standard 
doses of acetaminophen or antihistamines  may be given. Once symptoms have 
resolved, the infusion will be restarted  at half the initial rate. If symptoms recur  following  
a reduced infusion rate and symptomatic treatment, the infusion will again be stopped 
until symptoms resolved and restarted at a lower ra te. If the infusio n cannot be 
completed within a 3 -hour time frame because of recurrent symptoms, the infusion will 
be discontinued for that visit.

 • Leukapheresis for research  studies will be done within 14 days after  the study 
week 10  and 22  visits (prior to beginning ATI)  
• HIV transmission risk behavior assessment and counseling  
 
Analytical Treatment Interruption  
Following the  study week 22  visit, all su bjects will discontinue cART .  During the ATI , 
additional CD4+ T cell  count , storage of plasma,  and plasma HIV RNA levels will be  
obtained such that subjects will have these parameters  monitored every 2 weeks  during 
the ATI . Genotypic analysis for drug resistance mutations will be performed on all 
plasma samples with HIV viral levels >1,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml. For select subjects residing 
outside the local (Bethesda, MD) area, blood samples for CD4+ T cell counts , and HIV 
viral levels , may be collected at their local clinics or Quest Diagnostics and sent to the 
NIH Clinical Center for testing .  Samples collected at clinics or at Quest may be labeled 
with a coded identifier, gender, and date of birth, as required by [CONTACT_247764].  
 
If a subject develops one or more criteria for ending ATI  (see section 3.1) he/she  will be 
asked to return for assessment and confirmation of the laboratory/cli nical abnormality. If 
the criteria for ending ATI are met,  no further vedolizumab  infusions will be given , and  
the subject will  be instructed to  restart cART . He/she will  then undergo the schedule of 
procedures described  in Section 6.4.   At week 48, any subject  who has not met criteria 
to end the ATI but has  detectable  viremia (>40 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) will be instructed to restart 
cART. All subjects will  be followed for [ADDRESS_767644] detectable  (>40 co pi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) viremia at week [ADDRESS_767645] to remain off 
cART  and will be followed  until viremia becomes detectable.  For such subjects, 
laboratory studies will be continued per the schedule outlined in Section 6.3 (except for 
the collection of serum for s torage) until viremia is detected; at which time they will be 
instructed to restart cART and be followed  as outlined in Section 6.4.  
6.[ADDRESS_767646] will enter the follow -up phase of the study. After 
restarting cART, s ubjects will be seen every 4 weeks  for 24 wee ks. At these visits, 
subjects will undergo the following procedures:

Identified Risks  
 
Infusion -Related Reactions  
In the completed 52 -week controlled studies in subjects with UC or CD , 4% of 
vedolizumab treated  subjects and 3% of placebo -treated subjects experienced infusion -
related reactions as  defined by [CONTACT_11168]39,40. The majority of reactions  were mild 
or moderate in intensity and <1%  resulted in discontinuation of study treatment. 
Observed infusion -related reactions  generally resolved with no or  minimal intervention 
following the infusion .  Most reactions  were not serious and occurred during the infusion 
or within the first hour after  infusion was completed.  
 
 
Upper Respi[INVESTIGATOR_583793] e of the most common 
infectious treatment emergent AE seen across the clinical studies  of vedolizumab . In 
the Phase III  studies39,40, there was an overall rate of upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_583794] 
24% in vedolizumab -treated subjects  compare d with 17% in the placebo -treated 
subjects  (see Section 1.1.3) . The most commonly reported diagnosis  included  
nasopharyngitis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], pharyngitis, and sinusitis.  
 
 
Potential Risks of Vedolizumab Treatment  
 
Serious Infections, Including Opportunistic Infections  
In the completed [ADDRESS_767649], has been associated with PML, a 
rare and often fatal opportunistic infection of the CNS41. PML is caused by [CONTACT_583816] (JCV) and typi[INVESTIGATOR_583795]. Natalizumab is a pan -[ADDRESS_767650] -marketing experience w ith vedolizumab to date  (over 11,943 
patient -years) , a risk of PML cannot be ruled out.  
 
 
Analytical treatment interruption  
The risks from an ATI, performed under close virologic  and immunological monitoring 
are minimal in this subject population. There is a theoretical risk that ATI could lead to 
the development of HIV drug resistance. This may be a particular concern for 
individuals taking NNRTIs. However, this potential risk wi th NNRTIs is essentially 
eliminated by [CONTACT_583817]  3.144. Given the study 
population, the frequency of immunological and virologic  monitoring, and strict criteria

 others may benefit from knowledge gained in this study that may aid in the 
development  better  HIV treatments . 
 
9 Research Use of Stored Human Samples, Specimens , or 
Data  
 
• Intended Use: Stored blood samples and data collected under this protocol may 
be used to study the effect of vedolizumab on the virologic and immunologic 
parameters listed in Section 7.2.1. Samples may be used to study other aspects 
of the immunopathogenesis of HIV infe ction or measure serum levels of 
vedolizumab and antiretr oviral agents . Coded samples and demographic data 
will be sent to [COMPANY_005] -Millennium Pharmaceuticals and its vendor, QPS for PK 
and immunogenicity studies.  
• Storage:  Access to stored samples will be l imited using a locked room or a 
locked freezer. Samples and data will be stored using codes assigned by [CONTACT_4520]. Data will be kept in password -protected computers. Only 
investigators will have access to the samples and data.  
 
• Tracking: Samples wi ll be tracked utilizing the NCI at Frederick Central 
Repository . Data will be stored and maintained in the NIAID CRIMSON 
database.  
 
• Disposition at the Completion of the Protocol: At the completion of the 
protocol (termination), samples and data will either be destroyed, or after IRB 
approval, transferred to another existing protocol.  
 
• Reporting the Loss or Destruction of Samples/Specimens/Data to the IRB:  
o Any loss or unanticipated  destruction of samples or data (for example, 
due to freezer malfunction) that meets the definition of Protocol 
Deviation and/or compromises the scientific integrity of t he data 
collected for the study,  will be reported to the NIAID IRB.  
o Subjects may decide at any point not to have their samples stored.  In 
this case, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_434660].  
This de cision will not affect the subject’s participation in this protocol or 
any other protocols at NIH (If applicable) . 
10 Remuneration Plan for Subjects  
Eligible subjects will be compensated for travel according to the NIAID/NIH travel 
policy. Subjects will rece ive financial compensation for time and inconvenience 
according to the NIH C C volunteer guidelines: screening ($50), 2-pass 
leukapheresis ($200 for a procedure ; $50 for unsuccessful apheresis attempts ), 
research blood draw ($40), clinic visits ($30), vedol izumab infusion ($80).   If 
subject does not qualify or declines leukapheresis, an additional [ADDRESS_767651] may be compensated an additional $[ADDRESS_767652], information regarding AEs will be elicited 
by [CONTACT_245151], and it will be:  
• Immediately documented in the electronic database and medical record.  
• Reported as outlined below  (e.g., IND sponsor, IRB, Food and Drug 
Administration [FDA]).  
11.2 Definitions  
Adverse event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the subject’s 
participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the 
research.  
 
Adverse reaction (AR)  
An adverse reaction (AR) is an AE that is caused by [CONTACT_4523] 
(drug or biologic).  
 
Suspected adverse reaction (SAR)  
A suspected AR (SAR) is an AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the investigational agent caused the AE. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means that 
there is evidence to sug gest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about the causality than an 
AR, which implies a high degree of certainty.  
 
Serious adverse event  (SAE)   
An SAE is an AE that results in one or more of the fo llowing  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening (i.e., an immediate threat to life) event  
• An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct norm al life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• A medically important event*  
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical 
events that may not  be immediately life threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but they may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
 
Unexpected adverse event  
An AE is unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure  or package  
insert (for marketed products), or it is not listed at the specificity or severity 
that has been observed. It is the responsibility of the IND sponsor to make this 
determination.  
 
Protocol Version 5.0  
22-March -2017 
 
Page 34 of 53 
 Serious and unexpected sus pected adverse reaction  
A serious and unexpected suspected AR (S[LOCATION_003]R) is a SAR that is both 
serious and unexpected.   
 
Unanticipated problem  
An unanticipated problem (UP) is an event, incident, experience, or outcome 
that is —  
1. Unexpected in terms of natu re, severity, or frequency in relation to — 
a. The research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; investigator’s brochure, or 
other study documents; and  
b. The characteristics of the subject population being  studied; and  
2. Related  or possibly  to participation in the research; and  
3. Suggests the research p laces subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized (per the  IND sponsor, an AE with a 
serious outcome will be considered increased risk).  
 
Unanticipated problem that is not an adverse event  
An unanticipated problem that is not an AE is  an incident, experience, or 
outcome that is not associated with an AE, which m eets the 3 criteria of a UP. 
Examples include breaches of confidentiality, accidental destruction of study 
records, and unaccounted -for study drug.  
 
Protocol Deviation  
Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved study 
procedures in a research protocol. Protocol deviations are designated as 
serious or non -serious and further characterized as:  
 
• Those that occur because a member of the research team deviates from the 
protocol  
• Those that are identified before they occur, but cannot be prevented  
• Those that are discovered after they occur  
 
 
Serious Protocol Deviation:  A deviation that meets the definition of a 
Serious Adverse Event or compromises the safety, welfare or rights of 
subjects or others.  
 
Non-compliance: The failure to comply w ith applicable NIH HRPP policies, 
IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human 
subjects. Non -compliance is further characterized as:  
1. Serious: Non -compliance that  
a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants  
b. Decreases potenti al benefits to participants  
c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH -HRPP  
d. Invalidates the study data  
2. Continuing: Non -compliance that is recurring  
3. Minor: Non -compliance that, is neither serious nor continuing.

 Protocol specified events 
Protocol specified events  are AEs specified in the protocol that the principal 
investigator, IND sponsor, or medical monitor would like to review in real time 
rather than weeks or months later, when they would otherwise appear in 
various line listings. These events may or may not also be SAEs.  
11.3 Investigator Assessment of Adverse Events  
If a diagnosis is clinically evident (or subsequently determined), the diagnosis rather than the individual signs and symptoms or lab abnormalities will be 
recorded as the AE.  
 
All AEs occurring from the time when the first infusion  is administered through 
the specified study follow -up period  will be documented, recorded, and 
reported. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_583798]  (criteria listed a bove), Severity (intensity or grade), and 
Causality  (relationship to study agent and relationship to research) according 
to the following guidelines.  
 Severity  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_583799] 2.0, November, 2014, which can be found at

ABLE_v2_NOV2014.pdf  
 Causality    
Causality (likelihood that the event is related to the study agent) will be 
assessed considering the factors listed under the following categorie s:  
 
Definitely related     
• Reasonable temporal relationship  
• Follows a known response pattern  
• Clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship  
• There is no alternative etiology  
 
Probably related  
• Reasonable temporal relationship  
• Follows a suspected response pattern (based on similar agents)  
• No evidence of a more likely alternative etiology  
 
Possibly related   
• Reasonable temporal relationship  
• Little evidence for a more likely alternative etiology  
 
Unlikely related   
• Does not have a reasonable temporal relationship  
OR 
• Good evidence for a more likely alternative etiology  
Protocol Version 5.0 
22-March-2017  
 
Page 36 of 53 
  
Not related   
• Does not have a temporal relationship           
OR 
• Definitely due to an alternative etiology  
 
Note:    
Other factors (e.g., dechallenge, rechallenge) should also be considered for each causality category when appropriate. Causality assessment is based 
on available information at the time of the assessment of the AE. The 
investigator may revise the causality assessment as additional information 
becomes available.  
11.4 Inves tigator Reporting Responsibilities to the Sponsor  
   Adverse Events  
Line listings, frequency tables, and other summary AE data will be submitted to the IND sponsor per the Safety Review and Communications 
Plan (SRCP – see below), or as needed for periodic safety assessments, 
review of IND annual reports, review of IND safety reports, and preparation 
of final study reports.  
   Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs (whether or not they are also UPs) must be reported on the SAE/UP 
report form and sent to  the sponsor Clinical Safety Office (CSO) by [CONTACT_3719] e -

   Expedited Reporting to the NIAID IRB  
Serious and non -serious Unanticipated Problems, deaths, serious 
deviations, and serious or continuing non -compliance will be reported 
within 7 calendar days of investigator awareness. SAEs that are possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to the research will be reported to the NIAID 
IRB within 7 calendar days of investigator awareness, regardless of expectedness.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Waiver of Reporting Anticipated Protocol Deviations, Expected UP nonAEs and Deaths to the NIAID IRB  
 Anticipated deviations in the conduct of the protocol w ill not be 
subject to expedited  reporting  to the IRB unless they occur at a rate 
greater than anticipated by [CONTACT_3476]. Expected adverse events will not be reported to the IRB unless they occur at a rate 
greater than that known to occur in HIV(+) population. If the rate of 
these events exceeds the rate expected by [CONTACT_3476], the 
events will be classified and reported as though they are unanticipated problems . 
   Annual Reporting to the NIAID IRB   
The following items will be reported to the NIAID IRB in summary at the time of continuing review:  
• Serious and non -serious unanticipated problems  
• Expected serious adverse events that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the research  
• Serious adverse events that are not related to the research  
• All adverse events, except expected AEs and deaths granted a

vedolizumab ) are followed until the final outcome is  known or until the end of 
the study follow -up period.  
 
SAEs that  that are assessed by [CONTACT_1010], probably, or 
definitely related  to vedolizumab an d that have not resolved by [CONTACT_583819] -up period will be  followed until the final  outcome is known. If it is not 
possible to obtain a final outcome for an SAE (e.g.  the subject is lost to follow 
up), the reason a final outcome could not be obtained will be recorded by [CONTACT_583820]/UP report form.   
 
SAEs that occur after study completion that are reported to and are assessed 
by [CONTACT_1010], probably, or definitely related must be 
reported to the CSO, as desc ribed above.  
11.7 Sponsor’s Reporting Responsibilities  
S[LOCATION_003]Rs as defined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and 
determined by [CONTACT_583821].  
 
The IND sponsor wi ll also submit an IND annual report of the progress of the 
investigation to the FDA as defined in 21 CFR 312.33.  
11.8  Halting Criteria for the Protocol  
Halting the study requires immediate discontinuation of the study agents 
administered for all subjects and suspension of enrollment until a decision is 
made about whether or not to continue study agent administration.   
  
The halting criteria (as determine d by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_583800]) for this study include:  
• Any SAE or grade 4 AE that is possibly, probably, definitely related to the 
study agent; OR  
• Any safety issue that the study principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_316815].  
• Pre-defined futility criteria for virologic failure are met (see Section 13).  
 
Any related AE that is ≥ grade 3 (not including transient, subjective infusion -
related symptoms such as malaise, fatigue, headache, chills) will be reviewed 
within 48 hours of site awareness, by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_583801], 
Protocol Version 5.0

The IND Sponsor, in collabo ration w ith the P I will determine if it is safe to resume the 
study. The PI w ill notify the IRB of the decision on resump tion of the st udy. The 
sponsor will notify the FDA as soon as possible that the study has been  resumed after 
a halt.  
11.[ADDRESS_767657] in this study include:  
 
• A subject experience s an SAE or grade 3 or greater AE (not including 
transient, subjective infusion -related  symptoms such as malaise, fatigue, 
headache, chills, or total bilirubin in subjects taking atazanavir) that  is (as 
determined by [CONTACT_106507]) possibly, probably, or definitely related  to 
the study agent;  
OR 
 
• Any safety issue that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_583802] a single subject.  
 
The CSO , in collaboration with the PI, may also pause for an individual subject 
or the entire group if a safety concern is identified during routine aggregate 
data analysis.  
   Reporting of Pause If a pausing requirement is met, a description of the AE(s) or safety issue 
must be reported by [CONTACT_32816] [INVESTIGATOR_316817] e -mail within [ADDRESS_767658] will be withdrawn for any of the following:

11.12   Safety Oversight  
  Safety Review and C ommunications Plan (SRCP)  
Protocol Version 5.0 
22-March-2017  
 
Page 41 of 53 
 A Safety Review and Communication s Plan ( SRCP ) has been developed 
for the protocol. The SRCP is an internal communications document 
between the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_83118], which 
delineates the safety oversight responsibilities of the principal investigator , 
the CSO, and other stake holders. The SRCP also includes the overall plan 
for conducting periodic safety surveillance assessments.   
   Sponsor Medical Monitor  
A medical monitor, representing the IND sponsor (OCRPRO), has been 
appointed for the safety oversight in this clinical study. The sponsor medical 
monitor will be responsible for performing safety assessments as outlined in the SRCP.  
12 Clinical Monitoring Structure  
12.1 Site Monitoring Plan  
As per ICH -GCP 5.18 and FDA 21  CFR 312.50  clinical protocols are required 
to be adequately monitored by [CONTACT_4530]. This study monitoring will be conducted according to the  “NIAID Intramural Clinical Monitoring Guidelines ”. 
Monitors un der contract to the NIAID/
 OCRPRO  will visit the clinical research 
site to monitor aspects of the study in  accordance with the appropriate 
regulations and the approved protocol. The objectives of a monitoring visit will be: 1) to verify the existence of signed informed consent documents and documentation of the ICF process for each monitored subject; 2) to ver ify the 
prompt and accurate recording of all monitored data points, and prompt reporting of all SAEs; 3) to compare  CRIMSON data abstracts with individual 
subjects’ records and source documents (subjects’ charts, laboratory analyses 
and test results, physi cians’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, and any other 
relevant original subject information); and 4) to help ensure investigators’ are 
in compliance with the protocol. The monitors also will inspect the clinical site 
regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements (Office for Human 
Research Protections -OHRP , FDA ), and applicable guidelines (ICH -GCP) are 
being followed. During the monitoring visits, the investigator (and/or designee) 
and other study personnel will be available to discuss the study progress and 
monitoring visit.  
 
The investigator (and/or designee) will make study documents (e.g., consent 
forms, CRIMSON data abstracts , and pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583805], the FDA , the site monitors, 
and the NIAID staff for confirmation of the study data.  
 
A specific protocol monitoring plan will be discussed with the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_322063]. The plan will outline the 
frequency of monitoring visits based on such factors as study enrollment, data collection status and regulatory obligations.   
 
[ADDRESS_767660] 95% confidence interval for the probability of adverse events will be computed 
using the Clopper -Pearson method.  The primary efficacy outcome is rebound of 
plasma viremia requiring a restart of cART.  An exact 95% confidence interval will be 
computed for the rebound probability using the Clopper -Pearson method.  Changes 
from baseline in continuous measurements will be analyzed using paired t -tests or, if 
data are skewed, the Wilcoxon signed ra nk statistic.      
 
In term s of safety, a sample size of 20 patients provides a 96.1% chance of observing 
an adverse event of probability 15 % or greater.  Table 1.1.[ADDRESS_767661] row.  
0.025  0.050  0.075  0.100  0.125  0.150  
.397 .642 .790 .878 .931 .961 
 
 
The sample size for this study is 20 subjects with suppressed HIV viremia on cART. In 
the absence of a therapeutic intervention, it is expected that 100% of such subjects 
would experience a rebound in plasma HIV viremia; with a median time to rebound of [ADDRESS_767662] 95% confidence intervals for 
rebound probability given the observed number of rebounders in row [ADDRESS_767663] e, 2 of whom meet virologic criteria to 
restart cART by 30 weeks .  This translates to a beta (2,2) prior distribution for p, the 
probability of meeting virologic criter ia of failure by 30 weeks .  Futility is declared if the 
posterior probability that p exceeds 0.70, given the observed results, is 90% or greater.  
The futility boundary is shown in Table [ADDRESS_767664] as large as the 
figure in row 2  
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
9 10 11 12 12 13 14 15 16 16 17 18 
 
The probabilities of crossing this futility boundary are shown in Table 13-4 for different 
true probabilities.  
 
 
Table 13-4.  Row 2 shows the probability of crossing the futility threshold 
if the true 30 -week rebound probability is as shown in row 1.  
.50 .60 .70 .80 .90 .95 
.003 .021 .099 .339 .775 .953 
  
For instance, if the true 30 -week  probability of having plasma viral level > 1,000 is 0.50, 
the probability of crossing the futility boundary is only 0.00 3.  On the other hand, if the 
true 30- week  rebound probability is 0.9 5, the probability of crossing the futility boundary 
is 0.953 . 
 
14 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects  
14.[ADDRESS_767665]'s involvement in the research. Discussions about the 
research will provide essential information about the study and include 
purpose, duration, experimental procedures, alternatives, risks , and benefits.  
Subjects will be given the opportunity to ask questions and have them 
answered.  
The subjects will sign the informed consent document prior to undergoing any 
research procedures. The subjects may withdraw consent at any time 
throughout the course of the trial.  A copy of the informed consent document 
will be given to the subjects for their records. The researcher will document the 
signing of the consent form in the subject’s medical record. The rights and 
welfare of the subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_583823].  
 Non- English –Speaking Participants 
If a non- English speaking participant is unexpectedly eligible for enrollment, 
the participant will be provided with the CC Short Written Consent Form for 
Protocol Version 5.0  
22-March -2017 
 
Page 44 of 53 
 Non-English Speaking Research Participants in the participant’s native 
language and a verbal explanat ion of the purpose, procedures and risks of 
the study as described in MAS Policy M77 -2, NIH HRPP SOP 12 and 45 
CFR 46.117(b)(2) . The IRB -approved English consent form will serve as 
basis for the verbal explanation of the study. The investigator will obtain  an 
interpreter unless the investigator is fluent in the prospective participant’s 
language. Preferably, the interpreter will be someone who is independent of 
the participant (i.e., not a family member). Interpreters provided by [CONTACT_583824] r possible. The interpreters will translate the IRB -
approved English consent form verbatim and facilitate discussion between 
the participant and investigator.  
The IRB -approved English consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_218084] a witness to the oral presentation. The CC Short 
Written Consent Form will be signed by [CONTACT_4538] a witness who 
observed the presentation of information. The interpreter may sign the 
consent document as the witness and, in this case, will note “Int erpreter” 
under the signature [CONTACT_4548]. A copy of both signed forms will be provided to the 
participant to take home.  
The investigator obtaining consent will document the consent process in the 
participant’s medical record (CRIMSON) , including the name [CONTACT_583825]. Further, all instances of use of the CC Short Written Consent 
Form will be reported to the IRB at the time of annual review. If the CC 
Short Written Consent Form is used three times or more for the same 
language, this will be reported to the I RB immediately.  
 Illiterate English Speaking Participants  
As the majority of the patient populations from which the study participants 
are drawn are literate, written consent will typi[INVESTIGATOR_583806].  However, 
this population does have a significant rate of illiteracy, and oral consent will 
be obtained for illiterate participants as consistent with NIH  Medical

Study data will be maintained in CRIMSON and collected directly from subjects 
during study visits and telephone calls, or will be abstracted from subjects’ 
medical records. Source documents include all recordings of observations or 
notations of cli nical activities and all reports and records necessary to confirm

Appendix C: PML Checklis t 
▪ This c hecklist will be a dminister ed at specified visits as outlined in the schedule of 
events in the protocol and ad hoc for patient reported symptoms.  
▪ The purpose of this checklist is to identify a definite change in the patient’s 
neurological status from the previous evaluation.  
▪ For all positive subjective findings that are identified, the corresponding objective test 
must be performed . All positive subjective findings will be recorded as  an adverse 
event.  
▪ Subjects with  a definite change in neurological status  will be referred to  a neurologist 
for evaluation . Where possible, the proposed objective tests  will be used  to confirm a 
change that warrants referral.

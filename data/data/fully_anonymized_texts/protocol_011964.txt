Study Design  
This is  a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel -group, fixed-dose study designed to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment with SE P-4199 monotherapy given as 
200 mg/day or 400 mg/day compared with placebo for the treatment of major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_759846] I disorder (bipolar I depression) . The study is projected to randomize 
approximately 294 subjects (98  subjects per treatment group) in the US and Europe to one of 
3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (SEP-4199 200 mg/day or 400 mg/day , or placebo). 
In addition, a Japanese cohort will be included in the study to summarize efficacy and safety data for 
Japanese subjects with bipolar I depression. Approximately 45 subjects (15  subjects per treatment 
group) will be randomized in the Japanese cohort in a 1:1:1 ratio (SEP-4199 200 mg/day or 
400 mg/day, or placebo). 
The study will consist of Screening (up to 21 days), 6  weeks of treatment  (42 days) , and follow-up 
(7 [± 2] days after the last study drug dose) as shown in the following figure. If necessary, subjects may 
return to the clinic at any time for an unscheduled visit.

Screening Period (Day  -22 to -2) 
Informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any study procedures are performed for this 
study. Study eligibility criteria will be assessed dur ing this period, and subjects will be washed out from 
prior or concomitant medications, where applicable, prior to randomization. Psychotropic medications (eg, antipsychotic agents, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers) are to be discontinued as tolerated  and 
clinically appropriate at least  3 days prior to randomization. 
Per local clinical practice, subjects may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216328] 7  days during the Screening period. 
Further need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_759847]. 
Baseline (Day  -1) and Treatm ent Period (Day  1 through Day 42) 
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Screening will return to the study site on Day -1 for 
confirmation of screening evaluations as well  as completion of predose assessments. Eligible subjects 
(based on confirmation of study entry criteria) will be randomized and dispensed study drug at Day  -1. 
Per local clinical practice, subjects may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216328] [ADDRESS_1040581] wee k of 
treatment with double-blind study drug. Further need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_759848]. 
Subjects will self -administer the study drug on an outpatient basis once daily with or without food 
beginning on Day 1 (the day after the Baseline visit) and continue for 6  weeks  (the last dose of study 
drug will be self -administered by [CONTACT_759886] 6). Subjects  will be 
instructed to administer study drug as a single oral dose in the morning at approximately the same time 
each day. Clinic visits are to be gin no later than 6 hours postdose, if possible. 
During the baseline (Day  -1) and treatment period  (Days  1 to 42) , subjects will have clinic visits at 
Days  -1, 7, 14, and 28. In order to facilitate  scheduling of clinic visits, a window of ± [ADDRESS_1040582] at Day 35 (±  2). 
End of Treatment (EOT) /Early Termination (ET) (Day  42 [±  2]) 
Subjects will have a clinic visit at Day  42 for a ssessments of efficacy and safety. Subjects who 
discontinue the study prior to this visit will undergo the procedures and assessments for this visit at the 
time of discontinuation.  
Follow-up Period (Day 49 [± 2]) 
All subjects who received at least one dose of study drug will have a follow -up visit for safety and 
tolerability assessments 7  (± 2) days after their last study drug dose. Assessment of potential withdrawal 
effects will also be made during the follow -up period. 
Efficacy, Safety, and PK/PD Assessments  
Efficacy will be evaluated using the MADRS, CGI -BP-S, and HAM-A. Treatment response and 
symptom remission will be assessed using the MADRS. Additional assessments will include evaluation 
of functional impairment associated with bipolar depressive symptoms using the SDS total score and 
symptom severity using the QIDS-SR16 total score. 
Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_31029], ECGs, vital 
signs, adverse event monitoring, cl inical laboratory tests, YMRS, and C -SSRS. Subjects who have 
significant findings for suicidal ideation upon completion of the C-SSRS at any time during the study 
must be referred to the investigator for follow -up evaluation. Assessment of potential withdrawal 
effects will be conducted via administration of the Physician’s Withdrawal Checklist. Movement 
disorders will be assessed by [CONTACT_143486], BARS, and Modified SAS.  A Data and Safety Monitoring Board

General Methodology 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the intention- to-treat (ITT) population, which includes 
all subjects who are randomized. The safety population includes all subjects who are randomized and 
receive at least 1  dose of study medica tion. In general, all analyses of the Japanese cohort are 
descriptive in nature and will be reported separately  unless otherwise specified .

Primary E fficacy Analysis: 
The primary efficacy estimand is defined as the efficacy of each  SEP- 4199 dose over placebo for 
6 weeks calculated as the difference in the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in the 
MADRS total score at Week  6) between each  SEP-[ADDRESS_1040586] be able to tolerate and adhere to treatment for 6 weeks. The analysis method 
makes a missing at random (MAR) assumption to the missing primary efficacy endpoints.  
A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) that includes terms for treatment, visit, region , 
baseline MADRS total score, and the treatment -by-visit interaction will be used for the primary efficacy 
analysis. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used for the within- subject correlation.  
The comparisons of SEP-4199 200 mg/day and SEP-4199 400 mg/day versus placebo at Week  6 will be 
adjusted for multiplicity using the  truncated Hochberg (γ) procedure  with truncation parameter, γ = 0.9  
(Dmitrenko  2017). 
To evaluate the robustness of the MMRM results for the primary efficacy endpoint with respect to the 
MAR assumption, sensitivity analyses based on a Missing Not At Random (MNAR ) assumption will be 
performed. 
A supplementary analysis of the primary efficacy of SEP -4199 will be conducted to explore the dose 
response relationship using the Multiple Comparison Procedure – Modelling (MCP -Mod) methodology. 
Possible dose response shapes to assess include linear, quadratic, Emax, and sigmoidal Emax. The best 
model fit will be selected using the minimum Akaike infor mation criterion  out of the statistically 
significant multiple contrast tests based on optimal contrast coefficients. Once the best model is selected, 
target dose(s) of interest including the minimum effective dose (MED) will be explored.  
Secondary Efficac y Analyse s: 
The CGI -BP-S score (depression)  will be analyzed by [CONTACT_759891].  
The CGI-BP-S secondary endpoint at Week  6 along with the primary endpoint at Week  6 will be tested 
using a mixture- based gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_759853] (FWER) . This 
gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_759854]. Once the primary objective of at least one primary endpoint is met using a truncated Hochberg (γ = 0.9), the second component, the 
CGI-BP-S hypotheses, will be tested using a regular Hochberg procedure. A hypothesis is testable in a 
latter family only if the hypothesis in the former f amily associated with the same dose level is rejected . 
Other Efficacy Analyses: 
The HAM -A and the QIDS -SR16 total score will be analyzed by [CONTACT_759892].  
The SDS and EuroQoL 5 dimensional questionnaire ( EQ-5D-5L) total scores will be analyzed using an 
ANCOVA model with treatment, region  as fixed effects, and appro priate baseline as a covariate.  
The MADRS tota l score responder proportions at Week [ADDRESS_1040587] for differences among the treatments for time to 
MADRS responder response. The analysis will be supplemented with Kaplan -Meier curves to illustrate 
the differences among the three treatments.

A cumulative distribution curve of treatment response fo r each treatment group will be presented . 
Remission incidence rates will be analyzed similarly to the MADRS responder analysis.  
The R- and S-amisulpride and plasma prolactin concentrations will be listed and summarized 
descriptively by [CONTACT_15994].  
The complete methodology and results of the population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
analyses will be reported separately.  
Safety A nalyses:  
AEs (or SAEs) and AEs leading to discontinuation will be summarized by [CONTACT_759893] . AEs will also be reported 
by [CONTACT_759894]. 
Mania incidence rates (YMRS)  will be analyzed similarly to the MADRS responder analysis (as 
described above). 
Descriptive statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_759895], laboratory parameters, vital signs, and ECG parameters. The incidence of subjects with elevated 
QTcF intervals : (> 450 for males and > 470 for females) and (> 500 msec for males or females)  and 
changes in QTc intervals ≥  30 msec, but < 60 msec and ≥ 60 msec will  be summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. 
Rank ANCOVA with adjustments for baseline value will be applied to change from baseline in serum 
prolactin, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], glucose, weight, and body mass index (BMI) for comparison between each SEP-4199 
group and placebo. 
Movement disorder measures (AIMS, BARS, and Modified SAS) will be analyzed using MMRM based 
on the change from baseline to Week  6. 
The frequency and severity of suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior in the C-SSRS will be provided for 
each time point as appropriate.  
Japanese Cohort Analyses:  
In general, descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the efficacy and safety of the Japanese 
cohort. An additional exploratory analysis with the Japanese cohort primary efficacy data will be 
performed by [CONTACT_759896] (US, EU) with region (US, EU, Japan) in the MMRM primary model. 
The Japanese cohort alone will also be analyzed using an MMRM method. 
In general, s afety analyses will be repeated for the Japanese Cohort using descriptive statistics. 
Sample Size:  
A total sample size of 279 evaluable subjects in US and Europe (93 per treatment group : SEP-4199 
200 mg/day, SEP -4199 400 mg/day, and placebo) with a 2-sided global alpha of 0.05 will provide about 
90% power to reject at least 1  truly significant comparison and about 75% power to reject both truly 
significant comparisons using the truncated Hochberg (γ = 0.9) procedure, assuming treatment effect 
sizes of 0.[ADDRESS_1040588] sizes were selected considering the data from the 
completed lurasidone bipolar depression study ( Loebel  2014). This effect size corresponds to a 
treatment difference of -3.[ADDRESS_1040589] adjustment of approximately 5% is used to 
compensate for information lost due to s ubjects who are randomized and do not provide any 
postbaseline primary efficacy data. The total sample size will be approximately 294 randomized 
subjects (or N  = 98  subjects per treatment group).

The sample size was calculated using the Mediana package version 1.05 within R  version  3.4.2  (R Core 
Team 2017). 
The sample size for the Japanese  Cohort (45  total  [N = 15 subjects per group] , including 9 dropouts) 
provides more than 80%  probability to have a treatment difference point estimate greater than zero  for 
the MADRS .

Confidential and Propr ietary  25 04 June 2018 4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background  
Bipolar spectrum illness (BD I, BD II, BD NOS) is estimated to affect 4.4% of the US 
population ( Merikangas  2007). Bipolar disorder causes more marked functional impairment 
(Shippee 2011) and has a greater impact on quality of life than unipolar depression 
(Gutierrez -Rojas  2008). Bipolar patients spend considerably more time in depressive than in 
manic states over the course of their illnesses ( Judd 2002, Judd 2003), and depressive symptoms 
therefore contribute more to impaired functioning, caregiver/family burden and economic costs 
than do manic/mixed symptoms ( Miller  2014).  
The treatment of bipolar depression is challenging, due to the complexity and heterogeneity of 
clinical presentati ons, which may involve mixed symptoms with depression predominating. 
Although the pharmacologic treatment of bipolar depression continues to be dominated by [CONTACT_759899], the anticonvulsants, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709], and serotonergic antide pressants, these treatments have significant limitations including tolerability and 
undesirable side effects such as metabolic derangement, weight gain, sedation/somnolence, sexual dysfunction, extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia ( Kemp  2014). In addition, treatment 
of bipolar depression with antidepressants remains controversial due to concerns about switching 
patients into hypomania, mania, or more rapid cycling ( APA 2002).  
Amisulpride is approved in Italy, Czech Republic, and Portugal for the treatment of dysthymia at 
a low dose of 50 mg/d ( Lecrubier  1997). In vitro radioligand binding studies show that racemic 
amisulpride has high affinity for serotonin 5-HT7 receptors in addition to dopamine D2 receptors (Abbas 2009). Preclinical pharmacology studies using [ADDRESS_1040605] that the 
antidepressant -like effects of amisulpride are mediated via 5 -HT7 receptor antagonism 
(Abbas 2009). 
Sunovion is developi[INVESTIGATOR_759856]-[ADDRESS_1040606] Rationale  
The current study is designed to evaluate SEP-4199 for the treatment of major depressive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_759845] I disorder. 
4.3. Risk-Benefit Assessme nt 
The clinical efficacy of amisulpride on depressive symptoms in mood disorders (Montgomery 2002) has been demonstrated at dose levels associated with relatively low 
D2 receptor occupancy. To improve the benefit/risk profile of amisulpride in mood disorders, 
SEP-4199 has been designed with a non- racemic ratio of enantiomers (85% R -amisulpride: 
15% S- amisulpride) designed to optimally target ≤ 50% D2 occupancy. In this way, SEP-[ADDRESS_1040607] activity of amisulpride while reducing the level of 
D2 antagonism to the minimum associated with antidepressant benefit, in order to limit 
D2-associated undesirable side effects. This pharmacologic profile is expected to confer 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  26 04 June 2018 significant antidepressant benefits in those patients with more severe forms of depression, such 
as depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_759857], and in patients with disorders

monotherapy given as 200 mg/day or 400 mg/day compared with placebo for the treatment of 
major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_759845] I disorder (bipolar I depression). The study is 
projected to randomize approximately 294 subjects (98 subjects per treatment group) in the US and Europe to one of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (SEP -4199 200 mg/day or 400 mg/day , 
or placebo).  
In addition, a Japanese cohort will be included in the study to summarize efficacy and safety data for Japanese subjects with bipolar I depression. Approximately 45 subjects (15 subjects per 
treatment group) will be randomized in the Japanese cohort in a 1:1:1 ratio (SEP-4199 
200 mg /day or 400 mg/day, or placebo). 
The study will consist of Screening (up to 21 days), 6 weeks of treatment  (42 days) , and 
follow-up (7 [±2] days after the last study drug dose) . A study schematic is presented in Figure  1. 
Details of the study assessments and other procedures to be performed at each visit are presented 
in Table 2 , Schedule of Assessments , and Section  11, Study Assessments. If necessary, subjects 
may return to the clinic at any time for an unscheduled visit.

Screening Period ( Day -22 to  -2) 
Informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any study procedures are performed 
for this study. Study eligibility criteria will be assessed during this period, and subjects will be washed out from prior or concomitant medications, where applicable, prior to randomization. 
Psychotropic medications (eg, antipsychotic agents, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers) are to 
be discontinued as tolerated and clinically appropriate at least 3  days prior to randomization. 

Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  30 04 June 2018 Per local clinical practice, subjects may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216328] 7  days during the Screening 
period. Further need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_759858] . 
Baseline (Day  -1) and Treatment Period (Day  1 through Day 42) 
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Screening will return to the study site on Day -1 for 
confirmation of screening evaluations as well as completion of predose assessments. Eligible 
subjects (based on confirmation of study entry criteria) will be randomized and dispensed study drug at Day  -1. 
Per local clinical practice, subjects may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216328] [ADDRESS_1040608] week of 
treatment with double -blind study drug. Further need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_759859] . 
Subjects will self -administer the study drug on an outpatient basis once daily with or without 
food beginning on Day 1 (the day after the Baseline visit) and continue for 6 weeks  (the last dose 
of study drug will be self -administered by [CONTACT_941] s ubject at home on the morning of Visit 6). 
Subjects will be instructed to administer study drug as a single oral dose in the morning at 
approximately the same time each day. Clinic visits are to begin  no later than 6 hours postdose , if 
possible. 
During the baseline (Day  -1) and treatment period  (Days  1 to 42), subjects will have clinic visits 
at Days  -1, 7, 14, and 28. In order to facilitate scheduling of clinic visits, a window of ±  [ADDRESS_1040609] at Day  35 (± 2).  
End of Treatment (EOT) /Early Termination (ET) (Day  42 [±  2]) 
Subjects will have a clinic visit at Day  42 for assessments of efficacy and safety. Subjects who 
discontinue the study prior to this visit will undergo the procedures and assessments for this visit 
at the time of discontinuation.  
Follow-up Period (Day 49  [± 2]) 
All subjects who received at least one dose of study drug will have a follow-up visit for safety and tolerability assessments 7  (± 2) days after their last study  drug dose. Assessment of potential 
withdrawal effects will also be made during the follow -up period.  
Efficacy, Safety, and PK/PD Assessments  
Efficacy will be evaluated using the MADRS, CGI -BP-S, and HAM-A. Treatment response and 
symptom remission will be  assessed using the MADRS. Additional assessments will include 
evaluation of functional impairment associated with bipolar depressive symptoms using the SDS total score and symptom severity using the QIDS-SR16 total score. 
Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_31029], ECGs, 
vital signs, adverse event monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, YMRS, and C- SSRS. Subjects 
who have significant findings for suicidal ideation upon completion of the C- SSRS at any time 
during the study must be referred to the investigator for follow-up evaluation. Assessment of potential withdrawal effects will be conducted via administration of the Physician’s Withdrawal 
Checklist. Movement disorders will be assessed by [CONTACT_143486], BARS, and SAS. 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.[ADDRESS_1040610] (DSMB) will review safety data at regular intervals during 
the study. 
Blood samples will be collected for population pharmacokinetics. Blood samples will be 
analyzed for plasma concentrations of R- and S-amisulpride and plasma prolactin. Prior to PK blood sample collection, subjects will record the date and time of their [ADDRESS_1040611]- recent study drug 
doses; the clinical site staff will record the dates and times of the 3  doses in the CRF ( Visits  4 
and 6 only) . Plasma samples collected for PK concentration analysis may also be used for the 
additional characterization and/or bioanalytical method development of putative metabolites of 
amisulpride and for other exploratory measurements, if needed. 
7.2. Treatment Assignment and Blinding 
7.2.1. Treatment Assignment  
After a subject provides consent, a unique subject number will be assigned  at screening , 
consisting of a 3-digit protocol number, 3-digit site number, and a unique 3- digit subject 
identifier (eg, the second screened subject from site #005 will be 201005002). Subjects will be 
numbered consecutively. No subject numbers are to be reused once assigned. This number will track a subject throughout their participation in the study.  
Subjects who passed study entry criteria and did not get randomized can be rescreened once to determine eligibility. Subjects who are rescreened must be assigned a new screening number . 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338]. The treatment schedule will be generated by a non -
study biostatistician. Once a subject is deeme d eligible to be randomized at Day  -1, an interactive 
voice/web -based  system (IXRS) will perform the treatment assignment. Subjects will be  
randomized to  1 of 3 treatments in a 1:1:1 ratio:  
• SEP-4199 200 mg/day  
• SEP-4199 400 mg/day  
• Placebo QD  
7.2.2. Blinding 
Subjects, Investigator s, clinical site  staff, persons performing the assessments, clinical operations 
personnel (including the sponsor’s bioanalytical manager) , data analysts, and personnel at central 
laboratories (including imaging) will remain blind ed to the identity of the treatment from the 
time of randomization until unblinding, using the following methods: 
• Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and 
will not be accessible by [CONTACT_109021]: bioanalytical lab oratory personnel involved in the analysis of PK 
samples , DSMB members involved in regular review of safety data, external 
statistical staff involved in preparing materials for DSMB reviews, and the Spo nsor’s 
clinical trials materials management. 
• Prolactin levels will be blinded except for results from Visit 1 (Screening).  
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  32 04 June 2018 • The identity of the treatments will be concealed by [CONTACT_759903], labeling, schedule of administration and appearance. 
• Study r esults , including unblinded data and randomization files, obtained in the US 
and Europe will not be published or disseminated to the Japan sites, Japan 
investigators or other personnel directly involved in the conduct of the study prior to 
the completion of the Japanese cohort. A fter unblinding of the US and Europe cohort, 
any personnel directly involved in the conduct of the US and Europe cohort will not 
be directly involved in the conduct of the Japanese cohort. 
Plasma concentrations of R-amisulpride, S-amisulpride, and total amisulpride  will not be 
disclosed  before unblinding of each cohort, respectively. In any case that concentration data 
transfer to the sponsor becomes necessary prior to the database lock, then th e concentration data 
can only be shared with sponsor’s bioanalytical project manager with dummy subject IDs. 
7.2.3. Emergency Unblinding Procedures  
In the case of a medical emergency, where knowledge of study drug by [CONTACT_759904], a [ADDRESS_1040612] therapeutic targets. The 
S-enantiomer is stereoselective for antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors. The R- enantiomer is 
stereoselective for antagonis m of serotonin 5- HT7 receptors.  
In PET imaging of healthy volunteers, D2 occupancies below 50% are achieved following single 
doses of the S-enantiomer below 100 mg. In polysomnography of healthy volunteers, 
serotonergic effects (REM suppression) are achieved following single doses of the R-e nantiomer 
at 340 mg and 600 mg.  
The ratio of 85:15 R:S- amisulpride (SEP -4199) is optimal for maximizing doses for serotonergic 
5-HT7 antagonism in a dose range which does not exceed 50% dopamine D2 occupancy. In PET imaging of healthy volunteers, D2 occupancies of 20-30% and 40- 50% are achieved 
following single  doses of 200 mg and 400 mg SEP -4199 (85:15), respectively. Thus, these fixed 
doses of SEP-4199 as a non -racemic 85:[ADDRESS_1040613] recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_759860] 
(≥ 4 epi[INVESTIGATOR_759861] < 8 epi[INVESTIGATOR_8731] 12 months) with or without 
psychotic features (diagnosed by [CONTACT_2681]- [ADDRESS_1040614]). The current 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_759862] I disorder will be confirmed by [CONTACT_759905].  
7.3.3. Rationale for the Endpoints

An IXRS will be used to manage subject screening and randomization, drug dispensation and 
accountability . The IXRS is an integrated web -based subject and drug management system.  
Study drug blister cards will be assigned by [CONTACT_759907]. The 
IXRS will generate instructions for which study medication unit/number to assign to a subject. Each subject will be dispensed one or two 9- day blister  card s per scheduled visit, depending on 
the timing of the next scheduled visit (see Table 2 ). 
The first study drug dose will be taken on Day 1. Subjects will be instructed to take their study drug as a single oral dose once a day  in the morning at approximately the same time  each da y. 
Study visits will begin no later than [ADDRESS_1040631] the date and time of each study drug administration  in the source (all visits) and CRF 
(Visits  4 and 6 only). 
Study drug should be maintained under the strict control of qualified site staff at all times. Appropriate guidelines should be followed in proper dispensation to the study participant. Prop er 
handling and storage should be followed. IXRS drug dispensing guidelines should be followed 
for dispensing study drug to the subject, in addition to all accountability records where required. 
Specific User Manuals will be supplied.  
9.5. Study Drug Accountability

returned to the Sponsor, unless other instructions are provided in writing by [CONTACT_2728]/CRO. 
Upon receipt of study drug, the Investigator or designee will inventory the supplies and verify 
receipt of supplies. The site will perform an acknowledgement of receipt via the IXRS, confirming the date of receipt, inventory and condition of study drug received. 
The IXRS  will be used for the accountability of the st udy drug at the clinical site. The 
Investigator or desig nee will maintain the inventory for accountability within the IXRS , 
including study drug dispensation, return and availability of study drug received. The 
Investigator or designee will collect and document all used and unused study drug from study 
subjects  at appropriate study visits. 
The drug will not be dispensed to any person who is not a study subject under this protocol. 
Study drug will not be dispensed to any subject following the completion of the 6- week  
treatment period.  
9.6. Study Drug Handling and Dis posal 
A drug inventory record will be supplied from Sponsor/CRO. The Investigator or designee on an ongoing basis must maintain a drug inventory record of supplied, received, dispensed, and 
returned medication. The Investigator or designee is required to return all unused study drug to the Sponsor or designee as instructed. The Investigator or designee is required to maintain copi[INVESTIGATOR_555676], drug accountability records, and records of return or final

morning at approximately the same time , beginning on Day 1 and continuing through Visit 6 
(Day  42 ± 2). 
10.2. Treatment Compliance  
Subjects will self-report  the date and time of their last [ADDRESS_1040633]. 
10.3. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_708495] a ll concomitant medication  administered between  Visit 1 and 
Visit 7 or at  discontinuation will be recorded  on the  CRF:  Medication  name, dose, frequency, 
route, start date, stop date, and indication. 
Information on the format and version of coding dictionary is provided in the Data Management 
Plan (DMP).  All medications will be coded using WHO- DD. 
Initiation of new psychotherapeutic interventions (e.g., a new course of psychotherapy) will not be permitted during the study. Subjects who have participated in ongoing psychotherapy treatment for at least [ADDRESS_1040634] include 
the dose, regimen, route, indication, and dates of use.  
10.3.1. Prior Medications  
Treatment with all pr ior psychotropic medications (eg, antipsychotic agents, antidepressants, and 
mood stabilizers) must be discontinued as tolerated and clinically appropriate at least 3  days or 
5 half -lives  (whichever is longer) prior to randomization. Treatment with sedative hypnotics (for 
insomnia) is permitted during the screening period, but should be tapered as clinically 
appropriate to conform with and adequately prepare the subject for the protocol-specified dosing 
limitations applicable to these agents following randomization (see Section  10.3.3). Subjects 
treated with fluoxetine, or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_759867] [ADDRESS_1040635] 2 1 days prior to randomization. All other psychotropic 
medication (except as described in this section), including medication and herbal supplements 
(eg, Gingko Biloba, Kava Kava, St. John’s Wort) must be discontinued as tolerated and clinically 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.[ADDRESS_1040636] been stable (±  25%) for at least 
30 days prior to screening. The concomitant medication dose may change as needed after 
randomization (or be discontinued). Routine vaccines (ie, seasonal influenza, pneumonia, etc.) 
are allowed based on Investigator judgement. β- adrenergic antagonists used to treat stable 
hypertension may be continued through the screening/washout phase and post- randomization. In 
addition, use of non-prescription pain medications (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], acetaminophen/paracetamol, ibuprof en) is allowed during all phases of the study provided these medications do not have a 
propensity for psychotropic effects and do not int erfere with the evaluation of study medication. 
Medications for short-term treatment of a medical condition (no more than 10 days) are allowed without consultation with the Medical Monitor provided that the medications do not consistently prolong the QTc i nterval (see Section  23, Appendix IV). 
10.3.3. Concomitant Psychotropic /Antipsychotic  Medications  
Treatment with benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (up to 6 mg/day) will be permitted as needed for movement 
disorders. In cases where benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_526104] a subject has had an inadequate response or intolerability to benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_99646], the following medications may be used to treat acute 
EPS: biperiden (up to 16 mg /day) or trihexyphenidyl (up to 15 mg/day) or diphenhydramine 
(up to 100 mg/day). Treatment with propranolol (up to 120 mg/day) or amantadine (up to 
300 mg/day) will be permitted as needed for akathisia. These allowed medications for the 
treatment of EPS, akathisia, and dystonia may be given in any formulation (oral, IM, or IV) as 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. Medications used to treat movement disorders should 
not be given prophylactically. Medications used for movement disorders should be tapere d and 
discontinued prior to randomization but may be r einstituted if symptoms emerge.  
In situations where anticholinergic agents or sedative/hypnotic agents (or any agents that may 
cause sedation) are administered, these should be taken at the same time ea ch day and should not 
be taken within [ADDRESS_1040637] the specified drugs available, similar drugs at equivalent dosages will be substituted as described in the Study 
Reference Manual or in consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
Concomitant use of sedative hypnotics is permitted during Screening and for Weeks 1-3 (through 
Visit 5) at the discretion of the Investigator with the following restrictions: Lorazepam is permitted at the discretion of the Investigator  up to 2 mg/day for intolerable anxiety/agitation, as 
clinically indicated. Lorazepam should be used sparingly, when clinically required, per investigator judgment. Lorazepam ( ≤ 2 mg/day ), eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123] (≤ 3 mg/day ), zopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123] 
≤ 7.5 mg/day ), zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] (≤  10 m g/day ), zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_216326] (≤ 12.5 mg/day) and temazepam 
(≤ 30 mg/day) may be administered at bedtime for insomnia, as needed. Hypnotic agents should 
be administered no more than once nightly and should not be used in combination. Continued use of the above sedat ive hypnotics beyond Visit 5 requires approval from the Medical Monitor. 
Anxiolytics, sedatives or hypnotics should not be administered within 8 hours prior to any psychiatric assessments.  
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  43 04 June 2018 In regions where lorazepam or zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_526106], another 
similar agent at equivalent doses will be permitted as specified by [CONTACT_67806]/or 
the Study Reference Manual. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_526107] a limited period of time 
with prior authorization from the Medical Monitor.  
Subjects who require treatment with one or more of the restricted medications should be 
excluded or discontinued (as appropriate) from the study. Since the list of medications in 
Section  23, Appendix IV is not comprehensive, the I nvestigator  should use medical judgment 
when a subject presents with a medication not on the list or consult with the Medical Monitor for 
clarification . 
10.3.4. Prohibited Medications  
Treatment with all psychotropic medications (eg, antipsychotic agents, antidepressants, and 
mood stabilizers) must be discontinued as tolerated and clinically appropriate at least [ADDRESS_1040638] 21 days prior to randomization. 
Treatment with sedative hypnotics (for insomnia) is permitted during the screening period, but 
should be tapered as clinically appropriate to ensure the subject meets and can comply with the 
protocol- specified dosing limitations applicable to these agents following randomization  (see 
Section  10.3.3). 
Medications that consistently prolong the QTc interval are prohibited during the study. For a list of these medications, please see Section  23, Appendix IV.  
The use of herbal supplements for any reason is prohibited during trial participation. The use of 
dietary supplements (eg, omega fatty acids) or other complementary or alternative medications 
for treating depression during the trial is not permitted . 
With the exception of benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], biperiden, trihexyphenidyl, and diphenhydramine (or their 
equivalent as agreed by [CONTACT_1689]) as specified in Section  10.3.3, medications used to 
treat movement disorders (including levodopa) are prohibited. 
10.4. Contraception Requirements  
Female Subjects  
1. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using and willing to continue using a 
highly effective form of birth control for at least [ADDRESS_1040639] dose of study drug, during the treatment period, and 2 months (60  days) after 
completion or premature discontinuation from the study drug. Highly effective forms of contraception include: 
• Combined estrogen and progestogen containing hormonal contraception (oral, 
intravaginal or transdermal) associated with inhibition of ovulation. 
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated 
with inhibition of ovulation. 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  44 04 June 2018 • Intrauterine device.  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Male sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence 
of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject. 
• True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Women using hormonal contraception must use an additional form of contraception (eg, condom 
with spermicide).  Because of the unacceptable failure rate of barrier (chemical and/or physical) 
methods, the barrier method of contraception must only be used in combination with a highly 
effective method. Post-coital methods of contraception are not permitted. The following is 
required: 
2. A female subject is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: 
a. Non-childbearing potential (ie, physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, 
including any female who is pre-menarchal or post-menopausal); 
− Postmenopausal females defined as being amenorrheic for greater than 2 years (or 
confirmed by [CONTACT_526143]) with an appropriate clinical profile. 
− Women who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] (as determined by [CONTACT_1130]’s medical history).  
− Women who have not been confirmed as postmenopausal and are not surgically sterile should be advised to use contraception as outlined above under number 1. 
b. Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at screening and agrees to 
satisfy one of the following requirements: 
− Complete abstinence from intercourse (as part of an abstinent lifestyle) a 
minimum of 2  months (60 days) prior to administration of the first dose of s tudy 
drug, throughout the Treatment Period, and for a minimum of 3  months (90 days) 
after completion or premature discontinuation from the study drug; or, 
− Established use of highly effective methods of contraception from [ADDRESS_1040640] dose of s tudy drug, during the Treatment Period, and  
2 months (60  days) after completion or premature discontinuation from the s tudy 
drug. Highly effective methods of birth control are listed above in number 1).  
Male Subjects  
Male subject with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must ensure that the ir partner(s) 
uses the methods of contraception as outlined for female subjects above. 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.[ADDRESS_1040641] self -report will be acceptable for listing all prior and concomitant medication use, 
demographics, medical history, psychiatric history, and evaluation for inclusion/exclusion except 
where specific protocol procedures are mandated to ensure appropriate enrollment (eg, certain 
baseline laboratory values). All medications taken within the [ADDRESS_1040642] circumference will be measured in inches or centimeters and recorded in the CRF.  
For medical history, only relevant/significant medical history and recurrence of any condition 
will be collected.  
11.2. Diagnostic Scales to Determine Study Eligibility  
11.2.1. SCID-5-CT 
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM- 5 (SCID -5) is the most widely used structured 
diagnostic instrument for assessing DSM-5 disorders. The SCID-5 is organized into diagnostic modules, and it assesses mood disorders, psychotic disorders, substance use disorders, anxiety 
disorders, obsessive–compulsive and related disorders, eating disorders, somatic symptom disorders, some sleep disorders (i.e., insomnia and hypersomnolence disorders), “externalizing 
disorders” (ie , intermittent explosive disorder, gambling disorder, and adult attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder), and trauma- and stressor-related disorders. The SCID -5-CT for clinical 
trials (SCID -CT; First 2015) will be utilized to confirm the diagnos is of bipolar I depression for 
this study.  
The SCID -5-CT will be administered by a qualified rater at the site. Further information 
regarding administration of the SCID -5-CT to determine study eligibility will be provided in the 
Study Reference Manual.  
11.2.2. Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)  
The YMRS will be administered at Screening and Baseline to determine subject eligibility. 
Subject s must have a YMRS total score ≤ 12 at both the Screening and Baseline visits.  
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  47 04 June 2018 The YMRS is an 11- item instrument used to assess  the severity of mania in patients with a 
diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The 11 items are: Elevated Mood, Increased Motor Activity 
Energy, Sexual Interest, Sleep, Irritability, Speech (Rate and Amount), Language-Thought 
Disorder, Content, Disruptive-Aggressive Behaviour, Appearance and Insight. The YMRS is a clinician -rated assessment. YMRS uses operationally  defined anchor points and the normal 
expected score is > 20. Ratings are based on patient self- reporting, combined with clinician 
observation (accorded greater score).  
The YMRS will be administered by a qualified rater at the site.  Further information regarding 
administration of the YMRS, including rater training and certification as well as recording YMRS scores to determine study eligibility will be p rovided in the Study Reference Manual.  
11.2.3. Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 
The MADRS will be administered at Screening and Baseline to determine subject eligibility. To 
be eligible for enrollment, subjects must have a MADRS total score ≥ [ADDRESS_1040643] a decrease (improvement) of ≥ 25% in MADRS total score from Screening to Baseline, or who have a MADRS total score < 22 at Baseline will not be eligible for study 
participation  (see Section 24, Appendix V). 
The MADRS is a clinician -rated assessment of the subject’s level of depression. The measure 
contains 10 items that measure apparent and reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep and 
appetite, difficulty concentrating, lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic and suicidal 
thoughts. Each item is scored in a range of 0 to 6 points, with higher scores indicating increased depressive symptoms. The Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA) will be used 
for the administration of the MADRS assessment.  
Further information regarding administration of the MADRS, including rater training and 
certification as well as recording MADRS scores will be provided in the Study Reference 
Manual.  
11.3. Efficacy Assessments  
11.3.1. Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 
In addition to administration of the MADRS at Screening and Baseline to determine subject 
eligibility, the MADRS will be administered at post- baseline visits as an efficacy assessment.  
The MADRS is a clinician -rated assessment of the subject’s level of depression. The measure 
contains 10 items that measure apparent and reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep and appetite, difficulty concentrating, lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic and suicidal

(CGI-BP-S - Depression)  
The CGI -BP-S is a clinician -rated assessment of the subject’s current illness state on a 7 -point 
scale, where a higher score is associated with greater illness severity. Following a clinical 
interview, the CGI- BP-S can be completed in 1-2 minutes.  
Further information regarding administration of the CGI- BP-S, including rater training and 
certification as well as recording CGI -BP-S scores will be provided in the Study Reference 
Manual.  
11.3.3. Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM -A) 
The HA M-A is a rating scale developed to quantify the severity of anxiety symptomatology. It 
consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms. Each item is rated on a 5 -point scale, 
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe/disabling). The Structured Interview Guide for the 
HAM -A (SIGH -A) will be used for t he administration of the HAM -A. 
Further information regarding administration of the HAM-A, including rater training and 
certification as well as recording HAM -A scores will be provided in the Study Reference 
Manual . 
11.3.4. Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  
The SDS is a composite of three items designed to measure the extent to which three major sectors in the patient’s life are impaired by [CONTACT_759909]. This anchored visual analog 
scale uses spatiovisual, numeric, and verbal descriptive anchors simultaneously to assess disability across three domains: work, social life, and family life. The patient rates the extent to 
which his or her 1) work, 2) social life or leisure activities, and 3) home life or fam ily 
responsibilities are impaired by [CONTACT_759910] 11-point visual analogue scale 
ranging from 0 to 10. There are verbal descriptors for the points on the scale as well as numerical 
scores that provide more precise levels of the verbal descriptors. The three items may be summed 
into a single dimensional measure of global functional impairment that ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). 
Further information regarding administration of the SDS, including rater training and 
certificatio n as well as recording SDS scores will be provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
11.3.5. Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self -Report 16-Item 
(QIDS-SR16) 
The QIDS -SR16 is a 16- item self -report measure of depressive symptomatology which uses a 
computerized assessment interface for administration. The scoring system for the QIDS-SR16 converts responses to 16 separate items into the nine DSM -IV symptom criterion domains. The 
total score ranges from 0 to 27. The nine domains comprise: sad mood; con centration; 
self-criticism; suicidal ideation; interest; energy/fatigue; sleep disturbance (initial, middle, and 
late insomnia or hypersomnia); decrease/increase in appetite/weight; and psychomotor agitation/retardation. Site staff will assist the subject in the initiation of the QIDS -SR16 
assessment, which will take place at the site. Clinical site staff will not participate in the administration of the QIDS -SR16 after initiation . 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199

be provided in the Study Reference Manual. 
11.3.6. EuroQoL 5- D (EQ-5D-5L) 
The E Q-5D- 5L is a standardized instrument developed by [CONTACT_759911] a measure of 
health -related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health condi tions and treatments. 
The EQ -5D- 5L consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. 
The descriptive system comprises five  dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, s light 
problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to 
indicate his/her health state by [CONTACT_368784]. This decision results in a 1- digit number that expresses the level selected for 
that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5- digit number that 
describes the patient’s health state.  
The EQ VAS records the patient’s self -rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the 
endpoints are labelled ‘The best health you can imagine’ and ‘The worst health you can imagine’. 
The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient’s own 
judgement. 
11.4. Safety Assessments  
The Investigato r or appropriate designee will review results of safety assessments as they 
become available.  The Sponsor must be kept fully informed of any clinically significant findings 
either at Screening or subsequently during study conduct through appropriate advers e event 
reporting and/or escalation to the Medical Monitor. 
11.4.1. Pretreatment Events and Adverse Events  
Pretreatment events will be recorded from the time informed consent is provided at screening 
until the time of first dose administration at Day 1. 
Adverse events will be collected for each subject. Subjects should be queried in a non- leading 
manner, without specific prompting (eg, “Has there been any change in your health status since your last visit?”). See Section  12, Safety Reporting. 
AEs and SAEs will be monitored throughout the study at all visits. 
11.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The clinical laboratory tests required by [CONTACT_29960]  21, Appendix II .

11.4.4. Centrally -read ECG  
All ECGs will be obtained in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], after the subject has been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_290601] 5  minutes. ECGs will be 12- lead with a 10 -second rhythm strip. ECGs should be obtained 
prior to drawing blood samples, with the exception of fasting blood draws . All attempts should 
be made to use the same ECG recorder for all visits within individual subjects. ECGs will be centrally read at a core lab according to established quality assurance procedures for inter/intra reader variability. Refer to Section  20, Appendix I f or additional information . 
To determine subject eligibility, Screening ECG may only be repeated due to technical issues . 
11.4.5. Safety Scales  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) 
The C -SSRS is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs (suicidal behavior 
and suicidal ideation) throughout the study. The strength of this suicide classification system is 
in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over -identification of 
suicidal behavior. The C- SSRS will be administered by a trained rater at the site.  
This study will utilize 2  versions of the C- SSRS. At the screening visit, the baseline/screening 
version will be completed; for all subsequent visits, the “Since Last Visit” versio n of the C- SSRS 
will be administered.  
Subjects who answer “yes” to “suicidal ideation” item  4 (active suicidal ideation with some 
intent to act, without specific plan) or item 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent) on the C- SSRS assessment at Screening (in the past month) are not eligible and  must be 
referred to the Investigator for follow- up evaluation.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS) 
The AIMS is a clinician -rated assessment of abnormal movements consisting of unobtrusive 
observation of the subject at rest (with shoes removed) and several questions or instructions directed toward the subject. Using a severity scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe), clinicians 
rate dyskinesia in several body regions, including the facial area, extremities, and trunk. There 
are two  items related to dental status, as well as three  global impression  items assessing overall 
severity, incapacitation, and the subject’s awareness of abnormal movements ( Guy 1976, 
Munetz 1988). The AIMS raters will be required to meet specific credential and educational criteria before they are ce rtified to rate for this s tudy.  
Further information regarding administration of the AIMS, including rater training and

completion of efficacy and safety assessments and procedures scheduled for this visit are 
completed). The PWC will be administered again at the Follow -up visit ( Day 49 ± 2). 
The PWC is used to evaluate symptoms of withdrawal after discontinuation of study medication. 
Symptoms are assessed as present or absent and if present then intensity is assessed as mild, 
moderate, or severe.  
11.5. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
A validated enantioselective liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) 
method will be  used for determination of plasma R- and S-amisulpride concentrations, and an 
enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be used for determination of plasma prolactin 
concentrations. 
Plasma concentrations of R -amisulpride, S-amisulpride, and prolactin will be assayed using 
plasma  samples from blood collected according to the schedule of assessments (see Section  22, 
Appendix III for sample collection and handling guidelines). Blood collection date and times 
must be recorded.  
Remaining plasma  samples after amisulpride  PK and prolactin analysis may also be used for the 
additional characterization and/or bioanalytical method development of putative metabolites of 
amisulpride and for other exploratory measurements, if needed . 
Population PK analysis methods will be used to characterize the PK/PD profiles in s ubjects 
treated with SEP -4199. Results of population PK analysis will be described in a separate report

Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.[ADDRESS_1040653] medical occurrences that occur between the time of signing the informed consent form 
(ICF) and drug administration are pre- treatment events. Those that occur after administration of 
study drug are considered AEs. Pre -treatment hospi[INVESTIGATOR_759871] t occur in accordance with  local 
clinical practice during the screening period (for wash -out from prior or concomitant 
medications) will not be considered as SAEs and do not need to be reported as such. Any 
untoward event that may occur during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_526124] a pretreatment  
event. If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_526125], the event must be reported as an SAE.  
An AE can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal or 
clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration 
of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. AEs may in clude the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of 
pre-existing conditions. 
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be docume nted as the AE 
and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is pretreatment event or an AE that meets one or more of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life -threatening.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require a 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction)  (see Section  12.3); the event itself, however, may be of 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  62 04 June 2018 relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning as defined by [CONTACT_29967].  
During the study, if a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (eg, elective surgery) that was 
scheduled before the study entry, ie, before informed consent for an event/condition t hat 
occurred before the study, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29919] a therapeutic intervention and not the 
result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be reported as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
SAE criteria information will be captured on the CRF. 
12.2. Objective Findings 
Clinically significant abnormal objective findings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG value, and physical examination observation) will also be recorded as  AEs.  
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be 
recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (eg, viral hepatitis will be recorded as 
the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then the sign 
(eg, clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or symptom (eg, abdominal pain) will 
be recorded as the AE.  
The Investigator listed on the Form FDA  1572 (MD or DO) (or Sub -Investigator MD or DO as 
described on the delegation log) will review ECG and l aboratory reports and initial and date  on 
all pages, or other acceptable documentation process approved by [CONTACT_1034]. Laboratory test 
and ECG results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_713536]. The Investigator 
must determine the clinical significance of all out-of- range lab values (except drug screens) and 
abnormal ECG results. Possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of uncertain 
causality must be repeated. Any abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. Any value outside the normal range will be flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate designee at the study center . The Investigator or appropriate designee 
will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical significance. If the result of any test (or repeat 
test, if done) from the samples taken during Screening is indicated as clinically significant and is not covered by [CONTACT_725983]  8.1, the subject will not be allowed into the study. 
Additional testing during the study may be done if medically indicated. If a clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples taken after dosing, during the study, and/or at the Follow- Up 
Visit, this should be recorded as an AE and the subject will be followed until the test(s) has 
(have) normalized or stabilized. 
If a subject experiences symptoms or ECG findings suggestive of an arrhythmia during the 
study, the subject should be evaluated by a cardiac specialist. If such an arrhythmia is detected 
during the study and is thought to be immediately life -threatening (eg , torsades de pointes 
[TdP]), the subject is to be treated immediately following the site’s standard emergency 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.[ADDRESS_1040654] a > 60 ms increase in QTcF from baseline will be discontinued from the study drug and 
followed until the event resolves; in addition, an adverse event will be reported.  
Subjects who develop adverse events of am enorrhea, gynecomastia, or galacto rrhea are to be 
discontinued from the study drug . 
12.3. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
All pre -treatment events and AEs must be recorded in the subject’s study records/source 
documents in accordance with the Investiga tor’s normal clinical practice.  
All pre -treatment events and AEs must be recorded on the CRF. 
Pre-treatment events will be recorded from the time informed consent is provided at screening 
until just prior to first study drug dose administration at Day  1. AEs will be recorded beginning 
after first study drug dose administration at Day  [ADDRESS_1040655] to follow-up. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , frequency , seriousness,  action taken with the 
study drug, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy drug. Definitions for severity , 
frequency , action taken with the study drug, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy drug 
are presented below.  
The severity  of AE:  
• Mild  - Ordinarily transient symptoms that do not influence performance of subject’s 
daily activities. Other t reatment is not ordinarily indicated. 
• Moderate - Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Moderate influence on performance of subject’s daily activities. Other t reatment may 
be necessary.  
• Severe - Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’s daily activities. May be unable to continue the s tudy, and othe r treatment may be 
necessary.  
The frequency  of AE : 
• Once – an isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
• Intermittent  – occurs on two or more separate occasions.  
• Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution. 
The action taken  with the s tudy drug: 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  64 04 June 2018 • Dose Not Changed  
• Drug Withdrawn – Study drug stopped permanently . 
• Not Applicable  
• Unknown  
The outcome of the AE: 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
• Fatal 
• Unknown  
The causal relationship of the AE to th e study drug: 
• Not related  
o Not related  - Improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to 
other drugs or underlying disease. 
• Related  
o Possible  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, but 
could be related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease. 
o Probable  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is 
unlikely to be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there 
is a plausible mechanism to implicate the study drug. 
o Definite  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_29969]. The AE should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not mandatory 
before assigning a definite causality.  
The Medical  Advisor is the initial contact [CONTACT_29970]. The contact [CONTACT_759913] [ADDRESS_1040656] be immediately reported to  the Sponsor: 
• SAE  
• Pregnancy  
Emergency contact [CONTACT_29972] [ADDRESS_1040657] participation in the s tudy, the Investigator or an authorized delegate 
should report SAEs “spontaneously” to the Sponsor [COMPANY_003] Pharmacovigilance (PVG) if 
considered at least possibly related to the s tudy drug. 
SAEs will be followed until resolution, loss to follow-up, stabilization of condition, or the event 
is otherwise explained.  
In addition to the initial telephone notification, a n initial SAE form as applicable must be 
completed and signed and sent via fax or email (see Table 1 ) to the Sponsor [COMPANY_003] -PVG within 
[ADDRESS_1040658] (IRB) or Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) by [CONTACT_079]  [INVESTIGATOR_526126]/IEC guidelines. 
The appropriate PVG group must be contact[CONTACT_759914]. 
The immediate report should be made by [CONTACT_13658] a very short period of time and under no circumstances should this exceed 24 hours following knowledge of the SAE or 
pregnancy. 
Sunovion will review all SAE reports to determine if an y SAEs are suspected unexpected seri ous 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs).  
All fatal or life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be reported as soon as possible, but no later than 
[ADDRESS_1040659] becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she will be instructed to return 
promptly/within [ADDRESS_1040660] notification of pregnancy to the study center and undergo a 
serum/urine pregnancy test, as confirmation of pregnancy. Every effort will be made to follow-up all pregnancies, including those in the female partner of male subjects, until resolution 
(ie, termination [voluntary or spontaneous] or birth), providing the volunteers consent to 
follow-up. 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.[ADDRESS_1040661] (DSMB) will review safety data at regular intervals. The DSMB will be independent of the Sponsor, CRO, and the Investigators and will be empowered to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_29921], but not for efficacy or futility. The 
DSMB may review blinded, unblinded, or partially unblinded data, but the Sponsor ( with the 
exception of the relevant members of the pharmacovigilance team responsible for reporting 
Suspected Unexpe cted Serious Adverse Reactions [S[LOCATION_003]Rs] ), the CRO, and the Investigators 
will remain blinded until the official unblinding of the database.  The membership of the DSMB 
and its mandate will be described in a separate DSMB charter.  
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.[ADDRESS_1040662] FROM STUDY/ 
DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY DRUG  
13.1. Criteria for Subject Termination  
Subject s may terminate the study participation  at any time for any reason.  
The possible reasons for the termination of study participation  are as follows : 
• Adverse event.  
• Lack of efficacy (specify).  
• Lost to follow- up (specify).  
• Pregnancy.  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] (specify).  
• Non-compliance with study drug (specify) . 
• Protocol deviation (specify) . 
• Death  
• Other (specify).  
If at any time during the course of the study, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject may 
no longer safely participate due to a change in medical status (eg, experiences an AE, becomes 
pregnant), the subject must be discontinued from the study drug. 
Subjects who, at any study visit post- baseline have a QTcF value greater than [ADDRESS_1040663] 
a > 60 ms increase in QTcF from baseline, or who experience a life-threatening arrhythmia  will 
be discontinued from the study drug and followed until the event resolves; in addition, an 
adverse event  will be reported.  
Subjects who develop adverse events of amenorrhea, gynecomastia, or galactorrhea are to be discontinued from the study drug . The reason for discontinuation and information on the epoch 
will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. In case of  death, the date of death should be captured 
on the CRF. 
Subjects who prematurely terminate the s tudy participation will not be replaced.  
Subjects who discontinue prior to Visit 6 ( Day 42 [± 2]) will undergo procedures and 
assessments scheduled for Visit  6 (Day  42 [±  2]) at the time of early discontinuation (see 
Section  11.6.3).  
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  68 04 June 2018 14. STUDY TERMINATION  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at this study center or at multiple centers 
for safety or administrative reasons at any time  while safeguarding that early termination does 
not compromise subjects’ safety or well- being . In particular, a study center that does not recruit 
at an acceptable rate may be closed . Should the study be terminated and/or the study center 
closed for whatever reason, all documentation and s tudy medication s pertaining to the s tudy 
must be returned to the Sponsor or its representat ive. 
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], clinical observations suggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate part or the entire study after consultation with the Sponsor. 
In the event of s tudy or site termination, subjects will b e required to return for a final study 
assessment [ADDRESS_1040664] dose of study drug (ie, follow -up) and be provide d with access 
to standard care.  
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  69 04 June 2018 15. STATISTICS  
The comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide details on the statistical methods 
planned for this study and will be finalized prior to the US and Europe cohort unblinding. 
15.1. Sample Size  
A total sample size of 279 evaluable subjects in US and Europe (93 per treatment group: 
SEP-4199 200 mg/day, S EP-4199 400 mg/day, and placebo) with a global  2-sided alpha of 0.05 
will provide about 90% power to reject at least 1  truly significant comparison and about 
75% power to reject both truly significant comparisons using the truncated Hochberg (γ = 0.9) 
procedure, assuming treatment effect sizes of 0.[ADDRESS_1040665] sizes 
were selected considering the data from the completed lurasidone bipolar depression study 
(Loebel  2014). This effect size corresponds to a treatment difference of -3.[ADDRESS_1040666] adjustment of approximately 5% is used to compensate for information lost 
due to subjects who are randomized and do not provide any postbaseline primary efficacy data. 
The total sample size will be approximately 294  randomized subjects (or N = 98 subjects per 
treatment group).  
For the secondary efficacy endpoint, assuming the [ADDRESS_1040667] 71% power to reject at least one truly significant comparison within the CGI -BP-S family 
using the regular Hochberg procedure, given a treatment difference of -0.[ADDRESS_1040668] deviation of 1.24 on the CGI- BP-S change from baseline at Week  6. 
The correlation between the primary and the secondary endpoint is assumed to be 0.8 for each 
treatment arm . 
The sample size was calculated using the Mediana package version 1.05 within R version 3.4.2 
(R Core Team  2017). 
The sample size for the Japanese cohort (45 total [N  = 15 subjects per group], including 
9 dropouts) provides more than 80% probability to have a treatment difference point estimate 
greater than zero  for the MADRS . 
15.2. Analysis Populations  
Each population below will be created for both the US and Europe cohort and the Japanese 
cohort. 
Intention -to-Treat Population : The intention -to-treat ( ITT) population will consist of subjects  
who are randomized . Subjects  are included in the ITT population regardless of any protocol 
deviations. Subjects  will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group. The ITT 
population is the primary population for all efficacy analyses. 
Per Protocol Population : These are all ITT subjects who have no important protocol deviations 
that may affect the interpretation of the primary efficacy endpoint as defined in Section  15.3.3. 
Subjects in the Per Protocol population will be analyzed according to their randomized 
treatment  group. 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  70 04 June 2018 Analysis of the primary and the secondary efficacy endpoints will also be performed using the 
Per Protocol population. 
Safety Population : The safety population will consist of all subjects who randomized and 
receive at least one dose of study medication. Subjects will be analyzed according to the 
predominant treatment received . The predominant treatment is defined as the treatment to which 
the subject is exposed for the greatest duration during the treatment period. This will generally be 
the same as the randomized treatment group, unless the subject takes  incorrect study medicat ion 
during the ir entire participation in the study.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK ) Population:  The PK population includes the Safety population subjects 
who have at least [ADDRESS_1040669] PK . The PK analysis will be based on the PK population. 
15.3. Data Analysis 
In general, all analyses of the Japanese cohort are descriptive in nature and will be reported separately from the US and Europe cohort, unless otherwise specified . 
Descripti ve summaries will be provided where appropriate for each of the endpoints. In general, 
summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_759915] a population.  
In general, continuous outcomes will be summarized for the number of subjects, mean, 95% CI for the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, Q1, Q3, minimum and maximum. For categorical 
outcomes, the number and percentage of subjects will be presented. 
All statistical inference analyses will be performed with [ADDRESS_1040670] data listings. Unscheduled measurements will be included in the listings and will not be included in summary tabl es, unless specified otherwise. 
SAS® software Version  9.[ADDRESS_1040671] date will be used. 
Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_560225] , both continuously (mean percentage) and 
categorically (compliant vs. non-compliant, non- compliant <  75% and non- compliant > 125%, 
and subjects with any missing compliance). Treatment compliance will also be presented in a 
data listing.  
Exposure duration will be calculated using the number of days from the first dose through the last dose of study medication, inclusive. Exposure will be summarized both continuously overall and categorically (≥ 4 days, ≥ 7 days, ≥ 14 days, etc.) by [CONTACT_759916]. 
15.3.3. Important Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) will be identified and documented based on a review of potentially IPDs. The potentially IPDs will be identified through programmatic checks of s tudy

15.3.5. Efficacy Analyses 
In general, all efficacy analyses of the Japanese cohort are descriptive in nature, any additional 
analysis detai ls will be provided in the SAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in t he MADRS total score at Week  6. 
The primary efficacy estimand is defined as the efficacy of each SEP -[ADDRESS_1040673] be able to tolerate 
and adhere to treatment for 6 weeks.  
The efficacy of SEP -4199 in terms of the MADRS total score will be evaluated using the 
following two null hypotheses: 
H1: There is no difference in mean change from baseline at Week  6 on the MADRS total 
score in the SEP -4199 200 mg treatment arm compared to Placebo . 
H2: There is no difference in mean change from baseline at Week  [ADDRESS_1040674], one of the primary comparisons demonstrate a significant  result , the 
study will be considered positive. 
The primary ef ficacy endpoint will be analyzed for the ITT population by [CONTACT_759920], with change from baseline in the MADRS total score as the response variable and with 
factors for treatment group, visit, region, baseline MADRS total score, and the treat ment -by-visit 
interaction. This analysis method makes a missing at random (MAR) assumption to the missing primary efficacy endpoints. The Kenward Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. An unstructured covariance matrix  will be used for the 
within -subject correlation. A robust sandwich estimator for the standard error of the fixed effects 
(Diggle  2002) along with a spatial exponential or a spatial power covariance structures will be 
assumed sequentially in case of a convergence problem.  The first covariance structure to yield 
convergence will be used in the analysis.  
The Least Square ( LS) mean treatment differences (each SEP -4199 group minus placebo) of 
change from baseline at Week 6, their 2 -sided 95% CIs, and the associated p -values will be 
calculated based on the MMRM . 
Multiplicity adjustment to control the global family wise Type  I error rate at 5% is described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The normality assumption underlying the primary MMRM model will be assessed graphically. Details will be provided in the SAP. 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  73 04 June 2018 An additional exploratory analysis with the Japanese cohort primary efficacy data will be 
performed by [CONTACT_759921]  (US, EU) with region (US, EU, and Japan) in  the primary 
MMRM model. The Japanese cohort alone will also be analyzed using an MMRM method. Details will be provided in the SAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Sensitivity Analyses 
To address early dropouts under the assumption of missing not at random (MNAR), a 
pattern -mixture model (PMM) using a placebo-based multiple imputation method and a pattern 
mixture model using multiple imputations with penalties (ie, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_759872]) will be performed as sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the MMRM results for the primary analysis 
based on the ITT population. 
MADRS total score  change from baseline values over time for dropouts and for completers will 
be plotted by [CONTACT_759922]. Subjects will be grouped by [CONTACT_759923]. This will resul t in five  categories of subject discontinuation: 
Week  1 dropouts, Week 2 dropouts, Week 4 dropouts, Week 6 dropouts and Completers. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Supportive Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the ITT population as supportive analysis. The model will include terms for treatment, region  
and baseline MADRS total score as covariate. The LS mean of treatment differences (each SEP-4199 group minus placebo), their 2 -sided 95% CIs, and the associated p- values will be 
obtained from the model. 
The primary MMRM analysis will be repeated for the PP population to examine the impact of 
protocol deviations. 
A supplementary analysis of the primary efficacy of SEP -4199 will be conducted to explore the 
dose response relationship using the Multiple Comparison Procedure – Modelling (MCP-Mod) 
methodology. Possible dose response shapes to assess include linear, quadratic, Emax, and sigmoidal Emax. The best model fit will be selected using the minimum Akaike information 
criterion out of the statistically significant multiple contrast tests based on optimal contrast coefficients. Once the best model is selected, target dose(s) of interest including the mini mum 
effective dose will be explored. 
Details will be provided in the SAP for any additional supportive analyses. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses 
The secondary efficacy endpoint, t he CGI -BP-S score, will be analyzed by [CONTACT_759924].  
The secondary endpoint will be tested once at least one primary endpoint is deemed significant 
using a mixture -based gate -keepi[INVESTIGATOR_759873]  I error rate. 
The details are described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  74 04 June 2018 The MMRM analysis will be repeated using the PP population for the secondary endpoints. Both 
endpoints will also be analyzed using an ANCO VA model with treatment, region  as fixed effects 
and appropriate baseline as a covariate for the ITT population. 
Sensitivity analyses similar to the primary endpoint will be repeated for the secondary efficacy 
endpoint. Details will be provided in the SAP. 
Details will be provided in the SAP for the secondary efficacy endpoint analyses and any 
additional supportive analyses. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Efficacy Endpoint Analyses 
All other efficacy endpoints will be performed using the ITT population. 
The HAM -A and the QIDS -SR16 total score s will be analyzed by [CONTACT_759925].  
The HAM -A, the QIDS -SR16, the SDS, and the EQ-5D- 5L total score s will be analyzed using 
an ANCOVA model with treatment, region  as fixed effects, and appropriate baseline as a 
covariate. 
A MADRS total score responder is defined as achieving a ≥  50% reduction from the baseline 
total score. The MADRS total score responder  proportions at Week [ADDRESS_1040675]. The analysis will be supplemented with Kaplan -Meier curves to illustrate the differences among  the three treatments.  
A cumulative distribution curve for all treatment groups will be presented, plotting the 
cumulative percent of MADRS responders versus the change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week  6. 
Remission incidence rates will be analyzed similarly to the MADRS responder analysis.  
Details will be provided in the SAP for the other efficacy endpoint analyses and any addi tional 
supportive analyses. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adjustment for Multiplicity  
A mixture -based gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_759874] (γ = 0.9) will be used to 
control the global FWER at 5% for the primary (E1) and secondary endpoint (E2) 
(Dmitrenko  2017). Using this method, a hypothesis is testable in a latter family only if the 
hypothesis in the former family associated with the same dose level is rejected.  
The hypotheses associated with the primary and the secondary endpoint will be grouped into 
2 hierarchical families as seen in  Figure  2. 
• Family F1: SEP-4199 200 mg /day versus placebo (H
1), and SEP -4199 400 mg /day 
versus placebo (H 2), based on change from baseline in MADRS total score at 
Week  6 (E1)

The mixture -based gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_759875] 2 steps:  
• Step 1: The SEP-4199 vs placebo comparisons for E1 (hypotheses H 1 and H 2) will be 
performed using a truncated Hochberg (γ = 0.9) test . 
• Step 2: The SEP-4199 vs placebo comparisons for E2 (hypotheses H 3 and H 4) will be  
performed using a regular Hochberg test only when the corresponding comparisons 
from Step  1 are rejected . For example, H 4 is tested only if H2 is rejected.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be repe ated for the PP population to provide additional 
information on the robustness of the primary efficacy results. The Hochberg procedure will not 
be used for the PP population. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy Subgroup Analys es

protocol number, and include the date that approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_11744]. The letter 
must also contain a statement that the IRB /IEC complies with the requirements in 
21 CFR  Part 56 for a s tudy conducted under a US IND or ICH GCP, as applicable.  
The Investigator/CRO is responsible for obtaining from the IRB/IEC continued review of the clinical research or submitting per iodic progress reports, in accordance with applicable 
regulations, at intervals not to exceed one year and (if applicable) as otherwise additionally 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.00  SEP-4199 
Confidential and Propr ietary  85 04 June 2018 specified by [CONTACT_1201]/ IEC. The Sponsor must be supplied with written documentation of 
continued review of the clinical research.  
The Investigator must promptly inform their IRB/IEC  of all SAEs reported by [CONTACT_526163]/CRO in accordance with 
applicable law (s) and regulation(s). 
17.3. Informed Consent  
The Investigator will prepare the informed consent form and provide the form to Sponsor/CRO 
for approval prior to  submission to the IRB/IEC. 
The informed consent form will be approved by [CONTACT_1034]/CRO prior to submission to the 
IRB/IEC. The Sponsor/CRO may provide a template informed consent form to be qualified by 
[CONTACT_29988]. All informed consent forms must contain 
the minimum elements as mandated by [CONTACT_759936], applicable local law(s) and regulations and 
will be  subject to Sponsor /CRO  approval as well as IRB /IEC approval. The Sponsor /CRO  may 
submit informed consent forms to a central IRB/IEC for review and approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_526127]. 
Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective subject will be given a full explanation of 
the study, allowed to read the approved informed consent form and be provided ample time and 
the opportunity to ask any questions that may arise. Once all questions have been answered and 
the Investigator is assured that the prospective subject understands the implications of 
participating in the study, the prospective subject will be asked to give consent to participate in 
the study by [CONTACT_1725]. As part of the consent process, each prospective 
subject must consent to direct access to hi s/her medical records for study-related monitoring, 
auditing, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection. It should be clearly explained to each 
prospective subject that participation in each and every clinical visit and assessment is expected.  
The subject may be discontinued from study medication, but that does not necessarily negate the 
expectation that the subject will continue to participate in the study through the final visit/assessment.  The Investigator will provide a copy of the signed informed consent form to 
each subject , and will record the date of the informed consent on the CRF. 
If an amendment to the protocol changes the subject participation schedule in scope or activity, or if important new information becomes available that may be relevant to  the subject’s consent, 
the informed consent form must be revised, submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The revised informed consent form must be used to obtain consent from a subject currently enrolled in the study if he or she is affected by [CONTACT_29991]. The revised 
informed consent form must be used to obtain consent from any new subjects who are enrolled 
into the study after the date of the approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_29928].  
17.4. Subject Privacy 
The Sponsor (or Sponsor representative) or any designees affirm uphold the subjects 
confidentiality.  The subject will be identified by [CONTACT_19494]; full names will be masked 
prior to transmission to the Sponsor. The confidentiality of the subject’s personal data shall be protected in accordance with appropriate laws and regulations. 
Protocol SEP380-201, Version 2.[ADDRESS_1040686]’s confidentiality has been breached, this must be 
rectified immediately. All subject identifiable information should be remo ved and the 
Sponsor notified. 
17.5. Protocol Amendments and Emergency Deviations 
All revisions and/or amendments to this protocol must be approved in writing by [CONTACT_132580]/IEC. The Investigator will not make any changes to the conduct of the 
study or the protocol without first obtaining written approval from the Sponsor and the IRB/IEC, 
except where necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a study subject.  
Emergency deviations or modifications may be initiated without Sponso r or IRB/IEC approval or 
favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], only in cases where the deviation or modification is necessary to eliminate or avoid an immediate apparent hazard to subjects. Emergency deviations or modifications must be reported to the Sponsor/CRO and the IRB/IEC  immediately/within five business days of the 
occurrence, or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
17.6. Records Retention  
The Investigator /the study center must arrange for retention of s tudy records at the study center  
for at least 15  years (or at least 25  years in the EU) from time of participation in the study or 
longer in accordance with applicable regulations and Sponsor SOPs. The Investigator /site should 
take measures to  prevent accidental or premature destruction of these document s. Documents 
cannot be destroyed without written Sponsor authorization. The Sponsor will inform the Investigator/ the study center  when the destruction of documents is permitted.  
17.7. Inspection of Records  
In the event of an inspection, the Investigator agrees to allow representatives of the Sponsor and  
its representative and , the regulatory authorities’ access to all study records . The Investigator will 
promptly notify the Sponsor /CRO of all requests to inspect a Sunovion-/ DSP-sponsored study by 
[CONTACT_29993] a copy of all such inspection reports. 
17.8. Financial Disclosure  
By [CONTACT_12570], the Investigator agrees to provide to the Sponsor prior to start of study accurate financial information to allow the Spons or to submit complete and accurate certification 
and disclosure statements as required by [CONTACT_29994] (21 CFR  Part 54). The

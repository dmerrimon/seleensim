Clinical phase Phase IIb
Trial rationale Current treatment options for controlling acute flare of GPP, complete 
resolution of sy mptoms and prevention of reoccurrence of flares are 
limited and often do not provide sustained efficacy . Moreover, current 
therapeutic options are not suitable for life- long treatment due to their 
side effect profile and exist ing contraindications. The motivation of 
this study  is toprovide dose -ranging data for 3 dose regimens of BI 
655130 compared to placebo and to evaluate efficacy , safet y, and 
tolerability  of BI 655130 at preventing GPP flares compared to 
placebo in patient s with a history  of GPP and currently  (at screening 
and at randomization) presenting with a Generalized Pustular 
Psoriasis Physician Global Assessment ( GPPGA )score of 0 or 1 
(clear or almost clear).
Trial objective(s) The primary  objective of the trial is to demonstrate a non -flat dose 
response curve and evaluate the dose -response relationship for 3
subcutaneous dos ingregimens of BI 655130 (with each regimen 
consisting of a single loading dose and a separa te maintenance 
subcutaneous dosing regimen) versus placebo , on the primary  
endpoint, the time to the first GPP flare onset up to week 48
.
The secondary  objective is to demonstrate superiority  versus placebo 
for each of BI 655130 high dose ( 300mg q4w )and BI 655130 
medium dose (300 mg q12w ) on th e primary  endpoint, the time to the 
first GPP flare onset up to week 48, as well as the key  secondary  
endpoint, the occurrence of a t least one GPP flare up to week 48 .
Another objective isto evaluate safet y and tolerability  of multiple s.c.

predose (prior to blood sampling ),10 mins after the end of drug administration and at Visit 2 and Visit 3 additional measurements will be performed approximately 60 minutes after the 
end of  drug administration (i.e. [ADDRESS_756786] injection). Refer to Section 5.2.2 .
5Only applicable for women of childbearing potential. S – serum pregnancy test (performed at screening). U –urine pregnancy tests will be performed at all other visits indicated. Urine
pregnancy testing should be done prior to study drug ad ministration. Study drug should only be administered in case of a negative test result. In case of a positive urine pregnancy test, a 
serum pregnancy (S) test will be done (via central lab) and study drug administration will be postponed until negative res ult of serum pregnancy test is available .
6ECG measurements should always precede blood sampling and drug administration.

8Safety laboratory tests include cl inical chemistry, haematology, coagulation, and urinalysis, and will be performed centrally. See Section 5.2.3 and Table 5.2.3: 1 .
9Photographs of skin/skin lesions are to precede skin biopsies and study drug administration.
10Collection of serum biobanking sample is optional. Participating patients are required to give informed consent specifically for biobanking. Samples will be stored at a Biobanking 
facility for future research.
11 a) These measurements are to be completed by [CONTACT_199085]/her own, without any help from or interpretation by [CONTACT_577059]. If the patient is too sick to complete the questionnaires 
him/herself but is able to reply verbally, a member of the study tea m should read the instructions, questions, and response options aloud to the patient and collect the patient’s verbal 
response in as neutral and unbiased manner as possible .If this is not possible either, the questionnaires are not to be completed. The or der of completion for PROs is recommended to be as 
following: PSS; DLQI: PainVAS; EQ -5D-5L; WPAI -GPP; SF -36; PGI -S and PGI -C. 
11 b) DLQI, EQ -5D-5L, PGI-S and PGI -Care to be completed at V2, V3, V4, V5, V8, V11 and V14/Eo S1visit only.

13Local tolerability at the adm inistration site of BI 655130/placebo (s.c.) will be assessed during the study drug administration and at the time of AE assessment by [CONTACT_577061]. Any observed local tolerability reaction (s), e.g. swelling, induration, heat, redness , pain, andother findings should be reported as an adverse event. 
14V14 will be recorded as the End of Study visit (i.e., EoS1) for patients who qualify and agree to enter the OLE trial (1368 -0025). V14 will also be recorded as End of Study Visit (EoS 1)
for patients who prematurely discontinue with the last dose of treatment up to and including Day 232 and who agree to complete all remaining study visits up to Wk 48 from 
randomization. Since these patients prematurely discontinued, they would not qualify to enter OLE trial. See section [IP_ADDRESS] .

2Vital signs: a) On non-study –drug administration days, vital sign assessments are to be done prior to blood sampling; b) On (i.v.) study drug administration days, vital signs will be 
assessed at predose (prior to blood sampling) , at approximately 5 mins after the end of infusion, and 1 hour after the end of infusion; c) On (s.c.) study drug administration days, vital signs 
will be assessed at pre -dose (prior to blood sampling ) and 10 mins after the end of drug administration. Refer to Section 5.2.2 .
3Fever will be assessed at the day the patient presents to the clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576997].  If the patient will receive medication for fever treatment, the 
fever assessment will be performed prior to taking the anti-fever treatment. This fever assessment must be taken whether or not the patient has an elevated temperature and whether or no t 
the p atient will require anti-fever treatment.
4Only applicable for women of childbearing potential. S – serum pregnancy test. U – urine pregnancy tests will be performed at all other visits indicated. Urine
pregnancy testing should be done prior to study drug administration. Study drug should only be administered in case of a negative test result. In case of a positive urine pregnan cy test, a 
serum pregnancy (S) test will be done (via central lab with the exception of R1 and R3 (if patient qualifies to receive i.v. dosing) visits where serum pregnancy test can be perfo rmed 
locally )) and study drug administration will be postponed until negative result of serum pregnancy test is available.
5ECG mea surements should always precede blood sampling and drug administration
6Safety laboratory tests include clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation, and urinalysis, and will be performed centrally . Local Labs are to be used for dosing decisions prior to i .v. 
administration. For all other visits, central labs are to be used. . See Section 5.2.3 and Table 5.2.3: 1 .
7Photographs of skin /skin lesions are to precede skin biopsies and study drug administration.
8Skin biopsy is optional and is only to be done for patients who have consented for this procedure. Skin biopsies (optional) w ill be collected for each of the three visits (R1 , R6 and EoS1 
visit): 1 lesional or non -lesional (if no lesions are present) skin biopsy of 5 mm punch (split into half for IHC and RNASeq) should be collected prior to study drug administration. 
 
.
10These measurements are to be completed by [CONTACT_199085]/her own, without any help from or interpr etation by [CONTACT_88360]. If the patient is too sick to complete the questionnaires
him/herself but is able to reply verbally, a member of the study team should read the instructions, questions, and response o ptions aloud to the patient and collect the pati ent’s verbal 
response in as neutral and unbiased manner as possible . If this is not possible either, the questionnaires are not to be completed. The order of completion for PROs is recommended to be as 
following: PSS; For PRO completion by [CONTACT_577060], please refer to Section 6.2 for further guidance and details.  
11 HCRU (healthcare resource utilization) data include the number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576998], as we ll as the number of outpatient visits and emergency room visits (If 
applicable). Data should be collected for the time period since the last visit.
12Local tolerability at the administration site of BI 655130 will be assessed during the study drug administration (i.v. or s.c.) and at the time of AE assessment by [CONTACT_577061]. Any observed local tolerability reaction, e.g. swelling, induration, heat, redness , pain, and other f indings should be reported as an adverse event.
13If the first dose of OL s.c. maintenance treatment is outside of any scheduled visit window by ±7 days per Flow Chart 1 , it needs to be assigned to one of the scheduled visi ts by 
[CONTACT_577064] -13/+14 days of the original planned visit date. See Table 3.1:1 for the detailed rules of visit assignment. Then the following OL s.c. maintenance 
doses (if applicable) will be administered within original visit window by ±7 days per Flow Chart 1. Note: Once the OL s.c. visit assignment is calculated by [CONTACT_577065] 1, all 
study procedures scheduled for this first dose of OL s.c. maintenance treatment visit and subseq uent OL maintenance treatment visits should be completed as per  Flow Chart 2 .
14Visit at Week 48 of randomization will be planned for all patients who receive rescue treatment with BI 655130. It will be recorded as the End of Study visit (i.e. , EoS1 ) for patients who 
qualify and agree to enter the OLE trial (1368 -0025). V14 will also be recorded as End of Study Visit (EoS1) for patients who prematurely discontinue with the last dose of  treatment up 
to and including Day 232   and who agree to complete all remaining study visits up to Wk 48 from randomization. Since these patients prematurely discontinued, they would not qualify to 
enter OLE trial. See section [IP_ADDRESS] .
15EoS2 isapplicable for patients who do not qualify or who do not agree to enter OLE trial (1368 -0025) at Week [ADDRESS_756794] dose of treatment after Day 232. Since these patients prematurely dis continued, they would not qualify to enter OLE trial . .

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Clinical Presentation of Generalized Pustular Psoriasis (GPP):
The severe skin and s ystemic auto inflammatory  disease GPP is a rare, serious condition that 
presents as recurring epi[INVESTIGATOR_576999] (R15-
1421 , R16-0933 ), representing a true medical emergency  with potentially  life threatening 
consequences.  The seriousness of the condition is reflected in the man y systemic 
complications of GPP and the associated mortality.  
In order to adequatel y treat GPP, flares need to be treated, but maintenance therap y also 
needs to be given to prevent future flares.
Treatment of acute GPP flares aims at the rapid control of the serious condition via 
controlling the s ystemic signs (CRP, fever, neutrophilia) and pustulation (e.g. visible sign of 
the inflammation) to prevent infection and onset of other complications mak ing the event life 
threatening. In addition, the rapid response to associated dermatologic lesions (response to at 
least almost clear) and s ymptoms is key  and the sustained control of the signs and sy mptoms 
of the GPP flare. 
As descriptions for GPP are discordant among standard dermatology  textbooks (R17-3403), 
the European Rare And Severe Psoriasis Expert Network (ERASPEN) has defined consensus 
criteria that include as key diagnosis criteria for acute GPP the presence of prima ry, sterile, 
macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_577000] -acral skin (excluding cases where pustulation is 
restricted to psoriatic plaques), with or without systemic inflammation, with or without 
plaque -type psoriasis, either relapsing (>1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) or persisten t (>3 months).
Chronic GPP describes the state in between disease flares that may  be characterized b y the 
persistence of residual skin sy mptoms such as ery thema and scaling and minor pustulation.
Co-morbidities:
The classic presentation of acute GPP was first described as a recurrent pustular form of 
psoriasis by  [CONTACT_577067] 1909 (R16-0932) . While GPP and plaque psoriasis can occur 
at the same time in an individual patient (R17-3403) , GPP is dis tinct from plaque psoriasis in 
clinical presentation, pathophy siology , histopathology , response to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], epi[INVESTIGATOR_577001].
The clinical presentation of GPP is quite different from psoriasis vulgaris (PV) in its’ 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_496574], often with n ormal appearing skin between very  acute and severe disease 
flares. GPP is clinically  characterized by  [CONTACT_577068] t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_577002]. In addition, the histopathological hallmarks of GPP 
are distinct spongiform pustules of Kogoj located in the subcorneal portion of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]. 
GPP may  be associated with sy stemic s ymptoms (fever, increased CRP and neut rophilia) and

c28020464-03 Clinical Trial Protocol Page 24of 194

with GPP may  have pre -existing or co- existing PV, it is possible to clinically  distinguish 
patients with primary  plaque disease (PV) who have a seco ndary  pustular component from 
patients who have primary  pustular disease (GPP) with a concomitant plaque component, 
based on the sequence of manifestations (primary  lesion pustule rather than plaque) and the 
localization of a GPP pustule on an ery thematous base rather than a PsO plaque.  
Treatment options
Current treatment options for controlling acute flare of GPP and maintenance of response and 
prevention of future flares are limited and do not provide sustained efficacy (R16-0933) . No 
treatments are currentl y approved for GPP in the US and no centrally approved treatments are 
available in the EU, though retinoids, oral steroids, cy closporine or methotrexate are being 
recommended (R17-3600 ). Although these treatments are described to be effective in 70 –
84% of patients ( R17-3600 ) these data observations are based on a retrospective cohort stud y 
from Japan without clearly  defined endpoints ( R17-3626) . Furthermore, t hese treatments 
cannot be used long- term due to side effects and contraindicatio ns (retinoids: teratogenicit y, 
hair loss; cy closporine: excessive hair growth, renal toxicity ; MTX: liver toxicity ).
Secukinumab (Cosenty x®), infliximab (Remicade®) , ixekizuma b (Taltz®), brodalumab
(Lumicef®), adalimumab (Humira®) ,guselkumab (Tremfy a®), Risankizumab (Skyrizi™ ) , 
and certolizumab (Cimzia®) are onl y registered in Japan for the treatment of GPP and plaque 
psoriasis. For secukinumab, authorization was granted on th e basis of long- term treatment 
data (52 weeks) derived from a single open label clinical trial conducted in 12 patients with 
chronic GPP and an endpoint at 16 weeks ( R16-1462 ). Treatment trials supporting licensing 
in Japan have treated residual disease for an extended period of time, providing no evidence 
of how to appropriately  treat acute GPP flares.  
Biologics (mostly  TNF inhibitors, occasionally  IL-1 or IL -17 inhibitors ) are increasingly  used 
to treat more severe, extensive or treatment resistant patients with GPP, based on small 
published case series (R17-3603 ). However, these drugs are also associated with limitations 
in efficacy  (incomplete and delay ed responses are frequent) and safet y as well as 
contraindications (infusion reactions, tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease). 
Unmet Medical Need 
Acute GPP flares of varying severity  occur in most patients and are commonly  triggered by  
[CONTACT_577069], such as infection, corticosteroid use or withdrawal, non adherence and dose 
reduction of current standard of care treatment , stress or pregnancy  (R16-0933 ). Moderate or 
severe GPP flares cause significant morbidit y and mortality  (R16- 0933) due to tender, painful 
skin lesions, extreme fatigue, high fever, peripheral blood neutrophilia and acute phase 
response and sepsis. 
GPP flares are a true medical emergency  requiring urgent intervention to 
stop the inflammation. I f the inflammation is not controlled quickly , there is sloughing of the 
skin leaving the bod y unprotected from external pathogens resulting in bacteremia, most 
commonly  staph sepsis and unable to prevent the leakage of essential proteins and 
electrol ytes. The consequence is hy poalbuminemia, peripheral edema, h ypovolemic and/or

without supportive care is substantial.
The acute phase is associated with a mean duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] 10 day s (range 3 -44 
days) (R16-0933). Patients with GPP are known to be at an increased risk of death  (R16-

(R17-3456). In the US, Zelickson et al (R17- 3605) conducted a case series on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_577003] o clinic from 1961 to 1989 and reported a mortality  rate of 
3.2%. The most commonly  reported causes of death in GPP patients were related to sepsis.
Mortality  rates are also likely  underestimated due to lack of identify ing the cause of death as 
GPP and are largel y driven by  [CONTACT_577070] -cutaneous organ 
manifestations such as renal, hepatic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_577004] ( R16-0933 ). After 
responding to treatment or spontaneous flare cessation, it is estimated that up to 50% of
patients may  suffer from chronic GPP characterized by  [CONTACT_577071]. 
Moreover, in countries with lower incidence of GPP, the differential diagnosis can be 
delay ed.  This is partl y due to the absence of a treatment p rotocol for GPP once it is 
diagnosed.
Based on the limitations described above, current therapeutic options are not suitable for life -
long treatment and do not provide sustained responses in most patients. Therefore, there is a 
high need to develop (i) a highl y effective treatment with rapid onset of action for patients 
presenting with an acute GPP flare; and (ii) to develop an effective treatment for prevention 
of the occurrence of flares that is safe and tolerable for lifelong treatment.
Role of IL -
36R Signaling in GPP
The classic presentation of GPP flares as described by [CONTACT_577072] y correlated 
with poly morphisms in the IL36 -R signaling pathway  (R15- 1421, R14 -5158 ) . Individuals 
with loss-of- function mutations of the IL36RN gene which encodes an endogenous IL36R 
antagonist (IL -36RN) have dramatically  higher incidence of GPP, indicating that 
uncontrolled upregulation of IL36 signaling due to defective IL36RN antagonism leads to the 
inflammatory  epi[INVESTIGATOR_577005]. Genetic human studies have demonstrated the 
occurrence of GPP clusters in families with a loss of function mutation in IL36RN, which 
results in uncontrolled IL36R signaling ( R14-5158 ).  Mutations in other genes linked to the 
IL36 pathway  such as CARD14 ( R16-0929 )also lead to GPP. A recently  published gene 
expression study  indicates sustained activation of IL -1 and IL -36 in GPP, inducing neutrophil 
chemokine expression, infiltration, and pustule formation, concluding that the IL -1/ IL -36 
inflammatory  axis is a potent driver of disease pathology  in GPP (R17-3602) . Moreover, a 
recent meta -analy sis investigated 233 published GPP cases. They  found that 49 (21.0%) of 
233 ca ses carried recessive IL36RN alleles. Those 49 recessive IL36RN alleles defined a 
GPP phenoty pe characterized by  [CONTACT_577073] s ystemic inflammation (R16-
0930 ).

novel member of the IL1R family  that forms a heterodimeric complex with the IL1R 
accessory  protein. The heterodimeric IL36R s ystem with stimulating (IL36α, IL36β, IL36γ) 
and inhibitory  ligands (IL36Ra) shares a num ber of structural and functional similarities to 
other members of the IL1/IL1R family , such as IL1, IL18 and IL33 ( R17-3602 ). All IL1 
family  members (IL1α, IL1β, IL18, IL36α, IL36β, IL36γ, and IL38) signal through a unique, 
cognate receptor protein which, upon ligand binding, recruits the common IL1RacP subunit 
and activates NFkB and MAP kinase pathway s in receptor -positive cel l types. In human skin 
tissues, IL36R is expressed in keratinocy tes, dermal fibroblasts and infiltrating m yeloid cells.  
IL36R activation in skin tissue drives the production of inflammatory  mediators (e.g. CCL20, 
MIP-1β, TNF -α, IL12, IL17, IL23, TGF -β) an d modulates the expression of tissue 
remodeling genes (e.g. MMPs, TGF -β). Therefore, the link between GPP and mutations in 
the IL36RN is somewhat analogous to the well-established neonatal onset of sterile 
multifocal osteomy elitis, periostitis, and pustulosis caused b y absence of interleukin -
1–
receptor antagonist. In this case, absence of the receptor antagonist allows unopposed action 
of interleukin -1, resulting in life -threatening s ystemic inflammation with skin and bone 
involvement (R17-3602) . These clin ical features responded to empi[INVESTIGATOR_577006] -1–receptor antagonist anakinra (P09- [ZIP_CODE] ).
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
Mode of action
BI 655130 is a humanized antagonistic monoclonal IgG1 antibod y that block s human IL36R 
signaling. Binding of BI 655130 to IL36R is anticipated to prevent the subsequent activation 
of IL36R by  [CONTACT_190216] (IL36 α, β and γ) and downstream activation of pro-
inflammatory  and pro
-fibrotic pathway s with the aim to reduce epi[INVESTIGATOR_577007]/ fibroblast/ 
immune cell -mediated inflammation and interrupt the inflammatory  response that drives 
pathogenic cy tokine production in inflammatory  diseases including generalized pustular 
psoriasis (GPP), palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), Atopic Dermati tis (AD) , Hidradenitis 
Supp urativa (HS) and inflammatory  bowel disease (IBD).
Key pharmacokinetic characteristics
BI 655130 has been characterized b y typi[INVESTIGATOR_226798]1 monoclonal antibody pharmacokinetics. 
PK data showed that exposure increased with increasing dose in a dose proportional manner 
from 0.3 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg following IV administration of BI 655130 to healthy  volunteers. 
The half -life of BI 655130 was approximately  4 weeks in the linear dose range in healthy  
volunteers and approximately  3weeks in GPP patients . PK data suggests target- mediated 
drug disposition (TMDD) kinetics for BI 655130 at doses lower than 0.3 mg/kg . Comparing 
the exposures between the 300 mg SC dose and 300 mg IV dose, a SC bioavailability  of 
~70% was determined. No di fferences in PK were observed between Caucasians and 
Japanese subjects.

observed in 3/ 20 (15.0%) subjects in the placebo group and in 8/5 8 (13.8%) subjects treated 
with BI 655130. The most frequent treatment
-emergent AEs were nasophary ngitis (BI

illness (BI 655130: 
6.9%; PBO: 10.0%), and diarrhea (BI 655130: 3.4%; PBO: 10.0%). There 
were two AEs of moderate intensity  (injection site haematoma, headache), all remaining AEs 
were of mild intensity . There were no serious AEs, no AEs that led to discontinuation of trial 
drug, no protocol -

No relevant changes were observed in safet y laboratory  tests, vital signs, and

Overall, multiple i.v. doses of 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, as well as single and multiple 
doses of 20 mg/kg BI 655130 were found to be safe and well tolerated b y the health y male

Safety
Single doses of BI [ADDRESS_756817] discontinued trial medication 
due to an AE (panic attack) beginning shortly  after the start of the infusion, which was 
considered possibl y related to trial drug administration. The overall incidence of AEs was 
higher in the 300 mg dose groups (both IV and SC) than the 150 mg SC group (300 mg BI 
IV: 11 subjects, 91.7%; 300 mg BI SC: 11 subjects, 91.7%; 150 mg BI SC: 8 subjects, 
66.7%). This difference was mainly  driven by  [CONTACT_577074]. Since AUC and 
Cmax were substantially  lower for 300 mg BI SC than for 300 mg BI IV, there was no clear 
exposure /AE relationship. The incidence of AEs assessed as possibl y drug -related b y the 
investigator was higher in the SC groups than in the IV group (150 mg BI SC: 5 subjects,

IL36R signaling with the humanized anti -IL36R antibody  BI 655130 ( Spesolimab ) would be 
beneficial in treatment of GPP flares as well as in prevention of flares.  In addition, a recent 
characterization of individuals with homozy gous IL36R KO mutations revealed that normal

Current treatment options for controlling acute flare of GPP, complete resolution of 
symptoms and prevention of reoccurrence of flares are limited and do no t provide sustained

in the US or centrall y approved for GPP in the EU, though a combination of retinoids, 
cyclosporine or methotrexate has been recommended as primary  option for controlling 
worsening of chronic GPP (R17-3600) . The use of these for treatment or prevention of GPP 
flare is based o n anecdotal retrospective case reports, making this trial prospectivel y testing a 
treatment that has shown efficacy  for acute flare more important to conduct. Preventing GPP 
flares with a safe and effective treatment will meet a high unmet need to have a p roven

Benefit -Risk Assessment in context of COVID -19 pandemic for patients participating in 
clinical trials investigating Spesolimab:
A thorough assessment based on the data available as of 18 May  2020 has been conducted to 
evaluate whether spesolimab may  pose a higher risk associated with COVID- 19 infection. 
Additionally , the general risk of COVID -19 infection in context of the trial population’s

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_756843] -03(17.0) / Saved on18Mar 2019underly ing disease and common co -morbidities was assessed. The key  aspects of the 
assessment are summarized below. 
Spesolimab is an immune- modulating humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the human 
IL-[ADDRESS_756844] . Available non- clinical and 
clinical data in 378 subjects (see Investigators Brochure Version 7) have not shown an 
increased risk of infections with spesolimab. However, as reflected in Table 1.4.2:[ADDRESS_756845]  targeted 
by [CONTACT_577079]. Considering the current knowledge of COVID- 19 and the implemented risk 
mitigation measures addressing the potential risk of infections, p atients studied in trials with 
spesolimab are not believed to be at higher risk of COVID
-19 due to their background or 
concomitant diseases. Protocol- defined procedures do not impose undue risk to study  
participants. 
The benefit -
risk assessment of spesol imab remains favourable in the context of the COVI D-
19 pandemic. Patients participating in trials with spesolimab are expected to benefit from trial 
treatment and interruption of treatment may worsen their disease. Published guidance for the 
use of biologi cs during the COVID- 19 pandemic recommends to continue treatment with 
biologics (e.g. NICE COVID- 19 rapid guideline: severe asthma [R20-2257], American 
College of Allergy , Asthma&Immunology [R20-2258] , and National Psoriasis Foundation
[R20-2256 ]). In line with this guidance no s ystematic testing for SARS -CoV -2 is required to 
be performed on the trial. However, the investigator may choose to perform the testing as per 
his/he r discretion if useful based on individual medical consideration and in the case of 
suspected COVID -19 infection. Patients may  receive COVID -19 vaccination in line with 
local recommendations/guidance and approved labels. However, it is not known whether 
there is an y negative impact of spesolimab on the protective effect of COVID -[ADDRESS_756846] of SARS-
CoV -2 infection. As an y other acute infection a suspected or diagnosed COVID- 19 infection

should be considered. In case of a confirmed infection, trial treatment will be discontinued 
immediately  and appropriate measures for monitoring, treatment and quarantine will be 
implemented. The investigators will take the totality of information related to each single 
patient and the local COVID -19 situation into consideration when performing the individual 
benefit -risk assessment on a case -by-case basis. The patient may  resume trial treatment 
following recovery  from a SARS -CoV -2 infection if the patient is expected to derive clinical 
benefit, as 
agreed between the investigator and sponsor.
1.4.3 Discussion
Considering the medical need of the development of an effective and well tolerated drug for 
preventing GPP flares and the demonstrated effectiveness of BI 655130 (Spesolimab ) for 
treatment of incident flares , the benefit of this trial is considered to outweigh the potential 
risks for and justifies the administration of BI 655130 ( Spesolimab ) to patients with
Generalized Pustular Psoriasis (GPP). Due to the lack of mechanism- or compound -related 
safet y signals and the antagonistic mode of action of BI 655130 it is considered likel y that 
GPP patients will not be exposed to undue
risks.

2.1 M AIN OBJECTIVES , PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
2.1.1 Main objectives
The present 
trial will be performed to characterize the dose -response curve for BI 655130 in 
patients with a history  of GPP (per European Rare and Severe Psoriasis Expert Network 
(ERASPEN )criteria) who are now (at screening and at randomization) presenting with a 
GPPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear, or almost clear) . 
The primary  objective of the trial is to demonstrate a non-flat curve and evaluate the dose-
response relationship for 3 subcutaneous dos ingregimens of BI 655130 (with each regimen 
consisting of a single loading dose and a separa te maintenance subcutaneous dosing regimen ) 
versus placebo , on the primary  endpoint, the time to the first GPP flare onset up to week 48.
The secondary  objective is to demonstrate superiority  versus placebo for each of BI [ADDRESS_756849] one GPP flare up to 48 weeks.
Treatment comparisons will be made for randomized patients regardless of treatment 
adherence or discontinuation, and any  use of rescue medication or investigator -prescribed 
SoC prior to week 48 (see Section 3.1 for definition), will be considered to represent the 
onset of a GPP flare.
Another objective isto evaluate safet y and tolerability  of multiple s.c. doses of BI 655130 in 
patients with history  of GPP.
Theuse of i.v. dose of BI 655130 for treating patients with onset of acute GPP flare will be 
evaluated for safet y and ef ficacy  as an additional objective .
2.1.2 Primary endpoint(s)
The primary  endpoint of the study  is: 
Time to first Generalized Pustular Psoriasis ( GPP)flare (defined by [CONTACT_577080] (GPPGA) score by  ≥ 2
from baseline and the pustular component of GPPGA ≥ 2) up to week [ADDRESS_756850] of Care ( SoC), will be considered to 
repres ent a GPP flare onset.

Key Secondary  Endpoint :
For the secondary  objective of the trial onl y, the key secondary endpoint which is included in 
the statistical testing strategy  (see Section 7for details) in a hierarchical manner subsequent 
to performance of the test on the primary  endpoint is:
The o ccurrence of a t least one GPP flare (defined by  [CONTACT_577081]  ≥ 2 
from baseline and the pustular component of GPPGA ≥ 2) up to week 48.
For the estimand concept on the above -defined key  secondary  endpoint definition, any  use of 
rescue medication, or investigator -prescribed SoC, prior to week 48 will be considered to 
represent the onset of a GPP flare .
For the primary  objective (i.e., dose-finding anal ysis) of the trial, this endpoint will be 
considered as secondary  in nature only  instead of key  secondary .
Secondary  Endpoints :
The below -defined secondary  endpoints, f or the secondary  objective of the trial only , are 
included into the statistical testing strategy in a hierarchical manner subsequent to 
performance of the test on the key  secondary  endpoint. The study  is not powered for the 
performance of these additional statistical comparisons.
Time to first worsening of Psoriasis Sy mptom Scale ( PSS)up to week 48 defined as a 
4-point increase in total score from baseline. Intake of rescue medication, or 
investigator -
prescribed SoC, will be considered as onset of a worsening.
Time to first worsen ing of Dermatology  Quality  of L ife Index ( DLQI )up to week 48 
defined as a 4-point increase in total score from baseline. Intake of rescue medication, 
or investigator -prescribed SoC, will be considered as onset of a worsening.
The below -defined secondary  endpoints, f or the secondary  objective of the trial only , arenot 
included into the statistical testing strategy .
Sustained remission, defined as a patient with a GPPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN 
This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase IIb 
study  comprising of 3 active doses compared to placebo in adolescents from 12 y ears to less 
than 18 y ears of age and adult patients with history  of GPP and currently  presenting (at 
screening and at randomization) with a GPPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) . Active 
treatment arms consist of active loading dose and active maintenance treatme nt. Please see 
Section 2.1.1 for details regarding the main objectives of the trial.  
Approximately  120 eligible patients with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms (See Figure 3.1: 1 ):
Arm 1: BI 655130 600 mg total loading dose at Week 1/Day 1 followed by  
[CONTACT_577057] 300 mg s.c. q4 weeks
Arm 2: BI 655130 600 mg total loading dose at Week 1/Day 1 followed by

Arm 3: BI 655130 300 mg total loading dose at Week 1/Day 1 followed by  
[CONTACT_577057] 150 mg s.c. q12 weeks
Arm 4 : Placebo Loading dose Placebo at Week 1/Day  1 followed by  [CONTACT_577082], use of s ystemic 
GPP medications at randomization (yes versus no)(see Section 7.4 ),andthe blocking factor s, 
region (Japan versus Non -Japan )and population (Adults versus Adolescents) (see Section 
7.4). A sufficient number of patients will be screened to meet the treatment goal of [ADDRESS_756855] 8 adolescent patients . Patients are considered enrolled (screened) in 
the study  once they  have signed the informed consent. All patients will receive the first dose 
of study  medication on Day  1. 
Each randomized patient will receive 4 injections (loading dose) at Week 1/Day  1 followed 
by 2 injections (maintenance treatment) atsubsequent visits until Week 44 if no flare occurs. 
This is required to keep the blinding. Please refer to Section 4.1.4 and Table 4.1.4: [ADDRESS_756856] either completed or earl y discontinued from the 48 week maintenance treatment period.
Patients will be offered to enter into an open label extension (OL E) trial (1368 -0025), if they  
have completed the treatment period in this study  up to EoS1(i.e. without premature 
discontinuation of trial treatment) , agree to participate in the OLE trial a nd meet the 
eligibility  criteria for the OL E trial.

have qualified, but do not agree to participate in the OLE trial, will be followed as described 
insection [IP_ADDRESS] handling of patients with premature treatment discontinuation.
The primary  anal ysis of this trial is planned to be performed once all randomized patients
have completed or earl y discontinued from the 48 week treatment period; a database lock for
the primary  analy sis will then be performed. Final anal ysis is planned to be performed at the
end of the trial once all randomized patients have completed the trial (including an y follow -
upperiod) if applicable.
The pr imary  anal ysis and final anal ysis may  be performed as a single anal ysis (at the time of
trial completion), if, prior to the time of the primary  anal ysis,the trial team agrees that the 
expected time interval between the planned anal yses is insufficient to justify  the performan ce 
of separate analy ses.
Handling of GPP Flares : 
If a patient experiences the first GPP flare (increase in GPPGA score by  ≥ 2from baseline 
and the pustular component of GPPGA ≥ 2)during 
the randomized maintenance treatment 
period, a rescue treatment with i.v. open label dose of 900 mg BI 655130 should be
administered (R1/D1). The investigators should encourage the patient to inform them at the 
first signs of onset of a GPP flare. If a patient suspects that they  have a GPP flare i n between 
the protocol specified scheduled visits, they  should contact [CONTACT_577083]/site for assessment. After 
confirming the onset of a GPP flare requiring treatment and subseq uentl y receiving the i.v. 
dose of BI 655130, the patients will be seen at R2/D4 and R3/D8 of week1(daily  if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) , wee k 2,week 3,week 4,and week 8 of the rescue treatment period (see Flow 
Chart 2). A patient may  qualify  to receive another rescue treatment with open label i.v. dose 
of 900 mg of BI 655130 at R3/D8, if either of the following criteria are met.
For patients with GPPGA score of  ≥3 and a pustular component of GPPGA of 
≥2 at R1 : the total GPPGA is ≥2 and the pustular component of GPPGA is  ≥2 at 
R3/D8.
For patients with GPPGA score of 2 and a pustular component of GPPGA of ≥2 
at R1: the pustular component of GPPGA is  ≥2 at R3/D8.
For patients who receive the administration of the first rescue treatment with open label i.v.

If a patient on randomized (blinded) treatments experiences disease worsening but does not

GPP Disease Worsening Disease worsening is defined as worsening of clinical 
status or GPP skin and systemic sy mptoms requiring 
treatment intervention in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. In the 
case that rescue medication with BI 655130 has not been 
given before , it is recommended, however, to wait until a 
patient meets the definition of a GPP flare in order that 
rescue medication could be administered instead of SoC .
GPP Flare Increase in GPPGA score by  ≥ 2 from baseline *and the 
pustular compone nt of GPPGA

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_756880] -03(17.0) / Saved on18Mar [ZIP_CODE].2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING T HE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
The rationale of this phase IIb trial is to provide dose-ranging data for 3 dose regimens of BI 
655130 compared to placebo and demonstrate a non -
flat dose response curve, as well as to 
provide statistical evidence regarding the superiority  for BI dose vs. placebo on the primary  
and key  secondary  endpoint. This trial with BI  655130 and placebo is to be conducted in 
patients with a known history  of frequent GPP flares and currentl y (at screening and at 
randomization) with GPPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear/almost clear) .Patients with frequent flares 
(with at least 2 presentations/ year, at least one of which had evidence of either fever and/or 
elevated CRP and / or elevated W B
C.) of GPP without background medication or patients 
under treatment with background medications which is not adequatel y controlling the disease 
or not well tolerate d are the primary  group with an unmet need for a proven, safe treatment to 
prevent flares.  Thus, these patients are proper study  population to participate in this trial . In 
trial 1368.11 (PoCP trial in GPP), the patients had a treatment free period (no ot her 
concomitant GPP treatments) during which all flares were successfull y treated with BI 
655130. As all patients experiencing flares in that trial were successfully  treated, treating 
with placebo in this trial (1368 -0027) is a reasonable control to provi de an estimate of the 
number of flares prevented by  [CONTACT_577087] 655130.  Treatment of the incident flares with 
intravenous BI [ADDRESS_756881] alrea dy been evaluated in trial 1368 - 0013 .  
Based on data from 1368.11 whi ch demonstrated rapid treatment onset of control of flare 
symptoms and resolution including sustained response up to 20 weeks , a parallel group, 
randomized, double -blind and placebo controlled trial where GPP patients with GPPGA score 
of 0 or 1 (clear/almost clear) was considered most appropriate to evaluate the efficacy , safety
and tolerability of BI [ADDRESS_756882] a medical need to treat , will be offered rescue treatment 
with open label i.v. dose of BI 655130.
The incidence of flares in an untreated population is unknown, so a placebo regimen is 
essential for this trial.  Demonstrating a high incidence is essential to demonstrating that 
patients benefit from preventive treatment.  No active control group is included in this trial as 
there is currentl y no drug approved for the prevention of GPP flare . Secukinum ab 
(Cosenty x®), infliximab (Remicade®), ixekizumab (Taltz®), brodalumab (Lumicef®), 
adalimumab (Humira®) ,guselkumab (Tremfy a®),Risankizumab and certolizu mab 
(Cimzia®) are only  registered in Japan for the treatment of GPP. For secukinumab, 
authorization was granted because of long
-term treatment data (52 weeks) derived from a 
single open label clinical trial conducted in 12 patients with chronic GPP symptoms and an 
endpoint at 16 weeks (R16-1462). In the absence of a treatment studied in controlled trials for 
prevention, the results of any  active control would not be interpretable in comparison to 
Spesolimab. Moreover, due to the absence of approved drugs and a commonly  accepted 
treatment algorithm, patients in this trial w ould have a very  heterogenous pre -treatment

selection of suitable active comparator which is relevant for all patients. 
Thus, study  1368-0027 will be a multicenter, ra ndomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
Phase II bdose finding study  with multiple doses of BI 655130 /placebo in patients with 
history  of GPP 
flares and currentl y (at the time of screening and at randomization) with 
GPPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear/almost c lear). The primary  objectives of this trial are described 
i
nSection 2.1.1. It is planned that p atients willcontinue to receive randomized treatment s
until the end of the treatment period . 
For this trial, it is planned to include patients with history  of GPP regardless of the mutation 
status (the status will be investigated during the trial) for the following reason:
Efficacy  has been seen in GPP patients both with and without the IL36RN mutation (earl y 
response to flare t reatment with BI 655130 in 1368.11).
In addition to the described IL36RN mutation, other mutations in the same gene and other 
genes linked to the IL36 pathway  have been described (please see Section 1.1 “Medical 
Background”).  This points to a general role of the IL36 pathway  as disease trigger/driver.
Mutation status is only  available for a subset of GPP patients.
Patients who show no flare s ymptoms of moderate/severe intensit y at EoS1 and who satisfy  
the inclusion/exclusion criteria of subsequent open-label extension trial (1368- 0025) will 
receive an option to continue receiving treatment for GPP with s.c. dosing o nce the patient 
completes EoS1 on this trial. See Section 3.[ADDRESS_756884] been screened. Investigators 
will be notified about screening completion and will then not be allowed to screen additional 
patients for this trial. Patients alread y in screening and assessed as eligible will be allowed to 
continue to randomisation and treatment .
A suitable number of countries/sites 
will participate globally in order to minimize the risk of 
under recruiting and to meet the goal of 120 patients (including 8 adolescent patients) 
randomized. Due to the rareness of the disease, a high number of sites will participate relative 
to the number of patients required . 
A log of all patient s enrolled into the trial(i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the Investigator Site File ( ISF)irrespective of whether they  have been treated 
with investigational drug or not.
If a patient is randomized in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more 
exclusion criteria), the sponsor should be contac ted immediately .

4.1.2 Selection of doses in the trial anddose modifications
In the proof -of-concept trial 1368.11 in GPP patients, a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg 
of BI 655130 was tested. The proof -of-concept (PoC) for IL36R inhibition in GPP was 
achieved in these patients who showed rapid clinical responses (for further detail, refer to 
Section 1.2 ). GP PASI  score was measured at weeks 1, 4, 12 and 20 and the positive response 
was maintained up to week 20 following this single i.v. dose of BI 655130. Additionally , a 
300 mg s.c dose of BI 655130 has been tested in healthy  volunteers to obtain PK information 
following sub-cutaneous administration of BI 655130.
The aim of the current trial (1368- 0027) is to provide dose -ranging data for 3 subcutaneous 
dosingregimens of BI 655130 with the proposed doses of 300 mg s.c. q4w and 300 mg s.c. 
q12w after a loading dose of 600 mg each and 150 mg q12w after a loading dose of 300 mg . 
These three doses/regimen were selected to test a wide range in exposure to thoroughl y 
evaluate the exposure
-response relationship of BI 655130 in GPP patients.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_756900] -03(17.0) / Saved on18Mar 2019If a patient experiences a GPP flare (increase in GPPGA score b y ≥ 2 from baseline and the 
pustular component of GPPGA ≥ 2) during the randomized maintenance treatment period, a 
rescue treatment with i.v. open label dose of 900 mg BI 655130 is to be admini stered at 
R1/D1. A patient may  qualify  to receive another dose of i.v. open label 900 mg BI 655130 at 
R3/D8 if protocol specified criteria aremet (please refer to Table 3.1:1 ).  The 900 mg BI 
655130 i.v dose was selected based o n positive data from 1368.11 and thus considered 
reasonable to continue with the dose of 10 mg/kg to maintain the PK exposures observed in 
the trial 1368.11. A fixed dose of 900 mg was selected to give the flexibility to recruit 
patients greater than 70 kg body  weight. BI 655130 has been tested in healthy  volunteers up 
to 20 mg/kg (given week lyin the MRD trial 1368.2) and was shown to be safe and tolerable. 
Evaluation of the PK data in GPP patients suggest that BI 655130 exposure in patients was 
lower when compared to PK in healthy  volunteers (HVs). Thus, the selected fixed dose (900 
mg single i.v. dose) is anticipated to be within safety  limits for patients with a lower weight 
as well.
Including adolescent patients with a minimum weight of [ADDRESS_756901] 
maintenance dose of 300 mg q4w until week 32 and then receives a 900 mg IV rescue dose at 
week 33 (worst case scenario for exposure, where the IV dose is administered [ADDRESS_756902] s.c. dose representing administration at t max), the predicted median C maxfollowing 
rescue dosing is 487,000 µg/L (314,000 – 756,000 µg/L (90% prediction interval)). This is 
well below the maximum observed concentration of 992,000 µg/L following the maximum 
tested dose of 20 mg/kg qw (x4 doses) in trial 1368.2. 
Similarly , the model predicted median AUC over 12 weeks following rescue dosing is 
9,620,000 µg/L *day (6,320,000 – 14,100,000 µg/L *day  (90% prediction interval)) which is 
well below the model predicted AUC over 12 weeks of 31,900,000 µg/L*day  (26,300,000 –
38,700,000 µg /L*day  (90% prediction interval)) following the maximum tested dose of 20 
mg/kg qw (x4 doses) in trial 1368.2.
The weight cutoff was chosen as 40 kg (median weight of a [ADDRESS_756903]) and not 30 
kg (3rdpercentile for a [ADDRESS_756904]) because t he probability  of exceeding the 
maximum observed concentration was calculated as 0.5% for subjects weighing 40 kg while 
the probability  of exceeding the maximum observed concentration was 4.4% for subjects 
weighing 30 kg.
The expected exposure profile is shown in Figure 4.1.2:1. The blue line and shaded area 
represents the median and 90% prediction interval following 300 mg q4w maintenance 
dosing and then administration of a rescue dose at week 33 for a t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 40 kg adolescent , 
taking into account inter -individual variability  in model parameters. The black line and

although the figure below demonstrates similarity in exposure between adults and adolescents 
forthe highest dose to be tested, this similarity  in exposure holds for all lower dose groups. 
Overall, the dosing regimens to be tested in adolescents is expected to be similar to adults and 
within the safe exposure range established for Spesolimab in adult patients.

4.1.3 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
An Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) will be used to screen eligible patients , perform 
drug assignment, manage initial/re -supply  ordering of drug supplies and handle emergency  
un-blinding. The investigator will receive all necessary  instructions to access the IRT from 
the Sponsor. Detailed IRT functions and procedures will be docum ented in the user 
requirement specifications mutually  agreed to by  [CONTACT_562338].
During V isit 2 and after the patient’s eligibility  is confirmed, patient s will be random i
zed to 
blinded treatment arms according to a randomization plan in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Randomization 
will be stratified by  [CONTACT_50801], concomitant use of systemic GPP medications at
randomization (yes versus no)(see Section 7.4 )and the blocking factor s, region ( Japan 
versus Non-Japan )and population (Adults versus Adolescents) (see Section 7.4 ).The 
assignment will occur in a blinded fashion viaInteractive Response Technology  (IRT).

slowing down the infusion rate, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_51119], and provided no further safety concern 
exists, restarting at a slower rate. Regardless, the total duration of infusion should not exceed 
180 minutes ( 3hours).   Patients should be closely  monitored for signs and sy mptoms of 
hypersensitivity  reactions for 1 hour following the end of i .v. study  drug administration. 
Hypersensitivity  reactions should be treated according to medical standards.  Further based 
on his/her medical judgment the investigator will provide medications as needed. Detailed 
instructions for the preparation of the i.v . infusion solution, the volume to be administered 
and the infusion rate are provided in the I SF.
Subcutaneous administration of biologic agents may involve the risk of local (injection site) 
or sy stemic h ypersensitivity  reactions. Therefore, patients sho uld be closely monitored for 
signs and s ymptoms of injection site or sy stemic hy persensitivity  reactions following study  
drug administration. Study personnel should observe the injection site for signs of redness, 
swelling or hardness. They  should also ask subjects about itching, dizziness or shortness of 
breath. Patients should be advised that if they  experience redness, swelling or other changes 
at the injection site, they  should notify  site personnel. They  should further be advised that if 
they experienc e itching all over or a feeling of being swollen, dizzy  or short of breath, they  
should notify  site personnel or their own healthcare provider immediately .Pre-medications 
for further injections might be considered and will be agreed on between investigato r and BI 
clinical monitor (see also Section 6.2.2).
The administration of the study medication will be done under supervision of the 
investigating ph ysician or a designee at the site. 
Dose modifications or adjustments are not permitted. In exceptional cases of missed or 
delay ed visits, if any  of these visits has to be rescheduled, the date of subsequent visit should 
be calculated from Day  1.In case of missed visits (during the randomized treatment trial 
period), the patien ts should be given the assigned medication for both visits (i.e. up to 1
missed visit and the current visit) at the next scheduled visit.
During the COVID -19 pandemic, phy sical visits to the sites may  need to be restricted to 
ensure patient’s safet y. Based on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, the 
investigator may  still decide to continue the trial treatment and the administration of the study  
medication may  be performed at patient’s home under the supervision of the investigating 
physician or a designee. The trial medication may be shipped to the patient’s home if 
acceptable according to local law and regulations. This must be approved by  [CONTACT_456]’s

the last randomized patient has completed or early discontinued from the 48 week treatment
period of the trial andthe database is considered ready  for unblinding to perform the primary  
analysis of the trial. Note that for theplanned interim analy sis of this trial (see details in 
Section 7.2.7) , only  clinical efficacy  and safet y data fortheOL i.v. rescue treatment and OL 
s.c. maintenance treatment periods are intended to be reported; no unblinding of the initial 
randomized s.c.treatments isrequired .. 
With database lock forthe primary trial analysis, the sponsor (including all trial personnel)
will be officiall y unblinded to t he randomization details; i nvestigators and patients will 
remain blinded until the official end of the trial ( final trial anal ysis)when the last patient has 
completed through 16 weeks of trial safety  follow -
up(if applicable) .
If the trial team agrees to perform the primary  analy sis and final anal ysis as one single 
analysis (at the time of trial completion), then patients, investiga tors, and sponsor personnel 
involved in the trial conduct will be unblinded to the randomized treatment assignments after
the database lock has been performed.
The randomization codes will be provided to bioanaly tics prior to last patient out of the tria l 
to allow for the exclusion from the anal yses of PK samples taken from placebo patients. 
Bioanal ytics will not disclose the randomization code or the results of individual 
measurements until the trial has been officiall y un-blinded to the sponsor. Sample drug levels 
and demographic data together with treatment assignments and dosing information may  be 
made available to named individuals from the bioanaly tics department for the purpose of PK 
dataset generation and analy sis in accordance with thesponsor’s s tandard procedures.
A fully  external DMC will perform an unblinded safet y and efficacy assessment at specified 
intervals in order to ensure that patients are protected from potential harm, please refer to 
Section 8.7 for further details.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] provides the rules surrounding breaking of the randomization code.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator / designee via IRT (for Japan: 
only to the investigator).  I t must only  be used in an emergency  situation when the identity  of 
the trial drug must be known to the investigator in order to provide appropriate medical 
treatment or otherwise assure the safet y of trial p articipants. The reason for unblinding must 
be documented in the source documents and/or appropriate eCRF page along with the date 
and the initials of the person who broke the code.
In case the automated unblinding option via the IRT sy stem is malfunction ing, the IRT 
service provider can be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (24 hours a day  coverage) and the treatment allocation can 
be obtained.  IRT support has direct access to the database and the treatment information can 
be manuall y obtained in case the automated process is no t working properly.  Details about 
this process will be included in the ISF.

Additio nal details for efficacy assessments evaluated in this study  are provided below.  
Methodological details for the evaluation of the scores/index are described in the I SF.
Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Physician Global Assessment (GPPGA)
GPPGA relies on clinical assessment of the GPP patient’s skin presentation. I t is a modified 
PGA, a phy sician’s assessment of psoriatic lesions, which has been adapted to the evaluation 
of GPP patients (R15-5200) . The investigat or (or qualified site personnel) scores the 
erythema, pustules, and scaling of all GPP lesions from [ADDRESS_756928] clear.

The PSS is a 4-item patient- reported outcome (PRO) instrument that was developed to assess 
the severit y of psoriasis symptoms in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (R18-1990). 
When completing this questionnaire, patients should report on s ymptoms experienced from 
their Generalized Pustular Psoriasis. The sy mptoms included are:  pain, redness, itching, and 
burning. Current s ymptom severity  is assessed using a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 
4 (very  severe). The s ymptom scores are added to an unweighted total score (range:  0 to 16).
The PSS instrument is provided in Appendix 10.1.5; this will be measured at the timepoints 
noted in Flow Chart 1 or Flow Chart 2 (as applicable).

The DLQI is a patient -administered, ten -question, quality  of life questionnaire that covers six 
domains including s ymptoms and feelings, dail y activities, leisure, work and school, personal 
relationships and treatment ( R05-2548) . The DLQI has a one - week recall period. Response 
categories include “not relevant” (score of 0), “not at all” (score of 0), “a little” (score of 1), 
“a lot” (score of 2) and “very  much” (score of 3). Question 7 is a “y es”/ “no” question where 
“yes” is scored as 3. DLQI total score is calculated by  [CONTACT_577090] a range of 0 to 30 wher e 0-1 = no effect on patient’s life, 2 -5 = small effect, 6 -10 
= moderate effect, 11 -20 = very  large effect, and 21 -30 = extremel y large effect on patient’s 
life. The higher the score, the more the qualit y of life is impaired. A 4- point change from

causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF andBI SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions.
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judge d clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_1275] .
If such abnormalities already  exist prior to trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is define d as any  AE,which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria :
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might h ave 
caused death if more severe,
-requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_577030]
- results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,
-is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
-is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judg ement which may  jeopard isethe patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
abov e definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88796].

reason”. AE swhich possibly  lead to disability  will be reported as SAEs.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency  initiative on Important Medical Even ts, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by  [CONTACT_15623], can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as 
defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC s ystem. A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be 
reported as SAEs as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing c ancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in [IP_ADDRESS], subsections “AE Collection ”and“AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_756947] (AESI) relates to an y specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring 
and safet y assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from 
other compounds in the same class. AESI sneed to be repor ted to the sponsor ’s 
Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAE s, please see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].2.
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  [CONTACT_15624]:
An elevation of AST and/or AL T and/or AP ≥3 -fold UL N plus 2 times the baseline,
combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2-fold UL N plus 1.5 times the baseline, 
measured in the same blood draw sample, or
aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥ [ADDRESS_756948]
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury  alert and the 
patient s showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF.
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these par ameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed .

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_756950] -03(17.0) / Saved on18Mar [ZIP_CODE].[IP_ADDRESS] Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judg ement should be used to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of a 
causal relationship between the adverse event and the given stud y treatment , considering all 
relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challeng e or re-
challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and 
relevant history . 
Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug .
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re
-introduced.
No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre -
existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned) .
Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
Disappe arance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.

investigator must report all deaths/fatal AEs regardless of relationship, and trial treatment 
related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs the investigator becomes aware of. 
Please refer to Flow Chart 1 or Flow Chart 2 (as applicable) for additional details on vital

Clinical monitoring after study  drug administration:
At visits with s.c. study  drug administration, vital signs w ill be assessed pre-dose and at 
approx. 10 minutes after the end of study  drug administration (s)and at Visit [ADDRESS_756970] -dose ( i.e. [ADDRESS_756971] injection) . Local tolerability  at the administration site of BI 655130 /placebo will be 
assessed b y the investigator during the stud y drug administration (i.v. or s.c.) visit s [as noted 
in the Flow Chart 1 or Flow Chart 2 (as applicable) ] . and at the time of AE assessment by  
[CONTACT_577096]. Any  observed local tolerability  reaction, e.g. 
“swelling”, “induration”, “heat”, “redness” , “pain”, and , “other findings” should be reported 
as adverse event.
They  should also ask subjects about itching, dizziness or shortness of breath. Patients should 
be advised that if they  experience redness, swelling or other changes at the injection site, they  
should notify  site personnel. They  should further be advised that if they  experience itching all 
over or a feeling of being swollen, dizzy  or short of breath, they  should notify  site personnel 
or their own healthcare provider immediatel y.
During i.v. drug administration, vital s igns will be assessed pre -dose, at approximately  5 
minutes after the end of infusion, and 1 hour after the end of infusion. Patients should be 
closely  monitored for signs and sy mptoms of hy persensitivity  reactions for approximately  1 
hour after the end of infusion. Hy persensitivity  reactions should be treated according to 
medical standards.
Unscheduled visits
The investigator should encourage patients to return to the clinic/site at the first sign of onset 
of a GPP flare. If a patient suspects that they  have a GPP flare in between the protocol 
specified scheduled visits, they  should make an unscheduled visit and return to the clinic/site 
for assessment.
The patient may  be called in for additional unscheduled visits due to safety  reason at the 
discretion o f the investigator or the sponsor, unless the patient has withdrawn his/her consent. 
The patient may  also contact [CONTACT_577097]. The 
unscheduled visit may  include additional collection of blood samples for safety  reasons. The 
unscheduled visit may  also include additional assessments deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_577098], ECGs, or other procedures which were missed at a

SAMPLE SIZE
The trial is designed as a randomized, parallel group, double blind, placebo controlled, dose 
finding study to show superiority in the prevention of re -occurrence of flares for 
administration of BI 655130 300 mg q4w (high dose) , 300 mg q12w (medium dose) , and 150 
mg q12w (low dose) respectivel y versus placebo in patients with a history of GPP (per 
ERASPEN criteria) and with a GPPGA score of 0 or 1 (clear, or almost clear) at screening 
and at randomization. 
Primary Objective
The primary  objective is to provide dose-ranging data for [ADDRESS_756976] GPP flare onset up to 
week 48 . Proof of concept for the activit y of BI 655130 will be determined using a multiple 
comparison procedure with modelling techniques (MCPMod) with respect to achieving a 
non-flat dose response curve, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_342336] I error at 0.05, one- sided. 
To achieve this, the log hazard ratio of each active dose vs. placebo is first obtained via a Co x 
regression model on the time to first GPP flare. These estimates are the basis then for the 
non-flat dose response MCPMo dassessment.
Secondary Objective
If the primary  objective regarding achievement of a non -flat dose response curve is 
successful , the secondary objective will then be performed, which is to perform formal 
testing on the superiority  of BI 300 mg q4w and/or BI [ADDRESS_756977] will be implemented for each dose of BI 300 mg q4w (high dose) and BI 300 mg q12w
(medium dose) versus placebo, with stratification by  [CONTACT_139739], concomitant use of sy stemic
GPP medication atrandomization (y es or no), and mul tiplicity  will be controlled by  [CONTACT_577100] (using a truncation fraction of 0.5) . Subsequently , formal 
testing of all other endpoints included in the testing hierarch y (i.e. the key secondary, and 
then the 
secondary  endpoints)  will be performed ,if the test on the primary  endpoint is 
successful for at least one of the two doses (high or medium dose) of BI 655130.

of at least one GPP flare up to week [ADDRESS_756978] ,stratified b y the factor concomitant

one (high or m edium ) dose of BI [ADDRESS_756981] of the 
primary  endpoint ,then the same dose will be tested on the key  secondary  endpoint with a 1-
sided alpha of 0.[ZIP_CODE] ( see Section 7.1 for further details). If neither dose is declared to be 
statistically  significantly  superior to placebo for the primary  endpoint, then no further testing 
in the hierarchical sequence will be conducted. Subsequent tests on the secondary  endpoints 
included in the testing strategy  (i.e. the t ime to first worsening of 
PSS up to week 48, and 
then on the t ime to first worsening of DLQI up to week 48) , as well as tests on the primary  
and key  secondary  endpoints for th e lowest dose of BI [ADDRESS_756982] 
number of target patients with a GPP event only  are included.
To support a potential BI 655130 acute GPP flare treatment submission, an interim analy sis 
of the clinical efficacy  and safety data collected during the BI 655130 OL i.v rescue and s.c. 
maintenance treatment periods may  be perfor med. For further details refer to Section 7.2.7.
The stratification factor, concomitant use of systemic GPP medications at randomization (y es 
or no) and the blocking factors, region (Japan or Non-Japan) and population (Adults versus 
Adolescents) will be included into the randomization of this trial. The blocking factor sof 
region is implemented to ensure that sufficient patients per treatment group are recruited 
specificall y to support individual country  submission in Japan and the blocking factors of
population is implemented to ensure there will be paediatric patients randomized to each 
treatment group to support paediatric investigational plan. The two blocking factors are not 
intended to be used as an adjustment factor in the primary  and key secondary  anal yses of 
efficacy  (See Section 7.2 ).
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
The null and alternative hy potheses are described below. Statistical testing will be performed 
based on one -sided hy potheses with corresponding one -sided p-values. Note that for 
publication purposes also two sided p
-values may be derived if needed . Details of this will be 
specified in the TSAP.
Primary  objective: Dose Finding
The null hy pothesis is that there is a flat dose response curve comparing the placebo and the

If the primary  objective regarding the achievement of a non -flat dose response curve is 
successful , the secondary objective will then be performed, which is to perform forma l
pairwise testing on the superiority  ofthe high and medium doses of BI 655130 versus 
placebo, on each of the endpoint s included in the statistical testing hierarchy as described 
below .
Formal testing of all trial endpoints in the testing hierarchy  (primary , key  secondary , and 
secondary  endpoints) will be performed at a one -sided alpha level of 0.025. The overall 
testing strategy  used to control the ty pe I error for each of the endpoints and for each of the 
treatments is described below. Overall the testing strategy  will follow a closed testing 
principle defining five families of endpoints/comparisons. The first family  and the second 
family  consist of the primary  and key  secondary  endpoint compar isonsfor the high and 
medi umdoses of BI [ADDRESS_756985] of the BI 655130 low dose (BI 655130 300mg

7.2.1 G eneral considerations
There will be 3 main patient populations in this trial for analy ses: the randomized set (RS), 
the safet y set (SAF ), and the per -protocol set (PPS).
Randomized Set 
This patient set includes all randomized patients. Treatment assignment will be as 
randomized. This is the main anal ysis set for presentation of efficacy . 
Safety  Set 
This patient set includes all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of 
study  drug. It will be the main anal ysis set for presentation of safet y. Patients will be 
analyzed according to the actual treatment.
Per-Protocol Set  
This patient set includes all patients in the RS who adhered to the CTP without any  IPVs 
(potentially  affecting the study  outcome) which lead to exclusion from the PPS . This set will 
be used for sensitivity  analy sis on the primary  and key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints which 
are included in the testing hierarch y.
 
Important violations of the protocol will include violations of the key  inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, incorrect medications taken, concomitant use of restricted medications, and an y other 
violations of the protocol deemed important b y the study  team. A ll decisions concerning 
important protocol violations will be made prior to un- blinding of the database for the 
primary  trial anal ysis.
Standard statistical parameters (number of non -missing values, mean, standard deviation 
(SD), median, quartiles, minimu m and maximum) or frequency tables (including patient 
frequencies and percentages) will be calculated where appropriate.
A Clinical Trial Report will be prepared for the primary  anal ysis.
7.2.[ADDRESS_757023] GPP flare up to week 48, defined by  [CONTACT_577102] b y ≥2 and a GPPGA pustulation subscore ≥2, is the primary  endpoint of this trial.
Any use of rescue medication (see Section 3.1 )or investigator -prescribed SoC prior to the 
first onset of a GPP flare is considered to indicate the onset of such a flare. 
Primary  Objective: Dose Finding
The primary  anal ysis for the primary  objective consists of a MCPMod- based testing (with 
respect to a non -flat dose response curve) . MCPMod (mul tiple comparison and modelling

and to identify  the best -fitting model or subset of models (while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_577032] I err or at 0.05, one- sided). 
The generalized MCPMod procedure for time to event endpoints (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_577033]. 2014
[R15-
4293 ]) is based on the log hazard ratio of the active doses vs. placebo obtained via a Cox 
regression model on thetime to first GPP flare. In detail the hazard function for patient i in 
stratum m (systemic concomitant use of GPP medications atrandomization (yes or no)) is 
assumed to have the form

where
-Λ (t)is the hazard for patient i at time t

estimated variance -covariance matrix obtained from the Cox regression model fit. In 
particular the placebo adjusted version of MCPMod will be applied.
For the PoC testing and for the sample size calculation, the contrasts of ea ch of the models to 
be tested must be pre -defined. The following cases has been selected to cover the plausible 
and a diverse range of potential dose response patterns.

rates are rounded to two decimals.

Key Secondary Endpoint Analysis
Primary  Objective: Dose Finding
Forthedose finding analy sis of the study , there are no key  secondary  endpoints defined.
Secondary  Objective: Formal Statistical Testing
For the formal analysis of the study , the treatment effect on the key secondary  endpoint , the 
occurrence of a t least one GPP flare up to week 48, will be tested in a hierarchical manner as 
a part of the pre -specified testing strategy , subsequent to the test of the primary  endpoint, 
which is defined in Section 7.1
The stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haensze l (CMH) test will be performed for each dose of BI 
655130 versus placebo stratified b y the concomitant use of sy stemic GPP medications at
randomization (y es or no) , and based on the RS. The difference in the proportion of patients 
who do not experience a GPP flare, and the associated confidence intervals will be presented 
for each active group versus the placebo group using the Mantel- Haenszel ty pe weighted 
average of differences using weights as proposed by  [CONTACT_577104] & Robins [ R09-1299].
Any use of rescue medication or investigator -prescribed SoC prior to the onset of the first 
GPP flare is considered to represent a failure , i.e. the onset of a GPP flare event . Furthermore, 
as described for the primary  endpoint an alysis, the key  secondary  endpoint anal ysiswill also 
include both on -and off -treatment data of all patients up to Week 48. 
The primary  method for handling of missing data on the occurrence of a t least one GPP flare
is described in Section 7.[ADDRESS_757032] will compare Kaplan Meier estimates at Week 48 
between each dose of BI 655130 and placebo whereb y the variance of each KM estimate is 
calculated b y the Greenwood’s formula. Further details for the landmark test will be 
described in the TSAP. 
Seco ndary Endpoint Analysis :
For the formal analysis of the study , the treatment effect on the following secondary  
endpoints, 1) Time to first worsening of PSS up to week 48 ( defined as a 4 -point increase in 
total score from baseline ),and, 2) Time to first worsening of DLQI up to week 48 ( defined as 
a 4-

part of the pre -specified testing strategy , subsequent to the test of the primary and key  
secondary endpoints, which is defined in Section 7.1. 
The t ime to first worsening of PSS up to week 48, where an y use of rescue medication or

The time to first worsening of DLQI up to week 48, where any use of rescue medication or 
investigator -prescribed SoC will be considered to represent a worsening of the DLQI , will be 
analysed in the same manner as described for the time to first worsening of PSS .
Imputation rules of missing data for the above two secondary  endpoints will be described in 
Section 7.3.
Allsecondary  endpoints will be descriptivel y displayed. Descriptive comparison for adults 
versus adolescents will be performed for secondary  endpoints in the hierarchical testing .
Statistical tests on the remaining secondary binary endpoints will be performed as described 
for the key  secondary  endpoint .
7.2.5 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the current version of Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  
Activities (MedDRA) coding diction ary. Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be 
produced.
All treated patients will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned. 
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent 
adverse events. To this end, all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end 
of the residual effect period will be considered ‘treatment- emergent’; the residual effect 
period (REP) is defined as [ADDRESS_757034] dose of trial medication. Note that for 
patients who continue into the extension trial (1368 -0025), all TEAE up to the time-point of 
first dose of the trial medication in the extension trialwill be available for display  in the 
current stud y. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under 
treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment -emergent’. For all subjects who received 
rescue medication with BI 655130, sa fety assessments including adverse events, laboratories, 
vital signs etc. which occurred subsequent to such intake will be excluded from presentations 
according to the planned treatments; these data will, however, be included in summaries 
where all data af ter an y use of BI 655130 are displayed.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ class (SOC) and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the 
MedDRA at database lock.
The exposure adjusted incidence rate (per [ADDRESS_757035] y ears) of a selected treatment emergent 
adverse event is defined as the number of subjects experiencing the adverse event per

Total AE -specific time at risk [subject y ears].
Laboratory  data will be analy sed both quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory  data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively  with regard to distribution 
parameters as well as with regard to frequency  and percenta ge of patients with abnormal 
values or clinicall y relevant abnormal values.

clinical efficacy  and safety  data collected during the BI 655130 OL i.v rescue treatment and 
s.c. maintenance treatment periods for GPP flare may  be pe rformed. The interim data 
snapshot will include the data from the i.v. rescue treatment period and OL maintenance 
treatment period . The initial r andomized s.c. treatments will remain blinded and the sedata 
will not be analy sed as part of this interim anal
ysis.  The timing of the interim analy sis is 
driven by  [CONTACT_577107]. Further details on the 
specifications for this interim anal ysis will be presented in the trial statistical anal ysis plan.
In order to ensure t he patient’s safety during the trial, a fully external DMC, independent of 
the trial and project teams, will review all available un- blinded safety  data as well as selected 
efficacy  data at regular intervals following first -patient-in. A DMC SAP which desc ribes the

flare events will be included in the primary  anal ysis. No further imputation will be 
implemented on the missing values of GPPGA score and/or missing GPPGA pustule 
subscore. This will be the primary  imputation method for the primary  anal ysis. 
The same 
imputation strategy  will be used for t he two secondary  endpoints, time to first worsening of 
PSS and time to first worsening of DLQI in the hierarchical testing p rocedure . The detailed 
censoring rules as outlined in Table 7.3: 1 will be used.

each visit. 
For Visit 2, the GPPGA subscores (pustules, scaling, ery thema) at Visit [ADDRESS_757046]  but now includ ingthe GPPGA subscores 
(pustules, scaling, ery thema) up to Visit 3, treatment and the response of patient at

All visits after an observed or imputed flare event with 
a flare event are again imputed as an event. Using the same approach, all visits will 
be imputed in order up to Visit 14 (Week 48) . 
2.Analysis of Completed Datasets: The imputed complete dataset will be used to 
perform the corresponding statistical analy sis per permutation as specified in Section 
7.2.3.
3.Combine Results : PROC MI ANALYZE combines the anal ysis results from step 2 
and generates valid statistical inferences b y accounting for the variability introduced 
by [CONTACT_577110]’s rules (R12-2378).
Further imputation rules for secondary endpoints and further endpoints will be described in TSAP if 
necessary. With respect to safety evaluations, it is not planned to impute missing values.
7.[ADDRESS_757047] will be generated using a validated s ystem, which 
involves a pseudo- random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both 
reproducible and non-predictable. Access to the codes will be controlled and documented.
Stratification for the concomitant use of systemic GPP medications 
atrandomization (y es or 
no) will be done. If a patient received an y GPP medication within 4 weeks prior to or at 
randomization, then this patient will be categorized as “y es” and otherwise, “no”. Primary  
and key  secondary  efficacy  anal yses will be performed including an adjustment for this

The block size of the randomization will be documented in the CTR .
The process of randomization is done via an IRT. Practical aspects of the treatment allocation

7.5 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
Based on an application of the defined testing strategy, a power calculation has been 
performed for sample size assessment on the dose finding analysis (primary objective) and on 
the formal analy sis (second ary objective) of the trial.
The effect of each dose of BI 655130 on preventing a GPP flare in patients with a history  of 
GPP will be compared relative to placebo where the high and medium doses of BI 655130 
(300 mg q4w and 300 mg q12w) are assumed to be closel y effective, while the lowest dose 
(150 mg q12w) is assumed to be a sub- therapeutic dose. Most patients will withdraw from 
their prior GPP medication when they enter the trial, therefore the overall GPP flare rate is 
expected to be higher for these p atients within the first three months of the maintenance 
treatment period (due to withdrawal of previous medication being a potential trigger for onset 
of a GPP flare event).
Under the base scenario, the overall hazard ratio between BI 300 mg q4w and plac ebo is 
assumed to be 0.1, between BI 300 mg q12w and placebo is assumed to be 0.15 and between 
BI 150 mg q12w and placebo is assumed to be 0.3. I t assumes a pi[INVESTIGATOR_577035] (i.e., first [ADDRESS_757049] 3 months) for the time to first GPP flare of each arm in 
this trial. I t is anticipated that within the first 3 months of treatment, with dose of BI 300 mg 
q4w, BI 300 mg q12w andBI 150 mg q12w , that approximately  1.7%, 2. 6% and 5.1% of 
patients will experience a first GPP flare per month r espectivel y under the base scenario. In

i.e. approx. 17.1% per month under the base scenario. After [ADDRESS_757051] flare rate after 3 months is 0.3%/month for patients on BI 300 mg q4w, 
0.4%/month for patients on BI 300 mg q12w , 0.9%/month for patients on BI 150 mg q12w

It is expected to take about [ADDRESS_757052] patient completes or earl y discontinue the 48 -
week treatment. At that time, the target number of events will be 27. The powers of this trial 
are not driven b y the target nu mber of events but based on the number of events truly  
observed at the time of primary analysis. 
Table 7.5: 1shows the success probability  estimates for the dose finding analy sis based on 
the primary  endpoint when the primary analysis is performed at the time that the last patient 
has completed or early discontinued 48 -week treatment. All calculations are performed using 
R version 3.5.1, for a sample size of 120 patients (1:1 :1:1ratio), and a [ADDRESS_757053] 
for non -flat dose -response curve .
Based on these assumptions, the success probability  is approximately  99.5% for the base 
scenario described above .
In the case that there is no treatment benefit, the false positive probability  is limited by  [CONTACT_941] α -
level for the significance testing of the non -flat dose -response curve of 5 % (one -sided).

In accordance with regulatory  requirements, the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trialrecords that include all observations and 
other data pertinent to the investigation on each trialpatient . Source data as well as reported 
data should follow the “AL COA principle s” and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original and a ccurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must 
be explained.
The current medical hi
story  of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility  for the 
trialand the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any  
diagnostic tests. In this case ,the investigator must make at least one documented attem pt to 
retrieve previous medical records. If this fails ,a verbal history  from the patient, documented 
in their medical records, would be acceptable.
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol , any  corrective action e.g. re -training must be 
documented in the patient file.
For theCRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example:
Patient identification : gender, year of birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations )
Patient
participation in the trial(substance, trialnumber, patient number, date patient was 
informed)
Dates of patient ’s visits, including dispensing of trialmedication
Medical history  (including trialindication and concomitant diseases, if applicable)
Medicatio nhistory
Adverse events and outcome events (onset date (mandatory ), and end date (if available))
Serious adverse events (onset date (mandatory ), and end date (if available))
Concomitant therap y (start date, changes)
Originals or copi[INVESTIGATOR_577036], with proper 
documented medical evaluation (in validated electronic format, if available)
Completion of patient’s p articipation in the trial”(end date; in case of premature 
discontinuation document the reason for it).
Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there must be 
documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trialparticipant 
meet s all inclusion criteria and does not meet any  exclusion criteria. The absence of 
records (either medical records , verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing 
conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion/exclusion criteria does not make
the patient eligible for the clinical trial.
8.3.[ADDRESS_757069] access to source data and documents
The investigator /institution will allow site trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB /IEC review 
and regulatory  inspections. Direct access must be provided to the CRF and all source 
documents/data, including progress notes, copi[INVESTIGATOR_15587], which 
must be available at all times for review b y the CRA , auditor and regulatory  inspector

Rationale for change Topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969]/phototherap y:  are not expected 
to have an y substantial impact on the core 
symptoms of the GPP disease (ery thema, scaling, 
pustulosis) and therefore wash out requirement was 
removed.
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_577047]: As there is no washout 
for systemic treatment such as cy closporine, 
methotrexate and retinoids, no washout is 
considered to be needed for topi[INVESTIGATOR_577048]. However, as their impact on 
“soft” disease s ymptoms like ery thema and itching 
cannot be ruled out, and therefore they  should be

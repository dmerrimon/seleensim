RC1126     [ADDRESS_367152] cancer, and prostate cancer combined.[ Jemal  et 
al., 2010] Eighty -seven percent of patients with lung cancer will have non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), and the majority of patients will present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. [Yang  et 
al., 2005, Govindan et al. , 2006] Tobacco use accounts for 90% of the cases of lung cancer in men, and 
75-85% of the cases in women. Approximately 10- 15% of cases of lung cancer occur in patients who 
have never smoked in the [LOCATION_002]. [Subramanian et al. , 2007] Given the prevalence of lung cancer 
in the [LOCATION_002] this represents a substantial patient population. Lung cancer in never smokers appears to have a different prognosis and response to therapy.[ Nordquist  et al. , 2004, Dibble  et al. , 
2005, Tsao  et al. , 2006 ] A history of a light or never smoking history is associated with a higher 
response to epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) tyro sine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy (e.g. 
erlotinib or gefitinib), and this patient population has a higher prevalence of activating EGFR mutations.  
[Pao et al. , 2004, Thatcher  et al. , 2005] Other clinical factors associated with a higher prevalence of 
activating EGFR mutations are adenocarci noma histology, Asian ethnicity, and female gender.[ Pao et 
al., 2005, Thatcher  et al. , 2005] The prevalence of these mutations in the overall patient population in 
Europe and the [LOCATION_002] is estimated to be 10 -15%.[ Sequist  et al. , 2007] The prevalence among 
patients with a history of nev er-smoking in Europe or the [LOCATION_002] is estimated to be approximately 
35-40%. [Sequist  et al. , 2007 , Rosell  et al. , 2009] The specific EGFR mutations that are associated with 
response are deletion of exon 19, and an exon [ADDRESS_367153] a better survival with EGFR TKI therapy.  [Jackman  et al. , 2006 , Riely  et al. , 2006 ] 
 
Several single arm phase II trials have investigated the efficacy of EGFR TKI therapy in patients whose tumors have demonstrated the presence of an activating EGFR mutation. [ Asahina et al. , 2006, Sequist  
et al. , 2008, Inoue  et al. , 2009] A phase III non- inferiority trial with the primary end -point of PFS 
investigated the efficacy of single agent gefitinib in comparison to carboplatin and paclitaxel was 
performed in Asia. [ Mok  et al. , 2009] Patients were required to have an adenocarcinoma histology, a 
never or light smoking history (defined as ≤ 10 pack years and quit smoking ≥ 15 years ago), and a performance status of 0 to 2. Treatment with gefitinib demonstrated superiority in PFS compared to 
carboplatin and paclitaxel (HR = 0.74, 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.85; p<0.001). A higher response rate was 
observed among patients who received treatment of the gefitinib arm in comparison to the carboplatin and paclitaxel arm (43% vs. 32.2%, respectively; odds ratio (OR) 1.59 (95% CI, 1.25 to 2.01; p<0.001). 
A lower rate of common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 3 to 4 treatment related adverse events was 
observed of the gefitin ib arm compared to the carboplatin and paclitaxel arm (28.7% versus 61%, 
respectively). A statistically significant higher rate of improvement quality of life (Qol) assessment and symptom reduction was observed among patients on gefitinib arm compared to p atients on carboplatin 
and paclitaxel arm as assessed by [CONTACT_33743] -Lung (FACT-L) and 
Trial Outcome Index (TOI). 
 
Of the 1217 randomized patients 437 (35.9%) had samples analyzed for activating EGFR mutations and the prevalence of mutations in this clinically enriched patient population was 60% (n=261). Of these 
261 samples, 140 (53.6%) had exon 19 deletions, and 111 (42.5%) had a mutation at exon 21. In the 
subset of patients with evidence of an activating EGFR mutation (n=261) patients who received gefitinib experienced a statistically significant improvement in PFS in comparison to patients who 
received carboplatin and paclitaxel (HR=0.48, 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.64; p<0.001; median 9.5 vs. 6.3 
months, respectively). The r esponse rate was significantly higher among patients who received gefitinib 
in comparison to carboplatin and paclitaxel as well (71.2% vs. 47.3%, p<0.001). Conversely among patients without evidence of an activating EGFR mutation (n=176) the patients who r eceived gefitinib 
experienced a statistically significant inferior PFS in comparison to patients who received carboplatin 
and paclitaxel (HR=2.85, 95% CI, 2.05 to 3.98; p<0.001). The response rate was significantly lower 
among patients who received gefitinib in comparison to patients who received carboplatin and paclitaxel 
(1.1% vs. 23.5%, OR=0.04, 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.27; p=0.001); one patient responded to the gefitinib. Not 
enough events have occurred to assess the secondary end -point of OS. 
RC1126     5       Addendum 10 
 
A phase III tri al performed in Japan compared treatment with gefitinib to carboplatin and paclitaxel 
among patients with EGFR mutations and the absence of the resistant EGFR mutation 
T790M.[ Maemondo et al. , 2010] The primary end -point was PFS, and secondary end-points were 
overall survival, response rate and toxicity. After a planned interim analysis the PFS wa s significant 
longer among patients in the gefitinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm resulting in early termination of the study after 200 patients had been enrolled. Patients in the gefitinib arm experienced a 
significantly longer PFS (HR=0.30, 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.41; p<0.001; median 10.8 and 5.4 months, 
respectively), higher response rate (73.7% vs. 30.7%, p<0.001), and lower rate of grade ≥ 3 toxicity 
(41.2 vs. 71.7, p<0.001). The median OS observed in the gefitinib and chemotherapy treatment arms 
were 30.5 and 23.6 months, respectively. A second phase III trial in Japan compared gefitinib to 
cisplatin and docetaxel among patients with an EGFR mutation. [Mitsudomi  et al. , 2010] The primary 
end-point was PFS, and enrollment to this trial was stopped after 177 patients had been enrolled when the results of other trials [Mok et al. , 2009, Maemondo et al. , 2010] had revealed a superior PFS with 
gefitinib among patients with an EGFR mutation were publicly presented. Patients in the gefitinib treatment arm experienced a significantly longer PFS (HR=0.489, 95% CI 0.336 to 0.710; p<0.0001; 
median PFS 9.2 and 6.3 months, respectively), and higher response rate (62.1% vs. 32.2%, 
respectively). Not enough events have occurred to assess the secondary end -point of OS.  
 
A separate study performed in Europe screened patients for an activating EGFR mutation, and identified 
mutations in 16.6% of patients and among 37.7% of patients with history as having never smoked.13 In the 217 patients who received erlotinib the median PFS and OS observed was 14 months (95% CI, 11.3 
to 16.7) and 27.0 months (95% CI, 22.7 to 31.3), respectively. The PFS and OS were similar in patients who received erlotinib as first and second -line therapy. However, poor progressive- free survival was 
associated with the presence of the L858R mutation (HR=1.92; 95% CI, 1.19 to 3.10; p=0.02) as well as OS (HR=2.98 (95% CI, 1.48 to 6.04); p=0.002), and on a multivariate analysis of OS the L858R 
mutation was associated with poor prognosis. A randomized phase III trial compared erlotinib to four 
cycles of carboplatin and gemcitabine in pa tients with an EGFR mutation (n=154); the primary end-
point was PFS. [Zhou et al. , 2011] The PFS was significantly longer among patients in the erlotinib arm 
compared to the chemotherapy arm (HR=0.16, 95% CI, 0.10-0.26; p<0.0001; median PFS 13.1 and 4.6 months, respectively) and the overall response rate was higher as well (83% vs. 36%, p<0.0001). 
Patients assigned to the erlotinib compared to the chemotherapy had a significant improvement in their 
quality of life as assessed by [CONTACT_92349] -L and LCS score (p<0.0001).  A second phase III trial compared 
erlotinib to platinum -based therapy in patients with an EGFR mutation; the primary end- point was PFS. 
[Rosell  et al. , 2011] The patients assigned to the erlotinib a rm compared to the chemotherapy arm 
experienced a significantly longer PFS (HR=0.37, 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.54; p<0.0001); median PFS of 9.7 
and 5.4 months, respectively). The overall response rate in the erlotinib and chemotherapy arm was 58 
and 15%, respectiv ely.  
 
In summary these phase III trials have demonstrated the superiority of EGFR TKI therapy in patients with evidence of activating EGFR mutation, and the inferiority of EGFR TKI therapy as initial therapy 
in patients who do not have evidence of an activating EGFR mutation in comparison to standard 
chemotherapy. The IPASS trial demonstrated that clinical criteria alone (smoking history, histology, and 
ethnicity) cannot be used alone to select for patients who may benefit from first- line therapy with EGFR  
TKI therapy. The median PFS observed with EGFR TKI therapy in patients with an activati ng EGFR 
mutation was 9.2 to 13.1 months on these trials. The current American Society of Clinical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines r ecommend first- line EGFR TKI therapy 
for patients with an EGFR mutation.[ Azzoli  et al. , 2009 , Ettinger  et al. , 2010] 
 
  
RC1126     [ADDRESS_367154] in vestigated chemotherapy alone versus in combination with EGFR 
TKI therapy in unselected patient populations.[ Giaccone et al. , 2004, Herbst  et al. , 2004, Herbst  
et al. , 2005, Gatzemeier et al. , 2007] On a retrospective analysis of patients with a history of 
never smoking (n=72) who received chemotherapy in combination with erl otinib (n=28) had a 
superior survival to patients who received chemotherapy alone (n=44) (HR=0.49, 95% CI 0.28 
to 0.85; median overall survival of 22.5 vs. 10.1 months).[ Herbst  et al. , 2005] These data led to 
the developmen t of Cancer and Leukemia Group (CALGB) trial [ZIP_CODE], a randomized phase II 
trial of erlotinib alone or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with 
adenocarcinoma and a light or never smoking history.[ Janne  et al. , 2010] The primary end -point 
was PFS, and t he trial was not designed to compare the two treatment arms. In the erlotinib 
alone arm (n=81) the PFS and OS observed was 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 8.3) and 24.3 months (95% CI, 18.4 to 31.3), respectively. In the chemotherapy and erlotinib arm the PFS and 
OS observed was 6.6 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 8.2) and 19.6 (95% CI, 14.4 to 28.7), respectively. 
Among patients in the erlotinib arm with an EGFR mutation (n=33) the PFS and OS observed 
were 15.7 months (95% CI, 8.6 to 20.4) and 31.3 months (95% CI, 23.8 to 42.8), respectively. 
Patients with an activating EGFR mutation (n=33) compared to EGFR wild-type (n=44) experienced a statistically significant longer PFS and OS in the erlotinib alone arm. Among 
patients with an activating EGFR mutation (n=33) in the erlotinib with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel arm the PFS and OS observed were 17.2 months (95% CI, 10.3 to not available (NA)) 
and 39.0 (95% CI, 38.1 to NA), respectively. In the erlotinib and chemotherapy treatment arm 
the patients with activating EGFR mutati on (n=33) compared to the EGFR wild-type (n=54) 
experienced a statistically significant longer PFS and OS. Patients in the erlotinib and 
chemotherapy arm experienced a numerically higher rate of hematologic and non -hematologic 
toxicity compared to patients in the erlotinib alone arm.

A single arm phase II trial revealed promising activity of the combination of erlotinib and 
bevacizumab in patients who had progressed after previous chemotherapy. [Herbst  et al. , 2011] 
A phase III trial compared erlotinib alone or in combination with bevacizumab in patients who had progressed on chemotherapy (n=650) with the primary end-point of overall survival. The 
overall survival was not different between the erlotinib and bevacizumab in comparison to 
erlotinib and placebo (HR=0.97, 955 CI, 0.80-1.18; p=0.7583; median OS 9.3 and 9.2 months, respectively). Patients who received erlotinib and bevacizumab in comparison to patients who 
received erlotinib exper ienced a statistically s ignificant higher response (13% vs. 6 %, p=0.006), 
and improved PFS (HR=0.62, 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.75; p<0.0001, median PFS 3.4 and 1.7 months. 
respectively ). In the subset of patients with a history of never smoking (n=67) the combination 
therapy demonstrated a statistically significantly superior PFS (HR=0.39 (95% CI, 020 to 0.74: 
p=0.0295) and OS (HR=0.44, 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.94; p=0.0295). Of the 636 patients enrolled 
tumor samples were available on 477 patients. In a subset analysis of patients with activating 
EGFR mutation (n=30) the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab (n=12) demonstrated a 
numerically superior PFS in comparison to erlotinib and placebo (n=18); HR=0.52, 95% CI, 
0.19 to 1.38); median PFS of 17.1 months vs. 9.7 months).[ Herbst  et al. , 2009 ] The overall 
survival observed in the erlotinib and bevacizumab was numerically superior to erlotinib and placebo (HR=0.44, 95% CI, 0.11 to 1.67; median survival time  not reached and 20.2 months, respectively). [Herbst  et al. , 2011]. 
 A phase II trial investigated erlotinib compared to erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients with an 
EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutations [Seto et al 2014]. The primary end-point 
was PFS by [CONTACT_300820] 154 patients wer e enrolled. Patients assigned 
to the erlotinib and bevacizumab compared to the erlotinib alone arm experienced a statistically 
significant difference in PFS (HR of 0.54, 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.79; p=0.0015: median 16.0 and 9.7 
months).  In a subset analysis, patients with exon 19 deletion mutations (n=80) who received 
erlotinib and bevacizumab compared to erlotinib alone experienced statistically significant 
longer PFS (HR of 0.41, 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.72; p=0.0011; median PFS of 18.0 and 10.3 months, respectively) . In a subset analysis patients exon 21 L858R mutations (n=72) who received 
erlotinib and bevacizumab compared to erlotinib experienced a numerically longer PFS (HR of 0.67, 95% CI< 0.38 to 1.18; p=0.[ZIP_CODE]; median PFS of 13.9 and 7.1 months, respectively). The 
most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events in the erlotinib/bevacizumab and erlotinib arms were 
rash (25% vs. 19%), hypertension (60% vs. 10%), and proteinuria (8% vs.0%).  
At the time the trial was written treatment an ti-coagulation was a relative contraindication for 
treatment with bevacizumab. Since the initiation of the trial additional data has revealed that the treatment of patients on anticoagulation do not experience an increased risk of severe bleeding 
events.  
[Leigh l et al 2011] Importantly, no epi[INVESTIGATOR_300787]. Several recently completed trials of 
bevacizumab in advanced NSCLC have allowed patients on therapeutic anticoagulation to be 
enrolled or rem ain on trial if full dose anticoagulation is required. [Reck et al 2009] Additional 
safety data is available from the phase IV Safety of Avastin in Lung cancer study (SAiL) of 2,212 patients which did not reveal an increased risk of bleeding events with concomitant use of 
bevacizumab  and anticoagulation.  [Crino et al 2010]. The current Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group trial which is investigating bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel allows for full dose anti- coagulation ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Thus, we are amending the 
trial to allow full dose anti-coagulation. 
 
  
RC1126     8       Addendum 10 
The management of patients with brain metastases receiving bevacizumab has changed since 
the time the protocol was written. The original protocol was based on a phase II trial the 
eligibility criteria were based on bevacizumab starting 4 weeks after completion of radiation 
therapy to brain metastases. [Socinski  et al. , 2009 ] A prospective phase II trial demonstrated the 
safet y of using bevacizumab with first- line chemotherapy or second -line erlotinib in patients 
with asymptomatic untreated brain metastases. [Besse et al. , 2013 ] In addition to the data f rom 
treatment of patients with NSCLC and brain metastases there are data several phase III trials have investigated the role of bevacizumab in the treatment of glioblastoma. A phase III trial 
initiated bevacizumab week 4 of a 6 week course of radiotherapy in combination with 
temozolomide.[ Gilbert  et al. , 2014] A second phase III trial in glioblastoma initiated 
bevacizumab concurrently with temozolomide and radiation, and continued bevacizumab after 
completion of radiation therapy. [Chinot  et al. , 2014] In order to be consistent with literature and 
other trials investigating bevacizumab (e.g. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 5508, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) we have amended the trial so that patients with treated brain metastases would 
be eligible if ≥ [ADDRESS_367156] been identified; secondary mutations in EGFR itself (EGFR T790M) or amplification of the MET oncogene. [Kobayashi  et al. , 2005, Pao  et al. , 2005, Shih et al. , 2005, 
Kosaka  et al. , 2006, Bean  et al. , 2007, Engelman  et al. , 2007] In addition, a recent study 
suggested that EGFR T790M may pre -exist in EGFR mutant caners prior to gefitinib or 
erlotinib treatment [ Maheswaran  et al. , 2008]. Those patients in whom a pre- treatment EGFR 
T790M was detected (n=10) had a shorter time to disease progression than patients without detectable EGFR T790M (N=16), 7.7 months and 16.5 months (p<0.001).[ Maheswaran  et al. , 
2008] The detection of the T790M can be difficult because of allelic dilution due to the fact that the EGFR gene is amplified but only a few copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] T790M allele are needed to confer 
resistance which may obscure results with conventional sequencing meth ods.[ Janne, 2008 ] 
 
As resistance occurs in all patients, it is critical to identify effective treatments for EGFR mutant NSCLC patients that may overcome acquired resistance or prevent or delay the emergence of 
acquired resistance. Unfortunately, repeat biopsies to detect the mechanisms of EGFR TKI 
resistance frequently are not feasible and/or  associated with risk to the patient which may be 
difficult to justify given the poor prognosis associated with advanced stage NSCLC. The issue 
is further complicated by [CONTACT_300821].  
 
The tumor specimens from this trial will provide a valuable resource in which to perform 
correlative studies on EGFR mutations. These include the ability to correlate plasma detected EGFR mutations with tumor EGFR mutations and to study the pre- existence of erlotinib 
resistance mechanisms. This trial can prospectively assess whether patients with pre- existing 
EGFR T790M mutations have a shorter TTP with erlotinib (or erlotinib/bevacizumab) treatment. If so, such findings would have significant future therapeu tic implications including 
the use of second generation irreversible EGFR inhibitors as initial therapy

Academic and Community Cancer Research United (ACCRU ) Registration Office at 
 the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Central Time (Monday through 
Friday).  
 
T
he instructions for the registration/randomization application are available by [CONTACT_300823].  Prior to initiation of protocol study intervention, this process must be completed in its entirety and a ACCRU subject ID number must be available as noted in the 
instructions.  It is the responsibility of the individual and  institution registering the patient to 
confirm the process has been successfully completed prior to release of the study agent.  Patient registration via the registration/randomization application can be confirmed in any 
of the following ways:  
 
• Contact [CONTACT_300824], the ACCRU  Registration Office staff can access the information from 
the centralized database and confirm the registration. 
• Refer to “Instructions for Remote Registration” in section “Finding/Displaying 
Information about A Registered Subject.” 
 
6.12 Correlative Research

analgesics, and/or antiemetics received from the first day of study treatment administration until 30 days after the final dose will be recorded in the medical records.  
 
9.4 Diarrhea: This could be managed conservatively with loperamide. The recommended dose of 
loperamide is [ADDRESS_367193] onset, followed by 2 mg every 2-4 hours until diarrhea free 
(maximum 16 mg/day). 
 
In the event of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed: hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals.   
 
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydration) and/or associated with fever or severe neutropenia (grade 3 or 4), broad- spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed. Patients with severe 
diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting should be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_300788]. 
 
9.5 Hypertension is a known and potentially serious adverse event associated with bevacizumab 
treatment. An increase in blood pr essure of >20 mmHg (systolic) and 10 mmHg (diastolic) 
should be reported to the treating physician immediately (see Section 8.0 for hypertension management and dose reduction guidelines).

RC1126 33 Addendum 10 
9.8 Management of erlotinib -associated adverse events  
 
9.81 Rash : Patients should be informed that skin toxicity is to be expected during treatment 
with erlotinib.  Rash was the most commonly reported adverse event considered related 
to erlotinib therapy in phase III trials. Rash typi[INVESTIGATOR_300791] 8 to 10 days of 
initiation of treatment but may appear within 1 to 113 days. Although the rash is commonly referred to as “acnei form”, it is not acne, but rather a papulopustular 
reaction, and should not be treated as acne. Patients are recommended to wear sun screen protection, hat, long sleeves to avoid sun as it can exacerbate skin rash.  
 
Redness and/or a warm sensation of the skin can be an initial indicator in the development of erlotinib-related rash. Tender skin and inflammatory pustules and 
papules begin to appear on the face, head, and upper torso as the rash develops, and the 
rash is typi[INVESTIGATOR_300792], dry skin, and erythema. Most incidences of 
rash are intermittent and mild to moderate in severity. When accurately managed, rash 
and other e rlotinib -related skin toxicities generally do not interfere with a patient’s 
treatment; however, a small proportion of patients may experience a severe rash that could lead to significant physical and/or cosmetic discomfort and may require discontinuation of therapy at the patient’s request. 
 
In addition to rash, other e rlotinib -related skin toxicities include dry, itchy, or flaky skin 
(especially on the scalp); increased growth of facial hair (including eyelashes/brows); small skin fissures on the fingertips; brittle and/or loose fingernails; sores around the eyes, corners of the mouth, or inside the nose; easily bruised skin; dry, itchy eyes; 
inflammation around the nails (especially thumbs and big toes) sometimes accompanied 
by [CONTACT_77368]; and decreased hair growth and/or hair loss on the legs, arm, and scalp. 
 
Prophylactic treatment of the skin may prevent or reduce skin toxicity. Patients should avoid soap as it is drying and use bath oil with tepid water when bathing. The patient 
should be encouraged to use an alcohol- free, emollient cream applied twice a day to the 
entire body as soon as the patient starts therapy with erlotinib. Creams and ointments 
are recommended because they have a greater ability to retain moisture than lotions.  
Examples of suitable emollient creams include: Neutrogena
® Norwegian formula, 
SARNA® Ultra, Vanicream™, Aveeno® (fragrance- free formulation), a nd Eucerin® 
cream. Other over-the- counter aqueous creams or emulsifying ointments may also 
provide symptomatic benefit. Lotions should be avoided because they often contain 
alcohol, which will dry the skin. Patients should also be encouraged to use a titan ium 
dioxide or zinc oxide-based sunscreen product applied to sun- exposed areas twice per 
day. 
 
Patients who develop skin toxicity and are symptomatic should be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_300793]. If needed, oral minocycline 
or oral doxycycline may be combined with the topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588]. A topi[INVESTIGATOR_13372]. For more severe rash, oral 
corticosteroids may be beneficial. Patients who fail to respond to these measures may have the dose of e rlotinib interrupted or reduced.  See Appendix II for more information 
on skin toxicity management. 
 
Minocycline is known to interfere with anticoagulants and oral contraceptives. Patients treated with minocycline who are taking anticoagulants and/or oral contraceptives should be monitored accordingly. 
 
  
RC1126 34 Addendum 10 
9.82 Diarrhea: previous trials have shown that the frequency of severity of diarrhea rarely 
hindered administration of erlotinib and could be managed conservatively with 
loperamide. The recommended dose of loperamide is [ADDRESS_367194] onset, followed 
by 2 mg every 2 -4 hours (4 mg every four hours can be given at night) until diarrhea 
free for 12 hours.  
 
9.83 Keratitis : Preservative- free artificial tears, ointments, and/or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_40785], with a follow-up examination within 2 weeks. Any sympt oms of keratitis 
(corneal inflammation/corneal ulceration) should prompt an ophthalmologic evaluation

CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_367195] access to a copy of the 
CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy o f the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP

10.[ADDRESS_367196], 
identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. Next, 
determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2) and if the 
adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.3). With 
this information, determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report 
(see Section 10.4). Important : Expedited adverse event reporting requires submission of 
a Med Wa tch report(s). Expedited reports are to be completed within the timeframes 
and via the mechanisms specified in Section  10.4. All AEs reported via expedited 
mechanisms must also be reported via the routine data reporting mechanisms defined by 
[CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.5 and 18.0). 
 
10.[ADDRESS_367197] Level Term (LLT).  
 
• NOTE: A severe AE, as defined by [CONTACT_15928], is NOT  the same as 
serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
 
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
 
• The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on agent- specific 
information pr ovided in Section 15.0 of the protocol.  
• Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent -specific information provided in 
Section 15.0 of the protocol. 
 
NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience that is neither 
identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information provided for IRB review 
nor mentioned in the consent form.  
   
RC1126 35 Addendum 10 
10.3 Assessment of Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the 
following attribution categories are utilized:  
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s).  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s).  
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). Unlikely - The adverse event  is doubtfully related to the agent(s).  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical 
treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relatio nship between the 
drug and the adverse event.

10.312  Death  
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_367200] dose, regardless of 
attribution to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires 
expedited reporting within 24 -hours.  
• Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE  requires expedited reporting within 24 -hours. 
 
• Reportable categories of Death  
• Death at tributable to a CTCAE term.  
• Death Neonatal:  A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_31948] 28 days of life.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5.  
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 
5 “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl 
cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the 
system organ class (SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the 
death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., 
radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progress ion: 
clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should 
be submitted. 
 
10.313  Secondary Malignancy 
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, 
radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an IND/IDE to be reported. Three options are available to describe the event:  
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute 
Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML])  
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
o Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including 
AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms 
outlined in each protocol.  
 
10.314  Second Malignancy  
• A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy 
(and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting.

11.[ADDRESS_367205] Guideline  
 
NOTE: This study uses protocol RECIST v1.1 template dated 2/16/2011.  See the footnote for the table 
regarding measureable disease in Section 11.44, as it pertains to data collection and analysis.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed 
by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1) 
(Eisenhauer et al 2009 ). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measuremen t) of the tumor 
lesions and the short axis measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST guideline. 
 
11.1 Schedule of Evaluations: For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated every [ADDRESS_367206] diameter can be 
accurately measured as ≥ 2.[ADDRESS_367207] x- ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_367208] component of a PET/CT, or MRI.  
 11.[ADDRESS_367209] d iameter is ≥ 1.0 cm 
in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules) or imaging. In the case of skin l esions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   
RC1126 41 Addendum 10 
11.213 A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis is >1.[ADDRESS_367210] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no 
greater than 5 mm).   
 
NOTE:  Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated area are not considered 
measurable disease.   
 
11.22 Non-Measurable Disease  
 
11.221 All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non- measurable disease, 
including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 to <1.5 cm). Bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusio ns, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable as 
well.  
 
Note: ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for 
selection as target lesions.  In addition, lymph nodes that have a short axis <1.0 cm are considered non- pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be recorded or followed. 
 11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
11.31 Measurement Methods:   
 
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal fractions of 
centimeters) using  a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. For patients 
having only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_367211]- treatment tumor assessments.   
• Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_300829] a treatment.   
 
11.32 Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease:  
 
• Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_367212] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
• As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of 
disease. The lesions sh ould be measured on the same pulse sequence. Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be 
followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with 
breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
• PET-CT: If the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT is of 
identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used  
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  
RC1126 42 Addendum 10 
• Chest X -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT scans are 
preferable.  
• Physical Examination: For superficial non -nodal lesions, physical examination is 
acceptable, but imaging is preferable, if both can be done. In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the 
lesion, is recommended. 
• FDG -PET: FDG -PET scanning is allowed to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progressive disease [PD] and particularly possible 'new' disease. A 
‘positive’ FDG- PET scanned lesion is defined as one which is FDG avid with an 
update gr eater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected 
image; otherwise, an FDG -PET scanned lesion is considered ‘negative.’ New lesions 
on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be identified accord ing to the following 
algorithm: 
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline with a positive FDG -PET at follow-up is a sign 
of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: 
 
i. If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease 
confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  
ii. If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT at the same evaluation, additional follow-up CT scans (i.e., additional follow -up scans at least 4 weeks later) are needed to determine if 
there is truly progression occurring at that site. In this situation, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal PDG -PET scan.  
iii If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, it is not classified as PD.  
 
11.33 Measurement at Follow -up Evaluation: 
 
• In the case of stable disease (SD), follow -up measurements must have met the SD 
criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks (see Section 
11.44). 
• The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response 
or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
• Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR 
in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where 
known residual benign tumors can remain.) 
 
11.[ADDRESS_367213]  
 
11.41 Target Lesions & Target Lymph Nodes 
 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21) up to a maximum of 5 lesions, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as “T arget L esions ” and 
recorded and measured at baseline. These lesions can be non -nodal or nodal (as 
defined in 11. 21), where no more than 2 lesions are from the same organ and no 
more than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected.  
 
RC1126 43 Addendum 10 
Note:  If fewer than 5  target lesion s and target lymph nodes are identified (as there 
often will be), there is no reason to perform additional studies beyond those specified 
in the protocol to discover new lesions. 
 
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis of their size, 
be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) does not lend itself to 
reproducible measurements in which circumstance the next largest lesion (or 
malignant lymph node) which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.   
 
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD): A sum of the longest diameter for all target 
lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be calculated 
and reported as the basel ine sum of dimensions (BSD). The BSD will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor response in the measurable dimension of the disease.   
 
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD): A sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesi ons plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be 
calculated and reported as the post- baseline sum of dimensions (PBSD). If the 
radiologist is able to provide an actual measure for the target  lesion  (or target lymph 
node) , that shoul d be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm. If the target lesion (or 
target lymph node) is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
measure, a default value of 0.[ADDRESS_367214] that the ta rget lesion or target lymph node  has likely disappeared, the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 cm. 
 
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD) is the minimum of the BSD and the PBSD.  
 11.42 Non-Target Lesions & Non -Target Lymph Nodes 
 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non - target lesions or 
non-target lymph nodes and should also be recorded at baseline. These lesions and 
lymph nodes should be followed in accord with 11.433. 
 11.[ADDRESS_367215]/MRI/PET -
CT/Chest X -ray/physical examination must be measured on re- evaluation at 
evaluation times specified in Section 11.1. Specifically, a change in objective status to either a PR or CR cannot be done without re- measuring target 
lesions and target lymph nodes.  
 
Note: Non -target lesions and non -target lymph nodes should be evaluated at 
each assessment, especially in the case of first response or confirmation of response. In selected circumstances, certain non -target organs may be 
evaluated less frequently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeated 
only when complete response is identified in target disease or when 
progression in bone is suspected.  
 
  
RC1126 44 Addendum 10 
11.432 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):  All of the following must be true:  
 
a. Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction 
in short axis to <1.0 cm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the 
sum of the short axis of all the target lymph 
nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference 
the BSD ( see Section 11.41).  
 
Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be true: 
 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which 
also includes any lymph node that was 
normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) and 
increased to ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_367216] a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the 
longest diameter for all target lesions plus 
the sum of the short axis of all the target 
lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as 
reference the MSD (Section 11.41).  In addition, the PBSD must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm from the 
MSD.  
 c. See Section 11.32 for details in regards to 
the requirements for PD via  FDG -PET 
imaging.  
  
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the MSD.

Complete Response (CR):  All of the following must be true: 
 
 
a. Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 b. Each non-target lymph node must have a 
reduction in short axis to <1.0 cm. 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesions or 
non-target lymph nodes. 
 
  
RC1126 45 Addendum 10 
Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be true: 
 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which 
also includes any lymph node that was 
normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) and 
increased to ≥ 1.0 cm short axis during  follow-up.   
 b. Unequivocal progression of existing non-
target lesions and non -target lymph nodes.  
(NOTE:  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion and target 
lymph node status.  It must be representative 
of overall disease status change.)  
 c. See Section  11.32 for details in regards to 
the requirements for PD via FDG -PET 
imaging.

11.45 Symptomatic Deterioration: Patients with global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that 
time, and not either related to study treatment or other medical condi tions, should be 
reported as PD due to “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to symptomatic deterioration. A patient is classified as having PD due to “sym ptomatic 
deterioration” if any of the following occur that are not either related to study treatment or other medical conditions: 
• Weight loss >10% of body weight. 
• Worsening of tumor- related symptoms.  
• Decline in performance status of >1 level on ECOG scale.

13.0 Treatment/Follow –up Decision at Evaluation of Patient   
 
13.1 Patients who are CR, PR, or SD will continue treatment per protocol. 
 
13.2 Patients who develop PD while receiving therapy will go to the event-monitoring phase. 
Complete the Event Monitoring Form at the time of PD.  Patient will then be observed 21 -42 
days following discontinuation of treatment and will then go to event monitoring (see Section 18.0). 
 13.3 Patient s will continue treatment until PD, unacceptable toxicity, investigator’s decision remove 
patient from the study, patient refusal to continue, or alternate treatment. Treatment will then be 
discontinued. Patients will be observed 21-42 days following discontinuation of treatment and 
will then go to event monitoring (see Section 18.0). 
 13.4 Patients who go off protocol treatment for reasons other than PD will go to observation per 
Section 4.0 (day 21- 42 days after treatment disco ntinuation), and then to the event -monitoring 
phase per Section 18.0.  
 
13.5 Patients who develop PD in the CNS  only should receive appropriate treatment for brain 
metastases and should be considered as having progressive disease.  
 
13.6 Patients who develop non- CNS  PD at any time should go to event monitoring. Complete the 
Event Monitoring Form at the time of PD. Patient will then be observed 21-42 days following 
discontinuation of treatment and will then go to event monitoring (see Section 18.0). These 
patients should be treated with alternative chemotherapy if their clinical status is good enough 
to allow further therapy.   
 
13.[ADDRESS_367219] an ongoing bevacizumab- related Grade 4 or serious adverse event at the time 
of discontinuation from study treatment will continue to be followed until resolution of the

14.4 Study Methodology and Storage Information 
 
14.41 Blood/blood product samples will be collected for the following research  
Plasma EGFR detection : There has been great interest in developi[INVESTIGATOR_55765] -invasive 
methods for EGFR  genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. This would provide a means of non- invasively 
evaluating whether a patient’s tumor harbors an EGFR mutation if such information 
cannot be obtained from their diagnostic tumor biopsy. In addition such a method would have the ability to query any changes in EGFR mutations over time and in response to tr eatment. Most studies have found a concordance of ~70% with the tumor 
EGFR mutation.[
Bai et al. , 2009, Kuang  et al. , 2009, Rosell  et al. , 2009 ] However, very 
few if any studies have performed such analyses prospectively and from treatment naïve 
advanced NSCLC pa tients that are undergoing treatment with EGFR inhibitors. 
Furthermore, the ability to detect mutations non- invasively will likely increase over 
time with the advent of new and novel technology. As patients need to have a known EGFR mutation at study entry, the current trial provides an ideal study in which to 
query the correlation of plasma and tumor EGFR mutations. The correlation with the 
EGFR activating mutation will be performed from the baseline (pre -treatment 
specimen) as all patients will be treatment naïve. 
 
EGFR T790M:  EGFR T790M is the common mechanism of drug resistance to erlotinib 
and is detected in up to 60% of EGFR mutant NSCLC patients that develop acquired resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors including erlotinib. [
Kobayashi  et al. , 2005, Pao et 
al., 2005, Oxnard et al. , 2011]  In addition to being a drug resistance mutation, this 
mutation is associated with a unique biology. Prior studies have demonstrated that patients that develop this mechanism of drug resistance appear to have more indolent 
disease and a better overa ll survival. [Oxnard  et al. , 2011 ] The evolution of this 
mutation during the course of erlotinib therapy has not been prospectively assessed from patients undergoing therapy. It will be interesting to determine at which point 
during the course of a patient’ s treatment can EGFR  T790M be detected from plasma 
DNA and the relationship to clinical progression as defined by [CONTACT_13407]. EGFR 
T790M will be assayed from plasma DNA at baselin e and during each radiographic 
assessment and at the time of progression.

Investigator brochur es: Investigator brochures for both agents  are available on the ACCRU web site 
under study RC1126. 
 
15.1 Bevacizumab (Avastin )  
 
15.11 Background : Bevacizumab is classified as an Anti -VEGF Monoclonal Antibody and a 
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)  Inhibitor. Bevacizumab is a recombinant, 
humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody which binds to, and 
neutralizes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), preventing its association with 
endothelial receptors, Flt -[ADDRESS_367227]. VEGF binding i nitiates angiogenesis (endothelial 
proliferation and the formation of new blood vessels). The inhibition of microvascular 
growth is believed to retard the growth of all tissues (including metastatic tissue).  
 
15.12 Formulation : Bevacizumab is manufactured  by [CONTACT_12060], using a 
genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The protein is purified 
from the cell culture medium by [CONTACT_300835]. The final product is tested for quality, identity, safety, purity, potency, 
strength, and excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]/chemical composition according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. The purity of bevacizumab is > 95%. 
 
  
RC1126 51 Addendum 10 
Bevacizumab is supplied in 100 mg (4 mL) and 400 mg (16 mL) glas s vials, each with a 
concentration of 25 mg/mL. Vials contain bevacizumab with phosphate, trehalose, 
polysorbate 20, and sterile water for injection (SWFI), USP. Vials contain no 
preservative and are suitable for single use only.  
 15.13 Preparation and sto rage : Bevacizumab vials should be stored in a refrigerator at 2°C -
8°C. Keep vial in the outer carton due to light sensitivity. DO NOT FREEZE. DO 
NOT SHAKE.  
 
Chemical and physical in -use stability has been demonstrated for 48 hours at 2°C -30°C 
in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Do not administer or mix with dextrose solution.  
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not 
used immediately, in -use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user 
and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
 
Withdraw the necessary amount of bevacizumab and dilute to the required 
administration volume with 0.9% sodium chloride solu tion. The concentration of the 
final bevacizumab solution should be kept within the range of 1.4 - 16.5 mg/mL. 
Discard any unused portion left in a vial, as the product contains no preservatives. 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for pa rticulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration.  
 15.14  Administration:  Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Administer only as 
an intravenous (IV) infusion. Do not initiate bevacizumab for [ADDRESS_367228] infusion: Administer infusion over 90 minutes. Subsequent infusions: Administer 
second infusion over [ADDRESS_367229] infusion is tolerated; administer all subsequent 
infusions over 30 minutes if infusion over 60 minutes is tolerated.  
 
15.15 Phar macokinetic information : 
Distribution : V
d: 3.28 L  
Half -life elimination: 3-4 weeks 
Clearance: 0.22 L/day. A low serum albumin and high tumor burden increase 
clearance by 30% and 7% respectively.  Clearance increases with increasing 
body weight, and is 15% slower in women than men. 
Time to steady state : 100 days  
 15.16 Potential Drug Interactions:   
No clnically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction of co -administered chemotherapy on 
bevacizumab pharmacokinetics has been observed based on the results of a po pulation 
PK analysis. There was neither statistical significance nor clinically relevant difference 
in clearance of bevacizumab in patients receiving bevacizumab monotherapy compared 
with patients receiving bevacizumab in combincation with Interferon alpha 2a or other 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (IFL, 5- FU/LV, carboplatin/paclitaxel, capecitabine, doxorubicin or 
cisplatin/gemcitabine).   
RC1126 52 Addendum 10 
No clinically relevant interactions of bevazizumab was observed on the 
pharmacokinetics of co -administered interferon alpha 2a, erlotinib (and its active 
metabolite OSI -420), or the chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_300801] (and its active metabolite 
SN38), capecitabine, oxaliplatin (as determined by [CONTACT_300836]), and cisplatin. Conclusions on the impact of bevacizumab on 
gemcitabine pharmacokinetics cannot be drawn.  
 
Combination of bevacizumab and sunitinib malate: In two clinical studies of 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma, microangiopathic hemolytic  anemia (MAHA) 
was reported in 7 of 19 patients treated with bevacizumab  (10 mg/kg every two 
weeks) and sunitinib malate (50 mg daily) combination. MAHA is a hemolytic disorder which can present with red cell fragmentation, anemia,  and 
thrombocytopenia. In addition, hypertension (including hypertensive crisis), elevated creatinine, and neurological symptoms were observed in some of these 
patients. All of these findings were reversible upon discontinuation of 
bevacizumab and  sunitinib malate .

15.2 Erlotinib (OSI -774, Tarceva ) 
 
15.21 Background : Epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) is expressed on the cell surface 
of both normal and cancer cells. In some tumor cells signaling through this receptor 
plays a role in tumor cell survival and proliferation irrespective of EGFR mutation 
status. Erlotinib reversibly  inhibits the kinase activity of EGFR, preventing 
autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues associated with the receptor and thereby  
[CONTACT_300837]. Erlotinib b inding affinity for EGFR exon 19 
deletion or exon 21 L858R mutations is higher than its affinity for the wild type 
receptor. Erlotinib inhibition of other tyrosine kinase receptors has not been fully characterized.  
 
15.22 Formulation : Erlotinib is curr ently formulated as conventional, immediate- release 
tablets in 25 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg strengths. The tablets are film -coated , round, 
white, and bi -convex. The tablets contain lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline 
cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, sodi um lauryl sulfate, hypromellose, hydroxypropyl 
cellulose, titanium dioxide, and magnesium stearate as inactive ingredients. The film 
coating includes Opadry® White. Erlotinib tablets are supplied for clinical trials in 
either bottles or blister packs.  
 
15.23 Preparation and storage : Erlotinib tablets should be stored at 25° C (77°F), with 
excursions permitted to 15° -30° C (59° -86°F).  
 
15.24  Administration:  Erlotinib should be taken orally once daily in the morning with water 
at least one hour before or two hours after the ingestion of food . Missed doses should 
not be made up. Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while taking erlotinib. Patients should report any change in smoking status while taking erlotinib.  
 15.25 Pharmacokinetic i nformation : 
a) Absorption – The bioavailability of erlotinib following a single oral Food may 
increase bioavailability.  
b) Distribution – Erlotinib is highly protein bound (92 to 95%) in humans. 
c) Metabolism – Erlotinib is metabolized in humans in the liver by [CONTACT_300838] (primarily CYP3A4  and CYP3A5, and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 ), 
and the pulmonary isoform CYP1A1. 
d) Excretion – Erlotinib and its metabolites are  excreted  predominately via the feces 
(> 90%), with a small amount recovere d in urine.  
 
15.26 Potential Drug Interactions:  
A potential for drug -drug interaction exists when erlotinib is co- administered with 
drugs that are highly protein bound (92% to 95%)  or that are potent CYP3A4  
  
 
 
 
RC1126 56 Addendum 10 
inhibitors/inducers. Potent inducers of CYP3A4 ac tivity (eg. rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513]) increase 
erlotinib metabolism and significantly decrease erlotinib plasma concentrations, while 
potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole) result in increased exposure to erlotinib. It 
has also been  shown that co -administration of erlotinib with proton pump inhibitors 
(e.g., omeprazole) decreases the bioavailability of erlotinib and hence the exposure to erlotinib and its  metabolites.  Co- administration of drugs reducing gastric acid 
production with erlotinib should be avoided where  possible. If patients need to be 
treated with such drugs, then an H2- receptor antagonist such as ranitidine should be 
considered and used in a staggered manner.  Erlotinib  must be taken at  least [ADDRESS_367233] dosing. Erlotinib exposure was 
moderately increased when coadministered with  ciprofloxacin, a CYP3A4 and 
CYP 1A2 inhibitor.  
 
The combination of erlotinib and a statin may increase the potial for statin-induced 
myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, which was observed rarely. 
 
Cigarette smoking (a moderate CYP1A2 inducer) has been shown to reduce erlotinib 
exposure by 50% to 60% (Studies OSI-774-103 and OSI-774-107). Smokers should be 
advised to stop smoking. Concomitant use of Tarceva with moderate CYP1A2 inducers 
should be avoided.  
Interaction with coumarin-derived anticoagulants, including warfarin, leading to 
increased INR and bleeding events, which in some cases were fatal, have been reported 
in patients receiving erlotinib. Patients taking coumarin -derive d anticoagulants should 
be monitored regulatrly for any changes in prothrombin time or INR.  
 15.27 Known potential toxicities :  
Adverse Drug Reactions to be Considered Expected in Erlotinib- treated Patients are the 
following: Eye Disorders:   Keratitis, ulcerative keratitis, corneal perforation, dry eye, uveitis, 
growth of eyelashes, and conjunctivitis.  Gastrointestinal Disorders:   Abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage,

16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
 
16.1 Study Design  
 
The goal of this randomized phase II trial is to compare the efficacy of erlotinib / bevacizumab 
(arm B) to erlot inib alone (arm A) in untreated advanced non- small cell lung cancer patients 
who have activating EGFR mutations, for the purpose of screening whether the combination regimen (arm B) is worthy of further investigation. Since this phase II trial is not a confirmatory study to compare survival benefits between the two treatment regimens, we use a slightly 
inflated Type I error to calculate sample size. The primary endpoint is the progression free 
survival (PFS), which is the time from the date of randomization of eligible patients with 
activating EGFR mutations to the date of disease progression or death of any cause, whichever comes first.  
 
For untreated advanced NSCLC patients, the prevalence rate for EGFR mutants are about 15%. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be screened for EGFR mutation; a total of 112 eligible 
patients with EGFR mutations will be randomized with 1:1 allocation  to arm A and arm B. 
Randomization will be done using the Pocock and Simon dynamic allocation procedure  with 
stratification on gender (male vs. female), and mutation type (exon 19 deletion vs. exon 21 
L858R).   
As of Addendum 5, the study size was amended to randomize 86 eligible patients with 1:1 
allocation to Arm A and Arm B.  
 
16.2 Sample Size, Accrual Time and Study Duration  
RC1126 59 Addendum 10 
  
A total of 118 patients with EGFR mutants are expected to register to the study. Taking 5% 
these patients early withdraw before randomization, a total of [ADDRESS_367237] line trials of EGFR TKI therapy in p atients with evidence 
of an activating EGFR mutation, the median PFS for erlotinib only is approximately 13 
months.[ Rosell  et al. , 2009 ] Investigators look for a 5.6 -month increase (43%) in median PFS, 
or a median PFS of 18.6 months for erlotinib/bevacizumab. The following assumptions are 
made while determining the statistical power: (i) the median PFS is 13 months for patients on 
erlotinib only (arm A) and 18.6 months for erlotinib/bevacizumab (arm B), a 43% increase in 
median PFS and a hazard ratio λ
B/λA = 0.70 under constant hazards; (ii) 112 eligible patients (56 
per arm) with EGFR mutations will be randomized with 1:1 allocation; (iii)  an accrual period of 
56 months (4.7 years); and (iv) an additional follow -up of [ADDRESS_367238] at a one -sided significance level of 0.20, the study 
has approximately 80% power to reject  the null hypothesis λ B/λA = 1 and accept the alternative 
hypothesis λ B/λA < 1 when the true λ B/λA = 0.70. At the time of analysis, or approximately 5.[ADDRESS_367239] enrollment, a total of 88 events (47 on arm A and 41 on arm B) are anticipated under the alternative hypothesis.  
 
As of March [ADDRESS_367240] been randomized. Based on the positive results 
from Seto et al (2014), we amended the sample size of this trial by [CONTACT_300839] 
λ
B/λA from 0.70 in the original design  to 0.667. In particular, we assume that (i) the median PFS 
is 10 months for patients on erlotinib only (arm A) and 15 months for erlotinib/bevacizumab 
(arm B), a 60 % increase in median PFS and a hazard ratio λ B/λA = 0.667 under constant hazards; 
(ii) 86 eligible patients ( 43 per arm) with EGFR mutations will be randomized with 1:1 
allocation; (iii) an accrual period of 43 months ( 3.6 years); and (iv) an additional follow -up of 
[ADDRESS_367241] at a one -sided 
significance level of 0. 20, the study has approximately 81% power to reject the null hypothesis 
λB/λA = 1 and accept the alternative hypothesis λ B/λA < 1 when the true λ B/λA = 0.667. At the 
time of anal ysis, or approximately 4.[ADDRESS_367242] enrollment, a total of 69 events ( 37 on 
arm A and 32 on arm B) are anticipated under the alternative hypothesis.  
 
The time of analysis (after first patient enrolled), at which 69 events occur, is estimated to be 53 
months (95% CI=47- 55 months). The analysis will be conducted when [ADDRESS_367243] occurred.  
The power of the study design under this timing criterion is approximately 79%. 
 
16.3 Primary Endpoint and Analysis 
 
The primary endpoint is progression- free survival (PFS). The primary hypothesis is that 
erlotinib / bevacizumab (arm B) will improve PFS relative to erlotinib alone (arm A) in untreated advanced non- small cell lung cancer patients who have activating EGFR mutations . 
The relative efficacy in term of PFS in favor of erlotinib / bevacizumab  warrants further 
investigator of the experimental regimen in a future phase III trial. The primary analysis will include all randomized patients, regardless of the treatment received. Progression free survival 
(PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression and death of any cause, 
whichever comes first. The primary analysis will be carried out after [ADDRESS_367244] lim it estimator [Kaplan  et al. , 1958] will be used to 
graphically describe progression free survival for patients randomized to each treatment arm. 
From these product limit estimates, median survival and 12 -month progression free survival rate 
and their 95% confidence intervals by [CONTACT_300840]. Comparisons of PFS between arms will be conducted using a stratified log rank te st.[Mantel, 1966]. The association  
of baseline prognostic factors  with PFS, such as
 performance status, gender and mutation type, 
RC1126 60 Addendum 10 
will be evaluated  one by [CONTACT_300841]. Cox proportional hazards model[ Cox, 1972 ] 
will be used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of arm B 
relative arm A with adjusting for significant baseline prognostic factors . Interactions between 
treatment and  the significant prognostic factor s will be tested in a  Cox  proportional hazards 
model with treatment, prognostic factors and the interaction terms as possible predictors. 
Hazard ratio for treatment effect will be estimated for each subgroup of patients that has significant interaction with treatment. The robustne ss of treatment effects in different patient 
subgroups will examined in Forest plots.  
 
16.4 Interim Analysis Design for Primary Endpoint 
 
No interim analysis is planned for the primary endpoint.

To address secondary objective 2.21, we will carry out t he same set of analyses described in 
section 16.3 for overall survival (OS), which is defined as the time from randomization to death of any causes.  
 
To address secondary objective 2.22, we will estimate the proportion of  patients who respond 
(completely or partially) to each treatment as well as their 95% confidence intervals. Response 
rates will be tested using Fisher’s exact test and multivariately using a logistic regression model  
with performance status, gender and ge netic mutation type and other significant prognostic 
factors .[Cox et al. , 1989] 
 
To address secondary objective 2.23, we will estimate the progression free survival of patients with different mutation type s (exon deletion 19 vs. exon 21 L858R ), and test survival difference 
of these subgroups  using Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for treatment  effect . 
The robustness of treatment effect in different subgroups will be examined in a Forest plot.  
To address secondary objective 2.24, we will tabulate the types and the frequency of treatment -
related adverse events for erlotinib and bevacizumab and erlotinib using CTCAE version 4.0.  To address correlative objective 2.31, we will evaluate the agreement of EGFR mutations 
detected in plasma DNA with those detected in tumor DNA. Since only those patients with tumor EGFR mutation will have plasma EGFR mutation determined, we are able to estimate the 
true positive rate (sensitivity) but not the false positive rate (1 -specificity).  
 
To addre ss correlative objective 2.32, we will estimate the prevalence of EGFR  T790M 
resistance mutations from pre- treatment tumor.  
 
To address correlative objective 2.33, we will investigate the effect of EGFR T790M on progression- free survival using similar meth ods for 2.23.  
 To address correlative objective 2.34, we will use time-dependent ROC curve and AUC to evaluate the predictive value of plasma VEGF -A levels on progression free survival in patients 
treated with erlotinib alone or erlotinib/bevacizumab.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_367245] 20 patients in the erlotinib and bevacizumab arm (or 25% of all 
patients after 20 are accrued) experience grade 4/5 non -hematologic adverse events (excluding 
diarrhea and rash) that are probably, possibly, or definitely related to study treatment, OR if the rate of treatment -related deaths within the first [ADDRESS_367246] 20 patients (or >20% after the first 20 patients in either arm) at any time, accrual to the 
RC1126 61 Addendum 10 
study will be suspended to allow for investigation. After consideration by [CONTACT_3476] (study 
chair[s], statistician, etc.) and the primary IRB, a decision will be made as to whether accrual 
can be resumed , potentially with modifications to entry criteria and/or study condu ct.  In 
addition, all toxicity patterns will be monitored by [CONTACT_300842] a bi- annual basis . 
 
16.[ADDRESS_367247] enrollment.  
 
As of Addendum 5, the sample size is reduced and the accrual time is shorten ed to 
approximately 3.6 years.   
16.8 Study Monitoring (reports)  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_300843] (DSMB).  
Reports containing patient characteristics, toxicity, and administrative information will be 
provided to the DSMB every six months, with the first report due at the first reporting period after study initiation.  
 
16.9a Missing Data  
Missing and incomplete data will be identified through a review of the tables and listings of 
summarizing avail able data. Identified missing and incomplete data will be resolved  by 
[CONTACT_300844]. In general,  unresolvable missing data will be treated as 
missing  in all analyses . The secondary  endpoints, such as response rate, patients without an 
assessment  of disease  response will be treated as non -responder . 
 
16.9b Primary Endpoint Completion Time Estimation  
 
It will take additional l2 months of follow -up after the last enrollment to have the primary 
endpoint completion, or equivalently about 5.[ADDRESS_367248] enrollment.  
 
The time of analysis (after first patient enrolled), at which 69 events occur, is estimated to be 53 months (95% CI=47-55 months).  The analysis will be conducted after  [ADDRESS_367249] 
occurred .

17.2 Diagnostic Slides from Original Tissue : None.  
 
17.3 Paraffin Embedded Tissue Blocks/Slides  
 
17.31 Submit one formalin fixed paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block with largest 
amount of invasive tumor (at least 1 cm of tumor for cases of surgical resection) from original surgery for NSCLC .  A corresponding H&E slide for each submitted block 
must be provided  to permit quality assessment of each tissue block.   
 
17.32 The FFPE tissue block is preferred; however, if an institution is unable to provide a 
tissue block , cut 17 five micron sections (labeled 1 -17) and mount on charged glass 
slides AND cut  5 ten micr on sections (labeled 18 -22) and mount on uncharged glass 
slides. Label the slides with ACCRU patient ID number, accession number, order 
of sections (i.e., 1- 22) and thickness of section (i.e., 5 or 10 micron) . H&E stain every 
10
th slide  (i.e., slides labeled 1, 11). These H&E slides will be reviewed centrally under 
the research base’s protocol for assessing tissue quality. The remaining unstained slides will be processed as described in 17.5. Ideally, each slide must have a minimum of 75% 
tumor tissue on the slide to be deemed adequate for study. Do not bake or place covers 
slips on the slides.  
 
17.33 The following materials below are mandatory (unless indicated otherwise) and required 
for shipment:  
• Paraffin embedded tissue blocks with corresponding H&E slide (OR unstained 
slides with corresponding H&E(s) per table in Section 17.11 above ). 
• Research Tissue Submission Form 
• Surgical Pathology Report 
• Operative Report  (optional) 
 
Note: Please include the ACCRU patient ID number on all materials listed above.   
RC1126 63 Addendum 10 
 
17.34 The block/slides must be appropriately packed to prevent damage (e.g., slides should be 
placed in appropriate slide container) and placed in an individual plastic bag. Label the 
bag with the protocol number, ACCRU patient ID number, and patient initi als. 
 
17.[ADDRESS_367250] be shipped ≤30 days after registration.  
 
17.36 Verify that the appropriate sections of the Research Tissue Specimen Submission Form 
are completed and filled in correctly. Enter information from the Research Tissue 
Specimen  Submission Form into the remote data entry system on the same day the 
specimen is submitted (see Forms Packet).  
 
17.37 Ship all block/slide tissue specimens and accompanying materials to the ACCRU 
Research Base:  
 
ACCRU Operations Office  
 
 
 
17.38 If a corresponding H&E wasn’t submitted with the block/slides, the ACCRU 
Operations Office will request a slide to be processed (i.e., cut and H&E stained) from the tumor tissue block and forwarded the cytotechnologist, Hilton 10, to be reviewed 
under the research base’s protocol for assessing tissue quality for the proposed 
correlative studies, unless the tumor size is too small.  If the tumor tissue is too small, 
assessment of tissue quality will occur at the time the translational studies are 
performed. 
 
17.39a After the pathologist assesses the tissue quality, the block and appropriate paperwork 
will be returned to the ACCRU Operations Office. 
 
17.39b When an appropria te request is submitted, the ACCRU Operations Office will forward 
the blocks/slides to  the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Translational Research Laboratory 
 for processing as outlined in Section 
17.5. 
 
17.4 Frozen  Tumor Tissue :None 
 
17.[ADDRESS_367251] identified in 2004 as a co-mutation with 
L858R in a pretreatment lung cancer specimen, one of 111 EGFR-mutant tumors studied.[ Kosaka et al. , 2004] In 2006, it was shown that with more sensitive testing 
methods (mutant-enriched PCR) T790M could be found in 4% of pretreatment EGFR-
mutant lung cancers, [Inukai  et al. , 2006 ] and these cases were found to not respond to 
TKI. More recently, both Maheswaran et al  and Rosell et al found that, with multiple 
cycles of DNA amplification, highly sensitive assays could detect a T790M co -mutation 
in as many as 38% of baseline specimens, [Maheswaran  et al. , 2008, Rosell  et al. , 2011] 
making it a potential biomarker of poorer outcome on TKI. However, these studies were both performed with techniques that can be associated with false positive results 
thus obscuring the potential clinical relevance of this mutation if detected from a pre-
treatment tumor specimen.  

RC1126 64 Addendum 10 
 
In the current study we will evaluate EGFR T790M from pre -treatment specimens using 
techniques that are optimized to prevent false positive amplifications of T790M. These 
include the use of a locked nucleic acid (LNA) to block amplification of wild- type 
DNA allows identification of T7 90M in as little as 0.1% of DNA (Arcila, CCR, 2011). 
A new T790M assay developed at DFCI and by [CONTACT_300845]. and uses coamplification at a lower denaturation temperature (COLD) -PCR. [Li et al. , 2009 ] By 
[CONTACT_300846]-type DNA, this technique could prevent the appearance of false peaks and reduce the risk of false positive results.  
 We will evaluate the prevalence of EGFR T790M from pre-treatment tumor specimens. In addition, we will correlate the outcome of patients (as measured by [CONTACT_300847]) with and without evidence of pre -treatment T790M in each arm of the study.  
The ability to perform these studies will be dependent on the pre- treatment prevalence 
of EGFR T790M in patients enrolling in this clinical trial.  
 
Submitted tissue samples will be analyzed as follows:  
 
17.52 FFPE tumor tissue blocks/slides will be collected in order to assess the prevalence of baseline EGFR T790M and to correlate the findings with progression free survival in 
each of the treatment arms. The H&E slides will be reviewed by  a cytotechnologist to 
assess tumor content of the specimen. Appropriately identified tumor sections will then be used to isolate DNA. The analyses for EGFR T790M w ill be performed in Dr. 
Jänne’s laboratory at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. They will be performed in a 
blinded fashion without knowledge of patient outcome or treatment arm of the study.  
 
17.53 At the completion of the study, any unused/remaining material will be stored in the 
ACCRU Central Operations Office (attn: Pathology Coordinator) for future research according to the patient consent permission (see Section 6.16). Potential future research 
may include immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses, DNA extraction, and/or tissue 
microarray (TMA) construction to analyze predictive biomarkers, changes in expression 
pattern with therapy, and correlation with response and/or adverse events. For TMAs, 
the do nor block remains intact except for 6 small (0.6mm) holes where the cores were 
taken. This process has minimal impact on the utility of the block for future clinical 
diagnostic needs. When a protocol is developed, it will be presented for IRB review and 
approval. 
 
17.54 Banking of tumor tissue, according to the patient consent permission (see Section 6.5),  
is for future research. As protocols are developed, they will be presented for ACCRU 
and IRB review and approval. (This collection is part of a general strategy of 
investigation for Mayo Clinic Cancer Center lung studies.)  
 17.[ADDRESS_367252] will be notified by [CONTACT_300848] 
(Pathology Coordinator) if the block may be depleted.

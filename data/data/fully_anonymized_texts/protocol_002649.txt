Protocol Title:   A Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_783612]-Impaired Adults with Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1 – 6 
Infection (EXPEDITION-5)
Objectives:  
!The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy (by [CONTACT_187796] 12) and safety of glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_783613] (GLE/PIB) in adults with 
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1 – 6 infection with or without compensated 
cirrhosis and with chronic renal impairment in both HCV treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects.  The efficacy of GLE/PIB will be assessed based on the overall population (i.e., across treatment durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status) and the safety of GLE/PIB will be assessed by [CONTACT_783618]. 
!Secondary objectives are to assess the percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic 
failure and the percentage of subjects with HCV virologic relapse across treatment durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status.
Investigators:   Multicenter trial
Study Sites:   Approximately 40 sites globally
Study Population:   Chronic HCV GT1 – 6-infected adults aged 18 years or older with chronic renal 
impairment.  Subjects with renal impairment will include Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 3b (eGFR 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m
2), Stage 4 (eGFR 15 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and Stage 5 
(eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2or dialysis-dependent) subjects.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 120 subjects
Methodology:   
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
GLE/PIB for 8, 12, or 16 weeks in chronic HCV GT1 – 6 infected subjects with chronic renal 
impairment, with or without compensated cirrhosis, who are either HCV treatment-naïve (TN) or prior treatment-experienced (TE) with interferon (IFN) or pegylated IFN (pegIFN) with or without ribavirin 
(RBV), or sofosbuvir (SOF) plus RBV with or without pegIFN.
This study will enroll approximately 120 eligible subjects at approximately 40 sites.  Subjects with renal 
impairment will include CKD Stage 3b (eGFR 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m
2), Stage 4 (eGFR 15 to 
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and Stage 5 (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2or dialysis-dependent) subjects.  The 
study enrollment will be monitored to meet the following non-mutually exclusive enrollment criteria:  (1) up to approximately 40 subjects with Stage 3b CKD, (2) up to approximately 75 HCV GT1-infected subjects, (3) up to approximately 30 subjects with compensated cirrhosis.

Methodology (Continued):  
Subjects will be enrolled to one of the following treatment arms:
!Arm A:  HCV GT1, 2, 4 – 6 subjects without cirrhosis who are TN or TE and HCV 
GT 3 subjects without cirrhosis who are TN will be treated for 8 weeks. 
!Arm B:  HCV GT1, 2, 4 – 6 subjects with cirrhosis who are TN or TE and HCV GT 3 subjects with cirrhosis who are TN will be treated for 12 weeks.  
!Arm C:  All HCV GT3 subjects who are TE will be treated for 16 weeks.
Note:  Subjects with mixed HCV genotype infection should receive whichever duration is longer based on their genotypes, cirrhosis status and treatment experience.  For subjects with an indeterminate genotype, treatment duration will default to the respective GT3 duration based upon treatment-experience and cirrhosis status.
The study will consist of a Screening Period, Treatment period and Post Treatment period:Treatment Period:
Enrolled subjects will receive GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg once daily (QD) for 8 weeks (Arm A), 12 weeks 
(Arm B), or 16 weeks (Arm C).  Scheduled visits in the Treatment Period consist of Day [ADDRESS_1077463]-Treatment Period:
Subjects who complete or prematurely discontinue the Treatment Period will be followed for [ADDRESS_1077464] visits at Weeks 4, 12, and 24 following 
completion or premature discontinuation of the Treatment Period.  Study procedures to monitor safety, clinical laboratory tests, HCV RNA, and to evaluate the efficacy and the emergence and persistence of resistant virus will be conducted during these visits.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs):
The Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36™) will be used to assess the impact of kidney disease 
on a patient's quality of life.
Resistance:
The following information will be tabulated and summarized:  1) for all subjects with available samples, 
baseline polymorphisms at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions relative to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence; and 2) for subjects who do not achieve SVR
12, post-baseline 
substitutions relative to baseline.
Pharmacokinetic:
Individual plasma concentrations of glecaprevir and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761], and their possible metabolites will be 
tabulated and summarized.  
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 
[ADDRESS_1077470] actual dose of study drug) based on overall population (i.e., across treatment 
durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status).  The primary endpoint will be analyzed based on intention-to-treat (ITT) population.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be summarized 
with a two-sided 95% confidence interval based on the normal approximation of the binomial 
distribution unless the number of SVR 12non-responders is less than 5, where the Wilson's score method 
will be used to calculate the confidence interval.  No hypothesis will be tested.
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:
!The percentage of subjects with on-treatment HCV virologic failure across treatment arms
!The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse across treatment arms
For on-treatment virologic failure and post-treatment relapse, the number and percentage of subjects will 
be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using Wilson's score method.  Analyses 
of additional efficacy endpoints and efficacy subgroup analyses will be performed.
PROs:
Change from baseline to each applicable visit in the patient reported outcome summary measures will be 
summarized.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Resistance:
For all subjects receiving study drugs and with available samples, baseline polymorphisms at signature 
[CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions identified by [CONTACT_48832] (NGS) and 
comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving study drugs who do not 
achieve SVR 12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA M 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid 
substitutions in available post-baseline samples identified by [CONTACT_187812], 2) the amino acid substitutions in available post-baseline samples at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated positions identified by [CONTACT_187813], and 3) the persistence of viral substitutions by [CONTACT_077].
Pharmacokinetic:
Individual plasma concentrations of glecaprevir, pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761], and their possible metabolites will be 
tabulated and summarized. 
Safety:
Safety summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_783619].  All 
subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.  Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug through [ADDRESS_1077472] study drug dosing) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and preferred term.  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events also will be provided by [CONTACT_187799].  Change from baseline in laboratory tests and vital signs measurements to each time point of collection will be summarized, and vital sign values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be summarized by [CONTACT_783620].  Changes from baseline to post-baseline in the CTCAE grading of laboratory values will 
also be summarized.

3.0 Introduction
Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with over 
170 million individu als infected worldwide.1  There are 7 identified HCV genotypes, with 
genotype 1 (GT1) being the most prevalent worldwide.2  HCV genotypes 2 (GT2) and 3 
(GT3) infections are more common in Latin America (5% to 30%), Europe (20% to 40%) and Asia (30% to 45%).
3-[ADDRESS_1077492] Asia, and GT7 has recently been described in Central Africa.
6
Depending on various risk factors, between 10% and 40% of patients with chronic HCV infection will develop cirrhosis.
7  Death related to the complications of cirrhosis may 
occur at an incidence of approximately 4% per year; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in this population at an estimated incidence of 1% to 5% per year.
[ADDRESS_1077493] a 33% probability of death during the first year.7  Successful 
treatment of HCV has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression and related mortality as well as the development of HCC.
8,9
Infection with HCV is common among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) 
undergoing dialysis in the US, EU and Japan with a prevalence of 3% to 23%, depending on the country.
[ADDRESS_1077494]-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in patients with severe renal impairment (i.e., creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) is limited.  Currently approved regimens to treat patients with severe renal impairment include ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with dasabuvir with or without ribavirin (RBV) for HCV GT1 infection, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with RBV for HCV GT4 infection, and

known as ABT-493), an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (PIB, formerly known as ABT-530), an NS5A inhibitor, for use in combination for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.  GLE and PIB each have potent in vitro antiviral activity against genotypes [ADDRESS_1077496] common resistant-associated substitutions.  Additive or synergistic in vitro anti-HCV activity has been demonstrated with the combination of GLE and PIB.  GLE 100 mg and PIB 40 mg are co-formulated into a fixed-dose combination tablet (hereafter referred to as GLE/PIB), which provides patients with a convenient once-daily (QD), fixed-dose combination treatment regimen of three tablets QD to maximize treatment compliance.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical pharmacol ogy and toxicology, in vitro virology 
and metabolism, and clinical data can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (GLE/PIB)
Overview of GLE/PIB Registrational Program and Supportive Studies
The GLE/PIB registrational program included a broad subject population including 
subjects with compensated liver disease and subjects with severe renal insufficiency   across all genotypes using a single GLE/PIB dose of 300 mg/120 mg QD.  Supportive Phase 2 studies used the Phase 2 formulation of separate GLE and PIB tablets, with each tablet containing 100 mg and 40 mg, respectively.  Treatment arms from these supportive Phase 2 studies using the regimen selected for registrational studies (GLE 300 mg plus PIB 120 mg) were pooled with arms from the registrational studies for analyses of efficacy and safety.  Treatment-naïve (TN) and TE subjects to any combination of pegylated IFN (pegIFN), RBV, sofosbuvir (SOF), NS5A inhibitors, or PIs were allowed

in the program.  In addition, the program included subjects with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection (Study M13-590), subjects with chronic kidney disease [CKD] Stages 4 – 5, including those on hemodialysis (Study M15-462), subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Studies M14-172, M15-462, and M14-868 Part 3), and subjects with or without cirrhosis who failed a previous regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor and/or an NS3/4A PI (Study M15-410).

M16-[ADDRESS_1077502] of Baseline Polymorphisms on Treatment Outcome
The association between baseline polymorphisms and treatment outcome in subjects who 
received GLE 300 mg QD with PIB 120 mg QD in the registrational or supportive Phase 2 studies was evaluated by [CONTACT_783621].  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted on all baseline samples at 15% 
detection threshold at key amino acid positions 155, 156, and 168 in NS3, and 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, and 93 in NS5A. 
In subjects who were TN or TE-PRS, baseline polymorphisms in NS3 were detected in 
1.1% (9/845), 0.8% (3/398), 1.6% (10/613), 1.2% (2/164), 41.9% (13/31), and 2.9% (1/34) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 infection, respectively.  Baseline polymorphisms in NS5A were detected in 26.8% (225/841), 79.8% (331/415), 22.1% (136/615), 49.7% (80/161), 12.9% (4/31), and 54.1% (20/37) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection, respectively.
The presence of baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and/or NS5A did not have an impact on 
SVR
12rates for GT1-, 2-, 4-, 5-, or 6-infected subjects.
Within GT3-infected subjects, baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and the NS5A

Amino Acid Substitutions in Subjects Experiencing Virologic Failure
Among TN and TE-PRS subjects with or without cirrhosis treated for 8, 12, or 16 weeks, 
23 subjects experienced virologic failure (2 with GT1, 2 with GT2, and 19 with GT3).  One GT3-infected subject experiencing virologic failure was determined to have been reinfected with GT3a virus distinct from the one present at baseline.  Therefore, baseline polymorphisms and treatment-emergent substitutions were analyzed for 22 subjects experiencing virologic failure. 
Among the 2 GT1-infected subjects, 1 had treatment-emergent substitutions A156V in

NS3 and Q30R/L31M/H58D in NS5A, and 1 had treatment-emergent Q30R/H58D (while 
Y93N was present at baseline and post-treatment) in NS5A.
Among the 2 GT2-infected subjects, no treatment-emergent substitutions were observed 
in NS3 or NS5A; the prevalent M31 polymorphism in NS5A was present at baseline and post-treatment in both subjects.
Among the 18 GT3-infected subjects, the majority of subjects had treatment-emergent 
variants at the time of failure in NS3 (61.1%, 11/18) and NS5A (88.9%, 16/18).  Treatment-emergent NS3 substitutions Y56H/N, Q80K/R, A156G, and Q168L/R were observed in [ADDRESS_1077505]-treatment in 5 subjects.  Treatment-emergent NS5A substitutions M28G, A30G/K, L31F, P58T, or Y93H were observed in 16 subjects, and 13 subjects had A30K (n = 9) or Y93H (n = 5) at both baseline and post-treatment.
Integrated Safety Results
A summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) from pooled analyses of the 
registrational studies and supportive Phase 2 studies are presented in Table 3 .  The 
severity of the underlying renal disease and its associated comorbidities in patients with 
CKD Stages 4 and 5, the frequency and severity of the AEs in subjects enrolled Study M15-462 were expected to be higher than in subjects enrolled in the other registrational studies.  Therefore, the summary of adverse events reported in Table 3 does 
not include the results of Study M15-462 which is listed separately.
As shown in Table 3 , the AEs occurring with a frequency M 5% are headache, fatigue, 
nausea and diarrhea.  The majority of subje cts experienced an AE, which were mostly 
considered to be mild in severity by [CONTACT_093] (Grade 1).  Rates of AEs that were 
serious, led to premature study drug discontinuation or had a severity Grade M [ADDRESS_1077506] dose of study drug.

Adverse events in subjects without cirrhosis (n = 1,977) were similar in type, frequency, 
and severity compared with subjects with cirrhosis (n = 288).  The safety profile in subjects with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection (n = 33) was similar to that in HCV monoinfected subjects.  Overall, the safety profile of GLE/PIB in the elderly population ( M 65 years old, 
n = 328) was comparable to the safety profile in the non-elderly population (n = 2,041).
In Study M15-462, GLE/PIB was generally well-tolerated in subjects with CKD Stage 4 
and 5 as evidenced by a treatment discontinuation rate of 1.9% (2/104) due to AEs that were considered DAA-related.  No subject experienced a serious AE that was assessed as DAA-related.  The safety profile in subjects in Study M15-462 was consistent with

Pruritus was not an unexpected finding, as it is commonly observed in patients with severe renal impairment.  Laboratory abnormalities were infrequent with no subject experiencing a Grade [ADDRESS_1077509] experiencing a Grade 3 elevation in total bilirubin.

In summary, GLE/PIB demonstrated a favorable safety profile similar across durations of 
8, 12, and [ADDRESS_1077513] and diverse population of subjects, including subjects with cirrhosis, HIV coinfection, and CKD Stage 4 or 5.   
Common study drug-related AEs occurring in M 5% of subjects were headache, fatigue, 
nausea and were mostly Grade 1 (mild) in severity.  Serious AEs and AEs leading to 
premature study drug discontinuation were rare.  There were no hematological or blood 
chemistry findings of concern or considered likely related to treatment.  Unlike other 
protease inhibitors, no liver-related toxicities and no cases consistent with drug-induced liver injury were identified.
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB in CKD 
Stage 3b, 4 and 5 subjects with HCV GT1 – 6 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis.
3.1 Differences Statement
The Phase 3 registration Study M15-462 evaluated GLE/PIB for a duration of 12 weeks, 
regardless of cirrhosis status or prior treatment experience, in HCV GT1 – 6-infected subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m
2) or ESRD (estimated GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or requiring 
dialysis).  The patient population in Study M16-127 will be expanded compared to 
Study M15-462 to include subjects with less severe chronic renal disease by [CONTACT_783622] 40 subjects with CKD Stage 3b (eGFR 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m
2) and will also 
include HCV GT3-infected subjects with prior treatment experience.  Compared to Study M15-462 which evaluated a single treatment duration of 12 weeks, the present study will evaluate treatment durations 8, 12 and 16 weeks based on HCV genotype, cirrhosis status and prior treatment experience.

3.2 Benefits and Risks
This Phase 3b study is a three arm study in which eligible HCV GT1 – 6 infected subjects 
will receive GLE/PIB for 8, 12 or 16 weeks based on their genotype, cirrhosis status and prior treatment experience.  The combination of GLE/PIB has been evaluated in six Phase [ADDRESS_1077515] that the likelihood of successfully demonstrating a high SVR
12rate in 
HCV GT1 – 6 subjects with renal impairment is high.
The Phase 3 Study M15-462 evaluated a 12 week duration of GLE/PIB in 104 CKD 
Stage 4 and 5 subjects, including 85 subjects on hemodialysis, with HCV GT1 –6 infection with and without cirrhosis.  The SVR
12rate of 98% (102/104) was observed 
based on the ITT population; no subject experienced virologic failure.  In addition, the 
regimen was generally well-tolerated in subjects with renal impairment as evidenced by a low treatment-discontinuation rate due to AEs, no drug-related serious AEs, AEs that were mostly mild to moderate in severity and infrequent laboratory abnormalities.  These 
results support the recommendation that adults with chronic HCV infection and severe renal impairment and ESRD follow the duration recommendations for subjects with normal renal function.  
At present, no DAA regimen is approved for use in patients with HCV GT 2, 3, 5 and 
6 infection with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).  In addition, approved DAA regimens for use in patients with HCV GT1 and 4 often include the use of RBV which is associated with toxicity in this patient population.  There fore, identification of a 
safe, efficacious, RBV-sparing regimen is a benefit for the CKD Stage 4 and 5 population.  
Moreover, an 8 week treatment duration in HCV GT1 – 6 treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis is a benefit compared to currently available regimens which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 12 weeks or more in duration.  Other potenti al benefits of treatment with GLE/PIB 
include a higher genetic barrier to development of drug resistance compared to 
first generation protease and NS5A inhibitors and the development of resistance was infrequently observed as high rates of SVR
12were demonstrated across the Phase 2 and 
3 studies.

M16-[ADDRESS_1077516] 2016-004182-60
29
In the Phase 2 and 3 studies, no significant toxicity or trends in liver chemistry 
abnormalities were observed and rates of study drug-related-SAEs and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were low.  Case s of potentially clinically significant ALT and 
total bilirubin elevations were rare in the Phase 2 and 3 analysis set with ALT elevations 
> 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) occurring in < 0.1% (2/2,265) subjects and total bilirubin elevations > 3 × ULN occurring in 0.4% (8/2,265) subjects; no cases consistent with drug induced liver injury (DILI) were reported.  No subject discontinued study drug due to ALT or bilirubin elevations.
Additional risks associated with GLE/PIB include the development of 
resistance-associated substitutions.  In subjects treated with a DAA, amino acid substitution(s) in the targeted protein conferring resistance to the DAA can be selected.  It is expected that PIB, an NS5A inhibitor, will be able to suppress the appearance of virus containing resistance-associated substitutions in NS3 that confer resistance to GLE, because there should not be any cross-resistance in substitutions resistant to DAAs targeting different proteins.  The converse is expected to be true as well – GLE should be able to suppress the appearance of virus containing NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to PIB.  In addition, in vitro resistant colony selection studies in HCV replicon cells containing GT1 – 6 NS5A demonstrated that PIB had a high genetic barrier to resistance – very few colonies were selected, and most of those that were selected contained NS5A substitutions that conferred only modest levels of resistance to PIB.  Based on accumulated clinical and in vitro data to date, the risk of development of resistance-associated substitutions during GLE and PIB combination trials is reduced when compared to treatment with first generation protease and NS5A inhibitors.  The combination of PIB and GLE achieved high SVR rates with few virologic failures in the Phase 2 and 3 studies.  These results support the prediction that the risk of development of resistance-associated substitutions with GLE and PIB combination treatment is low.
Risks associated with GLE/PIB, including the risks of AEs, hepatic laboratory
abnormalities, virologic failure and develop ment of resistance-associated substitutions, 
appear limited and manageable based on the results from the Phase 2 and 3 studies.  Given 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_1077517] 2016-004182-60

the potential for achieving high rates of cure  in renally-impaired HCV GT1 – 6 subjects, 
the risk-benefit balance is favorable.

The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy (by [CONTACT_783623] 12) and safety of GLE/PIB in adults with chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1 – 6 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis and with chronic renal impairment in both HCV treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects.  The efficacy of GLE/PIB will be assessed based on the overall population (i.e., across treatment durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status) and the safety of GLE/PIB will be assessed by [CONTACT_783618].
4.2 Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives are to assess efficacy of GLE/PIB based on overall population 
(i.e., across treatment durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status) by [CONTACT_167405]:
DThe percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure;
DThe percentage of subjects with HCV virologic relapse.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB for 8, 12, or 16 weeks in HCV GT1 – 6-infected subjects with chronic renal impairment, with or without compensated cirrhosis, who are either HCV treatment-naïve or prior treatment-experienced with interferon [IFN] or pegylated IFN [pegIFN] with or without RBV, or sofosbuvir [SOF] plus RBV with or without pegIFN.

Period.
Screening Period:  Subjects have up to 42 days following the Screening Visit to confirm 
eligibility and enroll into the study.Treatment Period:  Eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg 
QD for 8 weeks (Arm A), 12 weeks (Arm B), or 16 weeks (Arm C). Post-Treatment Period:  Subjects who complete or prematurely discontinue the Treatment 
Period will be followed for [ADDRESS_1077519] dose of study drug to evaluate 
efficacy and to monitor HCV RNA, and the emergence and persistence of viral substitutions.

The study enrollment will be monitored to meet the following non-mutually exclusive 
enrollment criteria:  (1) up to approximately 40 subjects with Stage 3b CKD, (2) up to approximately 75 HCV GT1-infected subjects, (3) up to approximately 30 subjects with compensated cirrhosis. 
The study population will include subjects w ith HCV GT1 – 6; subjects with mixed HCV 
genotype infection should receive whichever duration is longer based on their genotypes, 
cirrhosis status and treatment experience.  For subjects with an indeterminate genotype, treatment duration will default to the respective GT3 duration based upon treatment-experience and cirrhosis status.
Subjects with renal impairment will be categorized during screening as having CKD 
Stage 3b, Stage 4 or Stage 5; CKD categorization for each subject at screening will be used throughout the study.  These categories are defined according to eGFR in Table 4
below:
Table 4. Definition of Chronic Kidney Disease Stages
CKD Stage eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)*
3b 30 to < 45
4 15 to < 30
5 < 15 or requiring dialysis
* eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 × (Serum Creatinine)–1 154× Age–0 203× (0.742 if female) × (1.21 if black).
The study was designed to enroll approximately 120 eligible subjects to meet scientific 
and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if th e target number of subjects has been enrolled, 
there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.
5.1.1 Screening Period
At the Screening Visit, subjects who provide written (signed and dated) informed consent 
prior to any study-specific procedures will receive a unique subject number via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system.  The investigator w ill evalu ate whether

[IP_ADDRESS] Rescreening
Subjects who at Screening have any of the following are not eligible to rescreen or retest:
DA positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); or
DHBV DNA > LLOQ in subjects with isolated positive anti-HBc (i.e., negative 
HBsAg and Anti-HBs); or
DA confirmed positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test; or
DA confirmed positive pregnancy test (if female).
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria with the exception of laboratory parameters may 
retest once within the 42-day screening period without prior [COMPANY_013] approval.
Subjects who have exclusionary laboratory parameter(s) are allowed to retest on the 
related panel(s) (e.g., exclusionary albumin requires a repeat chemistry panel) within the 
same screening period and must meet all eligibility laboratory criteria on any panel that is repeated.  If any of the retest result(s) are exclu sionary, the subject may not be rescreened.
Subjects who fail to enroll within [ADDRESS_1077523]/rescreen, the site personnel must contact [CONTACT_783624] a screen failure.

5.1.2 Treatment Period (TP)
After meeting the eligibility criteria, subjects will be enrolled via IRT system.  Subjects 
will be administered study drug at the site on Study Day 1, with dosing instructions.
Study visits and procedures during the Treatment Period are detailed in Appendix C .  
Safety and tolerability will be assesse d throughout the study.  Laboratory testing will 
include chemistry and hematology as specified in Table 6 .  Plasma samples for 
pharmacokinetic analysis and HCV RNA analysis will be collected as detailed in 
Section 5.3.1 and Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Blood samples for optional pharmacogenetic analysis 
will be collected as detailed in Appendix C .
All subjects will continue to return to the site on an outpatient basis as outlined in 
Appendix C .  Sites should ensure that subjects adhere to all study visits.  Subjects who 
cannot complete their study visit per the visit schedule should ensure they do not run out 
of study drug prior to their next study visit.  Compliance is critical to ensure adequate 
drug exposure.
HCV virologic failure criterion will be evaluated and applied by [CONTACT_783625] [IP_ADDRESS] .
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Treatment Period should return for a Treatment Discontinuation Visit and undergo the study procedures as outlined in Appendix C and as described in Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_1077525]-Treatment (PT) Period
All subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and either complete treatment or 
prematurely discontinue study drug will be monitored in the Post-Treatment Period for safety, clinical laboratory tests, HCV RNA, and the emergence and persistence of resistant viral substitutions for an additional [ADDRESS_1077526] dose of study drug.

achieving SVR is unknown.
For subjects who had multiple HCV treatment courses, the categorization of previous 
response category will be based on the last prior treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Therapy
The investigator should confirm that a conc omitant medication/supplemen t can be safely 
administered with study drugs.  Some medications may require dose adjustments due to 
the potential for drug-drug interactions.  The investigator should refer to product labeling as needed to determine if, due to renal impairment, some medications may be contraindicated or require dose adjustment.

Liver Diagnostic Testing
Subjects will be considered to be non-ci rrhotic or cirrhotic based on the definitions below:
Non-Cirrhotic
DA liver biopsy within 24 months prior to or during Screening demonstrating 
the absence of cirrhosis, e.g., a METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, 
Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of ] 3, Ishak fibrosis score of ]  4; or
DA FibroScan®score of < 12.5 kPa within ] 6 months of Screening or during 
Screening period; or
DA Screening FibroTest score of ] 0.48 and Aspartate Aminotransferase to 
Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) < 1.
Cirrhotic
DPrevious histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis on liver biopsy, e.g., METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of > 3, Ishak 
score of > 4 or on a liver biopsy conducted during Screening; or
DA FibroScan
®score of M 12.5 kPa at any time prior to screening or during 
Screening period; or
DA Screening FibroTest result that is M 0.75 and an APRI > 2.
In the absence of a qualifying liver biopsy, subjects with an indeterminate FibroTest result 
(0.48 < result < 0.75), or conflicting FibroTest and APRI results (e.g., FibroTest ] 0.48, 
but APRI M 1) should be evaluated based on the investigator's clinical judgment to 
determine the presence or absence of cirrhosis. 
If more than one method is used to determine the presence or absence of cirrhosis, the 
results of a liver biopsy will take precedence over FibroScan and FibroTest/APRI and the results of FibroScan will take precedence over FibroTest/APRI.
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_1077563] Child-Pugh scores assessed.  The 
Child-Pugh score uses five clinical measures of liver disease (3 laboratory parameters and 2 clinical assessments).  Child-Pugh score will be determined only for subjects with compensated cirrhosis at the visits indicated in Appendix C and Appendix D .

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is an open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GLE/PIB administered 
for 8, 12 or 16 weeks in renally impaired subjects (CKD Stages 3b to 5) with HCV GT1 –
6, with or without compensated cirrhosis.  The combination regimen of GLE/PIB was 
evaluated in non-renally impaired HCV GT1 – 6 infected subjects with and without 
compensated cirrhosis in the registrational studies and in CKD Stage 4 and 5 subjects with and without cirrhosis in the EXPEDITION-4 study (discussed in detail in Section 3.0).  
Based upon the results of these studies, [COMPANY_013] plans to evaluate the same combination regimen of GLE/PIB used in the registrational studies in an expanded population of renally-impaired subjects for durations consistent with the proposed label-recommendation.  The selection of a three arm study design is appropriate in order to ensure that subjects receive the appropriate treatment duration based on their genotype, cirrhosis status and prior treatment experience.  
In view of the expected high SVR rate in this study and the established safety profile of 
GLE/PIB in patients with renal impairment, a control arm would be of limited value for efficacy comparison.  In this context, an open-label, three-arm study is appropriate to adequately describe the efficacy and safety of this regimen when administered for the proposed label recommended durations.  
5.6.[ADDRESS_1077590] Population
This study is planned to enroll treatment-naïve or previous treatment-experienced (IFN or 
pegIFN with or without RBV, pegIFN/RBV plus SOF, or SOF plus RBV) chronic HCV GT1 – 6-infected subjects, with or without compensated cirrhosis, with CKD Stages 3b to 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]

5.  With the exception of CKD Stage 3b subjects and the more inclusive eligibility criteria 
implemented in this study (e.g., GT3 treatment-experienced subjects, removal of specific laboratory, BMI and medical history exclusion criteria), the population enrolled in this 
study will be comparable to the population enrolled in the EXPEDITION-4 study.  In 
addition, with the exception of renal impairment, the study population is comparable to that enrolled in the broader registrational Phase 2 and 3 studies in non-CKD subjects.  
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Dose Selections
The dose of GLE/PIB 300 mg/[ADDRESS_1077592] shown high SVR
12rates with a favorable safety profile.
[IP_ADDRESS] GLE and PIB Dose and Treatment Duration
The Phase 3 study EXPEDITION-4 evaluated a 12 week duration of GLE/PIB in 
104 CKD Stage 4 and 5 subjects, including 85 subjects on hemodialysis, with HCV GT1 – 6 infection with and without cirrhosis.  The SVR
12rate of 98% (102/104) and no 
virologic failure was observed in this study support the use of GLE/PIB in renally-impaired subjects.  In the registrional program, the efficacy in CKD patients was comparable to that observed for non-CKD subjects, suggesting that treatment recommendations for CKD patients should fo llow those for patients without renal 
impairment.  Therefore, the current study will evaluate the proposed GLE/PIB label recommended treatment durations.  
As described in Section 3.0, the high SVR
12rates observed in non-CKD patients with and 
without cirrhosis support the proposed recommended treatment durations of 8, 12, and 
16 weeks based on genotype, cirrhosis status and prior treatment experience.

For adverse events, please refer to Sections 6.[ADDRESS_1077594] any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_41614].
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_1077595] 2016-004182-60
69
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are usually not considered to be AEs or serious adverse events (SAEs).  However, laboratory abnormalities or changes in vital signs that result in study drug discontinuation or interruption, necessitate 
therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.7
regarding toxicity management) and/or are deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_1275], should be recorded as AEs or SAEs as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occ ur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events

anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  
Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, bl ood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4).

The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is available from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf and is to be used in the grading of adverse events.  Below are the general grading categories.  However, the investigator should always search NCI CTCAE for a given diagnostic/symptomatic AE term to identify and apply specific grading details for that AE entity.
Grading system for Adverse Events (a semi-colon indicates 'or' within the description of 
the grade).
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL*
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25674]; disabling; 
limiting self-care ADL**
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 Death related to AE
ADL = Activities of Daily Living
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.
** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.
6.1.[ADDRESS_1077599] to the DAAs (GLE/PIB).  The 
investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the use of study drug:
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_1077600] 2016-004182-60
72
Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the 
event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and 
potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the 
event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and 
potential alternative causes, there is insufficient
evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_26183], an Other cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_112789].
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All serious adverse events as well as protocol-related nonserious adverse events 
(e.g., infection at liver biopsy site) will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent until study drug administration.  From the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_1077601]-Treatment Period, all spontaneously reported SAEs will be collected (nonserious AEs will not be collected).
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2 .

6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
Investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by [CONTACT_26280] (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE
®system, or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented 
on the SAE Non-CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Transaminase Elevation
If a subject experiences a post-baseline increase in ALT to > 5 × ULN and also > 2 × the 
baseline value, the subject should have a confirmatory ALT measurement performed.  If the ALT is confirmed to be > 5 × ULN and also > 2 × the baseline value, the recommendations below should be followed:
DComplete hepatic questionnaire.
DEvaluate for an alternate etiology for ALT elevation; document in the source, 
update the medical history and concomitant medications eCRF (if applicable), and obtain HBsAg, Anti-HBc IgM, Anti-HBc Total, Anti-HBs, HBV DNA, 
Anti-HAV IgM, Anti-HAV IgG, Anti-HEV IGM, Anti-HEV IgG, and HEV 
RNA and other additional tests, as appropriate.
DManage the subject as medically appropriate.
DRepeat ALT, AST, total and fractionated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and INR within 1 week.  Repeat liver chemistries as indicated until resolution.
DDiscontinue study drugs if any of the following is observed at any time:
^ALT level is M 20 × ULN in the absence of an alternate etiology.
^Increasing direct bilirubin or INR or onset of other symptoms/signs of liver 
failure.
^At the discretion of the investigator.
Alternate management of ALT increases requires approval of the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.

Efficacy analyses will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population defined as 
all enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug, unless otherwise 
specified.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint, when applicable, will be performed 
on the intention-to-treat population modified to exclude subjects who did not achieve SVR
12for reasons other than virologic failure (mITT-VF).
No data will be imputed for any efficacy or safety analysis except for analyses of SVR 
endpoints (HCV RNA data).  HCV RNA values will be selected for the analyses of all SVR endpoints (e.g., SVR
4, SVR 12, and SVR 24) based on defined visit windows.  A 
backward imputation method will be used to impute missing responses for SVR analyses.
8.1.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all subjects in the ITT 
population by [INVESTIGATOR_216] (A, B and C) and overall.  Demographics include age, weight, height, BMI, gender, race, and ethnicity.  Baseline characteristics will be summarized as continuous variables (where appropriate) and as categorical variables, including all subgroup variables defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , and including HCV genotype and subtype,  
prior HCV treatment history, baseline HCV RNA level, fibrosis stage (F0 – F1, F2, F3, or F4), dialysis (yes or no), CKD stage (Stage 3b, Stage 4, Stage 5), cirrhosis (yes/no), tobacco (user, ex-user, or non-user) and alcohol use (drinker, ex-drinker, or non-drinker) status, former injection drug user (yes, within last 12 months; yes, more than 12 months ago; or no), use of stable opi[INVESTIGATOR_187788], history of diabetes, history of depression or bipolar disorder, and geographic region.
All the demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized as continuous or 
categorical variables where appropriate.  Summary statistics (N, mean, median, SD, and range) will be generated for continuous variables (e.g., age and BMI), and the number and percentage of subjects will be presented for categorical variables (e.g., sex and race).
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_1077613] is considered to be compliant if the percentage is between 80% and 120%.  Compliance will be calculated for each subject and summarized with the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  The percentage of compliant subjects will be summarized.
8.1.2 Efficacy
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population, unless otherwise specified.  
The efficacy analyses will be performed based on overall population, i.e., across treatment
durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status. 
Plasma HCV RNA levels will be determined for each sample collected by [CONTACT_187827]
®AmpliPrep/COBAS®TaqMan®HCV Quantitative 
Test, v2.0.  The notation "HCV RNA < LLOQ" is used to represent all HCV RNA values < 15 IU/mL that are HCV RNA detected or HCV RNA not detected.  HCV RNA M LLOQ 
are all quantifiable values.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR
12(HCV 
RNA < LLOQ [ADDRESS_1077614] actual dose of study drug) based on overall 
population across treatment durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% 
confidence interval using the normal approx imation to the binomial distribution, unless 
the number of SVR 12non-responders is less than 5, where the Wilson's score method will 
be used to calculate the confidence interval instead.
A summary of reason for SVR 12non-response (e.g., on-treatment virologic failure, 
relapse, other) will be provided.

[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:
DThe percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure (defined 
as confirmed increase of > 1 log 10IU/mL above nadir during treatment, 
confirmed HCV RNA M 100 IU/mL after HCV RNA < LLOQ during 
treatment, or HCV RNA M LLOQ at the end of treatment with at least 6 weeks 
of treatment), and 
DThe percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse (defined 
as confirmed HCV RNA M LLOQ between end of treatment and [ADDRESS_1077616] dose of study drug among subjects who completed treatment as 
planned with HCV RNA < LLOQ at the end of treatment; excluding subjects who have been shown to be reinfected)
For the analysis of post-treatment HCV virologic relapse, completion of treatment is 
defined as any subject with study drug duration of [ADDRESS_1077617]-treatment relapse, the number and percentage 
of subjects will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% CI using Wilson's score method.
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity Analysis
As sensitivity analyses, the number and percentage of subjects in the mITT-VF population 
achieving SVR
12, as applicable, will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% 
confidence interval using the normal approximation and a two-sided 95% CI using the Wilson's score method.
The two-sided 95% confidence interval using Wilson's score method will also be 
calculated as a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint of SVR
12based on ITT 
population.

DThe percentage of subjects who relapse after achieving SVR 12.
The number and percentage of subjects meeting each additional efficacy endpoint w ill be 
summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson's score 
interval.
8.1.3 Patient Reported Outcomes
Subjects will complete the self-administered PRO instrument (where allowed per local 
regulatory guidelines) on the study days specified in Appendix C and Appendix D . 
Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other th an encouragement to complete the tasks.  
Subjects who are functionally unable to read the instrument may have site personnel read the questionnaire to them.  Site personnel will encourage completion of the instrument at all sp ecified visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items.
The mean change from baseline to each applicable post-baseline timepoint in KDQOL-36
(SF-12, burden of kidney disease, symptoms and problems and effects of kidney disease on daily life) will be summarized descriptively at each visit and for change from baseline to each post baseline visit.
Additional analyses of PROs will be performed as useful and appropriate.The PRO instrument should be completed prior any study procedures at each visit and 
prior to any discussion of adverse events or any review of laboratory findings, including HCV RNA levels.

8.1.4 Resistance Analyses
For all subjects, full length NS3/4A and NS5A from baseline samples will be sequenced 
by [CONTACT_077].  For subjects who do not achieve SVR 12, full length NS3/4A and NS5A from the 
first sample after failure/discontinuation with HCV RNA M 1000 IU/mL will be 
sequenced by [CONTACT_077].  An appropriate subtype specific prototypic reference sequence will 
be used for comparison with sequences fro m samples.  Subjects treated with study drug 
who do not achieve SVR 12due to reasons other than virologic failure but have a time 
point with HCV RNA M 1000 IU/mL after treatment discont inuation, will have the sample 
at that time point sequenced.
Only samples with an HCV RNA level of M 1000 IU/mL will undergo sequence analysis 
in order to allow accurate assessment of products of amplification.  Therefore, if the HCV 
RNA level at the time of HCV virologic failure or treatment discontinuation is < 1000 IU/mL, the sample closest in time after HCV virologic failure/treatment discontinuation with an HCV RNA level M 1000 IU/mL will be used.  Included time 
points for analyses on samples from subjects who do not achieve SVR
12are 1) the sample 
closest in time after failure/discontinuation with an HCV RNA level of M 1000 IU/mL,
and 2) [ADDRESS_1077623]-DAA treatment, provided that resistance-associated substitutions were detected by [CONTACT_291167]/treatment discontinuation.
For each DAA target, signature [CONTACT_308167] a key subset of amino acid 
positions are listed in Table 9 .  Appropriate subtype specific prototypic reference 
sequence will be used for comparison with sequences from samples.

The following definitions will be used in the HCV resistance analyses:
DBaseline polymorphism:  a polymorphism by [CONTACT_187828] a baseline sample ( M 2% 
or M 15% prevalence within a subject's viral population depending on 
polymorphism frequency threshold utilized) that was not present in the 
appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequence for a given DAA target 
(NS3/4A or NS5A).
DPolymorphism/substitution at a signature [CONTACT_187834]:  polymorphism 
(relative to reference) present in a baseline sample or substitution (relative to baseline) present in post-baseline sample at a signature [CONTACT_187834].
DPost-baseline substitution:  an amino acid substitution in a post-baseline time 
point sample that was not detected at baseline (< 2%) in the subject and is 
detectable in M 2% of the sequences from the post-baseline sample.
DEnriched polymorphism:  polymorphism present in both the baseline and a post-baseline sample whose prevalence in the post-baseline sample is at least 20 percentage points greater than the prevalence in the baseline sample 
[(post-baseline % – baseline %) M 20]
DTreatment-emergent substitution:  A post-baseline substitution or an enriched 
polymorphism.

(include all subtypes).
Analysis 2:   The impact of baseline polymorphisms on treatment outcome will be 
assessed as follows:  for each polymorphism, the SVR
12rate will be calculated for 
subjects with and without the polymorphism and the 2 rates will be compared.  Analysis 
will be grouped by [CONTACT_308158] (NS3/4A or NS5A). 
The following will be included in the analyses of impact of baseline polymorphisms on 
treatment outcome:

If resistance-associated substitutions are not detected in a given target for a subject at the 
time of failure/discontinuation, then that target may not be sequenced in subsequent samples from that subject.
HCV Genotype/Subtype
Phylogenetic analysis will be conducted on HCV NS3/4A and/or NS5A sequence from 
baseline samples from all subjects in order to accurately determine genotype/subtype.  If 
the phylogenetic analysis is not available, then the result from Sanger sequencing of a 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_1077627]'s HCV genotype/subtype, if available.  Finally, if neither the phylogenetic analysis result nor the Sanger sequencing assay results is available, then the Inno-LiPA assay results from the Central laboratory will be used to categorize the subject.  This information will be presented in summaries of efficacy subgroup analyses.
8.1.[ADDRESS_1077628] one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsen s in severity after initiation of study drug

[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs Data
Mean changes in temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and weight 
from baseline to each post-baseline visit, including Final Treatment Visit, will be summarized descriptively.  The number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline values meeting pre-defined criteria for Potentially Clinically Significant (PCS) vital signs values will be summarized.
8.1.[ADDRESS_1077631] and group.  Summary statistics will be computed for each time and visit.  
Plasma concentration data from this study may be combined with data from other studies 
and analyzed using the following general methodology:
Population pharmacokinetic analyses may be performed using the actual sampling time 
relative to dosing.  Population pharmacokinetic models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effect modeling approach (NONMEM) with the NONMEM software (Version VI, or higher version).  The structure of the starting pharmacokinetic model will be based on the pharmacokinetic analysis of data from previous studies.  Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of the PK analytes will be the pharmacokinetic parameters of major interest in the NONMEM analyses.  If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis.  Once an appropriate base pharmacokinetic model (including inter- and intra-subject error structure) is developed, empi[INVESTIGATOR_308112].

Relationship between exposure (noncompartmental or population pharmacokinetic model 
based values of concentrations over time, AUC, C trough or some other appropriate measure 
of exposure) and clinical observations (antiviral activity or virologic end points, such as SVR
12response) will be explored, if appropriate.  Exposure-response relationships for 
primary and secondary efficacy variables and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored.  Exposure response relationships will be explored using a logistic regression analysis and/or a semi-mechanistic viral dynamic model.  Additionally, relationship between exposure and safety endpoints of interest may also be explored.  Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
It is anticipated that approximately 120 HCV GT1 – 6 infected subjects with chronic renal 
impairment, with or without compensated cirrh osis, who are either HCV TN or TE with 
IFN or pegIFN with or without RBV, or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN will be enrolled in the study.  No formal hypothesis is being tested.  If the observed SVR
12rate in 
this study is 97% among 120 HCV GT1 – 6 renally  impaired subjects, then the half-width 
of 2-sided 95% normal approximation interval is 0.031.
8.3 Randomization Methods
This study is not randomized.  Eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study.
9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., adve rtisements used to recruit subjects) and 
any other necessary documents be reviewed by [CONTACT_18369]/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the 
ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or

advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a 
study site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval and approval by 
[CONTACT_243940] (ies), if required by [CONTACT_427], prior to implementation of any changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, maintain and archive study essential documents according to ICH GCP and all other applicable regulatory requirements.
Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by [CONTACT_13125], will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required by [CONTACT_427].  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by [CONTACT_427]) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to [COMPANY_013].
9.[ADDRESS_1077634] of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A .
9.[ADDRESS_1077635] Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by [CONTACT_423], the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]

documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related 
procedures and that the subjec t received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
Pharmacogenetic analysis will only be performed if the subject has voluntarily signed and 
dated a pharmacogenetic informed consent, approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  The pharmacogenetic informed consent must be signed before the pharmacogenetic testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to the pharmacogenetic testing, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study.
In the event a subject withdraws from the main study, optional pharmacogenetic 
exploratory research samples will continue to be stored and analyzed unless the subject specifically withdraws consent for the optional samples.  If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the subject must inform their study doctor, and once [COMPANY_013] is informed, the optional samples will be dest royed.  However, if the subject withdraws 
his/her consent and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data.

Wk = Week; PT D/C = Post-Treatment Discontinuation
a. Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Post-Treatment Period should return to the site to complete the PT D/C Visit pr ocedures.
b. Hematology/Chemistry/Coagulation Panel and Pregnancy Test are only required at PT D/C if subject discontinued prior to PT Wk 4.  Women of childbearing potential do not 
require pregnancy testing beyond PT Wk 4.  Pregnancy testing will be performed at PT D/C visit only if the subject discontinues prior to PT Wk 4.  Pregnancy testing in PT 
Period is not required for females of non-childbearing potential as defined in Inclusion Criterion 2.  Female subjects who are anuric (unable to void) will have serum pregnancy tests performed instead of urine pregnancy tests.

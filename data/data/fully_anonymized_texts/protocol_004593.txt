Title of Study  
Endoscopic ultrasound guided core biopsy needle versus fine 
needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) needle in tissue sampli ng of pancreas 
cancer for whole exome sequencing and genomic profiling: a prospective randomized controlled trial. 
Hypothesis  Flexible core biopsy needles are more capable than fine needle 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_249629].  This would 
specifically allow us to perform whole exome sequencing of a 
tumor tissue and could provide path for future individualized 
pancreas cancer treatment. Thus, we hypothesized that FNB is 
superior to FNA in acquiring tumor tissue from pancreas mass that 
is key for genomic profiling.
 
Specific Aims   To compare FNB versus conventional FNA for whole exome 
sequencing and genomic profiling in tissue sampling of pancreas 
cancer.  
1.Per needle adequacy for  un-amplified whole exome
sequencing
2.Per needle quantity of DNA.
3. Per needle adequacy for cytology
4. Per needle adequacy for histology
5.Adverse events

Inclusion criteria   Male and female patients who are 18 years old or older and are
referred for the evaluation of pancreatic mass lesion
 International Normalized R atio (INR) less than 1.5 and platelet
count of more than 50,000.
 Medically stable to undergo sedation for EUS.
 Signed informed consent
Exclusion criteria   Medical condition that preclude the patient from having a
therapeutic procedure regardless of the EUS finding
 Pregnant patients
Study design   This is a prospective, single blinded randomized controlled trial 
with a paired evaluation of FNB vs FNA for whole exome 
sequencing and genomic profiling. A minimum 2 passes (1 with 
each needle) will be performed from form pancreas stratified by 
[CONTACT_249643] (pancreas head tumor vs pancreas body/tail). 
Based on the location and type of the abnormal lesion, if further 
investigation via FNA is deemed necessary by [CONTACT_249644], conventional FNA will be alternated with FNB  
in the usual f ashion for obtaining histological material.  The 
procedure will be performed with rapid onsite evaluation. Onsite cytopathologist will evaluate the adequacy and the degree of 
pathological changes. Based on the information provided by [CONTACT_249645], the endosonographer will repeat the FNA until 
enough histological material is obtained to confirm a diagnosis. 
Adverse effect of procedure will be assessed immediately after procedure and during the first 30 days with a follow-up phone call. 
Statistical 
analysis For descriptive analyses, continuous variables will be reported as a 
mean ± SD or median (interquartile range) and comparison

1.1 Bac
kground  
Pancreas cancer is a highly fatal disease with a 5 year overall survival is of only 8%1. The 
shorter survival and the poor outcome may be due to late stage presentation, tendency toward 
early metastases and aggressive biologic behavior of pancreas cancer with diverse genetic 
alterations that drive the tumor to early dissemination. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been 
established as a one of the valuable tools for evaluation of pancreatico -billary disease. EUS - 
guided FNA is important for cytological and pathological evaluation of pancreatic cancer. It is minimally invas ive, rapid and accurate for staging and diagnosis of pancreas cancer. The 
overall sensitivity of EUS -FNA is 85% (95% CI, 0.84-.86) and specificity of 98% (95% CI, 
0.97-0.99)
[ADDRESS_303522] been made for molecular diagnosis of pancreas cancer at early stage that would facilitate to 
design a specific chemotherapy preoperatively.  
EUS - guided FNA is not only important for histopathologic characterization of pancreas lesion 
but has also opened the door for genomic analysis of pancreas cancer tissue. Several techniques

sequencing and performing the multiple genetic tests from a small sample of pancreas tumor tissue obtained by [CONTACT_249646]- ultrasound guided fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]
11. 
With the advances in the needle technology to increase the yield of core tissue in addition to cytology, a new needle has been developed termed “Shark Core needle”. The needle has a 
sharpened point in the shape of a fork-t ip that promotes the collection of core sample by [CONTACT_249647] 
a material form the target lesion during to -and fro -movement of the needle. Recently published 
studies have demonstrated its benefit in acquiring adequate core tissue compared to conventional 
FNA n eedle 
12,[ADDRESS_303524] reported the comparison between FNB nee dle “Shark Core” 
and Standard FNA needle for genomic profiling of pancreas cancer. Thus, to facilitate a development of personalized cancer treatment we sought to determine whether the new FNB 
needle “Shark Core” would be capable of performing widespread whole exome sequencing of 
pancreas tissue from FNB specimens. Therefore the main of this study is to compare the DNA 
yield and genomic profiling of pancreas cancer between FNB needle and standard FNA needle.  
   (V
er.1.0) RC NUMBER :    [ADDRESS_303525] comparator is 
based on the recent systematic review of needle devices by [CONTACT_249648]. which concluded “The 
use of a 25-gauge needle is associated with a higher diagnostic yield compared with a 22-gauge 
needle in patients undergoing EUS-FNA of pancreatic masses.”16.  
1.3 Hypothesis  
Hypothesis:   FNB is superior compared to FNA for whole exome sequencing and genomic 
profiling of tissue sampling of pancreas cancer. 
1.4 B
enefit/Risk Aspects  
Procedures used in this study are standard medical practice for the evaluation of lesions within or 
adjacent to the GI tract. The shark core FNB  is an FDA approved device for sampling of 
submucosal lesions, mediastinal masses, lymph nodes and intraperitoneal masses. FNB  was 
introduced as a less invasive alternative to open surgical biopsy.  FNB has been proposed to 
increase the sampling yield and proposed to potentially require fewer needle passes compared to 
conventional FNA . This c ould potentially improve the tissue yield which is measured by [CONTACT_249649]. This will provide significant development for “personalized cancer therapy”.

be asked to sign the consent form to participate in the study.  
Patient registration section of the  “Registration and Data Collection ” form will be completed 
prior to performing FNA  by [CONTACT_093]. At this point, each patient will be assigned with a 
Stand ardized Numerical Identifier (SNI) that will be used for identification and data entry

8.2 St
udy Protocol 
1)Filling the “Pre-Procedure P atient Registration” section of the “Registration and Data
Collection”  form
2) Review of the signed informed consent before the start of procedure.
3)All patients will undergo conscious sedation or Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) for the
duration of the procedure. Conscious section and/or MAC are the standard method ofsedation for all patients that have EUS at our institution, unless contraindicated.
4) Morphologic features of the lesion will be examined and documented in the procedure
report .  Based on the location and type of the lesion, the participating endosonographer
determine s the necessity of performing an FNA. If FNA deemed necessary, the patient will
be included in the study.
   (V
er.1.0) RC NUMBER :    24 5) Randomization of needle order. The first needle to be used will be selected by
[CONTACT_249655] (FNA first, FNB first) by [CONTACT_249656] (1 block for head tumors, 1 block for body/tail tumors).
6) Conventional FNA will be alternated with FNB  (22 gauge for  all sites ) in the usual fashion
for obtaining histological material. A minimum of  2 passes  (1 with each needle) will b e
obtained from all lesions. Conventional FNA will be performed with a standard 25 g needle
(our standard needle) in the usual fashion using back and forth passes for 30 seconds.
Negative pressure will be applied for both needle types using the “capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]” technique of
withdrawing the stylet slowly (5 -10cm per second) during the to and fro movement of the
needle.  All FNA material will be expressed onto a glass slide. Visible c ore samples  will be
removed and placed in formalin after an initial “touch prep” ( light touch of tissue to slide) .
The presence or absence and length (in mm) of grossly visible each core will be recorded by[CONTACT_249657]/study personnel . Standard passes (alternating with each needle) will be
repeated in pairs until an adequate sample is obtained or the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_249632].  Then, a [ADDRESS_303537] set of passes (one with each needle) will be
performed to collect material for biobanking and DNA and RNA extraction. The sample
will be expressed into a sealed biospecimen container  and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen,
then stored at -80C. If no material is obtained, the research pass will be repeated up to a
maximum of 2 passes for each needle.
7) After each pass of needle, the on- site cytotechn ologist will evaluate the adequacy and the
degree of the pathological changes in the obtained material. Based on the information
provided by [CONTACT_249657], the endosonographer will repeat the FNA until enough
material is obtained to confirm the clinical diagnosis. The initial determination of adequacywill be made by [CONTACT_249658]. The final determination of cytological
adequacy will be made by [CONTACT_3979] ( AN) based on the criteria below.
8)Separate sets of slides  and formalin jars wi ll be produced in the GI suite from the tissue
obtained from each type of the needle. Each pass will be placed on separate slides and
   (V
er.1.0) RC NUMBER :    25 formalin jars with labelling (A, B).  9)    In order for the pathologist to remain blinded of the 
needle type that the tissue was obtained with, two separate slide sets will be generated and 
each set will be labeled as “ Slide Set A or B ”. Slides that are prepared from the FN B will be 
labeled as “Slide Set B ” depending on the parity of the assigned SNI number. Slides  that are 
prepared from the conventional FNA needle will be labeled as “Slide Set A ” to comple te 
each pair 10) Pathology interpretation for clinical purposes will be done by [CONTACT_21639]- call 
pathologist of the day, using all material available. For study purposes a single study 
pathologist ( AN) will interpret all of the slides. The pathologist will evaluate the slides for 
cell quantity (adequate vs. scanty/acellular), grade of dysplasia (atypi[INVESTIGATOR_249633]. malignant cells), and presence of core samples .  
11)Each slide set  (A or B) will be ev aluated and reported separately  for research purposes and
accumulatively to generate the patient’s pathology report for medical records.
12)Quarterly , the available data will be reviewed retrospectively and the rate of anticipated
complications will be calculated.  Anticipated complications of EUS with FNA include, but
are not limited to post-procedure pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, and infection. Serious
adverse events  from FNA are rare but  include life threatening event s, inpatient
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249634] a result of the procedure will be reported to Mayo Clinic  IRB.
13) DNA extraction and quantification: One or two biopsy tissues are first digested, then DNA
extractions will be performed using the silica membrane -based column DNA extraction
method with the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit.  This column based extraction method providespurified DNA which is free of protein, nucleases and other contaminants or inhibitors.  This
kit is used for fresh or frozen tissue, cells, and blood.  If larger tissue samples are obtained;
the Puregene DNA extraction will be used and is a salt precipi[INVESTIGATOR_6362].  Tissues are
lysed and DNA is precipi[INVESTIGATOR_249635].  This method allows for purification of high
molecular weight DNA for downstream use.
   (V
er.1.0) RC NUMBER :    26 For DNA quantification, the Trinean DropSense96 spectrophotometer will be used which is 
a multichannel spectrophotometer for quick and precise UV/VIS spectral analysis of 
microliter droplets of DNA.   This method allows for the measurement of total and double 
stranded  DNA as well as purity and quality ratios (A260/280 and A260/230). 
For whole exome sequencing, a minimum of 1.1 ug of DNA is needed (personal communication, Joshua G orman; Department of Laboratory Medicine). Thus for this study 
purpose, 1.1 ug of DNA  will be considered a “sufficient” sample.  Whole exome 
sequencing, using a minimum of 1.1 ug of DNA, sequencing will be performed using 
sequence type: Exome Sure Select v 5 + UTR (71MB) at 50% on target (PE 101 base) on the 
Version [ADDRESS_303538] 5 micrograms of DNA will be evaluated. The WES will be performed in a de -
identified manner and will not be used clinically  for the care of the patient.

This is paired sample study of FNB vs FNA for whole exome sequencing and genomic profiling. 
For descriptive analyses, continuous variables will be reported as a mean ± SD or median

Categorical variables will be reported as frequencies with percentages and compared using chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Two sided P values less than 0.05 will be considered statistical 
   (V
er.1.0) RC NUMBER :    27 significance. Descriptive analysis will be performed in terms of DNA yield per sample, histology 
and cytology y ield per sample. Sample size calculation is done after interim analysis. Sample 
size calculation:  
From our preliminary data from 5 PDAC patients and using the Foundation Medicine adequacy 
criteria, 2 (40%) had an adequate sample of DNA with FNA, while all 5 (100%) patients had adequate DNA with FNB. Although this is a very small sample size it is consistent with the notion that FNB may be much superior to FNA. Based on this preliminary data, it seems reasonable to expect  that the difference in proportions of adequate samples by [CONTACT_249661] 25% or more. Assuming we have 50 patients who all are sampled with both FNA and FNA, then with a McNemar’ s test we will have 80% or higher power to detect a difference in adequacy proportions between FNA and F NB (at the 5%   significance level) of ≥25% if ≤ 38% 
of patients have discordant results for FNA and FNB, or a difference of ≥ 20% if ≤ 25% are discordant. The following are just [ADDRESS_303539] sufficient power with a sample size of 50 pa tients, all of which are consistent with the

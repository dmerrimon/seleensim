1 INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this document is to provide a description of the statistical methods and procedures 
to be implemented for the analysis of data from Gemphire Therapeutics Inc. ("Gemphire"), 
Clinical Trial Protocol GEM-201. This document is based on protocol version 1.0 dated February 
19, 2016. If circumstances arise during the study such that more appropriate analytic procedures 
become available, the statistical analysis plan (SAP) may be revised. Any revisions to the SAP 
(both alternative and additional methods) will be made prior to database lock and reasons for such 
revisions will be described in the final Clinical Study Report (CSR). 
2 OVERVIEW 
2.1 Objectives 
2.1.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple 
doses of gemcabene in patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) on 
stable, lipid-lowering therapy. 
2.1.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives are the following: 
• To confirm the appropriate dose for use in Phase 3 registration studies as assessed by 
[INVESTIGATOR_80009], pharmacokinetic (PK), and safety data (an effective dose is defined as a dose that 
achieves :2::15% mean reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] after 4 
weeks of treatment); 
• To further evaluate the efficacy of gemcabene in patients with HoFH following 4 weeks of 
dosing with gemcabene 300 mg once daily (QD), 4 weeks of dosing with gemcabene 600 
mg QD, and 4 weeks of dosing with gemcabene 900 mg QD, as assessed by [CONTACT_139145], high-density C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and 
fibrinogen; and 
• To evaluate trough plasma concentrations of gemcabene at doses 300 mg, 600 mg, and 
900mg. 
2.1.3 Exploratory Objective 
 
 
2.2 Trial Design 
This is a Phase 2, open-label, dose-finding, 3-period, 3-treatment study using successively 
escalating doses of 300 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg gemcabene in patients with HoFH. All patients 
will be on each of the successive doses for 4 weeks at a time. Patients will remain on their current

CI
stable, lipid-lowering therapy throughout the study. Patients will not be allowed in the study if they 
are undergoing apheresis or taking mipomersen or lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328]. 
The population for this study is male and female patients, years of age, diagnosed with HoFH 
by [CONTACT_139146] a clinical diagnosis based on either (1) a history of an untreated LDL-C 
concentration >500 mg/dL (12.92 mmol/L) together with either appearance of xanthoma before 
10 years of age, or evidence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in both parents or, if 
history is unavailable, (2) LDL-C >300 mg/dL (7.76 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated 
lipid-lowering drug therapy. Approximately [ADDRESS_158062] day of each dose. 
The Follow-up Visit will occur 4 weeks (±3 days) after the last dose of study drug. 
The schedule of events for the trial is provided in Table 1.

a. Study assessments will be completed ±3 days of given time point for all study visits from Day I through Day 70. Day 84 assessments can be performed up to 3 days prior 
to Day 84, but not after Day 84. 
b. The Follow-up Visit will be conducted as a telephone call4 weeks (±3 days) after the last dose of study drug, unless the patient requires a site visit due to an abnormal 
result at Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable) or an ongoing treatment-related adverse event. 
c. Procedures will be performed pre-dose. The Investigator will inquire with the patient at Day I to determine ifthere have been any changes in the patient's health 
affecting eligibility or requiring an update to their medical and surgical history. 
d. A full physical examination includes genitourinary examination per the Investigator's discretion and does not include a rectal examination. Assessment for xanthoma or 
arcus should also be part of the full physical examination. Any changes or improvements in xanthoma or arcus will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. 
e. Only for patients who had an abnormal result at Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable) or an ongoing treatment-related adverse event. 
f. Vital signs include pulse rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and temperature. Blood pressure should be obtained in the seated position, after the patient has rested 
comfortably for at least [ADDRESS_158063] of the study. If an automated assessment is performed, the same machine should be used for the patient throughout the study when 
possible. Care should be taken to ensure an appropriate cuff size is utilized. 
g. Height will be measured only at the Screening Visit. 
h. A urine microscopic examination will be performed when the dipstick result is abnormal (positive for blood, leukocyte esterase, or nitrites). Urine protein:creatinine ratio 
will be performed at the Screening Visit, Day I, Day 28, Day 56, Day 84, the Follow-up Visit (only for patients who had an abnormal result at Day 84 [or the ET Visit, if 
applicable) or an ongoing treatment-related adverse event]), and the ET Visit, if applicable. Urinary NGAL will be measured at Day I, Day 28, Day 84, the Follow-up 
Visit (only for patients who had an abnormal result at Day 84 [or the ET Visit, if applicable] or an ongoing treatment-related adverse event), and the ET Visit, if 
applicable. 
i. For women of child-bearing potential only, a serum pregnancy test will be conducted at the Screening Visit, Day 84, and the ET Visit, if applicable. A urine pregnancy 
test will be conducted at all other study visits, excluding the Follow-up Visit. 
j. Clinically significant abnormal creatinine results at Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable) will also be followed-up 2 weeks (±3 days) after the last dose of study drug in 
addition to the 4 week (±3 days) Follow-up Visit. See Appendix B for a list of analytes and description of when repeat or reflexive testing will be required. 
k. Serology includes HBV, HCV, and HIV. 
I. Includes LDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, TG, HDL-C, and VLDL-C. Fasting will be defined as no food or caloric beverage for at least I [ADDRESS_158064] water. 
m. Includes ApoB, ApoA-I, ApoA-II, ApoC-II, ApoC-III, ApoE, and Lp(a). Fasting will be defined as no food or caloric beverage for at least IO hours prior to sample 
collection. Patients will be permitted to have water. 
n. Patients will be counseled on a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet (NCEP ATP-III guidelines or equivalent). 
o. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected pre-dose (must be 24 ±2 hours from the previous day's dose) and 0.5, I, 2, 3, 5, and I2 hours post-dose on Day 28, Day 56, and 
Day 84 in collection tubes containing K:£DTA as the anticoagulant. For all other study visits where routine plasma drug monitoring will be performed (Day I, Day I4, 
Day 42, Day 70, and the ET Visit, if applicable), samples will be collected pre-dose (must be 24 ±2 hours from the previous day's dose if a previous day's dose occurred). 
The window for PK samples obtained at time intervals <24 hours will be ±IO minutes. 
p. Electrocardiograms will be performed in triplicate and sent to a central reviewer. A I2-lead ECG will be performed at the Screening Visit and pre-dose on Day I, Day I4, 
Day 42, Day 70, and the ET Visit, if applicable. Electrocardiograms will be performed pre-dose and [ADDRESS_158065] dose of study drug (Day I) should be reported as an update to medical history as well as be reported on the appropriate

version ofthe World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Reference List. A listing of all prior and 
concomitant medications including the reported term, preferred term, and Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical (ATC) class, start and stop dates, and other relevant data will be provided for the SP. 
Concomitant medications include all medications taken on or after the date of the first dose of 
study drug. Prior medications include all medications taken before the date of the first dose of 
study drug and discontinued before the first dose of study drug. 
7 ANALYSIS OF EFFICACY 
The following efficacy assessments will be measured in order to obtain the primary, secondary, 
and exploratory endpoints: 
• Fasting LDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, TG, HDL-C, and VLDL-C at baseline, Day 14, Day 28, Day 
42, Day 56, Day 70, and Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable); 
• Fasting ApoB, ApoA-1, ApoA-11, ApoC-11, ApoC-111, ApoE, and Lp(a) at baseline, Day 28, 
Day 56, and Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable); 
• hsCRP at baseline, Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable); 
• Fibrinogen at baseline, Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable); and 
•

Given the proposed crossover design of this study, a within-patient analysis can be performed for 
the comparison of dose groups. For continuous variables, the dose groups will be compared on 
their change and percent reduction from baseline (using their pre-treatment baseline value). For 
binary variables such as the percentage of patients, descriptive statistics will be calculated for each 
dose group. 
Baseline lipid measurements will be defined as the average of the last two fasting measurements 
prior to the first dose of study medication. If only one measurement is available then this 
measurement will be used as baseline. Baseline for all other efficacy variables will be the last 
measurement prior to the first dose of study medication. 
7.[ADDRESS_158076]-squares mean differences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals, separately 
for each of the 3 paired comparisons (300 versus 600 mg, 300 versus 900 mg, and 600 versus 900 
mg) will be provided. 
The mixed-effect model repeated measures analysis will use an unstructured covariance matrix for 
the within-subject correlation; if the model does not converge with this correlation structure, an 
auto-regressive correlation structure will be assumed. If the model still does not converge then 
other covariance structures will be explored. The final correlation structure will be determined by 
[CONTACT_139148]. The data from each scheduled visit will be 
included in the model. Example SAS® code for performing this analysis is as follows: 
PROC MIXED; 
CLASS SUBJID VISIT; 
MODEL PCHG = VISIT; 
REPEATED VISIT I type=UN subject=SUBJID; 
LSMEANS VISIT I cl pdiff; 
RUN; 
In addition, a scatterplot with a linear regression fit of the percent reduction from baseline versus 
dose will be performed. 
7.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Similar summaries and analyses will be carried out for the continuous secondary efficacy 
variables, assessing change from baseline and percent change from baseline in LDL-C (change 
from basline only), non-HDL-C, TC, TG, HDL-C, VLDL-C, ApoB, ApoA-1, ApoA-11, ApoC-11, 
ApoC-111, ApoE, Lp(a), hsCRP, and fibrinogen at each scheduled time point. Sub-group analyses

will be performed for LDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, TG, HDL-C, and VLDL-C, according to receptor 
mutation status. The F AS will also be used for the summary and analysis of the secondary efficacy 
endpoints. 
Descriptive statistics, including the count and percentage, will be obtained for patients achieving 
LDL-C reduction of2::15%, 2::20%,2::25%, and 2::30% at each visit, with the focus being on Day 28, 
Day 56, and Day 84 using the FAS. Similar analyses will be obtained for patients achieving an 
LDL-C value <100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) at Day 28, Day 56, Day 84, and at any time during the 
study.

• Maximum severity of TEAEs, 
• Maximum severity of drug-related TEAEs, 
• All treatment-emergent SAEs, 
• Drug-related treatment-emergent SAEs, 
• Death due to TEAEs, 
• TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and 
• Drug-related TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation. 
The numbers and percentages of patients with TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_139153], by [CONTACT_6654]. For the summaries by [CONTACT_6490], multiple AEs with the same MedDRA preferred term within system organ class from the 
same patient within a given treatment will only be counted once. For overall summaries, multiple 
AEs with the same MedDRA preferred term within system organ class from the same patient will 
only be counted once. The AE onset date will determine the treatment group classification for the 
AE. 
All TEAEs related to study drug, SAEs, and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation will be 
summarized in the same manner. Summaries will also be provided for the numbers and percentages 
of patients by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and maximum severity, for TEAEs and drug-
related TEAEs. 
All AEs will be included in by-patient listings containing additional information of interest such 
as onset and resolution times, maximum severity, causal relationship to study medication, and 
action taken. Specific by-patient listings of SAEs and TEAEs leading to study discontinuation 
will be provided. 
8.3 Safety Laboratory Parameters 
Clinical chemistry, coagulation, hematology, and urinalysis results will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics at all visits with the focus on Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84. Change from 
baseline will also be summarized. Frequency counts of new or worsening abnormalities will also 
be provided. Laboratory values will also be listed by [CONTACT_765], within patient.

• Patient demographics, exposure, and concomitant lipid medications 
• Genetic analysis of HoFH status 
• Primary efficacy parameter ofLDL-C 
• Summary ofLDL-C by [CONTACT_139154] (HoFH status) 
• Adverse events 
11 SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER CONSIDERATIONS 
The primary goal of the study is to assess the mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline over 
12 weeks of treatment from the 3 dose levels. Dosing 8 patients per group will yield reasonable 
precision in estimation in mean change from baseline in LDL-C. 
12 CHANGES FROM PROTOCOL-SPECIFIED STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
It was decided that the Intent-to- Treat (ITT) population defined in the protocol will be renamed as 
the F AS for the analysis. No changes were made to the statistical methodology described in the 
protocol.

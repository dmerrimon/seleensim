      1. Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.  Most opi[INVESTIGATOR_169468]. Adolescence is the time to intervene with prevention interventions (i.e., interventions focused on adolescents who have not yet misused opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) in settings like school-based health centers (HCs), yet few interventions exist that prevent initiation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]. “Serious videogame” interventions can improve health behaviors. They meet adolescents “where they are,” and compared to standard interventions, they can reach large populations, with consistent fidelity, place limited demands on personnel/resources, and facilitate rapid sustainable distribution, all at a potentially lower cost. This study harnesses the power of videogame interventions and incorporates components of effective substance use prevention programs to develop an evidence-informed intervention to prevent the initiation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_169469]. Building on our experience developi[INVESTIGATOR_169470]-Based Health Alliance (SBHA), we will develop and test a new videogame intervention, PlaySmart. PlaySmart will build upon our PlayForward videogame intervention platform that has demonstrated efficacy in improving attitudes and knowledge related to risk behaviors. Through rigorous formative work and with input from adolescents, and our SBHA and game development partners, we will create the PlaySmart videogame intervention. PlaySmart will be designed to provide players with behavioral skills and knowledge through repetitive and engaging videogame play to target adolescent perception of risk of harm from initiating opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) develop the PlaySmart game and implementation strategies through focus groups as part of our formative work; and 2) pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-test the PlaySmart game. We will be working with local schools as well as SBHA stakeholders and partners. The gap in the research on preventing initiation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_169471].

  3. Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.  Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death in those under the age of 50. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), [ADDRESS_197766] the increase of opi[INVESTIGATOR_169474], is that they translate to adolescents. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_169475] 15–19 increased 253% between 1999 and [ZIP_CODE]. Importantly, close to 40% of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_169476] 68% of heroin use starts in adolescence and young adulthood3. Given the importance of this problem to the health and future of our youth, it is imperative to develop and implement effective strategies to prevent the initiation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_169477]. The current situation demands high quality, evidence-informed programs that can be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_169478]. To date, programs created to prevent substance use initiation overall (e.g., alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco) do not have much impact in terms of effectively preventing initiation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]. Further, there is conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of substance use prevention interventions, particularly those conducted in schools where many of these programs are deployed4. Novel ways to reach this highly vulnerable population in settings such as the over 2600 school-based health centers (school-based HCs) are needed.  Videogames as interventions have the advantage of meeting adolescents “where they are.” Over 90% of adolescent boys and girls play videogames5. “Serious games,” defined as games for a primary purpose other than entertainment, have been developed by [CONTACT_169529]6-9. Serious videogames are an ideal prevention platform, facilitating opportunities for repetitive interactions to acquire and rehearse new skills that can transfer to real-life situations10,11. They can reach large populations, with consistent fidelity, place limited demands on personnel/resources, and facilitate rapid sustainable distribution, all at a potentially lower cost. To date, no effective serious videogame interventions to prevent initiation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_169479]. While gaming addiction is a recognized entity, it is very rare and, in the setting of playing a serious game, very unlikely. If there are any concerns of developi[INVESTIGATOR_169480], we have team members who are experts in the field of addiction medicine and will address these issues immediately. We will build on our experience developi[INVESTIGATOR_169481] (R01 HD062080; R41 HD088317, 2R42 HD088317, 5P50 DA036151)6-9,12-[ADDRESS_197767]: Elm City Stories that targets youth HIV prevention7 and PlayForward: smokeSCREEN that targets youth smoking prevention8. We will build the conceptual model19 to promote healthy decision-making using constructs from the theory of planned behavior27, social learning and self- efficacy theories28,29, and principles from message framing30 grounded in prospect theory31 that have been shown to impact prevention. We will focus on antecedents of opi[INVESTIGATOR_169482], intentions, self-efficacy, and initiation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]. This study is consistent with objectives outlined in the proposed National Institute on Drug Abuse 2016-2020 Strategic Plan in that it will “develop and test innovative prevention interventions that target mechanisms underlying risk factors” exploring the “potential of technology- based methods for delivering prevention interventions, such as smartphones, video games, and social media.” It also focuses on the “vulnerability for substance use and related problems…shown to peak during critical life transitions32” as seen in high-risk adolescents.

  Our study’s specific aims are to: 1a: Develop the PlaySmart game through focus groups with up to 40 16-19-year old high school students, focus groups with up to 20 18-25-year-old young adults, interviews with up to 20 16-25-year olds, interviews with up to 20 opi[INVESTIGATOR_169483] 20 stakeholders (educators, prevention specialists, etc.). 1b: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-test PlaySmart with 30 adolescents, using methods from our prior research 13,16,19,20,33 1c: Develop implementation strategies and partners through focus groups with 50 School Based Health Alliance affiliates and 30 adolescents from the Youth Advisory Council.  4. Research Plan: Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical language that can be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. research procedures when applicable and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and lengths. Describe the setting in which the research will take place.  This protocol will be conducted over two years. The outline below highlights the research plan. We will conduct focus groups and interviews to help inform the development of a digital intervention and then evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and usability in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Eight focus groups with five adolescents (n=40), aged 16-19, will be conducted locally over the course of six months. Each group will meet once for approximately 1-1.5 hours after school in a classroom. When the study is introduced to parents/guardians and students, we have always stressed that a stipulation of our studies requires reliable transportation to/from our studies. In certain cases where transportation is not available, we will provide a bus pass.  In addition, we will conduct 4 focus groups with approximately five18-25-year-old young adults (n=20). Each focus group will meet once for approximately 1-1.[ADDRESS_197768] annual focus groups for approximately 1-1.5 hours in a private room at the annual School-Based Health Alliance Convention with 15 participants in the Youth Advisory Council (e.g., high school and college aged) and 25 participants who are school-based health affiliates (i.e., national representatives of school-based health centers who are adults) in June 2020 and June 2021. Since the Youth Advisory Council is part of an existing council within the national organization, we will share the details of the study with this group by [CONTACT_169530]. A representative from the SBHA will email (see email in documents section) members of the Youth Advisory Council up to three times. In the first email, the representative will share details about the study and how to contact [CONTACT_169531]. If the study team is contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], youth will provide verbal assent/consent over the phone. If youth are minors, it will be explicitly stated that parental/guardian verbal consent over the phone is required prior to participation. If email was sent three times and the person did not respond, our team will respect their wishes of not wanting to participate. The Youth Advisory Council is an established group that is part of the SBHA and, therefore, contact [CONTACT_146176]/guardians is common for those who are minors.  In addition, we will aim to conduct up to 20 individual interviews with adolescents and young adults (aged 16-25) who are currently receiving treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]. Interviews will last approximately 60-90 minutes for one session and will be conducted virtually. Some may be asked to provide written stories during interviews if time allows. All writing will be de-identified. Interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_50783]’s research staff. Informed assent will be obtained from participants between the ages of 16-17 in addition to their informed consent from their parent/guardian. Informed consent will be

 obtained from individuals aged 18 and over. Interviews will be audiotaped, and participants will be instructed to not share any identifiable information in the interview. Our goal is to learn from adolescents and young adults who are currently in treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]/opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], their perspectives and stories as well as key aspects, skills, and any other ideas from their views of the past to build out an effective and relatable intervention. For clarification, the purpose of this interview is to learn about their past stories and suggestions related to prevention. These interviews are by [CONTACT_169532]. We will also conduct up to [ADDRESS_197769] approximately 60-90 minutes for one session and will be conducted virtually. Interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_50783]’s research staff. Information sheets will be given to the treatment provider and verbal consent will be obtained. Interviews will be audiotaped, and participants will be instructed to not share any identifiable information in the interview. We will record the audio of the virtual interview. The participants name [CONTACT_169560] a number rather than a name [CONTACT_169561]. Our goal is to learn from treatment providers, their perspective about what should be included in a game that aims to prevent opi[INVESTIGATOR_169469]. In addition, we aim to learn de-identified, generalized stories of patients they treat, in order to inform the storylines and characters of our videogame prevention intervention. Lastly, we will conduct focus groups with up to 20 stakeholders (educators, prevention specialists, etc.) aged of 19-80. Focus groups will be approximately 60-90 minutes in length for one session and will be conducted virtually by [CONTACT_50783]’s research staff. Information sheets will be given to the stakeholders and verbal consent will be obtained. Focus groups will be audio taped and participants will be instructed to not share any identifiable information in the focus group. The audio of the virtual focus group will be recorded. Participants names will not be recorded during the virtual focus group and tapes will be coded by a number to protect confidentiality. Our goal is to learn from stakeholders, perspective on what should be included in a game that aims to prevent opi[INVESTIGATOR_169469]. In addition, we aim to learn development and implementation strategies from these stakeholders. All focus groups and all interviews will be conducted locally. They, along with those at the annual School-Based Health Alliance Convention, will inform the development of this videogame intervention and will be audiotaped. All participants will receive instructions on not using identifiable information (e.g., names, school, peer/colleague names, etc.) while being audiotaped and will be provided a study number prior to the start of audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_169484]. Audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_169485] [ADDRESS_197770]-assessment to measure feasibility, acceptability, and usability. Each participant will complete the pi[INVESTIGATOR_169486]. We will meet with them after school in a classroom (securing room with coordination from our school partners). When the study is introduced to parents/guardians and students, we have always stressed that a stipulation of our studies requires reliable transportation to/from our studies. In certain cases, we will provide a bus pass.  All participants will be assigned a study identification number to link pre/post assessments and to conduct focus groups. Data collection and storage will be conducted according to standardized protocols. The link between participant’s identity and the study number is confidential and will be kept separate from all study data. Research data, such as informed consents/assents, transcriptions, and field notes, is kept in cabinets that are locked except when in use, and access to

Page 6 of 32 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/9/[ADDRESS_197771] participants’ names, school, gender, grade level, age, race, and ethnicity. Names will not be sent to any third parties. Any data shared with NIH or other third-party organizations will be aggregate data. We will collect this information and it will be stored in a secured database.  The Yale University Human Subjects Committee (the committee that reviews, approves, and monitors research on human subjects) may inspect study records. All published results will be group data. Information that will be collected during the focus group interviews will be erased 12 months after the completion of the study and after review of their content has been completed.  1. Formative and development work: (1 year) a.) We will work iteratively with our target audience of 16-19-year old adolescents within schools to develop videogame content, collecting qualitative data for the videogame intervention and refining our logic model with input from 8 focus groups of 5 adolescents each (n=40), aged 16-19 and 4 focus groups of 5 young adults aged 18-25 (n=20). b.) We will aim to conduct up to [ADDRESS_197772] qualitative data for the videogame intervention, and refine our logic model with input from participants. c.) We will aim to conduct up to [ADDRESS_197773] qualitative data for the videogame intervention, and refine our logic model with input from participants. d.) We will aim to conduct focus groups of 5-6 individuals of up to 20 stakeholders (educators, prevention specialists etc.) aged 19-80 to learn about their experiences and recommendations to develop videogame content and refine our logic model. e.) We will create the “Game Playbook” specific to this new PlaySmart intervention. Game Playbooks are our intervention manuals. We create behavior change gameplay manuals to accommodate the specific needs of a multi-disciplinary game development team. The playbooks outline the theoretical foundations and gameplay elements. This ensures targeted theoretical principles and behavior change mechanisms are included in the videogame intervention. f.) We will adapt and refine the current PlayForward Platform to develop the new PlaySmart game intervention by [CONTACT_169533], developed from focus groups and from the substance use prevention literature, for our game development team, Schell Games, to adapt the current platform to develop the new PlaySmart game. g.) While developi[INVESTIGATOR_169487], we will simultaneously be finalizing our assessment measures. This strategy ensures that what we are testing is in the content of the game and that the game provides the information and skill-building that our measures will assess. Once we have finalized our assessment measures, we will have them loaded into REDCap, the Web-based computer system that will be managed by [CONTACT_169534] (YCAS), and this system will be used for data collection, management, and monitoring.  2. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_169488]: (1 year) a.) We will work iteratively to develop videogame content, conducting 8 focus groups of 5 adolescents each (n=40), aged 16-19 and 4 focus groups of 5 young adults each (n=20), aged 18-25 collecting qualitative data for the videogame intervention and to refine our logic model. b.) Working with our community school partners, we will engage 1-2 schools and school-

We will pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-test the intervention with [ADDRESS_197775] data (both qualitative and quantitative) after the completion of game play sessions. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_169489]. For the in person segment of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], all COVID-[ADDRESS_197776] at our partner school site will be followed. d.) We will also pi[INVESTIGATOR_169490]. e.) We will develop a game implementation manual that will be used during the subsequent RCT, as needed, by [CONTACT_169535]-based health center staff. f.) As part of our focus groups with school-based health affiliates, we will collect focus group data for our formative and development of a videogame intervention from the Youth Advisory Council (n=15) and School-based health affiliates (n=25) at the annual School-Based Health Alliance Convention. This includes data on implementation strategies such as barriers and facilitators and to share perceptions of the newly created game and provide input on the game implementation manual. This will take place at the annual School-Based Health Alliance Convention with our national partners who will help recruit participants for the Youth Advisory Council and School-Based Health Alliance. They will assist in recruitment to create two focus groups: 1) youth and college- aged adults in the Youth Advisory Council (i.e., an already established group), 2) members who are affiliated with school-based health centers. We will conduct focus groups for approximately 1-1.5 hours once per year for two years in a private room at the Convention with up to 15 participants in the Youth Advisory Council (e.g., high school- and college-aged-participants) and 25 participants who are school-based health affiliates (i.e., national representatives of school-based health centers who are adults) in June [ADDRESS_197777] of sending out flyers via email and making announcements via email to all involved in the Youth Advisory Council as well as making an announcement to those who are affiliated with the School-Based Health Alliance via the School-Based Health Alliance listserv before the Convention. For this reason, they will be prepared to participate before they arrive at the Convention.  5. Genetic Testing N/A ☒ A.

Subject Population: Provide a detailed description of the types of human subjects who will be recruited into this study.  The subject population for this project is adolescents between the ages of 16-19. Young adults aged 18-25 will be recruited for focus groups as well. There are also adults (19-80) that will be recruited to participate in separate focus groups at the Convention.  For this study, 8 focus groups of 5 adolescents each (n = 40), boys and girls in Connecticut, aged 16-19 will participate in the focus groups and 30 adolescents, boys and girls, aged 16-19 will participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_169491] ( 2 groups of 3 adolescents will participate virtually and 6 groups of 4 adolescents each will participate in person at their school site while following COVID-19 guidelines). These adolescents will be recruited from the high schools that we already have established partnerships with, such as Maloney High and Hamden High. In addition, we will conduct 4 focus groups of young adults aged 18-25 (N=20) in Connecticut. These young adults will be recruited from local universities. Additionally, 30 youth (16-19) over the course of two years (e.g., meeting annually) from the national School-Based Health Alliance (SBHA) National Convention will also be recruited to participate in focus groups for the project.  For the focus groups with the adults, 50 adults (19-80) who are affiliates of the SBHA will be recruited over the course of two years (e.g., meeting annually) during the national SBHA Convention to participate in the project and will receive information sheets. Their role represents various positions within school-based health centers across the nation. Their role in this study is to be part of our focus groups to help inform game development and implementation strategies.

 For the individual interviews with adolescents and young adults who are currently in treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]: Upon expressing interest, phone screens will be conducted by [CONTACT_169537]. The phone screen will verify that the participant is between the ages of 16- 25, receiving treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], a device to access the internet for the virtual interview, and is able to sit for 60-[ADDRESS_197783] to help build out an effective and relatable intervention.  For treatment providers: Upon expressing interest, phone/ email screens will be conducted by [CONTACT_169538] a treatment provider and has treated individuals aged 16-[ADDRESS_197784] 5 years. Participants will be recruited through clinical directors at their APT Foundation site as well as via email and from snowball sampling from other providers that participate in the interviews.. The purpose of this study will be to learn about their experiences treating individuals for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD), any stories they are willing to share and their opi[INVESTIGATOR_169493] a videogame that aims to prevention opi[INVESTIGATOR_169469].  For stakeholders: Upon expressing interest, our team will verify that the individual is aged 19-80 and holds a position that enables them to provide insight to our study (e.g. an educator to our target population, prevention specialist, etc.). Participants will be recruited through partnerships (FCD Prevention Works, First Book, etc.). The purpose of this study is to gather stakeholder’s perspectives on what should be included in a game that aims to prevent opi[INVESTIGATOR_169469]. In addition, we aim to learn development and implementation strategies.  Participation in this study will be strictly voluntary, confidential, and non-discriminatory. Participants will be enrolled either on-site or virtually during their first meeting. The study team will enroll adolescents, aged 16-19 years (grades 9-12) from schools with school-based health centers. In partnership with school-based health centers, we will provide flyers and announcements to the general population of students via school meetings and physical education/health classes. In collaboration with community program staff, we will discuss the study with interested adolescents and parents/guardians (for those participants ages 16-17) and collect eligibility screening data. In describing the study to the participant, the purpose of the study will be described as “finding out how kids can make choices and decisions that are healthier for them.” It is important to note that this part of the study is NOT about engaging youth who already misuse opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]; the focus of this part of study is on prevention. In describing the study to the parent/guardian, we will indicate that the study will focus on promoting healthy behaviors in adolescents, and on providing strategies to assist adolescents in making decisions about the many challenges they face during adolescence, including the risks associated with drug misuse. If the participant is eligible and interested, we will proceed with the consent procedures. On separate occasions, we will give information sheets to the adolescents and to their parents describing the purpose of and protocol for the focus groups and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-testing depending on the stage of study. For participants under age 18, parents/guardians who do not wish for their teens to participate may contact [CONTACT_169539]/or protocol.

It is anticipated that the adolescents enrolled in this study should benefit directly from the study as the purpose of the study is to facilitate increasing their perception of risk of harm from initiating the misuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], decreasing their actual misuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], as well as improving their decision making and knowledge to optimize their abilities to negotiate around risky behaviors. The potential benefits to participants are great while strict precautions are being taken to protect the confidentiality and well- being of participants, as has been described above. Thus, the potential benefits to the participants outweigh the potential risks.  10. Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.  This study presents minimal risks to the participants and adverse events or other problems are not anticipated.  Adverse Events (AEs): Violation of confidentiality: Any breach of confidentiality. Discomfort due to assessment procedures: Discomfort created by [CONTACT_169540]. Embarrassment in disclosing sensitive personal information. Disclosure of information about current and/or intended physical harm to persons; current and/or intended abuse of children that would be reported to a child welfare agency; and/or an investigation of such allegations(s) that could ensue. Dissatisfaction with the intervention activities: In this case it would be the game intervention. While gaming addiction is a recognized entity, it is very rare and, in the setting of playing a serious game, very unlikely. If there are any concerns of developi[INVESTIGATOR_169480], we have team members who are experts in the field of addiction medicine and will address these issues immediately.  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs):

 SAEs include death, life threatening injury or condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], persistent or significant disability/incapacity, and other conditions which in the judgment of the investigators represent significant hazards. In the rare evident of an SAE, we do not expect them to be related to our study.  Procedures for research team management of AEs, SAEs and other study risks such as mandatory reporting requirements:  This study presents minimal risks to the participants and adverse events or other problems are not anticipated. In the unlikely event that such events occur, Reportable Adverse Events (which are events that are serious or life-threatening and unanticipated (or anticipated but occurring with a greater frequency than expected) and possibly, probably, or definitely related) or unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be reported in writing within 48 hours to the IRB (using the appropriate forms from the website) and the NIDA PO. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_169495]. We will use procedures to detect and respond to adverse events that ensure prompt discovery of any adverse events and to minimize their effects. There is adequate surveillance and protections to discover adverse events promptly and keep their effects minimal.  Procedures for training and supervision of all research personnel have been developed as part of our previous and current studies. All members of the research team are familiar with procedures for identifying and reporting possible adverse reactions. All members of the research team are trained in mandatory reporting and will notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_169496] (suicidality), substance use, abuse of any kind, and so forth. If an adverse event occurs study personnel will notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_169497] (ISO) and follow all necessary procedures. All adverse events are reported using the Yale Institutional Review Board (IRB) standard template for reporting adverse events. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_169498], classifies the attribution of adverse events (e.g., definitely, probably, possibly related; unlikely or unrelated) and grades the severity of the event, utilizing the FDA’s definition of serious adverse events, on a 6-point scale (0=no adverse event or within normal limit; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe; 4=life-threatening; 5=fatal). Serious unanticipated or anticipated adverse events will be reported immediately to the IRB and to the NIDA PO within 24 hours by [CONTACT_17084]/or email and will submit a written report to the PO no more than two days later. Adverse events will be reported in summary form at least annually to the IRB. The summary will include the number of participants enrolled and a summary of graded adverse events to date, using the chart format included in the Yale University DSMP template. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_169499]/Benefit ratio of the study and whether modifications to the protocol (e.g., Risks to Subjects) or consent form (e.g., Risks and Inconveniences) are required.

Player Game State Data allows us to monitor the progression of the player through the game. The Activity Logging Data allows us to see the decisions the player makes throughout the game. This system is outlined here: 1. After receiving an unidentifiable, unique User ID and password from the research staff, each player logs in to the web-based game through a Chrome or Safari web browser on an iPad. The game is accessible only through our secured online server. 2. During each game play session, Player Game State Data and Activity Logging Data is automatically collected within the game and is exported and stored on the secured online server. Data will not be collected or stored locally on iPads and will only be accessible from the secured online server, which will be password protected and only accessible by [CONTACT_16133]. 3. After each session is completed, the research staff will ensure each player is logged out oftheir unique game, will generate specific log files for each unique playsession. 4. The data will remain on the secured online server until all player game play sessions are complete, at which time the players' data will be downloaded as a single .csv file for optimization reasons and transferred securely to the Yale shared drive until the time data analysis isinitiated.    Videogame data collection security:  Personal identifying information is never kept on the secured online server and care is taken to ensure that none of the game data is put at unnecessary risk of being distributed to unauthorized people. iPads will always be in the possession of authorized personnel and locked in safes designed for iPads when not in use or in the possession of study participants (players) under the supervision of authorized personnel. Player Game State Data and Activity Logging Data are stored as unencrypted plaintext data. At the end of all players' game play sessions, data will be transferred over Yale's secure network, and not on the public Internet. The saved game data files belong to Yale and are only accessible by [CONTACT_3462].  Data entry methods:  All data is entered by [CONTACT_169549]. All data is entered directly into the web-based computer system, Redcap. All data entry will be completed with assigned ID numbers only.

All research staff participating in the study will be required to complete training in research ethics. Data collection forms will be designated by [CONTACT_169552]. A separate master file of names, addresses, contact [CONTACT_122473], and telephone numbers, along with the study ID numbers will be maintained in a locked file cabinet in the PI’s research offices. All data entry and analyses will be completed with ID numbers only. The study will be explained to others, such as the parent/guardian and program staff as a study of child development that will focus on promoting healthy behaviors. In instances in which data are requested from other sources or it is beneficial to the participant to provide information to another individual or agency (e.g. medical personnel) this will only be done with the written permission of the parent/guardian on a “Release of Information” form stipulating who the information is provided to, or received from. The research staff will follow standard confidentiality procedures for research programs.  Any breaches of confidentiality will be reported immediately to the participant, their family, and relevant school personnel as well as the IRB and the NIDA PO as well as the HIPAA Privacy officer. Additional systems will then be instituted to prevent a similar breach from occurring.   5. What will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy the identifiable data? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_22467]. If no, describe how the data and/or identifiers will be secured.

It is anticipated that the young adolescents enrolled in this study should benefit directly from the study as the purpose of the study is to improve their attitudes, intentions, and knowledge, and decision- making around health promotion and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. This research has the potential to benefit a large number of youth around the country and worldwide, because if in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_169510], then this intervention can be replicated elsewhere and with a greater ease of dissemination. The potential benefits to participants are great and strict precautions are being taken to protect the confidentiality and well-being of participants, as has been described above. Thus, the potential benefits to the participants outweigh the potential risks.  1. Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research?  No participation in the study  2. Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to subjects, the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation.  Each participant (adolescents and young adults) will receive a $[ADDRESS_197793] for participating in the game development focus group.  Each participant will receive a $[ADDRESS_197794] for participating in the individual interviews conducted with adolescents and young adults who are currently in treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427].  Each participant will receive a $[ADDRESS_197795] 5 years.  Participants in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_169511] a $[ADDRESS_197796] for one two-hour gameplay session and follow-up questions (in person) OR two gift cards totaling $60 for six one hour gameplay sessions and follow-up questions (virtually).  Focus group participants from the national Youth Advisory group will receive $35 for their participation. Because this will be happening during a conference, we added a $5 incentive to participate in the focus group.  School-based health center affiliates will receive $35 for participation in their respective focus group. Because this will be happening during a conference, we added a $5 incentive to participate in the focus group.  Stakeholder focus group participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_197797] for their participation.  3. Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs associated with participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost to subjects.  No costs to participants will be incurred for participating in any part of this study.  In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk, and for minimal risk research

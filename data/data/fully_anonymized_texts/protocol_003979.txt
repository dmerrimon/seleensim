STUDY PURPOSE AND RATIONALE  
Study Purpose   
The overall goal of this study  is to develop and to preliminar ily validate a novel intervention  delivered by 
[CONTACT_21108] (PCPs) to their Black adult patients with uncontrolled asthma in federally qualified 
health centers (FQHCs). We recently developed and rigorously tested a brief questionnaire, the Conventio nal 
and Alternative Management for Asthma (CAM -A) tool1,2, that screens patients for beliefs about asthma self -
care and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment and prompts PCPs to discuss ICS adherence at office visits 
based on personalized patient CAM -A responses3. In over 300 adults (80% Black; 67% uninsured or 
government -insured)  with high  rates of uncontrolled asthma (69%), the validated CAM -A identified that 
erroneous personal health beliefs and negative ICS beliefs were commonly endorsed (93% and 68%, 
respectively)1. Importantly, erroneous p ersonal health beliefs were significantly associated with uncontrolled 
asthma, likely driven by [CONTACT_52402] -adherence.  In this feasibility trial w e will develop the intervention by [CONTACT_52403] -based brief shared  decision -making strategy with proven efficacy4-6, for use with our validated 
CAM -A tool using community -based participatory research and delivered by [CONTACT_21111].  As such, t his project has 
three specific aims : 
Specific Aims:  
1. To develop an intervention to improve asthma control in Black adults receiving care in FQHCs;   
2. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention procedures; and  
3. To assess the preliminary evidence of intervention effects on asthma control ( primary outcome), 
ICS adherence, forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_31737] (FEV 1) – an objective lung function 
measure – and asthma quality of life (secondary outcomes) over a 3 -month follow -up period.  
 
Please note, at this time we are submitting  for IRB approval for Aim #1 (Phase I  - focus group and PCP 
review  only), which will  be carried out in Study Year #1 . Aims #2 and #3 (Phase II -pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393] ) will 
be conducted later;  as we develop /refine  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_52394] s #2 and #3.  
 
Background  / Rationale  
Uncontrolled asthma due to ICS non-adherence is common  among Black adults . Nearly every asthma -
related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21064] -management that achieves and 
maintains disease control7-10. However, as many as 64% of adults have uncontrolled asthma11; minorities are 
disproportionately represented within that population12. While inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are a safe and 
effective treatment for uncontrolled asthma, relat ive to Whites, Blacks have lower rates of ICS adherence (74% 
vs. 29%)13-17.  
 
Health beliefs are associated with ICS non -adherence. Erroneous personal beliefs about asthma and its 
pharmacologic treatment are among the most significant factors contributing to ICS non -adherence18-21. ICS 
non-adherence, a primary cause of uncontrolled and/or fatal asthma7, is lower in Black s relative to Whites13-17 
due, in part, to higher rates of erroneous personal health beliefs regarding asthma self -care1 (e.g., coffee is a 
safe, effective asthma treatment) and negative ICS beliefs13-15,22 -29 (e.g., ICS is addicting). These beliefs have 
been shown to be associated with ICS non -adherence22,23,27, more asthma attacks22,30 and delays in seeking 
care23. 
Version #1; 0 9-21-2016                                                                                                                      Page 3 of 8 
  
There are unique challenges to achieving asthma control in FQHCs.  PCPs  deliver up to 80% of asthma 
care. However, compared to specialists, uncontrolled asthma is more common in their patients31. There are 
unique challenges t o achieving asthma control in FQHCs a particular type of primary care setting designated to 
receive enhanced Medicaid reimbursement because their clientele are underserved, underinsured, and uninsured 
Americans who  receive more epi[INVESTIGATOR_21065]32. In these settings PCPs have limited time to evaluate 
asthma control, to assess ICS non -adherence, and to identify beliefs associated with ICS non -adherence33. This 
speaks to the pressing need for novel brief interventions that facilitate evidence -based guideline -directed asthma 
self-management.  
 
Shared decision -making interventions to promote asthma control in this v ulnerable population are 
lacking. The study is guided by [CONTACT_52404] -Making in ev idence -based practice34, 
which posits that the best treatment decisions are informed by [CONTACT_4676] ’s preferences, the best available evidence, 
and pr actitioner expertise. The PCP’s role is to facilitate discussion of the risks and merits associated with 
specific options in the context of patient ’s goals and preferences, and in a manner that activates patients to 
engage in self -management. PCPs offer options to consider jointly35 with the goal of reconciling d ifferences  and 
reaching mutually agreed upon higher quality decisions that align patients’ needs with evidence -based 
guideline -directed care36,37. Prior research has demonstrated that with repeated lengthy engagement  (1+ hour), 
highly -trained interventionists in settings other than primary care  can increase medication adherence38-40, this 
interv ention model improves disease control39,41-43, identifies health beliefs that conflict with evidence -based 
care44 and reduces risky behaviors4-6. The framework’s application to asthma has been limited to children39,[ADDRESS_55595] formative assessments with the target 
audience and program providers during development, and evaluate the p rogram features that enhance a 
program’s reach.  Further, FQHCs are overlooked i n asthma intervention research.  
 
Impact . Black adults with uncontrolled asthma experience profound health disparities.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_21066] -management, we continue to see rates of controlled asthma well 
below Healthy People 2020 targe ts48, particularly among vulnerable populations49. Our Brief Evaluation of 
Asthma Therapy (BREATHE)  intervention  has the potential to offer a new avenue to asthma control via 
shared decision -making that supports ICS adherence.  
STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES  
This R21 proposal will proceed in two major phases: (1) a development phase  (Year 1) where BREATHE is 
developed using iterative community -based participatory research ( CBPR ) approaches with feedback from 
PCPs; and (2) a pi[INVESTIGATOR_52395]  (end of  Year 1 and Year 2) that will allow estimation of parameters 
crucial for a larger randomized control trial ( RCT ) including final content specification, participant recruitment 
rates, and potential intervention effect sizes.  
PHASE I ONLY   
Development Phase.  While the final intervention content will be determined by [CONTACT_52405], their family/support person, PCPs and our Patient Advocate, based on our collective 
clinical and research experiences1-3,5,6,13,23,24,[ADDRESS_55596] of 
one-time, brief (7 -minute), tailored shared decision -making intervention session using motivation interviewing

 to address personal health beliefs and negative ICS beliefs  associated with ICS non -adherence (see manual 
attached -Brief intervention adapted for asthma ). To adapt BREATHE , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_52396] a 2 -step process.  
Study Procedures  
PHASE I ONLY  Step 1. CBPR with Adults with Persistent Asthma  and their Family/Support Person to 
Adapt Intervention Content . We will conduct up to 6 focus groups composed of ~10 participants each: (a) 
two groups of only adults with persistent asthma ; (b) two groups of only family/support persons of adults with 
persistent asthma  unique from group a; and (c) two combined groups of adults with persistent asthma  and/or 
their family/support persons who did not participate in group a or b.  
Participants wil l be recruited from the partner FQHCs. These are Spectrum Health Services (SHS) and Greater 
Philadelphia Health Alliance (GPHA). Letters of support for this project are attached to this application.  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_52397] t heory approaches, collecting qualitative data using an 
open -ended interview guide adapted from our preliminary studies1-6,13,23,24,50 -54  to obtain suggestions for  
responses PCPs will use with patients who endorse CAM -A beliefs associated with uncontrolled  asthma. 
Responses will be used to design the brief intervention. Focus groups will be audiotaped and transcribed 
verbatim. A member of the rese arch team will take field noted.  
Step 2.  PCP Review . We will further refine the intervention prior to pi[INVESTIGATOR_52398]; we chose not to use PCPs from 
our partnering FQHCs in order to avoid contamination. PCPs  will provide input into the application of the 
intervention to their practice, which we will use to revise the intervention.  
 
STATISTICAL PROCEDURES      
 
Qualitative analysis . Qualitative data analysis will focus on developi[INVESTIGATOR_52399]. De -identi fied 
transcripts will be entered into NVivo 11.0 for coding and analysis. Three coders working independent ly of 
each other will systematically read the transcripts to identify emerging themes;  the Patient Advocate consultant  
will serve as one coder. Themes  will be compared between coders and disagreements will be reconciled by 
[CONTACT_21128]. As we have done in the past, we will employ an iterative process in which themes from the initial 
focus groups will be presented to subsequent focus groups to ascertain if they resonate with that group; 
unendorsed themes will be discarded. This iterative process will continue until no new essential information is 
obtained, an endpoint known as data saturation. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_52400] (e.g., patient, family/support person) are held55; we have over -estimated by [CONTACT_52406] [ADDRESS_55597] reached data saturation with fewer focus groups we will end this 
phase of data collection. All retained re sponses that are similar will be grouped together by [CONTACT_52407]. Transcripts, field notes and codes will serve as points of triangulation.  
 
MEASURES  
Immediately prior to the focus groups, but after obtaining HIPAA and informed consent, we will administer 
surveys. These can be found under separate attachment.

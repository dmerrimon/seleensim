[  ]  Abbreviated Submission - This information is included in an attached stand-alone protocol. Proceed to the next
question
 At least 25% of Americans over the age of [ADDRESS_368163] type 2 diabetes (T2D), which, in addition to its well-recognized
complications, is accompanied by a high fracture risk, particularly in elderly patients. Importantly, these fractures are
associated with worse outcomes than fractures in the general population. Standard explanations, namely low bone mass
and high bone turnover, do not explain how T2D adversely impacts the aging skeleton. Rather, low bone turnover,
specifically reduced formation of new bone, likely predisposes to a high fracture risk. This is compounded by [CONTACT_301392]. Both etiologies –
reduced bone formation and altered bone material properties – are increasingly thought to arise from the accumulation of
advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Hence, preventing the accumulation of AGEs in bone tissue in T2D patients is a
potential therapeutic strategy with likely effects in reversing bone fragility in T2D.      In fact, there is currently no
therapeutic agent that addresses the specific skeletal abnormalities in T2D. And, while anti-resorptive agents, such as
bisphosphonates, have been utilized widely, there is no prospective clinical trial data for fracture efficacy. Furthermore,
these latter drugs suppress bone turnover, and would seem contrary to the requirement for increased bone formation.
There is thus a critical need for an effective therapeutic intervention that could lengthen the healthy, active years of life in
older T2D individuals. One novel intervention directed to the etiologic culprit, AGE, is pyridoxamine, a naturally occurring
and structurally distinct metabolite of vitamin B6 pyridoxal phosphate. Preclinical data show that pyridoxamine has
specific molecular features which provide a unique multi-pronged effect to inhibit glycation reactions and the formation of
AGEs. Pyridoxamine is also a potent inhibitor of AGE accumulation and improves bone material properties in diabetic
animals. Notably, while it also reduces AGEs in patients with T2D with nephropathy, there are no clinical data on possible
 skeletal benefits in T2D.      Our overarching goal is to reduce fracture risk in older patients with T2D. The specific
objective of this application is to determine whether, in a short intervention study, pyridoxamine reverses bone fragility in
patients with T2D, and to use this pi[INVESTIGATOR_301370] a foundation for larger and longer fracture studies. Our preliminary
data show strong correlations between AGE accumulation and both bone formation and bone material properties (Furst 
et al. JCEM, 2016: PMCID: 4891790).  Namely, we have shown that skin autofluorescence (SAF), a marker for tissue
AGE accumulation, correlates strongly with decreased bone formation. Likewise, using a novel impact microindentation
device that provides an in vivo index of cortical bone material properties, namely bone material strength index (BMSi), we
show that older T2D women have increased AGE accumulation and decreased BMSi. Furthermore, T2D women with the
lowest pyridoxamine stores had the highest SAFs and lowest bone formation and BMSi. Together, these data underscore
our central hypothesis: that pyridoxamine treatment in older T2D patients will increase bone formation and bone
material strength by [CONTACT_301393].  If the resulting findings of pyridoxamine’s skeletal benefits in
T2D are translated clinically, a novel and much-needed therapeutic approach is likely to emerge that should
reduce fractures in aging T2D patients.       Towards examining the effect of pyridoximine on bone formation and
material properties, we will conduct a randomized, double-bind clinical study, comprising two specific aims.  In Specific
Aim 1, we will study the effect of pyridoxamine on the formation of new bone in older T2D patients.  For this, we will treat
52 women over 65 years of age with T2D with pyridoximine or placebo, and measure bone turnover markers, namely
P1NP (bone formation) and TRAP-5b (bone resorption), and skin autofluorescence (SAF), a marker for AGE

10/02/[ADDRESS_368164] that the proposed studies will identify positive effects of pyridoxamine on bone
formation and bone material strength in older T2D patients and that the data will support an AGE-mediated mechanism
for bone fragility in T2D. The findings will also define a new role for over-the-counter vitamin B6 in skeletal homeostasis. If
it is confirmed that pyridoxine does improve bone formation and/or bone material properties, this data set will form the
framework for large scale testing to advance the development of pyridoxamine as a therapeutic agent specifically for
diabetic bone fragility. In this way, this project could have a positive impact on the large and ever growing population of
elderly type [ADDRESS_368165] a 40-50% increase in the risk of hip fracture. In the general
population, 20% of hip fracture patients die within one year and more than half never regain functional independence.
Post-fracture complications are also worse in T2D. Notably, a cohort study with >1 million patients found an increased
complication risk in hip fracture patients with T2D, with a 27% increase in mortality (95% CI 1.02–1.60). Thus, it is our
premise that healthy active years of life can be extended by [CONTACT_301394] T2D.      Studies with extended
follow-up and rigorous fracture adjudication show that skeletal fragility in diabetes occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_301371] (aBMD) and high body mass index (BMI), and is not explained by [CONTACT_301395]. In contrast
to the increased levels of bone turnover markers noted in postmenopausal osteoporosis, we and others find reduced
bone turnover in T2D.  That fracture risk is increased in T2D, despi[INVESTIGATOR_301372],
implicates other etiologies, such as abnormal bone material properties and/or bone microarchitecture.  Although
increased cortical porosity has been reported using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, we do
not find evidence of this deficit. Likewise, a large (n=1057) bone microarchitecture study has failed to document increased
cortical porosity in T2D. Nonetheless, a rigorously designed study by [CONTACT_301396]. of T2D postmenopausal women using
impact microindentation (IMI) has provided evidence for compromised bone matrix properties, measured as bone material
strength index (BMSi). Although most IMI studies are limited by [CONTACT_12783]-sectional designs, they show that BMSi
discriminates between those with or without osteoporosis-related fractures, and importantly, independent of a BMD. As
noted below, we posit that increased advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) contribute, at least in part, to the noted
decreases in BMSi, and that skin AGE levels serve as a valid surrogate for bone AGE accumulation. We have therefore
extended the work of Farr et al. to show that longer duration of T2D and higher skin AGEs are associated with reduced
bone material strength and bone formation (Furst et al. JCEM, 2016: PMCID: 4891790). We hypothesize that reducing
AGEs will improve bone formation and bone material strength in older T2D patients and, in doing so, reduce
fracture risk.   Free-floating sugars in prolonged hyperglycemia interact with exposed amino acid residues on collagen
resulting in a reversible Amadori intermediate that undergoes oxidation to form irreversible AGEs. Excess AGEs
compromise bone formation by [CONTACT_301397], cell attachment to the
collagen matrix, and collagen and mineral deposition. Low bone formation, in turn, further increases AGEs, perpetuating a
vicious cycle. Our data confirm that bone formation is reduced in T2D. Notably, histomorphometric indices of bone
formation, namely bone formation rate and osteoblast numbers, as well as serum levels of the bone formation marker
procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) are lower in postmenopausal T2D women (Manavalan et al. JCEM,
 2012; PMCID: 3431571). Bone resorption, likely due to coupling with formation, is also reduced. Relevant to our
hypothesis, there is a strong correlation (r=-0.63, P=0.01) between reduced bone formation (low P1NP) and increased
skin AGEs (skin autofluorescence, SAF) in T2D, whereas no associations are seen in controls.

      To study whether lowering AGE accumulation in bone will improve bone formation and reduce bone fragility in T2D,
we propose to utilize a metabolite of vitamin B6, pyridoxamine. Prospective cohort studies, albeit limited in scope, support
this notion. The Rotterdam Study showed that lower B6 intakes were associated with a higher fracture risk25. Likewise,
the Framingham Osteoporosis Study reported that lower B6 levels were associated with higher bone loss and hip
fractures. In preclinical studies, pyridoxamine is a potent AGE inhibitor possessing specific molecular features that are not
present in other B6 isoforms (pyridoxal and pyridoxol). Based on a pyridine ring structure, with OH, CH3, NH2 and CH2OH
 substituents, pyridoxamine is unique in inhibiting AGE formation (Fig. 1). Voziyan and others showed that the OH at
position 3 and NH2 group at position 4 of its ring endow pyridoxamine with a unique triple mechanism of action: (i)
inhibition of AGE formation by [CONTACT_301398], thus blocking oxidative degradation of the Amadori
intermediate of the Maillard reaction; (ii) direct scavenging of toxic carbonyl products of glucose and lipid degradation;
and (iii) trappi[INVESTIGATOR_301373]. While rodent models show that pyridoxamine inhibits AGE-mediated
diabetes complications, including diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy, clinical data are scant. In a phase II study in
patients with diabetic nephropathy, pyridoxamine reduced plasma AGE levels over [ADDRESS_368166] hoc analysis, serum creatinine
levels also decreased by ~48% (P =0.03). A prospective randomized study of pyridoxamine for [ADDRESS_368167] therefore used serum pyridoxal levels as a
surrogate for circulating pyridoxamine, and find, in 6 patients with T2D, a strong correlation between serum pyridoxal and
the bone formation marker P1NP (r=0.79, P=0.06). These data further support our working hypothesis that
pyridoxamine increases bone formation in older T2D patients by [CONTACT_301399]
(Fig. 2).
      In addition to a direct action on osteoblastic bone formation, AGEs impair bone biomaterial properties with an
eventual negative effect on bone strength. The sharp increase in bone pentosidine, a key AGE, in insulin-deficient
diabetic rats is associated with a lower femoral bending stiffness versus wild type littermates, despi[INVESTIGATOR_301374]. Likewise, in our mouse model of type 1 diabetes (T1D), the increase in bone AGE content was correlated inversely
with bone toughness (Rubin et al. PLoS One, 2016; PMCID: 4854398). A relationship between AGEs and bone strength
has also been established in a small clinical study in which trabecular bone from fracturing T1D patients exhibited higher
pentosidine levels than non-fracturing T1D or controls. These correlations have not been observed in T2D, apart from our
preliminary studies. Notably, in older patients with T2D, we find a strong inverse correlation between AGEs and BMSi (r=-
0.65, P=0.006). Thus, we hypothesize that the inhibition of new AGE formation by [CONTACT_301400]. Our preliminary data in 6 older T2D
women show that serum pyridoxal (pyridoxamine) levels tend to be lower in patients with the lowest BMSis (r=0.71, PFig. 1. Pyridoxamine. The functional
groups inhibit AGE accumulation.

=0.1) and highest skin AGEs (r =-0.67, P=0.1). Together, these data suggest that pyridoxamine correlates with bone
material properties in diabetes, specifically via AGE accumulation.

question
 In a small cohort of 6 patients with T2D, we find a strong correlation between serum pyridoxal levels (a
surrogate for pyridoxamine) and the bone formation marker P1NP (r=0.79, P=0.06).  We will therefore test
the working hypothesis that pyridoxamine increases bone formation by [CONTACT_301401].  For this, we will use an interventional protocol to determine whether pyridoxamine alters bone
formation in older T2D patients.  Our overall approach will be to compare the change in bone formation in
response to pyridoxamine vs. placebo given for [ADDRESS_368168] that those with milder T2D and lower AGEs will
display a greater response magnitude.  These results should provide preliminary data for future studies on
the potential use of pyridoxamine as a specific therapeutic for diabetic bone fragility.Study Protocol: We will
compare the effect of pyridoxamine dihydrochloride (200 mg po bid) (n=26) vs. identical placebo (n=26) in a 1
year double-blind randomized study of older postmenopausal T2D. This dose is available over-the-counter and is
safe and effective at lowering serum AGEs in T2D patients. Study drug (HPLC-certified content, see Appendix)
and placebo will be supplied by [CONTACT_301402]. A neurological safety evaluation will be performed per
 visit for the unlikely onset of vitamin B6 neurotoxicity (see Human Subjects). Our Research Pharmacy will
randomize patients with a block scheme stratifying for race. We will not stratify for baseline vitamin B6 levels
because they are not expected to modify the response to pyridoxamine,. In addition to evaluating P1NP, serum 
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP-5b) levels will be measured as a surrogate for bone resorption.
AGE levels will be determined using our skin autofluorescence (SAF) protocol, with authentication in a sub-set
(n=10) by [CONTACT_301403].Patient Recruitment: Participants will be recruited from Medicine and
Endocrinology clinics at Columbia, where >1,000 T2D outpatients are seen annually with 60% of local residents carrying
a diagnosis of T2D. We will also recruit from 2 satellite locations in Washington Heights and Riverdale, where >2,[ADDRESS_368169] used these populations to recruit >100 T2D in prior studies (Furst et al. JCEM, 2016:
PMCID: 4891790). [CONTACT_301441] (Co-I) will support recruitment.  Her clinic sees ~15 postmenopausal T2D patients every
week; these patients are mostly hospi[INVESTIGATOR_301375].  Based on these resources,
we do not foresee any difficulty in recruiting 52 patients within 6 months.  d.   Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: We will
include postmenopausal women (n=52) 65 years with T2D who meet ADA criteria (HbA1c 6.5%). African Americans, in
whom T2D is common, will be included (n=4/group). In addition to exclusions noted in Table 1 (which can be seen
attached), certain specific considerations apply.  First, and importantly, we will not screen for serum pyridoxamine as 
levels are very low (~10 nM) in those not on pyridoxamine supplementation and are thus unlikely to predict response to
therapy.  Of note is that, with supplementation, levels increase to ~[ADDRESS_368170], low vitamin D (serum 25OHD <30 ng/dl) can be exclusionary as
it is often low in T2D and can be a confounder. Although the IOM threshold is <20 ng/dl, our higher cut-off will avoid any
possibility of deficiency.  However, if the subject's vitamin D level results are less than 20ng/ml and they meet all other
criteria, the investigator will prescribe 50,[ADDRESS_368171] will be re-

10/02/[ADDRESS_368172]. Adolfo Diez-Perez, a leader in the
technique of microindentation.  Finally, insulin users will not be excluded because even though insulin has been
implicated in increasing fracture risk, it is probably not due to insulin itself, but rather due to the disease or comorbidities.
Potential Sources of Biological Variation: We will control for known age-associated bone changes (see Statistical
Analysis). We will also restrict our study to postmenopausal women in view of our preliminary data, and because
including men in a relatively small cohort will only increase heterogeneity.  Moreover, postmenopausal women are at
higher fracture risk and thus might be more likely to display a pyridoxamine treatment benefit on fractures numerically
even in a small cohort.  We will include T2D men in an extended cohort in a future R01 application.  Little is known about
the influence of race on the mechanisms of diabetic bone fragility. We will thus assess our outcomes separately and in
combination with race to assess group differences (see Statistical Analysis). Variables related to fracture risk, such as
nephropathy; years since menopause; nutrient intake; weight; weight bearing exercise; and sun exposure will be treated
as confounders.Patient Visits: At the screening visit, we will assess demographics and covariates using a 
questionnaire [footnote[1]]. We will obtain an AM fasting metabolic panel (BMP) with liver function, HbA1c and 25-
hydroxyvitamin D. BMP and HbA1c are measured by [CONTACT_301404] (Cobas Integra 400 Plus); 25-hydroxyvitamin D
is measured by [CONTACT_301405] 6430 (intra- and inter-assay variability <10%). Patients meeting criteria will undergo
randomization, where we will measure bone mineral density (BMD) by a dual energy X-ray absorptiometer (DXA) using
standard protocols within a month of the screening visit (Table 2).
     At each subsequent study visit as seen in (Table 2):randomization/baseline (0b), month 1 (M1), month 6 (M6), month
9 (M9) and month 12 (M12), we will measure serum intact P1NP by [CONTACT_243359] (IDS; intra- and inter-assay
variability <10%). Note that considering that stage I-II CKD may be present, it would be important to measure intact
P1NP, which represents the trimeric form that is not renally cleared. TRAP-5b will be quantified by [CONTACT_6428] (IDS; intra- and
inter-assay variability of 10%). TRAP-5b is selected because it is an enzyme derived from osteoclasts and unlike serum
C-telopeptide (derived from collagen) will not be affected by [CONTACT_301406], the
screening,(0b), M12 visits, we will measure Skin Autofluorescence (SAF), which we and others have shown is highly
reproducible.  Notably, this new technique effectively measures tissue AGE accumulation and has been validated against
direct AGE measurements including pentosidine levels in skin. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_301376] (Furst et al. JCEM, 2016: PMCID: 4891790). SAF is measured with the AGE Reader
(DiagnOptics Technologies BV).Preliminary Validation of AGE Testing: Extrapolating from skin to bone may be
imprecise, as skin collagen has a longer half-life than bone collagen and glycated skin proteins might be absent in bone. 
 Therefore, prior to randomization, we will perform a preliminary corroboration of our SAF technique with direct
measurement of AGEs in bone biopsies in a randomly selected, albeit small, sub-set of Caucasian patients with high (2.6;
n=5) or low (2.0; n=5) SAF levels. We have not proposed biopsies for all subjects because of invasiveness, time and cost.
The biopsy AGE assay will precisely quantify the degree of collagen glycation with a fluorometric assay that is routinely
used by [CONTACT_301407], [CONTACT_301442] (Professor of Biomedical Engineering, RPI; see Letter). Cortical and
cancellous compartments will be analyzed separately because of known compartment differences in glycation.  The PI
[INVESTIGATOR_301377]-standing experience in obtaining biopsies and our collaborator is a leading expert in measurement of bone
glycation.  Power Calculations: Assuming our preliminary findings, mean ± SD P1NP of 51.2 ± 16.2 in healthy
controls and 38.4 ± 9.8 in T2D, a standardized difference of 0.95-SD, and 80% power, a 1%  and an analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) where covariates have a correlation with outcome of r = 0.50, normalization of P1NP at 1-
year requires [ADDRESS_368173] an adjusted 95% confidence interval surrounding the
between group difference in means of ± 4.99 for a minimum detectable 13% increase in P1NP in the T2D. We propose to
increase enrollment by 6 subjects per group to both enroll minority subjects (n=4/g) and for potential attrition (n=2/g).
Between treatment group differences in minority enrollees will be an exploratory analysis to provide estimates for future

 Briefly, data will be reviewed for accuracy, completeness and assumptions held for categorical variables and
distributional characteristics of continuous variables. Transformations will be applied prior to inferential testing as
necessary to achieve normal distributions. The pattern of missing data will be examined and, if found to be missing
completely at random or missing at random, the fully conditional specification multiple imputation method of Van Burren50
.  The primary outcome is the 1-year change in the P1NP marker of bone formation and the primary intent-to-treat
analysis is a one-way ANCOVA with fixed effect of treatment (treated vs. placebo), and baseline P1NP as a continuous
covariate. Secondary outcomes of TRAP-5b and SAF will be analyzed in similar ANCOVA models with P-value
adjustment for multiple endpoint comparisons. Exploratory analyses will employ linear mixed models for repeated
measures to estimate the between treatment group difference in the temporal course of change in P1NP, TRAP-5b and
SAF with fixed effect of treatment, time (baseline, 1, 6, 9 and 12-months), random effects for subject and the baseline
value of the outcome, and a covariance structure chosen by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_301378]. The influence of
additional theoretical confounders will be explored in this model: age, duration of T2D, diabetes complications and
baseline DXA. Predictors of the change in P1NP in the pyridoxamine-treated group will be estimated using multiple linear
regression to identify variables that track or lead changes in P1NP. Bone collagen glycation differences in the subset of
randomly selected high and low SAF patients at baseline will be assessed by T-test and, although underpowered, an
intraclass correlation coefficient calculated to quantify agreement between bone and skin AGE content. Expected
Outcomes and Data Interpretation: We expect that P1NP levels will increase with pyridoxamine at 1, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_368174] AGEs6 leads to a similar
expectation. It is thus anticipated that lower baseline SAF levels (known to be associated with shorter T2D duration, fewer
T2D complications and higher baseline P1NP levels) will predict a greater increase in P1NP with pyridoxamine. Also, as
noted with other agents, such as teriparatide51, serum TRAP-5b levels are also expected to increase because of the
coupling between bone formation and bone resorption.  We do not anticipate baseline BMD to predict change in P1NP,
as it does not relate to bone formation levels or SAF in our preliminary data (Furst et al. JCEM, 2016: PMCID: 4891790)6. 
 A decline in SAF is also expected with pyridoxamine; however, this may not be detectable by [ADDRESS_368175] of pyridoxamine to increase bone formation via an AGE-inhibiting mechanism. This sets the
stage for reversing diabetes-specific skeletal deficits, which until now has not been possible with approved osteoporosis
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].1Covariates for Questionnaire: age; race; duration of T2D; co-morbidities including hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy,

NOTE: Be sure to detail all of the procedures above to which a "yes" response was selected. Also detail any
additional procedures that may or may not fall into the categories listed above.
 
1) DXA will be performed twice. This will be done at Baseline visit and M12. This is a testing of bone mineral density.
2) 6 tubes (about ten teaspoons) of fasting blood will be collected during the screening from subjects and controls to
measure:
calcium, glucose, HgbA1c, creatinine, 25hydroxyvitamin D, and bone turnover marker
(TRAP-5b).  At screening visit, baseline, M1, M6, M9, and M12, we will draw 3 tubes of blood (about five teaspoons) to
measure P1NP (a marker of bone formation) and TRAP-5b (a bone turnover marker reflective of osteoclast activity).
3) 1 tube of serum blood samples will be collected from all African American subjects and all controls (random sample)
to measure blood pentosidine levels.
Either during the screening, randomization, or M12 visits, the following will be studied:
4)A measure advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) in the skin will be made using a noninvasive measurement of
skin autofluorescence (SAF), a method based on the fluorescent properties of AGEs. We will perform this test at,
screening, baseline and at M12.  Participants will be asked not to use any sunscreen within [ADDRESS_368179] in a seated position. The forearm of a participant will be positioned on top of the device. SAF will be
measured with the AGE Reader (DiagnOptics Technologies BV). The AGE Reader is a desktop device that uses the
characteristic fluorescent properties of certain AGEs to estimate the level of AGE accumulation in the skin. The AGE
Reader illuminates approximately 4cm2 of the skin (which is guarded against surrounding light) with an excitation light
source of 300-420nm (peak excitation 350nm). Autofluorescence is then calculated by [CONTACT_301410] 420- to 600-nm range by [CONTACT_301411] 300- to
420-nm range. Control measurements will first be obtained with the lights off, autofluorescence of the skin will then be
measured six times (every 10 seconds) at the volar side of the arm, approximately 10mc below the elbow fold. This
procedure involves no risk to the subject and is completely noninvasive.
5) Transiliac percutaneous bone biopsy will be performed in a total of 10 subjects for assessment of bone structure,
IRB-AAAR5451 Page 13 of
30
10/02/2019
bone metabolism and quantification of advanced glycation end products in collagen. An additional separate consent
form will be used for the bone biopsy. Participants who undergo the bone biopsy will be compensated $250.
6) Reference Point Indentation via a microindentation at the midshaft of the anterior tibia will be performed for
assessment of bone material strength (BMS) in a minimally invasive approach that uses a hand-held probe
(OsteoProbe®) to obtain indentation measurements of bone. We will perform this procedure at baseline and at M12.
The procedure will be performed in an exam room under sterile conditions. 2% lidocaine will be used as a local
anesthetic. The lidocaine will be administered by [ADDRESS_368180]
learned how to use lidocaine injections as part of their general medical training (medical school and internal medicine
residency). Additionally, [CONTACT_301441], one of the study physicians, met with [CONTACT_301443]-Perez, the investigator who
has pi[INVESTIGATOR_301381]. He reviewed the procedure
in detail with [CONTACT_301441] and she observed the actual procedures with him. Secondly, we have both successfully used
the tool in research protocol AAAE1078. The probe will be held perpendicular to the tibia as the leg is flat against the
exam table and will be inserted through the soft tissue and periosteum until it reaches the bone surface. The
indentation occurs via trigger mechanism and takes 0.25ms. The size of the indentation is quite small, about 187m,
which is approximately the width of 1-2 human hairs. The measurement obtained from this procedure is known as the
IDI (Indentation Distance Increase) and will be converted by a computer to BMS. In order to obtain accurate results,
there will be [ADDRESS_368181] proper accountability, handling, and storage of the OsteoProbe®.
We will get one shipment which will include the device and the probes once the study is approved. The probes will be
discarded in sharps disposal bins (red bins). The OsteoProbe® handheld device and the individual probes will be
received by [CONTACT_079]. There will only be one OsteoProbe® device from the company that will be sent
to CUMC one time in the beginning of the study. The probes themselves will come individually packaged with a lot
number that we will record for each subject. Each subject will also be assigned a subject number consisting of first
initial-last initial and three digit study number (ie 001). The probes will be single use and will be discarded in a sharps
disposal bin (red bin) located at the site of the procedure. Devices will be handled only by [CONTACT_301412], Drs. Starr and Rubin. We will receive
one probe per subject so the probes will be discarded after each use. While the probes are clean, they are not sterile
so we will sterilize them with steam autoclaving, which will be performed through [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_301382]. The OsteoProbe® itself will be cleaned before
and after each use with alcohol prep pads.
The OsteoProbe® will be stored at room temperature in a carrying case that has a built-in soft pouch to protect the
device from damage. The probes will be stored at room temperature. The carrying case and the OsteoProbe® will be
kept in a locked office that only the study personnel will have access to. The probes will be used one time per subjects
and will be placed into sharps disposal bins available in the exam rooms where the microindentation is to be
performed.

Device description:
The osteoProbe® is a stainless steel handheld device slightly larger than a highlighter with three component parts: an
impact generation mechanism, a displacement transducer and a probe. The probe has a tip diameter of approximately
375m and a tip sharpness radius of less than 10m. The operator uses one hand to press the device through the skin at
the anterior tibia until it sinks slightly into the bone. At this point, the instrument is full compressed and this causes the
impact.

Research Question(s)/Hypothesis(es):
 Specific Aim 1: Study the effect of pyridoxamine on the formation of new bone in older T2D patientsWe will
compare the change in bone formation in response to pyridoxamine vs. placebo given for [ADDRESS_368187] that those
with milder T2D and lower AGEs will display a greater response magnitude.  These results should provide
preliminary data for future studies on the potential use of pyridoxamine as a specific therapeutic for diabetic
bone fragility.Specific Aim 2: Identify the effect of pyridoxamine on bone material strength in older
T2D patients. We hypothesize that, by [CONTACT_301421], pyridoxamine as an
intervention will reverse the deterioration of cortical bone material strength, a characteristic feature of
diabetic bone fragility. To determine whether pyridoxamine given to older T2D patients positively affects
bone material properties and strength, we will compare, as in Specific Aim 1, pyridoxamine vs. placebo
given for [ADDRESS_368188]:Research Aims & Abstracts
IRB-AAAR5451 Page 22 of

10/02/[ADDRESS_368189] 25% of Americans over the age of [ADDRESS_368190] type 2 diabetes (T2D), which, in addition to its well-
recognized complications, is accompanied by a high fracture risk, particularly in elderly patients.  Standard
explanations, namely low bone mass and high bone turnover, do not explain how T2D adversely impacts
the aging skeleton. Rather, low bone turnover, specifically reduced formation of new bone, likely
predisposes to a high fracture risk. This is compounded by [CONTACT_301422]. Both etiologies – reduced bone formation
and altered bone material properties – are increasingly thought to arise from the accumulation of advanced
glycation endproducts (AGEs). Hence, preventing the accumulation of AGEs in bone tissue in T2D patients
is a potential therapeutic strategy with likely effects in reversing bone fragility in T2D. Our preliminary data
show strong correlations between AGE accumulation and both bone formation and bone material properties
 (Furst et al. JCEM, 2016: PMCID: 4891790, IRB protocol AAAE1078).One novel intervention directed to
the etiologic culprit, AGE, is pyridoxamine, a naturally occurring and structurally distinct metabolite of
vitamin B6 pyridoxal phosphate. Preclinical data show that pyridoxamine has specific molecular features
which provide a unique multi-pronged effect to inhibit glycation reactions and the formation of AGEs.
Pyridoxamine is also a potent inhibitor of AGE accumulation and improves bone material properties in
diabetic animals.  Notably, while it also reduces AGEs in patients with T2D with nephropathy, there are no
clinical data on possible skeletal benefits in T2D. Our study will explore the changes in bone formation,
bone material strength and AGE accumulation over a one-year period during which a subset of
postmenopausal women with T2D will be treated with pyridoxamine.  This study has important ramifications
for offering a novel treatment to preserve or improve skeletal health in postmenopausal women with T2D.
  
Lay Abstract:
 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) has become one of the most important diseases of our time. 
Recent research shows that diabetes has negative effects on bones and that people with diabetes
might be more likely to break a bone.  We don't know the reasons for this, but we suspect that
normal bone replacement is slowed down in diabetes and this could slow down the growth of new
bone.  It is possible that the normal bone material becomes weaker because sugar-related
components ("Advanced Glycation Endproducts") are making the bone more brittle.  We have
shown in past research that people who have type [ADDRESS_368191] both weaker
bone with lower "bone material strength" and also higher levels of sugar-related components
("Advanced Glycation Endproducts").  This study will focus on attempting to lower the sugar-
related components ("Advanced Glycation Endproducts") by [CONTACT_125908] a group of patients with type
[ADDRESS_368192] and a
measurement of sugar-related components in the skin.  This study will help to clarify if using
pyridoxamine helps improve bone strength in women with diabetes.
 
 
Abbreviated Submission:
The IRB has an abbreviated submission process for multicenter studies supported by [CONTACT_301390] (e.g., ACTG, HVTN, NCI oncology group studies, etc.), and other studies that have a complete
stand-alone protocol. The process requires completion of all Rascal fields that provide information regardingRisks, Benefits & Monitoring

local implementation of the study. However, entering study information into all of the relevant Rascal fields is not
required, as the Columbia IRBs will rely on the attached stand-alone (e.g., sponsor's) protocol for review of the
overall objectives. .
If you select the Abbreviated Submission checkbox and a section is not covered by [CONTACT_301391]-alone
protocol, you will need to go back and provide this information in your submission. 
  
Potential Risks:
Provide information regarding all risks to participants that are directly related to participation in this protocol,
including any potential for a breach of confidentiality. Risks associated with any of the items described in the
Procedures section of this submission should be outlined here if they are not captured in a stand-alone protocol.
Risks of procedures that individuals would be exposed to regardless of whether they choose to participate in this
research need not be detailed in this section, unless evaluation of those risks is the focus of this research. When
applicable, the likelihood of certain risks should be explained and data on risks that have been encountered in
past studies should be provided.
[  ]  Abbreviated Submission - This information is included in an attached stand-alone protocol. Proceed to the next
question
Potential risks of study participation include venipuncture, radiation exposure from DXA, impact
microindentation and the bone biopsy. The skin autofluorescence protocol does not involve risk.
Venipuncture: Risks include pain, bleeding, bruising, infection and inflammation at the site. The
risks of venipuncture will be minimized by [CONTACT_301423], experienced professional staff to obtain
all blood samples.Radiation: Each patient will have 2 DXA exam. The radiation exposure for DXA
(spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], one hip and forearm) using the Hologic QDR4500 (fast scan) is 14.[ADDRESS_368193] flight. The total radiation exposure
is less than the same relative risk as <[ADDRESS_368194] micoindentation: The procedure causes minimal
discomfort (only during the local anesthesia injection) and no complications have been observed to
date. Patients who have a significant skin disorder, bruising, local edema, or infection, as well as
those undergoing treatment for blood clots or severe coagulation defects will be excluded.Bone
biopsy: In 10 randomly selected Caucasian patients with high (2.6; n=5) and low (2.0; n=5) skin
autofluorescence levels, bone biopsies will be performed prior to randomization. The biopsy
advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) assay will precisely quantify the degree of collagen
glycation in the cancellous and cortical compartments with a fluorometric assay. The risks of bone
biopsy includes the risks of conscious sedation and the risks of the biopsy itself. Conscious
sedation will be offered to subjects who have a bone biopsy in order to minimize anxiety, provide
pain relief and diminish recall. Patients receiving conscious sedation may have brief transient loss
of protective reflexes. Risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_301424]. Specifically, all nurses and
physicians involved in performing bone biopsies will have certification in Basic Life Support and
Advanced Cardiac Life Support. The procedure will be conducted in an outpatient surgery suite,
which has a stocked "crash cart"; vital signs (including O2 saturation) will be monitored at regular
intervals during and after the procedure.  Complications from the biopsy itself are very unusual, but
could include cutaneous nerve entrapment, bleeding, fracture of the iliac wing and prolonged
IRB-AAAR5451 Page 24 of

10/02/[ADDRESS_368195]. More commonly, there will be a bruise at the
site or discomfort that persists for only a few days. Close follow-up by [CONTACT_301425].Administration of pyridoxamine dihydrochloride: 
Pyridoxamine dihydrochloride will be administered at a dose of [ADDRESS_368196] considered the safety of our regimen. Excessive ingestion of vitamin B6
(pyridoxine) when used as a dietary supplement at doses up to 2 g/day has been reported to
cause a neurotoxic syndrome in patients as characterized by [CONTACT_227790], muscle weakness and
numbness 1.  In contrast, no neurological or behavioral signs of toxicity have been reported, to the
best of our knowledge, following administration of pyridoxamine dihydrochloride. In a large (n=317)
clinical trial of pyridoxamine, doses that are similar (150 mg po bid and 300 mg po bid, for 52
weeks) to our planned dose of 200 mg po bid for 52 weeks were used 2. In that study, there was
no association between pyridoxamine and serious adverse events.  Recently, administration of up
to 200 mg/kg/day in Sprague-Dawley rats of pyridoxamine dihydrochloride via IV infusion for seven
consecutive days was not associated with any treatment-related findings including gross or
microscopic findings in the nervous system (brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], spi[INVESTIGATOR_301383]/ganglia, and
peripheral nerves), liver, kidneys, heart, spleen, thymus, pancreas, or the catheter emptying site.
Based on those data, the no observed adverse effect level in Sprague-Dawley rats was
determined to be 200 mg/kg/day 3. To address the unlikely issue of vitamin B6 neurotoxicity, at
each study visit neurological symptoms will be reviewed and a full neurologic exam will be
performed. Any neurologic findings will be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor and will be
reviewed with the Data Safety and Monitoring Board.1. Dalton K, Dalton MJ. Characteristics of

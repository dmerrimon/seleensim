SUMMARY 
 
 
 
 
Title: Internet Surveys and their Impact on Adherence to Brimonidine topi[INVESTIGATOR_654613] : Wake Forest University Health Sciences  
 
Objective: 
Primary  Objective: To assess adh erence to topi [INVESTIGATOR_654614], 0.33%  for the 
treatment of rosacea.  
Secondary Objectives: To determine  the impact of reported adherence on rosacea 
outcom es, to identi fy factors that  affect adh erence to ros acea treatment and to assess Q OL. 
 
Study  Design: 
 
An investig ator-blind ed, prospective, [ADDRESS_878512]-of-care brimonidin e topi[INVESTIGATOR_34600], 0.33% with instru ctions  
to apply it once daily per package insert. Adherence will be assess ed using weekly internet 
surveys to document  how o ften the medi cation is being used,  as well as reminders about 
rosacea triggers and general use of brimonidine.  
 
Patients with persistent er ythem a associat e d with  rosacea will be recruited from the 
Wake Forest Baptist H ealth Dermatology Clinics and IRB approved advertisin g. At the 
baseline screening visit, subj ects will have the diagnosis  of rosacea confirmed  by [CONTACT_654626]. Patients will be classifi ed as having erythem atotelangiectatic or a 
combin ation erythematotel angiectatic and papulopustul ar. We will evaluate  whether patients 
believe they have constant erythema  or more int ermitt ent flushing  and blushin g. Subje cts 
will be informed of the benefits and risks  of treatment. If they agree to particip ate, the 
subjects will give written  consent approved by [CONTACT_423644] R eview  Board and will be  
seen in fol low up at 3 months and 6 months.  
 
Subje cts will be randomized 1:1 to be in the weekly internet survey group (appendix) or 
the stand ard care non-survey group. The internet survey will ask them  how often they 
have used their  medi cation that week, as well as giving them treatment tips and remind ers 
about rosacea trig gers. They will be asked a variety of questions during  the weekly internet 
survey- such as the amount  of erythema they currently have (measured by [CONTACT_595558]), 
how much  burni ng and stinging they have, how often they have used the medi cation 
and where did they apply the medi cation, as well as any additional  side effects they

At each visit,  review  of the internet survey use and medi cation weights will be 
done. Dise ase severity measures ((Clinici an’s Erythema Assessment (CEA ), 
Patient Severity Assessment (PSA, Lesion counts )) will be obtain ed. Investigator 
and subject Visu al Analog Scale (VAS) to measure facial erythema will be 
obtained. Adverse events will be logged at every visit.  Attention  will be paid 
to any symptoms  of r ebound  erythema  and more detailed  information 
concerning location and timing  will be  collected. QOL surve ys will be  compl eted 
at the end of  study visit.

[ADDRESS_878514] ay of rosacea treatment; however patients often 
continue  to suffer from rosacea after being prescribed a treatment; poor adherence 
likely plays a role in poor  treatment outcom es. Non-adherence is a patient’s 
failure to follow a medication re gimen as directed by [CONTACT_099]. In many 
cases, non-adherence, rather  than non- response, is the  underlying cause of 
treatment failure. 
 
 
 
 
Brimonidine  is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_654615]. Some  patients have noticed some  rebound  flushing  when using the 
medication. This r aises the question  about adherence to the medication in the 
setting of adverse effects. The  general thought is that there is a relationship  
between adverse effects from medi cations  and treatment adherence- the more  often 
side effects occur the less often a medi cation may be taken. However that is not 
always the case. Many patients take medi cations  such as isotretinoin  and topi[INVESTIGATOR_654616]. Yet adherence to these  medi cations  
is often very good.  So do any adverse effects from b rimon idine affect patient  
adherence? 
 
 
 
 
Return office visits  are used to follow  treatment complian ce and adherence. An 
online surv ey may provide  an effective and more p ractical alternative to an extra 
office visit as a method to measure and promote  improved adherence. Internet 
surveys may improve intrinsic  motivation  to take medi cation by [CONTACT_654627], enhancing a trusting  patient-physician relationship. A  good deal of 
real time  information can be obt ained through an internet survey.

are not limited to,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (applied to the skin)  antibiotic  treatments, 
such as clindamycin, o ral antibioti cs such as cephalexin, and the  use 
of antibacterial so aps.

as indi cated by [CONTACT_30597], symptoms,  and/or clinically 
significant labo ratory abnorm alities that are consid ered product-
related. This d efinition  includ es: intercurrent illness; injuries; 
exacerbation of pre- existing  conditions  (excluding rosacea) ; adverse 
events occurring as a result of product withdr awal, abuse,  or 
overdose; and a change in a laboratory variable if consid ered by [CONTACT_654632] (or 
should  have caused)  the clinici an to reduce or discontinue  the use  of 
the product or institute  therapy.  This definition  does not include  
inpatient  or outpatient  elective surgery for a condition  that was 
present prior to the start of the trial and which has not worsened 
unexpectedly during  the trial. 
  
To capture any adverse events related to rosacea, changes in lesion 
counts, papules and telangiectasia will be captured in the lesion count 
assessments. If a subject has an increase in visible papules (once t he 
erythema is improved with the study drug), then this will be captured 
as an AE if a concomitant medication is added.  
 
The investig ator will monitor  the occurrence of adverse events 
during the course  of the study. The investig ator must  provide  to the 
Sponsor appropriate information concerning any findi ngs that 
suggest significant h azards, contraindications, side effects or 
precautions  pertinent to the safety of the  study. 
 
All adverse events occurring after the Baseline visit must  be 
recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form page. 
 
 
 
 
5.3 Serious Adverse Ev ents 
 
1. Definition  An adverse event is co nsidered a serious adverse 
event (SAE)  if it: 
 
1. Is fatal  
2. is life  threatening (i.e., results in an immedi ate risk of 
death); 
3. is persistent ly or significantly disabling/incapacitating; 
WFUHS Dept of Dermatology 
Winston-Salem, NC   
12 
  
4. results in, or p rolongs, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543]; 
 
5. results in a congenital anoma ly; 
 
6. is an event which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_654619]/Medi cal 
Monitor,  may jeopardize  the subject and may require  medi cal or 
surgical intervention  to prevent one  of the outcom es listed  in 
this s ection. 
 
The definition  of an SAE  encompass es both known  and 
unexpected events. 
 
2. Recording and Repo rting Obligations for  SAEs  
 
The investig ator will provide  the IRB  appropriate information  
concerning any findin gs that suggest the re has been an SAE  
related to the study drug. Any adverse event that  is consid ered 
serious  must  be reported within  one working day 
(IMME DIATELY) to the IRB .  Serious  adverse events 
(regardless of relationship)  must  also be reported to FDA. Clinic al 
judgment  should  be exercised in deciding wh ether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situ ations. Impor tant medi cal 
events that may not be immedi ately life- threatening, results in 
death, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_654620] p atient or may 
require  intervention  to prevent one of the outcom es listed  
above, should  also be considered serious  and reported to the 
sponsors.  
 
 
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_878523] medical 
events ( as defined in Section 5.2 above) will be document ed as 
Adverse Events throu gh the 6 Mo visit.  Any adverse events not 
resolved  by [CONTACT_941] 6 Mo visit and consid ered to be potential ly related 
to the study medi cation will be follow ed as clinically indicated until 
their resolution or, if non-resolvi ng, until conside red stable. 
 
5.5 Confid ential ity 
 
All information  provided by [CONTACT_654633]/initi al will replace  particip ant

once baseline erythema has cleared and the patient  desires treatment for the papules, a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588] (such as metronidazole) may be added per standard of care. This should 
help with s ubject retention over the course of the study while not interfering with the 
overall objective of the study to measure adherence to brimonidine.

Sample Internet Survey: 
The above  is a sa mple of the appearance of the internet surv ey sent  to subjects. For this 
Rosa cea study we would ask the following questions:  
How  many days did  you apply the Brimonidine  this week?  
How  well did it cont rol the  redness: 
Compl etely, moder ately, slightly, not at all, redness is wo rse 
If worse, are the areas of worsening: 
 check at that apply: new areas, old areas that w ere already red.  
When did the  worsening occur:  
           When the m edication w as applied? After missing one  or more doses? 
 
Are you usi ng the m edication re gularly or only as needed? 
Have you had any side e ffects: If so what?

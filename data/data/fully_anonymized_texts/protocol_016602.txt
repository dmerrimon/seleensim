1.2 Synopsis
[COMPANY_013] Inc. Protocol Number:   M12-895
Name [CONTACT_26323]:   Veliparib (ABT-888) Phase of Development:   Phase 2
Name [CONTACT_3261]:   Not applicable Date of Protocol Synopsis:   07 June 2019
Protocol Title:
A Randomized, Phase [ADDRESS_1025971] Cancer
Objectives:   The primary objective of the study is to assess the progression-free survival (PFS) of oral 
veliparib in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel compared to placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in subjects with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.
The secondary objectives of the study are to assess overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR), 
objective response rate (ORR) in those subjects treated with veliparib in combination with TMZ or treated with veliparib plus carboplatin and paclitaxel versus placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel.  Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) (as assessed by [CONTACT_20368]-CIPN20 questionnaire and NCI-CTCAE 4.0 grading for peripheral neuropathy) will be assessed in those subjects 
treated with veliparib plus carboplatin and paclitaxel versus placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel.
The tertiary objectives are to assess Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
and quality of life (QoL) and to assess exploratory correlative endpoints.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 120
Study Population:   Men and women ≥ [ADDRESS_1025972] cancer and a documented BRCA1 or BRCA2 deleterious germline mutation.  If human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2) positive, the subject must have received and progressed on at least one prior standard HER2-directed therapy or the subject must be ineligible to receive anti-HER2 therapy.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 290 (including approximately 4 subjects enrolled 
under the original protocol)
Methodology:   This is a Phase 2, randomized, partially blinded, multinational, multicenter study to 
evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of veliparib in combination with TMZ or veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel compared to placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in subjects with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deleterious mutation and locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who have received no more than two prior lines of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaging cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease.  Subject randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_100643] (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PgR) positive versus ER and PgR negative, prior cytotoxic therapy versus no prior cytotoxic therapy and ECOG 0-1 versus 2.  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_1025973] 2011-002913-12
5
Methodology (Continued):
For subjects randomized to the veliparib + TMZ treatment arm, study visits will be conducted at Day 1, 
Day 15, and Day [ADDRESS_1025974] two cycles and then Day 1 of every cycle thereafter.  For subjects randomized to the veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment arms, study visits will be conducted at Day 1, Day 3, and Day [ADDRESS_1025975] will be conducted by [CONTACT_100672].  For patients who provide informed consent, archival tissue and optional paired tissue biopsies (C1D1 and Final Visit) will be obtained for correlative studies.
Subjects will continue dosing until they meet the defined discontinuation criteria.  When a subject meets 
the criteria for study discontinuation, a Final Visit will be conducted.  All subjects will have one Follow-up Visit approximately [ADDRESS_1025976] dose of veliparib + TMZ or veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel.
Survival information (i.e., the date and cause of death, and post treatment information) will be collected 
at monthly intervals (or as requested by [CONTACT_100678]), beginning on the date the subject is registered off study and for up to three (3) years until the endpoint of death, until the subject has become lost to follow-up or until study termination by [CONTACT_26282].  For subjects on study treatment more than [ADDRESS_1025977]-treatment follow-up.

Reference Therapy: Paclitaxel
Dose: 175 mg/m2 Day 3 of 21-day cycle 
Mode of Administration: Intravenously (IV)
Duration of Treatment:   Subjects with controlled disease (complete response [CR], partial response 
[PR], or stable disease [SD] per RECIST version 1.1 and with tolerable side effects may continue to 
receive treatment with veliparib + TMZ until reaching a protocol-defined event of disease progression, or experiencing unmanageable toxicity, or reaching a maximum of 24 cycles of veliparib + TMZ.  If TMZ has been discontinued, veliparib will also be discontinued.  If the subject has not progressed and the investigator feels there is benefit from continued treatment for longer than [ADDRESS_1025991] may continue to receive veliparib + TMZ until the subject has disease progression or experiences a toxicity that requires discontinuation of further treatment.  Subjects randomized to veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel with controlled disease and with tolerable side effects may continue to receive treatment until reaching a protocol-defined event of disease progression or experiencing unmanageable toxicity.  If both carboplatin and paclitaxel have been discontinued due to toxicity, veliparib will also be discontinued.
Interim Analyses:  To ensure subject safety, an IDMC will review unblinded safety data (which will 
include all subjects enrolled in the study) when approximately [ADDRESS_1025992] one of the following criteria: 
•Received two cycles of treatment
•Reached an event of disease progression
•Discontinued the study due to toxicity/adverse events 
Subsequent reviews will be based on recommendations from the IDMC.
In addition, an interim futility analysis will be conducted and reviewed after the Week [ADDRESS_1025993] one measurable lesion at baseline and randomized to the veliparib + TMZ treatment group (across both Group 1 and Group 2).  If futility is declared at the time of the futility analysis for the veliparib + TMZ treatment arm, any subjects receiving veliparib + TMZ will be allowed the option of either receiving veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel or discontinuing therapy and remain on study and continue to follow the scheduled for study visits and procedures.

Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:  Progression-free survival (PFS) using modified RECIST version 1.1 assessment at 9-week 
intervals.  In addition to being reviewed by [CONTACT_1755]/or site staff, radiographic scans will be 
sent to a central imaging center for review.  Events of disease progression will be determined by [CONTACT_63379].  Only subjects with deleterious mutations documented by [CONTACT_750022].  Post treatment information and survival information will be collected at monthly intervals (or as requested by [CONTACT_100678]) beginning on the date the subject is registered off study and for up to three (3) years until the endpoint of death, the subject is lost to follow-up or until the study termination by [CONTACT_26282].
The Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) and Objective Response Rate (ORR) using RECIST (version 1.1) will be assessed.
QoL assessment criteria via the EORTC QLQ-C15/BR23 Scale will be collected pre-dose on C1D1, 
Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every other cycle thereafter beginning with Cycle 4 (C6, C8, etc.), Final Visit, and at the Follow-up Visit.  In addition to the EORTC QLQ-C15/BR23 Scale, subjects randomized to the veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment arms will complete the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 Scale.
Safety:   The safety of each treatment group will be assessed by [CONTACT_100651], adverse 
events, serious adverse events, all deaths, changes in laboratory determinations, and vital sign parameters.  Subjects who did not receive study drug (veliparib or placebo) will not be included in the analyses of safety.
Statistical Methods:  Unless otherwise noted, for all statistical analyses, statistical significance will be 
determined by a two-sided Pvalue ≤0.05 when rounded.
Efficacy (Primary and Secondary Endpoints):  The analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints will include only the subjects who have been documented to have deleterious mutations by [CONTACT_100649].  Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to evaluate the impact of any discrepancies between results from the local laboratory and from the Sponsor core laboratory.
Progression-Free Survival:   PFS will be defined as the number of days from the date the subject is 
randomized to the date the subject experiences a confirmed event of disease progression (as confirmed by [CONTACT_750023]), or to the date of death (all causes of mortality) if disease progression is not reached.  Events of death will be included for subjects who had not experienced a confirmed event of disease progression provided the death occurred within [ADDRESS_1025995]'s data will be censored at the date of the subject's last available disease progression assessment.
Overall Survival:   Time to death for a given subject will be defined as the number of days from the day 
the subject is randomized to the date of the subject's death.  All events of death will be included, regardless of whether the event occurs while the subject is still taking study drug, or after the subject discontinues study drug.  If a subject has not died, then the data will be censored at the date when the subject is last known to be alive.
Clinical Benefit Rate:  Clinical benefit rate (CR, PR, SD or Non-CR/Non-PD) at Week 18 will be 
defined as the progression-free rate at 18 weeks from the Kaplan-Meier curve for time to progression 
(defined as from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression as determined by [CONTACT_750024]).  All intent to treat (ITT) subjects will be included in the analysis.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Objective Response Rate:   ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed complete or 
partial response per RECIST (version 1.1) as determined by [CONTACT_750025].  All subjects who 
have had at least one measurable lesion at baseline will be included in the ORR calculation.
Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy:  CIPN (as assessed by [CONTACT_750026]20 
questionnaire and NCI-CTCAE 4.0 grading for peripheral neuropathy).
Safety:   Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_100651], adverse events, serious adverse 
events, all deaths, as well as changes in laboratory determinations and vital sign parameters.  Subjects 
who are randomized but do not receive study drug (veliparib or placebo) will not be included in the analyses of safety.  Safety analysis results will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].

1  In the [LOCATION_002] (US) and Europe, breast cancer 
is the most common cancer in women, with over 180,000 new cases in the US and 332,000 new cases in the countries of the European Union (EU-27) in 2008.

[ADDRESS_1026015] a lifetime risk of 40% to 85% of developi[INVESTIGATOR_100621].[ADDRESS_1026016] cancer.  Malignancies with deficiencies in homologous repair, such as BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient tumors, are more susceptible to cytotoxicity induced by [CONTACT_100660]-damaging agents and are more dependent on PARP for DNA repair than normal cells.  This explains why BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1026017] tumor subgroups with unique expression profiles, including a HER2-positive subgroup, an estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subgroup, and a subgroup termed "basal-like" or "triple-negative."  A common feature of tumors in the basal-like 
subgroup is the lack of expression of ER, PgR, and HER2, resulting in the description "triple-negative breast cancer" (TNBC).  Although not all triple-negative breast cancers are basal-like, the classification of triple-negative tumors based on immunohistochemical staining is a clinically useful surrogate for the majority of basal-like breast cancer.  The majority of breast cancers with germline BRCA1 mutations are of the triple-negative phenotype, and chemotherapy is the only current treatment option for these patients.

Treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer often involves sequencing of successive lines of endocrine therapy with either aromatase inhibitors (AI) or the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen.  However, up to one-third of subjects are primarily resistant to endocrine therapy and most subjects who initially respond to endocrine therapy will eventually become resistant.  Therefore, the vast majority of HR+ advanced breast cancer subjects will receive chemotherapy during the course of their disease.
A minority of BRCA-deficient tumors also express HER2 receptors (approximately 
3%).

[ADDRESS_1026020] cancer is still considered incurable.
3.2 Carboplatin and Paclitaxel
Carboplatin is a commonly used platinum compound that acts by [CONTACT_100653] (DNA) cross-links and, thus, interrupting cell division.  It is approved by [CONTACT_100654] (FDA) for the treatment of ovarian cancer and by [CONTACT_3558] (EMA) for ovarian cancer of epi[INVESTIGATOR_100623].  It is also used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck cancer, endometrial cancer, metastatic seminoma, and more recently in breast cancer, with reported response rates of 20% to 50% in previously untreated patients with metastatic breast cancer.
15  Carboplatin is eliminated by [CONTACT_100655] (GFR).  Therefore, it is dosed on the basis of GFR and the target area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC).  Myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity of carboplatin and is dose-dependent.  Anemia may be cumulative and require transfusion support with prolonged therapy.  Anaphylactic-like reactions to carboplatin have been reported and may occur within minutes of carboplatin administration.  The risk of allergic reactions is increased in patients previously exposed to platinum therapy.  Other toxicities include nausea, vomiting, renal toxicity, and neurotoxicity.
Paclitaxel promotes the assembly of microtubule formation and stabilizes them by 
[CONTACT_100656].  It is insoluble in water and, therefore, is formulated in cremophor.  Paclitaxel is approved by [CONTACT_750027].  It is also approved by [CONTACT_750028], NSCLC, and Kaposi's sarcoma.  It is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion and can be used either on a 3-weekly schedule or a weekly

2antagonists.
Emerging data suggest that BRCA1/2-mutated tumors may be more sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, including carboplatin.  Specifically, two studies by [CONTACT_750029], et al, are relevant to the use of platinum agents for BRCA-associated breast cancer.  The first was a small prospective trial of single-agent neoadjuvant cisplatin in patients with BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast cancer and demonstrated a high pathologic 
complete response rate (9 of 10 patients; 90%).
16  The data were recently updated to 
include 25 patients in the expanded cohort, and it was found that the pathological complete response had fallen to 72%.
[ADDRESS_1026022] cancer who were treated with non-platinum regimens.  The pathological complete response rate across all regimens was 24% in the [ADDRESS_1026023] cancer; in contrast, the pathological complete response in the cisplatin-treated cohort was 83% (10 of 12 patients; 95% CI = 54% – 96%) and was far 
lower in the other aggregated regimens (14 of 90 patients; 16%, CI = 9% – 25%).

TMZ is a prodrug of the active alkylating agent 5 (3 methyltrizen-1-yl) imidazole4-carbozimide (MTIC).  Adverse events associated with TMZ observed in previously conducted studies in glioblastoma, include myelosuppression with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (reported as adverse event or laboratory abnormality) in 8% of subjects and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (reported as adverse event or laboratory abnormality) in 14% of subjects.

Poly(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase (PARP) Mechanism of Action
Poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) is a nuclear enzyme that recognizes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and facilitates DNA repair.
23,24  Inactive 
PARPs 1 and 2 bind to damaged DNA, which leads to their auto-activation.  The resulting activated PARP then poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates many nuclear target proteins, including those that facilitate DNA repair of both single-stranded or double-stranded DNA breaks.  Thus, PARP inhibition will result in less efficient DNA repair following a DNA damage insult.
DNA-damaging agents, including cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy, remain a 
mainstay of treatment for many subjects with cancer.  Since cancer cells are genetically unstable, often exhibiting complex karyotypes that include large deletions, insertions, and unbalanced translocations of chromosomal fragment, these cells are more susceptible than normal tissues to cytotoxicity induced by [CONTACT_100660]-damaging agents.
[ADDRESS_1026027] been shown in preclinical models to sensitize tumors to ionizing radiation therapy and a variety of DNA-damaging agents, including alkylators, such as TMZ, and cross-linking agents, such as carboplatin.
3.4 Veliparib
A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacology can be 
found in the Investigator's Brochure.

3.4.1 Preclinical Experience
Veliparib is a novel small molecule that is a potent inhibitor of both PARP-1 and PARP-2 with K
is of 5 nM and 3 nM, respectively.  In cells under oxidative stress, 
veliparib inhibits the PARP induced formation of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) with an EC [ADDRESS_1026028] efficacious alkylating agents in combination with PARP inhibition is TMZ.  Preclinical studies delivering veliparib by [CONTACT_750030] 70 ng/mL.  No significant increase in body weight loss was observed with these combinations relative to TMZ monotherapy.  Human

pharmacokinetics indicate that an oral dose of 40 mg BID, the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) in combination with TMZ, produces an average steady-state AUC 0-24of 
4.41μg•hr/mL, exposures greater than those achieved with the preclinical maximally 
efficacious dose (AUC 0-24of 3.0μg•hr/mL).
The combination of veliparib + TMZ has demonstrated significant efficacy in a variety of preclinical tumor models, including settings where TMZ alone is ineffective and in both BRCA1- or BRCA2-competent and BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutated backgrounds.  In the 
BRCA-deficient MX-[ADDRESS_1026030] dose of 50 mg/kg/day for 5 days exhibits minimal inhibition of tumor growth (35% TGI, Figure 1 a) with no evidence of complete pathological tumor regression.  In contrast, 
addition of veliparib at 25 mg/kg/day to the therapy regimen results in profound antitumor activity (97% TGI), including 50% complete tumor regressions.  In Capan-1, a human BRCA2-deficient pancreatic cancer cell line (6174delT in Exon 11 resulting in a truncated BRCA2), the combination of veliparib with TMZ resulted in significantly more tumor regressions than either agent alone ( Figure 1 b).

Veliparib and Neuropathy
Analogues of veliparib attenuated development of mechanical allodynia in vincristine, 
cisplatin and oxaliplatin preclinical models of chemotherapy-induced pain.  Neuropathy was induced in rats by [CONTACT_750031].  To investigate the ability of PARP inhibitors to attenuate vincristine-induced pain, rats were administered a PARP inhibitor, A-861696 or A-902274, at doses of 25 mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day (IP), for 2 days prior to the initiation of vincristine administration.  After 2 days of pre-dosing with the PARP inhibitor, two minipumps were implanted in rats for vincristine and compound administration.  Vincristine was administered via a subcutaneous mini-osmotic pump that delivered 30 μg/kg/day (IV) for 12 days.  PARP inhibitor, A-861696 or A-902274, or 
vehicle was administered via a subcutaneous mini osmotic pump that delivered 25 mg/kg/day, 50 mg/kg/day, or vehicle (IP) for 12 days.  A positive control group of rats receiving vincristine were dosed acutely with morphine (6 mg/kg, IP) on testing days.

In mice, neuropathy was induced by [CONTACT_750032].  Mice were administered a PARP Inhibitor, A-861696, at doses of 25 mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day (IP) for 2 days prior to the initiation of cisplatin.  The 50 mg/kg dose of A-861696 was administered (IP) for 2 days prior to oxaliplatin administration.  After 2 days of pre-dosing with the PARP Inhibitor, mice were co-administered A-861696 with cisplatin 
or oxaliplatin for 5 days (daily injections, IP), followed by 5 days off, and then followed by 5 daily injections (IP).  Cumulative dose of cisplatin was 23 mg/kg.  Cumulative dose of oxaliplatin was 30 mg/kg.  Behavioral assays were performed on all groups of mice using von Frey monofilaments before dosing, and then at Weeks 3, 6, and 8.  Behavioral assays included determining mechanical threshold with von Frey monofilaments, latency to paw withdrawal from a radiant heat source, and number of paw lifts from a cold plate.  A-861696 attenuated development of mechanical allodynia in the cisplatin model at Weeks 3, 6, and 8, and in the oxaliplatin model at Week 3 and Week 6 ( Figure 4 ).  In 
addition, A-[ADDRESS_1026033] therapeutic potential of PARP inhibitors for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
Preliminary clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data available from [ADDRESS_1026035] on veliparib bioavailability.  The mean total urinary recovery of veliparib (as parent compound and M8 metabolite) is 86%, which indicates that renal excretion is an important pathway in veliparib elimination.
Potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) of veliparib are being evaluated in veliparib 
combination studies.  Veliparib is not a potent inhibitor, nor an inducer, of the major

34
human cytochrome P450s (CYPs), suggesting a minimal potential for DDIs at the 
anticipated therapeutic concentrations.  Preliminary results indicate the absence of a DDI between veliparib and TMZ.
In Phase 0 Study A10-161, substantial inhibition of PARP activity was observed in tumor 
biopsies collected 3 to 6 hours after dosing in all 3 subjects who received a single dose of 25 mg veliparib (92%, 95%, and 100%).  Complete inhibition of PARP activity in PBMCs, maintained through 24 hours after dosing, was achieved in 3 of the subjects who received 50 mg veliparib.  For the 50 mg dose group, PARP activity inhibition in tumor biopsies averaged 75% 3 to 6 hours after dosing (N = 3) and averaged 74% 24 hours after dosing (N = 3).  Therefore, both 25 mg and 50 mg veliparib were found to be biologically active.
[IP_ADDRESS] Toxicology
The toxicological profile of veliparib has been characterized in general toxicology studies 
of up to 6 months' duration in rats and 9 months' duration in dogs, in genotoxic studies (Ames assay, in vitro cytogenetics assay, in vivo micronucleus study), and in embryofetal development studies.  The primary target organs of veliparib exposure are the central nervous system (convulsions and other CNS-related signs), the hematologic system (decreased red and white blood cells), the bone marrow (hypocellularity), the lymphoid tissues (lymphocyte depletion), and the male (germ cell depletion) and the female (corpora  lutea decrease and minimal degeneration of granulosa cells in follicles) reproductive tissues, with lesser effects on the cardiovascular system (10% QTc prolongation) and the gastrointestinal tract (single cell necrosis).  Convulsions and other CNS-related signs were considered exposure-dependent and were generally self-limiting, ameliorated by [CONTACT_100661], or respondent to treatment.  All other findings were dose-dependent and reversible upon discontinuation of veliparib administration.  Veliparib was genotoxic (induced chromosomal aberrations in vitro and increased micronuclei formation in vivo) and was toxic to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103] (increased incidence of fetal, visceral, skeletal malformations and/or variations).  Veliparib also

absorbs ultraviolet light and is distributed to both the skin and the eyes following systemic 
exposure, which poses a potential phototoxicity risk.
3.4.2 Clinical Experience
A Phase 0 dose-ranging pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study has been 
completed (NCI IND).  Thirteen subjects with various types of advanced cancer received a single dose of single-agent veliparib (10 mg, n = 3; 25 mg, n = 3; 50 mg, n = 7).  The pharmacokinetic results from this study demonstrated that veliparib is orally bioavailable and primarily cleared through renal excretion, with a half-life of 4 to 5 hours.  Additionally, this study provided proof of mechanism, as tumor PARP inhibition (> 90%) was demonstrated in 5 out of 6 human tumor biopsies that were obtained 3 to 6 hours after dosing with either 25 mg or 50 mg veliparib.  No serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), or deaths were reported for this study.
[ADDRESS_1026038] a unique set of toxicities that is predominately similar to that anticipated for the backbone regimen, and also, a unique recommended Phase 2 dose.  Due to this, multiple Phase 1 studies of veliparib in combination with various chemotherapeutic agents are being conducted.  
Study M06-862 is a dose-escalating Phase 1 study of veliparib BID on Days 1 through 7 
in combination with TMZ QD on Days 1 through 5 (28-day cycle) in subjects with nonhematologic malignancies.  No DLTs were reported for the first 3 dose cohorts (veliparib 10, 20, and 40 mg BID).  In cohorts receiving 60 mg and 80 mg, events of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported.  The MTD combination dose was defined as veliparib 40 mg BID and TMZ 200 mg/m
2QD.  Although no DLTs were 
reported in subjects in the 40 mg veliparib BID/200 mg/m2TMZ QD dose-escalation 
cohort, 8 of all 12 subjects receiving 40 mg veliparib BID/200 mg/m2in an expanded 
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026039] 2011-002913-12
36
safety cohort experienced Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia.  In general, 
subjects with these events recovered after dose reduction and remained on study.  In order to minimize these hematologic toxicities, the protocol was modified to treat new subjects with 40 mg veliparib BID in combination with 150 mg/m
2TMZ QD in the first cycle.  If a 
subject did not experience Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities or other clinically significant NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) toxicities greater than Grade 3, the TMZ dose was escalated to 200 mg/m
2QD.  The study also 
included 20 mg and 30 mg BID expanded safety cohorts who were dosed following the amended protocol.  Overall, as the dosage of veliparib increased from 20 to 40 mg BID, there appeared to be a trend of increase in frequency of Grade 3 and 4 hematological toxicities.
Study M10-440 is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
veliparib (20 or 40 mg BID) in combination with TMZ (150 mg/m
2/day with possible 
escalation to 200 mg/m2).  This study is fully enrolled and ongoing (n = 346).  The most 
common adverse events (reported in ≥ 30% of subjects receiving veliparib + TMZ) were 
nausea, fatigue, constipation, thrombocytopenia, and vomiting.
In a Phase 2, investigator-initiated study,22to date, [ADDRESS_1026040] received veliparib 40 mg BID Days 1 through 7 plus TMZ 150 to 200 mg/m2
Days [ADDRESS_1026041], the 8 subjects with a known deleterious BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1026042] demonstrated 1 confirmed CR, 4 PR (3 confirmed), and 3 subjects with progressive disease (ORR) = 50% and CBR = 62.5%).  Of the subjects with deleterious mutations of BRCA1/2, there were 3 BRCA1 carriers (1 PR, 2 PD) and 5 BRCA2 carriers (1 CR, 3 PR, and 1 PD).  Progression has occurred as the best response in 34 of the 41 subjects, many within 1 to 2 cycles.  Adverse events in this study include Grade 3/[ADDRESS_1026043] 2011-002913-12

30 mg BID (in combination with 200 mg/m2of TMZ).  All of the subjects who responded 
to veliparib with TMZ received 40 mg BID veliparib initially, then 30 mg BID following the dose-reduction amendment.
This study was amended to include an expanded cohort of 20 BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1026044] received veliparib 30 mg BID with TMZ 150 to 200 mg/m
2Days [ADDRESS_1026045] been similar to those observed in the initial cohort; however, the response rate has diminished.  In addition to the reduced dose of veliparib, the expansion cohort differed from the initial subjects in that approximately half of the patients had received prior platinum therapy.  This is notable, as previous studies suggest that similar mechanisms of resistance can lead to decreased activity of both platinums and PARP inhibitors, such as reversion of BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1026046] been manageable with veliparib 40 mg BID and the potential decrease in efficacy at the 30 mg dose, veliparib will be used at 40 mg BID in combination with TMZ (150 to 200 mg/m
2) in this study.
The combination of veliparib with carboplatin and paclitaxel has been investigated in ongoing Phase 1 studies conducted in collaboration with the NCI CTEP.  CTEP 7967 study is a Phase 1 dose escalation study evaluating the addition of veliparib to carboplatin + paclitaxel in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.  CTEP 7967 enrolled subjects who are chemotherapy-naive as well as subjects who received previous DNA damaging chemotherapy including platinum compounds.  In this study, the maximum dose administered is veliparib 120 mg BID for 7 days in addition to carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m
2administered on Day 3 of a 21-day cycle.  At this dose, two out 
of six subjects developed protocol defined dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).  The first DLT was grade [ADDRESS_1026047] anti-emetic therapy; this event resolved with additional treatment.  The second DLT was febrile grade [ADDRESS_1026048] who previously received multiple cycles of dacarbazine (an 
alkylating agent which may cause cumulative bone marrow damage).  The event of febrile neutropenia resolved after G-CSF therapy and anti-bacterial therapy, and the subject continued veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel therapy.  Both of these DLTs were reversible and manageable and did not lead to study treatment discontinuation due to toxicity.  Both febrile neutropenia and nausea are known toxicities of carboplatin + paclitaxel therapy and are known to resolve after standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3066] G-CSF, antibiotic therapy, anti-emetics, and well-defined dose reductions.  Preliminary data from 
CTEP [ADDRESS_1026049] cancer had confirmed responses (3 CR, 5 PR).
[ADDRESS_1026050] cancer receiving veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel on either a q 3 week regimen (CTEP 7967) or a weekly regimen (carboplatin AUC 2, paclitaxel 80 mg/m

the weekly regimen (2 CR, 3 PR, n = 10) and an objective response rate of 55% was observed with the q 3 week regimen (2 CR, 4 PR).

GOG 9923 is an ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation study that is also evaluating veliparib in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab (initiated in cycle 2) in subjects with advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer (chemotherapy-naïve).  The intermittent regimen with veliparib in combination with q-[ADDRESS_1026051] cancer, the addition of a PARP inhibitor (veliparib) to TMZ resulted in responses in patients with deleterious germline mutations in BRCA1/2, with a 50% ORR.  A single-arm trial evaluated a PARP inhibitor in metastatic breast cancer subjects with BRCA1/2 mutations and demonstrated single-agent activity, with an ORR of 38% in heavily pretreated subjects.
39  A similar trial in BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1026052] 2011-002913-12
39
carriers with metastatic ovarian cancer showed a response rate of 33%.40  Notably, both 
single-agent studies demonstrated increased response rates with higher doses of PARP 
inhibitor (olaparib 100 mg BID and 400 mg BID), where both doses are considered biologically active.  Together, these results validate the proof of concept that PARP inhibition is an attractive therapeutic target in breast and other cancers.
A therapeutic potential for veliparib has also been suggested in BRCA1/2-mutated breast 
cancer, and specifically for the utility of the veliparib + TMZ combination.  The combination of veliparib and TMZ resulted in dramatic tumor growth delay or regression in many preclinical models, including BRCA-deficient tumor models, where TMZ by [CONTACT_750033] (Section 3.4.1).

41and prevention of resistance to TMZ, which is 
thought to be responsible for the low efficacy of TMZ in many tumor types.42,[ADDRESS_1026053] cancer, a 50% CBR (14/28; 1 CR, 6 PR, 7 SD) has occurred to date in patients with deleterious BRCA mutations (including both the original and the expansion cohort).  This is in contrast to historical clinical data that suggest that TMZ monotherapy has low activity in breast cancer.  Most notably, two Phase 2 studies with a dose-dense TMZ regimen demonstrated no responses (0/18) in patients with metastatic breast cancer and 2 responses (2/51) in patients with brain metastases from histologically confirmed breast cancer.
43,44  While the Phase 2a study 
indicates that veliparib in combination with TMZ is an active regimen, this study was initially designed as a single-arm study in an unselected patient population; thus, further evaluation is needed to determine the activity of this regimen relative to efficacious regimens in metastatic breast cancer.
Therapeutic potential in breast cancer has also been observed with veliparib in 
combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel.  [COMPANY_013] is conducting a Phase 1, dose-escalation trial of veliparib with carboplatin + paclitaxel (CTEP 7967) in collaboration with Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP).  In this study, the 
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026054] 2011-002913-12
40
combination of veliparib with carboplatin + paclitaxel was well tolerated with a similar 
incidence of most toxicities, including hematological toxicities to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) carboplatin + paclitaxel study.
45  In the preliminary efficacy 
analysis, 1 out of 4 chemotherapy-naïve metastatic NSCLC patients had a confirmed response to veliparib with carboplatin + paclitaxel chemotherapy (22% ORR in ECOG trial), and [ADDRESS_1026055] cancer had confirmed responses (2 CR, 2 PR), with an additional 2 patients with unconfirmed responses (1 PR, 1 CR).  In the CTEP 7967 study, the maximum tolerated dose for veliparib was 120 mg BID with 2 out of 6 patients experiencing DLTs (febrile neutropenia, vomiting).  The study also includes a separate, ongoing, dose escalation in patients with BRCA-mutated tumors with veliparib in combination with carboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m
2).  
In addition to CTEP 7967, veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel has been evaluated in GOG 9923.  As of [ADDRESS_1026056] been treated with veliparib 150 mg BID on Days 1 to 21 with carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m
2
on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.  No grade 3/4 toxicity or DLTs occurred at the 150 mg BID dose level during DLT evaluation period; thus, in the GOG [ADDRESS_1026057] similar to Study M12-895 
(ovarian cancer patients, many of whom will have BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1026058] tumors with a BRCAness phenotype) and the similarity in paclitaxel dosing between the two studies, in addition to the data indicating increased response rates with higher doses of the PARP inhibitor, the veliparib [ADDRESS_1026059]-line chemotherapy is associated with potential benefit in PFS and OS; thus, therapy in this study will be continued until PD or toxicity results in treatment discontinuation.
[ADDRESS_1026060] cancer with a deleterious germline mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 through the addition of veliparib to therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel or to temozolomide.  Preclinical data demonstrate that veliparib potentiates the anti-tumor activity of platinums and temozolomide, and data from early-phase clinical studies (completed or preliminary) are consistent with these observations.
Veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel has been investigated in 
three Phase 1 studies, an adaptive Phase 2 study, and two randomized blinded Phase 2 studies.  Of these studies, preliminary efficacy data is available from the Phase 1 study conducted in advanced solid tumors (Study CTEP 7967) with durable responses observed in breast cancer (5 PR, 3 CR, n = 14), non-small cell lung cancer (4 PR, 1 CR with an additional PR in a patient with SCLC, n = 16), and other advanced solid tumors (gastric, head and neck, melanoma, urothelial).  The most common serious adverse event in studies with veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel has been neutropenia (4.5% of subjects) and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (> 30% of subjects) have been neutropenia, leucopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, nausea, anemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy.  These events have been similar in severity and nature to that anticipated for the backbone regimen of carboplatin/paclitaxel alone.
Veliparib in combination with TMZ has been evaluated in 7 [COMPANY_013]-sponsored clinical 
studies in subjects with various solid tumors.  Based on preliminary data from the seven studies with veliparib and temozolomide (N = 527), the most common serious adverse event was thrombocytopenia (17 subjects, 3.2%).  The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, reported in > 30% of all subjects, were nausea (384 subjects, 72.9%), fatigue (348 subjects, 66.0%), constipation (248 subjects, 47.1%), thrombocytopenia (233 subjects, 44.2%), and vomiting (201 subjects, 38.1%).  The preliminary safety results from a randomized Phase 2 placebo-controlled study comparing temozolomide plus veliparib (20 or 40 mg twice daily on Days 1 – 7) every [ADDRESS_1026061] 2011-002913-12
42
toxicity profile of veliparib with temozolomide is similar to that of temozolomide alone, 
with some increase in the frequency of hematological toxicities (Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia 23.8% versus 15.0%, respectively, and neutropenia 16.0% versus 5.3%).  These toxicities are commonly associated with cancer therapy, and standard clinical practices to manage these toxicities are well-established. 
Other potential risks of veliparib administration, identified in preclinical studies or based 
on pharmacological mechanism, but not confirmed in clinical studies must also be considered.  These risks include seizures, changes in testes/ovaries, toxicity to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_26168].
In summary, veliparib is an orally available PARP inhibitor that has been shown to 
significantly potentiate the effects of carboplatin/paclitaxel and temozolomide in multiple preclinical models of tumor progression.  Anti-tumor activities also were observed in early clinical studies.  Potential risks, as identified above, will be minimized by [CONTACT_100664].  The potential clinical benefit and the mitigation of potential risks to metastatic breast cancer patients support the further evaluation of veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel or with temozolomide in the Phase [ADDRESS_1026062] 2011-002913-12
43
The secondary objectives of the study are to assess OS, CBR through the end of Week 18, 
and ORR, in those subjects treated with veliparib in combination with TMZ or treated with veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel versus placebo in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.  In addition, CIPN (as assessed by [CONTACT_750026]20 questionnaire and NCI-CTCAE 4.0 grading for peripheral neuropathy) will be assessed in those subjects treated with veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel versus placebo in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
The tertiary objectives are to assess ECOG performance status, QoL, and exploratory 
correlative endpoints.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_1026063] cancer (not amenable to therapy with curative intent) or metastatic breast cancer who have received no more than two prior lines of cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease.  Approximately 120 research sites will participate.
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_1026064] randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_89482]-positive and/or PgR-positive 
versus ER-negative and PgR-negative status, prior cytotoxic therapy versus no prior cytotoxic therapy, and ECOG 0-1 versus 2.
Under the original protocol, approximately 4 subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio 
(Group 1) to one of the three treatment arms ([ADDRESS_1026065] in veliparib 40 mg BID + TMZ arm and a total of 3 subjects in either the veliparib 80 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel or the placebo BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel arms) at approximately [ADDRESS_1026066] 2011-002913-12
44
Subjects randomized under the original protocol will be considered Group 1 and will not 
be considered towards the primary efficacy analyses.
Following approval of Amendment 1, the veliparib dose in combination with carboplatin 
and paclitaxel was increased to 120 mg BID.  Approximately 290 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio (Group 2) to one of the three treatment arms (veliparib 40 mg BID + TMZ, veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel, placebo BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel) at approximately 120 research sites.  Subjects randomized following approval of Amendment 1 will be considered Group 2 and will be considered towards the primary efficacy analyses.
Veliparib + Temozolomide Dosing Arm
Subjects randomized to receive veliparib 40 mg BID + TMZ will self-administer the 
morning dose of veliparib and TMZ at the same time and the evening dose of veliparib approximately 12 hours after the morning dose in the same calendar day on Days 1 to 7 of each 28-day cycle as per Table 1.
For Cycle 1, the TMZ dose will start at 150 mg/m
2QD on Days 1 to 5 of each 28-day 
cycle as per Table 1 .  The TMZ dose will be determined by [CONTACT_51737] (BSA) 
calculated from the height obtained at the baseline evaluation and the weight obtained prior to each cycle.  The daily dose will be rounded to the nearest [ADDRESS_1026067] convenience, the dose may be rounded down to 5% from calculated dose in order to minimize the number of capsules per dose.  The exact dose administered will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
If during the first cycle, platelets (nadir) are > 100,000/ μL and the ANC (nadir) is 
> 1,500/μ L and no Grade 3 or 4 CTCAE nonhematologic toxicities attributable to TMZ 
are observed, then the TMZ dose will be escalated to 200 mg/m
2QD (per BSA) for 
Cycle 2 ( Table 2 ).  If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, then the dose should not be 
escalated in future cycles.  For all cycles, dose delays and reductions will be managed 
according to Section 5.7.

Upon approval of protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1026069] 2011-002913-12
46
veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment arms will receive 120 mg BID of 
veliparib/placebo.  Subjects randomized to the 80 mg BID veliparib/placebo starting dose will continue to receive veliparib/placebo as specified per the original protocol for the duration of their study treatment.   
Subjects randomized to receive veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel will 
self-administer veliparib or placebo on Days 1 to 7 of each 21-day cycle as per Table 3.  
The evening dose of veliparib/placebo should be administered approximately 12 hours after the morning dose.  Carboplatin and paclitaxel will be administered on Day 3 of each 21-day cycle.  Paclitaxel will be infused before carboplatin.  The dose of carboplatin and paclitaxel will be based upon the baseline weight (C1D1) for all cycles; however, the dose should be recalculated on the basis of new weight, if there is a weight change of > 10% from baseline; adjustments for weight change < 10% are allowed per institutional guidelines.  The morning dosing of veliparib/placebo on Day 3 of every cycle should be taken before the carboplatin + paclitaxel infusion per Table [ADDRESS_1026070] characteristics (SmPC).
47  The 
medications used for the pretreatment of paclitaxel will be recorded in the eCRF.
Paclitaxel will be administered intravenously over approximately 3 hours at a dose of 
175 mg/m2.
Carboplatin
Carboplatin48will be administered intravenously over approximately 15 to 30 minutes at 
AUC 6, immediately following paclitaxel infusion.  The duration of carboplatin infusion may be lengthened according to institutional guidelines.  When glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is estimated by [CONTACT_750034] (IDMS) method, the maximum dose of carboplatin should be limited to [ADDRESS_1026071] 2011-002913-12
47
Similarly, when the GFR is estimated using Isotopic/edetic acid (EDTA) clearance, 
maximum carboplatin dosing should be based upon standard guidelines and institutional practices.

biologic therapy), radiotherapy, and investigational agents.  An investigational agent is 
any drug or therapy not currently approved for use in humans.
Anticancer Agents: Subject must have received no more than two prior lines of 
cytotoxic therapy for metastatic breast cancer.  
Regimens received in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting or for 
locally recurrent disease within the past 6 months will also be considered towards the maximum of two prior lines of therapy.
Prior therapy with biologic agents including vaccines and 
immunostimulants are allowed.
Prior therapy with signal transduction agents such as 
EGFR/HER2-direct agents (e.g., trastuzumab, lapatinib,

Premedication: The prophylactic use of a 5-HT3-antagonist is strongly 
recommended before TMZ administration.  Additional 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), or institution standard of care/approved prophylactic antiemetics may be given, as appropriate.
To reduce the severity of hypersensitivity reactions due to 
treatment with paclitaxel, please manage according to 
institutional guidelines, the locally approved product label, 
local practice, or applicable SmPC (i.e., premedication with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H
2antagonists).
Anticancer Agents: Anticancer agents are not permitted during the treatment portion of the study.  All subjects will receive carboplatin + paclitaxel with veliparib/placebo or temozolomide with 
veliparib during the treatment portion of the study.  The locally approved carboplatin, paclitaxel, and temozolomide product labels or SmPCs should be referenced to determine if there are 
any contraindications associated with concomitant medications 
(e.g., yellow fever vaccine, phenytoin, etc.).

Supportive Care: Best supportive care and treatment will be given as appropriate 
to each subject (antiemetics, antibiotics, transfusions, 
nutritional support, non-radiation palliative treatment for pain, 
bisphosphonates or denosumab) according to institutional guidelines or American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines.  
ASCO guidelines recommend a two drug combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone for moderately emetic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as carboplatin.  If palonosetron is not 
available, any of the first generation 5 HT3 receptor antagonists may be used, preferably ondansetron or granisetron.  ASCO dosing guidelines are as follows:
•Palonosetron 0.25 g IV OR 0.50 mg oral, Day 1 only
•Dexamethasone 8 mg (IV or oral), Days 1 to 3
Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_100625], though clinicians may consider its use.  If clinicians opt to use aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], dosing guidelines are as follows:

•5-HT
3receptor antagonist dosing
•Dexamethasone:  12 mg on Day 1 only.49
Prophylactic antimicrobials should be considered in subjects receiving concurrent immunosuppressive (i.e., corticosteroids) therapy and those with lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count < 800) and continued until lymphopenia resolves.
Growth Factors: Biologic response modifiers administered for erythropoiesis 
(e.g., erythropoietin, darbepoetin alpha) and colony-stimulating 
factors (e.g., neulasta, G-CSF, GM CSF, etc.) may be 
administered to maintain dose intensity or to avoid dose delays according to standard institutional practice or clinical practice guidelines (e.g., ASCO, ESMO).
Radiation: Radiation therapy is not allowed during the study.  If radiation 
therapy is needed to treat the symptoms due to underlying

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
The study procedures outlined in Table 4 and Table 5 are discussed in detail in this 
section, with the exception of the monitoring of treatment compliance (Section 5.5.6) and 
the collection of concomitant medication (Section 5.2.3) and adverse event information 
(Section 6.0).  All study data will be recorded within the EDC system.
Screening procedures will occur within 28 days prior to C1D1 (excluding BRCA testing 
which may occur greater than 28 days prior to C1D1).  For procedures performed at Screening and repeated, the later procedure performed prior to dosing will serve as a baseline for clinical assessment.  Subsequent study procedures (excluding labs) should be performed within four (4) days surrounding the scheduled study visit date.  For Day 1 of each cycle after Cycle 2, lab samples may be collected up to 48 hours prior to dosing veliparib/TMZ.  For Day 1 of each cycle after Cycle 1, lab samples may be collected up to 48 hours prior to dosing veliparib/placebo. For subjects on study treatment more than 5 years, laboratory samples may be collected up to 4 days prior to dosing carboplatin/paclitaxel on Day 3.
Informed Consent
Signed informed consent will be obtained from the subject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative in order to participate in this study.  The IRB/IEC-approved informed consent must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_100670].  A separate informed consent will be required for the optional pharmacogenetic testing, needle/excisional/punch biopsy, and archival tissuecollection.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Subjects will be considered screen failures if the informed consent has been signed and after a study-specific procedure has been done (e.g., central laboratories drawn), but the 
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026124] does not meet eligibility criteria.  The reason for screen failure will be documented 
in the source document and will be captured in the eCRF.
Medical History
The following information will be collected during the Screening Visit:
●Complete medical history, including documentation of any clinically 
significant medical condition;
●History of tobacco and alcohol use;
●Presence and severity of any symptoms/conditions associated with metastatic breast cancer; and 
●Detailed oncology history, including:
○Date of primary cancer diagnosis;
○Pathology (histology or cytology) of primary tumor;
○Surgical history;
○Anticancer and radiation treatments administered (including dates and type 
of modality);
○Metastasis information (including the location and histological markers), if 
applicable.
On C1D1 any changes from the screening assessments, observed prior to dosing, will be 
recorded in the subject's medical history.  At each subsequent visit, the subject's medical history will be reviewed and any clinically significant changes from baseline will be recorded in the source documents and on the adverse event eCRF.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination (PE), including height, will be performed at Screening.  
A symptom-directed PE, including weight, will be performed at all other visits, unless indicated otherwise.  Height will be measured at Screening only.  For height and weight assessments, the subject should not wear shoes.  If the Screening PE is performed within [ADDRESS_1026125] 2011-002913-12
70
significant changes from baseline will be documented in the source documentation and 
eCRF as adverse events.
12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
For subjects randomized to the veliparib + TMZ treatment arm, a resting 12-lead ECG 
will be performed at the Screening Visit within 28 days of C1D1 (prior to the first dose of veliparib/TMZ to document the baseline status of the subject).  C1D1 (at approximately 2 hours after the morning dose of study drug), and Final Visit (if not performed within the last 4 weeks).  For subjects randomized to the veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment arms, a resting 12-lead ECG will be performed at the Screening Visit within 28 days of C1D1 (prior to the first dose of veliparib/placebo to document the baseline status of the subject), C1D3 (at approximately 2 hours after the morning dose of veliparib/placebo), and at the Final Visit (if not performed within the last 4 weeks).  A qualified physician will sign and date the ECGs, determine whether any findings outside normal physiological variation are clinically significant (in consultation with a cardiologist if necessary), and document this on the ECG report.  The original ECG tracing or copy with physician's assessment will be retained in the subject's records at the study site.  Final Visit ECG will not be required for subjects on study treatment more than [ADDRESS_1026126] be documented as being surgically sterile or postmenopausal (for at least 1 year).
The C1D1 urine pregnancy test results must be reviewed and determined to be negative 
prior to dosing.  If the urine pregnancy test is positive at C1D1, it should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test and dosing should be delayed.  The test may be repeated at the discretion of the investigator at any time during the study.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
All subjects will undergo the laboratory assessments outlined in Table 9.
All laboratory samples will be assessed using a certified central laboratory and these data 
will be used for all data analysis.  The central laboratory will provide instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_26172].  All laboratory samples will be shipped to the central laboratory.
A certified local reference laboratory may perform complete blood count (CBC) and 
chemistry tests prior to dosing in each cycle to allow for immediate subject management; however, split or concurrent samples will be drawn and sent to the central laboratory for analysis.  The appropriate certifications will be collected from both the central and local laboratories, as needed.
For subjects remaining on study treatment for more than [ADDRESS_1026127] prior to dosing carboplatin/paclitaxel. Local laboratory results should be documented in the source and the electronic data capture (EDC) system as appropriate. Samples will no longer be sent to the central laboratory for analysis.
Samples for chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be collected at all visits, unless 
otherwise indicated, as detailed below.  For screening labs performed greater than 7 days prior to C1D1, hematology/chemistry should be split at C1D1 and local labs reviewed

prior to dosing.  For subjects randomized to veliparib + TMZ, for Day 1 of each cycle 
after Cycle 2, lab samples may be collected up to 48 hours prior to dosing veliparib/TMZ.  For subjects randomized to veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel, for Day 1 of each cycle after Cycle 1, lab samples may be collected up to 48 hours prior to dosing veliparib/placebo.  For subjects on study treatment more than 5 years, lab samples may be collected up to 4 days prior to dosing carboplatin/paclitaxel.
●Urinalysis samples will be collected at Screening and on Day 1 of each 
subsequent cycle.  Urinalysis will no longer be required for subjects on study 
treatment more than 5 years.
●APTT/INR will be collected at Screening.
●BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation will be collected at Screening (unless BRCA germline mutation status is known per previous Sponsor core laboratory testing).
●For subjects randomized to the veliparib + TMZ treatment arm, chemistry samples will not be collected on C1D22 and C2D22.
In addition:
●For subjects randomized to the veliparib + TMZ treatment arm, only

BRCA1/BRCA2 Testing
BRCA1 and BRCA2 Germline Mutation Testing
The diagnosis of a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation must be documented prior to 
randomization and genetic risk assessment and counseling should proceed per NCCN guidelines or the standard policy of the institution.  A copy of the results (including non-Sponsor testing) will be needed for the site study file.  Subjects with BRCA variants of unknown significance will not be eligible for the study.
Documentation of BRCA mutation status must occur by [CONTACT_100673]:
●Previous diagnosis of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.  
If the diagnostic testing for BRCA1/BRCA2 was not conducted by [CONTACT_750038], the investigator should ensure that the testing is consistent with local guidelines and clinical practice and that the test employs either 1) direct DNA sequencing/MLPA or 2) a well-characterized methodology previously validated by [CONTACT_36086], such as that used to assess founder mutations.  These subjects must also undergo Sponsor core laboratory BRCA gene sequencing during Screening or on C1D1. 
Note:  These subjects may be eligible for randomization prior to receiving 
results from the Sponsor core laboratory. 
●Subjects who are considered high risk for carrying a BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation 
are eligible for Sponsor core BRCA testing if they meet one of the following criteria (per the most current NCCN guidelines):
50
○Breast cancer diagnosed at age ≤ 45 years;
○Breast cancer diagnosed at age ≤ 50 years with ≥ [ADDRESS_1026132] cancer diagnosis ≤ 50 years and/or 
≥[ADDRESS_1026133]-degree blood relative with epi[INVESTIGATOR_12248]/fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_750011];

○Diagnosed at age ≤ [ADDRESS_1026135] cancer;
○Diagnosed at age ≤ 50 years with a limited family history;
○Two breast primaries (i.e., bilateral disease or two or more clearly separate 
ipsilateral primary tumors) when first breast cancer diagnosis occurred 
≤age 50 years;
○Personal history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253]/fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916]/primary peritoneal 
cancer;
○Diagnosed at any age, with ≥ [ADDRESS_1026136] and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253]/fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916]/primary peritoneal cancer at any age;
○Breast cancer diagnosed at any age with ≥ [ADDRESS_1026137]-degree

○Individual from a family with a known deleterious BRCA1/BRCA2 
mutation;
○Ashkenazi Jewish descent;
○Personal history of male breast cancer; or
○First-, second-, or third-degree male relative with breast cancer.
Note:  Patients who pre-qualify with one or more of these criteria will be eligible to screen 
for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation by [CONTACT_100672].  These subjects may be eligible for randomization upon receipt of documentation of a deleterious germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation by [CONTACT_100672].  Germline mutation testing obtained greater than [ADDRESS_1026138] 2011-002913-12

Tumor Assessments (Radiologic)
Appropriate diagnostic CT assessments using modified RECIST version 1.151for solid 
tumor response will be used in the evaluation of cases, as appropriate.  If the subject is 
unable to undergo a CT scan with IV contrast due to allergy or renal insufficiency, a non-contrast CT may be performed if the disease, especially potentially measurable lesions as present, can be appropriately evaluated.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may replace the CT imaging in cases where local laws or requirements mandate, but should have Sponsor or central imaging center approval prior to performing the MRI.
Axial plane CT scans of the full chest, abdomen, and pelvis (or MRI) to determine the 
extent of tumor burden will be performed for all tumor assessments at Screening (within 28 days of C1D1), every 9 weeks from C1D1 (tumor assessments may be conducted 8 days prior or 2 days following the scheduled assessment), and at the Final Visit (if not performed within the last 4 weeks).  For subjects on study treatment more than 5 years, tumor assessments will be conducted every 6 months (± 6 weeks) from C1D1 instead of every [ADDRESS_1026139].  Measurements should only be performed on axial imaging and lesions followed in non-axial planes should be assessed qualitatively only.
Baseline full body bone scan is required for study entry.  Subsequent bone scans will be 
performed, as clinically indicated or per the institution's standard of care.  A new bone lesion requires detection of new area of lysis, cortical destruction, or increasing soft tissue component.  New bone scan lesions will not be considered as PD, unless confirmed as increasing destruction/lytic on CT/MRI.  Increasing sclerosis will not be considered PD.  New lesions or increasing sclerosis of existing bone lesions (flare) must be evaluated by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI.
Scheduled tumor assessments will not be affected by [CONTACT_94503]/or drug 
holidays.  Subjects will continue to be monitored by [CONTACT_94563], unless evidence of tumor metastasis warrants otherwise.  Subjects

Interim Futility Analysis:  Procedures if Futility Is Declared 
An interim futility analysis will be conducted after the Week [ADDRESS_1026144] 30 subjects randomized to the veliparib + TMZ treatment arm.  If futility is declared at the time of the futility analysis for the veliparib + TMZ treatment arm, any subjects receiving veliparib + TMZ will be allowed the option of either 1) receiving 120 mg BID veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel or 2) discontinuing therapy.
Subjects who choose to receive treatment with veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel must 
be allowed at least 28 days to washout from veliparib + TMZ and will be allowed up to [ADDRESS_1026145] treatment with veliparib + TMZ and the initial dose of veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel.  The investigator will contact [CONTACT_750040] a treatment gap of more than 60 days.
For subjects who choose to receive veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel, the investigator 
must attest that the subjects continue to meet eligibility criteria and have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function as follows:

CIPN Assessment
CIPN (as assessed by [CONTACT_750026]20 questionnaire and NCI-CTCAE 4.0 
grading for peripheral neuropathy) will be assessed on C1D1, C2D1 and every other cycle thereafter beginning with Cycle 4 (C6, C8, etc.) Final Visit, and at the Follow-up Visit in subjects randomized to the veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment arms.  
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026147]'s QoL, the EORTC QLQ-C15/BR23 (including questions on 
cognition) questionnaires ( Appendix C and Appendix D ), respectively) will be 
administered at C1D1 pre-dose, C2D1, and ev ery other cycle thereafter beginning with 
Cycle 4 (C6, C8, etc.), Final Visit, and at the Follow-up Visit.  The subject will complete quality of life questionnaire worksheets.  Site personnel will check the worksheets returned by [CONTACT_750041].  If the subject is unable to complete the form, qualified site personnel may administer the questionnaires via interview and complete the worksheets for the subject.  EORTC QLQ-C15/BR23 questionnaires will no longer be administered at any visit for subjects on study treatment for more than 5 years.
The EORTC QLQ-C15/BR23 is a 38-item questionnaire that was developed to assess 
health-related quality of life among subjects with breast cancer.  Scores can be calculated from the EORTC QLQ-C15/BR23, including physical and emotional well-being, and breast symptom-specific questions.

The QLQ-C30 (30-item questionnaire) is not being used for this study; therefore, the QLQ-BR23 questionnaire administered to the study subjects will begin with question number 31.
Randomization and Subject Number Assignment
The site will contact [CONTACT_21926]/IWRS to obtain a screening (subject) number once the 
subject has signed the informed consent anda study-specific procedure has been 
performed (i.e., central labs drawn).  Once the screening number is assigned, if the subject is not randomized into the study, the reason for screen failure will be documented in the source document and will be captured in the eCRF.

Dispensation of Study Drug
Subjects randomized to the veliparib + TMZ treatment arm will receive sufficient 
quantities of veliparib for 7 days of administration in each 28-day cycle and sufficient quantities of TMZ for 5 days of administration in each 28-day cycle.  Veliparib + TMZ will be dispensed prior to dosing at each cycle (Day 1 of each cycle).
For subjects randomized to the veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment 
arms, subjects will receive sufficient quantities of veliparib or placebo for 7 days of administration in each 21-day cycle and sufficient quantities of carboplatin at a dose of AUC 6 and paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m
2.  Trained site personnel will administer the 
carboplatin + paclitaxel intravenously on Day 3 of each 21-day cycle.  Subjects will be supervised at the time of the infusion.  For subjects on study treatment more than 5 years, veliparib/placebo may be dispensed at the Day [ADDRESS_1026149] on the morning of Day 1 to reiterate the dosing instructions of veliparib/placebo. It is recommended the site contact [CONTACT_26259] [ADDRESS_1026150] about ceasing dosing.
The IVRS/IWRS will assign bottles of veliparib or placebo and bottles/cartons of TMZ 
and vials of carboplatin and paclitaxel that are supplied by [CONTACT_100676] a subject during the study from the available supply at the site.  Site personnel must contact

the IVRS/IWRS for the bottle number assignments no more than 5 days before Day 1 of 
each cycle (or Day 3 for subjects on study treatment more than 5 years who are having veliparib/placebo dispensed at Day 3).  Study medication cannot be dispensed unless the 
IVRS/IWRS is contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  [COMPANY_013] or the designee will provide specific instructions on 
the use of the IVRS/IWRS.
If carboplatin or paclitaxel is obtained commercially via the site pharmacy, the site will be 
responsible for tracking the lot numbers for all carboplatin and paclitaxel dispensed and include the information in the trial master file (TMF).
Subjects will be provided with self-administration instructions and subject dosing cards.  
Subjects will be instructed to store veliparib or placebo and TMZ according to specific directions included in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Subjects should return bottles of veliparib or 
placebo and TMZ (empty, partially filled, or full) to the study site prior to each cycle and at the Final Visit.
Post treatment Information
Post treatment information will be collected via IVRS/IWRS at monthly intervals (or as 
requested by [CONTACT_100678]) beginning on the date the subject is registered off study and for up to three (3) years until the endpoint of death, the subject has become lost-to follow-up, or [COMPANY_013] terminates the study.
All subjects will be followed for survival information (i.e., the date and cause of death) 
unless the subject requests to be withdrawn specifically from study survival follow-up; this request must be documented in the subject's medical record and signed by [CONTACT_093].
If the subject withdraws from the study follow-up, the study staff may use public

If PG testing is performed, results from individual subjects will be kept coded and 
confidential and will not be given to anyone not directly involved with this research study.  [COMPANY_013] will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  Samples will be coded so that subject identities will not be available to the scientists conducting the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_26174].  Individual subject results will not be provided to the investigator, so that neither the subject nor the investigator will have knowledge of specific subject genotypes.  [COMPANY_013] will keep the DNA samples until they are destroyed by [CONTACT_26248].  These samples will not be stored longer than 20 years.
Collection of Pharmacogenetic Sample (Optional)
One 4-mL whole blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected at C1D1 from each 
subject who consents to provide samples for PG analysis.  The procedure for obtaining and documenting informed consent is discussed in Section 9.3.
Whole blood will be collected by [CONTACT_122711], as described below:
●Collect approximately 4 mL of blood into an appropriately labeled EDTA 
tube.
●Immediately invert the collection tube 8 to 10 times to reduce the likelihood of 
clot formation.
●The sample collection tubes will be labeled as "PG Sample," with the protocol number, subject number, and study day and/or collection date.
●Store samples at –20°C or colder within 30 minutes of the blood draw until

[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Samples for Pharmacodynamic Analysis
PD correlative studies are exploratory in nature.  Serum and plasma specimens may be 
utilized to evaluate known and novel markers (nucleic acids, peptides/proteins, and metabolites) of disease status.  Additional studies may include assessment of methylation and mutational status of circulating DNA for biomarkers that correspond with patient response to treatment.  Tissue biopsies and/or circulating tumor cells may be examined for the tumor-specific alterations of cellular proteins/peptides and/or nucleic acids.  Furthermore, tumor tissues may be examined for resistance factors, including, but not limited to acquiring secondary mutations known to restore BRCA function.  [COMPANY_013] may examine the underlying causes of these alterations through determination of the amplification/mutation or methylation status of various genes, for example genes involved in DNA repair and tumor suppression.  PD variables will be further discussed in Section 5.3.8.
Blood Collection for Plasma Markers
Whole blood samples (approximately 12 mL at C1D1 and 6 mL at all other time points) will be collected by [CONTACT_750043] a peripheral venous access point to obtain plasma sample aliquots at the following time points:  pre-dose on C1D1, C2D1, Day 1 of every 10

These slides are to be stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and reviewed by [CONTACT_750044] (i.e., large regions of necrosis or areas composed primarily of fibrous connective tissue or adipose tissue are not the predominant feature).  The remaining tissue prepared for the unstained slides will be procured from the sections closest to the section that is of adequate diagnostic quality.
Included with each shipment should be a copy of the pathology report with all specific 
subject identification information removed or blacked out and a completed shipment inventory form.  The FFPE tissue block or slide boxes should be labeled with study drug number, sample matrix (tissue), protocol number, subject number, and collection date.  Slide boxes should be packaged using suitable shippi[INVESTIGATOR_750013].  If the blocks are to be returned, please provide clear instructions and the return address.
Serial Biopsies When Deemed Feasible by [CONTACT_750045] (needle, punch, or excisional) will be obtained at the C1D1 visit prior to therapy 
and at the Final Visit, when feasible, for all subjects who consent and who have readilyaccessible tumor tissue.  Because of the concern regarding increased risk associated with lung, mediastinal lymph nodes, and liver biopsies, no lung, liver, or mediastinal lymph node biopsies will be performed as part of this study.
It is preferred that at least [ADDRESS_1026163] 1 cm in length.  Alternatively, biopsies for superficial lesions (cutaneous and subcutaneous), may be obtained via punch or excisional biopsy.  For excisional and punch biopsies, a single specimen is adequate provided it can be bisected into 2 adequate samples.

Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026173] (Version 1.1) for Tumor Response
Response criteria will be assessed using RECIST (version 1.1).  Changes in the target and 
non-target lesions over the course of therapy must be evaluated using the criteria listed below.
Eligibility
Subjects with measurable or non-measurable (but radiologically evaluable) disease with at 
least one lesion outside previously irradiated areas at baseline can have objective tumor response evaluated by [CONTACT_393] (version 1.1).  Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_750047].  Lesions that have been previously irradiated will be considered non-target lesions.  If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology, if possible.
Measurability
Measurable Lesions Lesions accurately measured in at least one dimension 
with a minimum size of:  
Longest diameter ≥ 10 mm (CT scan slice thickness 
no greater than 5 mm)  
10-mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_26304]-Measurable Lesions All other lesions, including small lesions (longest 
diameter < 10 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, and abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218].
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026174] be ≥ [ADDRESS_1026175] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.
Non-Measurable Malignant Lymph NodesPathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short 
axis.
Special Considerations Regarding Lesion MeasurabilityBone lesions
Bone lesions are considered non-target lesions.
Cystic lesions
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant 
lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
"Cystic lesions" thought to represent cystic metastases can 
be considered measurable lesions if they meet the 
definition of measurability described above.  However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area will 
be considered non-target lesions.
All measurements should be taken using calipers and recorded in metric notation, if 
clinically assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and not more than 28 days prior to the beginning of treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ [ADDRESS_1026176] Sponsor/central imaging center approval.  Non-axial slices may be of value in the interpretation of paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_100631]-axial planes.  Lesions followed on non-axial imaging should be assessed qualitatively (i.e., as CR, Non-CR/Non-PD, unequivocal PD, unequivocal new, NE).  Lesions only visible on non-axial imaging are not considered suitable as target lesions.
For accurate objective response evaluation, ultrasound or bone scan should not be used to 
measure tumor lesions.
The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised.  However, such techniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained.
Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between benign and malignant fluid 
collections in cases of new and/or enlarging pleural effusion and/or ascites in which the response will be based on other target or non-target lesions.  New effusions or ascites should be considered unknown until cytology confirms whether they are benign or malignant.  If cytology is available and suggesting malignancy, the data must be entered into the eCRF and will be considered in the determination of progression.  While fluid collections are present, the response determination cannot be considered CR.

Baseline Documentation of "Target" and "Non-Target" Lesions
All measurable lesions, up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy are considered non-target lesions.
Lymph nodes merit special mention, since they are normal anatomical structures, which 
may be visible by [CONTACT_9661], even if not involved by [CONTACT_20150].  Pathological nodes, which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions (no more than 2 may be selected), must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_1026178] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example, an abdominal node, which is reported as being 20 mm × 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered 
non-target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
A sum of the diameters (SOD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum SOD.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then, as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline SOD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218].  All assessments of response (CR or PR) must be confirmed by [CONTACT_750048] 4 weeks apart.
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes and skin lesions 
should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence (stable, increasing, or decreasing) or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.

Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR)
The disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR)
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD)
At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest SOD recorded since the treatment started (baseline or after) or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must alsodemonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
Stable Disease (SD)
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest SOD since the treatment started (baseline or after).
Assessment of Target Lesions
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the "sum" of lesions may not be zero, even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < [ADDRESS_1026180] 2011-002913-12
99
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (< 5 mm).  However, sometimes target lesions or lymph nodes become too small to measure.  If it is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement should be recorded as [ADDRESS_1026181] believes that the lesion is present, but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (as derived from the 5-mm CT slice thickness).  The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible; therefore, providing this default value will prevent false responses or progression basedupon measurement error.
If interventions occur during the study that affect disease burden, such as surgery, the 
lesion(s) affected will typi[INVESTIGATOR_100632]-evaluable (NE) from that point forward and subsequent timepoints will be either NE or PD (if evidence of progression is available).
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR)
The disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  All 
lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD
Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level 
above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD)
Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.In this setting, to achieve "unequivocal progression" on the basis of non-target disease, 
there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased 
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026182] "increase" in the size of one or 
more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease, therefore, will be extremely rare.
New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression.  While there are no 
specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions, the findings of a new lesion should be unequivocal, i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, timing of scanning, phase of contrast administration, change in imaging modality, or possibly representing something other than tumor (e.g., some "new" bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions).  A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain, which reveals metastases.  The subject's brain metastases are considered evidence of progressive disease even if he or she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal (e.g., too small to measure), continued therapy and follow-up 
evaluation will clarify whether it truly represents new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Disease Progression
Disease progression will be defined as progression of disease by [CONTACT_44993] 1.1.  
Clinical data that support progression will be collected and submitted for central review (i.e., report of skin lesions measurements, cytology, bone scan).
If the subject experiences symptomatic deterioration and clinical progression is 
determined by [CONTACT_093], every effort will be made to document radiographic or clinical evidence of progression for analysis of the primary endpoint, even after 
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026183] of the study, an IDMC will review unblinded safety data.  Please refer 
to Section 8.1.9 for further details pertaining to the IDMC review.
5.3.6 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Collection and shipment of PK samples is discussed in Section 5.3.2.
Values for the PK parameters of veliparib, including maximum observed plasma 
concentration (C
max), the time of C max(peak time, T max), and the area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve (AUC) will be determined using noncompartmental methods, if the data warrant.
Additional analyses may be performed, if useful in the interpretation of the data.[COMPANY_013] or a designated laboratory will store the PK samples in a secure storage space 
with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  To increase confidence in trends, remaining sample aliquots may be used to perform replicate tests or sample analysis may be performed at additional time points for tests currently identified in the protocol.  Upon completion of this research, [COMPANY_013] or a designated laboratory will destroy the samples.
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026184]'s response to 
veliparib, or other study treatment, in terms of pharmacodynamics, efficacy, tolerability, and safety.  Such genetic factors may include genes for drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins, genes within the target pathway, or other genes believed to be related to drug response.  Some genes currently insufficiently characterized or unknown may be understood to be important at the time of analysis.  The samples may be analyzed as part of a multistudy assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to veliparib or drugs of this class.  The samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests related to veliparib (or drugs of this class).  The results of pharmacogenetic analyses may not be reported with the study summary.
5.3.8 Pharmacodynamic Variables
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy and response may be evaluated with the goal of 
defining the relationship between drug concentration, PARP inhibition, and disease status.  The biomarker analysis may include the examination of plasma and serum components such as, nucleic acids, proteins/peptides, and metabolites.  If warranted, additional studies may include the analysis of the methylation and mutational status of circulating DNA or RNA and quantification and characterization of circulating tumor cells isolated from an individual.  Characteristics of tumor tissue and tumor nucleic acids may be explored and examined in archived or fresh tissue biopsies, circulating tumor cells, and cell-free nucleic acids isolated from blood components.  These characterizations may be included, but are not limited, quantification of protein, nucleic acid, or metabolites, and characterization of gene methylation/mutational status or post-translational modification of proteins, particularly those involved in DNA repair pathways.  Samples collected during the course of this study may be banked and used in the future to investigate new scientific questions related to this study.  Additionally, the samples may be anonymized and used for diagnostic test development.  [COMPANY_013] (or a designated laboratory) will store the samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples 
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026185] 2011-002913-12
103
will be retained while research on veliparib (or drugs of this class) continues for up to but 
no longer than 20 years.
Plasma and Serum Markers
Examination of the plasma and serum components subjects on the veliparib clinical trial 
may reveal patterns of nucleic acid, protein/peptide, and metabolite concentrations that may be further evaluated in future clinical studies to determine any prognostic value and any correlation with clinical response.  Samples may be analyzed for markers (e.g., CA15-3 and HER2/NEU) that could be either prognostic or predictive of drug-response.
Stratification Markers
Genetic amplification, chromosomal loss, and/or mutational status of various genes, 
including, but not limited to those, in the DNA repair pathway represent genetic lesions potentially associated with subject outcome.  Gene and protein expression, FISH, and/or mutational methylation analysis may be conducted on tissue from archived serial biopsy tumor samples, CTC, and/or nucleic acids extracted from plasma from subjects participating in this study to assess modifications, which may prove to be informative.  The potential relationship between amplification/loss/mutation of these entities and the clinical outcome in these subjects may be examined as a patient stratification tool.
DNA methylation regulates gene expression (inactivates certain genes) and aberrant 
methylation of specific genes is associated with cancer development and poor clinical outcome.  Tumor-derived DNA may be examined for variable methylation status of genes that are known to have prognostic implications associated with subjects enrolled in this trial.  The list of potential genes includes, but is not restricted to: RASSF1A, CDH1, Cyclin D2, and TWIST.
Protein RNA and DNA Analysis on Tissue and Plasma
Tissue slides from diagnostic biopsies, serial biopsies, and CTC may be used to assess 
molecular characteristics and/or expression of protein, nucleic acids, and metabolites.  
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026186] 2011-002913-12
104
Additionally, these samples may be examined for mutations and/or methylation of nucleic 
acids.  Protein analysis of relevant proteins, including but not limited to, DNA repair proteins, such as ERCC1 and XPF, may be performed on sources of tumor tissue obtained from each consented subject when feasible.  Mutational analysis of tumor-derived DNA may include, but is not limited to, acquired secondary mutations in the BRCA genes that have been reported to restore the activity of the molecule.  These analyses might reveal putative stratification and/or resistance markers for correlation with efficacy.
If warranted, circulating tumor-derived nucleic acids may be extracted from plasma and 
quantitated and/or assessed for methylation and mutational status of genes relevant to veliparib mechanism of action, including the DNA repair genes.  Genes relevant to the mechanism of action of the combination therapy agents TMZ, carboplatin and/or paclitaxel may also be investigated.  If tumor tissue, CTCs, and plasma are available from the same patient, the results of studies will be compared to assess correlation of the methodologies.
BRCA Bridging Sample
In order to permit future bridging studies, additional samples will be collected to allow 
testing using additional assays to assess assay performance compared to other potential BRCA assays to be tested in the future.
Circulating Breast Cancer Cells
Cancer cells derived from the primary breast cancer tumor may be found circulating in the 
blood.  These tumor cells can be enriched and enumerated using cell selection and breast cancer cell labeling techniques.  The quantification and characterization at the protein and molecular levels (nucleic acids and metabolites) of these tumor cells may contain information correlated with drug-responsiveness, resistance factors, and clinical outcomes.

M12-[ADDRESS_1026187] will be withdrawn from the study, if any of the following occur:
●The subject experiences disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_270304] 1.1;
●If the subject discontinues for symptomatic deterioration, every effort will be 
made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment;
●The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject;
●Clinically significant deterioration of the subject's medical status, as determined by [CONTACT_093];
●The subject requires alternative anticancer agents, or radiation therapy for 
primary or metastatic disease;
●The subject becomes pregnant or begins breastfeeding during the treatment portion of the study;
●The subject or subject's legally acceptable representative decides to withdraw 
consent for any reason; or
●Any other medical reason that [COMPANY_013] or the investigator deems appropriate.
5.4.[ADDRESS_1026188] reaching a protocol-defined 
endpoint, the investigator will notify the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor (Section 6.5) or the 
clinical team representative (Section 7.0) via telephone, as soon as possible (provided, in 
each case, subject care and safety are not compromised).  If not notified prior to discontinuation, the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor may contact [CONTACT_26255].
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026189] report the withdrawal to the IVRS/IWRS system within [ADDRESS_1026190]'s discontinuation visit.
When a subject discontinues the study, a Final Visit will be conducted (preferably prior to 
the initiation of another anticancer therapy).  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  Following discontinuation of the study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment.
At the Final Visit, the reasons for the discontinuation from the study will be recorded and 
a physical examination, vital signs measurement, laboratory analyses, performance status, ECG (if not performed within the last 4 weeks), QoL assessment, tumor assessment (if not performed within the last 4 weeks), collection of unused study drug, and an assessment of adverse events will be performed, as soon as possible after discontinuation from the study.  For subjects on study treatment more than 5 years, 12-lead ECG, urinalysis, CIPN Assessment (QLQ-CIPN20), and EORTC QLQ-C15/BR23, and tumor assesement do not need to be performed at Final Visit.
All subjects will have one Follow-up Visit approximately [ADDRESS_1026191] had a Final Visit conducted ≥ [ADDRESS_1026192] dose of study drug. For subjects on 
study treatment more than 5 years, CIPN Assessment (QLQ-CIPN20) and EORTC QLQ-C15/BR23 do not need to be performed at the Follow-up Visit.
If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
clinically significant laboratory result, the site will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory results or adverse event is achieved.
Subjects who discontinue treatment with veliparib + TMZ or veliparib/placebo + 
carboplatin + paclitaxel prior to reaching an event of disease progression should remain on study and continue to follow the schedule for study visits and procedures until disease 
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026193] treatment information will be collected via IVRS/IWRS at 
monthly intervals (or as requested by [CONTACT_100678]) beginning on the date the subject is registered off study and continuing for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1026194] result by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours to one of the [COMPANY_013] representatives listed in Section 7.0.

If both the investigator and the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor confirm that the subject would benefit to continue treatment, the subject may continue to receive veliparib + TMZ until the subjecthas disease progression or experiences a toxicity that requires discontinuation of further treatment.  If toxicities have resulted in discontinuation of either veliparib or TMZ, both are to be discontinued.

[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of Veliparib or Placebo and Carboplatin + 
Paclitaxel
Subjects will receive veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel until reaching a 
protocol-defined event of disease progression or they experience unmanageable toxicity.  Dose reductions of carboplatin and paclitaxel w ill occur on the basis of the toxicity 
observed and may result in discontinuation of either agent (e.g., discontinuation of paclitaxel for neurotoxicity).  The subject may continue on therapy with the remaining agent in combination with veliparib.  If toxicities have resulted in discontinuation of both carboplatin and paclitaxel, veliparib will also be discontinued.  At the investigator's discretion, carboplatin and paclitaxel administration may continue after veliparib has been discontinued.
Subjects who discontinue treatment with veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel prior 
to reaching an event of disease progression should remain on study and continue to follow the schedule for study visits and procedures until disease progression is experienced.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
Survival (i.e., the date and cause of death) and post treatment information including

●If the Sponsor has decided to prematurely discontinue the study, the Sponsor 
will promptly notify in writing the investigator, as well as regulatory 
authorities of the decision and give detailed reasons for the discontinuation;
●The investigator must promptly notify the IRB/IEC and give detailed reasons 
for the discontinuation; and
●The investigator must promptly notify the enrolled subjects of the premature 
discontinuation and administer appropriate treatments, such as replacement of 
the treatment regimen by [CONTACT_100684], if applicable.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the following treatments
●Veliparib 40 mg BID Days 1 through 7 + TMZ 150 to 200 mg/m2QD Days 1 
through 5 in each 28-day cycle;
●Veliparib 80 mg (for subjects randomized under the original protocol) or

●Placebo BID Days 1 through 7 + Carboplatin AUC 6 administered on Day 3 
and Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2administered on Day 3 of each 21-day cycle.
[IP_ADDRESS] Veliparib + TMZ Treatment
Subjects will self-administer the morning dose of veliparib and TMZ at the same time 
under fasting conditions (to reduce the chance of nausea and vomiting per the TMZ label recommendation) and the evening doses of veliparib approximately [ADDRESS_1026198] 2011-002913-12
110
morning dose with or without food in the same calendar day.  For Cycle 1, the TMZ dose 
will start at a dose of 150 mg/m2QD per body surface area (BSA) on Days [ADDRESS_1026199] cycle, platelets (nadir) are > 100,000/ μL and the 
ANC (nadir) is >1,500/μ L and no Grade 3 or 4 CTCAE nonhematologic toxicities 
attributable to TMZ are observed, then the TMZ dose will be escalated to 200 mg/m2QD 
for Cycle 2.  The TMZ dose will be determined using the BSA calculated from the height obtained at the baseline evaluation and the weight obtained prior to each cycle.  The daily dose will be rounded to the nearest [ADDRESS_1026200] convenience, the dose may be rounded down to 5% from calculated dose, in order to minimize the number of capsules per dose.  The exact dose administered will be recorded in the eCRF.
It is recommended that if a subject misses a scheduled dose of veliparib and/or TMZ and 
less than [ADDRESS_1026201] passed from the time of oral dosing, then no additional doses should be taken.
[IP_ADDRESS] Veliparib + Carboplatin/Paclitaxel and Placebo + Carboplatin 
+ Paclitaxel Treatment
Subjects will self-administer the morning dose of veliparib/placebo and the evening dose 
of veliparib/placebo approximately [ADDRESS_1026202] 2011-002913-12
111
every cycle.  Paclitaxel will be infused prior to carboplatin.  Dosing of veliparib/placebo 
on Day 3 of every cycle should be done before carboplatin + paclitaxel infusion.
Paclitaxel
Allsubjects should be pretreated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H [ADDRESS_1026203] label, local 
practice, or applicable SmPC.
Paclitaxel will be administered intravenously over approximately 3 hours at a dose of 
175 mg/m2.
Carboplatin
Carboplatin will be administered intravenously over approximately 15 to 30 minutes at (AUC 6 mg/mL/min) immediately following paclitaxel infusion.
The maximum carboplatin dose will be capped as follows:Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC (mg/mL/min) × (150 mL/min)
●For a target AUC = 6, the maximum dose is 6 × 150 = 900 mg
●For a target AUC = 5, the maximum dose is 5 × 150 = 750 mg*
●For a target AUC = 4, the maximum dose is 4 × 150 = 600 mg*
* Only for subjects who have had dose modifications.
Serum creatinine as provided by [CONTACT_750049].  
Use of the central laboratory results for the calculation of carboplatin dosing is strongly encouraged.
Similarly, when the GFR is estimated using isotopic/EDTA clearance, maximum 
carboplatin dosing should be based upon standard guidelines and institutional practices.
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026204] experiences toxicity that would lead to dose reduction of carboplatin to an 
AUC of < 4, carboplatin will be discontinued.  Note that carboplatin dose will be recalculated if the subject has a weight change of greater than or equal to 10% from baseline; adjustments for weight change of < 10% are allowed per institutional guidance.

[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding of Investigational Product
The IVRS/IWRS will provide access to blinded subject treatment information for an 
individual subject in the case of a medical emergency.  In the event of a medical emergency in which the investigator believes that knowledge of study drug treatment is required, every effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_750051] (listed in Section 6.5) prior to contact[CONTACT_271382]/IWRS for treatment unblinding (as long as 
subject safety is not compromised).  The date and reason that the blind was broken must be conveyed to [COMPANY_013] and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  In the event the [COMPANY_013]Clinical Project Team should break the blind, the reason will be documented in a note to study file and on the appropriate eCRF.

Veliparib or placebo and TMZ should be taken as directed by [CONTACT_093].Carboplatin and paclitaxel will be administered intravenously by [CONTACT_1146].Subjects will be instructed to return all veliparib or placebo bottles and TMZ 
bottles/cartons (empty, partially filled, or full) to the study site personnel prior to each cycle and at the Final Visit.  The study site personnel will document the bottles/cartons of veliparib, placebo or TMZ returned and the number of capsules per bottle/carton on the appropriate form.  The bottles/cartons will be retained until the site monitor performs accountability of veliparib, placebo, TMZ, carboplatin (when supplied by [CONTACT_26282]), and paclitaxel (when supplied by [CONTACT_26282]).
The study coordinator will document compliance on the appropriate eCRF.  If the number 
of capsules taken and the number of capsules returned do not add up to the number of capsules dispensed, an explanation will be provided.
Unless otherwise directed by [CONTACT_100690], a subject will be considered
compliant with veliparib/placebo or TMZ if 80% of the assigned dose is taken during a cycle.  Compliance below 80% will require counseling of the subject by [CONTACT_26271].
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
Upon receipt of a shipment, the representative at each site will 1) open and inspect the 
shipment; 2) verify that the veliparib, placebo, TMZ, carboplatin, and paclitaxel has been received intact, in the correct amounts, and at the correct address; 3) sign and date the Proof of Receipt (POR) or similar documentation accompanying the shipment; and 
Veliparib

4) register the shipment as received via the IVRS/IWRS.  All study drugs must be retained 
in the designated secure area under proper storage conditions.  This will be documented by [CONTACT_100691]/IWRS.
An overall accountability of veliparib, placebo, TMZ, carboplatin, and paclitaxel supplied 
by [CONTACT_100692].  An accurate running inventory of veliparib, placebo, TMZ, carboplatin, and paclitaxel supplied by [CONTACT_100693], POR numbers, the bottle/carton numbers, and the date veliparib, placebo, TMZ, carboplatin, and paclitaxel were dispensed for each subject.
Upon completion or termination of the study, all original bottles/cartons containing 
unused veliparib, placebo, TMZ, carboplatin, paclitaxel (empty containers will be defaced and discarded on site) will be returned to [COMPANY_013] according to [COMPANY_013]'s instructions, or if pre-arranged between the Sponsor and site, destruction of used and unused veliparib, placebo, TMZ, carboplatin, and paclitaxel in bottles/cartons will be performed at the site.
The investigator or his or her designated representative agrees not to supply veliparib, 
placebo, TMZ, carboplatin, or paclitaxel to any persons not enrolled in the study or not named as a subinvestigator listed on the FDA [ADDRESS_1026216] the bottle number and dose of veliparib, placebo and the bottle/carton 
number and dose of TMZ or carboplatin and paclitaxel given to each subject in the source documents and on the eCRF.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is a Phase 2, randomized, partially blinded study to evaluate the efficacy and 
tolerability of veliparib in combination with TMZ and in combination with carboplatin + 
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026217] 2011-002913-12
119
paclitaxel compared to an active, placebo-controlled arm of carboplatin + paclitaxel.  The 
choice of the control group allowed for a blinded assessment of the contribution of veliparib to the safety and efficacy of the backbone regimen of carboplatin + paclitaxel.  Additionally, the design allows for the comparison of veliparib + TMZ, a regimen for which non-randomized, Phase [ADDRESS_1026218] cancer, emerging data indicate enhanced sensitivity of BRCA-mutated cells to platinums; thus, there is potential for increased activity of this regimen in this population.  The design does not allow crossover, as both PFS and OS will be assessed.
The randomization will be 1:1:1 so each arm will contain approximately the same number 
of subjects.  Randomization will be stratified on the basis of ER and/or PgR positive versus ER negative and PgR negative, prior cytotoxic therapy versus no prior cytotoxic therapy, and ECOG 0-[ADDRESS_1026219] Population
Documented BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers with histologically (or cytologically) 
confirmed locally recurrent (not amenable to therapy with curative intent) or metastatic breast cancer will be enrolled into the study.  If the subject is HER2 positive, the subject must have received and progressed on at least one prior standard anti-HER2 therapy or the subject must be ineligible to receive anti-HER2 therapy.  Subjects must have had no more than two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy agents for metastatic disease.  Subjects must have measurable or non-measurable (but radiologically evaluable) disease as defined by [CONTACT_750052] 1.1.

5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
Veliparib 40 mg BID + TMZ 200 mg/m2QD was defined as MTD combination dose in 
the Phase 1 study, M06-862.  Additionally, the veliparib PK results following the 20 and 
40 mg BID doses achieved the exposures (AUC) that were effective in murine efficacy models and PARP inhibition in humans (CTEP Phase 0).  In a Phase [ADDRESS_1026221] received veliparib 40 mg BID Days 1 through 7 plus TMZ 150 to 200 mg/m
2QD Days 1 through 5 of a 28-day 
cycle.  Because of the number of subjects with hematological toxicities, the protocol was amended in December 2009 to change the dose of veliparib from 40 mg BID to 30 mg BID.  All of the subjects who responded to veliparib + TMZ received 40 mg BID veliparib initially, then 30 mg BID following the dose reduction amendment.  The study was also amended to include an expansion cohort to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of veliparib 30 mg BID + TMZ.  To date, hematological toxicities have been similar to that observed in the initial cohort; however, the response rate has diminished.  On the basis of experience to date across the veliparib program (including Phase 2 studies in metastatic melanoma, hormone-refractory prostate cancer, and high grade serous ovarian cancer) in which hematological toxicities have been manageable with veliparib 40 mg BID and the potential decrease in efficacy at the 30 mg dose, veliparib will be used at 40 mg BID in combination with TMZ.
The initial starting dose of 80 mg BID veliparib in this trial was derived from the results 
obtained in the CTEP 7967 study.  Selection of the initial dose for this study is discussed in Section 3.4.2.
The 120 mg BID dose of veliparib was determined to be the recommended phase two dose (RPTD), based on the current data available from the GOG 9923 (Phase 1 dose escalation study in subjects with advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer) study.  As of [ADDRESS_1026222] been treated with veliparib 150 mg BID on Days 1 to 21 with carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m

evaluation period; thus, in the GOG [ADDRESS_1026224] will complete the planned activities per Section 5.3.1 until resuming treatment.  The intention 
is for veliparib to be administered concurrently with TMZ or carboplatin + paclitaxel.  Thus, if a delay in any component of the regimen is required for any reason, all drugs within the regimen should be delayed until the subject is eligible to receive all drugs.  All toxicities, with the exception of anemia, alopecia, neuropathy, and non-treatment related clinically insignificant laboratory abnormalities, should be resolved to Grade [ADDRESS_1026225] be withheld because of hematological toxicity, CBC and platelet 
counts should be obtained weekly until the counts reach the lower limits for treatment as outlined.  The treatment schedule will then proceed in the usual sequence.
Study drug interruptions for events that are clearly not related to the study drug, 
e.g., underlying cancer, planned surgical procedures, or acute viral illnesses, do not necessitate a dose reduction.  The timing of dose resumption should be at the investigator's discretion.  In the case of delays, CT scans should continue to be assessed at intervals of 9 weeks from C1D1.
Since fatigue can be a symptom of cancer progression, dose reduction for fatigue will only 
be done if the fatigue is deemed to be drug-related in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].
Investigators should evaluate subjects for carboplatin and paclitaxel or temozolomide 
treatment per the locally approved product label, local practice, or applicable SmPC.

5.7.1 Veliparib + TMZ Dose Reduction and Delays
The following are guidelines for dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation of veliparib 
(and TMZ for subjects randomized to the veliparib + TMZ treatment arm of the study (Table 12 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Veliparib Dose Reduction and Delays
●Veliparib should be discontinued at the same time as discontinuation of TMZ.
●For any subject who experiences Grade 3 or 4 toxicity that is not attributable to 
TMZ or the underlying disease, the veliparib dose will be held until the toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or lower or to baseline if Grade 2 is present at the 
time of study entry.  Two dose reductions are allowed.  The dose of veliparib 
will be reduced to 30 mg BID (dose level –1) and may be reduced again to 20 mg BID (dose level –2) for reasons of toxicity.  Any dose reduction beyond 
[ADDRESS_1026227] also be discontinued.
●Any ≥ Grade 2 event of seizure attributed to veliparib requires interruption of 
veliparib and discussion with the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor regarding the decision to resume treatment.
The [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (see Section 6.5) for subjects who 
require more than a 2-week delay in the re-initiation of the next cycle.
[IP_ADDRESS] TMZ Dose Reduction and Delays
Clinically significant hematological toxicities should result in TMZ dose reduction or 
delay.  During treatment, CBCs should be monitored and the next cycle of therapy should not be started until the ANC is > 1,500/ μL and platelet count is > 100,000/ μL.  For any 
Grade 3 or 4 toxicities attributable to TMZ, dose reduction and/or delay guidelines should be followed per Table [ADDRESS_1026228] nonhematologic toxicity observed in the previous cycle.  The 75 mg/m
2/day is the lowest dose of TMZ allowed in this study.  Subjects must stop TMZ

and veliparib if they are at the 75 mg/m2/day dose level of TMZ and require an additional 
dose reduction ( Table 12 ) because of toxicities.  Subjects will be removed from 
protocol-directed therapy if this occurs.  When TMZ is discontinued, veliparib must also 
be discontinued.

[IP_ADDRESS] Carboplatin + Paclitaxel Dose Reduction and Delays
If a dose reduction or delay is required for carboplatin and/or paclitaxel, the investigator 
should follow procedures according to institutional guidelines, the locally approved product label, local practice, or applicable SmPC.  If the investigator considers an event attributable to carboplatin and/or paclitaxel and not veliparib/placebo, the investigator may consider reducing carboplatin and/or paclitaxel, but not veliparib or placebo.  Guidelines for dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation are included in Table 13 .
Treatment should be delayed until the toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_1026233] be ≥ 1,500/mm
3and platelet count must be ≥ 100,000/mm3.  If the counts are lower than 
the limit, treatment should be delayed until recovery to the required ANC and platelet count.  Any patient whose treatment is delayed must be evaluated on a weekly basis until adequate hematologic and nonhematologic parameters have been met.  Treatment could be postponed for up to [ADDRESS_1026234] 2011-002913-12

study.
If a dose reduction of paclitaxel is needed, the dose will be decreased to 135 mg/m2for 
the first dose reduction and to 110 mg/m2for the second.  If a dose reduction of 
carboplatin is required, the dose reduction will be decreased by [ADDRESS_1026235] remains on chemotherapy (carboplatin and/or paclitaxel) following dose modifications, veliparib or placebo may be continued.  However, if both carboplatin and paclitaxel have been discontinued, then veliparib or placebo must also be discontinued.
For any Grade 3 or 4 toxicities not mentioned in the table, treatment will be withheld until 
the patient recovers to Grade 1 or baseline, and the dose of the drug(s) most likely to have caused the toxicity will be reduced per the guidelines at the beginning of Section 5.7.

6.1 Definitions
6.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical 
intervention, [meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.7) regarding toxicity 
management)] and/or if the Investigator considers them to be adverse events.
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026242] 2011-002913-12

An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during the study will not be considered 
an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry or is due to an improvement in the underlying condition.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being performed will be considered an adverse event.
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013], as 
appropriate, as a serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_1026243]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor 
medical significance, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).

require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Spontaneous Abortion Miscarriage experienced by [CONTACT_62444].
Elective Abortion Elective abortion performed on study subject.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.2 Adverse Event Severity
The study Investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4.0).
53
For adverse events not captured by [CONTACT_26277] 4.0, the Investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse event:
Mild (Grade 1) The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_1560].
Moderate (Grade 2) The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities.
Severe (Grade 3 or 4) The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
Death (Grade 5) The adverse event resulted in death of the subject (severe).
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026245] the change in 
severity.
For all reported serious adverse events that increase in severity, the supplemental CRFs 
also need to be updated and need to include the new AE serial number.
6.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:  For the purpose of this section, study drug is considered veliparib or placebo, TMZ, carboplatin and or paclitaxel.
Probably Related An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study drug 
or recurs on re-challenge and an Other cause of event is unlikely or significantly less likely.
Possibly Related An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug and an Other cause of event is equally or less likely compared to the potential relationship to study drug.
Probably Not RelatedAn adverse event has little or no temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely Other cause of event exists.
Not Related An adverse event is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another drug and is not related to the study drug (e.g., has no temporal relationship to study drug or has a much more likely Other cause of event).
For causality assessments, events meeting the categories of probably or possibly related 
will be considered "associated."  Events that are probably not or not related will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the Investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_147530], probably not, or not related to study drug is given, 
an Other cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_51053].
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026246].
Serious and nonserious adverse events, occurring after the study-specific informed 
consent is signed but prior to the initial dose of veliparib/placebo, TMZ, carboplatin or paclitaxel, will be collected only if they are considered by [CONTACT_671063].
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure [ADDRESS_1026247] 2011-002913-12

A drug-related toxicity is an adverse event or laboratory value outside of the reference 
range that is judged by [CONTACT_750058] (Section 6.1.1).
A toxicity is deemed "clinically significant" on the basis of the investigator's medical judgment.
Allergic Reaction/Hypersensitivity (Paclitaxel)
Severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnea requiring 
bronchodilators, angioedema, or generalized urticaria, require immediate discontinuation of paclitaxel and aggressive symptomatic therapy.  Subjects who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel.

All subjects who receive at least one dose of the study drug (veliparib or placebo) will be 
included in the safety analysis.
Comparisons will be performed between veliparib 40 mg BID + TMZ and placebo BID + 
carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as between veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel.
8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
8.1.1 Baseline Characteristics
All baseline summary statistics and analyses will be based on characteristics prior to the 
initiation of study drug (or randomization for non-treated subjects).  Unless otherwise stated, baseline for a given variable will be defined as the last value for that variable obtained prior to the first dose of study drug.
Baseline characteristic data will be summarized with all randomized subjects for Group 1 
(veliparib 40 mg BID + TMZ, veliparib 80 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel, placebo BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel) and Group 2 (veliparib 40 mg BID + TMZ, veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel, placebo BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel) of the study separately.
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics
Continuous demographic data (e.g., age, height, and weight) will be summarized with 
means, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range.  Frequencies and percentages will be computed for the following parameters:  gender, race, BRCA1, BRCA2, ER/PgR 
Veliparib

cytotoxic therapy use, and ECOG performance status.
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical Histories
Frequencies and percentages will be computed for each medical history parameter.
8.1.2 Efficacy Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary efficacy analysis will be a comparison of progression-free survival (PFS) 
between veliparib + TMZ and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as between 
veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel among subjects who have been documented to have deleterious mutations by [CONTACT_100649].  Comparisons between treatment groups will be performed using a Hochberg testing procedure for multiplicity adjustment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details).
For a given subject, time to PFS will be defined as the number of days from the date the subject was randomized to the date the subject experiences a confirmed event of disease progression (as determined by [CONTACT_63379]), or to the date of death (all causes of mortality), if disease progression is not reached.  All confirmed events of disease progression will be included, regardless of whether the event occurred while the subject was still taking study drug or had previously discontinued study drug.  Events of death will be included for subjects who had not experienced a confirmed event of disease progression, provided the death occurred within [ADDRESS_1026257] available disease progression assessment (by [CONTACT_750025]).  If the subject does not have a confirmed event of disease progression and the subject has not died as defined above, the subject's data will be censored at the date of the subject's last available disease progression assessment (by [CONTACT_750025]).

[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
Secondary efficacy analyses comparing the effects of veliparib + TMZ and placebo + 
carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as between veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel on the following set of endpoints will be performed:  overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR) through the end of Week 18, objective response rate (ORR), and CIPN.  Only subjects with deleterious mutations documented by [CONTACT_750060].
Time to death (overall survival) for a given subject will be defined as the number of days 
from the date the subject was randomized to the date of the subject's death.  All events of death will be included, regardless of whether the event occurred while the subject was still taking study drug or after the subject discontinued study drug.  If a subject has not died, the data will be censored at the date last known to be alive.
Clinical benefit rate (CR, PR, SD or Non-CR/Non-PD) at Week 18 will be defined as the 
progression-free rate at 18 weeks from the Kaplan-Meier curve for time to progression (defined as from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression as determined by [CONTACT_750025]).  Time to progression will be defined as the number of days from the date the subject was randomized to the date the subject experiences a confirmed event of disease progression (as determined by [CONTACT_63379]).  If a subject does not have a confirmed event of disease progression, the subject's data will be censored at the date of the subject's last available disease progression assessment (by [CONTACT_750025]).  All ITT subjects who had deleterious mutations documented by [CONTACT_750061].
Objective response rate is calculated as the proportion of subjects who have confirmed PR 
or CR based on assessment by [CONTACT_63379].  All ITT subjects who have at least one measurable lesion at baseline and had deleterious mutations documented by [CONTACT_750061].

[IP_ADDRESS] Tertiary Efficacy Endpoints
In addition to the primary and secondary efficacy analyses, tertiary efficacy analyses will 
be performed comparing the effects of veliparib + TMZ and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel on quality of life and performance status.  All ITT subjects will be included in the analysis.
8.1.3 Timing of Efficacy Analyses and Safety Evaluations
Timing of efficacy analyses and safety evaluations will be based on data from Group 2 of 
the study only.
When both the 159
thPFS event across all three treatment arms (if the veliparib + TMZ 
treatment arm is not terminated due to futility) and the 112thPFS event in the double-blind 
portion of the study occur, there will be a final review of the eCRF data.  When the data 
are reviewed for completeness and all data management quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) procedures are performed, the randomization schedule will be released and clinical database data will be extracted for documentation and statistical analyses of the efficacy and safety data.  For all efficacy analyses, the data cutoff date will be the date of the159
thPFS event across all three treatment arms (if the veliparib + TMZ 
treatment arm is not terminated due to futility) or the 112thPFS event in the double-blind 
portion of the study, whichever is later.  The exact data cutoff date will be specified in the SAP.
The clinical study report (CSR) will summarize the results from the above analyses.Overall survival will be collected on all subjects for a minimum of 3 years after they 
discontinue from the study.  After a total of 194 death events across all three treatment arms (if the veliparib + TMZ treatment arm is not terminated due to futility) or a total of 136 death events for the double-blind portion of the study, whichever is later.  The clinical database data will be extracted once again for documentation and a "Final OS Analysis" will be performed on this dataset.  The exact data cutoff date will be specified in the SAP.

8.1.4 Primary Analysis of Efficacy
The distribution of PFS (PFS as determined by [CONTACT_63379], as detailed in 
Section 5.3.3) will be estimated for each treatment group using Kaplan-Meier 
methodology and compared between veliparib + TMZ and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as between veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment groups using the log-rank test, stratified by [CONTACT_89482]/PgR (ER and/or PgR positive versus ER and PgR negative) and prior cytotoxic therapy use (yes versus no).
8.1.[ADDRESS_1026261] to multiple comparison adjustments using the fixed sequence testing method, with analyses performed in the following order:  OS, ORR, CBR through the end of Week 18, and CIPN.  For each secondary endpoint, Hochberg testing procedure will be used to preserve the family-wise error rate for multiple comparisons.
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall Survival
The distribution of overall survival will be estimated for each treatment group using 
Kaplan-Meier methodology and compared between veliparib + TMZ and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as between veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel using the log-rank test, stratified by [CONTACT_89482]/PgR (ER and/or PgR positive versus ER and PgR negative) and prior cytotoxic therapy use (yes versus no).
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Benefit Rate
Clinical benefit rate (CR, PR, SD or Non-CR/Non-PD) at Week [ADDRESS_1026262] 2011-002913-12
144
(defined as from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression as 
determined by [CONTACT_750025]).  A test statistic based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of the progression-free probability at 18 weeks (Rx Day 126) and the estimated variance will be constructed to test the null hypothesis that the clinical benefit rate at Week 18 for the two treatment groups (between veliparib + TMZ and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as between veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel) are the same.  Clinical benefit rate (CR, PR, SD, or Non-CR/Non-PD) will be computed for all ITT subjects.
[IP_ADDRESS] Objective Response Rate
The objective response rate (CR and PR) will be computed for all ITT subjects with at 
least one measurable lesion at baseline.  The proportion of subjects with a confirmed complete or partial objective response based on the RECIST version 1.1 criteria in Section 5.3.3 will be estimated for each treatment group and compared between the 
treatment groups (veliparib + TMZ and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel) using CMH test stratified by [CONTACT_89482]/PgR (ER and/or PgR positive versus ER and PgR negative) and prior cytotoxic therapy use (yes versus no).  In addition, 95% confidence interval will be constructed for ORR.

8.1.6 Tertiary Analyses of Efficacy
[IP_ADDRESS] Quality of Life
The quality of life instrument EORTC QLQ-C15/BR23 will be summarized appropriately, 
as identified in published literature.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Performance Status
Analyses of changes from baseline will be performed for each scheduled postbaseline 
visit and for the Final Visit for ECOG performance status using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as the factor and baseline value as a covariate.  Postbaseline measurements more than seven days after the last dose of study drug will not be included.  Subjects that do not have a baseline measurement or do not have any postbaseline measurements will not be included.
8.1.7 Additional Efficacy Analyses
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed using all randomized 
subjects' data, regardless whether or not the subject has deleterious mutation confirmed by [CONTACT_100649].
In addition to the stratified log-rank test for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, 
the unstratified log-rank test, Wilcoxon test, and the Cox proportional hazards model may be used for the comparison of PFS and overall survival between veliparib + TMZ and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as between veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel.
PFS, ORR, CBR, and duration of overall response based on radiological and clinical

Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026264]'s initiation of other anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  These modified 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the same methodology as detailed in previous sections.
For PFS and OS, additional analyses may also be performed, such as 1) including only 
data and events occurring on treatment or within [ADDRESS_1026265] dose of study drug, 2) using a Cox proportional hazard model to explore the effect of baseline factors including (but not limited to) the following:  ER/PgR status, BRCA1/2 status, prior cytotoxic therapy use, ECOG performance status, stage of the disease, and others, 3) subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_89482]/PgR status, BRCA1/2 status, prior cytotoxic therapy use, ECOG performance status, stage of the disease, and others, 4) stratified log-rank test by [CONTACT_11338] (US versus non-US), and ECOG performance status (0 to 1 versus 2), and 5) using interval censoring methods to analyze PFS.
Alternative statistical analyses may be performed if deemed necessary and helpful in 
understanding the drug effect.
8.1.8 Interim Analysis
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will review the safety data for this 
veliparib Phase [ADDRESS_1026266] one of the criteria:
●Received two cycles of treatment
●Reached an event of disease progression
●Discontinued the study due to toxicity/adverse events 
Subsequent reviews will be based on recommendations from the IDMC.
In addition, an interim futility analysis will be conducted after the Week [ADDRESS_1026267] one measurable lesion at baseline and randomized to the veliparib + TMZ treatment group (across both Group [ADDRESS_1026268] 2011-002913-12
147
Group 2).  This interim futility analysis will be reviewed by [CONTACT_184160].  If there are less than 
5 responders (CR+PR) in the 30 subjects, then futility will be declared for the veliparib + TMZ treatment group.  This futility criterion corresponds to Bayesian posterior probability of at least 90% that the true objective response is ≤ 25%.
If futility is declared at the time of the futility analysis, any remaining subjects on veliparib + TMZ will be given the option either to receive veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel or discontinue therapy.
8.1.9 Safety Assessments
The safety of veliparib + TMZ, veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel, and placebo + 
carboplatin + paclitaxel will be assessed by [CONTACT_100651], adverse events, serious adverse events, and all deaths, as well as changes in laboratory determinations and vital sign parameters.  Subjects who were randomized but did not receive study drug (veliparib or placebo) will not be included in the analyses of safety.
Safety summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] (veliparib 40 mg BID + TMZ, 
veliparib BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel or placebo BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel) for Group 1 and Group 2 of the study, separately.  In addition, the safety data from the veliparib 40 mg BID + TMZ group in both Group 1 and Group 2 of the study may be combined. 
Statistical comparisons will only be made for Group 2 of the study.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Analyses of adverse events will include only "treatment-emergent" events, i.e., those that 
have an onset on or after the day of the first dose of study drug (veliparib or placebo).  Analyses will not include those that have an onset greater than [ADDRESS_1026270] dose of study drug.
Treatment-emergent adverse events will be coded and summarized by [CONTACT_26293] (MedDRA)
54adverse event coding dictionary.  The percentage of subjects experiencing 
an adverse event at a given severity, NCI CTCAE version 4.0 toxicity grade, and relationship to study drug will be provided.  Comparisons of the percentages of subjects experiencing an adverse event between veliparib + TMZ and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as between veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel will be performed using Fisher's exact test.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse events will be summarized using the same methods as adverse events 
described above in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
The number of subject deaths will be summarized 1) for deaths occurring while the 
subject was still receiving study drug in this study, 2) for deaths occurring off treatment within [ADDRESS_1026271] dose of study drug, and 3) for all deaths in this study regardless of the number of days after the last dose of study drug.
[IP_ADDRESS] Longitudinal Analyses of Laboratory and Vital Signs Data
Changes from baseline will be analyzed for each scheduled postbaseline visit and for the 
final visit for blood chemistry and hematology parameters, as well as urinalysis and vital sign parameters.  If more than one measurement exists for a subject on a particular day, an arithmetic average will be calculated.  This average will be considered to be that subject's 
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026272] any postbaseline measurements will not be included.  Comparisons of the differences in mean changes from baseline between veliparib + TMZ and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as between veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel will be made using ANCOVA with treatment group as the factor and baseline as a covariate.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of Laboratory Data Using NCI CTCAE
Where applicable, blood chemistry and hematology determinations will be categorized 
according to NCI CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_1026273] NCI CTCAE grade will be used in the assessment of shift.  Comparisons of the number of subjects experiencing a shift from baseline grades of 0 to 2 or no grade to maximum postbaseline grades of 3 to 4, and from baseline grades of 0 to 2 or no grade to final postbaseline grades of 3 to 4 between veliparib + TMZ and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as between veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel will be performed using Fisher's exact tests.  Additional analyses including all measurements collected, regardless of the number of days after the last dose of study drug, will be performed.

sign values according to the [COMPANY_013]-defined criteria for vital sign values will be provided.  All measurements collected, regardless of the number of days after the last dose of study drug, will be included in these listings.
[IP_ADDRESS] Multiplicity Adjustments
The Hochberg testing procedure will be used to preserve the family-wise error rate for 
multiple comparisons.  For the primary endpoint PFS, a Hochberg testing procedure will be used where the larger Pvalue for the comparisons of veliparib + TMZ and placebo + 
carboplatin + paclitaxel as well as veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel will be compared to an α  = 0.05.  If statistically significant, 
(P≤0.05) then both comparisons will be considered significant.  If the larger Pvalue is 
not statistically significant, then the smaller Pvalue will be compared to an α = 0.025.  
Nominal Pvalues will be reported.  Furthermore, if both veliparib treatment groups are 
statistically better than the placebo group for primary efficacy endpoint PFS, fixed-sequence testing method and Hochberg testing procedure will be used for the secondary endpoints.
An additional multiplicity issue is introduced through the multiple testing of the OS 
endpoint.  It is anticipated that, at the analysis time of the primary efficacy endpoint PFS, there will be too few deaths to support an adequately powered OS analysis.  Therefore, two OS analyses are planned, the first one based on the "Primary PFS Analysis" database, and the second one based on the "OS Analysis" database (with a total of 183 deaths).  Statistical significance for OS will be declared if a significant result is obtained for either analysis, consistent with group-sequential testing methods.

veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment group is 0.[ADDRESS_1026280] 80% power at 2-sided αlevel of 0.[ADDRESS_1026281] for the veliparib 40 mg 
BID + TMZ treatment group or the veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment group using the log-rank test for OS.  If the veliparib 40 mg BID + TMZ treatment group is terminated for reasons of futility, a total of 136 death events in the double-blind portion of the study will provide approximately 80% power at 2-sided αlevel of 0.05 (or 74% power at 2-sided α level of 0.025) to detect a statistically 
significant treatment effect for the veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment group using the log-rank test for OS.

10.1 Source Documents
Source documents are defined as original documents, data and records.  This may include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory data/information, subjects' diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing and other records, recorded data from automated instruments, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, and/or x-rays.  Data collected during this study must be recorded on the appropriate source documents.
The QoL questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C15/BR23 and CIPN20) will be completed by [CONTACT_750064].  
The Investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study-related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB 
review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data documents.
10.2 Case Report Forms
Case report forms (CRF) must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this 
study.  These forms will be used to transmit information collected during the study to 
Veliparib
M12-[ADDRESS_1026287] 2011-002913-12
155
[COMPANY_013] and regulatory authorities, as applicable. The CRF data for this study are being 
collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system called Rave®provided by [CONTACT_26298], NY, [LOCATION_003].  The EDC system and the study-specific electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will comply with Title [ADDRESS_1026288] data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by [CONTACT_26299].  All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by [CONTACT_26300].
The Investigator or an authorized member of the Investigator's staff will make any 
necessary corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date and person performing the corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which is part of the EDC system.  For any correction, a reason for the alteration will be provided.  The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by [CONTACT_26301] (or their representatives).  [COMPANY_013] (or their representatives) will also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the study in order to verify eCRF entries.  The Investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide his or her electronic signature [CONTACT_100731].
Medidata will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the trial through a 
password-protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from Investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the Investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data.  It will be possible for the Investigator to make paper printouts from that media.

 1. Background and rationale for the study  
Glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a critical housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_117811] [1, 2]. The most common human enzyme defect is G6PD deficiency, which affects more than 400 million 
people worldwide [3]. Red blood cells are especially vulnerable to the effects of these mutations because they cannot 
replenish their supplies of the enzyme once they mature and en ter the bloodstream. As a result, these cells are 
susceptible to hemolysis when subjected to oxidative stress, which can occur after therapy with the anti -malarial 8 -
aminoquinolines such as primaquine, a few antibiotics, and some anti -inflammatories. Hemol ysis can also be 
activated by [CONTACT_117828], including foods (e.g., fava beans), henna, and some infections (e.g., hepatitis A 
or B, pneumonia, and typhoid fever). In newborns, G6PD deficiency is often first manifested as jaundice resulting 
from h yperbilirubinemia, which, if unchecked, can lead to kernicterus, a form of brain damage. In 1989, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) working group on G6PD deficiency recommended that when possible, newborns should 
be screened for G6PD deficiency where G6P D deficiency is common [4]. As a genetic disorder, the prevalence of 
G6PD deficiency varies among different racial and ethnic groups. In U.S. populations, an overall prevalence of G6PD 
deficiency of 2.5% among males and 1.6% among females has been observed  [5]. The highest prevalence of G6PD 
deficiency was among African American males (12.2%), Asian males (4.3%), and African American females (4.1%).  
G6PD status is particularly relevant for the treatment and prevention of malaria. Malaria is prevented and tr eated 
using a variety of treatments, some of which pose a high risk to those with G6PD deficiency. The 8 -aminoquinoline –
based malaria drugs for treatment and prophylaxis such as primaquine and tafenoquine are the only ones with the 
capacity to prevent rela pse and eliminate the liver stage parasites in Plasmodium (P.) vivax  infections. Due to the 
risks associated to G6PD deficiency for primaquine, WHO recommends that “the G6PD status of patients should be 
used to guide administration of primaquine for preven ting relapse” [ 6].  
Current tests for measuring G6PD activity are complex and require sophisticated laboratory facilities to execute [ 7-
10]. Quantitative enzyme activity -based tests are considered by [CONTACT_726330] 
(FDA) as the  true gold standard for classifying G6PD status in individuals. The Pointe Scientific test (Cat No. G7583) 
is one of the few FDA -cleared products which use the accepted gold standard assay conditions for evaluation of 
novel G6PD tests. The Pointe Scientifi c test (Cat No. G7583) run in a College of American Pathologists (CAP) 
certified laboratory will be used as the reference standard for the evaluation.  
PATH is working with SD Biosensor to advance an in vitro  diagnostic test for G6PD deficiency that meets t he target 
product profile [ 11]. Recent studies performed in the US, Thailand, and Bangladesh confirm the performance of this 
test on venous potassium EDTA anti -coagulated blood samples [ 12]. This study aims to confirm the performance of 
this test across ca pi[INVESTIGATOR_726324] G6PD activity and hemoglobin 
in capi[INVESTIGATOR_726323].  
2. Study objectives  
The goal of this study is to contribute to a body of evidence that will support the submission of the point of care G6PD 
test to the US FDA, WHO prequalification (PQ) process , and  for product registration in target countries.  
The primary objective is to assess the accuracy of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test  in measuring G6PD 
activity and classifying results when used by [CONTACT_726331] .  This study aims to establish performance 
characteristics for SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test . Results from the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test  
will be compared to results from an FDA -cleared quantitative G6PD assay and FDA-cleared hemoglobin assay  to 
assess the accuracy of a point -of-care (POC) G6PD test compared to a reference assay and across repeated 
measurements in capi[INVESTIGATOR_726323].   
3. Study design  
This is a prospective cross -sectional diagnostic accuracy study  with a nested repeatability study  and a nested sample 
stability study . Study endpoints include:  
 PROTOCOL_G6PD validation in  anti-coagulated blood _v.2.0_201912 16 7 
 • Sensitivity and specificity of SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test  compared to the Pointe Scientific G6PD 
Reference Assay for identifying G6PD deficient individual s and women with intermediate G6PD activity  
• Accuracy between the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test  in different whole blood specimen types and the 
Pointe Scientific G6PD reference assay for the measurement of G6PD activity  
 
• Accuracy between the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test  measure of Hb and HemoCue® Hb 201+ System,  
a POC reference hemoglobin assay  
 
Repeatability study:  
• Mean value for each instrument, and for the instruments combined  
• SD value for each instrument, and for the instruments combined  
• %CV value for each instrument, and for the instruments combined  
• Mean value for each operator, and for the operators combined  
• SD value for each operator, and for the operator combined  
• %CV value for each operator, and for the operator combined  
 
Sample stability study  
• Change over time in SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test result for each specimen, stored at one of two 
temperatures, by [CONTACT_14181] -coagulant, analyte, and level.  
3.1 Sample size  
The sample size for this study is based on the expected prevalence of G6 PD deficiency and on data requirements set 
by [CONTACT_726332] [ 13]. This requires obtaining samples from 
participants with a range of G6PD activity levels. The WHO PQ process defines these levels as shown in Table 1. 
Table 1. G6PD activity thresholds.  
Sex Level  Threshold  
Female  Deficient  G6PD activity <30% of the adjusted male median  
Female  Intermediate  G6PD activity 30% to 80% of the adjusted male median  
Female  Normal  G6PD activity >80% of the adjusted male median  
Male  Deficient  G6PD activity <30% of the adjusted male median  
Male  Normal  G6PD activity >30% of the adjusted male median  
Abbreviation: G6PD, glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase . 
According to the target product profile, the novel POC G6PD will need to be at least 95% sensitive for detecting 
G6PD activity levels at 30% to 80% of normal enzyme activity  and 99% sensitive for detecting individuals with G6PD 
activity < 30% activity of normal enzyme activity . Assuming a sensitivity of 9 9%, with a confidence interval of 95%, 
and a 1 .5% maximum margin of  error, a minimum of 16 9 participants with deficient and intermediate G6PD activity 
will be needed for the analysis . To account for any possible device/diagnostic failures or compromised blo od samples 
due to insufficient blood, signs of blood degradation, or contamination, the sample size is increased by 20%.  
The estimated prevalence of G6PD activity at less than 30% of normal enzyme activity can be up to 12 % in certain 
subpopulations [14,5]. In this study , testing a minimum of 2 50 and maximum of 300 African American  individuals is 
expected to generate approximately 10-25 deficient and 15-20 intermediate individuals. Targeted enrollment of up to 
50 African American women after the minimum of 250 participants is reached is intended to help yield intermediate 
individuals. These data will be combined with data  generated  in other clinical evaluation s in the US, Ethiopia , Brazil 
and one other international site . The additional evaluations will include approximately 3,000 total participants with  200 
expected deficient and 200 intermediate individuals.  
 PROTOCOL_G6PD validation in  anti-coagulated blood _v.2.0_201912 16 8 
 The nested repeatability study will be conducted with up to 20  participant s with G6PD activity levels across the 
analytical measuring range. 15 participants with complete analyzable data from the repeatability measurements are 
needed for the analysis.  
The nested sample stability study will be conducted with up to 8 participants with G6PD and/or Hb levels across the 
analytical measuring range. 5 different levels  of G6PD and Hb from participants with complete analyzable data from 
the sample stability measurements are needed for the analysis. Depending on an individual’s values, thi s could be 
accomplished in as few as 3 participants.  
3.2 Study sites  
All clinical  procedures including  enrollment, sample collection and other site -specific procedures will be conducted  at 
Biological Specialty Company (BSC) in Reading  and/or All entown , Pennsylvania . The BSC study site s are donation 
center s with expertise in Anatomic and Blood Banking/Transfusion Medicine as well as previous studies regarding the 
specificity for point of care devices used to detect infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.  The Reading center  
sees approximately 30 -40 walk -in donors per day  and the Allentown center sees approximately 15 walk -in donors per 
day. The study site serves an urban blood donor population that is primarily a mixture of students, blue -collar 
workers, and currently unemployed/underemployed individuals. Approximately 15-20% of the donation center s’ 
volunteers are African American.  Roughly a quarter to a third of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_726325].   
The University of Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine will provide reference laboratory services.  G6PD 
reference testing will be performed at the Department’s laboratories at the University of Washington Medica l Center

 • A spectrophotom eter capable of me asuring at 340 nm with a temp erature-controlled cuvette compartment is 
required to perfo rm the  assay. 
• To determine G6PD activity, which is reported in terms of grams of Hb or the number of r ed blood cells, the Hb or 
red blood cell  count must be determined separately from p erforming the G6PD assay. Calculations are then 
performed to obtain the G6PD activity. For purposes of this st udy, the G6PD activity from the Pointe S cientific kit 
will be  calculated in te rms of grams of Hb.

 PROTOCOL_G6PD validation in  anti-coagulated blood _v.2.0_201912 [ADDRESS_991885] will be determined by 
[CONTACT_726336]  [15]. For purposes of the analysis of the performance of the investigational 
G6PD test, normal (100%) w ill be defined by  [CONTACT_726337], which will be calculated as the median of 
males with >30% activity of the total male population median G6PD activity.  This threshold was chosen in order to 
align with WHO guidance and to ensure that all male defi cients are excluded from this population.  
In order to investigate the performance of the assay to distinguish females with intermediate activity from female with 
normal activity, the sensitivity and specificity will be determined at G6PD activity threshold s of 70% and 80%. 70% 
refers to the threshold used in the clinical trials for tafenoquine as a cure to P. vivax , and 80% refers to the most 
recent WHO G6PD phenotype classification.  
For the purposes of this study, an individual will be considered G6PD def icient (case) if they test positive by [CONTACT_726338].  The primary success criterion will be focused on the ability 
to identify G6PD deficient samples  correctly, such that  the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test  on finger stick 
blood and the spectrophotometric gold standard test on venous blood should both accurately identify all severe ly 
G6PD  deficient specimens (with <30% normal) as deficient.  
An adjusted male median will be calculated for the spectrophotometric g old standard test ; from this median,  the 30%, 
70%, and 80% cutoff levels will be used to categorically define G6PD  deficient cases.  
To quantify the accuracy between the POC G6PD test and the spectrophotometric gold standard test, receiver 
operating charac teristic (ROC) curves will be plotted for each G6PD threshold activity (30%, 70% and 80%). The area 
under the curve (AUC) will be used to evaluate the clinical performance of the POC G6PD test.  
Sensitivity will be determined using the following method:  
• TP = true positive (positive by [CONTACT_117841] G6PD test).  
• FN= false negative (positive by [CONTACT_726339] G6PD 
test).  
• Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN)  
Speci ficity will be determined by [CONTACT_117843]:  
• FP = false positive (negative by [CONTACT_726340] G6PD test).  
• TN = true negative (negative by [CONTACT_726341] G6PD test).  
• Specificity = TN/(TN+FP)  
Sensitivity and specificity results will be reported using 95% confidence intervals.  
In addition, Youden’s index (the point on the ROC curve where both sensitivity and specificity are maximized) will 
also be estimat ed to determine the optimal cutoff point of the POC G6PD test at 30%, and sensitivity and specificity 
will be calculated for the entire population and separately for males and females.  As the 70% and 80% threshold 
levels are only applicable to females, Yo uden’s index to determine the optimal cutoff point of the POC G6PD test at 
70% and 80%, will be restricted to the female population. Hence, the sensitivity and specificity and corresponding 
using 95% confidence intervals at 70% and 80% activity, will be es timated only for females.   
 PROTOCOL_G6PD validation in  anti-coagulated blood _v.2.0_201912 [ADDRESS_991886] will be plotted, and an R -squared value will be determined. The following R -
squared values will be consider ed acceptable:  
1.

gold standar d value, will be used together with the 95% limits of agreement. Acceptable limits of agreement for Hb 
should be within +/ -1.0 g/dL (based on a 6% estimate for allowable method bias) and for G6PD activity should be 
within +/ -2.0 U G6PD/g Hb (based on a 15%  estimate for allowable method bias). The number, percent (95% 
confidence intervals) of samples within and outside these limits will be assessed.   
No more than 15% of all samples should fall outside of these limits. Due to the importance of correctly class ifying 
intermediate and deficient patients, 99% of all deficient samples and 95% of all intermediate samples are expected to 
be within these limits. No more than 5% of female normal samples should be misclassified as intermediates.  
All statistical analyse s will be performed using Stata 13.0.

from the reference laboratory will be provided as lab -generated source documents .  
Each week, upon completion of all testing, d ata from the paper forms  for the primary study will be entered into a 
Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) electronic database system that is 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, and 
HIPAA -compliant.  Data from the paper forms for the nested repeatability study will be recorded into an Exce l 
template. Specific procedures for transferring electronic instrument data will be described in study -specific Data 
Management Plan and training materials. Electronic study records will be deidentified upon completion of data 
collection.  
8.2.2 Data acces s 
The participants will be identified by a study identification number and the participant  (clinical) identification number in 
the study database.  The name [CONTACT_726346]. 
The databa se linking the volunteer’s clinical identification number to the study identification number will be kept by [CONTACT_726342]. All records will be kept locked and all databases will 
be password protected suc h that clinic staff and study staff will have access to their respective databases.  
Direct access will be granted to authorized representatives from PATH , host institutions , and the regulatory 
authorities to permit trial -related monitoring, audits , and ins pections.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_991894] protected.  
8.2.4 Quality control and quality assurance  
The study will be conducted in a ccordance with the current approved protocol, International Council  on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP), relevant regulations and standard operating procedures.  
Regular monitoring will be performed according to ICH GCP. Data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol 
and accuracy in relation to source documents. Study data will be aggregated into a database and PATH will generate 
a monitoring report every two weeks summarizing key indicators for data quality and study compliance.  These 
indicators include but are not limited to the number of participants consented, the number of samples acquired, any 
deviations from study procedures, and corrective actions t aken. Following written standard operating procedures  
(SOPs) , the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted,  and data are generated, documented and reported 
in compliance with the protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. In  addition, a PATH representative 
will conduct site monitoring visits as needed to ensure compliance with the protocol and relevant SOPs.  
9. Benefit and risk considerations  
9.[ADDRESS_991895] their G6PD status tested by a reference assay. This infor mation may inform the  health  care they 
receive in the future.  
G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition that provides valuable clinical information for multiple clinical conditions 
beyond malaria treatment. If clinically relevant results are determined by [CONTACT_3433] e reference assay —that is, if G6PD activity 
is determined to be deficient or intermediate —participants will receive counseling regarding this information.  
 PROTOCOL_G6PD validation in  anti-coagulated blood _v.2.0_201912 [ADDRESS_991896] that has  European Conformity certification ( CE 
mark ) regulatory approval and likely to r eceive an exemption from the Investigational Device Exemption.  
The study will involve collection of venipuncture and capi[INVESTIGATOR_726327] . Only commercially available 
specimen collection products will be utilized, and the specimen collection metho ds will be those normally employed 
by a physician, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. As such, study procedures do not represent significant risks to the participants 
beyond those that are associated with normal blood draws,  such as pain, discomfort, feelin g light-heade d, fainting, 
and infection at the site of finger stick or venipuncture . The risks associated with blood draws will be mitigated 
through adherence to standard clinic procedures for infection control and using research staff who have been trained 
in best practices for blood collection. The volume of blood drawn as part of the study procedures is within the safety 
limits recommended by [CONTACT_726343]  [16]. All decisions regarding clinical care will be 
made through referral to the local health care facilities.   
There is a risk that the confidentiality of participant data will be compromised. The specimens will be inventoried and 
stored by [CONTACT_726344] a study key. Individually identifiable protected health information or data will not be shared , 
expect when required during audits by [CONTACT_117852] . All testing 
results will be filed and transferred to the study database as deidentified. Results  from the investigational test, may 
not be used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by [CONTACT_20904], medically established 
diagnostic product or procedure .  
The study staff are at risk for exposure to blood -borne pathogens in the cou rse of their work. All study team members 
will adhere to standard procedures for infection control. Study staff exposed to blood -borne pathogens during the 
course of their study roles will follow their institutional guidelines for post -exposure prophylaxis . 
10. Study safety and monitoring  
We anticipate that this evaluation poses minimal risk to participants, as it does not involve any medical intervention 
and blood draw volumes are within acceptable ranges. No data safety monitoring board will be used. The stu dy team  
will conduct necessary staff training on study procedures prior to initiating the evaluation. Only trained users who 
have been certified as proficient in the use of the test will be involved in blood collection. The information participants 
will pr ovide in the context of this evaluation is not considered sensitive and  sharing it will not pose any significant risk 
to them personally or professionally.  
 
10.1 Adverse Event s  
 
10.1.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE):  Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom , or 
disease in a participant  that is temporally associated with the use of an investigational product or procedures, even if 
the event is not considered to be related to th e study product or procedures.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An SAE is any AE occurring during study participation that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
- Death  
- Life Threatening (refers to any event in which the participant  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
- Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
- Persistent or significant disability or incapacitation (refers to any event which r esults in a substantial and/or 
permanent disruption of the participant ’s ability to carry out normal life functions)  
 PROTOCOL_G6PD validation in  anti-coagulated blood _v.2.0_201912 16 21 
 - Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage  
- Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
- Important medical event that may require inter vention to prevent one of the preceding conditions.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE):  Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates 
to the rights, safety, or welfare of participants . Refer to Protocol Section 8.2 (for a list of anticipated adverse events, 
signs or symptoms. (21CFR -812.3(s))  
 
10.1.2 Adverse Event management  
Some reported or observed signs and symptoms are inherent to blood specimen collection and are likely to occur 
transiently for nearly all participants  in this study. Such signs or symptoms will not be considered AEs as long as they 
are mild (transient, eas ily tolerated, no interference with daily activities). The following will not be considered AEs:  
- Mild, self -limited pain, swelling, bruising, or brief and minimal bleeding at the collection site  
- Lightheadedness or fainting  
- Nausea and/or vomiting  
 
However,  these signs and symptoms must be considered AEs and documented on the Adverse Event CRF should 
any of them occur in such a way that the extent or nature of the experience exceeds that normally associated with the 
procedure, as judged by [CONTACT_978], or the eve nt meets the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  For example, a ny 
injury that occur s as a result of fainting would be considered an A E. 
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_991897] be 
comprehensively documented in the CRF and on the SAE form, if applicable, and reported. This includes AEs related 
to marketed study products. The following information about the event is to be reported on the AE CR F: 
- Seriousness, classified as: Non -Serious or Serious  
- Severity,  classified as:  
o Mild: Transient symptoms, easily tolerated, no interference with daily activities  
o Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with daily activities, tolerable  
o Severe: Considerable interference with daily activities, intolerable  
- Relationship, to the study product or study procedures:  
o Not Related: Evidence suggests absolutely no possible causal relationship between the event and 
the investigational study device ( or procedures).  
o Unlikely Related: Evidence suggests that other possible causes or contributing etiological factors 
may have caused the event other than the investigational study device (or procedures).  
o Possibly Related: Evidence suggests a causal relations hip between the event and the 
investigational study device (or procedures) cannot be ruled out  
o Related: Evidence suggests a reasonable causal relationship between the event and the device (or 
procedures) is likely  
 
In addition, the following should be recorded for each AE:  
- Action(s) taken to remedy the AE, including change in study treatment or participation, or medical/surgical 
treatments  
- Duration of the AE from onset through resolution, as applicable  
- Cause (including suspected product/procedure and/or  other cause)  
- Outcome of the event, including resolution and sequelae, as applicable  
 
10.1.4 Additional procedures for Assessing & Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
 PROTOCOL_G6PD validation in  anti-coagulated blood _v.2.0_201912 [ADDRESS_991898] also be assessed by [CONTACT_726345]. An adverse event will be considered unexpected or unanticipated if the nature, 
severity or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described in the protocol,  
Informed Consent, or Investigator’s Brochure (if applicable).  
Any adverse event meeting the criteria for ‘Serious’, regardless of the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_117820], must be reported to PATH  within [ADDRESS_991899] report 
the event by [CONTACT_117854] .  
 
10.1.5 Reporting Obligations to IRB/EC and Health Authorities  
The Investigator must report any adverse events which are serious, unanticipated/unexpected and probably or 
possibly related to the study product or procedures to the reviewing IRB/E thics Committee (EC) .  This report must be 
submitted as soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_991900] le arns of the event.   
PATH  will provide results of any evaluation of an unanticipated/unexpected adverse device effect to appropriate 
IRB/ECs within [ADDRESS_991901] operating procedure  (SOP s). 
PATH will designate trained and qualified personnel to monitor the progress of this clin ical study. Prior to study start, 
a study initiation visit will be conducted to provide training to site staff with regard to the protocol, the completion of 
study documentation and data collection forms, the monitoring schedule, and all regulatory require ments. During the 
study, routine monitoring visits will be conducted to assure the site continues to adhere to the protocol, the 
investigator agreement, and regulations regarding conduct of clinical studies. Assessments will be made regarding 
the participa nts’ protection and safety, when relevant, as well as the quality, completeness, and integrity of the data.

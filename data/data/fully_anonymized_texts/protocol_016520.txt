 1. SYNOPSIS 
Study Title A Randomized, Phase 2, Open-Labe l, Multicenter Study to Evaluat e the 
Safety, Tolerability, and Activity of KD025 in Subjects with Id iopathic 
Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)  
Clinical Phase 2 
Number of Study 
Centers/Sites Approximately 10-15 
Study Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive, irreve rsible, and 
often fatal lung disease of unknow n cause. With a prevalence of  2 to 
29 per 100,000 people and an inc idence of approximately 10 per 
100,000/per year, IPF meets the criteria for classification as an orphan 
disease. It affects older adults with peak prevalence around [ADDRESS_409758] an 
accelerated decline often associat ed with epi[INVESTIGATOR_331326]. The median survival time is 2 to 4 years from diagno sis and 
the 5-year survival rate ranges between 30% and 50%. Its mortal ity rate 
is higher than that of most cancers.  
The commonly accepted method of determining disease progression  is to 
identify a decline in forced vital capacity (FVC). Functionally  stable 
patients show a FVC decline of a  maximum of 5% of the baseline value 
over 6 to 12 months. A decline in FVC of 5% to 10% indicates 
prognostically relevant progressi on, while a decline of ≥ 10% i n 
[ADDRESS_409759] of clinical progres sion. 
These are defined by a subacute or acute increase in shortness of breath 
over a period of 30 days and a hi gh-resolution computed tomogra phy 
([HRCT] slice thickness ≤ 2.[ADDRESS_409760] media) showing ne w 
infiltration of the lungs with no identifiable cause. Acute exa cerbation 
frequency is 5% to 15% per year  and acute exacerbations are ass ociated 
with high mortality. After an acu te exacerbation of IPF, approx imately 
50% of patients die within 3 mont hs, and approximately 80% to 9 0% 
within [ADDRESS_409761] had limited efficacy/a ctivity 
and potential serious side eff ects. However, recently both nint edanib and

 clinical trials, and both received Food and Drug Administration  approval 
in October 2014.  
Study Rationale This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerabil ity, and 
activity of 400 mg of KD025 once-daily (QD) compared to best supportive care (BSC) in subjects with IPF.  
Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK) are members of the 
serine/threonine kinase family, oft en studied for their role in  cell 
morphology, motility, and shape through effects on the cytoskel eton. 
Two isoforms of ROCK have been  identified, ROCK1 and ROCK2. 
Early work with nonspecific ROCK inhibitors (eg, fasudil) sugge sted that 
both ROCK1 and ROCK2 are involve d in Rho-mediated changes in th e 
actin/myosin cytoskele tal network. However more recent research  has 
uncovered additional relevant rol es for ROCK signaling, particu larly 
ROCK2, in conditions including  IPF. Matrix stiffening and 
myofibroblast resistance to apopt osis are cardinal features of chronic 
fibrosis. The ROCK pathway, which is necessary for contraction and 
force generation in fibroblasts a nd for downstream actin polyme rization, 
may therefore be a molecular dr iver for the formation and progr ession of 
pulmonary fibrosis 
The possibility that pulmonary f ibrosis could be directly treat ed by 
[CONTACT_331372]. In a 
bleomycin-induced model of lung fibrosis, intratracheal (IT) 
administration of bleomycin in mice induces changes similar to those of 
diffuse pulmonary fibrosis or f ibrosing alveolitis in humans, m aking this 
a good model of pulmonary fibrosis for testing of new IPF thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In 
particular, bleomycin causes increased deposition and net synth esis of 
collagen in the lungs. A study cond ucted in bleomycin-treated m ice, 
showed that fasudil reduced pulm onary fibrosis even when admini stered 
[ADDRESS_409762] acquisition of co ntractile 
activity, and megakaryoblastic l eukemia (translocation) 1 (MKL1) 
nuclear translocation, preventing the differentiation of fibrob lasts into 
matrix/collagen depositing myofibroblasts in vitro.  
Kadmon Corporation has interna lly evaluated the efficacy/activi ty of 
13 days of therapy with KD025 in  a bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
fibrosis model in mice. C57Bl/6 m ice were treated with KD025 or  
vehicle (0.4% carboxymethyl cellulose) beginning 8 days after I T 
KD025

 treatment with 2.25 U/kg of bleom ycin. At the initiation of tre atment, 
pulmonary fibrosis was already established. Unlike vehicle cont rol 
therapy, oral QD treatment with 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg of KD02 5 
significantly reduced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. 
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) have been found to be increased  in the 
lung and bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) fluid of patients with IP F. A 
matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) previously implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF, is significantly increased in plasma, seru m, BAL 
fluid, and lung tissue of IPF patients, suggesting that MMP7 ma y be a 
biomarker for IPF disease progression or mortality. The MMP7 le vels 
will therefore be studied in this clinical trial, in addition t o other potential 
future biomarkers for patient selection and pharmacodynamic res ponse; 
chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) and surfactant protein-D (SPD). 
Dose Rationale This study will evaluate KD025 at  a dose of 400 mg QD.  Prelimi nary 
data from an ongoing study of KD 025 in patients with moderate t o severe 
psoriasis suggests that the do se of 400 mg QD for 12 weeks is a ssociated 
with clinical efficacy/activity a nd is well tolerated. This stu dy will 
examine the safety and clinical  efficacy/activity of the [ADDRESS_409763] a poor clinical prognosis, as p oor as 
some types of aggressive cancer. Thus the risk to benefit ratio  in these 
subjects favors the use of the 400 mg QD dose level which has 
demonstrated tolerability and clinical activity in previous cli nical studies.

Efficacy/Activity 
Evaluation Pulmonary function testing (PFT) will be performed at screening, 
baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, a nd at a 30-day Follow-up visit ( for 
subjects continuing, PFTs will be p erformed every 12 weeks). Pu lmonary 
function testing will include FVC, RV, and DL CO. The same equipment 
and tester should be used during the course of the study to the  extent 
possible.    The person responsib le for conducting the pulmonar y 
function tests will be required to  comply with the study guidel ines and 
the American Thoracic Society/Eu ropean Respi[INVESTIGATOR_331330] t 
criteria on lung function testing. 
The 6MWD  will be assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks and 
24 weeks (for subjects continuing , 6MWD will be performed every  
12 weeks).  The distance traveled during 6 minutes (meters) wil l be 
measured in accordance with publis hed guidelines.  The total di stance 
ambulated in meters during the 6-minute walk test and the numbe r of rest 
stops is recorded.  The 6MWD, weight, heart rate, blood pressur e, and 
pulse oximeter oxygen saturation  (Sp0 2) are recorded before and after the 
walk.

 3. SpO 2 decreases to < 88% (heart fa ilure or pulmonary embolism 
excluded). 
Acute exacerbation can be diagno sed if Items [ADDRESS_409779]. 
Time to progression of IPF  is defined as time from the Week 1, Day 1 
visit to any 1 of the following:  
1. First respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
2. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]-related death. 
3. Absolute decline in FVC percent of predicted value of ≥ 10% 
versus FVC percent of predicted  value recorded at baseline.   
4. Absolute decline in DLCO, adjus ted for hemoglobin, percent of 
predicted value  of ≥ 15% versus DL CO recorded at baseline.  
Pharmacodynamics Serum levels for MMP7, CCL18,  and SPD will be as sessed at baseline,

Statistical Analysis Study Populations 
Three populations will be employed in the analysis of study dat a: 
 The Safety Population will cons ist of all subjects who are 
randomized and receive at least 1 dose of KD025 (Treatment 
Group 1) or have week 1 assessme nt for BSC subjects. All safety  
analyses will be performed on the safety population 
 The Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population will consist of 
all subjects in the safety popula tion who have evaluable baseli ne 
and at least [ADDRESS_409781] baseline FVC assessment. Only 
evaluable FVC will be used in efficacy analyses.

 4. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IP F) is a chronic, progressive, irreversible, and often fatal lung disease 
of unknown cause. With a prevalence of 2 to 29 per 100,000 and an incidence of approximately 
10 per 100,000/year, IPF meets the criteria for classification as an orphan disease.[ADDRESS_409800] an accelerated decline often assoc iated with epi[INVESTIGATOR_331332].2,3,4,5  The median survival time is 2  to 4 years from diagnosis and t he 5-year 
survival rate ranges between 30% and 50%.1,4,6,[ADDRESS_409801] cancers.  
The commonly accepted method of d etermining disease progression  is to identify a decline in forced 
vital capacity (FVC).  Functionall y stable patients show a FVC decline of a maximum of 5% of the 
baseline value over 6 to 12 months.1,7,8  A decline in FVC of 5% to 10%  in any subject indicates 
prognostically relevant progress ion, while a decline of ≥ 10% i n [ADDRESS_409802] of clinical progres sion. These are defined by a subacute 
or acute increase in shortness of breath over a period of 30 da ys and a high-resolution computed 
tomography ([HRCT] slice thickness  ≤ 2.[ADDRESS_409803] media)  showing new infiltration of the 
lungs with no identifiable cau se. Acute exacerbation frequency is 5% to 15% per year and acute 
exacerbations are associated with high mortality. After an acut e exacerbation of IPF, approximately 
50% of patients die within 3 mont hs, and approximately 80% to 9 0% within [ADDRESS_409804] had limited efficacy/activity and potential seri ous side effects.  However, recently both 
nintedanib and pi[INVESTIGATOR_331333] F VC in separate Phase 3 clinical 
trials9,10 and both received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in October 2014.  
4.1. Study Rationale 
This study is being conducted to  evaluate the safety, tolerabil ity, and activity of 400 mg of KD025 
orally administered once-daily ( QD) compared to best supportive  care (BSC) in subjects with IPF. 
Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK) are members of the serine /threonine kinase family, often 
studied for their role in cel l morphology, motility, and shape through effects on the cytoskeleton.11,[ADDRESS_409805] been i dentified, ROCK1 and ROCK2. Ear ly work with nonspecific 
KD025 
IND Number 128024 Protocol Number KD025-207
Amendment No. 9

 ROCK inhibitors (eg, fasudil) sugg ested that both ROCK1 and ROC K2 are involved in 
Rho-mediated changes in  the actin/myosin cytoskeletal network.  However, more recent research has 
uncovered additional relevant rol es for ROCK signaling, particu larly ROCK2, in conditions 
including IPF.  Matrix stiffening and myofibroblast resistance to apoptosis are cardinal features of 
chronic fibrosis. The ROCK path way, which is necessary for cont raction and force generation in 
fibroblasts and for downstream actin polymerization, may theref ore be a molecular driver for in the 
formation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis. 
The possibility that pulmonary f ibrosis could be directly treat ed by [CONTACT_331380]. I n a bleomycin-induced model of l ung fibrosis, intratracheal (IT) 
administration of bleomycin in mice induces changes similar to those of diffuse pulmonary fibrosis 
or fibrosing alveolitis in human s, making this a good model of pulmonary fibrosis for testing of new 
IPF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In particular, bleomycin causes increased deposi tion and net synthesis of collagen in 
the lungs. A study conducted in bleomycin-treated mice, showed that fasudil reduced pulmonary 
fibrosis even when administered [ADDRESS_409806] acqui sition of contractile activity,  and megakaryoblastic leukemia 
(translocation) 1 MKL1 nuclear t ranslocation, preventing the di fferentiation of fibroblasts into 
matrix/collagen depositing myofibroblasts in vitro.  
Kadmon Corporation has internally  evaluated the efficacy/activi ty of 13 days of therapy with KD025 
in a bleomycin-induced pulmonary  fibrosis model in mice. C57Bl/ 6 mice were treated with KD025 
or vehicle (0.4% carboxymethyl cel lulose) beginning 8 days afte r IT treatment with 2.25 U/kg of 
bleomycin.  At the initiation of  treatment, pulmonary fibrosis was already established. Unlike vehicle 
control therapy, oral QD treatment with 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg  of KD025 significantly reduced 
pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation.  
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) have been found to be increased  in the lung and bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with IPF.  A matrix metalloprote inase-7 (MMP7) previously 
implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF,14,15 is significantly increased in  plasma, serum, BAL fluid, and 
lung tissue of IPF patients, sugge sting that MMP7 may be a biom arker for IPF disease progression or 
mortality.  The MMP7 levels will therefore be studied in this c linical trial, in addition to  other

4.2. Summary of Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human 
Subjects 
All the possible side effects r elated to KD025 are not known.  The KD025 Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB) contains data on risks asso ciated with KD025.  Other risks  to subjects involve side effects from 
study procedures.  There  are also other risks associated with t aking part in this study, such as the 
risks associated with a loss of privacy or confidentiality beca use of improper disclosure.   
There may be no direct benefit to  subjects enrolled into this s tudy.  Subjects may receive a clinical 
benefit from KD025, and some subj ects may progress.  The inform ation from this study may help 
other subjects with IPF and mor e may be learned about the study  drug as a possible new treatment for 
IPF.   
4.3. Selection of Doses  in this Study  
This study will evaluate KD025 at  a dose of 400 mg QD.  Prelimi nary data from an ongoing study of 
KD025 in patients with moderate t o severe psoriasis suggests th at the dose of 400 mg QD for 
12 weeks is associated with clinical efficacy/activity and is w ell-tolerated.  This study will examine 
the safety and clinical efficac y/activity of the [ADDRESS_409807] been 5 Pha se 1 trials conducted with KD025 in normal healthy subjects: a 
single-ascending dose (SAD) tr ial (Study 2119-09-01), a combine d single- and multiple-ascending 
dose (SAD/MAD) trial (Study KD025 -101), a MAD trial with QD and  BID dosing

 (Study KD025-102), a placebo-contro lled safety and pharmacokine tic (PK) study 
(Study KD025-103), and a food effe ct study (Study KD025-105).  A Phase 2a, open-label study in 
[ADDRESS_409808]-line therapy was 
recently completed (Study KD025- 205).  Additionally, a Phase [ADDRESS_409809] disease prog ression after 1 systemic therapy is 
currently on-going (Study KD025-206).  
The SAD trial (Study SLx-2119-09- 01) assessed the safety, toler ability, and PK of KD025.  The dose 
levels of KD025 that were tested included 20, 40, 80, and 160 m g.  Thirty-two subjects were 
randomized in 4 cohorts of 8 subj ects with 6 receiving drug and  2 receiving placebo.  No treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to withdrawal, deaths, or serious adverse events (SAEs) 
were reported in this trial.  T here were [ADDRESS_409810] 
had laboratory abnormalities duri ng the dosing period or within  1 week after dosing.  There were no 
changes in blood pressure or he art rate and no clinically signi ficant QTcB or corrected QT interval 
using Fridericia’s formula (QTc[F]) parameters.  
KD025 was readily absorbed and wa s measured out to 24 hours in plasma.  KD025 was the main 
analyte (> 90% parent derived area under the curve  [AUC]) and KD025m2 was present at about 5%, 
with KD025m1 < 1%.  The half-life (t 1/2) of KD025 was approximately 5–6 hours, supporting

A MAD trial (Study KD025-102) was  a single-center, placebo-cont rolled, double-blind, randomized 
(6:2) study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of KD025  administered for 7 days in up to 
32 healthy male and postmenopaus al female subjects.  This study  enrolled 4 cohorts with 8 subjects 
in each cohort (6 subjects rece ived KD025 and 2 subjects receiv ed placebo).  The dose regimens 
studied were 500, 800, and [ADDRESS_409812] 1 dose of study drug, and 31 subj ects completed the study; all 
[ADDRESS_409813].  
Multiple escalating doses of KD025 ranging from 500 mg to 800 m g to 1000 mg QD and 500 mg 
BID for 7 days were generally well tolerated and no dose-limiti ng toxicities were reported in this 
study.  Five TEAEs were reported in 4 subjects (16.7%) receivin g KD025, including upper 
abdominal pain and diarrhea in [ADDRESS_409814] (12.5%) re ceiving placebo.  There were no  TEAEs in subjects receiving KD025 
800 mg QD.  No subjects discontinue d study participation becaus e of AEs.  There were no clinically 
relevant changes and no clinical ly meaningful trends in hematol ogy, chemistry, a nd urinalysis 
laboratory results attributable to study drug during this study .  There were no SAEs or deaths. 
The following are PK conc lusions from this study: 
 KD025 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_331334] (T max) values ranging from 1.[ADDRESS_409815]-dose. 
 Median T max values after BID dosi ng were more variable and ranged from 4.[ADDRESS_409816] dose to 12.0 hours after the second dose. 
 Mean half-life (t 1/2) values were similar across dos e levels for each day, with val ues ranging 
from 4.55 to 5.76 hours for Day 1 and from 7.68 to 9.73 hours f or Day 7. 
 Mean KD025 maximum concentration observed (C max) and AUC 0-24hr values generally 
increased in a less than dose proportional manner  with the incr ease in QD dose level from 
500 to 1000 mg.

 body systems. A complete PE is to  include documentation of heig ht (screening onl y), weight, body 
temperature, and vital signs ( blood pressure [sitting], pulse r ate [sitting], and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) and 
will be performed by a physicia n or staff member who is qualifi ed to perform such examinations (eg, 
physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner).     
Any abnormal or clinically signi ficant findings from the PE mus t be recorded on the appropriate 
electronic case repor t form (eCRF) page.   
Vital Sign Measurements Vital sign measurements will be c ollected after the subject has  been sitting for 5 minutes.  Vital sign 
assessments will include measure ments of sitting blood pressure  (mm Hg), heart rate (beats per 
minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (breath s per minute), and temperature  (Celsius). 
Please note that blood pressure m easurements are to be performe d using appropriate technique (per 
guidelines of the American Heart Association).  Specifically, s ubjects should be sea ted quietly for at 
least 5 minutes in a chair with their backs supported, their fe et flat on floor (legs uncrossed), and their 
arms bared on a hard surface, w ith the arm slightly abducted an d bent, with palm up and the midpoint 
of upper arm at heart level.  Co rrect cuff and bladder size sho uld be utilized.  Two or more readings 
separated by [ADDRESS_409843]’s

 8.10. Electrocardiogram Assessments 
Digital 12-lead ECGs will be obtained during the study (see Tab le 1 for timing of ECG assessments).  
Note that at the Week [ADDRESS_409854]-dose (T max) for subjects in Treatment Group 1. 
Digital 12-lead ECG recordings a re to be made with the subject in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_331345] 5 mi nutes before each reading.  The ECG is to be  repeated 3 times 
consecutively within 30 minutes (m ust have an interval of at le ast 1–2 minutes between ECGs).  At 
each visit, the ECG is to be perfo rmed immediately before any b lood sample collection. 
The following ECG parameters wil l be collected:  PR interval, Q RS interval, and QTc or QTc(F); 
Fridericia’s correction (see Appendix D  for formula).  The ECG fi ndings will be evaluated by a 
qualified physician for the pre sence of abnormalities (qualitat ive assessment).  The physician will 
assess each ECG as normal, abnor mal/not clinically significant,  or abnormal/clini cally significant.   
Abnormalities in the ECG that lead  to a change in subject manag ement (eg, dose reduction or delay, 
requirement for additional medic ation or monitoring) or result in clinical signs a nd symptoms are 
considered clinically significan t for the purposes of this stud y and will be recorded in the AE eCRF.  
If ECG abnormalities meet crite ria defining them as serious, th ey must be reported as an SAE (see 
Section 13.1 ). 
8.11. Pulmonary Function Tests (i ncluding FVC, RV, and DLCO) 
Pulmonary function testing will b e performed during the study ( see Table 1  for timing of 
assessments). Pulmonary function testing will include FVC, RV, and DL CO. The same equipment and 
tester should be used during the course of the study. For each subject, PFT shoul d be done at 
approximately the same time of the day. The test will be conduc ted while the subject is in a seated 
position and will be done in triplicate.  
8.12. 6-Minute Walking Distance 
The 6MWD will be measured duri ng the study (see Table 1 for tim ing of assessment).  The distance 
travelled during 6 minutes (meter s) will be measured in accorda nce with published guidelines.  The 
total distance ambulated in meters  during the 6MWD test and the  number of rest stops is recorded. 
The 6MWD, weight, heart rate, blo od pressure, and Sp02 will be recorded before and after the walk.

7. Prone scans if dependent density obscures detail on supi[INVESTIGATOR_331348] 
8. Optional coronal and sagittal re constructions if volumetric ima ges are obtained 
8.14. Occurrence of Acute Exacerbation  
Occurrence of acute exacerbation (frequency and severity) of IP F will be assessed throughout 
treatment (see Table 1  for timing of assessment).  The  following clinical deteriorati on symptoms 
within a month that cannot be e xplained by [CONTACT_331382] b e assessed as acute exacerbation. 
1. Aggravated dyspnea; 
2. Newly discovered chest  interstitial lung abnormality by [CONTACT_331383]/HRCT, without 
pneumothorax or pleural effusion; 
3. SpO 2 decreases to < 88% (heart failu re or pulmonary embolism exclud ed). 
Acute exacerbation can be diagnosed if items 1 and 2 are presen t or if items 1 and 3 are present. Per 
the 2011 IPF Diagnosis Manag ement and Guidelines,1 criteria for acute ex acerbations should include 
an absence of an alternative exp lanation such as infection, pul monary embolism, pneumothorax, or 
heart failure.

 10. PHARMACODYNAMICS  
The MMP7, CCL18, and SPD serum lev els will be assessed during t he study (see Table 1  for 
sampling times).  Serum MMP7 conc entrations in peripheral blood  are easily measurable and reflect 
changes in the alveolar microenvironment.  Thus, mean serum MMP [ADDRESS_409856] in the  study; however, in the event that a 
subject is withdrawn from the st udy, every effort will be made by [CONTACT_331384].  T his evaluation should include final 
observations, as required by [CONTACT_331385]’s withdrawal.  T he reason(s) for 
termination must be clearly doc umented on the appropriate eCRF.   A termination eCRF page must be 
completed for any subject w ho is enrolled in the study.  
11.1. Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdr aw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice 
to their future medical care by [CONTACT_331386].  
Subjects can decline to continue r eceiving study drug and/or ot her protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_331349].  If this occurs, the I nvestigator is to discuss with the subject 
the appropriate processes for discontinuation from study drug o r other protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_331350] 
(Table 1 ) and collection of data, including endpoints and AEs.   
Withdrawal of consent for a stu dy means that the subject does n ot wish to receive further 
protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34405] p rocedures, and the subject does  not wish to or is unable to continue 
further study participation.  Subj ect data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis 
of the study, and where permitte d, publically available data ca n be included after withdrawal of 
consent.  The Investigator is to d iscuss with the subject appro priate procedures for  withdrawal from 
the study.   
11.1.1  Treatment Discontinuation   
Treatment discontinuation reaso ns include any of the following:  
 An AE requires permanent discontinuation of study drug or BSC 
 Investigator decision 
 Voluntary withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] 
 Noncompliance to protocol 
 Subject lost to follow-up 
 Termination of the study by [CONTACT_3211]

 Completion of Follow-up Period 
 Voluntary withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] 
 Subject lost to follow-up 
 Termination of the study by [CONTACT_3211] 
 Subject death 
In the event of premature disc ontinuation, every effort should be made to have the subject come to 
the clinic for an End of Treatme nt visit in order for the Inves tigator to perform study follow-up 
procedures.  Refer to Table [ADDRESS_409857] of procedures to be per formed at 
the End of Treatment visit.    
Subjects who are withdrawn from this study because of toxicity are to be followed until there is 
either: 
 Resolution or stabilization of toxicity 
 The subject is lost to follow-up 
 The event is otherwise explained 
If there is an ongoing toxicity because of KD025, subjects must  be followed with appropriate medical

Subjects will be dispensed study drug to self-administer while on an outpatient basi s.  Subjects will 
return to the clinic as outlin ed in the Study Assessments table  (Table 1 ), and will receive that day’s 
dose of study drug while at the clinic. 
The amount of study drug dispensed to the subject at the beginn ing of each dosing month should be 
sufficient to allow for 1 month of dosing with KD025. 
The Investigator (or designee)  will be responsible for recordin g this information on the appropriate 
study drug inventory.  This inventory will be maintained throug hout the duration of  the trial and will 
be periodically reviewed by a representative of the sponsor. 
The Investigator (or designee) w ill instruct the subject that a ll dispensed bottles must be returned at 
each follow-up visit, at which time a capsule or tablet count w ill be conducted to assure subject 
dosing compliance. 
Additionally, subjects will be r equired to keep study drug diar ies in which they will record the 
amount, date and time of study drug administrations.  These dia ries will be dispensed and/or 
reviewed/collected at each visit. 
12.8. Study Drug Storage 
All supplies of study drug are t o be stored at USP controlled r oom temperature of 25°C (77°F) with

SAFETY Safety Parameters 
The Clinical Symptom and Adverse Event Grading Scale will be us ed for grading toxicities (see 
Appendix B).  Laboratory results will be classified using the T oxicity Grading Scale for Healthy 
Adult and Adolescent Volunteers E nrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (see Appendix A ).  
Subjects will be monitored thr oughout the treatment and follow- up period for occurrence of AEs 
(acute, delayed, and/or cumulativ e), as well as for changes in clinical status, vital sign measurements, 
and laboratory data.  Safety para meters to be mea sured/assessed  include vital sign measurements, PE 
findings, hematology, serum chemi stries, coagulation, and urina lysis results, and ECG recordings. 
Adverse Event Definition 
KD025 
IND Number [ADDRESS_409876] associated with the 
use of a drug, whether or not c onsidered drug related.  An AE c an be an unfavorable and unintended 
sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory value finding), a symptom, or a disease temporally associated with 
the use of a drug, without judgment as to causality.  An AE can  arise from use of the drug (eg, use in 
combination with another drug) a nd from any route of administra tion, formulation or dose, including 
an overdose.  An AE also includes, but is not limited to, any c linically significant worsening of a 
pre-existing condition.  Examples include: 
 Any sign, symptom, phy sical finding, or laboratory result that has worsened in nature, 
severity or frequency compared to baseline; 
 Reactions from an investigationa l drug, including those occurri ng as a result of an 
overdose, abuse of the study drug , withdrawal phenomena, sensit ivity or toxicity; 
 Concurrent illness that was not p resent or worsens in nature, s everity, or frequency 
compared to baseline;  
 Injury or accident; and/or 
 Exacerbation of a pre-existing condition 
For the purpose of data collectio n, all untoward events that oc cur after informed consent through 
[ADDRESS_409877] dose of KD025 are to be recorded on eCRFs by  [CONTACT_118448] l site.   For BSC 
subjects, AEs will be recorded t hrough the End-of-Week 24 visit . 
Evaluating Adverse Events 
The Investigator will determin e the seriousness, intensity, and  causality of an AE associated with the 
use of the study drug (i e, events where there is a reasonable p ossibility that the event may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_5257]) based on the definitions that follow.  
Serious Adverse Events (Notify sponsor or designee wi thin 24 hours; document on eCRF) 
The SAE definition and reporting requirements are in accordance  with Title 21 Part  Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and the Guidance for Industry and Inve stigators Safety Reporting 
Requirements for Investigationa l New Drug (INDs) and Bioavailab ility /Bioequivalence Studies. 
SAE:  An AE is considered "seriou s" if, in the view of either t he Investigator or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes: 
Death:   This includes any death that occurs while the subject is “on study” as well as any death that 
occurs within 30 days after  study drug administration.

 Note : Death is an outcome of an AE , and not an AE in itself.  The e vent(s) that caused death (eg, 
illness, accident) is the SAE.  D eath due to any other cause(s)  must also be reported as an outcome of 
the reportable SAE. 
Life-threatening adverse event:   An AE or suspected advers e reaction is considered 
“life-threatening” if, in the vi ew of either the Investigator o r sponsor, its occurrence places the patient 
or subject at immediate risk of d eath. It does not include an A E or suspected adve rse reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe  form, might have caused death.   
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_331325]: 
In the absence of an AE, the Investigator should not report hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_135627].  This is the cas e in the following situations:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_331354] r a procedure required by

Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical event:   An event that may not result in death, be life threatening, o r require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171763], based upon appr opriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the subject and may re quire medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.   
Suspected Unexpected Serious  Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
(Notify sponsor or designee with in [ADDRESS_409878] awareness) 
A suspected unexpected serious a dverse reaction is any adverse drug event, the specificity or severity 
of which is not consistent with those noted in the current prot ocol and/or IB.  This refers to any AE 
that has not been previously obs erved (eg, included in the Inve stigator Brochure), rather than from 
the perspective of such an event  not being anticipated from the  pharmacological properties of the 
product.

 Unexpected Adverse Events  
(Notify sponsor or designee by [CONTACT_241565]) 
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed;  or, if an IB is not required o r available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the Gen eral Investigational Plan or el sewhere in the current application. 
Also refers to AEs that are ment ioned in the IB as occurring wi th a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological propertie s of the drug, but are not sp ecifically mentioned as occurring with 
the particular drug under investigation. 
Non-Serious Adverse Events  
All other AEs, not fulfilling th e previous definitions, are cla ssified as nonserious. 
Protocol-Related Adverse Events 
AEs that are not study drug relate d may nevertheless be conside red by [CONTACT_331391] c onduct of the clinical study.  Th at is, the event may b e related to the fact 
that a subject is participating in the study.  For example, a p rotocol-related AE may be an event that 
occurs during a washout period or  that is related to a procedur e required by [CONTACT_760]. 
Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator will attempt to  assess the relationship of the  event to study drug using a 5-point 
scale (not related, unlikely-rela ted, possibly related, probabl y related, or definitely related; see 
Appendix C). 
Recording Adverse Events 
All AEs (including SAEs) are to be accurately recorded on the A dverse Event page of the subject’s 
eCRF during the subjec t’s participation in the study.  The seve rity of each AE will be graded using a 
5-point scale (mild, moderate, sever e, life threatening, or dea th; see Appendix B).  The date of onset 
as well as the end date of the e vent also should be recorded or  the event should be entered as 
“ongoing”.  In addition, the method used to treat the AE and th e outcome of the AE also will be 
noted.  The Investigator will asse ss the relationship of the ev ent to study drug.  Note:  All SAEs also 
are to be entered onto an SAE form and sent to sponsor or desig nee.

 and symptoms may then be describ ed in the event description.  F or example, dyspnea 
should not be used as an SAE term if the diagnosis which caused  the dyspnea is known to 
be malignant pleural effusion.   
 Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE, unless the 
event preceding the death is unknown.  In the exceptional case where the events leading to 
death are unknown, then death ma y be used as an event term.  If  an autopsy was

All statistical analyses wi ll be performed using SAS® (SAS Institute, Cary, Nor th Carolina) statistical 
software Version 9.[ADDRESS_409885] 
observed measurement prior to t he initial dose of KD025 will be  considered the baseline 
measurement.   
Continuous data will be described  using descriptive statistics:  number of observations (n), mean, 
standard deviation, median, min imum and maximum.  Frequencies a nd percentages will be used for 
summarizing discrete (categori cal) data.  When categorical data  are presented, the percent will be 
suppressed when the co unt is zero in order to draw attention to  the nonzero counts.  The denominator 
for all percentages, unless otherwise specified, will be the nu mber of subjects in the specified 
analysis population.   
Hypothesis testing, if appropria te, will be carried out at the 5% (2-sided) significance level.  Because 
of the exploratory nature of the  study, no adjustments will be made for the multiplicity of endpoints.  
Nonparametric tests may be used i n preference to parametric tes ts if parametric assumptions are 
notably violated.  Missing values will not be imputed.  If a su bject does not have sufficient data for a 
particular analysis, they will b e excluded from that analysis.  Endpoints defined as an average of 
multiple measurements will be use d those data points that are n on-missing, and the denominator was 
adjusted accordingly. 
14.2. Sample Size Justification  
With 54 subjects in the KD025 Treatment Group and 27 in the BSC  Treatment Group, the study has 
over 90% power at the two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_409886] a 20% difference between 
treatment groups at [ADDRESS_409887] deviation 
in percent change from baseline in FVC of 17%. 
The sample size of 54 subjects receiving KD025 will provide ove r 90% probability of 1 or more 
subjects in the study experienci ng an AE that has an underlying  rate of ≥ 5%.

 14.3. Statistical Considerations  
The statistical methodology will b e further described in a Stat istical Analysis Plan which will be 
finalized prior to database lock. 
14.3.1  Study Populations  
Three populations will be employed in the analysis of study dat a: 
 The Safety Population will cons ist of all subjects who are rand omized and receive at least 
1 dose of KD025 (Treatment Group  1) or have Week 1 assessment f or BSC subjects. All 
safety analyses will be performed on the safety population 
 The Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population will consist of all subjects in the Safety 
Population who have evaluable bas eline and at least one evaluab le post baseline FVC 
assessment. Only evaluable FVC will be used in efficacy. 
 The Per Protocol (PP) Populati on will consist of all subjects i n the safety population who 
have evaluable baseline and evaluable Week 24 FVC assessment. F or any analysis on the PP 
Population, for subjects assigned to treatment and actually rec eived treatment, re-calculated 
baseline value should be use d for cross over patients. 
The primary and secondary efficac y/activity endpoints will be a nalyzed using both the mITT and PP 
Populations.  
14.3.[ADDRESS_409888] dispositi on, and screening and baseline c haracteristics will be summarized for 
the mITT Population, where appropriate.    
14.3.3  KD025 Exposure  
For the KD025 Treatment Group, t he amount of KD025 administered  by [CONTACT_331397] t in data listings.  In additi on, delays and all other alterations in 
KD025 administration will be presented.  
14.3.4  Concomitant Medicati ons and Procedures 
Concomitant medications will be coded using WHO Drug Dictionary  and the data will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_331398]. Concomitant procedures 
performed during the study will also be collected and presented  in listings.

 14.4. Activity/Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy/activity e ndpoint is the change in FVC fro m baseline to 24 weeks. A mixed 
model (if numeric stable) or anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) mo del will be used for the between 
treatment groups comparison of t he Week [ADDRESS_409889] experiencing one or mo re AEs during the treatment period.  
The percentage of subjects experi encing an AE will be summarize d for the KD025 and BSC 
treatment groups (descriptive st atistics only). Primary safety analyses will be performed on the safety 
population.    
Secondary Endpoints  
 The change in 6MWD from baseline to 24 weeks  
 Acute exacerbation of IPF thr oughout the treatment period  
 The change in occurrence, frequ ency and severity of lung fibros is as measured by 
[CONTACT_331399] a nd after 24 weeks of treatment  
 To evaluate the percentage of subjects with disease progression  before or at [ADDRESS_409890] and the 
corresponding baseline value as a covariate.   
The percentage of subjects in e ach treatment group who experien ce acute exacerbation of IPF 
throughout the treatment period wi ll be compared by a Fisher’s Exact test.  
Exploratory Endpoints 
 The change in MMP7, CCL18 and SPD  serum levels from baseline to  [ADDRESS_409891] and the correspond ing baseline value as a covariate. 
14.5. Safety Data  
Safety assessments include AEs, S AEs, PEs, vital s ign measureme nts, clinical laboratory evaluations, 
ECGs, and reasons for t reatment discontinuation due to toxicity .  
AEs will be coded using the MedD RA dictionary (Version 20.0 or greater.)  The number and 
percentages of subject s experiencing treatment-emergent AEs wil l be tabulated by [CONTACT_331400].  The number of e vents by [CONTACT_331401]025 
IND Number [ADDRESS_409892]  listing will be provided for SAEs, AEs resulting in study 
discontinuation and de aths.  All AEs (including SAEs will be gr aded using a 5-point scale (mild, 
moderate, severe, life threaten ing, or death; see Appendix B).  
AEs, SAEs, related AEs, related SAEs, ≥ Grade 3 AEs, related ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_409893] dose of study drug will be summarized (or 
after Week 1, Day 1 visit for BSC cohort). The incidence of ≥ G rade [ADDRESS_409894] the Investigator’s record s by [CONTACT_11200] (source  document verification) and by [CONTACT_331402] a drug–dispensing log by [CONTACT_737].  Coll ected data will be entered into a

E6 Tripartite Guideline (Janua ry 1997), and in general, be cond ucted in a manner consistent with the 
most recent version of the Decla ration of Helsinki.  The Invest igator will ensure that the conduct of 
the study complies with the basic  principles of GCP as outlined  in the current version of 21 CFR, 
subpart D, Part 312, “Responsibiliti es of Sponsors and Investig ators”, Part 50, “Protection of Human 
Subjects”, and Part 56, “Instituti onal Review Boards” or applic able local equivalent. 
16.2. Informed Consent 
Sample ICFs will be supplied to each site.  Kadmon Corporation or its designee must review any ICF 
prior to submission for review by [CONTACT_1201].  The final IRB-appro ved document must be provided to 
Kadmon Corporation for regulatory purposes. 
It is the responsibility of the  Investigator, or a person desig nated by [CONTACT_18613], to obtain written 
informed consent from each subject  (or the subject’s legally au thorized representative) participating 
in this study after adequate e xplanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benef its, and potential 
hazards of the study in accordanc e with federal and state regul ations.  In the case where the subject is 
unable to read, an impartial witn ess should be present during t he entire informed consent discussion.  
After the subject has orally consented to participation in the trial, the witness’ si gnature on the form 
will attest that the information in the consent form was accura tely explained and understood.  A copy 
of the ICF must be provided to t he subject or to the subject’s legally authorized representative.  If 
applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of t he local language. 
The eCRF for this study contains  a section for documenting info rmed subject consent, and this must 
be completed appropria tely.  Signed ICFs mus t remain in each su bject’s study file and must be 
available for verification by [CONTACT_9534].  If n ew safety information results in changes 
in the risk/benefit assessment,  the consent form should be revi ewed and updated as necessary.  All 
subjects (including those alread y being treated) should be info rmed of the new information, should be 
given a copy of the revised for m, and should give their consent  to continue in the study. 
16.3. Institutional Review Board 
This study is being conducted unde r a [LOCATION_002] IND applica tion.  This protocol (and any 
modifications) and appropriate c onsent procedures must be revie wed and approved by [CONTACT_2717].  This

16.4. Future Use of Subject Samples 
Not all of the tissue and blood components obtained during this  study may be required for the tests 
that are part of the clinical t rial.  Following the conclusion of the study, the samples may be used for 
additional research.  This resear ch will help to understand dis ease subtypes, drug response and 
toxicity, and possibly identify new drug targets or biomarkers that predict subject response to 
treatment.  The use o f the samples for in ternal research will b e done according to the guidelines 
defined by [CONTACT_331403] (issued 25 April  25 2006) and the European Medicines 
Agency Reflection Paper on Phar macogenetic Sampl es, Testing and  Data Handling 
(EMEA/CHMP/PGxWP/201914/2006).  If a subject requests destructi on of their tissue and blood 
samples and the samples have not  yet been de-identified, Kadmon  Corporation will destroy the 
samples as described in this FDA  guidance.  Kadmon Corporation will notify the Investigator in 
writing that the samples have b een destroyed. Samples will be h eld no longer than [ADDRESS_409896] to 
study subjects, or when the change  involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial 
(eg, change in monitor, change of telephone number).

 APPENDIX C: CLINICAL ADV ERSE EVENTS: DETERMINING 
RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY DRUG 
 
1 NOT RELATED 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical  consideration, are c learly felt to be 
due to extraneous causes (eg, disease, environment, etc.) that are unrelated to the  administration of 
study drug. 
 
2 UNLIKELY RELATED  (must have first 2) 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical  consideration, are f elt unlikely to be 
related to the adminis tration of the study  drug.  The relations hip of an AE to the study drug can be 
considered unlikely if: 
 
 It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administ ration of the drug. 
 It could readily have been a re sult of the subject’s clinical s tate, environmental or toxic factors, or 
other modes of therapy adm inistered to the subject. 
 It does not follow a known response pattern to the suspected dr ug. 
 It does not reappear or worsen w hen the drug is re-administered . 
 
3 POSSIBLY RELATED  (must have first 2) 
 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical  consideration, are f elt unlikely to be 
related to the administration of the study drug, but the possib ility cannot be ruled o ut with certainty.  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug can be considered p ossible if: 
 
 It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration o f the drug. 
 It could readily have been a re sult of the subject’s clinical s tate, environmental or toxic factors, or 
other modes of therapy adm inistered to the subject. 
 It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
 
4 PROBABLY RELATED  (must have first 3) 
 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical  consideration, are felt with a high degree 
of certainty to be related to th e administration of the study d rug.  The relationship of an AE to the study 
drug can be considered probable if: 
 
 It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration o f the drug.  
 It could not be reasonably expla ined by [CONTACT_331408]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy admini stered to the subject. 
 It disappears or decreases upon cessation of drug or reduction in dose.* 
 It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
 
5 DEFINITELY RELATED  (must have first 3) 
 
This category applies to those AEs, which, after careful medica l consideration, are f elt to be related to 
the administration of the study drug.  The relationship of an A E to the study drug can be considered 
related if: 
 It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration o f the drug or drug levels have been 
established in body fluids or tissues. 
 It could not be reasonably expla ined by [CONTACT_331408]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy admini stered to the subject.

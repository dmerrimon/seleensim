Protocol Version:  04/09/[ADDRESS_261287] common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries.  Although current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_45732] a five -year survival of 80- 90% for low risk 
patients with Stage I disease, patients with high -risk (serous or clear cell – any stage or Stage III 
grade 2 or 3 endometrioid histology) disease have poor survival ranging from 18- 74% with 
Stage I -IV disease. For those who recur, multi -modality treatment options are not successful.  
Thus, there is a pressing need for development of novel therapeutics for high- risk endometrial 
cancer (1).  
 Standard of care treatment for locally advanced disease includes surgical resection followed by [CONTACT_217774], and for advanced, metastatic dise ase, the standard of care includes surgical 
resection followed by [CONTACT_217775]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_217762], a portion of locally advanced and metastatic disease patients will suffer disease 
specific mortalit y and could benefit from novel therapeutic approaches.  
 
Endometrial cancer has distinct features that make it ideal for checkpoint blockade based 
immunotherapeutic approaches.  First, there has been positive PD -L1 immunohistochemical 
expression detected i n 83% of primary, 67% of recurrent, and 100% of metastatic endometrial 
cancers (2). As seen in the MK -[ADDRESS_261288] 48 genes with 
differential mutation frequencies that can lead to an array of antigenic targets for immune based 
therapeutics (3). Such high mutational frequencies in tumors have been hypothesized to be a 
factor in patient response to checkpoint inhibitors, as in the case of lung and bladder cancers. 
Thus, we believe that anti -PD1 therapy will have signal in endometrial carcinoma.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_261289] immune surveillance in controlling outgrow th of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades ( 4).  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between t umor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies ( 5-9) .  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ 
effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulato ry T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and 
long-term survival in many solid tumors.  
 
The PD -[ADDRESS_261290] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -
cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, 
including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily 
member related to CD28 and CTLA -4, which has been show n to negatively regulate antigen 
receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) (10, 11) .  The 
structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved ( 12).  PD -1 and family members are type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for 
ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling 
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 8 of 56 molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based 
switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatas es 
SHP-1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are involved in 
the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade (1 1, 13 -15).  The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_261291] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971] ( 7, 16).  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on activated 
lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer 
cells (17, 18) .  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - 
(double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells (1 9).  The 
ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety 
of cell types, including non- hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors ( 4-8).  Both 
ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the 
extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_261292] notably 
on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-
presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is 
thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to 
dampen unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral tissues (1 8).  Although healthy organs express 
little ( if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this 
T-cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in 
subjects with melanoma (MEL) ( 20) .  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a 
critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for 
therapeutic intervention. 
 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly  selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -
L1 and PD -L2.  Keytruda
TM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United Stated 
for the treatment  of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and dis ease progression 
following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.

1.2.1 Rationale for Dosing  
 An open- label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial 
evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2  
weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of 
MK-3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size 
reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been 
identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK -3475 program has 
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 9 of 56 shown that a lower dose of MK -3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for 
target engagement and clinical activity.  
 
PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  
Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement 
is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.    A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data from [ADDRESS_261293] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based 
regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 –  
5.0 for MK -3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the 
notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed 
dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5- fold higher dose and exposure). The population 
PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on 
exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanom a 
indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  
 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of 
pembrolizumab in solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safet y of 
pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and 
safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of 
tumo r burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by 
[CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W a s an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is 
based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obt ained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will 
maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
 
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for 
physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistic al chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
 
1.3 Study Rationale  
Protocol Version:  04/09/[ADDRESS_261294] a relatively good 
prognosis with surgery alone or surgery plus radiation (21). However, 10 -15% of patients are  
diagnosed with stage III disease at the time of s urgery, and have an estimated 5 year survival 
rate of 40 -70%  (22). Lastly, the r emaining 10 -15% of patients are diagnosed with stage IV 
disease and have a very poor 5 year survival of 0 -10% (23). 
 Those patients  with advanced disease are unlikely to be cured by [CONTACT_44850] , chemotherapy and/or 
radiation alone. In addition, the prognosis for recurrent disease is even more  dismal, with 
expected overall survival of only 14- 15 months. It is well- known that more aggressive 
histologies such as serous and clear cell carcinoma cause a disproportionate amount of recurrent cases and ultimately deaths therefore requiring more aggressive treatment even in early stage disease.  
 The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network published that uterine serous carcinomas and approximately 25% of high- grade endometrioid cancers had extensive copy number alterations 
and frequent TP53 mutations. Additionally, there were frequent mutations in PTEN, CNNB1, PIK3CA, ARID1A, ARID5B and KRAS. Uterine serous carcinomas shared genomic features 
with ovarian serous carcinomas  (3). 
 Much work needs to be done with regards to managing patients with advanced stage or recurrent disease. The current standard is systemic treatment with  paclitaxel and carboplatin . A large 
phase III non -inferiority study performed by  [CONTACT_84542] (GOG) 
compared paclitaxel/carboplatin versus  a three drug regimen of paclitaxel, doxorubicin and 
cisplatin (TAP) and showed that paclitaxel/carboplatin was not inferior to TAP in terms of PFS 
and OS.  Overall, paclitaxel and carboplatin also had a favorable toxicity profile
 (24, 25) .  According to 
the Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_70299] (SEER) study of cases diagnosed from 1998 -
2001, the five -year survival rate ( 26): 
• Among women with stage  III cancers, it was 33, 48, 48 for serous, clear cell, and grade 3 
endometrioid cancers respectively.  
• Among women with stage IV cancer, it was 18, 18, [ADDRESS_261295] been identified to improve this dismal statistic of survival 
for patients with stages III/IV endometrial cancer.  
 Vanderstraeten et al. used a composite immunohistochemistry  scoring which included the 
subparts of the percentage of total tumor cells showing expression and the intensity of the staining  to evaluate indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase, PD -L1, and PD -L2 in mainly grade 3 
endometrioid, clear cell and papi[INVESTIGATOR_217763] .  Eighty -three  percent of primary  
endometrial  tumors showed high expression of PD -L1, and there was a trend to improved 
overall survival in patients with high expression of PD -L1. Sixty -seven and one hundred percent 
of recurrent and metastatic endometrial cancers had high expression of PD -L1 (2). Gatalica and 
colleagues surveyed several common cancer types and confirmed in 16 cases of endometrial cancer that there was 88% PD -L1 expression in tumor cells and concurrent PD -1 and PD -LI 
expression in 79% ( 27). Interferon -gamma and CD8
+ T cells cause upregulation of PD -L1. 
Therefore, PD -L1 expression could be viewed as a result of ongoing endogenous anti -tumor 
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 11 of 56 immune response and may represent a negative feedback loop dependent on an infiltrating 
immun e response (2).   
 Due to the high expression of PD -L1 in endometrial cancers as well as in ovarian cancers which 
are molecularly similar to uterine serous cancers, using pembrolizumab should be beneficial in this patient population. Since we are able to g et a pre- treatment  research - related  endometrial 
biopsy as well as the surgical specimen post two cycles of pembrolizumab , we will be able to 
evaluate the mechanism of action of this drug on the endometrial cancer tumor environment. Please see below for mo re details.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_261296] from MK -3475 therapy.  
  
We hypothesize that MK -3475 will result in increased T cell responses in peripheral blood as 
detected by [CONTACT_217776] a unique biomarker molecular signature [CONTACT_217790]-3475 activity  (28).  MK-[ADDRESS_261297] - MK-3475 treatment to delineate immune cell subsets and cell surface 
activation markers .  Additionally,  pre-treatment tumor tissue is available, FACS or CyTOF will 
also be applied to tumor infiltrating immune cells.    
 A next generation of single -cell analysis technology called mass cytometry overcomes 
limitations of flow cytometry of measuring  a maximum of ten markers per panel. The CyTOF 
(Cytometry of Time Of Flight) is a mass spectrometer -flow cytometer hybrid instrument that 
uses stable isotopes instead of fluorophores as reporters.  Due to the discrete read- outs of mass 
cytometry, use of is otopes as reporters enables a significant increase in the number of 
measurable parameters per cell.  CyTOF will be used to detect changes in immune populations and markers.  Additionally panels can be designed with up to 45 antibodies focused completely on surface markers to delineate cellular hierarchy and intracellular signaling molecules.  This 
will allow us to focus on the activation states of intracellular signaling pathways  (29).  
 
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 12 of 56 Additionally , T cell immune repertoire diversity based on the detection of V-J arrangements of 
the T cell receptor (TCR) will allow monitoring of immune diversity in blood or tumors  (30) .

min/+10 min) on an outpatient basis.  MK -[ADDRESS_261319] of care adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy ± radiation).  F or patients whose 
pathology confirms  high- risk features  and advanced stage , MK-[ADDRESS_261320] of 6 cycles of paclitaxel 175mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 5 every 3 
weeks if patient has adequate blood and chemistry values for 6 cycles.  Docetaxel can be 
substituted for paclitaxel per institutional guidelines if a patient suffers a hypersensitivity 
reaction. Chemotherapy cycles may be delayed per treating physician’s discretion.  
 Paclitaxel will be infused over approximately 3 hours.  Carboplatin will be infused over approximately 30 minutes, following paclitaxel.  
 For all cycles where paclitaxel is to be administered, it is recommended that a  
preparative regimen be employed, to reduce the risk associated with  hypersensitivity 
reactions. This regimen should include dexamethasone (either IV  or PO), an anti -
histamine H1 (diphenhydramine 25- 50 mg IV or orally, or an equivalent dose of an 
alternate H1blocker such as loratadine or fexofenadine), and a standard dose of 
antihistamine H2 IV (Famotidine is preferred, but ranitidine  can also be used). The 
preparative regimen can be altered at the discretion of the treating physician.

vaccine.  
• Systemic g lucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  Steroids may be used as 
anti-emetics around the time of chemotherapy delivery , which may occur more than [ADDRESS_261324] -operative 
dosing . In the immediate per ioperative period patients receive steroids to help with 
wound edema from surgery. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be 
approved.  
 
Patients may receive myeloid growth factors either filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) can be used per 
institution al guidelines. This may only be used during administration of chemotherapy +  
radiation therapy and not  during the pre -operative or post -adjuvant therapy of MK -3475.  
 
5.4.1 Supportive Care Guidelines for Infusion Reactions  
 
Pembrolizumab may cause severe or life -threatening reactions including severe 
hypersensitivity or an aphy laxis.  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly 
after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.   The table below shows treatment guidelines for patients who experience an infusion reaction associated with MK -3475.

5.5 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential ( defined as women with regular menses , women with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that precludes 
withdrawal bleeding , and w omen who have had a tubal ligation) are required to have a negative 
serum or urine pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_261326] -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  Women in the following categories are not considered of childbearing  potential:  
 
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 21 of 56 • Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical  records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
 
• Postmenopausal female  
o A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
 A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of [ADDRESS_261327] discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of 
postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
 
Contraception Requirements  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the 
study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described 
below ) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior  to the initiation of study 
medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_261328] should not be entered into the 
study.  
 
Female Participants  
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they  agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in the table 
below  during the protocol -defined time frame.  
 
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent a  
Failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.

● Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS) b  
● Intrauterine device (IUD)  
● Bilateral tubal occlusion  
● Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has 
been confirmed.  If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should 
be used.  
● Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
treatment.  The reliability of sexual abstinence n eeds to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.)  
Notes:  
Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants of clinical studies.  
 
a) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_122955] -use failure rates (i.e. when used consistently and 
correctly).  
b) If hor monal contraception efficacy is potentially decreased due to interaction with study treatment, 
condoms must be used in addition to the hormonal contraception during the treatment period and for at 
least [X days, corresponding to time needed to eliminate st udy treatment plus 30 days for study 
treatments with genotoxic potential] after the last dose of study treatment.  
c) If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable 
hormonal contraceptives are limited  to those which inhibit ovulation.   
 
Pregnancy Testing  
WOCBP should only be included after a negative highly sensitive urine or serum pregnancy 
test.   Following initiation of treatment, pregnancy testing will be performed whenever an expected menstrual c ycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected, after the last dose of study 
treatment, and as required locally.  
 Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever an expected menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  
 
5.6 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, the protocol therapy 
should be discontinued and the reason(s) fo r discontinuation documented in the case report 
forms.  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for up to 4  
doses of MK -3475 in the adjuvant setting following surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy +/ - 
radiation therapy  or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Documented and confirmed disease progression  
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 23 of 56 • Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment  of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment  of the investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious non- compliance with the study protocol  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator re moves the patient from study

6.2.1 Individual Dose Modification Levels  
 
All modifications are relative to the actual starting doses for the specific Regimen.  For 
application of individual dose modifications, see specific guidelines below.  
 
Allowable drug dose levels and instructions are summarized in Tables A, B, and C.

• Hematologic Nadirs, Table A  
• Delayed Hematologic Recovery, Table B  
• Non-Hematologic Toxicity, Table C  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_261336] of cycle delay and/or dose reduction as 
directed.  Treatment decisions will be based on the absolute neutrophil count (ANC)  
rather than the total white cell count (WBC).  
 
6.2.3 Lower Limits for ANC and Platelet Count  
 
Subsequent courses of treatment  which contain any cytotoxic chemotherapy  
(carboplatin, paclitaxel) will not begin ( day 1 of each cycle ) until the ANC is ≥1,500 
cells/ mcl and the platelet count is ≥ 100,000/ mcl. Such treatment will be delayed for a  
maximum of three weeks until these values are achieved. Patients who fail to recover  
adequate counts within a three -week delay will no longer receive any protocol -directed 
therapy.  
 
Exceptions:  
Patients who received filgrast im or pegfilgrastim prior to the current cycle may begin  
(day 1 of cycle) with ANC ≥ 1000 cells/mcl, if clinically appropriate, to allow for  
transient reductions in ANC after discontinuation of myeloid growth factors. Patients  
who are delayed more than 7 d ays may begin with ANC ≥ 1000 cells/ mcl, if clinically  
appropriate; and if they will receive filgrastim or pegfilgrastim with subsequent therapy.  
 
6.2.4 Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity (Nadirs)  
 
Initial occurrence of dose -limiting neutropenia (defined in 6.15) or dose  limiting 
thrombocytopenia (defined in 6.16) will be handled according to Table A.  
 Dose -Limiting Neutropenia (DLT -ANC) is defined by [CONTACT_217778]:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 27 of 56 neutropenia or prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia persisting ≥ 7 days. There will be no  
modifications for uncomplicated Grade 4 neutropenia  lasting less than 7 days. Febrile 
neutropenia is defined as a disorder  characterized by [CONTACT_217779] <1000/mm3 and a single 
temperature of >38.3°C (101°F) or a sustained temperature of ≥ 38°C (100.4°F) for more 
than one hour. Dose reductions will be handled according to Table A.  
 
Dose -limiting thrombocytopenia (DLT -PLT) is defined by [CONTACT_217780] 4 
thrombocytopenia or bleeding associated with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. There will be 
no modifications f or uncomplicated Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Dose reductions will be 
handled according to Table A.

6.2.5 Modifications for Delayed Hematologic Recovery:  
 
Delay on the basis of neutropenia (Delay -ANC) is defined if the ANC is  less than 1,500 
cells/mcl within 24 hours prior to scheduled day 1 therapy, or less than 1,000 cells/mcl, if the patient received filgrastim or  pegfilgrastim during the previous cycle. 
 Delay on the basis of thrombocytopenia (Delay -PLT) is defined if the  platelet count is 
less than 100,000/mcl within 24 hours prior to scheduled day 1 therapy.  
 Modifications noted below are only required for management of delays in  the absence of 
dose reductions stipulated by [CONTACT_217781] -ANC and/or DLT -PLT (as noted above). In 
other words, if the patient experiences D LT-ANC  and Delay -ANC, make the 
modifications as indicated for the nadir counts without additional modifications based on delayed recovery.

The development of Grade 2 (or greater) peripheral neuropathy requires reduction of one 
dose level in paclitaxel. If CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy occurs then subsequent doses of paclitaxel will be delayed for a maximum of three weeks until recovered to CTCAE Grade ≤ 2. If peripheral neuropathy fails to recover to Grade ≤ 2 by 
a maximum delay of three weeks from time therapy is due, then all paclitaxel should be 
withheld from all subsequent chemotherapy cycles.  
Renal toxicity (associated with redu ction in GFR) is not expected as a direct 
complication of chemotherapy in this chemotherapy naive patient population using the prescribed dose and schedule of each regimen.  See Appendix C  (Carboplatin Dose 
Calculation Instructions).  
 Hepatic toxicity is not expected as a direct complication of chemotherapy in this 
chemotherapy naive patient population using the prescribed dose and schedule for each 
regimen. However, the development of Grade 3 (or greater) elevations in AST, ALT, 
alkaline phosphatase or bi lirubin requires reduction of one dose level in paclitaxel and 
delay in subsequent therapy for a maximum of three weeks until recovered to Grade 1.  
 There will be no dose modifications for alopecia or controllable nausea, vomiting, 
constipation, or diarrhe a. It is recommended that routine medical measures be employed 
to manage nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea.

7.5.1 Reporting Overdose  
 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 
1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available 
on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment 
should be provided if clinically indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject should be 
observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
 
If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] 
product , the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other 
seriousness criteria are met.  
 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product  meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without 
any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non -serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology 
“accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
 All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days  to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: 
Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 661- 6229 ) 
 
7.5.2 Reporting Pregnancy and Lactation  
 
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding  are not considered 
adverse events, it is the responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any 
Protocol Version:  04/09/[ADDRESS_261340] (spontaneously reported to them) that occurs during 
the trial.  
 Pregnancies and infant exposures during breastfeeding  that occur after the consent form 
is signed but before treatment allocation/randomization must be reported by [CONTACT_217782], or are the result of a 
protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation 
of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.   
 Pregnancies and infant  exposures during breastfeeding  that occur from the time of 
treatment allocation/randomization through 120 days following cessation of Sponsor’s product, or [ADDRESS_261341] be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be 
reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to 
term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.  
 Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days 
to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 661- 6229)

Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 36 of 56 8.2 Paclitaxel  
 
8.2.1 Formulation  
 
Paclitaxel is supplied as a 6mg/mL non -aqueous solution in  multi- dose vials containing 
30mg/5mL, 100mg/16.7mL, or 300mg/ 50mL  of paclitaxel  In addition to 6mg of 
paclitaxel, each mL of sterile nonpyrogen ic solution contains 527mg of purified 
Cremophor® EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil) and 49.7% (v/v) dehydrated alcohol, 
USP.  
 
8.2.2 Storage  
 
Unopened vials of paclitaxel are stable to the date indicated on  the package when stored 
between 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F). Protect from  light.  
 
8.2.3 Stability  
 
Commercially available paclitaxel will be labeled with an  expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]. All solutions 
of paclitaxel exhibit a slight haziness directly  proportional to the concentration of drug 
and the time elapsed after  preparation, although when prepared as described below, 
solutions of  paclitaxel (0.3 -1.2 mg/ml) are physically and chemically stable for [ADDRESS_261348] be diluted prior to infusion. Paclitaxel should  be diluted in 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride for Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose  Injection, US P; 5% Dextrose and 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP;  or 5% Dextrose in Ringer’s Injection to a final 
concentration of 0.3 to 1.2mg/mL. The solutions are physically and chemically stable for 
up to 27 hours at ambient temperature (approximately 25°C / 77° F) and room  lighting 
conditions. 
 
NOTE: In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP,  which may be 
leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, diluted paclitaxel  solutions should be stored in 
bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic  (polyprop ylene, polyolefin) bags and 
administered through polyethylene  lined  administration sets.  
 
Paclitaxel should be administered through an inline filter with a  microporous membrane 
not greater than 0.22 microns. Use of filter  devices such as IVEX -2® or IVEX -HP®, 
which incorporate short inlet  and outlet PVC -coated tubing has not resulted in 
significant leaching of  DEHP.  
 All patients should be premedicated with corticosteroids,  diphenhydramine, and H2 
antagonists prior to paclitaxel administration in  order to prevent severe hypersensitivity 
reactions. Patients who experience severe hypersensitivity  reactions to paclitaxel should 
not be re -challenged  with the drug.

Protocol Version:  04/09/[ADDRESS_261350]. Hag emann will then confirm the tumor histology, cellularity and 
viability of the se samples by H&E.  
 In the event that the research biopsy does not yield sufficient tissue to be able to perform the correlative studies required, the FFPE archival b lock from the original diagnostic 
procedure will be requested. Consent and release of records will be utilized to obtain the block which  is required from the pathology department of origin. Laboratory personnel 
will use to block to cut  up to 10 slides to include 1 sli de for H&E staining and the rest 
(5µm, charged slides) to be used to complete the correlative studies.  The block will then 
be returned to the originating pathology department. Additionally, RNA will be obtained 
from FFPE slides or fresh frozen tumors for RNA profiling  of pre - and post -
pembrolizumab treated tumors.  
 
Up to 10 additional tissue samples from patients with either advanced  stage endometrial 
or ovarian cancer, and some normal endometri um or ovarian  tissue samples  will be 
requested from our Gynecologic Oncology Tissue Bank (IRB#:201105400)  at 
Washington University in St. Louis.  
 
In addition, up to [ADDRESS_261351]. Fuh’s lab and no identifying 
except some minimal clinical data to confirm histology and advanced stage cancer  will 
be associated with the samples. These matched blood and tissue samples will be used as 
controls for the CyTof testing as well as optimization as described below.

blood will be analyzed by [CONTACT_217784] -1. 
CD3+ infiltrates in tumors and TCR repertoir e expansion, and antibody arrays will also 
be performed. IHC on pre -and post -treatment tumor samples to examine for immune cell 
infiltrates will be performed  which include but are not limited to T cells: CD3, CD4, 
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 39 of 56 CD8, CD25, Foxp3; B cells: CD19, CD20, MDS C: Siglec -3/CD33, Lineage negative,

CD16, CD5, CD107, CD3- ; Macrophages/TAMs: CD11b+, CD11c -, CD68 .  
IHC intensity will be graded by 2 blinded reviewers for both intensity and frequenc y of 
staining by [CONTACT_106886].  IHC staining for PD -L1 will be performed PD -L1 assessment 
with the prototype assay as developed by [CONTACT_44873].  The following scoring system will be 
used as performed in the pembrolizumab paper in NSCLC.  The intensity of the infiltrates will be graded by [CONTACT_2329] a proportion score (PS), defined as the percentage  of 
cells with membranous PD -L1 staining at any intensity . A p roportion score of 2+ or 3+ 
(P2S) is defined as the percentage of cells with membranous PD - L1 staining at 
modera te (2+) or strong (3+) intensity .  A proportion score 3+ (P3S) is  defined as the 
percentage of cells with membranous PD -L1 staining at strong intensity (3+) .  A 
modified H -score (HS) provides a numerical value that accounts for the proportion of 
cells stai ning for PD -L1 at each of th e [ADDRESS_261353] -MK-3475 treatment to delineate 
immune cell subsets and cell surface activation markers. Tissue  samples requested from 
the tissue bank of the Division of Gynecologic Oncology  will be used as control s. 
CyTOF will also be applied to analyze the tumor infiltrating immune cells (eg. 
CD3+TIL). The breadth of the immune response will be evaluated b y TCR repertoire 
expansion (for the cellular a rm), and antibody array (for the humoral response).  
 
9.2 Peripheral Blood for Biomarkers  
 
9.2.1 Collection of Spe cimens  
 
Blood samples (10 -15 mL) will be collected and fixed using a fixation/stabilization 
buffer (Smart Tube Inc.) within 30 min of phlebotomy and stored at −80 °C. Collection 
will be performed prior to first dose of MK -3475, prior to second dose of MK-3475, day 
of surgery, after adjuvant therapy  and prior to resuming first dose of MK -3475 after 
adjuvant therapy , and every other administration of MK -3475  in adjuvant setting  (pre-
dose 2 and 4 of MK -3475) . 
 
9.2.2 Handling of Specimens  
 
Samples will be  thawed on the day of processing. Red blood cells will be  lysed using a 
hypotonic buffer (Smart Tube Inc.). P eripheral blood leukocytes will be washed and 
resuspended in cell staining medium. This will be performed in the laboratory of 
Katherine Fuh, MD, PhD.  Using the immunomonitoring core of CHiiPs, we will apply CyTOF multiparameter analysis of PBMCs pre - and post - MK-3475 treatment to 
delineate immune cell  subsets and cell surface activation markers  (similar markers as 
was performed for the endometrial tumors as for blood) . Blood samples from the tissue 
bank of the Division of Gynecologic Oncology will be used as control s. CyTOF will also 
be applied to anal yze the tumor infiltrating immune cells (e.g. CD3+ TIL). The breadth 
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 40 of 56 of immune response will be evaluated by [CONTACT_217785] (for the cellular 
arm), and antibody array (for the humoral response).

For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response per table 10.1 and 
per the treating physician’s discretion if there is a concern of progression sooner   In addition to 
a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
 Response an d progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca 45:228- 247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimen sional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
  
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 43 of 56 12.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured 
in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_261361] x -ray, as >[ADDRESS_261362] scan, or >[ADDRESS_261363] be 
recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 Malignant lymph nodes :  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be >[ADDRESS_261364] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.  
 Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions , leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measu rable lesions, 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions :  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter) , be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not requir ed, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 44 of 56 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characte rize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 Clinical lesio ns:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Convention al CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_261365] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MR I, which greatly 
impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of 
MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of 
the scanning sequences used should be optimized for  the evaluation of the type and site of 
disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was 
used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECI ST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence 
parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should 
be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans.  Bo dy scans should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 
PET -CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT 
is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  H owever, 
if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be 
used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guarant eed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the 
next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_217786]:  04/09/[ADDRESS_261366] in selected instances.  
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsie s are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following 
complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper norma l limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian 
cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [JNCI 96:487- 488, 
2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461- 3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol 26:1148 -1159, 2008] .  In addition, the 
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_261367]- line trials in ovar ian cancer [ JNCI 
92:1534- 1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiat e between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect 
of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 FDG -PET:   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follo w-up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  
• No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not con firmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -
PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at fo llow-up corresponds to a pre -existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
• FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographi c abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in 
the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledge d that both approaches may lead to false positive CR 
due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
  
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 46 of 56 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
  
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 47 of 56 12.4 Response Criteria  
 
12.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
 
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more  new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
12.4.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short 
axis).  
 Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they mus t normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally 
trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not 
a single lesion increase.      Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_343], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
 
12.4.[ADDRESS_261368] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatm ent started).  The patient's best response 
assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

accepted as disease progression.  
Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported 
as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

SD is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to 
assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised  
  
12.4.4 Duration of Respon se 
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the 
first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive d isease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started).  
 
Protocol Version:  04/09/[ADDRESS_261369] date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  
 Duration of s table disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

 14.1 Study Design  
 
This single arm, phase I study will investigate the safety of treatment with MK -3475 in women 
with advanced endometrial adenocarcinoma.  
 14.2 Study Endpoints  
 
The primary endpoint is safety as measured by [CONTACT_217787]. Secondary endpoints include 2 -year progression -free survival (PFS) for all the e ndometrial 
adenocarcinoma patients treated with MK -3475, as well as the anti -endometrial tumor immune 
response before and after treatment with MK -3475 as measured by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 IHC expression, 
immune function in blood and tumor tissue, and immune correlates.  
 
14.3 Data Analysis  
 
Demographic and clinical characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. PFS 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier (KM) method. Paired t -test and/or paired -sample Wilcoxon 
Signed Rank test will be used to compare the anti -endometr ial tumor immune response before

APPENDIX B:  Carboplatin Dose Calculation Instructions  
 
• The Cockcroft -Gault  formula  will be used in this trial. 
• Conversion of IDMS  creatinine  levels  to “non- IDMS”  values  will not be permitted.  
• The carboplatin calculation  tool is available on the GOG website  (Web  Menu,  Tools). 
 
1) Dosing of Carboplatin:  
 
2) The carboplatin dose will be calculated  to reach  a target  area under  the curve (AUC)  according  to 
the Calvert  formula  using  an estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate (GFR)  from  the Cockcroft -Gault  
formula.  
 
3) The initial dose of carboplatin  must  be calculated  using  GFR.  In the absence of renal  toxicity  
greater  than or equal  to CTCAE  Grade 2 (serum  creatinine >1.[ADDRESS_261375])  or toxicity  requiring  dose 
modification,  the dose of carboplatin  will not need  to be recalculated  for subsequent  cycles,  but 
will be subject  to dose modification  for toxicity  as noted in the protocol.  
 
4) Carboplatin doses  are required  to be recalculated  if the patient  has a weight  change  of greater  than 
or equal  to 10%. Patients  are permitted  to have  chemotherapy  doses  recalculated  for < 10% 
weight  changes.  
 
5) At the time of dose modification,  if the patient’s  age had changed  (the patient  has had a 
birthday), the site can use the current  age. 
 
6) In patients  with an abnormally  low serum  creatinine (less than 0.7 mg/dl),  the creatinine  
clearance  should be estimated  using  a minimum value  of 0.7 mg/dl.  For trials  where  
patients enter and are treated within less than or equal to 12 weeks of surgery: If a more  
appropriate (higher) baseline creatinine value is available from the pre- operative period  
(within 4 weeks of surgery date), that value may also be used for the initial estimation of  
GFR.  
 
CALVERT FORMULA:  
Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC x (GFR + 25)  
 
NOTE: the GFR used in the Calver t formula should not exceed 125 ml/min. 
 Maximum carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC (mg/ml x min) x 150 ml/min.  
The maximum allowed doses of carboplatin are:  
AUC 6 = 900 mg AUC 5 = 750 mg AUC 4 = 600 mg   
For the purposes of this protocol, the GFR is consi dered to be equivalent to the estimated  
creatinine clearance. The estimated creatinine clearance (ml/min) is calculated by [CONTACT_217789] -Gault using the following formula:  
 
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 55 of 56 Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = [140 -Age (years)] x Weight (kg) x 0.85 
72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl)  
 
Notes:  
1) Weight in kilograms (kg):  
a. Body Mass Index (BMI) should be calculated for each patient. A BMI calculator is  
available at the following link: http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/  
b. Actual weight should be used for estimation of GFR for patients with BMI of less than 25.  
c. Adjusted weight should be used for estimation of GFR for patients with BMI of greater  
than or equal to 25. 
d. Adjusted weight calculation:  
Ideal weight (kg) = (((Height (cm)/2.54) – 60) x 2.3) + 45.5  
Adjusted weight (kg) = ((Actual weight – Ideal weight) x 0.40) + Ideal weight  
 
2) The Cockcroft -Gault formula above is specifically for women (it includes the 0.85 factor).  
 
At the time of a dose modification for toxicity : If the creatinine at the time  of a dose  
modification is lower than the creatinine used to calculate the previous dose, use the previous  
(higher) creatinine; if the creatinine at the time of a dose modification is higher than the  
creatinine used to calculate the previous dose, use the current (higher) creatinine. This will  
ensure that the patient is actually receiving a dose reduction.  
    
 
 
   
 
 
           
 
    
Protocol Version:  04/09/18 Amendment 4  Page 56 of 56 APPENDIX C:  General Chemotherapy Guidelines  
 
• For [ADDRESS_261376]  a new cycle  of chemotherapy  
delayed  up to 7 days (without  this being  considered to be a protocol  violation)  for major  
life events  (e.g.,  serious  illness  in a family  member,  major  holiday,  vacation  which  is 
unable  to be re-scheduled). Documentation  to justify  this decision  should  be provided.  
 
• It will be acceptable for individual  chemotherapy  doses  to be delivered  within  a “24-
hour window  before  and after the protocol -defined  date” for “Day  1” treatment  of 21 or 
28 day cycles.  If the treatment due date is a Friday,  and the patient  cannot  be treated  on 
that Friday,  then the window  for treatment  would include  the Thursday  (1 day earlier  
than due) through the Monday  (day [ADDRESS_261377] due).  
 
• For weekly  regimens,  it will be acceptable  for individual  chemotherapy  doses  to be 
delivered  within  a “24-hour window,”  for example;  “Day  8 chemotherapy” can be 
delivered  on Day 7, Day 8, or Day 9 and “Day  15 chemotherapy” can  be given  on Day  14, 
Day 15, or Day  16. 
 
• Chemotherapy  doses  can be “rounded”  according  to institutional  standards  without  
being considered  a protocol  violation  (most  institutions  use a rule of approximately  
+/- 5% of the calculated  dose).  
 
• Chemotherapy  doses  are required  to be recalculated  if the patient  has a weight  change 
of greater  than or equal  to 10%. Patients  are permitted  to have  chemotherapy  doses  
recalculated  for < 10% weight  changes.  
 
• Maximum  body  surface area used for chemotherapy  dose calculations  will be 2.0 m2. For 
chemotherapy  dose calculations  that use mg/kg,  there will be no maximum kilogram  
amount  used (doses  will be calculated  on actual  weight  in kg).

[ADDRESS_1150071] common elective surgeries in the U.S.A. Pain control after 
surgery remains challenging despi[INVESTIGATOR_828787] 
(32-33). Three -quarters  of surgical patients in the [LOCATION_002] experience postoperative pain and 
are unsatisfied with their analgesia (28 -29). The major cause of pre -operative anxiety in any 
surgical patient is fear of postoperative pain (18). Pain is a psychological sensory experience, 
which is caused by [CONTACT_327029]. Surgery results in tissue damage which leads to postoperative 
pain. Studies in recently developed animal models of postoperative pain have advanced our 
knowledge of the mechanisms of pain resulting from surgi cal incision and associated tissue injury.  
 
Post-operative pain has numerous etiologies and many contributing factors; it thus usually 
responds best to multimodal approaches (28 -29). Pain may result from tissue trauma secondary to 
stretching and compressio n or direct nerve injury as a result of surgical incisions and burns (1 -6). 
Pain is aggravated by [CONTACT_828821], sneezing, moving etc. or any other movement, which increases 
pressure over the surgical area. Most clinicians consider nerve blocks to be the optima l approach, 
but many patients nonetheless require opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
 
Ineffective pain control results in increased mortality and morbidity (7 -8, 22). For example, 
surgery provokes immune depression, which may have deleterious effects. Reducing postoperative 
pain ma y speed mobilization and reduce pulmonary and cardiac complications, whereas early 
mobilization reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis. This implies that, if post -operative pain is 
treated effectively, then costs of care could be decreased significantly.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1150072] herpetic neuralgia and seizure disorders. It binds 
to alpha -2 delta subunit of presynaptic P/Q voltage gated calcium channels, which regulate the 
release of excit atory neurotransmitters from nociceptive receptors (4). Gabapentinoids can 
decrease post -operative pain by [CONTACT_828822][INVESTIGATOR_828788] d brain. 
Gabapentin is absorbed through the duodenum, only minimally protein bound and renally 
excreted. Antacids interact with gabapentin to impair its absorption.  
 
Gabapentin reaches peak plasma concentrations about two hours after oral administration, and its 
half-life is between 4.8 -8.7 hours; hence, it is given in two daily doses. Since gabapentin is renally 
excreted, the dose should be reduced in patients with renal dysfunction, especially when creatinine 
> 1.50 mg/dl (15 -16). Side effects include se dation, dizziness, headache, visual disturbances, and 
peripheral edema (17).  
 
 
Version 7.[ADDRESS_1150073] -operative pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (9 -11). 
Postoperative delirium a complication of general anesthesia is less common afte r gabapentin 
administration (24). In 2012, Mahdi Panah Khahi et al compared visual analog scores and fentanyl 
use in patients given gabapentin pre -operatively and immediately post -incision via nasogastric 
tube. Patients given gabapentin preoperatively had lower visual analog scores and required less 
fentanyl than those given the drug later (30).  
 
In another study, less morphine was required in patients given gabapentin both pre - and post -
operatively than just pre -operatively. A knee -flexion test was used t o check the efficacy of post -
operative gabapentin on post -operative pain, which revealed better flexion in patients using both 
pre- and post -operative gabapentin (12). In a qualitative and quantitative review in patients who 
had abdominal hysterectomy and spi[INVESTIGATOR_61691], gabapentin decreased pain scores, use of narcotics 
and symptoms like nausea and vomiting when given pre and peri -operatively(31,34).  
 
A study by [CONTACT_828823] -emptive use of gabapentin reduced pain scores on 
both post -operative day 1 and day 2 and use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_828789] (13). Using high dose gabapentin (600 mg) lead to lower pain scores than low dose 
300 mg in patients who had lumbar discectomies. Similarly, preempti ve use of 600 mg gabapentin 
orally in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomies required low amounts of analgesic and 
antiemetics (14, 20, and 23 ). 
 
 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
 
Multimodal approach  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_828790], but cause side effects including sedation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], 
hypotension, nausea, and constipation. Hence, opi[INVESTIGATOR_828791], 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), acetaminophen, ketamine, or other agents in an 
effort to re duce postoperative pain while minimizing side effects, an approach termed “multi -
modal analgesia” (25 -27). NSAIDs are antipyretic and anti -inflammatory, but provoke surgical 
and gastrointestinal bleeding; renal impairment and they also impair bone healing.  The main goal 
is to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_828792]. 
Non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_828793], but have substantial opi[INVESTIGATOR_828794] -related 
complications.  
 
In summary, opi[INVESTIGATOR_727152]. They also delay discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], increase the cost of care, and reduce patient 
satisfaction.  
 
Multimodal analgesia is believed to decrease length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], decrease the cost of care, 
and shorten recovery (19 -21). Multimodal analgesia a decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and hence is thought 
to indirectly reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced side effects and  complications including respi[INVESTIGATOR_828795]. NSAIDS, acetaminophen, ketamine, and pregabalin have been tried in the past as 
adjuncts to decrease overall consumption of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Acetaminophen is opi[INVESTIGATOR_425213], but must 
be used cautiously in p atients with impaired liver function (35, 36, and 37 ). 
 
The impact of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_828796] a clinical 
perspective, but also from an economic standpoint. The additional cost attributable to opi[INVESTIGATOR_828797] 7.[ADDRESS_1150074] of GEn and, more 
importantly, the reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related complications.  
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
We would like to test an extended -release formulation of gabapentin enacarbil, a prodrug of 
gabapentin, a FDA approved drug for post herpetic neuralgia and restless leg syndrome (43). 
Extended release gabapentin enacarbil and gabapentin are different in th eir pharmacokinetics and 
have variable but predictable bioavailability (39). This results in different plasma concentrations 
at the same doses (39). It is shown to provide dose -proportionality and extended exposure to 
gabapentin over the range 300 to 6,000  mg (39). At high doses gabapentin transporters in the 
intestines get saturated, this could be overcome by [CONTACT_828824] (38). GEn is absorbed via high capacity nutrient 
transporter s located throughout the intestinal tract thus providing a predictable dose proportionality 
and improved bioavailability. A [ADDRESS_1150075] 312 mg of 
gabapentin on hydrolysis (39, 40).  
 
A more predictable gabapentin e xposure is achieved due to linear relationship of dose -exposure 
for gabapentin enacarbil and hence the dosing frequency could be decreased (41). Per PI [INVESTIGATOR_828798] 600 mg (Horizant) is 5.0 hours (fasted) and 7.3 hours (fed). GEn provides more 
sustained dose proportional exposure to gabapentin (unlike gabapentin), which may lead to more 
predictable exposure with GEn and decreased dosing frequency relative to gabapentin. Due to the 
mechanism of action of GEn and its predictable bioavailability du e to it absorption via the MCT -
[ADDRESS_1150076] the hypothesis that gabapentin enacarbil when used as a modality of pre -
emptive analgesia decreases opi[INVESTIGATOR_525569]/or decreases pain  scores in hip and knee 
arthroplasty surgery.  
 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary and secondary objectives  
 
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of gabapentin enacarbil [ADDRESS_1150077] -operative versus placebo in reducing the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_244911]/or pain scores in post -hip and knee arthroplasty surgery patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227].  
  
Using a randomized de sign and blinded assessments, our goal is to determine whether Gabapentin 
enacarbil when used as a modality of pre -emptive analgesia decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_525569]/or 
decreased pain scores in hip and knee arthroplasty surgery.  
 
The proposed research wil l have the following aims:

7 Data will be collected through personal interview and through electronic medical records. Data 
will also be collected through the phone call made 3 months after surgery.  
Pre-operative data collection : 
1. Pain scores using numerical rating scores (NRS) during the pre -operative evaluation visit  
2.  Brief pain inventory (BPI) at pre -operative evaluation visit.  
3. Demographic data to be obtained includes height (cm), weight (kg), age (yr.), gender, 
(ASA) physical status, and self -declared ethni city.  
4. Patients will be questioned for social history (tobacco) and medical history (pulmonary 
disease, kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, neurological disease, chronic pain conditions, 
illegal drug usage, alcohol abuse, myocardial infarction, previous surgery or stent placement 
and medications usage).  
5. Available preoperative laboratory tests and medication list will be recorded.  
6. Individual risk for nausea and vomiting will be determined using the Apfel score.  
 
Post-operative data collection :

8 Phone calls will be made purely to remind patients to take their pre -operative medication.  
9 Phone calls will be made to check for any adverse  event and with the intention to assess chronic 
pain.  
10 Phone call made for follow -up if the patient is discharge prior to 72 hours.  
 
6.5 Laboratory Procedures  
No samples (e.g., blood, tissue, etc.) need to be shipped offsite for analysis. We will not perform 
any procedures or tests.  
7. STATISTICAL PLAN  
7.[ADDRESS_1150102] on one of these outcomes should be superior. Assuming the pi[INVESTIGATOR_828810] 100 patients and coefficient of variation (SD/mean) of 0.[ADDRESS_1150103] about 90% power to detect the  ratio of 0.63 in geometric means in opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023] (i.e., a geometric mean opi[INVESTIGATOR_828811] 37% in gabapentin 
enacarbil patients) comparing gabapentin enacarbil patients to patients receiving placebo at 
significance level of 0.01 25.  
 
If the assumptions appear to be too optimistic and study turns out to be underpowered, nevertheless 
treatment effects and variability identified in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_828812] a future 
study with sufficient power.  
 
7.2 Statistical Method s 
The modified intention -to-treat approach will be utilize d: patients who were randomized, had the 
procedure and received any amount of  treatment will be included in the analysis. The per -
protocol analysis (on patients who were randomized , had the procedure  and followed the 
treatment regimen at least 50% of the times) will be conducted for the primary outcome as a 
sensitivity analysis.   
First, randomized groups will be compared for balance on potentially confounding baseline 
demographic and preoperative variables using descriptive statistics.   
 
Primary outcome.  In the primary hypothesis, quality of postoperative analgesia will be 
charact erized using both pain scores and total postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_13321] 72 hours 
of the surgery or till discharge. We will consider gabapentin enacarbil group better than placebo 
group on the postoperative pain management if gabapentin enacarbil gr oup is found noninferior 
(i.e., not worse) on both outcomes and superior on at least one of the outcomes. We define the a -
priori noninferiority pain score delta as 1 point and the opi[INVESTIGATOR_828813] 1.1 for the ratio in geometric 
Version 7.0 February 26th, 201 8                   22of 30  
CONFIDENTIAL  means IV morphine equivalent doses (meaning 10% difference between group’s median doses). 
Thus, our primary hypothesis will be assessed in a joint hypothesis -testing framework described 
by [CONTACT_828835] (42).  
 
We will first estimate confidence intervals for the treatment effect fo r both pain score and opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023]. Assuming lognormal distribution of opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], we will evaluate the 
percent difference in geometric mean IV morphine equivalent dose between the two groups using 
a log -linear regression model. To evaluate t he difference in mean pain scores we will first 
summarize the pain scores by [CONTACT_828836] (TWA) pain score for each 
patient. Then we will use a linear regression model to assess the treatment effect on the TWA pain 
scores.  
 
Our joint hyp othesis testing will consist of two steps. First, we will evaluate the noninferiority of 
gabapentin enacarbil to placebo group on both outcomes. Noninferiority (being “not worse”) of 
gabapentin enacarbil group will be concluded for both outcomes at the sig nificance level of 0.025 
if the upper limit of 95% confidence interval is below the corresponding noninferiority delta. 
Second, if noninferiority is concluded for both pain scores and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], we will 
proceed to a [ADDRESS_1150104] on ea ch outcome in the same direction as the noninferiority 
testing. Superiority testing will be done at the overall 0.025 significance level and will be adjusted 
for multiple testing (two outcomes) via Bonferroni correction (0.025/2=0.0125); superiority will 
thus be claimed for a particular outcome if the 97.5% confidence interval is below zero (below one 
for ration in geometric means for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]). Overall Type I error rate for the joint hypothesis testing 
will be maintained at 0.025 (we choose 0.[ADDRESS_1150105] both directions gabapentin enacarbil vs. placebo and placebo vs. gabapentin 
enacarbil) even though both noninferiority and superiority will be tested at the 0.[ADDRESS_1150106] (which does not require additional adjustment for testing two sets of 
hypotheses).  
 
In addition to the confidence intervals, tests giving the P -values for noninferiority and superiority 
will be performed. For noninferiority, two 1 -tailed t -tests for each outcomes will be done to assess 
whether the difference in means pain  scores (or ratio in geometric means for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]) is below the 
given delta (log of given delta for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]). For superiority, two 1 -tailed t -tests will be done in the 
same direction as the noninferiority testing to assess whether the difference in means pain  scores 
(or ratio in geometric means for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]) is below zero (one).  Estimates of treatment effect and 
standard error will be based on the regression models described above. .  
 
Secondary outcomes . We will compare two randomized groups on each secondary o utcome using 
appropriate 2 -tailed tests for superiority: t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous 
outcomes as of duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_828814] -15 satisfaction score.  
To assess if administration of gabapentin enacarbil decreases the incidence  of nausea and vomiting 
within initial 72 hours of the surgery and the risk of pain conversion from acute to chronic chi -
square tests will be used.  
 
The significance level for the set of secondary outcomes will be preserved at 0.05 overall by [CONTACT_2329] 
a crit erion of P < 0.05/4 =0.[ADDRESS_1150107] (applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing 
of the 4 secondary outcomes).

8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
All adverse events (including pre -dosing and treatment -emergent) should be recorded in the 
subject’s record (or, if applicable, in the adverse event section of the CRF) regardless of severity 
or relationship to investigational drug. Information on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case 
report form (CRF).  Al l clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures 
results should be recorded in the source document, and should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course  of each 
event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the 
study treatment or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at 
the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any SAE that 
occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation should be recorded and reported within 24 hours.  
 
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
In acco rdance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 312.32 and the recommendations 
of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) [Federal Register, October 7, 1997, Vol. 
62, No. 194, pp. [ZIP_CODE] -45], any of the following adverse events are to be c lassified as a serious 
adverse event (SAE):  
 
• An event that results in death.  
• An event that, in the view of the Investigator, places the subject at immediate risk of death (a 
life-threatening event). This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a  more severe 
form, might have caused death.  
• An outcome that results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect diagnosed in a child of a subject 
who participated in this study.  
• An event that requires or prolongs in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• An event that results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Other medically important events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. (Exam ples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an in -
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].).

 Background  and Rationale  
Doxorubicin, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase 2a (Top2a), is routinely used in the  
treatment  of breast  cancer,  sarcoma,  and pediatric  leukemia.  Long -term cancer  survivors  
who were treated with doxorubicin often suffer from dose -dependent cardiotoxicity.  Of the 
two topoisomerase 2 isozymes, Top2a is highly expressed in cancer cells and is  required  
for cell division.  However,  adult  cardiomyocytes  express  only topoisomerase  2b (Top2b).  
Studies from our laboratory showed that Top2a mediates doxorubicin’s  tumoricidal 
activity, whereas Top2b mediates doxorubicin’s cardiotoxic effect . At present, 
dexrazoxane is the only FDA-approved drug for cardio -protection.  The cardio - protective  
effect  of dexrazoxane  is due to its ability  to bind to the ATPase  domain  of Top2b    to inhibit 
Top2b’s catalytic cycle.  Currently, dexrazoxane is administered concurrently  with 
doxorubicin. The FDA recommended dose of Dexrazoxane is 10 times the dose of  
Doxorubicin. Because dexrazoxane also binds to Top2a, it has the potential to interfere  
with doxorubicin’s tumoricidal effect.  Thus, dexrazoxane has limited clinical utility as  
specified  by [CONTACT_8415]’s  approved  indication.  In preliminary  studies,  dexrazoxane  induced  an 
ubiquitin/proteasome -mediated  degradation  of Top2b,  but not Top2a.  By 
[CONTACT_751535],  Top2b  will be degraded  
to avoid cardiotoxicity, whereas Top2a will remain intact to preserve tumoricidal  
efficacy . Because the half -life of dexrazoxane is two hours, 93.75% of dexrazoxane will  
be eliminated eight hours (four half -lives) after administration. Indeed, dexrazoxane pre - 
treatment  eight  hours  before  doxorubicin  provided  complete  protection  against  
doxorubicin -induced  cardiotoxicity  in our animal  model. We propose  to conduct  an 
investigator -initiated clinical trial to test this hypothesis. We will use the results from this  
study to design  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_751526].  
 
Objectives  
Primary Objective : To determine the effective dose of Dexrazoxane pre -treatment in  
degrading  topoisomerase 2  b (Top2b)  in human peripheral  blood.  
Secondary Objective s: To determine the time course of Top2b degradation in healthy  
human volunteers. To determine topoisomerase 2 a (Top2a) in human peripheral blood  
will not be  degraded  by [CONTACT_751536] a Phase 1 trial to determine time course and dose of dexrazoxane pre -treatment  
for optimal degradation of Topoisomerase 2 b (Top2b) in human volunteers. The FDA  
recommended  dose  of Dexrazoxane  is [ADDRESS_1028839]  been  prescribed  for many  years . 
There will be 5 cohorts for different doses: 100mg/m2, 200 mg/m2, 300 mg/m2, 400  
mg/m2, or 500 mg/m2. Our plan is to enroll up to 5 subjects per cohort . We will start with  
100 mg/m2  and analyze  the Top2  protein  level from  up to five subjects.  Doses will  
escalate  to
IRB #262180

Version 1 2

Page  3 of 14  
 200 mg/m2, 300 mg/m2, 400 mg/m2, and 500 mg/m2. If 100 mg/m2 dexrazoxane is  
insufficient, we  will increase  the dose  to find the optimal dose.  
A blood sample will be obtained at screening to rule out anemia, pregnancy and to  
determine liver and kidney functions. If the serum pregnancy test is not performed at the  
time of the initial  screening  blood  draw  and another  attempt  is required  in order  to perform  
this test, a urine pregnancy test can be used as a substitute.  A urine pregnancy test will  
be done  on the day  of the 12 -hour infusion  visit, prior  to infusion.  
Subjects  will be administered  a dose  of dexrazoxane  by [CONTACT_93095] 15 (+/-5) minutes.  
Blood will be drawn  to purify  peripheral  blood  leukocytes  for Top2b  and Top2a  
assessment  using  Western  blot analysis.  20 mL of blood  will be drawn  before  
dexrazoxane infusion . 10 mL of blood will be drawn hourly (+/ - 5 minutes) after  the start 
of infusion  for 12 hours . The final lab draw of the 12 -hour infusion day may occur at 6:30 
pm based on facility and  staff availability.  The final blood  draws  occur  at 24 hours (+/ - 2 
hours ); and 48 hours (+/ - 2 hours ) from the start of infusion . A total of [ADDRESS_1028840].   
 
Subjects  will be screened  for COVID  at each  visit per institutional standards.   Subjects  who 
do not pass  the screening  will not be permitted  to continue with the  study.  
 
Vital signs  will be recorded  at the following  time points:  1) screening , 2) pre -infusion, 3) e nd 
of infusion , 4) [ADDRESS_1028841] -infusion , 5) 12-hours post infusion/discharge . Vital signs  to be 
captured include: heartrate; respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]; blood pressure; temperature; pain (rate  pain on 
scale  of 1-10). Height and Weight will  also be recorded  at screening.  
 
A parking voucher will be provided for each visit. During the first [ADDRESS_1028842] a safety CBC one week  (+/- 2 days)  after dexrazoxane infusion to 
rule out  myelosuppression. If the one-week  post-study blood counts are below normal 
range,  subject will  have  additional  CBC two weeks post -infusion.  
Treatment  failure  and subject  removal  criteria  includes:  subject  noncompliance  with blood  
draw,  or, subject  develops  rare hypersensitivity  reactions  to dexrazoxane  infusion.  
 
Study  Population  
Subjects  will be healthy  females,  ages  [ADDRESS_1028843] cancer  
patients; therefore, only women will be enrolled in the study. The protocol was approved

 We plan to enroll  5 subjects  to each  of the 5 cohorts  for a total of up to  25 subjects.  
Participants will be recruited using the UAMS Translational Research Institute (TRI)  
Research Participant Registry, ARresearch.org. After the list of potential participants is  
obtained  from TRI, we will contact  [CONTACT_751538],  if indicated  as their 
communication preference.  The email we will use when communicating with potential  
participants  is included  in the  IRB submission.  
 
Participants will also be recruited using the Facebook pages of UAMS, TRI, and the  
Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute. Participants may also be recruited at 
Community or University events, or from within  UAMS via  word  of mouth.  
Subjects will be asked to self -report on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. However, a  
baseline  blood  sample  will be obtained  to rule out anemia  and pregnancy and  to 
determine  liver and kidney  function.  
 
Inclusion  Criteria  
• Female  
• Age 18-65 years  
Exclusion  Criteria  
• Women  who are pregnant  or breastfeeding  
• Presenting  with an acute  illness  (may  re-screen  again  in two weeks  if illness  has 
subsided)  
• Anemia  (Hb <  12 g/dL  for females)  
• Calculated  Creatinine  Clearance  less than 60 mL/min  
• Liver  function  tests  outside  of normal  range  
• Unwilling  to refrain  from alcohol  consumption  for 48 hours  
 
Participants with medical information suggestive of a chronic medical condition may be  
excluded  from the research at  the enrolling  physician’s  discretion.  
Repeat screening blood tests may be done at the discretion of the enrolling physician  
and/or  principal  investigator.  All screening  tests  will be paid for by [CONTACT_751539].  
 
Risks  and Benefits  
Some  subjects  may experience  discomforts,  or pain on intravenous  injection  of 
dexrazoxane. We  will minimize  this risk by [CONTACT_751540] #262180

 over 15  (+/-5) minutes. If a participant reports pain during the infusion, the catheter will 
be checked to ensure it is properly inserted.  If no problems are noted with the catheter, 
the  rate of the infusion will be slowed. There is a very low probability that a subject may  
develop  subcutaneous  and cutaneous  necrosis.  Subjects  will be informed  and instructed  
to report to study team if she develops this side effect. PI [INVESTIGATOR_751527]. 
To reduce the risk of bruising and pain from multiple injections, the twelve hourly blood  
draws  will be drawn  from the IV catheter.  If the initial  IV line stops  working  for any reason,  
a new  line will have  to be placed.  
There is a very low probability that a subject may develop myelosuppression. Each  
subject  will have  screening  CBC  one week  after dexrazoxane  infusion  to rule out 
myelosuppression.  The study  team  will arrange  for medical  care and expect  recovery  if a 
subject develops myelosuppression.  If the one -week post -study blood counts are not  
within  normal  range,  subject  will have  additional  CBC  at [ADDRESS_1028844]-infusion.  
The risk of allergic reaction is very low. In a rare situation, if the participant develops  
allergic  reaction to  dexrazoxane,  the infusion  will be stopped.  
Other  adverse  events  may include:  
• Bluish  color  
• changes  in skin color  
• chest  pain or tightness  in the chest  
• chills  
• cold hands  and feet 
• cough,  sneezing,  sore throat  
• difficult  or labored  breathing  
• fever  
• hoarseness  
• lower  back  or side pain 
• pain,  redness,  or swelling  in the arm or leg 
• painful  or difficult  urination  
• swelling  of the hands,  ankles,  feet, or lower  legs 
• tenderness  
• unusual  bleeding  or bruising  
• unusual  tiredness  or weakness)

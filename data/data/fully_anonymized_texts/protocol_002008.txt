Despi[INVESTIGATOR_400439], Veterans  and non -Veterans  with head and neck cancer (HNC) are faced with chronic, 
intractable dysphagia resulting in persistent drastic alterations in diet, the need for feeding 
tubes, and increased risk for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59499] – a life threatening infection. We must 
devote research and clinical efforts to mitigate these devastating impairments because currently 
our rehabilitative intervention options are severely limited. As such, and in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_400440]’s Blueprint for Excellence Transformative Actions, the need for the development of 
effective swallowing interventions that show potential for rapid translation to clinical practice  
is imperative. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow coordination is an essential element of airway protection 
during swallowing and facilitates many key aspects of swallowing physiology. This key 
coordinative event is significantly disrupted in patients who are dysphagic following medical and 
surgical treatments for HNC. Our preliminary trial tested an innovative swallowing treatment 
approach developed in our clinical laboratory, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow training (RST), that targets 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow coordination directly and resulted in compelling improvements in physiologic 
swallowing outcomes in Veterans  and non -Veterans  suffering from dysphagia that persisted 
long after traditional behavioral swallowing intervention(s). The goal of this proposed trial is to 
extend our preliminary study using a rigorous, randomized cross over design and determine the 
impact and durability of RST on  clinical outcomes  essential for eating, drinking, health, and 
quality -of-life in patients  with HNC. As such, positive results from the proposed trial have high 
significance and clinical relevance for patients’  health and well -being.  
 
A total of 51 participants  will be recruited  with the goal of 40 participants enrolled . Participants 
will be  randomly assigned 1:[ADDRESS_504746] ( intervention arm ) or no active treatment ( control 
arm), which is considered standard of care in this patient population. The participants in the 
control arm will have no active treatment for [ADDRESS_504747].  
 
Our overarching goal is to provide two parallel tracks of knowledge generation: 1) provide 
immediate clinical translation of experimental findings to improve the lives of Veterans  and non -
Veterans , and 2) drive model generation on fundamental mechanisms of motor 
coordination.  Basic knowledge will drive clinical application and vice -a-versa.  As such, this is an 
ideal experimental and clinical context that will fuel knowledge generation in this highly 
significant area of science and clinical practice.

2.0 Introduction  
 
Swallowing Impairment in Head and Neck Cancer (HNC).  Veterans are approximately twice as 
likely to incur HNC when compared to the general population and may suffer life -long inability to 
eat, drink, and swallow normally.1-4 It is hypothesized that the increased incidence of cancer in 
veterans may be related to unique risk factors, such as exposure to toxic materials during 
military service, maladaptive behaviors to manage stress (e.g., smoking and alcohol abuse), or 
an increasing number of aging veterans who are more likely to manifest the disease later in 
life.24 Comorbidities of veterans, such as chronic pulmonary disorders, may further complicate 
recovery from cancer treatment.2 
 
In a 26 -year follow -up study of approximately 250,000 [LOCATION_002] (US) Veterans that 
evaluated the risks of cigarette smoking, a strong dose -response effect between smoking and a 
large number of cancer sites was revealed, including the oropharynx.25 Worldwide, 350,000 -
400,000 people are diagnosed with oropharyngeal ( OP) HNC each year – nearly 10% in the US 
alone.[ADDRESS_504758] these new organ 
sparing protocols are potentially less perturbing to swallowing function than surgery followed by 
[CONTACT_54615], toxicity from organ preserving treatments often results in devastating swallowing 
impairments.28-50 Therefore, regardless of the cancer treatment modality, swallowing 
impairments are highly significant and are potentially long -lasting medical and functional 
concerns for HNC patients and the Veterans Health Administration.  
 
Further, unlike many cancer types, the incidence of OP HNC is moving in the wrong direction. 
OP HNC incidence has increased by 1.3% from 2007 to 2011, likely related to increases in 
tumors incited by [CONTACT_61421][INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV -positive).4,[ADDRESS_504759] high propensity to impair swallowing function because the 
tumor site and medical/surgical treatments directed toward cure or local control in the 
oropharyngeal region, include critical structures involved in airway protection and clearance of 
ingested material through the upper aerodigestive tract. Specifically, disruption of the structure 
and function of the base of tongue  reduces its force -generating capacity to clear ingested 
material (bolus) from the oropharynx and its airway protection capacity that normally occurs by

Version 15 Date: 01/24/[ADDRESS_504760] the base of tongue and bolus tail, contributing to incomplete pharyngeal clearance with 
large amounts of pharyngeal residue , and limitations to elevation of the larynx and closure of the 
laryngeal vestibule .10,52,53 Further, sensory end organs involved in the complex coordinative 
process of swallowing initiation and safety, including respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow coordination, may be 
disrupted consequent to toxicities associated with the common treatments for HNC. Relevant to 
the current proposal, the mechanisms of swallowing impairment described herein are precisely 
those that were shown to improve when applying our respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow training (RST) – the 
intervention focus in the current proposal.[ADDRESS_504761] been 
reported to be as high as 66% for OP HNC, and HPV -positive HNC survivors have a 54% better 
overall survival compared to those with HPV -negative tumors.3,54,55 These promising increased 
survival rates are in part related to improved surgical and nonsurgical options for cure, and yet 
the degree of toxicity associated with these treatments options is often high and leads to 
immediate and/or delayed profound inability to swallow. These swallow impairments remain 
chronic, are often resistant to traditional swallowing therapy, and have devastating effects on 
health and well -being. Increased survival with poor health and quality -of-life associated to HNC -
related dysphagia speaks to the need for focused attention on the development of innovative 
and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_400448] -Veteran 
survivors. Cancer survivorship has been described as traumatic, increasing an already  high 
risk of emotional and psychological distress in the Veteran population. This likely 
contributes to the refractory nature of dysphagia following treatment, especially for those with 
continued tobacco and alcohol use and chronic symptoms.[ADDRESS_504762] on improving the 
physiologic mechanisms that are fundamental for safe and efficient swallowing. Based on our 
previous work and exciting preliminary results, we propose that persistent swallowing 
impairment may not only  be related to disordered physiological processes within the 
oropharyngeal system, but also to the coordination of the swallow with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].8,62 The 
nature of the swallowing impairment may predispose patients to disruptions in the otherwise 
highly stable phase relationship in respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow coupling observed in normal, non -
dysphagic individuals.9 
 
Collectively, these data speak to the high significance of this proposal – a natural progression of 
our previous work – designed to further test a novel swallowing intervention that not only 
improves key elements of swallowing physiology, but also has shown potential for functional 
recovery. Our goal is to expand on the rigor of our preliminary trial and includes a 
randomized controlled clinical trial with cross -over that provide patients with a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow recalibration strategy to minimize the coordinative demands 
between breathing and swallowing and optimize airway protection and swallowing 
mechanics . As such, the current application matches well the objectives of the VA Merit 
funding mechanism by [CONTACT_400560] a new therapy that shows high

Version 15 Date: 01/24/2023 promise to benefit a vastly underserved, Veteran  and civilian  population with chronic dysphagia . 
If clinical efficacy is determined, the intervention program will be easily disseminated to the VA 
clinical community and beyond through open access publications, and face -to-face and online 
web training instruction. Lastly, the current initiative will provide detailed information regarding 
the physiologic characteristics, i.e. , “active ingredients” of changes in swallowing impairment 
throughout the intervention using innovative and well -tested, reproducible  measurement 
approaches. Our eventual goal is to use this information to combine our RST protocol with other 
evidence -based interventions to target underlying swallowing impairments and optimize clinical 
outcomes in patients with dysphagia in both the late and acute phases of recovery.  
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -Swallow Coordination.  A substantial body of literature, including work from our labs, 
using a variety of measurement techniques including respi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], chest wall movements, 
and motion imaging of the upper aerodigestive tract has shown that there is a highly stable, 
coordinative relationship between respi[INVESTIGATOR_400449].4,12,15,16,53,[ADDRESS_504763] frequently during a pause 
(respi[INVESTIGATOR_400450]) in the expi[INVESTIGATOR_400451], 
quiet breathing expi[INVESTIGATOR_324976].4,12,15,16,52,[ADDRESS_504764] protection and secondly, it 
facilitates key, advantageous swallowing mechanical functions, such as laryngeal elevation and 
closure, pharyngeal shortening and pressure generation with consequent bolus clearance, and 
pharyngoesophageal segment (PES) opening.12,15,52,[ADDRESS_504765] timing of this pause or obligatory inhibition (sometimes referred 
to as deglutition apnea) differs slightly for liquid swallows, most likely due to differences in 
experimental procedures (e.g., differences in delivery of the bolus into the oral cavity for 
swallowing), measurement devices (e.g., nasal flow vs. chest wall measurements) and analysis 
procedures (e.g., looking at flow events vs. categorizing respi[INVESTIGATOR_400452]). 62-66,68 -
71,75 Swallowing at mid -to-low expi[INVESTIGATOR_400453] ( optimal phase pattern ), provides important mechanical advantages. The 
diaphragm continues to be active during the early expi[INVESTIGATOR_400454]. At mid -to-low 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_400455], the diaphragm is relaxed and traction on the trachea is minimal.15,78,[ADDRESS_504766] of various medical conditions on this 
synergy is far from complete. Non-optimal respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase patterning  (swallowing at 
high lung volume during the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_62398]) has been found in HNC patients with dysphagia 
and in several neurologic conditions both in the absence and presence of significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_23697].9 Particularly relevant to the present study are our previous findings that partial surgical 
ablation of the oropharynx and/or various combinations of radiation and chemotherapy 
negatively impacted normal respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase stability.9 This may be due to: 1) 
impairments within the oropharyngeal swallowing system, such as delayed pharyngeal swallow 
due to sensory loss, incomplete tongue base retraction , and impaired shortening and elevation 
of the larynx and pharynx  leading to incomplete laryngeal vestibular closure  and opening of the 
PES9 – all of which may impact coordination with breathing; 2) impairments within the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_400456]; and/or 3) disruptions in the

Version 15 Date: 01/24/2023 coordination of breathing and swallowing that exceed these systems and are related to neural 
control impairments. This creates, therefore, the important theoretical context for the necessity 
of examining both “within” and “across” swallow system impairment.[ADDRESS_504767] recalibrates the “sensory percept 
(perceived lung volume) specific to the domain of perturbation” (airway protection and 
pharyngeal clearance during swallowing performance).[ADDRESS_504768] of cross -system respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow impairments on “within” swallowing system 
impairment (Figure 1). Further, we are ideally positioned to test interventions that minimize the 
impact of cross -system impairment on swallowing function (disordered physiology and 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) in our target population –Veterans and non -Veterans with chronic dysphagia treated 
for HNC.  
 
 
PRELIMINARY STUDIES  
 
Specific Aim 1. Understanding normal versus disordered aspects of swallowing, including 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow coordinative processes, has been the focus of the principal and affiliated 
investigator’s research for over 20 years. Additionally, the principal investigator (BMH) has 
extensive clinical experience and expertise in swallowing impairments consequent to HNC. Our 
team’s expertise, experiences and laboratories provide the ideal scientific and clinical 
background for the proposed clinical study that is a natural progression of our previous 
successful trial.[ADDRESS_504769] of this work as it relates to the rationale 
for the methodology proposed in the current study.  
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -Swallow Coordination and Phasing – Healthy, Adults  without Dysphagia . Work 
unique to the laboratories of the current investigators has led to the development of a normative 
model of temporally integrated breathing and swallowing patterns using simultaneous 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_400457] -linked to videonasoendoscopic and videofluoroscopic 
imaging of oropharyngeal swallowing.12,52,62,68,78,83 These simultaneous recordings permit timing 
measures of a variety of key swallowing events, such as lingual and hyolaryngeal motion, 
laryngeal vestibular closure, tongue base retraction, pharyngeal contraction, and extent and 
duration of PES opening as they  occur at various points along the respi[INVESTIGATOR_21273] (Figure 2).  
The broad objective of this line of research has been to establish normative temporal and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_400458], adult 
humans across the aging continuum.  The significance of this work is deviations from normal

and bolus clearing mechanical swallowing events.  
 
Our early work (and that of others) has provided a clear description of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow 
coordination in normal, healthy individuals.11,15,16,52,[ADDRESS_504772] frequently and consistently preceded and followed 
by [CONTACT_46761][INVESTIGATOR_400459]. This “optimal” phase  pattern has been termed expi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -expi[INVESTIGATOR_696] ( E-E) 
to describe the respi[INVESTIGATOR_400460] (Figure 3), which represented 75% of 
the observed respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase relationships in one of our previous study of 76 healthy 
adults across the age spectrum.8,52,77 This pattern was followed in frequency of occurrence 
when swallowing was immediately preceded by [CONTACT_82917][INVESTIGATOR_400461] ( I-E) flow 
(20%). The two least frequently occurring patterns were when swallowing was preceded by 
[CONTACT_46761][INVESTIGATOR_400462]  (E-I) (4%) , and when swallowing 
interrupted inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (I-I) (1%).  None of the healthy individuals in the few cases of the 
non-optimal pattern demonstrated swallowing impairment or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. However, swallows 
immediately preceded or followed by [CONTACT_82917][INVESTIGATOR_10229] ( E-I, I-E, I-I) could potentially expose the 
passing bolus during the swallow or residual bolus after the swallow to negative, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_400463], thus increasing risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_400464] -healthy  
populations with swallowing disorders .

Version 15 Date: 01/24/[ADDRESS_504774]. It has been shown that the manipulation of

Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -Swallow Coordination and Swallowing Impairment – Patients Treated for OP HNC.  
Against this backdrop and based on our extensive research and clinical experience with the 
target patient population, we had reason to believe that respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow coordination as 
described above is impaired and should be considered an appropriate target of clinical 
intervention. Patients who had been treated for OP HNC presented with non -optimal and 
potentially hazardous and inefficient respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow coordinative patterns that contributed 
to their overall swallowing impairment. Our first preliminary investigation in patients treated for 
HNC investigated whether non -optimal respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase patterning was present and if 
so, what are the implications for swallowing impairment. The early investigation was the first to 
examine the potential relationship between “within system” swallowing impairments (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_400472] -Swallow Training on Refractory Dysphagia in OP HNC  Funding 
(1010498 -19)

Version 15 Date: 01/24/2023 and impairment in swallowing physiology) and “cross -system” alterations, such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -
swallow phasing.[ADDRESS_504777] -cancer treatment and traditional swallowing intervention were compared to 20 
healthy, age -matched controls. Nine of the cancer patients were treated with surgical resection 
followed by [CONTACT_400561] (SURG -XRT), and 11 were treated with combined chemotherapy 
and radiation treatment (CHEMO -XRT).  
 
As presented in Table 1, our preliminary data [from an early study that in part motivated our first 
training trial, revealed that only 35% of cancer patients (n = 7) used the optimal pattern ( E-E) 
(65% used non -optimal) during single liquid swallows as compared to 75% (n = 15) of the 
normal controls (p = .04). The cancer patients used E-I (n = 3) and I-E (n = 10). None of the 
cancer patients in this sample produced the I-I pattern.  
 
We also explored the relationship between respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase pattern and Penetration -
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_127353] (PAS) scores. Of the 13 OP HNC patients (65%) presenting with the non -
optimal phase patterns, 30% (n = 4) demonstrated varying degrees of penetration (PAS = 3 -5) 
and 30% (n = 4) aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831] (PAS = 6 -8). Patients with non -optimal phase patterns had 
statistically significantly greater (worse) PAS scores than patients with optimal phase patterns (p 
= 0.004). There were no differences between cancer treatment groups. Given the occurrence of 
non-optimal phase patterning and the higher PAS scores in these patients, we hypothesize that 
OP HNC patients may be swallowing at less than ideal and potentially hazardous moments in 
the respi[INVESTIGATOR_400473], or at least a subgroup of these patients, at increased 
risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_400474].9 Further, the patients with non -optimal 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase patterning also demonstrated higher (worse) scores relative to 
swallowing physiology. Patients with inconsistent phase patterns (some optimal, some non -
optimal) across trials had significantly higher (worse) physiologic impairment indicated by [CONTACT_400562] (MBSImP ™) scores when compared to patients 
who produced consistent phase pattern across trials (T1: F = 3.597, p = 0.039; T2: F = 3.427, p 
= 0.045). The findings from this preliminary data set indicate that not only does the phase 
pattern play a role in the severity of swallowing dysfunction, but the consistency or stability of 
phase pattern may also impact severity of swallowing impairment. These preliminary data lead 
us to consider that respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phasing issues are important factors underlying chronic 
swallowing impairments and the presence of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_400475].  
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -Swallow Training Intervention: Preliminary Trial.  In contrast to previous intervention 
approaches to swallowing rehabilitation, we designed a trial that targeted the coordinative 
relationships between respi[INVESTIGATOR_400476] a recalibration approach that 
included visuallydirected, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow feedback. We minimized the coordinative 
requirements and trained consistent and optimal respi[INVESTIGATOR_400477].  
 
Our primary aims were three -fold: 1) use a novel, well -established hierarchy of motor skill 
acquisition,62-64and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -related feedback protocol to train optimal respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow 
coordinative phase patterns;63-65 2) determine the effect(s) of training on respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow Table 1  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow patterns during single liquid swallow in OP HNC patients.

Version 15 Date: 01/24/2023 phasing and physiologic swallowing measures; and 3) test the stability of the training effect one -
month post -intervention. We hypothesized that more optimal respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow coordination 
could be learned, sustained, and have a beneficial impact on swallowing function in chronically 
dysphagic patients treated for HNC. Our current goal is to provide a context through RST that 
goes beyond improvements in swallow physiology alone and extends the clinical impact to 
achievement of increases in food and liquid options with minimized risk of  laryngeal  penetration 
and/or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
 
Using visual feedback similar to our previous study, patients in our previous study were trained 
to initiate swallows during the expi[INVESTIGATOR_400479] -low lung volume 
and to continue to expi[INVESTIGATOR_400480]. Patients were instructed to not use any other 
previous swallowing maneuvers or compensations, nor did they demonstrate implementation of 
such. Patient implementation of the optimal phase patterning increased significantly after the 
RST intervention ( p <0.0001) regardless of bolus viscosity (Table 2) . That is, all patients learned 
to recalibrate their respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phasing and produced the optimal pattern (E -E). 
 
Specific Aim 2. Physiologic changes to the swallowing mechanism were demonstrated using 
one metric approach (MBSImP) in our preliminary study. The investigators explored the 
physiologic changes expected to occur following RST using innovative analysis methods that 
clarified the nature of these changes.  
 
Computational Analysis of Swallowing Mechanics (CASM)  is a multivariate morphometric 
analysis of coordinates mappi[INVESTIGATOR_400481] (MBSS) imaging. As muscle groups underlie changes in coordinates, so then 
shape change characterizes swallowing mechanics (Figure 4).22,[ADDRESS_504778] -intervention  p-value

data analysis, D = 0.80, p <0.0001). Regression analysis indicated that pharyngeal swallowing 
mechanics associated with RST was predictive of mechanics associated with laryngeal 
vestibular closure in the aggregate (R2 = 0.25, p <0.0001), whereas pharyngeal swallowing 
mechanics associated with bolus changes from a large thin liquid bolus to a small thick bolus 
(pudding) was less predictive of mechanics associated with laryngeal vestibular closure in the 
aggregate (R2 = 0.07, p <0.0001). Based on the demonstrated feasibility and outcome when 
using the morphometric analysis in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], this approach will be a primary method to 
detail physiologic change associated with RST . 
 
The Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile© (MBSImP ™). The MBSImP, which has been 
developed and tested over the past 10 years, is a valid and reliable standardized approach for 
the training and measurement of swallowing physiology, data collection, data analysis, and 
reporting results from a MBSS.13,14,19 The objectives of the approach, including clinical validation 
of the physiologic metrics, achievement of inter -rater reliability, practicality in execution of the 
protocol and scoring, and linking to clinical action (intervention planning), have been translated 
to clinical practice throughout the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia.[ADDRESS_504781] in our 
preliminary study. Achievement of optimal respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase pattern was found to be 
associated with improvements in three MBSImP component scores: laryngeal vestibular closure 
(p = 0.0004), tongue base retraction (p <0.0001), and pharyngeal residue (p = 0.01). Significant 
improvements were also seen in PAS scores (p <0.0001). Relative to pre -intervention values, 
patients participating in one -month follow -up had: increased optimal phase patterning (p 
<0.0001); improved laryngeal vestibular closure (p = 0.01), tongue base retraction (p = 0.003), 
and pharyngeal residue (p = 0.006) MBSImP scores; and improved PAS scores (p <0.0001). 
These results led us to conclude that improvements in respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase patterns can 
be trained using a systematic training protocol, and the respi[INVESTIGATOR_62398] -lung volume related 
visual feedback approach has favorable effects on airway protection and bolus clearance in 
patients with chronic dysphagia following HNC treatment.

3.0 Objectives  
 
Our previous trial in patients with severe and resistant dysphagia after cancer treatment and 
traditional swallowing therapy showed that targeting and recalibrating respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase 
patterning directly through an innovative respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow training (RST) method significantly 
improved aspects of swallowing physiology  crucial for airway protection and clearance of 
ingested materials through the pharynx.8,16 As with our preliminary trial, our prediction is that 
these innovative intervention methods will not only improve swallowing physiology and quality -
of-life but  will also result in significant functional improvements in every day eating and drinking 
in Veterans  and non -Veterans  with chronic, severe dysphagia that has been otherwise 
refractory to traditional swallowing intervention(s). The benefit of RST training is that it is a 
simple, straightforward method for patients to easily learn . . We are also using commercially 
available and simple to use recording and analysis hardware and software that can easily be 
expanded to mobile technology for more widespread application to the many thousands of 
patients with dysphagia consequent to HNC.  
 
The goal of this current study is to extend our preliminary trial that yielded compelling 
physiologic changes with potential to improve the impact and durability of RST on  clinical 
outcomes  essential for eating, drinking, health, and quality -of-life.  
 
Specific Aim 1.  Directly train optimal respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase patterning using RST and test 
the clinical efficacy and durability of the effect measured by [CONTACT_400556]. Hypothesis:  RST will improve oral intake status and liquid/food texture 
tolerances. Primary Outcome: Physiologic metrics of the oropharyngeal swallow as measured 
by [CONTACT_400557] (MBSImP) scores,13,14,19; Secondary 
Outcome:  Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS).17,[ADDRESS_504788]

Patient Sample . A total  of 51 participants  will be  enrolled with the goal of 40 recruited if they  
meet inclusion criteria. Forty  participants  will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either RST 
(intervention arm ) or no active treatment ( control arm ), which is considered standard of care in 
this patient population. Participants assigned to the control arm will cross -over after [ADDRESS_504791] respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase 
patterning by [CONTACT_400564][INVESTIGATOR_400487], 
assess swallowing physiology  (MBSImP) and assess clinical swallowing status (FOIS). 
Participants  will be included in the study if they are able to swallow at least one liquid 
consistency without visible tracheal residue (PAS ≤6) and without the use of a compensatory 
strategy or swallow maneuver. Participants  will be excluded if they have known allergy or 
dietary restriction for contrast materials or liquids used during the MBSS or training, currently 
drinking greater than two drinks per day, severe COPD, are unable to swallow one liquid 
consistency without the use of a compensatory strategy or swallow maneuver without 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], or history of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_400488] 12 months.   
 
Clinician Examiners, Raters and Trainers.  Expert speech -language pathologists (SLPs) w ill 
participate in this study to  provide RST training, conduct the MBSSs, and perform blinded

tasks via presentations of varying bolus consistencies, bolus volumes, and presentation 
methods. However, consistent with the MBSImP protocol, if a patient is unable to tolerate a 
swallow task because of safety (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) concerns, that task is not included,  and the 
component scores associated with the missing task are given the worst (highest) score in

dysfunction and quality of life in patients with HNC.131 Three subscales, (Normalcy of diet, Public 
Eating and Speech Intelligibility) each with 100 point rating scales and arranged in a 
hierarchically order from total incapacitation to normal functioning, are used to evaluate relevant 
parameters of functional status specifically for the HNC patient.  
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -Swallow Training (RST). We will encourage optimal respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase 
pattern in Veteran  and non -Veteran participants  using a protocol well supported by [CONTACT_400566].100-[ADDRESS_504800] 
at the Hines VA or Northwestern University . 
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_400497].  During the feedback portions of the 
training and using each participant’s  lung volume signals as described above, we will track and 
signal the appropriate moment of swallowing initiation using cycle detection and threshold 
algorithms programmed within AcqKnowledge software – an interactive software that allows for 
complex data acquisition, including simulation of model respi[INVESTIGATOR_400498], respi[INVESTIGATOR_400499].[ADDRESS_504801] two minutes of stable quiet breathing in the absence of experimental manipulation or other 
instrumentation. A peak detection algorithm steps through the respi[INVESTIGATOR_400498] (the 
cyclical changes in lung volume provided by [CONTACT_400567]) to 
find positive and negative peaks in a cycle and, from this, determines an average lung volume 
excursion from peak inspi[INVESTIGATOR_400500]’s quiet breathing lung volume 
change. From this, a threshold will be automatically determined as 50% of the expi[INVESTIGATOR_400501]. During the training sessions in real time, the threshold detection algorithm will 
detect positive peaks in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_400502] a visual and auditory feedback signal when 50% of the 
negative going lung volume change (expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) has been reached. In this way, participants  will 
be cued to produce their swallows beginning in the optimal range of lung volumes. These 
customizable programs to each participant’s  quiet breathing waveforms will track performance 
during RST. In this way, we can evaluate the achievement of criteria and performance for each 
of our training modules. In the RST modules, a visual and audio signal will be provided when 
the participant’s  tracked lung volume is within the optimal range and this feedback will 
eventually be removed as they move to the mastery module of training. A contact [CONTACT_130769] 
(BIPOAC Systems, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA, Model TSD108) will be connected to the MP150 
(in-clinic) units. The microphone signal will be used as a reliable indicator of the presence of 
swallows. The percentage of trials that each participant  swallows within the target mid -to-low

AcqKnowledge  software used during in -clinic RST is accessible via the desktop upon logging in 
to the computer. Templates are pre -programmed and once opened, the software only requires 
the participant  to select the appropriate template and click “start” for data collection to begin. In 
addition to remote assistance by [CONTACT_400568] -language pathologist (SLP), written and 
video, step -by-step tutorials will be provided to the participant  for at home set -up, calibration,

identification, acquisition (performance), and mastery (Figure 5). For  each goal within the 
identification and acquisition modules, a minimum of 8 of 10 trials will be required for the goal to 
be met. A minimum of 9 of 10 trials will be required during the mastery module. If the participant  
does not meet the goal, reinstruction will be provided. Liquids will be standardized for all 
patients, but participants  will be trained only on liquid consistencies with PAS scores  ≤[ADDRESS_504804] MBSS.   
 
During the Identification Module, samples from recordings of each participant’s  quite breathing

on previous clinical trial that demonstrated an average of six RST sessions to reach mastery.[ADDRESS_504806] of Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -Swallow Training on Refractory Dysphagia in OP HNC  Funding

During the in -clinic RST training sessions, the computer videorecorder will be taking front -facing 
video of each patient’s training sessions. These recordings will be compared to the physiologic 
signals received via the BIOPAC to better understand/learn/become informed about how the 
patients learn during intervention training sessions. These recordings will also be used for 
teaching purposes for study staff.   
At the completion of RST, the participants will be asked to complete the NASA Workload Index, 
a 7-point scale which estimates the participant’s perceived effort in completing the training.  
 
Data Management, Analysis, and Reporting System Overview.  Study related data are 
stored on VA approved computers and the VA research shared drive (S:), including de -identified 
study -related data (videofluoroscopic images, respi[INVESTIGATOR_400509]). Identifiable data (VAS A), 
including demographic data, questionnaire responses, and treatment results are stored on the 
VA R EDCap behind the VA firewall. De-identified videofluoroscopic images and respi[INVESTIGATOR_400510]’s lab at Northwestern University, and then stored on 
and analyzed from a password protected, dedicated server. This server is managed by 
[CONTACT_400569]. We will 
update the data transfer and storage operations as we are provided additional guidance and 
requirements from the ORO, Office of Research Oversight.  
 
Power and Sample Size Justification.  A total of 40 subjects will be randomized 1:1 using 
stratified block randomization to either Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -Swallow Training (RST, intervention arm) or 
no control arm, where the participants serve as their own control and then cross over into the 
intervention group . Strata will be defined by [CONTACT_173502]. Data obtained will be used to 
evaluate clinical efficacy and durability. The primary outcome measure will be MBSImP 
physiologic function metrics of the oropharyngeal swallow. Our previous preliminary trial that 
tested the safety and efficacy of the behavioral swallowing intervention in a small sample of 
Veteran and non -Veteran patient with head and neck cancer showed a positive change in the 
physiologic outcomes. Assuming a similar treatment effect in the current trial, 20 patients in 
each arm provides 95% power to detect a change in MBSImP physiologic function in at least 
one of three MBSImP components (laryngeal vestibular closure, tongue base retraction, and 
pharyngeal residue) based on a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test with two -sided α = 0.025. 
Although dropouts have been rare in our prior studies, we nonetheless inflated our sample size 
by 10% to adjust for unanticipated attrition, and plan to recruit [ADDRESS_504808] 80% power.  Thus, our final sample size will be 
a total of [ADDRESS_504809] session will contribute to the intent -to-treat (ITT) population. Participants  in the control arm 
who withdraw consent prior to visit 1 will be replaced. All others in the control arm will contribute 
to the ITT population. The per -protocol population will be composed of participants  who 
complete both visit 0 and visit 1 evaluations (both arms), and who complete all required training 
sessions (intervention arm). Efficacy will be evaluated based on the ITT population. Participants 
in the ITT population who withdraw prior to endpoint evaluation at 6 -weeks will be treated as 
failures (no improvement) in the ITT analysis. The safety population is defined as all participants

Specific Aim 2 Design and Methods – Intervention Impact of RST on Swallowing 
Physiology. We will elaborate the treatment impact of RST by [CONTACT_400570], 
airway protective and morphometric changes that occur from the intervention. We will use 
MBSImP, PAS (described for Aim 1), and CASM.  
 
MBSImP Scores.  The MBSImP scores will provide a primary outcome measure of swallowing 
impairment. The MBSImP is a validated and reliable scoring system for the quantification of 
swallowing impairment from MBSS recordings.13,14,[ADDRESS_504810] 
impaired. The scale for components ranges from 0 -2 to 0 -4 for each physiologic component.14 
Years of field testing shows scores of 0 or 1 for the physiologic components of lip closure, oral 
residue, pharyngeal residue, and tongue base retraction are considered to be within normal 
limits.112 For all other components, scores greater than 0 represent some level of impairment.  
Two methods will be used for MBSImP scoring: swallow -by-swallow (SS) and overall impression 
(OI). SS scoring assigns an MBSImP score for all applicable physiologic components for each 
of the [ADDRESS_504811] (worst) score will be given during SS scoring when the participant’s  
condition or performance on a previous swallowing task results in the withholding of a 
subsequent swallowing task for safety concerns.9,52 Additionally, missing data in SS 
interpretation will result if a participant  refuses a swallowing task.52 As such, we will only include 
scores for swallowing tasks that are actually presented.  
 
Computational Analysis of Swallowing Mechanics ( CASM).  Annotators who meet reliability 
criterion109 will use a MATLAB (version R2015a, 8.5.0.197613, 64 -bit) semi -automated tracker 
tool designed specifically for coordinate mappi[INVESTIGATOR_400511].113,[ADDRESS_504812] (Co -Investigator, WP), coordinates for all swallows are concatenated and a 
second file of variables that match unique identifiers is compi[INVESTIGATOR_400512] (pre -
intervention vs. post -intervention), swallowing domain (oral vs. pharyngeal), bolus volume (large 
[cup] vs. small [5ml]), bolus viscosity (thin vs. thick), sex (male vs. female), penetration -
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_400513] (within functional limits [PAS = 1 ,2] vs. penetration -aspi[INVESTIGATOR_400514] = 3 -8]), and 
MBSImP component scores. These files are uploaded into MorphoJ integrated software for 
analysis.115 
 
Statistical Considerations.  The primary endpoints for Specific Aim 2 are MBSImP scores, PAS 
scores, and morphometric canonical variate scores for participants  enrolled in the clinical trial 
(Specific Aim 1). MBSImP component scores and PAS will be dichotomized as impaired versus 
not-impaired as previously described.8 [Analyses of impairment rates, MBSImP composite (oral 
and pharyngeal total) scores, and time course data will be conducted using ANACOVA, GEEs

Version 15 Date: 01/24/2023 and Rao -Scott Chi -square tests as described in Specific Aim 1. To evaluate rater reliability for 
MBSImP and PAS measures, 20% of MBSSs will be re -scored by [CONTACT_157570]. Intra -class 
correlations coefficients will be calculated to measure inte r- and intra -rater reliability.  
 
CASM  will be applied to pre - and post -RST MBSSs to determine and visualize improvements in 
covariant swallowing mechanics resulting from RST and  determine which of these treatments is 
predictive of swallowing improvement as measured by [CONTACT_400571]. Following a 
Procrustes fit of coordinates to control for differences in size and image rotation, a canonical 
variate analysis with post hoc discriminant function analyses21,[ADDRESS_504813] and use of dedicated fluoroscopy 
equipment are likely to minimize radiation exposure. The radiation of a swallow study is 
approximately 40 mrem of radiation for approximately 5 minutes of exposure, which is 0.8% of 
the annual maximum amount permitted by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for 
radioactive drug research.[ADDRESS_504814]. Martin -Harris’ lab demonstrated the 
standardized MBSImP protocol increases efficiency and speed for MBSS completion.125 It takes 
an average of 2.89 minutes of fluoroscopy exposure (95% confidence interval (CI) of 2.80 to 
2.97 minutes), which is well under the reported 3 -5 minutes encountered in an upper 
gastrointestinal series.125 Interpolating from the relationship Moro et al. (2006) published, the 
mean of [ADDRESS_504815] known dysphagia, there is a risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_400515].127 If the barium is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831], it is not expected to cause severe lung 
injury due to its relatively non -irritant matter. However, acute inflammation, and even death, has 
been reported, despi[INVESTIGATOR_400516] -density preparations of 
barium. Participation in this investigation will not increase the risk  of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. If a swallowing 
impairment is observed during the examination, a referral to the participant’s  attending physician 
will be made.   
 
The risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_400517]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_400518], our collaborative speech pathology and medical teams plan to 
institute measures that optimize the participant’s  safety. These include: 1) inclusion of

Version 15 Date: 01/24/[ADDRESS_504816] 12 months; and 2) liquid 
consistencies that result in PAS scores of ≥[ADDRESS_504817] trial that showed no 
adverse events, participants  will be encouraged to swallow naturally without employing any 
previously instructed maneuvers or strategies. If the participant  cannot swallow without a 
maneuver or strategy and meet inclusion criteria, he/she will be excluded from the study.     
  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_400519].  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_400520] (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.) data.128 There are no known 
risks associated with the placement of loose elastic bands (Inductobands, Ambulatory 
Monitoring, Inc.)128 around participants’ chests and abdomens while data are collected on a data 
acquisition system (BIPOAC Systems, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA, Model MP150) . There is the 
unlikely potential, though inconsistent with our preliminary observations, that manipulation of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_400521]’s  swallowing worse, either 
during the intervention or the post -intervention MBSS. If there is any clinical indication that the 
participant  is experiencing coughing or discomfort with the task, the task will be discontinued,  
and the participant  will be excluded from further treatment. No alternative procedures or 
treatments are available.  
 
Patient Perceived Effort  Associated with Training . All patients will be asked to complete the 
NASA Task Load Index survey . This survey contains 6 task load domains and asks the 
participant  to indicate the mental, physical and temporal demand, performance success, effort 
and frustrations levels associated with the training using a visual analog rating scale.  
 
Adequacy of Protection from Risk  
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent  
 
Designated approved study personn el will obtain informed consent, including PI, Study 
Coordinator, Research SLP (speech -language pathology), and clinical SLPs.  All potential 
participants  (volunteers ) will be explained the study procedures, potential risks and benefits by 
[CONTACT_400572]. All eligible participants , regardless of race, ethnic origin, or sex, 
will be asked to participate as long as authorization and informed consent can be obtained. Any 
participant  may withdraw from the study at any time without penalty or prejudice for treatment.   
 
Protection against Risk  
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent.  Potential participant  volunteers will be identified by [CONTACT_400573], all approved by [CONTACT_400574] 
(IRB): 1) follow -up medical visits, such as  the otolaryngology -head and neck clinics  at the Hines 
VAMC , Loyola University Medical Center ; 2) announcement of the study in the VA patient 
bulletins and monitors; 3) community based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) ; 4) review of patient 
medical char ts (CPRS)  at HVA  to find patients that match the diagnosis of oropharyngeal 
cancer and dysphagia diagnoses  and mailing informational letters to these potential patients ; 
and 5) posting of recruitment flyers at Jesse Brown VA , Loyola University Medical Center ,

All potential eligible participant  will sign a study consent form approved by [CONTACT_41309]’s IRB. The 
potential risks as described above will be clearly stated on the informed consent and during the 
consenting process (see above in Potential Risks). Veterans  and non -Veterans  who express 
interest in participating will be explained the study protocol, presented with a consent form to 
sign and date, and be given an opportunity to have any questions regarding the procedure or 
the research study addressed and answered to their satisfaction. Additionally, non -Veteran 
participants will sign a Notice of Privacy Practices (N oPP) form which will be sent to the 
appropriate privacy officer.  
 
The study investigators will not treat the socially/ economically disadvantaged  participant  
volunteers differently from other participants in the study. This includes all study personnel 
ensuring there are no coercive behaviors undertaken during the study period. For this study, 
study personnel will not be obtaining data regarding the veterans’ social and/or economic 
status. Therefore, study -related complications are not anticipated,  and all participants  will be 
treated identically and equally.  
 
Radiation.  This research study involves exposure to a small amount of radiation. As part of 
everyday living, everyone is exposed to naturally occurring background radiation and receives a 
dose of about 3.0 mSv each year.125 The effective does from this study is about 0.44 mSv, 
which is estimated from a 3 -minute exposure during a videofluoroscopic study.125 This is equal 
to the average radiation all Americans receive in two months from natural background radiation, 
such as naturally occurring radioactivity in the soil.126 Any risk from this small amount of 
radiation is too small to be measured directly and is small when compared to other every day 
risks.  
 
Care should be taken to reduce the influence of all possible factors not related to improved 
diagnostic yield according to the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle.[ADDRESS_504818] of such a reduction in dose. The amount of radiation each 
participant  will be exposed to is relatively small since the X -ray machine is only turned on while 
he/she swallows. Although such doses of radiation may be potentially harmful, the risks are so 
small that they are difficult to measure. The potential long -term risk from the radiation doses is 
uncertain, but the risk to each participant  is estimated to be slight. The barium that allows the 
liquid and food to show up on X -ray is not harmful and will stay in the body only for a relatively 
short period of time.  
 
Examining SLPs will wear lead -lined, radiation shielding aprons around their chest and torso. 
SLPs will also wear lead -lined thyroid shields. A radiation dosimeter will also be worn to 
measure exposure levels that are monitored by [CONTACT_68811]. A lead apron skirt will be provided to 
each participant to protect his/her reproductive organs from radiation scatter.  
  
Female participants will not be allowed to participate if they are pregnant or if there is any 
possibility of being pregnant.  
 
Based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria described above, potential Veteran  and non -Veteran  
volunteers will be asked to participate in the study only after informed consent is obtained.

Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics  
 
A total of 51 Veteran  and non -Veteran  volunteers will be recruited.  
 
Inclusion of Women, Minorities and/or Children.  No participants  will be excluded based on sex 
or race/ethnic origin.  Sex, ethnic, and racial information will be collected as part of the 
demographic information. Participants will be selected based on the inclusion criteria identified 
above.  
 
Ethnicity (i.e., Hispanic/Latino, Non -Hispanic/Latino) will be recorded separately from race. All 
applicable racial categories (i.e., American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or 
other Pacific Islander, Black/African American, White) will be recorded for each participant  by 
[CONTACT_3462]. All ethnic and racial totals will be reported, including specific categories for 
those participants  who report mixed racial descent (any combinations recorded by [CONTACT_25617]). No outreach program to recruit minorities is planned because all  eligible  individuals, 
regardless of race or ethnic origin, will be invited to participate. Historic data indicates men are 
twice as likely to have OP HNC compared to women.4 Recent studies from three countries 
([LOCATION_002], [LOCATION_008], and Romania) suggest there is a 2:1 ratio of males to females 
diagnosed with HNC and make up 80% Caucasian, 11% Black/African American, 4% Hispanic, 
and 5% other racial/ethnic categories.122-124 It is anticipated that the sex, ethnic and racial mix of 
this study sample will roughly parallel these demographic data.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.  Entry inclusion criteria:  1) ≥21 years of ag e; 2) signed 
informed consent; 3) at least [ADDRESS_504824] head and neck cancer treatment  for oral cancer, 
oropharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, or hypopharyngeal cancer ; 4) consumes 2 alcoholic 
drinks daily and 5) English speaking. Entry exclusion criteria:  1) known allergy or dietary 
restriction for materials used during the exam; 2) severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD); and 3) recent history of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59499] (past 12 months). Intervention 
inclusion criteria:  1) pass Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (≥26)87. Intervention 
exclusion criteria : 1) fails MoCA (<26); and 2) inability to tolerate at least one liquid 
consistency (PAS ≥7).  Women of child -bearing age will be screened via questionnaire in 
accordance with VA Medical Center policy precautions. Women who are pregnant will be 
excluded from this trial given that five MBSSs are required and the risk of any radiation to the 
fetus exceeds the potential benefit of this study. Men will also be counseled regarding the risks 
of radiation exposure to their reproductive organs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_400522]. Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_400578] -language 
pathologist (SLP). The study procedures, potential risks, and benefits will be explained to all 
participants, and caregivers when appropriate, by [CONTACT_400579]. It will be explained that 
participation in the study will not have any impact on the quality of his/her present and/or future 
care as a patient. Further, if a participant  chooses not to participate or drops out of the study at 
any time, there will be no consequences of this action. There will be no additional study sites 
involved with this research.  
 
Cognitive Criteria.  There exists the possibility that study volunteers may experience co -existing 
cognitive problems that preclude the learning of a new motor task. Participants  will be screened 
immediately following consent (prior to the baseline modified barium swallow study, MBSS) for 
cognitive impairment using the MoCA87 – a cognitive screening test designed to assist health 
professionals for detection of mild cognitive impairment. The standardized procedure covers the 
following cognitive domains: visuospatial/executive, naming, memory, attention, language, 
abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation. Scores for each domain are summed and a total 
score is obtained that can be adjusted for educational level. MoCA scores <[ADDRESS_504825] of Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -Swallow Training on Refractory Dysphagia in OP HNC  Funding

5.5      Study Evaluations  
 
All potential participants will be screened for eligibilty as described above for inclusion/exclusion 
criteria  using medical charts and collection of general history information related to cancer 
diagnosis, treatment, dysphagia treatment, and current swallowing problems . Once deemed 
eligible, the participants will then undergo evaluation to determine eligibility for RST that 
includes an MBSS with simultaneous respi[INVESTIGATOR_400523], completion of cognitive screen 
(MoCA)  (Appendix) , and questionnaire (MDADI)  (Appendix) .  
 
If participants meet eligibil ityty criteria to participate in RST as outlined above, each participant 
will undergo in -clinic RST sessions with an SLP. After the RST is completed, participant s will 
undergo an MBSS with simultaneous recordings , completion of MDADI , and information about 
oral intake/diet tolerance (FOIS) (Appendix) for post -treatment measurements. Further, the 
participant will undergo these same procedures at 1 -month, 3 -months, and 6 -months after 
experimental portion is completed.   
 
5.6      Data Analysis  
  
Statistical Considerations. Specific Aim 1: Trial design. The primary objective of Specific 
Aim [ADDRESS_504827] in participants with dysphagi a 
with a history of OP HNC. A total of 88 participants  will be [recruited and randomly assigned 
1:1to either RST ( intervention arm ) or control arm , given the crossover design of the study. . We 
will use a stratified permuted block randomization scheme with random block sizes of 2 or 4 to 
balance important prognostic variables across the two trial arms. There will be 5 strata defined 
by [CONTACT_254855] ( radiation therapy  alone , surgery alone, chemo -radiation therapy, surgery 
+ post -operative radiation therapy, surgery + post -operative radiation therapy + adjuvant 
chemotherapy). The study statistician will maintain randomization lists and be responsible for 
randomizing consented participants . The study schema is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 8. The control arm  
will cross over to RST after visit 1 following data collection for evaluation of clinical efficacy.  
 
Endpoint Definitions and Analysis Plans.  The primary efficacy endpoint for Aim 1 is 
oropharyngeal swallowing physiologic metrics (MBSImP) and evaluated at: visit 0, defined as 
pre-RST for intervention subjects, and baseline for control subjects; and visit 1, defined as post -
RST for intervention subjects or [ADDRESS_504828] analysis of covariance (ANACOVA), with trial arm as the main effect and 
adjustment for stratification variable of treatment type. If approximate normality is not satisfied, 
we will use generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with an identity link function and robust 
standard error estimator. Furthermore, the regression framework of GEEs will accommodate 
adjustment for stratification factor. Durability of response will be evaluated using ANACOVA or 
GEEs as described by [CONTACT_83403] -RST MBSImP physiologic function metrics to those 
obtained at [ADDRESS_504829] of Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -Swallow Training on Refractory Dysphagia in OP HNC  Funding

and adjustment for stratification variables. If approximate normality is not satisfied, we will use 
generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with an identity link function and robust standard error 
estimator, which accommodates valid inference in the presence of misspecification .103,[ADDRESS_504831] FOIS measurements to those obtained at the 1 -, 3- and 6 -months follow -
up visits. In addition, we will model longitudinally collected FOIS scores as a function of time 
(measured as a categorical variable) using GEEs, with additional independent variables for 
stratification factors and pre -RST FOIS included in all models. Comparisons at individual time 
points will be performed using model -based linear contrasts with inference based on associated 
two-sided generalized score tests. We will further evaluate the modifying and confounding 
effects of sex, age, smoking status, COPD status, and pulmonary function. Secondary 
endpoints include MDADI summary scores , and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -swallow phase patterns (binary 
measure classified as optimal versus non -optimal) collected at all time points. Analysis of 
MDADI scores will follow the approach used to analyze FOIS scores. Comparisons between

RST on Swallowing Physiology. We will elaborate the treatment impact of RST by [CONTACT_400582], airway protective and morphometric changes that occur from the intervention. 
We will use MBSImP, PAS (described for Aim 1), and CASM.  
 
MBSImP Scores.  The MBSImP scores will provide a primary outcome measure of swallowing 
impairment. The MBSImP is a validated and reliable scoring system for the quantification of 
swallowing impairment from MBSS recordings.13,14,[ADDRESS_504833] 
impaired. The scale for components ranges from 0 -2 to 0 -4 for each physiologic component.14 
Years of field testing shows scores of 0 or 1 for the physiologic components of lip closure, oral 
residue, pharyngeal residue, and tongue base retraction are considered to be within normal 
limits.112 For all other components, scores greater than 0 represent some level of impairment.  
Two methods will be used for MBSImP scoring: swallow -by-swallow (SS) and overall impression 
(OI). SS scoring assigns an MBSImP score for all applicable physiologic components for each 
of the [ADDRESS_504834] (worst) score will be given during SS scoring when the participant’s  
condition or performance on a previous swallowing task results in the withholding of a 
subsequent swallowing task for safety concerns.9,52 Additionally, missing data in SS 
interpretation will result if a participant  refuses a swallowing task.52 As such, we will only include 
scores for swallowing tasks that are actually presented.  
 
Computational Analysis of Swallowing Mechanics ( CASM).  Annotators who meet reliability 
criterion109 will use a MATLAB (version R2015a, 8.5.0.197613, 64 -bit) semi -automated tracker 
tool designed specifically for coordinate mappi[INVESTIGATOR_400511].113,[ADDRESS_504835] (Co -Investigator, WP), coordinates for all swallows are concatenated and a 
second file of variables that match unique identifiers is compi[INVESTIGATOR_400512] (pre -
intervention vs. post -intervention), swallowing domain (oral vs. pharyngeal), bolus volume (large 
[cup] vs. small [5ml]), bolus viscosity (thin vs. thick), sex (male vs. female), penetration -
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_400513] (within functional limits [PAS = 1,2] vs. penetration -aspi[INVESTIGATOR_400514] = 3 -8]), and 
MBSImP component scores. These files are uploaded into MorphoJ integrated software for 
analysis.115 
 
Statistical Considerations.  The primary endpoints for Specific Aim 2 are MBSImP scores, PAS 
scores, and morphometric canonical variate scores for participants  enrolled in the clinical trial 
(Specific Aim 1). MBSImP component scores and PAS will be dichotomized as impaired versus 
not-impaired as previously described.8 Analyses of impairment rates, MBSImP composite (oral 
and pharyngeal total) scores, and time course data will be conducted using ANACOVA, GEEs 
and Rao -Scott Chi -square tests as described in Specific Aim 1. To evaluate rater reliability for

6.0 Reporting  
 
The PI (BMH) will be responsible for ensuring participant  safety on a daily basis. An internal 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  - comprised of a  radiation oncologist, medical 
oncologist, head and neck surgeon, pulmonologist, biostatistician, information technology 
specialist,  and a speech -language  patho logist - will act in an advisory capacity to monitor 
participant safety, evaluate the progress of the  study, and to review procedures for maintaining 
the confidentiality of data, the quality of data collection, management, and analyses. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_400524], DSMB, VA 
RR&D within [ADDRESS_504837] related to the study 
and/or associated with commercial interests pertinent to study objectives. Data will be presented 
in a blinded manner during the open sessions of the DSMB or in safety reports. Data and 
discussion will remain confidential during DSMB meetings and in safety reports. Participant  
identities will not be known to the DSMB members.  
 
Any unanticipated problem, SAE, and/or protocol deviations will be immediately reported to the 
PI. All the SAE will be reported within Five working days of the Investigators Knowledge of the 
event to the Hines VA IRB. In the event when the PI [INVESTIGATOR_400525], 
[CONTACT_32246] (ENT) will take over the responsibilities as a PI.

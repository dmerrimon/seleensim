Hydrochloroquine Outpatient Study  
 
UTAH One  Protocol Version 1. [ADDRESS_385137] Updated: 2021-06- 02 5 • Duration of viral shedding, as defined by [CONTACT_312755], measured on days 1 - 14. 
 2.9  Interim Monitoring: 
Formal safety review  by [CONTACT_312756] (DSMB) after 100, 200, and [ADDRESS_385138] not shown efficacy in 
preventi ng hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have antiviral and 
immune- modulating effects
1, but there are no data concerning their efficacy in reducing viral 
load and shedding in outpatients.    
 
3.1.1 Evidence supporting p ossible efficacy for hydroxychloroquine.  
In cell models, chloroquine both interferes with terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor (the 
cell surface receptor by [CONTACT_312757] -CoV-2 enters human cells) and increases endosomal pH , 
which interferes (at least in vitro ) with a crucial step in viral replication.1,[ADDRESS_385139] SARS -CoV-1.5  According to news releases, an as -yet-unpublished set of case 
series in China (N reportedly 120)  suggests the possibility of rapid viral clearance and low rates 
of progre ssion to critical illness.  In addition to in vitro anti -viral effects chloroquine and HCQ 
appear to have immune- modulatory effects, especially via suppression of release of TNF and 
IL6, especially in macrophages.1,7-[ADDRESS_385140] been studied in humans, neither agent has demonstrated consistent 
efficacy in clinical trials , including in HIV, influenza, hepatitis, and Dengue .11 In one trial, 
chloroquine resulted in increased viral replication in Chikungunya virus  [Roques et al, Viruses  
2018 May 17;10(5)]  while in another hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased HIV 
viral load  [Paton et al, JAMA 2012 Jul 25;308(4):353]. Expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_312737], another serious coronavirus.12 An underpowered (n=30)  study of HCQ  in COVID -19 
recently published in China did not demonstrate any  clinical benefit  [Chen et al, J Zhejiang 
University, 2020 March 9] . The long history of clinical failure despi[INVESTIGATOR_312738]- viral activity 
suggests a low probability of efficacy.  
 
3.1.3. Rationale for Trial  
There is significant publicity concerning the potential use of HCQ in this pandemic, and many patients are seeking access to this unproven therapy. The ANZICS guidelines emphasize that 
novel treatments should be administered within clinical trials; t he Surviving Sepsis Campaign 
guidelines ( http://bit.ly/SSCCOVID -19) also affirm the lack of evidence to support the clinical use

(https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/[ZIP_CODE]/331446/WHO -2019 -nC oV-clinical- 2020.4-

identified a potential antiviral activity for  HCQ . The rationale for this clinical trial is to measure 
the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine for reducing viral load and shedding in adult 
outpatients  with confirmed  COVID -19. 
 
3.4 Study Hypothes is 
HCQ is effective in reducing viral shedding in outpatients with confirmed COVID -19.   
 3.5  Primary endpoint  
• Duration of viral shedding, as defined by [CONTACT_312755], measured on days 1 - 14. 
 
3.6 Secondary endpoints  
• Average level  of select COVID -19-attributable symptoms  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] 14 days of enrollment. 
• Persistence of viral shedding on day  28. 
• Adult household contact [CONTACT_312758]

Pat
ients undergoing testing for SARS- CoV-2 will be informed of this actively enrolling 
interventional trial and provided with informed consent documentation (hard copy or electronic) 
at the time of testing. Patients will be asked if they would be interested in considering trial 
participation if their test is positive. Investigators will monitor test results of individuals who 
indicate interest in the trial and contact [CONTACT_312760], electronic consent, or videoconference.  The consenting

4.2  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
See sections 2.5 and 2.6.  
5.0 Study Procedures  
 
5.1 Intake medication review . 
 Prior to randomization, study personnel and/or clinical pharmacists will review medications 
being prescribed for patients on study to confirm eligibility. Study personnel will advise patients to contact [CONTACT_312761] 5 day treatment 
course so that the medication may be reviewed for risk of prolonging QTc.  
 
5.2 Cardiac  review .  
Prior to randomization, study personnel will review  if patient has electrocardiograms (ECG) and 
will verify that prolongation of QTc has not been diagnosed clinically or on ECG.  
5.3 Randomization.  
After obtaining informed consent, participants will be randomized using variable block sizes 
stratified by p atient age group (age ≤ 44, 45-59, 60- 74, 75+  years ).  The randomization system 
at the Data Coordinating Center will require entry of patient initials, date of birth and sex .  This 
will assure that patients do not attempt to enroll multiple times in order to secure active drug.   
 
5.4 Study drug .  
This is an open label,  variable block randomized placebo controlled trial.  If a participant is 
admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312739], the clinical team will decide whether or not to continue study drug treatment during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 Participants  randomized to the HCQ arm will receive HCQ 400mg po BID x 1 day, then 200mg 
po BID x 4 days
3. The drug dose (2.4 gm over 5 days) falls at the lower end of doses  proposed 
in various international trials, but it has proven in vitro efficacy, with a ratio of lung tissue trough 
concentrations to the EC50 (effective concentration to suppress 50% of viral activity) of >20.[ADDRESS_385145] the study team if any new medications are prescribed during the 5 day 
treatment course so that the medication may be revi ewed for risk of prolonging QTc, or having a 
drug interaction with HCQ (see Appendix 3).  
 Daily assessments (assessment days 1 through 15) will include review for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312740].  Daily assessments will also explicitly solicit occurrence of rash, symptomatic hypoglycemia, seizure, oxygen supplementation, nausea, vomiting, and impaired vision. Quality 
of life assessments will be made at baseline, day 28 - 2 days /+2 weeks , and six months - 1

year following the six-month  timepoint .  
 
Participants  will be taught how to perform self -collection of oral swabs for SARS- CoV-2 on 
assessment days 1 – 14 and 28 +/- 2 (considering day 1 as day of study drug delivery) .  Oral 
swabs will not be required during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], but patients will be asked to provide a swab 
on the day following discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], even if this occurs after day 28. These will be 
refrigerated after collection and collected by a courier associated with the study for transport to 
the central laboratory ( ARUP ) for testing. Tr aining will be provided with written instructions, 
video, and discussion with the research coordinators.  
 
Phlebotomy  will be performed at day 1, day 7 (+/-2 day) ,day 28 (+/-2 day)  and 6 months - 1 
week /+2 months .  This will require personal protective equipment (PPE) for the phlebotomy -
certified research staff. Note that the [ADDRESS_385148] it for up to a year  following the 
six-month timepoint .  
Blood samples  will be used to assess the immune response to SARS -CoV-2, drug screening, 
investigation of viral biology, cardiac biomarkers, and development of diagnostic assays.  Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be stored in the University of Utah 
Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) biospecimen repository .  If there i s 
remaining sample after these analyses, they may be used to study other diseases . 
 Six months after enrollment, study staff will verify subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312741].    
5.[ADDRESS_385149] oral swabs in the same 
manner and same daily schedule as the study participant.  Provision of the oral swabs will be considered implied consent, waiving the need for consent documentation.  
 5.7 Data c ollection .  
Rese arch coordinators and/or investigators will collect data and record them on paper and/or 
electronic CRF  provided by [CONTACT_36909] (DCC) . Data quality will be monitored 
by [CONTACT_312762]. Note that given concerns for contagion during the 
pandemic, coordinators will practice “no -touch” practices for data collection and entry.  
 
6.0 Analysis and interpretation of data.  
A formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be written and finalized before the conclusion of enrollment and prior to  the beginning of data analysis. The principles of this SAP are outlined 
here.  
 We note that in the unique circumstances of this trial setting, it is possible that information may 
become available that would lead to modifications of prespecified analysis.  A hypothetical 
example would be evidence from multiple global studies that a particular underlying condition is strongly associated with outcomes such as shedding or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312742].  In such circumstances, a modification to this study’s analysis plan could

Hydrochloroquine Outpatient Study  
 
UTAH One  Protocol Version 1. [ADDRESS_385150] Updated: 2021-06- [ADDRESS_385151] to compare the distribution of shedding  duration between the 
hydroxychloroquine and control groups, with administrative right censoring at day 14. The 
primary analysis will be conducted using a 2 -sided α=0.05. The log -rank test will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_312763]. The Efron approach will be used to account for tied 
shedding duration times. Kaplan- Meier curves will summarize the shedding time distributions in 
the two randomized groups.  
 
Special handling will be required in our primary analysis of shedding duration for periods in 
which patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312743]. In 
our primary analysis, we will apply a last value carried forward imputation approach during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and assume continued viral shedding during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312744] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312745]. A sensitivity analysis will right censor follow -up 
on the day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. These two analyses represent the range of plausible scenarios for shedding during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312746]; i.e., conditional on past history, the risk 
of viral shedding on any given day is at least as large for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312747] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138592]. We expect a relatively small proportion of subjects to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], limiting the 
impact of assumptions concerning shedding during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312748]. Additional sensitivity analyses, including analyses in which the end date of shedding is modeled 
as a latent variable will be considered.   
 
Quantification of the magnitude of “treatment effect”, and indeed the interpretation of the trial 
results, will depend on the specific patterns of the shedding distribution.  For example, in the 
unexpected scenario where the cumulative incidence curves for the ending of shedding actually cross during the [ADDRESS_385152] ratio with 95% confidence interval. We will also report the differences between the randomized groups in truncated mean 
shedding duration to 14 days and in median shedding duration with 95% confidence intervals 
based on estimates derived from Kaplan- Meier curves.  
 The comparison of proportion of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312749] [ADDRESS_385153] stratifying by [CONTACT_312764], with 2- sided

without being hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], these patients will be assigned to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312750]. Results will be presented as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals within each 
age stratum, and  then pooled across strata.  
 
The average symptom level for assessment days [ADDRESS_385155] stratifying 
by [CONTACT_312765]. Results 
will be presented as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals within each stratum, and then 
pooled across strata. A secondary analysis will assess the effect of treatment arm on rate of 
household viral acquisition rates averaged across all adults within the household by [CONTACT_2329] a 
modi fied Poisson regression model incorporating correlation between participants in the same 
household, and controlling for age category and number of household members.  
 The Statistical Analysis plan will detail additional analyses to be performed, including additional exploratory analysis as well as reporting of six -month outcomes among participants.   
 Safety —already well established in studies of thousands of patients and in post -marketing 
surveillance— will be assessed through counts (proportions) of adverse events, with special 
attention to those listed in the package insert for hydroxychloroquine and careful investigation of any S[LOCATION_003]Rs.  As noted elsewhere in this protocol, safety data will be reported to the trial DSMB 
after every (approximately) [ADDRESS_385156] rate due to 
hydroxychloroquine detectable with 80% power, under different overall event rates by 14 days in 
the trial (calculations done in PASS assuming a conventional proportional hazards model with treatment arm as a single predictor, using a two- sided test with alpha=0.05).  With [ADDRESS_385157] if hydroxychloroquine increases the “successful

7.0 Human Subjects Considerations . 
 
If a person without insurance is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312751] -19, he or she is eligible 
for emergency Medicaid. This is beyond usual Medicaid eligibility and related to special rules related to COVID -19 illness. In 2019, the [LOCATION_002] government issued new rules in the form 
of an executive order restricting the ability for immigrants who use public benefits, including Medicaid, from obtaining permanent residency. For many individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents of the [LOCATION_002] —whether they are documented or not —this has made 
them reluctant to use public programs for which they are eligible, including Medicaid and COVID -[ADDRESS_385161] visitors so the person contact[CONTACT_312766].

Hydrochloroquine Outpatient Study  
 
UTAH One  Protocol Version 1. [ADDRESS_385162] Updated: 2021-06- [ADDRESS_385163] (IRB) approval is required and will be secured before any subject is 
enrolled at the study site.  The DCC will not enable access to the electronic data capture or 
randomization systems until IRB documentation is received. 
 
7.2 Informed consent .  
Informed consent will be obtained from participants prior to randomization.  Proxy consent will 
not be used.   Informed consent will be obtained without an original paper signature [CONTACT_312770].   Adult household contacts who agree to provide daily swabs 
are presumed to be consenting, and documentation of consent will be waived for them.  
 7.3 Potential risks  
Risks associated with participation in this study include risks associated with HCQ administration and potential loss of confidentiality.  
 
The package insert for HCQ  lists visual impairment, cardiac impairment, QTc prolongation, 
worsening of psoriasis or porphyria, proximal myoneuropathy, suicidality, and hypoglycemia. All of these risks are quite rare and where observed are seen after prolonged administration, 
generally in the range of years. While ocular examinations are recommended after a year (and for acute symptoms), routine ocular examinations have never been recommended for brief 
duration of therapy. While QTc prolongation has been described  with HCQ, it is generally 
modest, and routine EKG monitoring is not normally practiced even during long- term 
administration of hydroxychloroquine. HCQ  may be associated with prolongation of QTc .  We 
chose a conservative threshold of 500msec as an exclusion criterion after consultation with 
electrophysiology cardiologists.  
 7.[ADDRESS_385164] patient identifiers (names, 
contact [CONTACT_3031], medical record numbers) will not be recorded at the DCC, but will be 
secured at the study sites.  The study sites will maintain lists that correlate medical record 
numbers with study ID numbers recorded in the DCC electronic data capture system. 
 
7.5 Discontinuance of HCQ  
Patients may choose to di scontinue HCQ for any reason, and HCQ will be discontinued if a 
known contraindication arises.  Study procedures should otherwise continue. This is not the same as withdrawal from the study.  
 7.6 Withdrawal from study .  
Patients may withdraw from the study at any time. Data recorded up to the time of withdrawal 
will be included in the study analysis .

UTAH One  Protocol Version 1. [ADDRESS_385165] Updated: 2021-06- 02 13  
7.7 Protocol deviations and violations .  
The investigator will not implement any deviation from, or changes of the protocol without prior review and documented approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_206684], except where necessary to eliminate immediate hazard(s) to study  subjects  or research personnel, , or 
when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial (e.g., change of telephone number(s)). Protocol deviations will be reported to the DCC within [ADDRESS_385166](s) to trial subjects without prior IRB 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. As soon as possible, the implemented deviation must be reported to 
the DCC, which will notify the medical monitor and the IRB.   
8.[ADDRESS_385167]. The following adverse events will be collected in the adverse event case report fo rms and entered into the DCC electronic data capture system :  
 
• Serious adverse events  
• Non-serious adverse events that are considered by [CONTACT_312767] 
• Adverse events that lead to permanent discontinuation of the study drug.  
 
The following adverse events will be collected prospectively as part of the study -specific 
outcome s and do not require additional adverse event reporting with the DCC  unless they meet 
criteria for being serious (defined below) : 
 
• Rash  
• Symptomatic hypoglycemia 
• Seizure  
• Cardiac arrhythmias  
• Worsening requirement for oxygen supplementation and support  
• Nausea/vomiting 
• Impaired vision  
 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events  
All serious adverse events (SAE) will be reported to the DCC.  As per federal definitions 
(primarily in 21 CFR 312.32(a)), a serious  adverse event is any adverse event that results in 
one of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death 
• A life -threatening event, one that places the subject at immediate risk of death (this does 
not include an event that, had it been more serious, would have placed the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• Prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312752] (Understanding Treatment And Health in the Ongoing coroNa Epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]) : A 
Hydrochloroquine Outpatient Study  
 
UTAH One  Protocol Version 1. [ADDRESS_385168] Updated: 2021-06- 02 14 • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity, indicating a substantial disruption of a 
person's ability to conduct normal life functions (i.e., the adverse event resulted in a 
significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the 
patient's body funct ion/structure, physical activities and/or quality of life).  
 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312753], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 SAEs must be reported to the DCC within [ADDRESS_385169] also report Unanticipated Problems  as
 sociated with the study drug or study 
procedures to the DCC within 24 hours. An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, 
or outcome that meets all  of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB- approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and the characteristics of the subject 
population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research . Possibly related means there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_8705];  it is not intended to identify the event 
as possibly related imply because it cannot be proven to be unrelated.

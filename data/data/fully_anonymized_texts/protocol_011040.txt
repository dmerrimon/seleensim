TITLE: A Phase 1, Open -Label  Study to  Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability,  and 
Pharmacokinetics of Aramchol  in Subjects  With Hepatic Impairment  
STUDY PHASE: 1 
STUDY SITES: 3 clinical sites in the [LOCATION_002]  
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of 
aramchol administered orally  in subjects with hepatic impairment with  that of healthy  
subjects . 
The secondary objective of this study is  to assess the safety and tolerability of aramchol  
administered orally in subjects with hepatic impairment. 
STUDY DESIGN:  
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open- label, 2-part, single- and multiple -dose study designed to 
assess the effect of hepatic insufficiency on the PK of aramchol . 
Each part of the study will consist of a screening period, a check -in day, a treatment period, 
and an end -of-study (EOS) visit. 
In Part 1  (single-dose), up to 48 subjects are planned : 8 subjects each in the mild (Cohort A), 
moderate (Cohort B),  and severe (Cohort C)  hepatic impairment cohorts and 8 to 24 healthy 
control subjects  with normal hepatic function (Cohort D ). Enrollment of 8 subjects with mild 
hepatic impairment (Cohort A) will proceed only if there is evidence of reduced clearance of 
aramchol in Cohort B . At screening, subjects will be assigned to a study cohort according to  
the Child -Pugh classification syste m as follows: 
Cohort  Hepatic Condition  Child -Pugh Grade  Number of Subjects  
A(a) Mild  impairment  Class A (Score of 5  to 6) 8 
B Moderate  impairment  Class B (Score of 7  to 9) 8 
C Severe  impairment  Class C (Score of 10  to 15) 8  
D Healthy  (control)  — 8 to 24  
(a) Enrollment of subjects into Cohort A will only proceed if there is evidence of reduced clearance of aramchol 
in Cohort B.  
Healthy control subjects ( Cohort D ) will be matched with hepatically impaired subjects 
(Cohorts A, B, and C) according to gender, age (±10 years), and body mass index (±20%). 
Safety data and PK profiles of aramchol from at least 4  subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Cohort B) will be obtained and reviewed whil e enrol lment to this c ohort 
continues. These [ADDRESS_876132] demonstrate satisfactory safety (no serious 
adverse events [AEs] or severe AEs related to aramchol ) and PK results  for up to 4 days after 
dosing before enrollment of subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Cohort C) is  initiated.  
Two subjects with severe hepatic impairment must demonstrate satisfactory safety and 
tolerability (no serious AEs or severe AEs related to aramchol) for up to 4 days after dosing 
before the remaining subjects with severe hepatic impairment may be dosed. 
Galmed Research and Development Ltd  Aramchol  
Protocol No. Aramchol -019 Clinical Study Protocol 
  Page 8 Enrollment of subjects into Cohort A ( mild hepatic impairment) will proceed only if there is 
evidence of  reduced clearance of aramchol in the first 4  subjects in Cohort B (moderate 
hepatic impairment) , defined as a reduction in apparent total oral clearance (CL/F) of greater 
than 30% compared with values in historical healthy control subjects.   
In Part [ADDRESS_876133] 8 subjects comprising of mild and modera te or moderate and 
severe hepatic impairment subjects will be administered  aramchol as multiple  doses to obtain 
the PK profile of aramchol at steady state. A decision on the severity of hepatic impairment 
of subjects to participate in Part 2 (multiple -dose) will be made by [CONTACT_652565]  1 (single-dose). 
Healthy control subjects will be matched with the hepatically impaired subjects according to 
gender , age (±10  years), and body mass index (± 20%). 
Single Dose (Part 1): 
On Day 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose of [ADDRESS_876134]. Subjects will remain fasted except for 
water for 2 hours after dosing. During the study, subjects may consume water on an ad 
libitum basis. Hepatically impaired subjects will receive a diet standardized for hepatic 
impairment and healthy control subjects w ill receive a similar diet. 
Serial b lood samples for PK analysis of aramchol concentrations in plasma will be collected 
before  dosing (0 hour) and up to 168 hours for healthy subjects and 240 hours for hepatic ally 
impaired subjects  after administration of aramchol.  
Subjects will be confined to the clinical site from Day –1 until discharge on Day 8 for healthy 
control subjects and on Day 11 for hepatically impaired subjects . The duration of the study, 
excluding screening, is approximately 23 days.  
Multiple Dose  (Part 2): 
Multiple  dosing will involve twice daily (approximately  12 hours apart ) oral administration 
of aramchol for 11 days with a single AM dose on Day 12 to a chieve steady  state. The dosage 
will not exceed  300 mg twice daily but may be adjusted to give lower exposure depending on 
review of available data on any reduction in clearance associated with hepatic impairment seen with single doses in Part 1 . Subjects will consume a standardized meal 30 minutes prior 
to the AM and PM doses of aram chol. Subjects will remain fasted except for water for 
2 hours after dosing. During the study, subjects may consume water on an ad libitum basis. Hepatically impaired subjects will receive a diet standardized for hepatic impairment and healthy control subjects will receive a similar diet.  
Blood samples for analysis of aramchol concentrations in plasma will be collected before the AM dose on Days 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 and at intervals to 12 hours after the AM dose on 
Day 12. Samples of plasm a will also be stored for analysis of metabolites pending results of a 
mass balance study.

STUDY PROCEDURES : 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  and Endpoints : 
Single Dose (Part 1): 
Blood samples for analysis of concentrations of aramchol and its metabolites in plasma will be collected at the following time points: before dosing (0 hour) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, and 240 hours (the last 2 time points are for hepatically impaired subjects only) after administration of aramchol. 
The following plasma PK parameters will be calculated as endpoints for aramchol using 
actual sampling times rather than scheduled sampling times:  
• Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) from time [ADDRESS_876150] 
quantifiable concentration (AUC
0-t) 
• AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf) 
• Maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) 
• Time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (T max) 
• Time to the first measurable plasma concentration (T lag) 
• Apparent t erminal elimination half -life (t 1/2) 
• Apparent oral clearance (CL/F)  
• Apparent volume of distribution (V z/F) 
• Elimination rate constant ( ke) 
Multiple Dose  (Part 2): 
Blood samples for analysis of concentrations of aramchol and its metabolites in plasma will be collected before the AM dose on Days  1, 4, 8, 9. 10, 11, and 12 and at the following times 
after the AM dose on Day 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours. 
The following plasma PK parameters on Day 12 will be calculated  as endpoints for aramchol 
using actual sampling times rather than scheduled sampling times  (if conducted): 
• AUC from time 0 to the dosing interval tau at steady state (AUC
0-tau, ss) 
Galmed Research and Development Ltd  Aramchol  
Protocol No. Aramchol -019 Clinical Study Protocol 
  Page 13 • Maximum observed plasma concentration at steady state (C max, ss ) 
• Time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration at steady state (T max, ss ) 
• Minimum observed plasma concentration at steady state (C min, ss ) 
• Time of minimum observed plasma concentration at steady state (T min, ss) 
• Average plasma concentration at steady state (C avg, ss) 
Time to reach steady state will also be estimated graphically by [CONTACT_652568] (ie, pre-AM dosing on Days 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12) over 12 days of 
administration.  
Safety Assessments  and Endpoints : 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_106342]: monitoring and recording of AEs, clinical laboratory test results ( hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and 
urinalysis), vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECG results, and physical examination findings. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLANS:  
Sample Size:  
For Part 1, up to 48 subjects  are planned : 8 subjects each in the mild (Cohort A), moderate 
(Cohort B), and severe (Cohort C) hepatic impairment groups, and 8 to 24 healthy control 
subjects with normal hepatic function  (Cohort D). For Part 2, at least 8 subjects with mild 
and moderate or moderate and  severe hepatic impairment and up to 8 healthy control subjects 
with normal hepatic function are planned. The sample size was chosen for this study based 
on clinical and practical considerations and not on a formal statistical power calculation. The 
US Food and Drug Administration Guidance for Industry, Pharmacokinetics in Patients With 
Impaired Hepatic Function: Study Design, Data Analysis, and Impact on Dosing and 
Labeling , was used as a guide to select the sample size, which is considered sufficient to 
adequately assess the safety and PK profiles of aramchol . 
In the event of early withdrawals or discontinuations, subjects may be replaced at the discretion of the investigator, and after consultation with the medical monitor and sponsor if the number of com pleters will be less than 6 subjects in any cohort. 
Analysis Sets : 
The PK population will include subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_876151] 1 dose of  aramchol . 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses:  
Plasma concentrations will be listed  and summarized descriptively (number of subjects, 
arithmetic mean, standard deviation [ SD], coefficient of variation [CV], minimum, median, 
and maximum). Plasma concentration versus actual time profiles for each subject will be 
presented graphically . The mean plasma concentration versus scheduled time profiles will be 
presented graphically.  
Galmed Research and Development Ltd  Aramchol  
Protocol No. Aramchol -019 Clinical Study Protocol 
  Page 14 Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma concentration da ta using 
noncompartmental methods will be summarized by [CONTACT_652569] 
(number of subjects, arithmetic mean, SD, CV , minimum, medi an, and maximum). 
Geometric mean and geometric CV will also be calculated for AUCs and C max. The AUC 0-t, 
AUC 0-inf, and C max values may also be expressed in terms of unbound drug concentrations. 
An analysis of variance (ANOV A) model will be performed on the natural logarithms of 
AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max to calculate the ratio of geometric means and its 90% confidence 
interval between subjects with hepatic impairment and the corresponding healthy control 
subjects , as appropriate. The ANOV A model will include hepatic group ( normal  matching 
mild, mild, normal matching moderate , moderate, normal match ing severe, and severe, where 
applicable) as  a fixed effect . 
For AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max, a linear regression  model will be performed on the natural 
logarithms of AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and  Cmax as dependent variables and each of the following 
natural -log-transformed hepatic function estimates as independent variables: Child -Pugh 
classification score (in subjects with hepatic impairment only), baseline serum bilirubin, 
serum albumin, and prothrombin time. The regression coefficients representing the relationship between the PK parameters and the hepatic function estimates will be estimated together with their 90% confidence intervals from the regression model. 
Sensitivity analyses may be conducted to investigate the potential impact of imbalance 
existing acr oss hepatic impairment groups in the distribution of the baseline covariates used 
in subject matching (eg, body weight ) and , if data suggest, appreciable differences in PK 
exposure ( AUC
0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max) across different values of the same baseline covariate.  
Detailed descriptions of the analyses in this study will be presented in the s tatistical analysis 
plan.  
Safety Analyses:  
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_308261]. All AE data will be presented in 
a data listing . Treatment -emergent AEs will  be summarized by [CONTACT_652570], 
as well as by [CONTACT_11762]. Serious AEs and AEs leading to early 
discontinuation will also be presented in data listings. 
Actual values and changes from baseline for clinical laboratory test results, vital sign 
measurements, and 12- lead ECG results will be summarized by [CONTACT_652571] (number of subjects, mean, SD, minimum, median, and 
maximum).  Shift tables will be generated for clinical laboratory test results. Clinical 
laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, 12- lead EC G results, and physical 
examination findings will be presented in data listing s.

1.1 BACKGROUND  
Aramchol is a novel conjugate of cholic acid (bile acid) and arachidic acid (saturated fatty 
acid), linked by a stable amide group. It  is in development for treatment of nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. Aramchol affects stearoyl coenzyme A  desaturase 1 , a 
key liver enzyme involved in regulating lipid metabolism. In animal models of NASH, it 
reduces steatosis, ballooning, inflammation , and fibrosis by [CONTACT_100276]-regulation of stearoyl 
coenzyme A desaturase 1  expression in hepatocytes and hepatic s tellate cells.  
Aramchol is highly lipophilic and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in humans show that plasma 
concentrations increase less than proportionally to dose due to poor absorption. Its mean 
terminal phase half -life ( t1/2) is approximately [ADDRESS_876152] of the drug is cleared with a 
t1/[ADDRESS_876153] of varying degrees of hepatic impairment on the PK, 
safety , and tolerability of a single oral dose of 600 mg (2 × 300- mg tablets) aramchol  in

1.3 RATIONALE FOR  DOSE SELECTION  
A single oral dose of 600 mg aramchol in Part 1 and multiple oral doses not to exceed 
300 mg aramchol twice daily for 11 days and a single AM dose on Day 12 in Part 2 will be  
evaluated in this study based on the recommendations provided in the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry, Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Impaired 
Hepatic Function: Study Design, Data Analysis, and Impact on Dosing and Labeling 
(DHHS  2003).  Though single doses up to [ADDRESS_876155] of a screening period, a check -in day, a treatment period, 
and an end- of-study ( EOS ) visit.  
In Part 1  (single-dose), up to 48 subjects are planned : 8 subjects each in the mild (Cohort A), 
moderate (Cohort B), and severe (Cohort C) hepatic impairment cohorts and 8 to 24 healthy 
control subjects with normal hepatic function (Cohort D). Enrollment of 8 subjects  with mild 
hepatic impairment (Cohort A) will proceed only if there is evidence of reduced clearance of 
aramchol in Cohort B. At screening, subjects will be assigned to a study cohort according to  
the Ch ild-Pugh classification system as follows: 
Cohort  Hepatic Condition  Child -Pugh Grade  Number  of Subjects  
A(a) Mild  impairment  Class A (Score of 5  to 6) 8 
B Moderate  impairment  Class B (Score of 7  to 9) 8

(a) Enrollment of subjects into Cohort A will only proceed if there is evidence of reduced clearance of aramchol 
in Cohort B.  
Healthy control subjects ( Cohort D ) will be matched with hepatically impaired subjects 
(Cohorts A, B, and C) according to gender, age (±10 years), and body mass index (BMI) 
(±20%). 
Safety data and PK profiles of aramchol from at  least 4 subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Cohort B) will be obtained and reviewed whil e enrol lment to this c ohort 
continues. These [ADDRESS_876156] demonstrate satisfactory safety (no serious AEs 
[SAEs] or severe AEs related to aramchol) and PK results for up to 4 days after dosing before 
enrollment of subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Cohort C) is  initiated.  Two subjects 
with severe hepatic impairment must demonstrate satisfactory safety and tolerability (no 
SAEs or severe AEs related to aramchol) for up to 4 days after dosing before the remaining 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment may be dosed. 
Enroll ment o f subjects to Cohort A (mild hepatic impairment) will proceed only if there is 
evidence of  reduced clearance of aramchol in the first 4  subjects in Cohort B (moderate 
hepatic impairment) , defined as a reduction in apparent total oral clearance ( CL/F ) of greater 
than 30% compared with values in historical healthy control subjects.  
Galmed Research and Development Ltd  Aramchol  
Protocol No. Aramchol -[ADDRESS_876157] 8 subjects comprising of mild and moderate or moderate and 
severe hepatic impairment subjects will be administered aramchol as multiple doses  to obtain 
the PK profile of aramchol at steady state. A decision on the severity of hepatic impairment 
of subjects to participate in Part 2 (multiple -dose) will be made by [CONTACT_652565]  1 (single-dose). 
Healthy control subjects will be matched with the hepatically impaired subjects according to 
gender , age (±10  years), and BMI  (±20%). 
Single Dose (Part 1): 
On Day 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose of [ADDRESS_876158]. Subjects will remain 
fasted except for water for 2 hours after dosing. During the study, subjects may consume 
water on an ad libitum basis. Hepatically impaired subjects will receive a diet standardized 
for hepatic impairment  and healthy control subjects will receive a similar diet. 
Serial blood samples for PK analysis of aramchol concentrations in plasma will be collected 
before  dosing (0 hour) and up to 168 hours for healthy subjects and 240 hours for hepatic ally 
impaired subjects  after administration of aramchol.  
Subjects will be confined to the clinical site from Day –1 until discharge on Day 8 for healthy 
control subjects and on Day 11 for hepatically impaired subjects. The duration of the study, excluding screening, is approximately 23 days.  
Multiple Dose (Part 2): 
Multiple dosing will involve twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart ) oral administration 
of aramchol for 11 days with a single AM dose on Day 12 to a chieve steady  state. The dosage 
will not exceed 300 mg twice daily but may be adjusted to give lower exposure depending on 
review of available data on any reduction in clearance associated with hepatic impairment 
seen with single doses in Part 1 . Subjects will consume a standardized meal 30  minutes prior 
to the AM and PM doses of aramchol.  Subjects will remain fasted  except fo r water  for 
2 hours after dosing. During the study, subjects may consume water on an ad libitum basis. 
Hepatically impaired subjects will receive a diet standardized for hepatic impairment and 
healthy control subjects will receive a similar diet.  
Blood samples for analysis of aramchol concentrations in plasma will be collected  before the 
AM dose on Days 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 and at intervals to 12 hours after the AM dose on

5. STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 TREATMENTS ADMINISTERED 
All doses of study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_78141] 240 mL of room temperature water. During the study, subjects may consume water on an ad libitum basis. 
Hepatically impaired subjects will receive a diet standardized for hepatic impairment and healthy control subjects will receive a similar diet. Subjects should receive these meals at the 
same time during each part of the study. 
Single Dose ( Part 1 ): 
On Day  1, all subjects will receive a single oral dose of 600 mg  (2 × 300- mg tablets) 
aramchol  in the morning, after an overnight fast of at least [ADDRESS_876180] . 
Multiple Dose ( Part 2 ): 
Starting on Day 1, a ll subjects will receive an oral dose of aramchol that will not exceed 
300 mg twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart) for [ADDRESS_876181] 
according to the schedule of events for Parts 1 and 2 (Section  3.1 and Section 3.2, 
respectively ). 
All study drugs must be stored according to the labeled instructions in a secure cabinet or 
room with access restricted to necessary  site personnel . The site will be required to keep a 
temperature log to establish a record of compliance with storage conditions.

regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all study drugs will be reconciled and retained or , with approval of the sponsor, destroyed according to applicable regulations. 
5.3 METHOD OF ASSIGNING SUBJECTS TO TREATMENT 
GROUPS 
This is a nonrandomized study. At screening, hepaticall y impaired subjects will be  assigned 
to a study group based on their level of hepatic function according to the Child -Pugh 
classification system, as shown in Table 5–1. To allocate subjects to the appropriate cohort of 
hepatic impairment severity, a history of higher severity that has responded to medication will be taken into account. Thus, subjects with a history of Grade [ADDRESS_876183] receiving the higher score.

6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Before performing any study procedures, all potential subjects will sign an ICF as outlined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Subjects will undergo study procedures at the time points specified in the 
schedule of events for Parts 1 and 2 ( Section  3.1 and Section 3.2,  respectively ). 
The total amount of blood collected from each subject  over the duration of the study, 
including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 500 mL. 
6.1 PHARMACOKINE TIC ASSESSMENTS  AND ENDPOINTS  
Singl e Dose (Part 1):  
Blood samples for analysis of concentrations of aramchol and its metabolites in plasma will 
be collected at the following time points: before dosing (0 hour) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 
12, 14, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, and 240 hours (the last 2 time points are for hepatically impaired subjects only) after administration of aramchol.  Acceptable time 
deviations are ±5 minutes for 0 to 4 hours, ±10 minutes for >4 to 8 hours, ±15 minutes for 
>8 to 24 hours, ±30 minutes for >24 to 72 hours, and ±60 minutes for >72 hours to 
240 hours. 
The following plasma PK parameters will be calculated as endpoints for aramchol  using 
actual sampling times rather than scheduled sampling t imes:  
• AUC from time [ADDRESS_876185] quantifiable concentration (AUC
0-t) 
Galmed Research and Development Ltd  Aramchol  
Protocol No. Aramchol -019 Clinical Study Protocol 
  Page 34 • AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf) 
• Maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) 
• Time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (T max) 
• Time to the first measurable p lasma concentration (T lag) 
• Apparent t erminal elimination half -life (t 1/2) 
• Apparent oral clearance (CL/F)  
• Apparent volume of distribution (V z/F) 
• Elimination  rate constant ( ke) 
Multiple Dose (Part 2): 
Blood samples for analysis of concentrations of aramchol and its metabolites in plasma will 
be collected before the AM dose on Days 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 and at the following times 
after the AM dose on Day 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours. Ac ceptable time deviations 
are ±5 minutes for 0 to 4 hours, ±10 minutes for >4 to 8 hours, and ±15 minutes for >8 to 12 hours. 
The following plasma PK parameters on Day 12 will be calculated as endpoints for aramchol  
using actual sampling times rather than s cheduled sampling times (if conducted): 
• AUC from time 0 to the dosing interval tau at steady state (AUC
0-tau, ss) 
• Maximum observed plasma concentration at steady state ( Cmax, ss ) 
• Time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration at steady state (T max, ss ) 
• Minimum observed plasma concentration at steady state (C min, ss ) 
• Time of minimum observed plasma concentration at steady state (T min, ss) 
• Average plasma concentration at steady state (C avg, ss) 
Time to reach steady state will also be estimated gra phically by [CONTACT_652578] (ie, pre-AM dosing on Days 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12) over 12 days of 
administration .

6.1.2 Pharmacokinetic Sample Analysis 
Pharmacokinetic samples will be analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography coupled 
with tand em mass spectrometry assay for  aramchol  in human plasma. Assay results and 
validation details will be provided in a separate bioanalytical report. Stored samples of plasma will also be analyzed for aramchol metabolites pending results of a mass balance study. 
6.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  AND ENDPOINTS  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_106342]: monitoring and recording 
of AEs, clinical laboratory test results (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and 
urinalysis) , vital sign  measurement s, 12-lead ECG results, and physical examination findings. 
For all safety assessments, t he investigator will determine whether results are  clinically 
significant, which is defined as any variation in a result  that has medical relevance and may 
result in an a lteration in medical care (eg, active observation, diagnostic measures,  or 
therapeutic measures). If clinical significance is noted, the result  and reason for significance 
will be documented and an AE reported on the AE page in the subject’s eCRF. T he 
investigator will monitor the subject until the result has  reached the reference range or the 
result at screening, or until the investigator determines that follow-up is no longer medically 
necessary . 
6.2.[ADDRESS_876186] signs the ICF until EOS and should 
be followed until they are resolved, stable, or judged by [CONTACT_11769].  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF 
and SA Es are reported to the sponsor, regardless of their relationship to study drug or clinical 
significance. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.

Protocol No. Aramchol -019 Clinical Study Protocol 
  Page 36 [IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_652579]. 
A treatment -emergent AE  is defined as any event not present before exposure to study drug 
or any event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency after exposure. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study drug caused the AE. For the purposes of investigational new drug safety reporting, “reasonable possibility ” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the study drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than an adverse reaction.  
An adverse reaction is any AE caused by a study drug. Adverse reactions belong to a subset of all suspected adverse reactions and indicate that there are reasons to conclude that the study drug caused the event. 
An AE  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator ’s brochur e or if it occurs with  specificity or severity that has not been previously 
observed with the study drug being tested. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered an SAE/suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
norma l life functions  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
Galmed Research and Development Ltd  Aramchol  
Protocol No. Aramchol -019 Clinical Study Protocol 
  Page 37 one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
An AE  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life threatening” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence pla ces the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that might have caused death  if it had 
been more severe. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
Subjects will be asked a standard question to elicit any medically related changes in their well-being. They will also be asked if they have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and 
over-the-counter medications).  
In addition to subject observations, AEs will be documented from any data collected on the 
AE page in the eCRF (eg, laboratory values, physical examination findings, and ECG 
changes) or other documents that are relevant to subject safety.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded in the source documentation 
and on the AE page in  the eCRF. Information to be collected includes drug treatment, type of 
event, time of onset, dosage, investigator-specified assessment of severity and relationship to study drug, time of resolution of the event, seriousness, any require d treatment or 
evaluations, and outcome. Any AE s resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to 
concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed until they are re solved, stable, or judged by 
[CONTACT_11755]. The Medical Dictionary of Regulatory 
Activities will be used to code all AEs.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened but does not 
deteri orate should not be reported as an AE but will be recorded as  medical history . However, 
if it deteriorates at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. 
Any AE that is considered serious by [CONTACT_652580] 
(Secti on [IP_ADDRESS])  must be reported to the sponsor (or the sponsor’s designee) following the 
Galmed Research and Development Ltd  Aramchol  
Protocol No. Aramchol -019 Clinical Study Protocol 
  Page 38 guidelines provided on the study SAE form as soon as site personnel/investigator have 
become aware of the event and no later than [ADDRESS_876187] not be delayed even when 
information is incomplete at the time of the initial report. Any additional (follow -up) 
information that becomes available after the initial reporting should be forwarded in a follow-up SAE report form by [CONTACT_652581] 24 hours of the information 
becoming available.  
All SAEs should be followed until resolution or stabilization of all parameters (including 
laboratory) return to baseline or until the investigator assesses them as stable or until the 
subje ct is lost to follow -up. 
The sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of any SAE as outlined in US  Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR)  Parts [ADDRESS_876188] (IRB) directly . 
For this study, the following contact [CONTACT_308247]: 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE refers to the extent to which it affects the subject’s daily activities  and will be classified as mild, moderate, or severe using the following criteria: 
• Mild: These events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate:  These events result in a low level of inconvenience or require minor 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with normal functioning. 
• Severe:  These events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating . 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be assessed. An AE characterized as intermittent does not require 
documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].

  Page 39 [IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is part of the 
documentation process but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the 
study. 
The investigator will assess causality (ie, whether  there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study drug caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be classified as 
follows: 
• Not related: There is not a reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug. The AE 
does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration or  can be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s cli nical state or other factors (eg , disease under 
study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications). 
• Related: There is a reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug. The AE follows a 
reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration  and cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other factors (eg, disease under study, 
conc urrent diseases, or concomitant medications), represents a known reaction to the 
study drug or other drugs in its class, is consistent with the known pharmacological 
properties of the study drug, and/or resolves with discontinuation of the study drug (and/or recurs with rechallenge, if applicable). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow-up of Adverse Events  
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page in the eCRF and followed until 
they are resolved, stable , or judged by [CONTACT_11755]. 
6.2.2 Clinical Laboratory Testing  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by [CONTACT_145889]’ local laboratories . Blood and 
urine samples will be collected and prepared using standard procedures.  
Repeat  clinical  laboratory tests may be performed at the d iscretion of the investigator, if 
necessary, to evaluate inclusion and exclusion criteria or clinical laboratory abnormalities.  
The clinical laboratory that will perform the tests will provide the reference ranges for all clinical laboratory parameters.  Abnormal clinical laboratory values will be flagged as either 
high or low (or normal or abnormal) based on the reference ranges for each laboratory 
parameter.

7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLANS 
7.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS  
For Part 1, up to 48 subjects  are planned: 8 subjects each  in the mild (Cohort A), moderate 
(Cohort B), and severe (Cohort C) hepatic impairment cohorts and 8 to 24 healthy control 
subjects with normal hepatic function  (Cohort D). For Part 2, at least 8 subjects with mild 
and moderate or moderate and severe hepatic impairment and up to 8 healthy control subjects 
with normal hepatic function are planned. The sample size was chosen for this study based 
on clinical and practical considerations and not on a formal statistical power calculation. The 
US Food and Drug Administration Guidance for Industry, Pharmacokinetics in Patients With 
Impaired Hepatic Function: Study Design, Data Analysis, and Impact on Dosing and Labeling  (DHHS 2003 ) was used as a guide to select the sample size, which is considered 
sufficient to adequately assess the safety and PK profiles of aramchol . 
In the event of early withdrawals or discontinuations, subjects may  be replaced at the 
discretion of the investigator, and after consultation with the medical monitor and sponsor if the number of completers will be less than  6 subjects in any cohort. 
7.2 ANALYSIS SETS  
The analysis populations are as follows: 
• The PK population will include subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_876191] 1  PK parameter . In 
Galmed Research and Development Ltd  Aramchol  
Protocol No. Aramchol -019 Clinical Study Protocol 
  Page 43 Part 1, subjects who experience vomiting  within 6 hours after study drug dosing will be 
excluded from the PK analysis. 
• The safety population will include all subject s who receive at least 1  dose of  aramchol . 
7.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Details of all statistical analyses will be described in a statistical analysis plan. All data 
collected will be presented in data listings. Data from subjects excluded from an analysis 
population will be presented in the data listings but not included in the calculation of 
summary statistics.  
For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statis tics (number of subjects, mean, standard 
deviation [ SD], minimum, median, and maximum). 
Baseline demographic and background variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_652582]. The number of subjects who enroll in the study and the number and percentage of subjects who complete the study will be presented. Frequency and percentage of subjects 
who withdraw or discontinue from the study, and the reason for withdr awal or 
discontinuation, will also be summarized.  
7.3.1 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentrations will be listed  and summarized descriptively (number of subjects, 
arithmetic mean, SD, coefficient of variation [CV], minimum, median , and maximum). 
Plasma concentration versus actual time profiles for each subject will be presented 
graphically . The mean plasma concentration versus scheduled time profiles will be presented 
graphically.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma concentration data using 
noncom partmental methods with  Phoenix® WinNonlin® (Certara [LOCATION_003] Inc, Princeton, New 
Jersey ) Version 8.0 or higher will be summarized by [CONTACT_652569] 
(number of subjects, arithmetic mean, SD, CV , minimum, medi an, and maximum). 
Geometric mean and geometric CV will also be calculated for AUCs and C max. The AUC 0-t, 
AUC 0-inf, and C max values may also be expressed in terms of unbound drug concentrations. 
An analysis of variance (ANOV A) model will be performed on the natural logarithms of AUC
0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max to calculate the ratio of geometric means and its 90% confidence 
interval between subjects with hepatic impairment and the corresponding healthy control 
Galmed Research and Development Ltd  Aramchol  
Protocol No. Aramchol -019 Clinical Study Protocol 
  Page 44 subjects , as appropriate. The ANOV A model will include hepatic group ( normal  matching  
mild,  mild , normal matching moderate, moderate, normal matching  severe, and severe, where 
applicable) as  a fixed effect . 
For AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max, a linear regression  model will be performed on the natural 
logarithms of A UC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and  Cmax as dependent variables and each of the following 
natural -log-transformed hepatic function estimates as independent variables: Child -Pugh 
classification score (in subjects with hepatic impairment only), baseline serum bilirubin, 
serum albumin, and prothrombin time. The regression coefficients representing the 
relationship between the PK parameters and the hepatic function estimates will be estimated together with their 90% confidence intervals from the regression model. 
Sensitivity analyses may be conducted to investigate the potential impact of imbalance 
existing across hepatic impairment groups in the distribution of the baseline covariates used 
in subject matching (eg, body weight ) and , if data suggest, appreciable differences in PK 
exposure ( AUC
0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max) across different values of the same baseline covariate.  
Detailed descriptions of the analyses in this study will be presented in the s tatistical analysis 
plan.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_876192] results, vital sign 
meas urements, and 12- lead ECG results will be summarized by [CONTACT_652583] (number of subjects, mean, SD, minimum, median, and 
maximum).  Shift tables will be generated for clinical laboratory test results. Clinical 
laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECG results, and physical 
examination findings will be presented in data listing s. 
7.4 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 
Plasma concentrations that are below the limit of quantification (BLQ) will be treated as zero 
for descriptive statistics. Mean BLQ concentrations will be presented as BLQ, and the SD

determine that it is consistent with ensuring the participant&prime;s continued welfare. Examples: 
Convened Board Increase in target enrollment for investigator initiated research or potential Phase I 
research Expanding inclusion or removing exclusion criteria where the new population may be at 
increased risk Revised risk information with active participants Minor risk revisions that may affect a 
subject&prime;s willingness to continue to participate Expedited Review Increase in target enrollment 
at Penn where overall enrollment target is not exceeded or potentially sponsored research Expanding 
inclusion or removing exclusion where the new population has the same expected risk as the previous, 
based on similarities of condition Revised risk information with subjects in long-term follow-up Minor 
risk revisions with no subjects enrolled to date 
Expedited Review
Modi®cation Summary
Please describe any required modiﬁcation to the protocol. If you are using this form to submit an 
exception or report a deviation, enter 'N/A' in the box below.
We initially planned to power the study on two primary outcomes, sleep latency and health related 
quality of life and required a sample size of 40. However, given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], Covid-[ADDRESS_511225] level estimate and GEE provides population averaged 
estimates changing from one to another would be answering two different questions. But our outcome is 
continuous and both approaches will provide population averaged estimate, using either mixed-effects 
model or GEE is appropriate.

Page [ADDRESS_511228] instruments the detail here can be brief. More detail may be required 
for a novel or new instrument. For ethnographic studies identify any study instruments to be used (i.e. 
for deception studies) and describe in detail where, when and how the study will be conducted and who 
or what are the subjects of study. Note: For more information on how to conduct ethical and valid 
ethnographic research, follow the link For oral histories or interviews provide the general framework 
for questioning and means of data collection. If interviews or groups settings are to be audio taped or 
video taped describe in detail the conditions under which it will take place. Include a copy of any novel 
or new test instruments with the IRB submission. 
Sleep Measures: Consensus Sleep Diary (electronic version). We will derive sleep latency, wake after 
sleep onset, sleep efﬁciency, total sleep time, and daytime nappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; Actigraphy will be used objectively 
assess various variables such as leep latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efﬁciency, total sleep time, 
and daytime inactivity; Insomnia Severity Index (ISI),a widely used measure of insomnia; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22336] (PSQI), a widely used measure of sleep quality; Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110], a 
widely used measure of daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]; Pre-sleep Arousal Index, this measure has been shown to 
change with relaxation and mindfulness training based on prior work performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gooneratne; 
Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS-16), a validated instrument to assess 
maladaptive beliefs regarding sleep that exacerbate insomnia, and has been shown to improve with 
insomnia treatment; the 16-item version will be used as it has more favorable psychometric properties 
than the 30-item or 10-item versions. Quality of Life: RAND Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 
(SF-36), one of the most widely used health-related quality of life measures, frequently used to measure 
HRQOL in older adults. It is a multidomain that measures physical and mental components of HRQOL 
with eight subscales. The 8 subscales contribute to two resulting component summaries: a mental 
component summary (MCS) and a physical component summary (PCS). Both PCS and MCS scores 
range from [ADDRESS_511229] health. Higher scores indicate better HRQOL. Global 
Activity: Pleasant Events Schedule; participants will rate how often they do certain activities and how 
much they enjoy it. Results will guide the tailoring of the intervention.  Physical Activity: Objective PA, 
characterized by [CONTACT_405590] (counts/minute), will be measured by [CONTACT_405591]. 
Subjective PA will be obtained from the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). Cognition: 
Telephone interview for Cognitive Status (TICS). TICS is a standardized test of cognitive function that 
can be administered over the phone or in person. Participants are given a TICS Total Score which is 
associated with one of four impairment ranges: Unimpaired, Ambiguous, Mildly Impaired, and 
Moderately to Severely Impaired. TICS-M scores of 28-36, based off ranges and optimal cutpoints 
determined in various studies, will determine eligible participants. (Graff-Radford wt al., 2006; Cook et 
al., 2009; Zietemann et al., 2017; Knopman et al., 2010). Social Activity: Participation in social activity 
will be recorded in the tablet.  Systemic inﬂammatory biomarkers, including cytokines (IL-6, IL-1ß, 
TNF-) and C-reactive protein (CRP), will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention and [ADDRESS_511230] 
intervention follow up. These will be assayed using dried blood spots (DBS). DBS provides an easy to 
obtain, transport, and analyze blood source. (Ostler MW, Porter JH, Buton OM. Dried blood spot 
collection of health biomarkers to maximize participation in population studies. Journal of Visualized 
Experiments, 83, [ZIP_CODE].) Participants will be instructed to use a Lancet to prick their ﬁnger and drop 
ﬁve drops of blood onto ﬁlter paper. They will keep the ﬁlter paper with blood spots lying ﬂat and 
uncovered at room temperature to 24-[ADDRESS_511231] in the refrigerator. After 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_9107], the blood sample will be labeled, transported, and stored in a -80°C freezer until ready to be 
analyzed. All four biomarkers will be stored at Laboratory of Innovative and Translational Nursing 
Research and then assayed at CHOP Translational Core Laboratory utilizing a matrix independent 
platform (Mesoscale Discovery, Rockville MD). Other information includes age, race, education, life 
style (tobacco and alcohol use, BMI), depression (15-item GDS-SF 132,133 has been validated as an 
assessment of depression, with a yes/no format that facilitates use), medication use (antidepressant, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sleep medication), and self-reported medical conditions. This information will be 
collected via questionnaires.
Page 9 of 26Group Modi®cations
Describe necessary changes that will or have been made to the study instruments for different groups.
No modiﬁcations will be made.
Method for Assigning Subjects to Groups
Describe how subjects will be randomized to groups.
The proposed study is a randomized controlled non-crossover pi[INVESTIGATOR_7368] 27 participants will 
be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the MBSI-I intervention arm or an education only control arm for a 
treatment period of four weeks. Assignment by 1:[ADDRESS_511232] 1:1 simple randomization.
Administration of Surveys and/or Process
Describe the approximate time and frequency for administering surveys and/or evaluations. For surveys, 
questionnaires and evaluations presented to groups and in settings such as high schools, focus group 
sessions or community treatment centers explain how the process will be administered and who will 
oversee the process. For instance, discuss the potential issues of having teachers and other school 
personnel administer instruments to minors who are students especially if the content is sensitive in 
nature. Describe the procedure for audio and videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_405567]/or focus groups and 
the storage of the tapes. For instance, if audio tape recording is to be used in a classroom setting, 
describe how this will be managed if individuals in the class are not participating in the study. Explain 
if the research involves the review of records (including public databases or registries) with identiﬁable 
private information. If so, describe the type of information gathered from the records and if identiﬁers 
will be collected and retained with the data after it is retrieved. Describe the kinds of identiﬁers to be 
obtained, (i.e. names, social security numbers) and how long the identiﬁers will be retained and 
justiﬁcation for use. 
Baseline (pre-treatment) assessments, collected at Visit 1, subjective sleep measures and measures of 
health related quality of life, physical activity, cognition, social activity, and blood samples.  
Intervention: A 4-week intervention (see intervention description below) will be provided to 
participants randomized to the intervention group. Sleep diaries will be completed and Actigraphs worn 
for all four weeks of treatment, in both groups.  Post-intervention and Follow-up data collection (visit 2 
week 5; visit 3 week 16): All baseline assessments will be repeated immediately post- intervention and 
at three months post-intervention follow-up (sleep measures and measures of health related quality of 
life, physical activity, cognition, social activity, and blood samples; one week sleep diary + actigraphy).  
Data on demographics and other information (age, race, education, life style (tobacco and alcohol use, 
BMI), depression, medication use (antidepressant, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sleep medication), and self-reported 
medical conditions will be assessed by [CONTACT_405592], post-intervention and follow-up. All 
source documents (questionnaires) will be collected directly from the patient using the secure web 
portal that will be developed for this study. This data will be stored in the electronic clinical trials 
software application, REDCap. This application is compliant with FDA guidelines for clinical trials 
software (e.g. data encryption, electronic signatures, and internal audit trail capabilities). The 
application and data are stored on HIPAA compliant servers. The REDCap application also can manage 
study logistics to ensure timely scheduling of study visits, supports double-data entry procedures, and 
robust data analysis features to monitor study participant recruitment and retention rates.  Physiologic 
data, such as the accelerometer data, will be uploaded, in a de-identiﬁed form (no personal identiﬁers 
except for an identiﬁcation number), to the Actiware software on a password protected laptop on a 
protected server. Data collected from the tablet will be collected in de-identiﬁed form, transmitted to the 
same University of Pennsylvania servers, where it will be stored and backed-up.  Sleep diaries will be 
completed by [CONTACT_405593], a feature of REDCap. No audio or video 
recordings will be made.
Data Management
Describe how and who manages conﬁdential data, including how and where it will be stored and 
analyzed. For instance, describe if paper or electronic report forms will be used, how corrections to the 
report form will be made, how data will be entered into any database, and the person(s) responsible for 
creating and maintaining the research database. Describe the use of pseudonyms, code numbers and 
how listing of such identiﬁers will be kept separate from the research data. 
We will apply strict procedures to maintain conﬁdentiality and will adhere to 2003 HIPAA Standards 
for Privacy of Individually Identiﬁable Health Information (the Privacy Rule). Each individual 
participant will be given a unique study identiﬁcation number in REDCap. Information linking the 
Page 10 of 26identiﬁcation number to the participant will be stored on the HIPAA compliant servers (see more below 
regarding REDCap). REDCap project access will only be granted to the research team who had been 
approved by [CONTACT_166725]. All project records not included in REDCap will reﬂect only the ID number of 
each participant. Thus, research study participants names will not appear on any forms, and instead 
participants will use a unique identiﬁcation number.  The REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) 
system will be used as a central resource for quantitative data processing and management. REDCap is 
a web application and back-end database model designed to support data capture for research studies. 
The University of Pennsylvania has licensed its own version of REDCap that is housed on our own 
password-protected servers located within a data center inside the Penn ﬁrewall and therefore afforded 
the same network protections as other sensitive clinical systems. REDCap was developed speciﬁcally 
around HIPAA-security guidelines with features such as data encryption. It provides an intuitive 
interface for data entry with data validation, audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export 
procedures, automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages, 
including SAS, and procedures for importing data from external sources. We will use standard 
operating procedures to guide all data management activities, such as the naming and identiﬁcation of 
variables, data cleaning and handling of missing data. All data obtained from self-report measures will 
be entered directly into the REDCap database on encrypted laptop computers as collected to reduce 
data collection time, increase accuracy, and prevent data loss. Data entry screens will be designed to 
incorporate range checks and concurrent checks to minimize errors. Missing ﬁelds will not be allowed.  
We will be using the Ditti application, rather than the mPhenomic platform. The new application is 
easier to use for older adults. The application does not collect personal identiﬁable information. Each 
user is assigned a randomized user ID that is only linked to the participant in REDCap. The app does 
not collect or provide any medical data. The only data collected from the app includes randomly 
generated ID for each ID, tap timestamps, and timestamps of when the app was opened. Again, there is 
no PHI or any way to link the participant to the data from the application.

Abstract
Insomnia symptoms in older adults with mild cognitive impairment represent a signiﬁcant public health 
burden in terms of impaired quality of life, risks from untreated insomnia, and risks from 
pharmaceutical insomnia treatment. To address the limitations in the most effective non-
pharmacological treatments for insomnia in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, a randomized 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_405568] a brief (4 week), tablet-based, personalized, multicomponent 
behavioral sleep intervention for insomnia, compared to a sleep education control, in this at-risk group. 
Page [ADDRESS_511235] for older adults with mild cognitive impairment to achieve better sleep and 
health-related quality of life outcomes.
Objectives
Overall objectives
1) Determine the preliminary immediate (one month) and sustained efﬁcacy (3 months) of MBSI-I 
compared to sleep education on sleep related outcomes.  2) Determine the preliminary immediate (one 
month) and sustained efﬁcacy (3 months) of MBSI-I compared to sleep education on health related 
quality of life.  3) Exploratory Aim: To explore the mechanisms by [CONTACT_405597]-I affects sleep and 
health related quality of life
Primary outcome variable(s)
Sleep latency: measured at baseline, immediately post intervention (4 weeks) and [ADDRESS_511236]-
intervention (16 weeks). Sleep latency will be derived from subjective sleep diaries and referes to the 
time it takes a person to fall asleep, starting from the ﬁrst intention to sleep. Health-related quality of 
life, measured at baseline, immediately post intervention (4 weeks) and [ADDRESS_511237]-intervention (16 
weeks). Health related quality of life is a multi-dimensional concept that includes domains related to 
physical, mental, emotional and social functioning. We will use the RAND Medical Outcomes Study 
Short Form-36 (SF-36), one of the most widely used health-related quality of life measures frequently 
used to measure HRQOL in older adults. It is a multidomain that measures physical and mental 
components of HRQOL with eight subscales. The 8 subscales contribute to two resulting component 
summaries, a mental component summary (MCS) and a physical component summary (PCS). Both 
PCS and MCS scores range from [ADDRESS_511238] health. Higher scores indicate 
better HRQOL.
Secondary outcome variable(s)
Additional sleep outcomes include wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, sleep efﬁciency, sleep 
quality and insomnia symptoms, measured with Actigraphy, sleep diary and other validated sleep 
questionnaires. These variables are measured at baseline, immediately post intervention (4 weeks) and [ADDRESS_511239]-intervention (16 weeks). We will explore the mechanisms by [CONTACT_405598]ﬂammatory 
biomarkers.
Background
Healthy sleep is critical for optimizing health related quality of life, including physical, social, 
emotional, and cognitive domains while untreated sleep disturbances can result in physical, 
psychological, social, and economical impairments. Insomnia is the most common sleep disturbance in 
older adults and is characterized by [CONTACT_405599]ﬁculty initiating or maintaining sleep, awakening too early, and 
next day consequences such as difﬁculty concentrating. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_405569] 10-40%;8 yet, less than 15% of patients with insomnia consult a 
healthcare provider or receive treatment. Furthermore, it is estimated that 7% to 20% of older adults 
have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 60% of people with MCI have some sleep disturbances. 
MCI is a degenerative condition characterized by [CONTACT_405600]; insomnia symptoms are 
bidirectionally linked to cognitive decline. Insomnia is often managed with pharmacologic agents 
which can be associated with adverse medical complications; memory impairments make treating 
insomnia even more challenging. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most widely used 
nonpharmacological treatment for insomnia and although efﬁcacious in older adults has potential 
challenges in people with MCI. Thus, it is critical to develop and test interventions that are brief and 
accessible to improve insomnia in this growing at-risk population.

ACCESS TO THE POPULATION We plan to recruit 27 participants from three sources: 1) Division of 
Geriatric Medicine Division Ralston House clinic: There are currently 2,864 active patients, with 40% 
having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), yielding a potential 1,[ADDRESS_511243] method of recruitment is on hold due to 
Covid-19. 2) PennSeek search of MCI and insomnia yielded [ADDRESS_511244] from their provider and completing a telephone screening call, consent and 
research visits will be set up via telephone or video-conferencing call. 3) Recruitment will also include 
contact[CONTACT_405601] a recruitment database (I.e., subject registry), which contains names of 
over 1000 individuals who participated in or were not eligible for study team members' previous or on-
going studies and have indicated a willingness to be contact[CONTACT_7678]. Participant 
information will be accessed via REDCap, and participants will be contact[CONTACT_405602].  ANALYSIS: Power calculation was done using PASS v21. We 
initially planned to power the study on two primary outcomes, sleep latency and health related quality 
of life and required a sample size of 40. However, given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], Covid-[ADDRESS_511245] time averaged difference of two groups in a repeated measures design for 
the primary, continuous outcome of sleep latency using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) 
approach. To estimate the necessary sample size, we assumed equal allocation between the treatment 
and control groups. The minimum time averaged difference in sleep latency between the two groups we 
were interested in detecting was set at 4.[ADDRESS_511246] size, given the work of Cassidy-Eagle et al.42 Assuming a baseline correlation r = 0.[ADDRESS_511247] over time and anticipating 20% attrition, we 
require 27 total participants in the study to achieve 80% power.

Procedures
Study Procedures: A) Subjects: The target study population is older adults with mild cognitive 
impairment who have insomnia. B) Recruitment and Screening: We will recruit 27 eligible participants 
from three sources: 1) Division of Geriatric Medicine Division Ralston House clinic (on hold due to 
Covid), 2) PennSeek, and 3) Recruitment Database. After consent, subjects will be screened for key 
inclusion criteria. First, they must answer yes to one of the insomnia screening questions and score 
within the a 28-[ADDRESS_511250] nights and/or if they are awake for more than 60 minutes during the nighttime 
period.  Next, they will receive (either by [CONTACT_405605]) actigraph device 
and a tablet to complete a sleep diary for a period of one week. Once insomnia inclusion criteria are 
conﬁrmed from the actigraph and diary data, we will contact [CONTACT_405606] 1 
via videoconference. C) Randomization: All retained participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) to 
either intervention or control arm. D) Baseline (pre-treatment) assessments, collected at Visit 1, include 
sleep measures and measures of health related quality of life, physical activity, cognition, social activity, 
and blood samples. E) Intervention: A 4-week intervention (see intervention description below) will be 
provided to subjects randomized to the intervention group. Sleep diaries will be completed and 
actigraph device worn for all four weeks of treatment, in both groups. F) Post-intervention and Follow-
up data collection (visit 2 week 5; visit 3 week 16): All baseline assessments will be repeated 
immediately post- intervention and at three months post-intervention follow-up (sleep measures and 
measures of health related quality of life, physical activity, cognition, social activity, and blood samples; 
one week sleep diary + actigraphy). G) Demographics: Data on demographics and other information 
(see measurement section) will be assessed by [CONTACT_405592], post-intervention and follow-
up.  Intervention: The intervention will include a meaningful activity protocol during the day and 
Assistive Relaxation Therapy at night. The personalized meaningful activity protocol will be developed 
based on the individuals factors contributing to insomnia, typi[INVESTIGATOR_405573]ﬁle, functional 
status, and preference for activity. The individuals typi[INVESTIGATOR_405574]ﬁle will be calculated from the 
one-week baseline accelerometer data using algorithms previously developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gooneratne (co-
mentor) and research team. The intervention will be broken into: 1) Sleep Hygiene Education, including 
content on routine, stimulus control principles, food/drink/substance intake (caffeine, alcohol, etc.), 
activity, naps, etc; 2) Meaningful Activity Modules a) Physical Activity, including content from the 
Go4Life Campaign (NIA) on endurance, strength, balance, and ﬂexibility b) Cognitive Activity 
including various cognitively stimulating games and exercises such as cross-word puzzles and c) Social 
engagement including identifying social support persons, group activities in the area and using 
technology to stay connected; 3) Assistive Relaxation Therapy (ART), a breath-based relaxation 
application that is coupled with a physical anchoring task. After reviewing baseline assessments to 
determine etiological risk factors contributing to the insomnia, each participant and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_405575]. Thus, study participants in the intervention arm will receive (1) tablet 
computer with Ditti application (for ART) and REDCap application, sleep education material, and 
meaningful activity modules; (2) Actigraph wrist watch device. They will be instructed how to use the 
tablet and encouraged to use the tablet. They will be asked to complete the daily sleep diary on the 
tablet, use the activity modules daily as pre-determined times personalized to the participant, use ART 
when they get in bed and if they awake during the night to help them with their insomnia symptoms for 
a four-week period. They will be asked to wear the actiwatch on the non-dominant wrist to monitor 
sleep/wake patterns. Participants will have weekly to biweekly phone consultation with the study 
interventionist to receive guidance and adjustment on activity plans. Based on previous research, 
Page [ADDRESS_511251] two weeks. Thus, we feel conﬁdent that a 4 week 
intervention period is sufﬁcient and justiﬁed.  As per NIH guidelines, we are providing additional 
details related to the intervention relevant for assessing Human Subjects Safety. The following 
components which will be used for the four-week intervention period. Tablet computer connected by 
[CONTACT_405607].  Tablet-enabled sleep diary: The Sleep Diary will be administered via the 
REDCap, utilizing the MyCap feature.  Sleep Education Information: Sleep education/sleep hygiene 
information will be loaded to the tablet; participants will also receive a print copy.  Meaningful Activity 
Modules: There will be three modules related to physical, social and cognitive stimulating activity. 
These will be loaded to the tablet; participants will also receive a print copy. Assisted Relaxation 
Therapy (ART) will be loaded onto the tablet via Ditti application. We will ask the study participant to 
engage in an anchoring task (ﬁnger tap) on the tablet screen at the exhalation point of the breathing 
cycle while they are lying in bed trying to sleep. Study participants will be asked to use the ART 
intervention every night as they are trying to fall asleep, or when they wake up at night. They will use it 
every night for four weeks. For ART intervention to work, it must be used on a nightly basis when in 
bed. It will be administered via the tablet. These technologies do not constitute a medical device as per 
FDA guidance related to mobile device technologies. Actiwatch Spectrum Plus: Each participant will be 
given an Actiwatch Spectrum Plus (Koninklijke Philips, N.V .), a pi[INVESTIGATOR_405576]-dominant wrist. Movement data are sampled at a rate of [ADDRESS_511252] try to fall asleep and when they get out of bed in the 
morning. The button can also be used to signal naps. Periods of activity and inactivity are analyzed in 
order to estimate sleep/wake status. Computer programs are used to derive levels of activity/inactivity, 
rhythm parameters and daytime naps. Wrist actigraphy monitoring has been shown to be a reliable way 
to objectively monitor sleep-wake cycles.  Control arm: The control arm will consist of sleep education 
materials. They will be asked to complete the tablet-enabled sleep diary and wear an actigraph device 
on the non-dominant wrist. See attached for protocol table.

Analysis Plan
Power Analysis for Sample Size described previously under "Accrual". Descriptive statistics will be 
used to characterize the sample, with measures of central tendency and variation for continuous 
measures, and frequencies and percentages for dichotomous and categorical variables. Descriptive 
estimates will be generated for all participants at each of the observed time points, and by [CONTACT_405608]. Distributional assumptions and outliers will be assessed via graphical 
approaches. Baseline characteristics between groups will be compared appropriate two sample -test or 
non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical 
variables. Primary analysis will be carried out under the intent to treat (ITT) framework. To evaluate the 
difference between groups in our primary outcome, we will utilize the GEE model with time, group, 
and group by [CONTACT_405609]. A simple exchangeable correlation structure will be used 
to model the correlation between multiple observations from the same subject. Given that GEE is less 
likely to suffer from model convergence, we changed our initial approach from mixed-model to GEE. 
GEE analysis does not require complete data over time and all available data from all subjects will be 
used in estimation. We have assumed 20% missingness in our sample size estimation. For missingness 
more than 20% we will explore imputing missing values when feasible. Given the real time data 
transmission and ability to call participants and remind them to complete sleep diary, we do not 
anticipate a great deal of missing data. We will report end of study effect sizes along with p-values and 
parameter estimates. We will construct reference cell contrasts to evaluate change relative to baseline

Data con®dentiality
Paper-based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel involved 
in the study.
xComputer-based ®les will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through the 
use of access privileges and passwords.
xPrior to access to any study-related information, personnel will be required to sign statements 
agreeing to protect the security and con®dentiality of identi®able information.
xWherever feasible, identi®ers will be removed from study-related information.
A Certi®cate of Con®dentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at 
risk of criminal or civil liability or cause damage to the subject©s ®nancial standing, 
employability, or liability.
A waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the 
subject and the study would be the consent document and the primary risk is a breach of 
con®dentiality. (This is not an option for FDA-regulated research.)
xPrecautions are in place to ensure the data is secure by [CONTACT_71994], because 
the research involves web-based surveys.
Audio and/or video recordings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible 
identi®cation of subjects.
Subject Con®dentiality
We will apply strict procedures to maintain conﬁdentiality and will adhere to 2003 HIPAA Standards 
for Privacy of Individually Identiﬁable Health Information (the Privacy Rule). Each individual 
participant will be given a unique study identiﬁcation number in REDCap. Information linking the 
identiﬁcation number to the participant will be stored on the HIPAA compliant servers (see more below 
regarding REDCap). REDCap project access will only be granted to the research team who had been 
approved by [CONTACT_166725]. All project records not included in REDCap will reﬂect only the ID number of 
each participant. Thus, research study participants names will not appear on any forms, and instead 
participants will use a unique identiﬁcation number.  To ensure HIPAA compliancy, the Ditti application 
on the tablet will be password protected and users will be given a non-identiﬁable username. This 
participant username [INVESTIGATOR_31235] (along with a password) by [CONTACT_405610]; 
they will not use their e-mail or other personal identiﬁer as the username. The Ditti application or tablet 
will not store any personal health information or a participants name, birthdate, sex, home address, or 
other personal information; it will only record tap events (time-stamped). Recorded data will be 
encrypted using standard protocols at rest and in transfer, leaving no point at which the raw data will be 
openly readable until accessed by [CONTACT_5051]. The linkage between participant ID and participant 
name [CONTACT_405626], which will be stored in REDCap as 
previously described. Rigorous security protocols that restrict data access points will also be 
implemented, requiring research staff to securely authenticate their identity before accessing the data. 
Access to the study participants identities will only be available to the immediate research staff. Data 
from Ditti will be abstracted and entered directly into REDCap.  Access to the study participants 
identities will only be available to the immediate research staff. The tablet app falls within the category 
of motivating patient behaviors, which according to the latest FDA guidance is considered within the 
category of enforcement discretion, therefore it does not require prior FDA review and approval. The 
app does not carry signiﬁcant risk to research study participants (it is not implanted and does not expose 
the body to signiﬁcant external energy for diagnostic or treatment purposes), thus it is within the 
category of FDA IDE device exemption. Prior research conducted by [CONTACT_405611]/behavioral intervention apps has been approved as an FDA IDE device exempt app. All data 
Page [ADDRESS_511254]-protected, secure server as described previously. All study data will 
be transmitted using encryption, and stored on secure servers as noted previously. The majority of data 
will be collected electronically via the REDCap system and no data will be obtained on paper. 
Information will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_405577], when published, data will be 
reported in aggregate form. As a result of aggregation, no individual participants will be identiﬁable 
from the written materials. Data will be saved for seven years and securely deleted after. The REDCap 
(Research Electronic Data Capture) system will be used as a central resource for quantitative data 
processing and management. REDCap is a web application and back-end database model designed to 
support data capture for research studies. The University of Pennsylvania has licensed its own version 
of REDCap that is housed on our own password-protected servers located within a data center inside 
the Penn ﬁrewall and therefore afforded the same network protections as other sensitive clinical 
systems. REDCap was developed speciﬁcally around HIPAA-security guidelines with features such as 
data encryption. It provides an intuitive interface for data entry with data validation, audit trails for 
tracking data manipulation and export procedures, automated export procedures for seamless data 
downloads to common statistical packages, including SAS, and procedures for importing data from 
external sources. We will use standard operating procedures to guide all data management activities, 
such as the naming and identiﬁcation of variables, data cleaning and handling of missing data. All data 
obtained from electronic medical record review and self-report measures will be entered directly into 
the REDCap database on encrypted laptop computers as collected to reduce data collection time, 
increase accuracy, and prevent data loss. Data entry screens will be designed to incorporate range 
checks and concurrent checks to minimize errors. Missing ﬁelds will not be allowed.  If tablets are lost 
or stolen, the users password can be changed on the administrative end. This will cause the account to 
automatically log-out and will require the new credentials to be input into the ﬁelds in order to access 
the Ditti user interface.

1. Consent Process
Overview
If participant is recruited via PennSeek, their provider will give us permission to contact [CONTACT_476]. If a 
person is recruited through the REDCap Subject Registry, they have already indicated it is okay for a 
researcher to contact [CONTACT_405612].  In order to ensure that the participant 
truly understands what the research study entails and that his/her participation is voluntary, 
electronically signed informed consent (HIPAA authorization will be included in the informed consent 
document) will be obtained from all patients by [CONTACT_5051]. The researcher will go over the 
informed consent document with each subject by [CONTACT_405613] e-sign using REDCap. 
Potential participants will be fully informed regarding the intensity and length of data collection 
required of them. The speciﬁc types and methods of data to be collected will be described in detail. The 
informed consent will include disclosure of the purpose and duration of the study, risks and beneﬁts, 
alternatives to participating, conﬁdentiality, and contact [CONTACT_76074] [INVESTIGATOR_405578]. The participants will be made aware that the research study is voluntary, 
and if they choose not to be in the study or to be in the study but to stop at a later date, there will be no 
penalty or loss of beneﬁts to which they are entitled. This will help to address any role conﬂict or 
coercion, so the participant does not feel he/she has to participate in the study or will otherwise lose the 
beneﬁts of the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Participants will also have the opportunity to 
think about whether or not he/she would like to participate in the study. If a participant would like more 
time, they will have the opportunity to call the researcher back to set up another appointment. In order 
to ensure that the participant truly understands what the research study entails and that his/her 
participation is voluntary, participants will be asked ﬁve questions: What is the purpose of the study? 
What are the risks to the study? What are the beneﬁts of the study? How to contact [INVESTIGATOR_048], the principle 
investigator? How to withdraw from the study? Assessing older adults capacity to provide consent is an 
important step in the informed consent process. Older adults who can verbally provide [ADDRESS_511257] chooses to consent, he/she will be sent a signed version of their consent form; a 
copy will be saved in REDCap for the research team. For older adults who have given oral assent to 
participate in the study but cannot verbally provide 4 answers correctly (demonstrating the lack of 
cognitive ability to provide consent), they will not be included in this study for two reasons. First, there 
is no caregiver component to the intervention that would permit us to use proxy-reported informed 
consent and second, this study is looking at mild cognitively impairment people that should be able to 
give informed consent if they meet the inclusion criteria of the TICS-M.

Risk / Bene®t
Potential Study Risks
We do not believe there are any major risks associated with the proposed protocol. There is minimal 
risk associated with ﬁnger pricks for blood samples, physical activity, and study burden. We will 
explain associated risk to the participants. Other potential risks to participants are fatigue from data 
collection, stress in response to self-report instruments or concerns related to conﬁdentiality. In 
addition, the participant may experience discomfort from sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_405579], but that 
usually subsides after the ﬁrst night. If the participant cannot tolerate the watch, he/she will be 
instructed that removal of the watch is allowed. Participant burden, speciﬁcally fatigue, is the most 
likely risk related to this study. To minimize fatigue during data collection, we chose only the most 
relevant self-report instruments. However, given that this is an older adult population with cognitive 
impairment; we will offer the participant the opportunity to take breaks. It is possible that some 
participants may become anxious or stressed during data collection because of the questions asked, the 
burden of data collection, or for other personal reasons. Stress is judged to be low likelihood because 
the instrument questions are not highly intrusive or sensitive. However, should this occur, the 
participant will be asked if they would like to terminate or delay data collection. Loss of conﬁdentiality 
is considered very low likelihood given the protections we will have in place and our experience in 
systems of protecting private information. Intervention: The study poses minimal risks to subjects 
beyond standard clinical care for insomnia. Sleep hygiene is a standard clinical recommendation for 
insomnia, and thus does not pose any additional risks to the subject beyond standard clinical care. 
Furthermore, the relaxation intervention component can reduce the risk of falls or daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_405580], conventional CBT-I. The tablet screen background is 
black for the sleep diary to avoid excessive light exposure at night, and the tablet screen is set to black 
when using the ART intervention in bed. The tablets are locked to prevent use of other applications.  
Plan to address risk: Finger prick via a Lancet for blood samples might result in occasional bruising, 
pain, or local reaction. All blood samples will be taken by [CONTACT_405614].  Physical Activity: In very rare occasions, the subject may fall or get injured during 
physical activities. These adverse events should be minimized by [CONTACT_405615], which will be developed/designed based on the subjects personal features by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_405581]. The activity intervention will be based on an existing NIH-funded activity 
protocol for older adults. Any occurrence of adverse events will be immediately reported to the IRB at 
the University of Pennsylvania.  Wrist watch discomfort: The subject may experience discomfort from 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_405579], but that usually subsides after the ﬁrst night. If the subject cannot 
tolerate the watch, he/she will be instructed that removal of the watch is allowed.  Fatigue: We estimate 
screening and consent to take 30 minutes, quantitative data collection 20 minutes; instructions for 
actigraphy and sleep diary 5-10 minutes; blood samples 5 minutes. We anticipate developi[INVESTIGATOR_405582] 30 minutes to one hour.  Stress: As the PI, I will be overseeing data 
collection. I am a registered nurse with a masters degree specialized in the care of older adults and a 
PhD. Thus, I am well trained to be supportive and helpful to the participants should they become 
anxious or stressed in response to survey questions. If participants do become stressed, data collection 
will be delayed to tend to the participants emotional needs. Data collection will resume if and when the 
participant is ready to proceed.
Page 25 of 26Potential Study Bene®ts
For society in general, the study offers beneﬁts in that it develops a new treatment option for insomnia 
in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, a group that has difﬁculty participating in traditional 
CBT-I and is at increased risk for side effects from pharmacotherapy for insomnia. In general, we feel 
that this study represents a minimal risk to participants. The treatments that they will undergo are 
similar to standard care for insomnia, thus pose minimal additional risk above standard medical care.  It 
is possible that while these study results may beneﬁt older adults in the future, participants in this study 
may not realize an immediate or direct beneﬁt from participating. It is also possible that the participants 
gain a heightened awareness of their sleep habits and patterns after completing the sleep diary. 
Additionally, those randomized to the intervention group may have beneﬁts from the intervention. As 
the study involves very little risk and there is signiﬁcant potential for beneﬁt, the risk / beneﬁt ratio is 
favorable.
Alternatives to Participation (optional)
The alternative to participation in the study is to decline participation and continue with routine clinical 
care for the study participants insomnia. Refusal to participate in the study will in no way adversely 
affect the clinical care the study participants would otherwise receive at the University of Pennsylvania 
Health System.
Data and Safety Monitoring
Trial monitoring will be done by a safety monitoring committee, which includes the PI, primary mentor 
([CONTACT_405632]) a statistician (Subhash Aryal) and an expert in the care of older adults (Lea Ann Matura). 
We will evaluate the progress of the study on a monthly basis, including periodic assessments of data 
quality (safety and integrity) and timeliness, recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus 
beneﬁt, and other factors that can affect study outcome; consider factors external to the study when 
relevant information becomes available, such as scientiﬁc or therapeutic developments that may have an 
impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial; review study performance; and discuss 
the resolution of problems. Furthermore, we will monitor adverse events (AEs), including serious 
adverse events (SAEs) and unanticipated problems (UPs). An Adverse Event is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. Participants will be queried regarding any changes in their health and 
medications at each contact. The informed consent document will list the daytime and after hours 
contact [CONTACT_405616]. All AE and SAE reporting will be done in 
adherence with IRB guidelines; the PI [INVESTIGATOR_405583] [ADDRESS_511258] 
the safety of the participants or the ethics of our study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_405584]. At this time, given the low risk of the intervention, there is no plan for interim analyses or any 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].

STUDY PHASE: 3  
STUDY DESIGN:  This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral ibrexafungerp (formerly “SCY-
078”) compared to placebo in female subjects [ADDRESS_1049955] of a Screening visit, an Acute Phase with open- label fluconazole and  a 
Prevention of Recurrence Phase with randomized ibrexafungerp or placebo. Screening and the 
beginning of the Acute Phase (Day -14) may occur on the same day. Approximately [ADDRESS_1049956] of 6 monthly, single- day treatment s with the randomized study drug.  
A Nested Sub -Study will be made available to subjects who fail treatment with fluconazole 
during the Acute Phase and are not eligible for randomization into the Prevention of 
Recurrence Phase (see Section 21.3 [Appendix C] for Sub-Study details). 
Study Visits  
Study visits will consist of scheduled on- site visits, pho ne contacts, and lab visits (Acute Phase 
only), as well as unscheduled visits. Whenever possible, on -site visits and phone contacts will 
be scheduled to occur on the date of dosing (or as close to the date of dosing as possible) to 
facilitate reminding sub jects to take their study doses. This is applicable for the Baseline 
(Day  1), Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 (phone contact), and Week 20 (phone contact) 
visits.  
Phone contacts will be conducted to check for AEs, treatment compliance, potential recurren ce, 
and concomitant medication use, including other antifungal agents. Unscheduled visits will be 
conducted anytime that there are symptoms indicating a potential recurrence or an AE.

PROTOCOL SCY-078-304 Version 1.0 
 
03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 • Screening (Days -16 to - 14):  To be eligible for inclusion, subjects must have a history of 
at least three epi[INVESTIGATOR_765677] 12 months (including the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]), a total 
composite score ≥ 4 on the VSS Scale, a positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) test, and a 
normal vag inal pH (≤ 4.5). Screening and the beginning of the Acute Phase (Day - 14) may 
occur on the same day. 
• Acute Phase (Days -14 to -1) : Eligible subjects will receive active treatment with open -
label oral fluconazole 150  mg administered once a day (QD) on Days -14, -[ADDRESS_1049957] diaries where they will rate their 
vulvovaginal symptoms.  
• Prevention of Recurrence Phase:  The occurrence of a recurrence is the key efficacy 
parameter in this study. Subjects who have a culture -confirmed Candida spp. infection 
from the sample collected at Screening, achieve significant resolution of their vulvovaginal signs and symptoms on fluconazole (defined as a total composite score ≤ 2 on the VSS 
Scale) at Baselin e (Day 1) and continue to meet all other eligibility criteria will be 
randomized into the Prevention of Recurrence Phase. A Nested Sub -Study will be made 
available to subjects who fail treatment with fluconazole during the Acute Phase and are not eligible for randomization into the Prevention of Recurrence Phase. Subjects who are 
not eligible for this study or the Nested Sub-Study will be discontinued. Subjects will be 
assessed for potential recurrences throughout the Study Treatment Period and the Follow -
up Period. 
o Study Treatment Period (Baseline [Day 1] through Week 24 [TOC]):  Subjects will 
be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive one of two study treatments (o ral ibrexafungerp 
or placebo administered as a single-day treatment repeated every 4 weeks [28 da ys 
(±3)] for a total of 6 single- day treatments) in a double -blind manner. Each single -day 
treatment will consist of two doses of ibrexafungerp 300  mg each or placebo given 12 
(±4) hours apart (total single -day ibrexafungerp dose = 600 mg) .  Subjects will take the 
study drug on Day 1 (Baseline), Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week [ADDRESS_1049958] diaries on a weekly basis and at the time of each scheduled or 
unscheduled visit to the site . Mycological examinations will include KOH, fungal 
culture, species identification and susceptibility testing. 
o Follow -up Period (Week 25 through Week 36 [EOFU]):  Subjects will enter the 
Follow- up Period regardless of recurrence or rescue antifungal medication use. Both 
clinical and mycological evalu ations will be completed at protocol- specified time 
points during the Follow-up Period, and anytime that a recurrence is presumed. Subjects will complete all follow- up (FU) visits regardless of recurrence or rescue 
antifungal medication use and rate their vulvovaginal symptoms in their subject diaries 
on a weekly basis until the EOFU (Week 36 visit). Subjects will continue to be evaluated for potential recurrence, antifungal medication use and safety throughout this 
period. 
Recurrences during the Prev ention of Recurrence Phase  
The occurrence of a recurrence is the key efficacy parameter in this study. Randomized 
subjects will be assessed for potential recurrence at all visits during the Prevention of

03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 Recurrence Phase following Day 1 (Baseline) (i.e., f rom Day 2 through Week 36 [EOFU]), 
including phone contacts, scheduled visits and unscheduled visits, as well as in between visits. 
If during a phone contact [CONTACT_765730][INVESTIGATOR_1884] a potential recurrence (any 
kind of recurrence, i.e., M ycologically Proven, Presumed or Suspected) , subjects will be 
instructed to visit the study center for a proper evaluation of their recurrence before initiating 
any VVC treatment. 
Potential recurrences will be assessed based on clinical and mycological out comes and need for 
other antifungal treatment. If a subject has symptoms suggestive of Candida  infection (itching, 
burning, irritation) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_765678], the 
following procedures must be completed:  
• Rate and document symptoms in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ), 
• Perform vaginal examination to rate signs and document in the eCRF ,  
• Measure vaginal pH at the site and document results in the eCRF,  
• Collect vaginal sample for KOH testing and investigation of potential bacterial vaginosis 
and Trichomonas vaginalis  infection at the site or by [CONTACT_12082], and  
• Collect vaginal samples for fungal culture by [CONTACT_2237].  
All of the procedures above should be completed prior to administration of rescue antifungal 
medication. Subjects participating in the study should be strongly discouraged from self-
administering any treatment for a potential recurrence.  Ideally, if the severity of the 
symptoms allows based on the investigator’s judgment, the initiation of antifungal therapy 
should be delayed until results from the vaginal culture are available to confirm that the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_765679]. and not to other cause of vaginitis. 
In this study, Recurrences of VVC will be broken into three c ategories:  
• Mycologically Proven Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥  3 
on the VSS Scale and a culture positive for Candida spp. that required antifungal 
treatment.  
• Presumed Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥ 3 on the VSS 
Scale that required antifungal treatment and for which there is a positive KOH microscopy but no positive fungal culture.  
• Suspected Recurrence: An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765680] (including self- administration with over -the- counter antifungals ) regardless of VSS 
composite score but for which there is no mycological evidence of disease, such as a 
positive KOH micro scopy or fungal culture.  
Subjects with a Mycologically Proven Recurrence should receive antifungal therapy.  
If a subject experiences one or more recurrences during the Study Treatment Period Phase (i.e., 
either a Mycologically Proven Recurrence or a Presumed Recurrence or a Suspected 
Recurrence) she will continue her scheduled study drug administration and will complete all scheduled visits until reaching EOFU.  
All antifungal therapy administered during the study should be documented in the electronic 
data capture ( EDC ) system , with the reason for use clearly indicated (e.g., Mycologically 
Proven Recurrence, Presumed Recurrence, Suspected Recurrence).

03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 Efficacy (Clinical, Mycological and Patient -Reported Outcomes  [QOL]) and Safety 
Assessments  
Efficacy asse ssments will be based on clinical evaluations, mycological testing and quality of 
life ( QOL ) questionnaires. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the percentage of 
subjects with documented Clinical Success (defined as subjects having a TOC evaluat ion and 
no Mycologically Proven, Presumed or Suspected Recurrences of VVC) up to TOC (Week 24).  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects with no Mycologically 
Proven Recurrence (defined as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥  3 on the VSS 
Scale and a culture positive for Candida  spp. that required antifungal treatment) at TOC (Week 
24). Efficacy will also be assessed by [CONTACT_765731]- reported outcomes 
(see STUDY ENDPOINTS above).  
Safety procedures  will include collection of AEs, treatment discontinuations, abbreviated 
physical examination, vital signs, safety laboratory tests and prior and concomitant medications.  
Clinical Evaluation  
The signs (edema, erythema and excoriation or fissures) and symp toms (itching, burning and 
irritation) of infection will be assessed by [CONTACT_27379], respectively, on the VSS Scale. The VSS Scale is a standardized, pre- defined scale where each sign and symptom 
will be given a numerical rating based on severity (absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe 
= 3) to calculate a total composite VSS score. The symptoms of infection will be rated by [CONTACT_1175] a weekly basis and at the time of each scheduled or unscheduled visit to the site 
throughout th e Prevention of Recurrence Phase. Vaginal examinations will be conducted by [CONTACT_765732]’s signs of infection at protocol -specified visits and anytime that 
there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a potential recurrence.  
Mycological Testing  
Mycologic al tests will include direct wet mount microscopic examination to visualize clue 
cells indicative of bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas, direct microscopic examination with 
10% KOH to identify yeast, and fungal cultures. The direct wet mount and KOH examination 
will be performed locally at Screening for the determination of subject eligibility and then 
anytime that a recurrence is suspected. If the investigator suspects Herpes virus, Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae  or Chlamydia trachomatis  infection, a vaginal sample will be collected and sent 
to a designated central laboratory. Fungal cultures will be performed centrally at Screening and 
at protocol -specified time points for species identification and susceptibility testing. Fungal 
cultures will also be done anytime that a recurrence is suspected during the Prevention of 
Recurrence Phase and for antifungal susceptibility testing for subjects with positive cultures.  
Quality of Life  
QOL will be assessed by [CONTACT_28973] -5D, SF-36 and FSDS at protocol-s pecified time points to assess 
improvement in QOL outcomes.  
TARGET POPULATION:  The study population will include female subjects 12 years and 
older with RVVC.  
INCLUSION CRITERIA:  
Subjects must fulfill all of the following KEY criteria at Screening and/or Baseline (Day 1) to 
be eligible for study admission:

STUDY TREATMENT GROUPS:  
Acute Phase  
Subjects who meet all study eligibility criteria at Screening will enter the Acute  Phase of the 
study and will receive oral fluconazole, as follows: 
• Oral fluconazole [ADDRESS_1049963] a culture- confirmed VVC from the sample collected at Screening, achieve a 
significant resolution of the signs and symptoms of infection (total composite sco re ≤ 2 on the 
VSS Scale) at Baseline (Day 1) and continue to meet all study eligibility criteria will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to one of the following two treatment groups:  
• Oral ibrexafungerp administered as a single-day treatment repeated every 4 weeks (28 days 
[±3]) for a total of 6 single -day treatments (Baseline [Day 1], Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, 
Week 16 and Week 20). Each single- day treatment will consist of two doses of 300 mg 
each given 12 (±4) hours apart (total single- day dose = 600 mg).  
• Matching oral placebo administered as a single- day treatment repeated every 4 weeks (28 
days [±3]) for a total of 6 single- day treatments  (Baseline [Day 1], Week 4, Week 8, Week 
12, Week 16 and Week 20). Each single- day treatment will consist of two doses of placebo 
given 12 (±4) hours apart. 
Subjects will receive their first dose of double -blind study drug at the site and will self-
administer the remaining doses at home. Subjects must  take the two doses of study drug 12 
hours apart (±4 hours), preferably with or immediately after a meal.   
STUDY BLINDING, RANDOMIZATION AND STRATIFICATION:   This is a 
randomized, double -blind study. All site and sponsor personnel will be blinded to treatment 
assignment.  
Approximately 320 subjects are planned to be enrolled into the open- label Acute Phase of the 
study in order to randomize approximately 240 subjects at a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study 
treatment groups. All randomization of subjects will be managed electronically through an interactive web response system (IWRS).

STUDY EVALUATIONS  
Clinical Evaluation: The signs (edema, erythema and excoriation or fissures) and symptoms 
(itching, burning and irritation) of infection will be assessed by [CONTACT_27379], 
respectively, on the VSS Scale. The VSS Scale is a standardized, predefined scale where each 
sign and symptom will be given a numerical rating based on severity (absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3) to calculate a total composite score.  
Mycological Testing: M yc
 ological tests will include direct wet mount microscopic 
examination to visualize clue cells indicative of bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas, direct microscopic examination with 10% KOH to identify yeast, and fungal cultures.  
QOL : QOL will be assessed by [CONTACT_28973] -
 5D, SF-36 and FSDS at protocol- specified time points to 
assess i mprovement in QOL outcomes. 
Safety Evaluations: S afety will be evaluated throughout the study, including the following 
parameters: AEs, physical examination, vital signs, safety laboratory tests and study treatment 
discontinuations. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
Sample Size Determination  
The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with documented Clinical 
Success up to TOC (Week 24). Assuming response rates of 65% and 43% for ibrexafungerp 
and placebo, respectively; 90% power; and an alpha level of 0.05, approximately 240 subjects 
randomized at a 1:1 ratio are needed to declare a difference between ibrexafungerp and placebo 
at Week 24 based on Fisher’s Exact test.  
In order to be randomized, a subject should have achieved the proposed significant resolution of signs and symptoms (total composite score ≤2 on the VSS Scale) after receiving fluconazole 
therapy for an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_765684] a positive culture for Candida spp. from the sample 
collected at Screening. It is estimated that approximately [ADDRESS_1049964] been randomized.  
Analysis Populations 
The study populations to be used in the analyses are defined as follows: 
• I
ntent- to-Treat (ITT) Population : All randomized subjects.  
• Modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT) Population : All randomized subjects who have a 
confirmed mycological culture for yeast at Screening and a negative culture for yeast 
at Baseline (Day 1).  
• Per- Protocol (PP) Population: All ITT subjects who did not have major protocol 
deviations likely to affect study efficacy and who have available data at the TOC visit.  Note that subjects who discontinue due to a study-drug- related AE  will be classified as 
failures for the analyses of efficacy under the PP population.  
• Safety Population :
  All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug (ibrexafungerp or placebo) and who have at least one post -Baseline (Day 1) 
evaluation.

03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy assessments will be based on clinical evaluations, mycological testing and QOL.  
The primary efficacy endpoint  of the study is the percentage of subjects with documented 
Clinical Suc cess (defined as subjects having a TOC evaluation and no Mycologically Proven, 
Presumed or Suspected Recurrences of VVC) up to TOC (Week 24).  The key secondary 
efficacy endpoint  is the percentage of subjects with no Mycologically Proven Recurrence 
(define d as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥ 3 on the VSS Scale and a culture 
positive for Candida spp. that required antifungal treatment) at TOC (Week 24). Other 
secondary efficacy endpoints  will also be assessed (see STUDY ENDPOINTS above).  
The following efficacy outcomes will be evaluated in the study: 
• Clinical Success : Subjects having a TOC evaluation and no Mycologically Proven, 
Presumed or Suspected Recurrences of VVC.  
• Recurrence of VVC : In this study, Recurrence of VVC will be broken into three 
categories:  
o Mycologically Proven Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite 
score ≥ 3 on the VSS Scale and a culture positive for Candida spp. that required 
antifungal treatment.   
o Presumed Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composi te score ≥ 3 on 
the VSS Scale that required antifungal treatment and for which there is a positive 
KOH microscopy but no positive fungal culture. 
o Suspected Recurrence: An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765685] (including self -administration with over -the-counter antifungals ) 
regardless of VSS composite score but for which there is no mycological evidence 
of disease, such as a positive KOH microscopy or fungal culture.  
• Mycological Eradication: Negative fungal culture (no growth of Candida species).  
The primary endpoint, the percentage of subjects with documented Clinical Success up to TOC 
(Week 24), will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted for site; p -
values and 95% c onfidence intervals will be presented. Subjects whose results are missing at 
TOC (Week 24) will be imputed as failures in the analysis. In the event that model 
convergence is an issue with a stratified analysis, alternative methods for accounting for site,  or 
an unstratified analysis will be considered. A sensitivity analysis will be performed on the ITT population where subjects with missing values will be removed from the analysis.  
For other continuous efficacy endpoints, a two- way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model will 
be used including effects for treatment and site; p -values and 95% confidence intervals will be 
presented. For other categorical endpoints, the CMH test adjusted for site will be performed, 
and p- values and 95% confidence interv als will be presented.  
For the ordered categorical endpoint, a proportional odds model will be fitted accounting for the effects of treatment and site.  The proportional odds model will fit an ordered regression 
model for the ordinal dependent variable as described by [CONTACT_765733] (1980).  If the assumption 
of proportional odds is violated alternative analyses will be considered which require a weaker assumption.  
Safety Analysis 
Safety will be evaluated throughout the study, including the following parameters: AEs, study 
treatment discontinuations, vital signs, safety laboratory tests and prior and concomitant

7.1 Background Information  
Vulvovaginal Candidiasis 
Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common fungal infection caused by [CONTACT_27383]. and is a 
significant morbidity condition in women from all social classes . 
Information on the incidence of VVC  is incomplete, since the disease is not a reportable entity 
and data collection is hampered by [CONTACT_27384]- representative 
study populations.1 VVC affects 70 %–75% of women at least once during their lives, most 
frequently young women of childbearing age. Approximately 40%–50% of women will 
experience a recurrence2 and 5% to 8 % of adult women have a recurrent vulvovaginal 
candidia sis (RVVC) .[ADDRESS_1049965] ’s hyperactive local immune response.  Long-
term antifungal suppressive therapy may help control the host ’s mucosal reaction by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_765686].4 Several long -term maintenance regimens using 
either topi[INVESTIGATOR_765687] (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole) have been 
studied showing benefit in preventing recurrences of VVC. Alt hough there have been few 
comparative studies, the best results were obtained with long-term maintenance therapy using once weekly fluconazole [ADDRESS_1049966] important limitation of the 
suppressive therapy with flu conazole is exactly that: suppression of growth rather than  
eradication of the yeast. Even though yeast organisms are dramatically reduced in number, below the level of detection by [CONTACT_765734], they persist in low numbers in the vaginal lumen , triggering the VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_765688]. A fungicidal 
drug and regimen may be able to address this significant limitation of current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_765689] a more sustained benefit after discontinuation of therapy.   
This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy and define the safety of a 6 -month dosing regimen of 
oral ibrexafungerp to prevent recurrences in subjects with RVVC. 
The glucan synthesis inhibitor ibrexafungerp   
Ibrexafungerp ( SCY -078) is a member of a new class of antifungal agents and is an orally active, 
semi -synthetic, triterpene derivative of the natural product enfumafungin. Ibrexafungerp is a 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1049967] class of glucan synthesis inhibitor that inhibits the synthesis of the fungal cell 
wall polymer β -(1,3)-D- glucan.  Time -kill studies have demonstrated that ibrexafungerp has in 
vitro fungicidal activity against Candida spp. isolates similar to that observed with the 
echinocandins.  
Ibrexafungerp is being developed as the first oral and intravenous (IV) glucan synthesis inhibitor 
for the treatment and prevention of fungal infections caused by [CONTACT_765735].  
Antifun gal activity 
The spectrum and potency of activity of ibrexafungerp has been evaluated by [CONTACT_765736] (M27-A3 guidelines)
[ADDRESS_1049968] > [ADDRESS_1049969] shown that ibrexafungerp retains activity (i.e., no significant change in minimum inhibitory concentration when compared to wild type) against > 90% of azole- resistant strains and >  70% of Candida strains with FKS 
mutations commonly associated with echinocandin resistance. Interestingly, although ibrexafungerp and the echinocandins share a similar mechanism of action (β -[1,3]-D-glucan 
synthesis inhibition), their clearly different molecular structure provides them with some differentiating characteristics in terms of microbiological activity.  
Ibrexafungerp was evaluated in vitro against clinical is olates of echinocandin- resistant strains of 
Candida spp., the majority  of which contained mutations in the FKS gene. Overall, it was active 
against the majority of the echinocandin- resistant strains tested. Significantly, ibrexafungerp was 
active against approximately 70% of the isolates containing the most commonly reported FKS 
mutation associated with echinocandin resistance in C. glabrata (S663P in FKS2  and S645P in 
FKS1 ). Selection of ibrexafungerp resistance in vitro occurs at a low frequency. A deletion at 
position F659 in FKS2  of C. glabrata was the predominant mutation observed in these studies; 
notably, ibrexafungerp did not select for mutations at positions S663 or S645. These results suggest that ibrexafungerp in hibits glucan synthase in a manner different from that of 
echinocandins.  
The in vitro studies also included several multidrug- resistant isolates. Consistent with the data 
described above, ibrexafungerp was active against > 70% of these isolates. I brexafun gerp has 
also demonstrated a potent activity against life -threatening and multi-drug- resistant C. auris 
strains at concentrations indicative of potential clinically relevant effect s.  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1049970] > [ADDRESS_1049971] all of the strains tested.  
Murine models of invasive fungal infections  
The antifungal efficacy of ibrexafungerp has been evaluated in several murine models of 
disseminated candidiasis and aspergillosis. In a disseminated C. albicans model, ibrexafungerp was more active than fluconazole at all doses. Murine models of ibrexafungerp  in disseminated 
candidiasis caused by C.  glabrata and C. tropi[INVESTIGATOR_765690]. The ibrexafungerp area under the concentration -time curve  in plasma necessary to 
achieve target efficacy in these models was estimated to be 15.4 ± 2.2 μM•hr. 
Nonclinical experience  
Toxicology studies in rats and dogs have been conducted with ibrexafungerp following oral 
administration for 6 and 9 months, respec tively . The results from the non- clinical safety program 
are supportive of the doses and treatment duration intended in this study.  
The in vitro studies indicated that ibrexafungerp metabolism was predominantly oxidative, with 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A being the primary enzyme involved in its oxidative metabolism. 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A would be expected to increase plasma levels of ibrexafungerp; therefore, the concurrent administration of ibrexafungerp with such inhibitors is prohibited.  
Clinical experience  
To date, over [ADDRESS_1049972] received either oral or IV formulations of 
ibrexafungerp in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. Ibrexafungerp was generally well tolerated 
following single oral doses of up to 1600 mg and multiple oral doses of up to 800 mg/day for 28 consecutive days in Phase 1 studies. Reported adverse events (AEs) after oral administration have been generally transient and prim arily mild to moderate in intensity. The most frequently 
reported AEs have been mild gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain).  
A Phase [ADDRESS_1049973] common treatment -related 
AEs being gastrointestinal in nature (i.e., nausea and diarrhea). The results from this study also indicated that the higher dose of ibrexafungerp tested (750 mg once a day [ QD]) is predicted to 
achieve the target exposure at steady stat e in the majority of patients.  
A Phase 2 proof- of-concept study of oral ibrexafungerp  in patients with acute VVC has also been 
completed. In this multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, evaluator-blinded study of oral ibrexafungerp compared to oral fl uconazole in adult female patients with acute VVC, 96 patients 
with an acute, moderate to severe, symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_765691]  a 1:1:[ADDRESS_1049974] common AEs

03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 being mild gastrointestinal events. The high clinical cure rates observed in this study are 
supportive of the clinically relevant antifungal activity of ibrexafungerp in this form of Candida infection.  
In addition, a Phase 2  study to c ompare the s afety and efficacy of oral ibrexafungerp vs. o ral 
fluconazole in s ubjects with acute VVC (DOVE) has been completed . The primary objective of 
the study was dose selection for our Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_742691]. This Phase 2b study was a 
randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, dose-finding study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of five dosing regimens of oral ibrexafungerp in patients with moderate -to-severe (defined as a signs and symptoms score of 7 or 
greater)  acute VVC , with oral fluconazole as a reference arm. The study enrolled a total of 186 
patients and 153 patients were included in the culture-confirmed, modified intent- to-treat 
population.  The study was not intended, nor powered, to achieve statistically significant differences in any of the evaluated endpoints. The total doses tested ranged from 600 mg to 1800 mg and the dosing durations explored were 1 or 3 days. The maximum duration of treatment of 3 days was based on a previous Phase 2a study, in which we showed that 3 days of treatment performed similarly to 5 days, so in the DOVE study we explored 3 days and a shorter treatment duration. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical cure, defined as complete resolution of all signs and 
symptoms at the Day 10 ( Test of Cure [TOC ]) visit without the need of additional antifungal 
therapy. Secondary endpoints included mycological eradication and composite endpoints including both clinical cure and mycological eradication. In this Phase [ADDRESS_1049975] combination of attributes for this indication is the ibrexafungerp 600 mg dose administered as 300 mg twice a day ( BID) for 1 day .  
At Day 10, the TOC  visit, the  ibrexafungerp 600 mg dose showed clinical and mycological 
response rates in line with the reference fluconazole arm.  Specifically, clinical cure was reported in 14 of 27 (52%) patients in the ibrexafungerp 600 mg dose arm and in 14 of 24 (58%) patients in the fluconazole arm.  The percentage of patients showing a signs and symptoms score of 0 or 1 was also comparable, with 70% and 71% patients reporting this improvement in the ibrexafungerp 600 mg dose and fluconazole arms, respectively. The mycological eradication at this time point was 63% for both groups. 
At Day 25, the follow-up (FU) visit, the ibrexafungerp  [ADDRESS_1049976] signs and symptoms of VVC at the TOC visit or later, rescue antifungal medication could be prescribed. Seven patients treated with fluconazole received rescue antifungal medication, whereas one patient treated with ibrexafungerp 600 mg received rescue 
antifungal medication. The rate of patients with no signs and symptoms (score = 0) at the FU visit was 70% for the ibrexafungerp 600 mg dose versus 50% for the fluconazole arm. A s imilar 
difference was observed when performing the analysis using a signs and symptoms score of 0 or 
1, where this improvement was achieved by 81% of the subjects receiving ibrexafungerp 600 mg

03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 dose versus 58% of the subjects receiving fluconazole. This demonstrates sustained symptom 
relief for at least 25 days and  supports the monthly dosing proposed in this study  
The oral ibrexafungerp  600 mg dose was generally well tolerated, with self -limiting (generally 
one-day duration), mild to moderate gastrointestinal AEs being the most commonly reported. Nausea was report ed in three (10%) s ubjects  in the ibrexafungerp 600 mg dose arm compared to 
two (6%) subjects in the fluconazole arm. Diarrhea and loose stool were reported in five (17%) 
subjects in the ibrexafungerp 600 mg dose arm compared to one (3%) subject in the fluconazole arm. Abdominal pain was reported in one (3%) subject in the ibrexafungerp 600 mg dose arm 
compared to 5 (16%) subjects in the fluconazole arm. No vomiting, severe AEs or discontinuations due to AE s were reported in the ibrexafungerp [ADDRESS_1049977] been conducted. Ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of 
CYP3A) induces a significant (5- fold) increase in ibrexafungerp exposure, while diltiazem (a 
moderate inhibitor of CYP3A) induces a mild to moderate (< 3- fold) increase in ibrexafungerp 
exposure. Ibrexafungerp did not have any effect on rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) exposure, had only a mild effect (less than a 0.5-fold increase) on the area under the curv e of tacrolimus (a 
CYP3A and P-glycoprotein [P-gp] substrate) and had no effect on the maximum concentration (C
max) of tacrolimus.  
Ibrexafungerp has the potential to be an important addition to the antifungal treatment arsenal by [CONTACT_742709], including difficult- to-treat 
organisms, and by [CONTACT_765737].

In this  study, oral ibrexafungerp will be administered as a single- day treatment repeated every 4 
weeks (28 days [±3]) for a total of [ADDRESS_1049981] of two doses of 300 mg each given 12 (±4) hours apart (total single-day dose = 600 mg). This dose level is the dose level used in the Phase 2b DOVE study in acute VVC, which was 
shown to be effective in achieving high clinical cure and mycological eradication rates . This 
dose level  will be administer ed once every 4 weeks (28 days [±3]) for a total of [ADDRESS_1049982]  that, in the 
DOVE study, the selected dose showed a sustained clinical benefit with high cure rates for up to 25 days ( last follow -up).   
7.2.3 Rationale for Study Endpoints and Efficacy Outcomes 
In this study, recurrent VVC will be broken into three categories:  
• Mycologically Proven Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥ 3 
on the VSS Scale and a culture positive for Candida spp. that required antifungal treatment.  
• Presumed Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥ 3 on the VSS 
Scale that required antifungal treatment and for which there is a positive KOH microscopy but no positive fungal culture.  
• Suspected Recurrence: An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765692]  (including self- administration with over -the-counter antifungals) regardless of VSS 
composite score but for which  there is no mycological evidence of disease, such as a 
positive potassium hydroxide ( KOH) microscopy or fungal culture.  
The primary endpoint of the study will be the percentage of subjects with documented Clinical 
Success (defined as subjects having a TOC evaluation and no Mycologically Proven, Presumed or Suspected  Recurrence of VVC)  up to TOC (Week 24).  This criterion is meant to reflect real 
world practice, where patients may self -treat, and apply scientific rigor in assigning subjects with 
signs and symptoms of disease, regardless of culture result or missing data, as failures.  
The key secondary endpoint will be the percentage of subjects with no Mycologically Proven 
Recurrence at TOC (Week 24). The key secondary endpoint is based on recurrences that are symptomatic and required antifungal therapy. This  criteri on is  aimed at reflecting the highest 
level of certainty in the diagnosis of a recurrence in  a symptomatic subject seek ing medical 
treatment. This endpoint is anticipated to objectively demonstrate the antifungal activity of ibrexafungerp. 
These endpoints are considered appropriate t o identify the key clinical benefit intended with this 
preventive regimen.

10.0 Study Design  
10.1 Overall Description of the Study  
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral ibrexafungerp (formerly “ SCY -078”) compared to 
placebo in female subjects 1 2 years and older with RVVC . The primary objective of the study is 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1049983] of a Screening visit, an Acute Phase with open- label fluconazole and a 
Prevention of Recurrence Phase with randomized ibrexafungerp or placebo. Screening and the beginning of the Acute Phase (Day -14) may occur on the same day. Approximately [ADDRESS_1049984] of 6 monthly, single-day treatments with randomized  study drug.  
A Nested Sub -Study will be made available to subjects who fail treatment with fluconazole  
during the Acute Phase and are not eligible for randomization into the Prevention of Recurrence Phase  (s ee Section 21.3 [Appendix C] for Sub-Study details). 
A summary of study visits is provided below. Further details of the study visits are provided in Section 10.1.1. 
• Screening  (Days -16 to -14) :  To be eligible for inclusion, subjects must have a history of 
at least three epi[INVESTIGATOR_765677] 12 months (including the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]), a total composite score ≥ 4 on the VSS Scale, a positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) test, and a normal vaginal pH (≤ 4.5). Screening and the beginning of the Acute Phase (Day -14) may occur on the same day. 
• Acute Phase (Days -14 to -1) : Eligible subjects will receive active treatment with open-
label oral fluconazole 150 mg , administered QD on Days -14, - 11 and -8, for a total of 3 
doses.  
• Prevention of Recurrence Phase:  The occurrence of a recurrence is the key efficacy 
parameter in this study. Subjects who have a culture-confirmed Candida spp. infection from the sample collected at Screening, achiev e significant resolution of their 
vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (defined as a total composite score ≤ 2 on the VSS Scale) at Baseline (Day 1) and continue to meet all other eligibility criteria will be randomized into the Prevention of Recurrence Phase. Subjects who are not eligible for this study or the Nested Sub-Study will be discontinued. Subjects will be assessed for potential recurrences throughout the Study Treatment Period and the Follow-up Period.  
o Study Treatment Period  (Baseline [Day 1] through Week 24 [ TOC ]): Subjects will 
be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive one of two study treatments (oral ibrexafungerp 
or placebo administered as a single-day treatment repeated every 4 weeks [28 days (±3)] for a total of 6 single-day treatments) in a double-blind manner. Each single-day treatment will consist of two doses of ibrexafungerp 300 mg each or placebo given 12 (±4) hours apart (total single-day ibrexafungerp dose = 600 mg).  Subjects will take the 
study drug on Day 1 (Baseline), Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and Week 20, regardless of recurrence or administration of antifungal medication. Subjects will be evaluated for potential recurrence, antifungal medication use and safety throughout this period. 
o Follow- up Period  (Week 2 5 through Week 36 [ EOFU ]): Subjects will enter the 
Follow- up Period regardless of recurrence or rescue antifungal medication use. 
Subjects will continue to be evaluated for potential recurrence, antifungal medication use and safety throughout this period.

03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 Efficacy  and Safety  
Efficacy  will be determined primarily by [CONTACT_765738]  (defined as subjects having a TOC evaluation and no Mycologically Proven, Presumed 
or Suspected recurrence of VVC ) up to TOC (Week 24). The key secondary endpoint will be the 
percentage of subjects with no Mycologically Proven Recurrence (defined as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_765694] a total composite score ≥  3 on VSS Scale and a culture positive for Candida spp. that 
required antifungal treatment) at TOC (Week 24). Efficacy will also be assessed by [CONTACT_765731] -reported outcomes (see Section  9.3).  
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study by [CONTACT_89944]: AEs, treatment discontinuations, vital signs and safety laboratory tests at TOC (Week 24) .  
 
A summary description of the study visits and assessments is provided below. A schematic of the 
study desi gn is available in Section 6.0. D etailed description s of study treatments and procedures  
are provided in Section  12.[ADDRESS_1049985] of scheduled on-site visits, phone contacts, and lab visits (Acute Phase only), as well as  unscheduled visits. Whenever possible, on-site visits and phone contacts will be 
scheduled to occur on the date of dosing (or as close to the date of dosing as possible ) to 
facilitate reminding subjects to  take their study doses. This is applicable for the Baseline (Day 1), 
Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 (phone contact), and Week 20 (phone contact) visits.  
If a subject is actively menstruating at an on -site study visit that requires a vaginal exam , the visit 
should be rescheduled as soon as the subject’s period ends but in no case more than 7 days after 
the initially scheduled visit.  
Phone contacts will be conducted to check for AEs, treatment compliance, potential recurrence, and concomitant medication use, including other antifungal agents. Unscheduled visits will be conducted anytime that there are symptoms indicating a potential recurrence or an AE. 
Subjects will be instructed to visit the study center for a proper evaluation of any potential 
recurrence before initiating any VVC treatment. Subjects pa rticipating in the study will be 
strongly discouraged from self- administering any treatment for a potential recurrence.  
An electronic dosing reminder system (e.g. text message) may be implemented for consenting subjects to facilitate study drug dosing compliance.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening (Days -16 to  -14) 
At Screening, subjects who are experiencing vulvovaginal symptoms will be evaluated by [CONTACT_093], who will obtain a vulvovaginal sample for local KOH testing and vaginal pH determination prior to initiation of open- label fluconazole treatment. The vaginal samples will 
also be tested for fungal culture, species identification and susceptibility testing by [CONTACT_2237], as well as to rule out other potential pathogens. The investigators and the subjects will rate the signs and symptoms of infection, respectively, on a standardized VSS Scale. Safety

[EOFU]) 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Study Treatment Period (Day 1 [Baseline] through Week 24 [TOC])   
Baseline (Day 1) 
On Day 1, subjects will return their open -label fluconazole supplies . Treatment compliance will 
be evaluated,  and subject diaries will be collected and  reviewed. Vulvovaginal samples will be 
collected for fungal culture and pH. The investigator and the subject will rate the signs and 
symptoms of infection, respectively, on the VSS Scale. The subject’s QOL questionnaires will be administered . The results of the vaginal culture collected at Screening will be reviewed.  
Subjects wi th a culture-confirmed Candida spp. infection from the sample collected at Screening 
who achieve a significant resolution of their vulvovaginal signs and symptoms ( total composite 
score ≤  2 on the VSS Scale ) and continue to meet all study eligibility  crite ria at Baseline ( Day 1 ) 
will continue to the Prevention of Recurrence Phase, where they will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following t wo study treatments in a double-blind manner: 
• Oral ibrexafungerp administered as a single- day treatment repeated every 4 weeks (28 
days [±3]) for a total of 6 single- day treatments  (Baseline [Day 1], Week 4, Week 8, Week 
12, Week 16 and Week 20). Each single-day treatment will consist of two doses of 300 mg each given 12 (±4) hours apart (total single -day dose = 600 mg).  
• Matching oral placebo administered as a single- day treatment repeated every 4 weeks (28 
days [±3]) for a total of 6 single- day treatments (Baseline [Day 1], Week 4, Week 8, Week

PROTOCOL SCY-078-304 Version 1.0 
03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 12, Week 16 and Week 20). Each single- day treatment will consist of two doses of 
placebo given 12 (±4) hours apart.  
Subjects will receive their first dose of study drug at the site and will be dispensed double-blind 
study drug and subject diaries, where they will rate their vulvovaginal symptoms on a weekly basis and at the time of each visit to the site, and will record dosing details, AEs and concomitant medication use during the study. Safety procedures (abbreviated physical exam, vital signs, AE collection and urine pregnancy test) will be conducted.  
Subjects who do not have a culture -confirmed Candida spp. infection at Screening, do not 
achieve a significant resolution of their signs and symptoms at Baseline ( Day 1 ) and/or do not 
continue to meet all eligibility  criteria  will be discontinued from the study.  
A Nested Sub -Study wil l be made available to  subjects who fail treatment with fluconazole 
during the Acute Phase and are not eligible for randomization into the Prevention of Recurrence Phase  (see Section  21.3, Appendix C for details about the Sub-Study).  
Day 2 through Week 23 
On-site study visits will be scheduled at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 and phone contacts will be 
conducted on Weeks 16 and 20 to check for potential recurrence, treatment compliance and antifungal medication use. During this period, subjects will self -administer their double-blind 
study drug at home. Study drug will be taken as a single-day t reatment repeated every 4 weeks 
(28 days [±3]) for a total of 6 single- day treatments (i.e., at  Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 
and Week 20), regardless of recurrence or administration of antifungal medication, preferably with or immediately after a meal.  
Subjects will be assessed for potential recurrence at all visits during the Study Treatment Period following Baseline (Day 1), including phone contacts, scheduled visits and unscheduled visits. Anytime that there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a recurrence (Mycologically Proven, Presumed or Suspected
), 
all procedures for the assessment of the recurrence must be completed (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3 for 
an overview and Section  14.18 for detailed procedures ). Subjects participating in the study 
will be s trongly discouraged from self-administering any treatment for a potential 
recurrence.  Subjects will be instructed to visit the study center for a proper evaluation of their 
recurrence before initiating any VVC treatment.  
At Week 12, an abbreviated physical exam will be performed, blood samples will be drawn for safety laboratory tests  and vulvovaginal samples will be collected for fungal culture and 
susceptibility testing  by [CONTACT_2237] . The investigator and the subject will rate the 
signs and symptoms of infection, respectively, on the VSS Scale. Subjects will complete their  
QOL questionnaires. Subjects will return their empty bottle s of study drug and new bottle 
supplies will be provided. Subject diaries will be collected, reviewed and dispensed. 
Subjects will continue rating their vulvovaginal symptoms on a weekly basis and at the time of 
each scheduled or unscheduled visit to the site on their subject diaries and recording dosing details, AEs and concomitant medication use. AEs, concomita nt medication use, treatment 
compliance and potential recurrence will be assessed at each study visit, including phone contacts. Subject diaries will be reviewed and vital signs will be determined at all on- site visits.

During the FU  Period, an  on-site study visit will be scheduled at Week 36 (EOFU) and phone 
contacts will be conducted at Weeks [ADDRESS_1049990] be completed (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3 for an overview and Section  14.18 for detailed proced ures). Subjects 
participating in the study will be strongly discouraged from self-administering any treatment for a potential recurrence.  Subjects will be instructed to visit the study center for a 
proper evaluation of their recurrence before initiating any VVC treatment.  
At the EOFU (Week 36) visit, vaginal samples will be obtained for fungal culture and for antifungal susceptibility testing by [CONTACT_2237]. Subjects will complete their QOL questionnaires and subject diaries will be reviewed and collected. Safety procedures (vital signs, AEs, and concomitant medication use) will be performed. Blood samples will be drawn if needed to follow up on a laboratory abnormality.  
Subjects will continue to complete all FU visits regardless of recurrence or  antifungal medication 
use.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Recurrence During the Prevention of Recurrence Phase  
The occurrence of a recurrence is the key efficacy parameter in this study. Randomized subjects 
will be assessed for potential recurrence at all visits during the Prevention of Recurrence Phase following Day 1 (Baseline) (i.e., from Day 2 through Week 36 [EOFU]), including phone contacts, scheduled visits and unscheduled visits, as well as in between visits. If during a phone contact [CONTACT_765730][INVESTIGATOR_1884] a potential recurrence (any kind of recurrence, i.e., Mycologically Proven, Presumed or Suspected) , subjects will be instructed to visit the study 
center for a proper evaluation of their recurrence before initiating any VVC treatment . 
Potential recurrences will be assessed based on clinical and mycological outcomes and need for other antifungal treatment. If a subject has symptoms suggestive of Candida infection (itching, burning, irritation) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_765678], the following procedures must be completed: 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,521 
PROTOCOL SCY-078-304 Version 1.0 
03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 • Rate and document symptoms in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ), 
• Perform vaginal examination to rate signs and document in the eCRF,  
• Measure vaginal pH at the site and document results in the eCRF,  
• Collect vaginal sample for KOH testing and investigation of potential bacterial vaginosis 
and Trichomonas vaginalis  infection at the site or by [CONTACT_12082], and  
• Collect vaginal samples for fungal culture by [CONTACT_2237].  
All of the procedures above should be completed prior to administration of rescue antifungal medication. Subjects participating in the study should be strongly discouraged from self-administering any treatment for a potential recurrence. Ideally, if the severity of the symptoms 
allows based on the investigator’s judgment, the initiation of antifungal therapy should be delayed until results from the vaginal culture are available  to confirm that the epi[INVESTIGATOR_765695]. and not to other cause of vaginit is.   
See Section  14.18 for a detailed description of procedures to be completed for potential 
recurrences.  
In this study, Recurrences of VVC will be broken into t hree categories:  
• Mycologically Proven Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥ 3 
on the VSS Scale and a culture positive for Candida spp. that required antifungal treatment.  
• Presumed Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥ 3 on the VSS 
Scale that required antifungal treatment and for which there is a positive KOH microscopy but no positive fungal culture.  
• Suspected Recurrence: An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765680] (including self- administration with over -the-counter antifungals ) regardless of VSS 
composite score but for which there is no mycological evidence of disease, such as a 
positive KOH microscopy or fungal culture.  
Subjects with a Mycologi cally Proven Recurrence should receive antifungal therapy.  
If a subject experiences one or more recurrences during the Study Treatment Period Phase (i.e., either a Mycologically Proven Recurrence, a Presumed Recurrence or a Suspected Recurrence), she will continue her scheduled study drug administration and will complete all scheduled visits until reaching EOFU. 
All antifungal therapy administered during the study should be documented in the electronic data 
capture ( EDC ) system , with the reason for use cle arly indicated ( i.e., Mycologically Proven 
Recurrence, Presumed Recurrence, Suspected Recurrence).  
10.1.2  Study  Assessments 
The s tudy will include efficacy , safety  and tolerability assessments. 
Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy assessments will be based on clinical evaluations, mycological testing and QOL. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with documented Clinical Success (defined as subjects having a TOC evaluation and no Mycologically Proven, Presumed 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,521 
PROTOCOL SCY-078-304 Version 1.0 
03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 or Suspected  Recurrence of VVC) up to TOC (Week 24).  The key secondary efficacy endpoint 
is the percentage of subjects with no Mycologically Proven Recurrence (defined as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_765696] a total composite score ≥  3 on the VSS Scale and a culture positive for Candida spp. 
that required antifungal treatment) at TOC (Week 24) . Efficacy will also be assessed by [CONTACT_765739] -reported outcomes (see Section  9.3).  
Clinical Evaluation s  
The signs (edema, erythema and excoriation or fissures) and symptoms (itching, burning and irritation) of infection will be assessed by [CONTACT_27379], respectively, on the VSS Scale ( provided in Appendix B ). The VSS Scale is a standardized, predefined scale where 
each sign and symptom will be given a numerical rating based on severity (absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3) to calculate a total composite VSS score.  The symptoms of infection 
will be  rated by [CONTACT_1175] a weekly basis and at the time of each scheduled or unscheduled 
visit to the site throughout the Prevention of Recurrence Phase. Vaginal examinations will be conducted by [CONTACT_765740]’s signs of infection at protocol- specified visits 
and anytime that there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a potential recurrence. 
Mycological Testing 
Mycological tests will include direct wet mount microscopic examination to visualize clue cells 
indicative of bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas, direct microscopic examination with 10% KOH to identify yeast, and fungal cultures. The direct wet mount and KOH examination will be performed locally at Screening for the determination of subject eligibility and then anytime that a recurrence is suspected . 
If the investigator  suspects Herpes virus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae  or 
Chlamydia trachomatis  infection, a vaginal sample  will be collected and sent to a designated central 
laboratory. Fungal cultures will be performed centrally at Screening and at protocol- specified 
time points for species identification and susceptibility testing . Fungal cultures will also be done 
anytime that a recurrence is suspected during the Prevention of Recurrence Phase and for antifungal susceptibility testing for subjects with positive cultures.  
Quality of Life  
QOL will be assessed by [CONTACT_28973] -5D, SF-36 and FSDS at protocol- specified time points to assess 
improvement in QOL outcomes. Safety Assessments  
Safety procedures will include collectio n of AEs, treatment discontinuations, abbreviated 
physical examination, vital signs, safety laboratory tests and prior and concomitant medications. 
10.2 Blinding, Randomization and Stratification  
This is a randomized, double-blind study. All site and sponsor personnel will be blinded to 
treatment assignment. 
Approximately 320 subjects are planned to be enrolled into the open- label Acute Phase of the 
study in order to randomize approximately 240 subjects at  a 1:1 ratio  to one of the two study 
treatment groups. Al l randomization of subjects will be managed electronically through an

subject’ s signs of infection at Screening , Baseline (Day 1), Week 12 and Week 24 ( TOC ). The 
signs of infection will also be rated at Week 4 , Week 8 and Week 36 (EOFU) if symptoms are 
present  and any time there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a potential recurrence. A vulvovaginal examination 
should be scheduled immediately if there is susp icion of a potential recurrence based on a phone 
contact [CONTACT_765744] (see Section  14.18). The investigator should ensure that 
subjects rate their symptoms of infection at the site every time that the investigator performs a vulvovaginal examination for the rating of signs. 
Inves tigators will assess the signs of infection using the VSS Scale provided in Section 21.0 
[Appendix B ]), a standardized, predefined  scale where each sign of the vagina and/or vulva will 
be given a numerical rating based on severity, as follows: 
• Edema: absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3  
• Erythema : absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3  
• Excoriation or fissures: absent = 0; mild = 1; moderat e = 2; severe = [ADDRESS_1050023]’s period ends but in no case more than [ADDRESS_1050024]  Using the VSS Scale  
Subjects will be asked to rate their vulvovaginal symptoms at Screening, from Day -14 through Day - 1 of the Acute Phase,  and then from Day 1  (Baseline)  through Week 36 (EOFU ) of the 
Prevention of Recurrence Phase. Subjects  will also assess their symptoms at unscheduled visits, 
if applicable .  
Subjects will rate their symptoms of infection using the VSS Scale ( see Appendix B ), where each 
vulvovaginal symptom will be given a numerical rating based on severity, as follows: 
• Itching: absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3  
• Burning: absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3 
• Irritation: absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3  
From Baseline ( Day 1 ) through the Week 36 ( EOFU ) visit, subjects will rate their symptoms and 
record their scores on the VSS Sc ale included in their subject diaries. Symptoms of infection will 
be rated on a weekly basis and at the time of each scheduled or unscheduled visit to the site .  
14.10  Dispensing and Dosing of Open -Label Fluconazole

Diaries will be dispensed to all subjects on Day - 14. At the Baseline (Day 1) v isit of the study: 
• Subjects who do not meet criteria to enter the Prevention of Recurrence phase of the study 
or to enter the Nested Sub-Study will be discontinued from the study and will have their diaries collected at that visit.  
• Subjects who do not mee t all criteria to enter the Prevention of Recurrence phase of the 
study but meet eligibility for the Nested Sub -Study will have their diaries e collected for 
review and redispensed at the Sub-Study Baseline visit (see Sub-Study details in Section 21.3 [Appendix C]). 
• Subjects who are eligible to enter the Prevention of Recurrence Phase of the study will 
have their diaries collected and dispensed every three 4 -week period, i.e., at Baseline 
(Day  1), Week 12, Week  24 (TOC), Week 36 (EOFU, diary collection only). 
Subject diaries will be reviewed at all on -site visits ( Baseline [Day 1], Week 4, Week  8, 
Week  12, Week  24 [TOC], Week  36 [EOFU]) and unscheduled visits.  
The subject diaries will include the V ulvovaginal Signs and Symptoms (VSS) Scale so that 
subjects can rate their vulvovaginal symptoms (see Section  14.9 for symptom rating procedures 
and Section  21.2 [Appendix B] for the full VSS Scale). Subjects will record the date of study 
medication dosing, vulvovaginal symptoms rated on a weekly basis and at the time of each 
scheduled or unscheduled visit to the site , other medical concerns or complaints and concomitant 
medications used.  
The site will determine if any signs/symptoms or other medical concerns/complaints recorded on 
the diary should be reported as AEs. The information from the subject diary will be reviewed by [CONTACT_765745] (e.g. 
concomitant medications, AEs, etc.). 
14.12   Sample Collection for Safety Laboratory Tests  
Safety laboratory tests  will be performed by a qualified central laboratory. Blood samples for 
safety laboratory tests will be collected at the Days -4 to -2 visit (Acute Phase, lab visit only) to determine su bject eligibility. Lab results will be reviewed at Baseline (Day 1).  Additional 
samples will be collected at  Week  12 and at unscheduled visits, if needed. If indicated, these may 
be done at Week 36 to follow up on a laboratory abnormality.

Treatment compliance with open-label fluconazole dosing during the Acute Phase will be reviewed by [CONTACT_765746] (Day 1) .  Subjects will be instructed to bring 
all fluconazole supplies (including empty bottles/containers ) with them to assess medication 
compliance. Further details are available in Section 12.5. 
14.14  Assessment of Clinical Outcome following Fluconazole Treatment  
At the Baseline (Day 1)  visit of the study, the investigator will assess the subject’s signs and 
symptoms of infection based on the VSS Scale ratings to determine if the subject achieved a significant resolution of all signs and symptoms of infection (total composite score ≤  2 on the 
VSS Scale) and may enter the Prevention of Recurrence Phase or if the subject did not achieve a significant resolution of her signs and symptoms of infection but meets other criteria to enter the open- label , ibrexafungerp, Nested  Sub-Study (see Section 21.3 [Appendix C] for details 
regarding the Sub-Study). Subjects who do not meet criteria for this study or the Sub- Study will 
be discontinued.

PROTOCOL SCY-078-304 Version 1.0 
03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 14.15  Randomization  
At Baseline  (Day 1) , subjects with a culture -confirmed Candida spp. infection from a sample 
collected at Screening  who achieve a significant resolution of their signs and symptoms and 
continue to meet all study eligibility  criteria will continue to the Prevention of Recurrence Phase, 
where they will be  randomized  at a 1:1 ratio to one of the t wo study treatment groups. Subjects 
will be stratified at randomization based on the presence or absence of uncontrolled diabetes 
mellitus , defined as A1C levels ≥ 8.00% at Baseline (Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus: YES or 
NO), and by [CONTACT_101820] ([LOCATION_003] or Ex- [LOCATION_003]) . 
Subject randomization will be performed using an IWRS , which will assign a unique 
randomization number for each randomized subject corresponding to a study treatment. Only one randomization number and study drug treatment will be assigned to each eligible subject. 
14.16  Dispensing and Dosing of Blinded Study Drug  
At Baseline  (Day  1), eligible subjects will be dispensed bottles  containing double-blind study 
medication supplies for 12 weeks (see Section  12.3.2). At Week 12, subjects will return all their 
bottles of study drug (see Section  14.19) and will be dispensed new supplies for an additional 
12-week  period .  
Study drug will be taken as a single- day treatment repeated every 4 weeks (28 days [±3]) for a 
total of 6 single- day treatments  (Baseline [Day 1], Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and 
Week 20). The first dose of double-blind study drug will be administered at the study site (Baseline [Day 1]) and the remaining doses will be self-administered by [CONTACT_339697], preferably with or immediately after a meal. 
Whenever possible, on- site visits and phone contacts will be scheduled to occur on the date of 
dosing to facilitate reminding subjects to take their study drug dose. It is recommended that each 
subject identifies and keeps their optimal routine to facilitate compliance (for example , 
administering the study drug after breakfast and after dinner on dosing days). An electronic dosing reminder system (e.g. text message) may be implemented for consenting subjects to facilitate study drug dosing compliance. Details of study treatment grou ps and dietary 
requirements for treatment administration are provided in Section  12.1.2 and Section 12.2, 
respectively.  
14.17  Assessment of Q uality of Life  
QOL  will be assessed at Day  -14, Baseline (Day 1), Week  12, Week 24 ( TOC ) and Week 36 
(EOFU) . Quality -of-life tools will include the Euro Quol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Short Form 
Health Survey (SF- 36) and Female Sexual Distress -Revised Scale (FSDS) . 
14.18  Assessment of Potential Recurrence  and Use of Rescue Antifungal 
Medication  
The occurrence of a recurrence is the key efficacy parameter in this study. Randomized subjects 
will be assessed for potential recurrence at all visits during the Prevention of Recurrence Phase 
following Day 1 (Baseline) (i.e., from Day 2 through Week 36 [EOFU]), including phone 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1050026] or at any other time there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a potential recurrence (any kind of recurrence, 
i.e., Mycologically Proven, Presumed or Suspected) , subjects will be instructed to visit the study 
center for a proper evaluation of their recurrence before initiating any VVC treatment.  
14.18.1  Categories of Recurrences 
In this study, Recurrences of VVC will be broken into three categories: 
• Mycologically Proven Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥  3 
on the VSS Scale and a culture positive for Candida spp. that required antifungal treatment.  
• Presumed Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥ 3 on the VSS 
Scale that required antifungal treatment and for which there is a positive KO H microscopy 
but no positive fungal culture.  
• Suspected Recurrence: An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765680] (including self- administration with over -the-counter antifungals ) regardless of VSS 
composite score but for which there i s no mycological evidence of disease, such as a 
positive KOH microscopy or fungal culture.  
14.18.[ADDRESS_1050027] has symptoms suggestive of Candida infection (itching, 
burning, irritation) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_765678], the following procedures must be completed: 
• Rate and d ocument symptoms in the eCRF  (Section  14.9), 
• Perform v aginal examination to rate signs  and document in the eCRF ( Section  14.8), 
• Measure vaginal pH  at the site  and document results in the eCRF  (Section  14.7), 
• Collect v aginal sample for KOH testing and investigation of potential bacterial vaginosis 
and Trichomonas vaginal  infection at the  site or b y the local laboratory  (Section  14.7),  
• Collect v aginal samples for fungal culture by [CONTACT_2237] ( Section  14.7), and 
• Document any additional antifungal treatment used by [CONTACT_748] ( Section  14.21).  
All of the procedures above should be completed prior to administration of rescue antifungal medication. Subjects participating in the study should be strongly discouraged from self -
administering any treatment for a potential recurrence.  Ideally, if the severity of the 
symptoms allows based on the investigator’s judgment, the initiation of antifungal therapy should be delayed until results from the vaginal culture are available to confirm that the epi[INVESTIGATOR_765679]. and not to other cause of v aginitis.   
 
The following steps should be followed for potential recurrences: 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,521 
PROTOCOL SCY-078-304 Version 1.0 
03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 • If the vaginal culture results are positive for yeast and the subject remains symptomatic 
(VSS score ≥3) , rescue antifungal therapy should be offered and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_765703] a Mycologically Proven Recurrence. Rescue antifungal therapy should be documented in the eCRF. 
• If the vaginal culture results are negative for yeast, other causes of vaginitis (e.g. bacterial vaginitis or trichomoniasis ) should be further investigated and rescue antifungal therapy 
may not be indicated.  Subjects with a diagnosis of vaginitis caused by [CONTACT_765747] (e.g. bacterial vaginitis or trichomoniasis) may receive treatment for these conditions as indicated and the vaginitis epi[INVESTIGATOR_765704]. 
• If the vaginal culture results are negative for yeast but the patient was given rescue antifungal therapy based on KOH results and symptoms (VSS score ≥3) , the epi[INVESTIGATOR_765705] a Presumed  Recurrence. The  rescue antifungal therapy administered 
should be documented in the eCRF. 
• Empi[INVESTIGATOR_765706]. infection is strongly 
discouraged. Subjects who receive empi[INVESTIGATOR_765707] a potential 
recurrence of VVC prior to documenting the Candida spp. infection should still have their vaginal evaluation including KOH and culture collected as soon as possible. T hese 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_765708].  
• If subjects experience a relapse of the VVC symptoms, they should be strongly discouraged from self- administering any treatment for VVC and instructed to visit the 
study site for evaluation of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_765709], if needed.   
• In the event that the subject self -administers, or another physician prescribes therapy for a 
recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_765710], the subject should still be seen at the study site as soon as possible for an unscheduled visit, which should include collection of a vaginal swab for culture.  
14.18.3  Rescue Antifungal Therapy  
Subjects will be offered one dose of fluconazole 150 mg as rescue therapy. Other antifungal rescue therapy may be administered, per investigator ’s discretion, based on the Candida species 
reported from the culture results. All antifungal therapy administered during the study should be documented in the EDC, with the reason for use clearly indicated (i.e., Mycologically Proven Recurrence, Presumed Recurrence or Suspected Recurrence).  
If a subject experiences one or more recurrences during the Study Treatment Period (i.e., a Mycologically Proven Recurrence, a Presumed Recurrence or a Suspected Recurrence ), she will 
continue her  scheduled study drug administration and will complete all scheduled visits until 
reaching EOFU.

14.21  Prior and Concomitant Medication Review  
All medications (including prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements, and herbal products) taken from 28 days before Screening through the Week 24 (TOC) visit will be recorded on the eCRF. Only the use of other antifungal medications, medications used to treat vaginal bacterial or parasitic infections, topi[INVESTIGATOR_765712] a study-drug related AE will be recorded after the TOC visit through the last study visit (Week 36 [EOFU]).  Start and stop dates of concomitant medications will be recorded on the eCRF. Prior and concomitant medications will be reviewed and recorded at all scheduled and unscheduled study visits. 
See Section  13.0 for prohibited medications, medications to be administered with caution and 
further details for non-study treatments. 
14.22  Adverse Event Monitoring  
AEs will be recorded and reviewed at all schedul ed and unscheduled study visits  from the time 
the ICF is signed (Screening) through W eek 24 (TOC). New AEs starting after W eek 24 and 
until W eek 36 will be recorded only if they led to the use of other antifungal medications or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_27347], i f they are a vaginal bacterial or parasitic infection, or if they  are 
deemed related to the previously administered study drug. See Section 16.0 for further reference.

whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug/study intervention, whether or not related to the study drug/study intervention. 
Any laboratory abnormality that is  deemed to be clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_765713] e CRF , whether or 
not it is  related to the study drug. 
Stable chronic conditions that are present prior to clinical trial enrollment and do not 
worsen are not considered AEs  and will be accounted for in the subject ’s medical history.  
The following can be considered AEs: 
• An exacerbation of a pre- existing illness  
• An increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756] 
• A condition detected or diagnose d after the initiation of treatment with study 
medication, even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study 
• Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at Baseline (Day 1)  that worsen 
after signing the informed consent or following the initiation of treatment with study medication 
The following are not  considered AEs:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction or transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE 
• Pre-existing disease or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that 
do not worsen 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27352]/convenience admissions) 
• The disease being studied, or signs or symptoms associated with the disease, 
unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition or a worsening of the 
disease being studied 
16.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is defined as an AE meeting one of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening event 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765714], Inc.  IND # 107,521 
PROTOCOL SCY-078-304 Version 1.0 
 
03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
Any other important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes may 
be considered a SAE  when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may 
jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
A life -threatening AE is any AE that places the subject , in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.  It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred  in a more severe form, might have caused death.

PROTOCOL SCY-078-304 Version 1.0 
 
03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 16.6 Unexpected  Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB  or is of greater specificity or 
severity than those that have been observed with the particular study drug being tested. 
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the IB listed onl y cerebral vascular accidents. 
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the IB 
as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
16.[ADDRESS_1050032] in accordance with accepted regulatory requirements. The principal investigator ( PI) must make all the subject data available to the monitor for review during 
the planned site monitoring visits. Arrangements for monitoring visits will be made in advance, except in emergency cases.  
16.8 Grading of Adverse Events  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE refers to the extent to which it affects the subject ’s 
daily activities and will be classified by [CONTACT_27414], moderate or severe using the following criteria:  
• Mild :  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated.  Not likely to require 
medical attention.  
• Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause some interference with daily activity .  
May require medical intervention. 
• Severe:  Intense enough to disrupt daily activities .  Likely requires medical 
intervention. 
Clarification of the difference in meaning between “severe” and “serious” 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as 
in mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to lif e or functioning.

03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 16.9 Causality Assessment  
The investigator will assess causality (i.e., whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study drug caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs.  The relationship will be characterized using the following classification: 
• Related :  The temporal relationship of the AE with the study drug makes causality 
possible and as likely or more likely than due to another cause such as other drugs, a surgical intervention or an underlying disease. 
• Not related :  The temporal relationship of the AE with the study drug makes 
causality improbable and can be due to another cause such as other drugs, a surgical intervention or an underlying dise ase. 
16.10  Adverse Event Collection Timeframe  
AEs and SAEs will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed (Screening) through Week  24 (TOC). New AEs starting after Week [ADDRESS_1050033]/Ethics  
Committee ( IRB/EC) in accordance with its regulations and guidelines. 
16.12  Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Follow-up  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed up to resolution (the subject ’s health has returned to 
her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal) or until an outcome is reached, stabilization occurs (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event) or the event is otherwise explained, regardless of whether the subject  is still participating in the study. All appropriate therapeutic measures should be 
undertaken and recorded. Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution of the event (s).

03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 16.13  Serious Adverse Event Reporting – Procedures for Investigators 
Initial Reports and Follow -Up SAE Reports:  To report an SAE, the SAE eCRF form 
within the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system must be completed. All SAEs, whether 
or not deemed drug- related  or expected, must be reported by [CONTACT_765750] [ADDRESS_1050034] becoming aware of the event.  The investigator/qualified designee will enter the required information regarding the SAE into the appropriate form, which will automatically result in distribution of the information to the appropriate sponsor contact. 
If the EDC system is temporarily unavailable (>  2
 4 hours), the event, including the 
investigator-determined causality to study drug, should be reported via a paper back -up 
SAE form to [COMPANY_003]  Safety Surveillance (contact [CONTACT_3031], i.e. , e-mail or fax will be 
available on the SAE form).   
Upon return of the availability of EDC system, the SAE information must be entered into 
the EDC system as soon as possible. The SAE f orm within the EDC system must be 
updated within 24 hours of knowledge/receipt of SAE follow-up information. 
16.14  Procedures for Emergency Unblinding  
This is a double-blind study. The Investigator should only be unblinded if it is necessary to determine treatment of emergency.  The study personnel responsible for the treatment 
assignment can provide the information necessary to unblind the investigator (evaluator) , 
in case of an emergency. If the evaluator is unblinded , the reason for unblinding should 
be documented in the comment page of the e CRF.

All statistical analysis  will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later, unless 
otherwise stated.  All statistical tests will be two -sided and interpreted at a 5% 
significance level.  
Descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, etc.) 
will be provided for all continuous variables; frequencies and percentages will be tabulated for incidence and categorical variables.  For parameters measured over time, observed values and changes from baseline will be described for each time point. 
The Mycologically Proven Recurrence and  Mycological E radication rates will be 
described by [CONTACT_27421], when the number of isolates per species allows.  
The percentage of subjects with Mycologically Proven Recurrence will be described by 
[CONTACT_765752][INVESTIGATOR_169572] 12 months prior to randomization.  
All analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570], as appropriate.  Unless otherwise 
stated, d ata will be analyzed as is with no imputation.  No adjustment for multiplicity will 
be employed. 
A Statistical Analysis P lan (SAP)  describing all final statistical analyses in detail will be 
provided as a separate document. The SAP  will be finalized prior to the unblinding of the 
study treatments  for analysis . 
18.1 Sample Size Determination  
The primary endpoint of the study is the percent age of subjects with documented Clinical 
Success  up to TOC ( Week 24). Assuming response rates of 65% and 43 % for 
ibrexafungerp and placebo , respectively ; 90% power; and an alpha level of 0.05, 
approximately 240 subjects randomized at a 1:1  ratio are needed  to declare a difference 
between ibrexafungerp and placebo at Week 24 based on Fisher ’s Exact test .  
In order to be randomized, a subject should have achieved the proposed significant 
resolution of signs and symptoms (total composite score ≤ 2 on the VSS Scale) after 
receiving f luconazole therapy for an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_765715] a positive culture for 
Candida spp. from the sample collected at Screening.   It is estimated that approximately 
[ADDRESS_1050037] been randomized. 
18.2 Analysis Populations  
The study populations to be used in the analyses are defined as follows: 
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population: All randomized subjects. 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,521 
PROTOCOL SCY-078-304 Version 1.0 
 
03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 • Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population: All randomized subjects who 
have a confirmed mycological culture for yeast at Screening and a negative culture 
for yeast at Baseline (Day 1).  
• Per-Protocol (PP) Population:  All ITT subjects who did not have major protocol 
deviations likely to affect study efficacy and who have available data at the TOC visit.  Note that subjects who discontinue due to a study-drug- related AE  will be 
classified as  failures for the analyses of efficacy  under the PP population. 
• Safety Population:  All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
study drug (ibrexafungerp or placebo) and who have at least one post- Baseline 
(Day 1) evaluation. 
18.[ADDRESS_1050038] demographics and baseline characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, sex, weight, 
height, body mass index, region (if applicable)  and other relevant parameters will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  
Baseline is defined as  the last non- missing assessment prior to the date (and time if 
appropriate) of the first dose of study drug. Change from baseline is defined as:  post-
baseline value – baseline value.  
18.[ADDRESS_1050039] a TOC (We ek 24) assessment  will be 
assigned as treatment failures. For subjects who withdraw from the study early, every 
effort will be made to collect TOC  or EOFU visit information (as applicable) at the point 
of withdrawal.  Missing data will be further described in the SAP  for early withdraw al 
subjects.

03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 70 18.6 Efficacy 
18.6.1  Efficacy Assessments 
Efficacy assessments will be based on clinical evaluations, mycological testing and QOL.  
The primary efficacy endpoint  of the study is the percentage of subjects with 
documented Clinical Success (defined as subjects having a TOC evaluation and no 
Mycologically  Proven, Presumed or Suspected Recurrence of VVC ) up to TOC (Week 
24).  The key secondary efficacy endpoint  is the percentage of subjects with no 
Mycologically Proven Recurrence (defined as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥ 3 on the VSS Scale and a culture positive for Candida spp. that required antifungal treatment) at TOC (Week 24).  
Other secondary efficacy endpoints  will also be assessed (see Section  9.3). 
The following efficacy outcomes will be evaluated in the study: 
• Clinical Success: Subjects having a TOC evaluation and no Mycologically
 Proven, 
Presumed or Suspected Recurrence of VVC  
• Recurrence of VVC : In this study, Recurrences of VVC will be broken into three 
categories:  
o Mycologically Proven Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite 
score ≥ 3 on the VSS Scale and a culture positive for Candida spp. that required 
antifungal treatment.  
o Presumed Recurrence:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765676] a total composite score ≥ 3 on 
the VSS Scale that required antifungal treatment and for which there is a positive KOH microscopy but no positive fungal culture.  
o Suspected Recurrence: An epi[INVESTIGATOR_765692] (including self- administration with over -the-counter antifungals ) 
regardless of VSS composite score but for which there is no mycological evidence of disease, such as a positive KOH microscopy or fungal culture.  
• Mycological Eradication: Negative fungal culture (no growth of Candida species).  
 
18.6.2  Efficacy Analyses 
The efficacy analyses will be conducted using the ITT (primary analysis population), mITT, and PP populations. The efficacy parameters will be evaluated comparing the 
ibrexafungerp treatment group versus the placebo  group. 
The primary endpoint, the percentage of subjects with   documented Clinical Success  up 
to TOC (Week 24) , will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test 
adjusted for site ; p-values and 95% confidence intervals will be presented. Subjects 
whose results are missing at TOC (Week 24) will be imputed as failures in the analysis. In the event that model convergence is an issue with a stratifi ed analysis, alternative 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1050041] analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
model will be used including effects for treatment and site; p-values and 95% confidence 
intervals will be presented. For other categorical endpoints, the CMH test adjusted for 
site will be p erformed, and p-values and 95% confidence intervals will be presented. 
For the ordered categorical endpoint, a proportional odds model will be fitted accounting for the effects of treatment and site.  The proportional odds model will fit an ordered regression model for the ordinal dependent variable as described by [CONTACT_765733] (1980).  If the assumption of proportional odds is violated alternative analyses will be considered which require a weaker assumption. 
18.7 Safety  
18.7.1  Safety Assessments 
Safety will be e valuated throughout the study, including the following parameters: AEs, 
treatment discontinuations, vital signs, safety laboratory tests and prior and concomitant medications . 
Safety procedures are described in Section  14.0 and safety assessments are described in 
Section  16.0. 
18.7.2  Analyses 
No form al statistical analysis is planned for the safety data. Safety analyses will be 
conducted using the safety population. AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 19.1 or higher. The i ncidence and severity 
of treatment -emergent AEs and SAEs and their relationship to treatment will be 
summarized  by [CONTACT_6657]. The percentage of subjects who  
discontinued study treatment and the reasons for discontinuation will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
 Laboratory evaluations and vital signs will be summarized as observed values and as 
changes from Baseline by [CONTACT_1570]. In addition, shifts (wit h respect to the 
reference range) from Baseline will be presented for laboratory tests by [CONTACT_1570].

CYP3A4 substrates 
CYP  Substrates 
3A4 In vitro , ibrexafungerp  was an inhibitor of CYP3A mediated metabolism of 
midazolam,  but was only a weak inhibitor of metabolism of testosterone. The clinical 
significance of this inhibitio n is unknown; caution should be exercised when 
administering ibrexafungerp with drugs known to be CYP3A sensitive substrates with 
narrow therapeutic index, such as midazolam. 
Subjects receiving sirolimus, tacrolimus , warfarin , cyclosporine or amiodarone are 
permitted for enrollment in the study and these medications may be administered 
concomitantly with ibrexafungerp with close monitoring. Dosing adjustments and subsequent monitoring of sirolimus and warfarin should be undertaken in accordance 
with product prescribing information for the respective agents. 
OATP1B3 substrates 
OATP  Substrate 
1B3 In vitro , ibrexafungerp  is an inhibitor of the OATP1B3 liver uptake transporter.  The 
clinical significance of this inhibition is unknown; however, there is a potential risk 
for increased exposure of the concomitant medications (arising from lowered hepatic 
clearance) when admin istering ibrexafungerp with drugs known to be OATP1B3 
selective substrates.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering 
ibrexafungerp with drugs known to be OATP1B3 selective substrates such as telmisartan, including monitoring the subject for signs of overexposure associated 
with the concomitant medications as described in the product prescribing information.

STUDY DESIGN:   
This study is an exploratory, open-label, single- group nested sub- study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of oral ibrexafungerp (SCY-078) in the treatment of subjects with acute VVC who did not respond to oral fluconazole treatment. Subjects with a history of recurrent VVC 
(enrolled in the Main Study [study SCY 078 304] with an acute VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]), who had a 
culture- confirmed VVC at Screening (Main Study) and failed oral fluconazole will be eligible 
for this sub- study (SCY -078-304S). A subject will be considered to have failed oral 
fluconazole therapy if she did not achieve a significant resolution of the signs and symptoms of infection (defined as a total composite score ≤ 2 on the VSS Scale) at the Baseline Visit (Day 
1) following treatment with oral fluconazole 150 mg once daily (QD) on Days -14, -[ADDRESS_1050048] continue to meet all other applicable eligibility criteria of the M ain 
Study (study SCY -078-304) to enter this study. Subjects who are eligible for this study will be 
offered open-label, one-day oral ibrexafungerp treatment for their unresolved VVC epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
Approximately 60 subjects are planned to enter the study. All eli gible subjects will receive oral 
ibrexafungerp administered as a single-day treatment consisting of two 300- mg doses (total 
dose = 600 mg) given 12 hours apart (±4 hours).  
The study will consist of the following visits:  
• Baseline visit (Day 1):  Subjects wh o meet all criteria for this study will receive the first 
dose of study drug, oral ibrexafungerp 300 mg, at the site and will self- administer the 
second 300-mg dose at home, 12 hours (±4 hours) after the first dose. At this visit, subjects 
will be provided  with subject diaries to record the date and time of their second study drug 
dose and to rate their vulvovaginal symptoms of infection, AEs and concomitant 
medication use from the Baseline (Day 1) visit until the TOC visit (Day 11 ± 3). 
• TOC visit (Day 11 [ ±3]):  At this visit, treatment compliance will be evaluated, and subject 
diaries will be returned and reviewed. The investigators and the subjects will rate the signs and symptoms of infection, respectively, on the VSS Scale (a standardized, predefined 
scale [see STUDY EVALUATIONS below]).  
If the baseline vulvovaginal signs and symptoms have not improved or have worsened, 
vulvovaginal samples for fungal culture, species identification and antifungal susceptibility 
testing will be obtained and sent to a des ignated central laboratory. Additional vaginal

measurements and safety laboratory tests will also be performed.  
• FU visit (Day 25 [±4]): At the FU visit, subjects will rate their symptoms of infection on 
the VSS Scale. Vulvovaginal samples for pH determination, KOH testing and fungal culture should be obtained if there is persistence or worsening of vulvovaginal symptoms. 
Only if symptoms are present, the investigator will perform a vulvovaginal examination to 
rate the subject’s signs of infection.  
The study will include efficacy, safety and tolerability assessments. Efficacy assessments will be based on clinical evaluations (rating of signs and symptoms of infection) and mycological testing (direct microscopic examinations and fungal cultures). Safety and tolerability will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_2695], vital signs, safety laboratory tests and study tre atment discontinuations. See 
STUDY EVALUATIONS for further details.

03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 81 Clinical Evaluation: The signs (edema, erythema and excoriation or fissures) and symptoms 
(itching, burning and irritation) of infection will be assessed by [CONTACT_27379], 
respectively, on the VSS Scale. The VSS Scale is a standardized, predefined scale where each 
sign and symptom will be given a numerical rating based on severity (absent = 0; mild = 1; 
moderate = 2; severe = 3) to calculate a total composite score.  
Mycological Evaluations:  Mycological tests will include direct wet mount microscopic 
examination (performed locally) to visualize clue cells indicative of bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas, direct microscopic examination with 10% KOH (performed locally) to identify 
yeast , and fungal cultures (performed at the central lab) for species identificat ion and 
susceptibility testing.  
Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Safety Evaluations: Safety will be evaluated throughout the study, including the following 
parameters: AEs, vital signs, safety laboratory tests and study treatment discontinuations. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
Sample Size Determination  
The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with Clinical Success (at least 50% reduction from Baseline in the total composite VSS score with no additional antifungal 
therapy required based on investigator ’s judgment ) at the TOC visit. As this is a single arm 
sub-study, a statement regarding the Clinical Success rate and 95% confidence interval will be 
produced.  It is estimated that 60 subjects will be included based upon published fluconazole 
failure rates.  With a study of this size, if the Clinical Success rate for ibrexafungerp were 50%, 
this would correspond to a 95% confidence interval spanning from 36.8% to 63.2%.  Given it 
is expected that the Clinical Success for ibrexafungerp in subjects who have already failed 
fluconazole will be low as these subjects had already failed to respond, a sub- study of this size 
is appropriate to assess the efficacy of ibrexafungerp in this patient population  
Analysis Populations 
The study popula tions to be used in the analyses are defined as follows:  
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : All ibrexafungerp- treated subjects.  
• Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population:  All treated subjects who have a positive 
culture for Candida species at Baseline.  
• Safety Population:  All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug 
and who have at least one post- Baseline evaluation.  
Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy assessments will be based on clinical evaluations, mycological testing and additional 
antifungal use.  
The primary efficacy endpoint, the percentage of subjects with Clinical Success (at least 50% 
reduction from Baseline in the total composite VSS score with no additional antifungal therapy 
required  based on investigator ’s judgment ) at TOC will be assessed on the mITT population 
and will present the Clinical Success rate and the 95% confidence interval calculated using the method of Clopper and Pearson.  Missing data for the primary endpoint will be imputed as 
failure. In addition, the Clinical Success  rate and 95% CI will be calculated where subjects 
with missing values will be removed from the analysis. All other efficacy data will be 
summarized, but not subject to formal statistical analysis.  
The following treatment outcome definitions will be used for the assessment of efficacy relative to Baseline:

19.1 or higher. The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs and their relationship to treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_6657]. The 
percentage of subjects who discontinued study treatment and the reasons for discontinuation will be summarized.  
Safety laboratory evaluations and vital signs will be summarized as observed values and as 
changes from Baseline. In addition, shifts (with respect to the re ference range) from Baseline 
will be presented for laboratory tests.

03JUN2019 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 84 21.3.3  Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
Background information for VVC, recurrent VVC ( RVVC ) and ibrexafungerp is 
available in Section  7.1 of the Main Study (study SCY-078-304). 
Considering the properties of ibrexafungerp as a potent antifungal compound with 
fungicidal activity against Candida spp., enhanced activity in low pH, concentration in vaginal tissue and spectrum of activity encompassing fluconazole- resistant strains, if 
ibrexafungerp is proven effective, it will represent an important alternative treatment for subjects suffering from VVC. 
In order to evaluate the efficacy of ibrexafungerp in the treatment of VVC that is not 
responding to oral fluconazole treatment , subjects who fail to respond to fluconazole 
treatment given as 150 mg once a day on Days -14, -11 and -8, for a total of 3 doses in the Acute Phase of the Main Study (study SCY -078-304) will be entered into this study.  
A subject will be considered not to respond to oral fluconazole treatment if she had a culture-confirmed vulvovaginal Candida spp. infection at Screening (Main Study) but did not achieve a significant resolution of her signs and symptoms at Baseline (Day 1). In addition, subjects must continue to meet all other eligibility criteria for the Main Study to enter this study (see Section  21.3.7).  
Subjects will receive oral ibrexafungerp 300 mg twice a day (BID) for one day (i.e., ibrexafungerp administered as a single -day treatment consisting of two doses of 300 mg 
each [given 12 hours apart ]) on Day 1 only (total dose = 600 mg).  
The ibrexafungerp selected dose of 300 mg BID for 1day showed meaningful clinical and  
mycological response rates in a Phase 2b study (DOVE) with adequate tolerability. This dose is in the range of doses that have been well tolerated in Phase 1 investigations and is the dose in ongoing Phase 3 studies in the treatment of acute VVC.  
The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with Clinical Success (defined as at least 50% reduction from Baseline in the total composite Vulvovaginal Signs and Symptoms [VSS]
 score, with no additional antifungal therapy required  based 
on investigator’s judgment ) at the Test -of-Cure (TOC) visit. Secondary endpoints will 
include the percentage of subjects with Clinical Improvement (partial or complete 
resolution of signs and symptoms [ total composite  score ≤1  on the VSS Sca le] with no 
additional antifungal therapy required  based on investigator’s judgment ), Clinical Cure 
(complete resolution of signs and symptoms [total composite score of 0 on the VSS 
Scale] with no additional antifungal therapy required based on investigator’s judgment ), 
Mycological Eradication, and both Clinical Cure and Mycological Eradication at the TOC visit. The percentage of subjects with Continued Clinical Success (sustained resolution of signs and symptoms in subjects who achieved Clinical Success at  the TOC 
visit) at the Follow -up (FU) visit, and the absolute change in total composite VSS score 
from Baseline to the TOC and FU visits will also be assessed as secondary endpoints. These endpoints are considered appropriate for this study population and design.

Subjects included in the study will maintain the same unique subject identification (ID) number provided at the Screening visit of the Main Study, except that an additional letter coding will be added to the ID number to identify subjects participating in this study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
All study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed at Baseline (Day  1) to ensure 
that the subject qualifies for the trial.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Abbreviated Physical Exam 
An abbreviated physical examination, including general appearance and an overall examination of body systems, will be conducted at the Baseline (Day 1) visit, the TOC (Day 11) visit and any unscheduled visit, if needed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urine Preg nancy Test  
A urine pregnancy test based on the measurement of human chorionic gonadotropin with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL will be performed at the Baseline (Day 1) visit and at unscheduled visits, if needed, by [CONTACT_765742]. The subject must have a negative pregnancy test before taking the first dose of study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vulvovaginal Samples 
The following vulvovaginal samples will be collected during the study: 
• Sample for direct microscopic examination  with 10% KOH:  A vulvovaginal 
sample for KOH testing by [CONTACT_765761], Inc.  IND # 107,521 
PROTOCOL SCY-078-304S Version 1.0

symptoms have not improved or have worsened at the TOC (Day 11) and FU (Day 25) visits, a vaginal sample should be obtained for KOH testing by [CONTACT_12082]. Vaginal samples for KOH should also be collected any other time that a subject experiences persistence or worsening of symptoms (i.e., at unscheduled 
visits, if needed). The sample will be assessed by a local laboratory or at the site by 
[CONTACT_1720] a qualified designee.  
The direct microscopic examination with KOH is intended for the visualization of 
yeasts. If the KOH test is negative, the investigato r should consider other causes 
for the persistence or worsening of the symptoms. 
• Sample for fungal culture: A fungal culture will be collected at the Baseline 
(Day  1) visit for all subjects. If the Baseline (Day 1) vulvovaginal signs and 
symptoms have not improved or have worsened at the TOC (Day 11) and FU (Day 
25) visits, a vaginal sample should be obtained for fungal culture. Vaginal samples for culture should also be collected any other time that a subject experiences persistence or worsening of symptoms (i.e., at unscheduled visits, if needed). The sample will be processed by a central laboratory for species identification. Positive cultures will also be tested for susceptibility against ibrexafungerp, fluconazole and additional antifungal agents, as de emed appropriate based on validated 
methods.. 
• Sample for vaginal pH:  To be collected at the Baseline (Day  1) visit for all 
subjects and at the TOC (Day 11) and FU (Day 25) visits if vulvovaginal signs and symptoms have not improved or have worsened. Samples for pH should also be obtained any time that a subject experiences persistence or worsening of symptoms (i.e., unscheduled visits if needed). The sample will be assessed at the site by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified designee. 
• Sample for identification o f other pathogens: 
o Samples (e.g. wet mount) to rule out bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis  will be collected at Baseline (Day 1) and any time that a subject 
experiences persistence or worsening of symptoms. Samples will be assessed by a local laboratory or at the site by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified designee. 
o Samples to rule out Neisseria  Gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis or  Herpes 
virus are to be collected at the Baseline (Day 1) visit, and then at the TOC (Day 11) and FU (Day 25) visits if vulvovaginal signs and symptoms have not improved or have worsened. Samples should also be collected any time that there is persistence or worsening of symptoms if any of these pathogens is suspected. Samples will be processed by a central laboratory.  
Procedures for collecting and processing local samples, as well as for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_765722], will be described in the laboratory manual.

At the Baseline (Day 1) visit, subjects will receive their first dose of study drug 
(ibrexafungerp 300 mg) at the site and will be given study drug to self- administer their 
second dose (ibrexafungerp 300 mg) at home, approximately 12 hours later on the same day. The two doses should be administered approximately 12 (±4) hours apart. Study drug should be administered preferably with or immediately after a meal. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dispensing, Completion, Collection and Review of Subject 
Diaries 
Subject diaries will be provided to all subjects at the Baseline (Day 1) visit for them to 
complete on a daily basis until the TOC (Day 11) visit. The subject diaries will include the VSS Scale so that subjects can rate their vulvovaginal symptoms  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for sign and symptom rating procedures, 
respectively,  and Section  21.2 [Appendix B] for the full VSS Scale). Subjects will also 
record other medical concerns or complaints, concomitant medications used, adverse events and second dose of study drug details. Subjects will be instructed to return their subject diaries at the TOC (Day 11) visit, when they will be collected and reviewed.  
The site will determine if any signs/symptoms or other medical concerns/complaints recorded on the diary should be reported as AEs. The information from the subject diary will be reviewed by [CONTACT_765764] (e.g. concomitant medications, AEs, etc.). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Collection and Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance will be reviewed by [CONTACT_742722] (Day 11) visit. Subjects (or subjects’ legal representatives, if applicable) will be instructed to bring all bottles (including em pty bottles) of study medication with them to the visit to 
assess treatment compliance. Further details are available in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Sample Size Determination 
The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with Clinical Success (at least 50% reduction from Baseline i n the total composite  VSS score with  no additional 
antifungal therapy required based on investigator’s judgment ) at the TOC visit. As this is 
a single arm sub -study, a statement regarding the  Clinical Success  rate and 95% 
confidence interval will be produced.  It is estimated that 60 subjects will be included based upon published fluconazole failure rates.  With a study of this size, if the Clinical Success rate for ibrexafungerp were 50%, this would correspond to a 95% confidence interval spanning from 36.8% to 63.2%.  Given it is expected tha t the Clinical Success for 
ibrexafungerp in subjects who have already failed fluconazole will be low as these subjects had already failed to respond, a sub-study of this size is appropriate to assess the efficacy of ibrexafungerp in this patient population. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Populations  
The study populations to be used in the analyses are defined as follows: 
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : All ibrexafungerp- treated subjects.  
• Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population: All treated subjects who have a 
positive cultu re for Candida species at Baseline.  
• Safety Population:  All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
study drug and who have at least one post- Baseline evaluation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling of Missing Data and Early Withdrawals 
For the efficacy analyses, subjects who do not have a TOC (Day 11) assessment will be assigned as treatment failures. For subjects who withdraw from the study early, every effort will be made to collect TOC (Day 11) visit information at the point of withdrawal.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary terminology. The number and percentage of subjects taking each medication before and after the first dose of study drug will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Efficacy Assessments 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with Clinical Success (at least 50% reduction from Baseline i n the total composite  VSS score with no 
additional antifungal therapy required based on investigator’s judgment ) at the Test -of-
Cure (TOC) visit.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the percentage of subjects with Clinical 
Improvement at the TOC visit, the percentage of subjects with Clinical Cure at the TOC visit, the percentage of subjects with Mycological Eradication at the TOC visit, the percentage of subjects with both Clinical Cure and Mycological Eradication at the TOC visit, the percentage of subjects with Continued Clinical Success at the FU visit, and the absolute change in total composite VSS score from Baseline to the TOC and FU visits.  
The following treatment outcome definitions will be used for the assessment of efficacy relative to baseline:  
Clinical Outcomes  
• Clinical Success:  at least 50% reduction from Baseline in the total composite VSS 
score with no additional antifungal therapy required based on investigator’s judgment  
• Clinical Improvement: partial or complete resolution of signs and symptoms (total 
composite score  ≤1 on the VSS Sc ale) with no additional antifungal therapy required 
based on investigator’s judgment 
• Clinical Cure: complete resolution of signs and symptoms (total composite score of 0 
on the VSS Scale) with no additional antifungal therapy required based on 
investigator’s judgment 
• Continued Clinical Success: sustained resolution of signs and symptoms in subjects 
who achieved Clinical Success at the TOC visit  
• Clinical Failure: persiste n ce and/or worsening of signs and symptoms or need for 
additional antifungal therapy 
Mycological Outcomes 
• M ycological Eradication: negative culture for growth of Candida species.  
• Mycological Persistence:  positive culture for growth of Candida species.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Efficacy Analyses

[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Safety Assessments 
Safety will be evaluated throughout the study, including the following parameters: AEs, 
treatment discontinuations, physical examination, vital signs, safety laboratory tests, and prior and concomitant medications. 
AEs will be reco rded and reviewed at all scheduled and unscheduled study visits from the 
time the Informed Consent Form is signed in the Main Study. An abbreviated physical 
examination, including general appearance and an overall examination of body systems, will be conducted at Baseline (Day 1) , at the TOC (Day 11) visit, and at unscheduled 
visits, if needed. Vital signs, including blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_765726] (Day 1) and TOC 
(Day  11) visits, and at unscheduled visits, if needed. Safety laboratory tests (hematology 
and blood chemistry) will be measured at the TOC (Day 11) visit and at unscheduled visits, if needed. All prior and concomitant medications taken before Base line (Day 1) 
through the TOC (Day 11) visit will be recorded. Only the use of other antifungal medications, medications used to treat vaginal bacterial or parasitic infections, topi[INVESTIGATOR_765727], or any other medications to treat a study drug rel ated AE will be 
recorded after the TOC (Day 11) visit through the last study visit (FU [Day 25]). 
Safety procedures are described in Section   21.3.10 a nd safety assessments are described 
in Section  21.3.12. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Safety Analyses 
No formal statistical analysis is planned for the safety data. Safety presentations will be 
conducted using the Safety Population. 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
Version 19.1 or higher. The incidence and severity of treatment- emergent AEs and SAEs 
and their relationship to treatment will be summa rized by [CONTACT_39812]. The percentage of subjects who discontinued study treatment and the reasons for discontinuation will be summarized. 
Safety laboratory evaluations and vital signs will be summarized as observed values and 
as changes from Baseline. In addition, shifts (with respect to the reference range) from Baseline will be presented for laboratory tests.

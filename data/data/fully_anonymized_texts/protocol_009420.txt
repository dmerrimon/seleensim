Number of Subjects  Study VX17 -661-116 is a rollover study.  
Approximately 56  subjects from Study 113 B and 65 subjects from Study 115 are 
potentially eligible for enrollment. Up to approximately 1 21 subjects are potentially 
eligible for enrollment.  
  
Study Population  Male and female subjects with CF aged 6 years and older , who completed 
Study  113 B or Study 115  and are  
 homozygous for F508del (F/F),   
 heterozygous for F508del  and a second allele with a residual CFTR -
function mutation (F/RF) , or 
 heterozygous for F508del and a second allele that has been shown to be 
responsive to TEZ/IVA   
  
Investigational Drug  Active substance:  TEZ and IVA  
 Activity:  CFTR corrector and potentiator (increased Cl− secretion)  
 Strength and route of administration:  TEZ 50 -mg/IVA 75 -mg fixed -dose 
combination (FDC) tablet or TEZ  100-mg/IVA 150 -mg FDC tablet; oral 
administration  
  
 Active substance:  IVA 
 Activity:  CFTR potentiator (increased Cl− secretion)  
 Strength and route of administration:  IVA 75 - or 150 -mg tablet; oral 
administration  
  
Study Design  This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, rollover study in subjects with CF who  
are homozygous or heterozygous for F508del  and who completed the Week 24 
Visit in Study 113B  or the Week 8 Visit in Study 115. The study is designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of long -term TEZ/IVA  treatment in pediatric 
subjects aged [ADDRESS_805658], if TEZ/IVA receives marketing authorization  
and is available for the treatment of CF in populations enrolled in this study , 
subjects with the approved CFTR  genotypes may be discontinued from this rollover 
study at the discretion  of the sponsor. If a subject continues  onto a commercially  
available Vertex CFTR modulator , the Early Treatment Termination (ETT) Visit 
will be completed before dosing with commercia l drug begins, and the Safety 
Follow -up Visit will not be required.  
If a subject is continuing onto TEZ/IVA supplied via a Vertex -sponsored managed 
access program (MAP), the ETT Visit will be completed before dosing with 
TEZ/IVA via the MAP, and the Safety  Follow -up Visit will not be required.  
Alternatively, if local health authorities decline to  grant marketing authorization , or 
if clinical benefit is not demonstrated for the use of TEZ/IVA for the treatment of 
CF in populations enrolled in this study , sub jects with the relevant CFTR  genotypes 

Protocol VX17 -661-116, Version 2.3 US  Page 6 of 63 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   
 may be discontinued after communication to investigators and IRBs/IECs of the 
risks/benefits related to the safety and efficacy observed for the subset of subjects. 
If subjects are discontinued from the study, an ETT Visit should occur within 
[ADDRESS_805659] dose of study drug and a Safety Follow -up Visit should occur 
within 28 (± 7) days after the last dose of study drug.   
  
Assessments  Safety Assessments

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects an estimated 70,000 children and adults worldwide.1 CF is a 
progressive, systemic, life -shortening, genetic disease that is caused by [CONTACT_460394]/or 
function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR  gene. In people with CF, loss of 
chloride transport due to defects  in CFTR result in the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the 
bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal absorption, 
reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. Lung disease is the primary 
cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. The median predicted age of survival of 
individuals born today with CF is approximately 40 years of age.1, 2 
Two complementary approaches to increase CFTR -mediated Cl− secretion in the airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_607881].3 One approach is to treat with a c ompound that will modify the cellular 
processing and trafficking of the CFTR protein to increase the amount of functional CFTR at the 
cell surface. This kind of compound has been termed a CFTR corrector. Another approach is to 
treat with a compound that in creases the channel gating activity of CFTR at the cell surface to 
enhance ion transport. This kind of compound has been termed a potentiator.  
Tezacaftor (TEZ) and ivacaftor (IVA) are CFTR modulators with interdependent mechanisms of 
action in treating CF  patients with CFTR mutations that require a combination therapy approach. 
TEZ and IVA both address the underlying cause of CF, and each has a different and essential 
role as a corrector (TEZ) or potentiator (IVA) of the CFTR protein in CF patients.  
TEZ (V X-661) and IVA (VX -770) were developed by [CONTACT_139369] 
(Vertex). TEZ/ IVA combination therapy (trade names Symdeko™ and Symkevi™) is indicated 
for the treatment of CF in patients as young as [ADDRESS_805676] another indicated CFTR  genotype. IVA monotherapy ( Kalydeco ™) is indicated for the 
treatment of CF in patients as young as 2 years old with specific CFTR  mutations including 
certain gating mutations as well the R117H  mutation. The indicated mutations  and approved 
populations  for Symdeko/Symkevi and Kalydeco  vary by [CONTACT_1606]. Please refer to local 
prescribing information or summary of product characteristics for your region for the current 
approved use of Symdeko/Symkevi and Kalydeco.  
Results from 2 piv otal Phase 3 Studies , VX14 -661-106 (Study  106) and VX14 -661-108 
(Study  108), that evaluated  TEZ in  combination with IVA (TEZ/IVA) demonstrated clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant improvements in lung function and key secondary 
endpoints along with favorable safety and benefit/risk profiles with the TEZ daily (qd)/IVA 
every 12 hours (q12h) regimen in CF subjects homozygous for F508 del (F/F) , or heterozygous 
for F508del  and a second mutation that results in residual CFTR function (F/RF), aged 
≥12 years.  
Additional details about TEZ/IVA can be found in the TEZ /IVA  Investigator's Brochure. 
5.2 Study Rationale  
To date, the long -term safety of TEZ/IVA has not yet been evaluated in subjects with CF aged 
6 to 11 years. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term safety 
and tolerability of TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF in this age group,  who are homozygous or 

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.3 US  Page 18 of 63 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   hetero zygous for F508del . The secondary objective is to evaluate the long -term efficacy of 
treatment with TEZ/IVA.  
This study will enroll subjects who completed Studies VX15 -661-113 Part B (Study 113B ) or 
VX1 6-661-115 (Study  115). In both parent studies, subjec ts were 6 to 11 years of age at 
Screening and  are homozygous or heterozygous for F508del .  
6 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
6.1 Primary Objective  
To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF aged 6 years 
and older, who are homozygous or het erozygous for F508del  
6.2 Secondary Objective  
To evaluate the long -term efficacy of TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF aged 6 years and older, who 
are homozygous or heterozygous for F508del

9 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
9.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, open -label, rollover study. A schematic of the study desi gn is shown in 
Figure  9-1.

9.1.[ADDRESS_805682] scheduled visit of the parent 
study; this will occur at the Week  [ADDRESS_805683] scheduled visit in the parent study.  
Subjects who were enrolled in Study  116, but had Day  1 study drug administration procedures 
delayed (e.g., due to an AE), will repeat the safety, LCI (if applicable),  
assessments that were specified to be performed at the Day  [ADDRESS_805684] a Safety  Follow -up Visit 28  (±7) days after the last  dose of  study drug. Safety 
Follow -up Visit assessments are listed in Table  3-1. 
If a subject chooses to continue onto a commercially available Vertex CFTR modulator 
(i.e., TEZ/IVA [if approved for marketing], Kalydeco, Orkambi ™ [lumacaftor/IVA], or another 
approved TEZ/ IVA-containing regimen), the Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) Visit will be 
completed before dosing with the commercial drug begins, and the Safety Follow -up Visit will 
not be required.  
If a subject is continuing onto TEZ/IVA supplied via a Vertex -spon sored managed access 
program (MAP), the ETT Visit will be completed before dosing with TEZ/IVA via the MAP, 
and the Safety Follow -up Visit will not be required (see Section  9.1.3 ).   

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.[ADDRESS_805685] /caregiver  decides to terminate study treatment. Subjects who 
prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow -up Visit, 
approximately 28  (± 7) days after their last dose of study drug.  
If the ETT Visit occurs [ADDRESS_805686] chooses to continue onto a commercially available  Vertex CFTR modulator (i.e., 
TEZ/IVA  [Symdeko] , Kalydeco, Orkambi ™, or another  approved TEZ/IVA -containing drug ), 
the ETT Visit will be completed before dosing with the commercial drug begins, and the Safety 
Follow -up Visit (Section  9.1.2 ) will not be required.  
If a subject is continuing onto TEZ/IVA supplied via a Vertex -sponsored managed access 
program (MAP), the ETT Visit will be completed before dosing with TEZ/IVA via the MAP, 
and the Safety Follow -up Visit will not be re quired.  
Alternatively, if local health authorities decline to approve, or if clinical benefit is not 
demonstrated for the use of TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF in populations enrolled in 
Study  116, subjects with the relevant CFTR  genotypes may be disconti nued after communication 
to investigators and IRBs/IECs of the risks/benefits related to the safety and efficacy observed 
for the subset of subjects concerned. If subjects are discontinued from the study, an ETT Visit 
should occur within [ADDRESS_805687]  dose of study drug and a Safety Follow -up Visit should 
occur within 28  (± 7) days after the last dose of study drug.  
If the subject /caregiver  withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations should be 
performed, and no additional data should be col lected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any 
data and samples collected before such withdrawal of consent.  
9.1.4  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
Safety and tolerability data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_82571] 
(IDMC) to ensure  the safety of the subjects in the study (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Procedural details of 
the IDMC's structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be 
included in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before t he first subject is 
enrolled .  
9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is an open -label study. Randomization is not required.  
9.3 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens  
9.3.1  Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, rollover  study in subjects with C F aged 6 years and 
older , who are homozygous or heterozygous for F508del , and who completed the Week 24 Visit 
in Study  113B  or the Week  8 Visit in Study  115.  

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.3 US  Page 23 of 63 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Approximately 56 subjects from Study  113B  and 65 subjects from Study  115 will be enrolled in 
the study. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long -term TEZ/IVA 
treatment in subjects who were aged 6 through 11 years at the start of the parent study.  
Study  113B  and Study  115 were designed to evaluate  pharmacokinetics , safety, tolerability, 
pharmacodynamics , and efficacy to support an expanded indication for TEZ/IVA in subjects 
6 through  11 years of age, inclusive, who are homozygous or heterozygous for F508del . The 
long-term safety and efficacy of TEZ/IVA treatment has not yet been evaluated in this age group. 
Therefore, r esults from Study  116 will provide information on the safety and efficacy of 
long-term TEZ/IVA treatment in subjects with CF  aged 6 years and older,  homozygous or 
heterozygous for F508del .   
Interim analyses (IAs) , as described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), may occur at any time 
during the study (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
9.3.2  Study Drug Dose and Duration  
The approved  Symdeko dosing regimen for this age group will be used.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subjects ≥12 Years of Age  
Subjects who are ≥12 years of age at enrollment, or who turn 12 years of age during the study, 
will receive a morning dose of TEZ 1 00 mg/IVA 150 mg (FDC tablet) and an evening dose of 
IVA 150 mg (tablet) .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subjects <12 Years of Age  
Subjects who are <12 years of age and  weigh  <30 kg  at the Day 1 Visit will receive a morning 
dose of TEZ  50 mg/IVA 75  mg (fixed -dose combination [FDC] tablet) and an evening dose of 
IVA 75  mg (tablet). Subjects who are <12 years of age and ≥ 30 kg  at the Day 1 Visit will receive 
a morning dose of TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150  mg (FDC tablet) and an evening dose of IVA 1 50 mg 
(tablet). If a subject who weighs < 30 kg  at enrollment subsequently weighs  ≥[ADDRESS_805688] receives a morning dose of TEZ 100  mg/IVA 150  mg (FD C tablet) and an 
evening dose of IVA 150 mg (tablet).  
9.3.[ADDRESS_805689] parameters for clinical studies in drug 
development. The efficacy assessments are widely accepted and generally recogniz ed as reliable, 
accurate, and relevant to the study of patients with CF.  
Ophthalmologic Examinations:  A juvenile rat toxicity study performed to support dosing of IVA 
in subjects <[ADDRESS_805690] 
development; however, a potential association has not been fully excluded.  
LCI Assessment (Subjects From Study  113B  LCI Substud y and Study  115 Only):  LCI is a 
measure of ventilation inhomogeneity that is based on tidal breathing techniques which have 
been evaluated in patients as young as infants.4, [ADDRESS_805691] shown that LCI correlates with 

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.3 US  Page 24 of 63 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second (FEV 1) in its ability to measure airway di sease in patients 
with impacted spi[INVESTIGATOR_1891], but can also detect lung disease at an earlier stage than 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].6, 7 Furthermore, data from Study  VX10 -770-106 in CF subjects  with an FEV 1 >90% 
showed LCI to be a more sensitive outcome measure than FEV 1. 
Sweat Chloride:  In patients with CF, the underlying CFTR ion transport defect results in elevated 
sweat electrolyte levels.8, [ADDRESS_805692] (quantitative pi[INVESTIGATOR_315411]) is the 
most common diagnostic tool for CF. A sweat chloride concentration of 60 mmol/L is 
considered to be diagnostic of CF, whereas <40  mmol/L is considered normal. Based on the 
mechanisms of action of TEZ and IVA, the sweat chloride test is included in this study as a 
measure of the effect o f TEZ/IVA on CFTR activity.  
Nutritional Status ( Measured by [CONTACT_607892]):  Malnutrition is common in patients with CF 
because of increased energy expenditures due to lung disease and fat malabsorption. Given that 
TEZ/IVA is a systemic therapy, it has the  potential to improve extrapulmonary manifestations of 
CF, including those in the gastrointestinal system. Improved nutritional status, defined as an 
increase in weight and/or BMI, is considered an appropriate endpoint for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_607882] -targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. To evaluate the 
effect of TEZ/IVA on growth, change in weight and BMI will be determined.  
As children gain weight and height as part of normal growth, adjustment for age and sex is 
necessary to assess changes in nutritional status.  
Height and weight will be collected 
at the study visits indicated in the schedule of assessments.  
CFQ -R: The CFQ -R is a validated CF -specific instrument that measures the health -related 
quality of life of patients with CF.3, 10, [ADDRESS_805693]. John’s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) 
has the potential to significantly reduce TEZ and IVA exposure and is restricted in this study. 
Case -by-case exceptions for concomitant use of a moderate CYP3A inducer with  TEZ/IVA may 
be granted by [CONTACT_607893] ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_607883].  
A more detailed, but non -exhaustive, list of study prohibitions and cautions for food and 
medication will be provided in the Study Reference Manual .

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medicinal products affected by [CONTACT_460396]/IVA  (CYP3A, P -glycoprotein , or CYP2C9 substrates)  
Co-administration of TEZ/IVA with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, did not 
affect midazolam exposure. No dose adjustment is required when co -administered with CYP3A 
substrates.  
Based on in  vitro data, IVA and its M1 metabolite have the potent ial to inhibit P -glycoprotein 
(P-gp). Co -administration of TEZ/IVA with digoxin, a sensitive P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) substrate, 
increased digoxin exposure by 1.3 -fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P -gp by [CONTACT_312101]. 
Administration of TEZ/IVA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are 
sensitive substrates of P -gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse 
reactions. When using concomitant digoxin or other substrates of P -gp with a narrow therapeutic 
index, TEZ/IVA  should be used with caution and appropriate monitoring. IVA may inhibit 
CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalized ratio during co -administration of 
TEZ/IVA with warfarin is recommended.  
Information regarding all prior and concomitant m edications, including the subject's CF 
medications, other medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies administered at or after 
completion of treatment in the parent study through the Safety Follow -up Visit, if applicable, 
will be recorded in each sub ject's source documents.  
 Subjects should remain on a stable CF medication (and supplement) regimen through the 
Safety  Follow -up Visit. Stable medication regimen is defined as the current medication 
regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at l east 28  days before Day  1. 
Medication changes required for clinical management are allowed during the course of the 
study  and will be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). Restricted/prohibited 
medication guidelines should still be followed ( see Section 9.4 and Table  9-1). Guidelines for 
stable medication regimens for CF are as follows:  
o Subjects who are taking daily inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics 
should remain on that regimen throughout the study.  
o Subjects who are on inhaled cycling antibiotics s hould continue on their prior schedule. 
The timing of the first dose of study drug should be synchronized as closely as possible to 
the first day of inhaled cycling antibiotics in the cycle.  
o Subjects who alternate [ADDRESS_805697] day of 1  of the inhaled alternating 
antibiotics.  
 There are no restrictions on the concomitant use of corticoste roids.  
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_805698] dose of study drug (the evening dose administered the day before the 
Week  96 Visit), study drug tablets will be administered orally as shown in Table  9-2.  

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.3 US  Page 27 of 63 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   At each study visit the TEZ/IVA dose for each subject will be reassessed based on body weight 
and age and adjusted upward if necessary.  
Study drug should be administered within [ADDRESS_805699] “CF” high -fat, high -calorie meal or snack according to the  following 
guidelines:

enrollment subsequently weighs ≥ [ADDRESS_805700] receives TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h.  
 
1. Study drug should be administered q12h (±  2 hours). For each subject, all doses (morning 
and evening) of study drugs should be administered at approximately the same time each 
day. For example, if the morning dose of study drug is administered at 08:00  on Day 1, all 
subsequent morning doses should be administered between 06:00  and 10:00. On days of 
scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug will be administered at the site after predose 
assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided  by [CONTACT_607894].  
2. If a subject's scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be 
used for administering either the morning or evening dose : 
 If the dose in the clinic will be within [ADDRESS_805701]'s scheduled morning dose, 
the subject should withhold their morning dose of study drug, and the morning dose will 
be administered in the clinic.  

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.3 US  Page 28 of 63 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated    If the dose in the clinic will be more than [ADDRESS_805702]'s scheduled morning 
dose, the subject should take the morning dose at home, and the evening dose will be 
administered in the clinic. In this event, all assessments will be collected relative to the 
evening dose.  
3. For visits after Day  1, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused study drug and 
materials associated with the study drug  to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, 
as appropriate . 
4. At the Week [ADDRESS_805703] should take 
his/her dose with food. If more than [ADDRESS_805704] elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the 
subject should skip that dose and resume his/her normal schedule for the following dose. For 
example : 
 If the morning dose of study drug shou ld have been taken at approximately 08:00, and the 
subject remembers at 12:00 that he/she forgot to take his/her dose, he/she should take the 
dose with food as soon as possible.  
 If the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:[ADDRESS_805705] elapsed beyond the scheduled dosing time (i.e., the time is  past 
14:00), the subject would resume dosing with the evening dose at approximately 20:00.  
9.8 Dose Modification for Use With Concomitant CYP3A Inhibitors  
Dosing reco mmendations for subjects taking concomitant CYP3A inhibitors are described in 
Table  9-3. The dosage of TEZ/IVA can be altered only when co -administered  with moderate or 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A. The dosage of TEZ/IVA cannot be otherwise altered, but the 
investigator can interrupt or stop treatment.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.9 Discontinuation of Study Participation   
If after review of a marketing application, local health authorities decline to approve TEZ/IVA 
for the treatment of CF in a corresponding population aged ≥12 years, pediatric subjects enrolled 
in Study  116 with the relevant CFTR  genotypes may be discontinued after communication to 
investigators and IRBs/IECs of the risks/benefits related to the safety and efficacy observed for 
the subset of subjects. In addition, if evaluation of efficacy data from Phase  3 Study 
VX14 -661-110 sugg ests that the TEZ/IVA treatment does not provide clinically meaningful 
benefit for a population enrolled in Study  116, Vertex may recommend that subjects with 
relevant CFTR  genotypes discontinue  the study.  
Subjects who become eligible to receive commercial ly available TEZ/IVA by [CONTACT_168793] a 
physician may be discontinued from this rollover study at the discretion of the sponsor. The 
timing of assessments after study discontinuation is described in  Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_805706]  or at the caregiver’s 
request . Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of 
the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or 
administrative reason s. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject 
will continue to be followed, provided the subject has not withdrawn consent.  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_607895]/caregiver . In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject 
outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the 
subject /caregiver  return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a 
Safety Follow -up Visit, if applicable (see Section  9.1.3 ), and follow  up with the subject /caregiver  
regarding any unresolved A Es. 
If the subject /caregiver  withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations should be 
performed, and no additional data should be collected. Vertex may retain and continue using the 
study data and samples after the study is over, and may use the s amples and information in the 
development of the study compound, and for other drugs and diagnostics, in publications and 
presentations, and for education purposes. If the subject withdraws from the study, the study data 
and samples collected will remain p art of the study. A subject /caregiver  will not be able to 
request the withdrawal of his/her information from the study data. A subject /caregiver  may 
request destruction of the samples collected from him/her during the study as long as those 
samples can be identified as his/her samples.

11 ASSESSMENTS  
11.1 Timing of Assessments  
All information regarding the timing assessments is shown in the schedule of assessments 
(Table  3-1). The following assessments must be performed in the order specifie d below when 
more than 1  assessment is required at a particular time point:  
1. The CFQ -R must  be completed before the start of any other assessments scheduled at that 
visit.  
2. Height and weight measurements should be performed before dosing.  
3. ECGs will be perfo rmed before dosing and before any other procedures that may affect heart 
rate (e.g., blood draws).  
4. The multiple -breath washout ( MBW ) assessment (performed for subjects from Study 115 
and the Study 113B  LCI Substudy only) will be performed  
5. Both MBW will be performed before dosing and should be 
performed before use of bronchodilators.  
6. Blood sampling for clinical laboratory assessments at all visits, except the Day [ADDRESS_805710] and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history,  height, 
and weight. Select demographic and baseline characteristic data and medical history will be 
derived from the parent study. Age, sex, race, and ethnicity will be derived from the parent 
study ,

11.3.1  Lung Clearance Index (Study 115 and Study 113B  LCI Substudy 
Subjects Only)  
LCI derived from N 2-MBW  testing will be conducted at visits specified in Table  3-[ADDRESS_805711] of TEZ/IVA on lung ventilation inhomogeneity. LCI 2.5 represents the number of lung 
turnovers required to reduce the end tidal inert gas concentration to 1/40th of its s tarting value, 
Pre-bronchodilator MBW testing is defined as MBW testing performed for subjects who have  
 withheld their short -acting bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) or anticholinergic (e.g.,  Atrovent®) 
for more than 4  hours before the MBW testing;  
 withheld their long -acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol) more than 12  hours before the 
MBW testing; and  
 withheld their once -daily, long -acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1893] [Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35444]®]) 
for more than 24  hours before the MBW testing.  
MBW testing should be performed “pre -bronchodilator.” MBW testing must be performed 
before dosing, unless noted otherwise. In the event that a subject forgets to withhold 
bronchodilator(s), MBW testing should be performed accord ing to the following:  
 If a subject's Day  [ADDRESS_805712] -bronchodilator MBW testing will be obtained for 
that visit only, and the visit will not be res cheduled.  
 If on Day  1, the subject forgets to withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator, MBW testing 
should be performed post -bronchodilator and all subsequent MBW testing (according to the 
Schedule of Assessments detailed for LCI in Table  3-1) should be performed 
post-bronchodilator.  
 Each MBW test will be recorded in the source documents as pre -bronchodilator or 
post-bronchodilator.  
MBW 
assessments will be performed in multiple replicates. Detailed LCI procedures will be supplied in 
a separate study manual.  
Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not be informed of their study -related LCI results 
during the Treatment Period.  

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.[ADDRESS_805713] be conducted before dosing with study drug. At each time point, 
2 samples will be collected, 1  sample from each arm (left  and right). No other assessments 
should overlap with c ollection of sweat chloride .  
Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not be informed of their study -related sweat chloride 
results during the Treatment Period.

other scheduled visits, these samples will be collected at any time during the visit, but not before 
the ECG is performed (Section 11.1). Subjects are not required to fast before collection of blood 
samples ; however  the meal or snack should be provide d after blood collection . 
Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a local or central laboratory. For purposes of study 
data collection , only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local 
laboratories may be used at the discretion o f the local investigator only for management of 
urgent medical issues . If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically 
significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_607897]. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the 
central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the investigator may base the 
assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value . 
Laboratory test results th at are abnormal and considered clinically significant will be reported as 
AEs (see Section  13.1). The safety laboratory test panels are shown in Table  11-1.

The CFTR  genotype result can be taken from Study 113 or Study 115. If the genotype result is 
not available, subjects will be tested for CFTR  genotype; if the genotype result from the 
confirmatory test is exclusionary, then the subject will be removed from the stud y. 
Instructions for collecting a sample for CFTR  genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_607884].  
Pregnancy Testing for Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential Who Are Not Abstinent 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ): 
Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the Day  [ADDRESS_805718] is positive on Day  1, study drug will not be administered and the 
pregnancy will be confirmed with a serum beta -human chorionic gonadotropin (β -HCG) test. If 
pregnancy is confirmed , the subject will not be eligible for the study.    
For pregnancy tests conducted after dosing, if a serum β -HCG test is positive, the pregnancy will 
be reported and the subject will be permanently withdrawn from study drug dosing as dis cussed 
in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . If a pregnancy test is positive, the procedures outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  
will be followed.  
Additional Evaluations :  
Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if judged by [CONTACT_607898].  
11.4.[ADDRESS_805719] Parameters  
Liver function testing (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], gamma -
glutamyl transferase [GGT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], direct bilirubin, and total bilirubin) 
must be performed as noted in Table  3-[ADDRESS_805720] elevations of >3  × upper limit of normal 
(ULN) and clinical symptoms must be followed closely, including repeat confirmatory testing 
performed by [CONTACT_66768] [ADDRESS_805721] is 
>5 × ULN, repeat follow -up levels must be obtained within 7  ± [ADDRESS_805722] the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory 
as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours).  
Study Drug Interruption : 
Study drug administ ration must be interrupted  immediately ( before  confirmatory testing), and 
the medical monitor must be notified, if any of the following criteria is met:  
 ALT or AST >8  × ULN  
 ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2  weeks  
 ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2  × ULN and/or clinical jaundice  
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  
If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g.,  acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol 
ingestion) for the elevated transaminases is identified, regardless of whether ALT or AST levels 
have improved, study drug treatment must be permanently discontinued if repeat testing within 
[ADDRESS_805723] their transaminases monitored closely until levels normalize 
or return to baseline.  
Resumption of Study Drug : 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevatio n has been identified, study drug may 
be resumed once transaminases values decrease to  ≤2 × ULN  or to baseline levels  (as defined in 
Section 12.3.1 ). Approval of the medical monitor is required before resumption of study drug. 
Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases should be assessed weekly for 4  weeks. If a 
protocol -defined transaminase elevation occurs within 4  weeks of rechallenge with the study 
drug (with con firmation of the initial elevation by [CONTACT_94525] 48 to 72 hours), then the 
study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology.

Table  3-1). At other visits, symptom -directed PE s and symptom -directed vital sign assessments 
can be pe rformed at the discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider . PEs will also occur 
at any time during the study if trig gered by [CONTACT_2695] . 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and throat  
(EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] ; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and 
neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically 
indicated. After  consenting , any clinically significant abnormal findings in PE s will be reported 
as AEs.  

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.3 US  Page 39 of 63 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. The subject will be instructed to rest for at least [ADDRESS_805725] 12 -lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table  3-1). Additional standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed at 
any other time, if clinically indicated. The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following 
guidelines:  
 The subject will be instructed to rest in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5  minutes before 
having an ECG performed.  
 The ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such as 
blood draws.  
 ECGs will be performed in triplicate on Day 1.  
Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the Sa fety 
Follow -up Visit will be recorded as AEs.   
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
Study 116 Day 1  measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >45  msec from Day 1  or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥5 00 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2  additional ECGs will be performed 
approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>45  msec from Day 1  or 
≥500  msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from [ADDRESS_805726] had an ophthalmological exam ination  in the parent study less than 28  days 
before  the Day  1 Visit of Study  116, the exam ination  does not need to be repe ated on Day  1. 
The examination includes:  
 measurement of best corrected distance visual acuity of each eye  

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.3 US  Page 40 of 63 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated    pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp  
Subjects will have ophthalmologic exam ination s as noted in Table  3-1. An ophthalmologic 
examination will be performed at the Week  [ADDRESS_805727] an examination at 
either the Week  96 Visit (± 28 days) OR the Safety Follow -up Visit, but the exam ination  must be 
completed by [CONTACT_363531] -up Visit. For subjects who discontinue treatment 
after receiving at least 1 dose of study drug, this examination may be completed at the ETT Visit 
or the Safety Follow -up Visit (if applicable [Section 9.1.2 ]), but must be completed by [CONTACT_607899] -up Visit.  
If a cataract or lens opacity  is identified and determined to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_607900]  116, the subject /caregiver  and Vertex medical 
monitor will be notified. The subject /caregiver  may elect to continue or discontinue study drug 
treatment. If the subject discontinues study drug treatment, the subject should complete the ETT 
and the Safety Follow -up Visits (see Sections 9.1.2  and 9.1.3 ). If the subject continues study 
drug treatment, more frequent ophthalmologic monitoring should be considered.

1. The oral hormonal contraceptives should be in successful use from at least [ADDRESS_805731] dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted) and until [ADDRESS_805732] 60  days after 
beginning oral contraceptives.  
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
 True abstinence for the sub ject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
 If the male is infertile (e. g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented through 
examination of a semen specimen or by [CONTACT_607901].

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated    If the female is of non -childbearing potential, per the following:  
o Documented hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy/salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy.  
o Has not achieved menarche (has not had her first menstrual period). If a female achieves 
menarche during the study, she will need to follow acceptable methods of cont raception 
or abstinence.  
 For subjects for whom contraception methods are not waived due to at least 1  of the reasons 
cited above, the following are acceptable contraceptive methods for male subjects and their 
female (non -study) partners, and for female sub jects and their male (non -study) partners:  
Table 11-2 Acceptable Methods of Contraception  
 Male vasectomy  at least  [ADDRESS_805733] -vasectomy semen analysis for 
sperm.  
 Male or female condom with or without spermicide (either as a single product if commercially available and/or 
as allowed according to local regulations; otherwise condom and spermicide as separate products).  
 Female bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6  months previously.  
 Female diaphragm, cervical cap, or vaginal sponge, each with spermicide (where available).  
 Female continuous use of an intrauterine device (non -hormone releasing or hormone releasing) for at least [ADDRESS_805734] dose of study d rug 
 Female combined (estrogen and progestogen -containing) or progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation if successfully used for at least [ADDRESS_805735] 60  days after beginning hormonal 
contraception.  
 
Important notes:  
 Local requirements may prohibit the use of some of these acceptable methods listed above. 
Please contact [CONTACT_64168].  
 If applicable,  additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to 
local regulations and/or requirements.  
 Male and female subjects who are not sexually  active at the time of informed consent 
signature  [CONTACT_607915].  
 Female condom used with male condom (as a double method of contraception) is not an 
acceptable method of contraception due to risk of tearing; a different acceptable method of 
birth control must be used a s described in Table 11-2.  
 Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant 
during the study through [ADDRESS_805736] dose of study drug.  
 Female subjects should not nurse a child from the start of study drug dosing through [ADDRESS_805737] dose of study drug.

group will be included in the MMRM model.  
The model will include the absolute change from baseline as the dependent variable; visit  as a 
fixed effect; and subject as a random effect , with or without adjustment f or age, genotype 
mutation group , and baseline value.  
In the model, v isit will be treated as a class variable, assuming an unstructured covariance matrix 
to model the within -subject variability. This model imposes no assumptions on the correlational 
structure and is considered robust. Denominator degrees of freedom for the F test for fixed 
effects will be estimated using the Kenward -Roger approximation. If there is a convergence 
problem due to the use of an unstructured covariance matrix, a compound symmetry covariance 
structure will be used to model the within -subject error s. With a mixed -effects model based on a 
restricted maximum likelihood estimation used for the primary analysis and assuming that, 
conditional on fixed and random effects, data are missing at random, no imputation of missing 
data will be performed.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   The LS mean and the associated 95% CI at each defined analysis visit will be provided for the 
corresponding efficacy endpoints.  
12.3.4  Safety Analysis  
The overall safety profile of study drug will be assessed in terms of the following safety and 
tolerability endpoints:  
 AEs 
 Clinical laboratory values (hematology and serum chemistry)  
 Standard 12-lead ECGs  
 Vital signs  
 Pulse oximetry  
 PE 
 Ophthalmologic examination  
Safety endpoints will be analyzed based on the Safety Set using data during the Safety analysis 
period ( TE period). Only descriptive summaries will be presented and no statistical test ing is 
planned.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
AEs will be classified as pretreatment AEs or treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs), defined as 
follows:  
Pretreatment AE:  any AE that started before the first dose of study drug  
TEAE:  any AE that worsened (either in severity or se riousness) or that was newly developed at 
or after the first dose date of study drug through the end of the TE period .  
For AEs with completely missing or partially missing start dates, if there is no clear evidence 
that the AEs started before or after stu dy treatment, the AEs will be classified as TEAEs.  
Details for imputing missing or partial start dates of AE s are described in the SAP.  
AE summary tables will be presented for TEAEs only, overall and by [CONTACT_1570], and will 
include the following:  
 All TEAEs  
 TEAEs by [CONTACT_155429]

13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADM INISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as  any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g.,  increase in its severity o r 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinically Significant Assessme nts 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin).  
An abnorma l study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following:  
 Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  
 Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.3 US  Page 50 of 63 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated    A change in the dose o f study drug or discontinuation from the study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assess ment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_805747]’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Docum entation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points:  
 For subjects who do not enroll: until time of withdrawal of consent  
 For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow -up Visit: through the Safet y Follow -up Visit  
 For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow -up Visit, the earliest  of 
o [ADDRESS_805748] dose of study drug (see 
Section  9.1.3 ) 
 For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow -up Visit because they will transition 
to commercially available  CFTR modulator , or if the subject will receive TEZ/IVA through a 
Vertex -sponsored MAP: through the ETT Visit (Section  9.1.3 ) 
All subjects /caregivers  will be queried, using nonleadin g questions, about the occurrence of AEs 
at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
[ADDRESS_805749]'s source documents. The following data will be documented for 
each AE:  
 Description of the event  
 Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
 Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
 Severity  
 Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
 Action taken  
 Outcome  
 Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Severity  
 The investigator will determine and record the severity o f all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
September  2017) . AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life threatening.” In 

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.[ADDRESS_805750], the investigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the 
CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according 
to the definit ions in Table  13-1. 
Table  13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening 
(Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table  13-2. 
Table  13-[ADDRESS_805751] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as cha racteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories shown in Table  13-3.  

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.[ADDRESS_805752] to an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table  13-4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow -up) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include tr eatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
 Fatal ( death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of 
the study drug)  
 Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immedi ate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  

Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version  2.3 US  Page 53 of 63 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated    Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person's ability to conduct normal life  functions)  
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic br onchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g.,  surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject /caregiver  signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_607886] /caregiver  signed the ICF, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_607887], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_607888] d sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_607889] (e.g.,  social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will 
not be considered to indicate an SAE.  
Clarification will be made betw een the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of rela tively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning.  Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_306031]. In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are considered related 
to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours . 
SAEs will be r ecorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter 
referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately 
reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_460428](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be 
assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and 
severity assessment will not be required. For  the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not 
resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes 
of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and 
report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24  hours of identifying an SAE, 
regardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study  drug. The SAE Form will be 
completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on previously 
reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow -up information as soon as it becomes 
available to ensure timely reporting to hea lth authorities.

Vertex Pharmac euticals Incorporated   Summary of Changes to Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Study Protocols  
Vertex is currently evaluating several CFTR modulators in clinical studies for the treatment of 
cystic fibrosis (CF), a serious and life -threatening disease. In completed studies, treatment with 
these CFTR modulators has generally resulted in rapid, robust, clinically meaningful, and 
statistically significant improvements in clinical measures, and are generally safe and well 
tolerated. A dverse events (AEs) seen with these treatments are mostly consistent with common 
manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects.  
During this COVID -19 pand emic, the safety of the subjects, investigators, and site personnel 
participating in these clinical studies is Vertex’s first priority, thus it is important to minimize 
any unnecessary risk to COVID -[ADDRESS_805766] 
to the integrity of the studies. Overall, the benefit -risk of these studies remains favorable.  
Vertex recommends that subjects and sites refer to local guidance regarding travel restrictions. 
There are no operational changes to the  study protocols for subjects who can travel to the study 
sites for their visits. However, to ensure continued safety of subjects who cannot  travel to the 
study sites for their visits (for any reason due to COVID -19), specific alternative measures are 
being implemented to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID -19 (see table below). As the 
COVID -19 pandemic evolves, Vertex will continue to assess the need for additional actions to 
ensure the safety of all involved in these clinical studies.  
Addendum Vers ion 3.0 summarizes  additional measures taken for these ongoing CF clinical 
studies (see table below) to ensure continued safety.

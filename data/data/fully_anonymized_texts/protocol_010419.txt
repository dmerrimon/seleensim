 Page 2 of 11  		1.0 Objectives / Specific Aims • The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cholesterol/lovastatin versus lovastatin alone to treat porokeratosis. Our working hypothesis is that both topi[INVESTIGATOR_432949]/lovastatin and lovastatin alone are helpful in treating patients with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP).  • Aims: • 1. To evaluate the response to treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_432949]/lovastatin and lovastatin alone in a series of patients with the diagnosis of DSAP. • 2. To characterize lesion patterns following topi[INVESTIGATOR_432950].   2.0 Background Porokeratosis is a premalignant condition with a malignant transformation rate of 7.5%1. Variants include disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP), disseminated superficial porokeratosis, porokeratosis of Mibelli, porokeratosis palmaris et plantaris disseminate, porokeratosis ptychotropi[INVESTIGATOR_19529], and linear porokeratosis.  Porokeratosis is a rare condition involving clonal proliferation of abnormal keratinocytes that can be inherited or acquired. DSAP is the most common type of porokeratosis. It is described as a well circumscribed, erythematous macule with a peripheral rim of hyperkeratosis, also referred to as the coronoid lamella. While typi[INVESTIGATOR_432951], lesions may develop into squamous cell carcinoma or Bowen’s disease1.  The lesions typi[INVESTIGATOR_432952]. DSAP typi[INVESTIGATOR_432953] 30s and 40s who have a history of extensive ultraviolet radiation exposure. It is estimated to occur in a female to male ratio of 1.8:12. The exact pathogenesis for DSAP is currently unknown, however, the mevalonate genetic pathways are suspected to play a role in development. In one study, at least one mutation in the mevalonate pathway was found in 98% of familial cases and 70% of sporadic cases3. Treatment usually consists of destruction of the lesion utilizing cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, carbon dioxide lasers, 5-fluorouracil. However, recent observations have suggested that various porokeratosis variants arise in areas affected by [CONTACT_91307]-hit mutations in genes encoding components of the mevalonate pathway. Consequently, investigators from Yale University successfully treated a series of patients with topi[INVESTIGATOR_432949]/lovastatin which resulted in complete clearance of DSAP lesions after [ADDRESS_548691], while topi[INVESTIGATOR_432954]4.  This study will provide a larger sample size and allow us to observe more definitive outcomes of the stain/cholesterol therapy.  3.[ADDRESS_548692] become an important diagnostic aid for skin cancer detection. Dermoscopy, also known as dermatoscopy, epi[INVESTIGATOR_432955], incident light microscopy, or skin surface microscopy, is performed using a handheld instrument called a 
Version #7.0; Version Date: 10/28/[ADDRESS_548693] magnifying optics (10×). The dermatoscope facilitates visualization of subsurface skin structures located within the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], dermoepi[INVESTIGATOR_211472], and papi[INVESTIGATOR_412990], which are otherwise invisible to the unaided eye. Colors and structures visible with dermoscopy are required for generating a correct diagnosis.  Dermlite dermatoscopes are approved by [CONTACT_1622].   We will utilize 2% cholesterol and 2% lovastatin ointment. It will be compounded by a pharmacist. Ointment will be applied on lesional skin with occlusion twice daily. Cholesterol and lovastatin are not approved by [CONTACT_432965]-label by [CONTACT_432966].  Pharmacology  Cholesterol is an animal sterol found in the body tissues (and blood plasma) of vertebrates. It can be found in large concentrations within the liver, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and brain. Cholesterol is an important component of the membranes of cells, providing stability. Cholesterol is distributed universally in all animal tissues. It can be derived either from intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol or from synthesis de novo within the body. Cholesterol itself in the animal system is the precursor of bile acids, steroid hormones, and provitamin D3.  Lovastatin is a lactone metabolite isolated from the fungus Aspergillus terreus with cholesterol-lowering and potential antineoplastic activities. Lovastatin is hydrolyzed to the active beta-hydroxyacid form, which competitively inhibits 3-hydroxyl-3-methylgutarylcoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition, this agent may induce tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell invasiveness, possibly by [CONTACT_432967], and may arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Studies suggest that less than 5% of the oral dose reaches the general circulation as active inhibitors and the time to peak serum concentration is 2-[ADDRESS_548694]-pass metabolism so the availability of the drug in the system is low and variable. The peak concentrations of lovastatin when a dose of 10-40 mg is administered are reported to range from 1.04-4.03 ng/ml and an AUC of 14-53 ng.h/ml. This indicates that lovastatin presents a dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profile.  Lovastatin is a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that has been used topi[INVESTIGATOR_432956], seborrhoea, rosacea, rhinophyma, atopic dermatitis, contact [CONTACT_432968] (US Patent 5,730,992 1998 and US Patent 6,126,947 2000). Topi[INVESTIGATOR_432957] 49 mM (20 mg/ml) in 95% ethanol is well-tolerated with limited side effects. Muscle breakdown may occur resulting in signs and symptoms such as myalgias, fasciculations, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], myopathy, rhabdomyolysis and increased levels creatine kinases in the blood. The ethanol component may induce mild skin dryness. It was effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris, thus supporting the expectation of absorption through the skin. Lovastatin is known to cause reversible cell cycle arrest and effective concentrations depend on cell type and experimental conditions, but cell culture

If they are interested, the aforementioned study team members will respond to them via email, and subsequently approach the patients virtually without coercion and with the emphasis on the voluntary aspect of being on this study. Subjects will also be told in a caring manner that no matter what their decision is, it will not affect how their doctor cares for them as a patient or their care in general.     9.[ADDRESS_548697], allowing them ample time to review the document before meeting the study team in person or virtually during visit 1 (week 0). During visit 1, the trained study team member performing consent will then review the consent form with them once again and address any questions before the sign the document and return it to the team via email. Virtual consenting will be performed on REDcap. Only trained research team members will be obtaining informed consent. Training will be performed by [CONTACT_432970]. No waiting period will be necessary between informing the subjects and obtaining the consent; however, subjects will be allowed to take home the unsigned consent form for review prior to signing it if needed.  The virtual consent process for patients who contact [CONTACT_432971]: 1. subjects contact [CONTACT_432972] 2. Interested subjects are called by [CONTACT_432973] a prescreening call in which we determine if they are eligible to participate in our study. This is also an

Potential subjects are securely emailed a copy of the IRB-approved ICF and scheduled for an official enrollment video visit that is mutually agreeable for the investigators and potential participant. The time period between this email and the enrollment visit will provide participants ample time to review the ICF in detail so that they have the opportunity to prepare additional questions during the official enrollment visit. 4. Investigators and potential participants engage in a video chat for consenting, in which REDCap will be used for execution of the consent process. Study participants will have the option to have the signed ICF sent to their personal email after it is signed by [CONTACT_49249]. 6. Subsequently, Visit 1 will proceed following the procedures in our protocol   10.0 Study Design / Methods • Potential subjects will be approached for informed consent as directed in sections 8.[ADDRESS_548698] will be administered to these patients to confirm that they can be included in the study. • If the patient is eligible for the study, he or she will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. They will have a 50/50 chance of being in either group. Neither the researchers nor you will make the choice to which group you are assigned.  The two groups are Group A (cholesterol/lovastatin) and Group B (lovastatin only). The patient will not be informed of which group they are in and will not be informed of what their study medication is, allowing single-blinding. Researchers will not be masked. • Enrolled subjects will be followed up at monthly intervals for three months via virtual check-in using an MUSC approved HIPAA compliant technology. At each visit, participants will undergo brief, limited physical examination (in order to determine disease severity and affected body surface area); additionally, clinical photographs of the lesion will be obtained in clinic or shared virtually with the investigators via secure email (sent to MUSC Outlook email). The physical exam will occur in-person or by [CONTACT_432974], which allows us to see the patient and visualize their skin findings.. Photographs will be stored in the coded study-specific medical record for further analysis of lesion features.  • At each visit a Patient Quality of Life, Physician Global Assessment Scale, and Actinic keratosis Field Assessment Scale will be administered.  • Patients will be contact[CONTACT_432975]-in visits at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Patients will be asked about compliance and any adverse effects experienced. Patients are also encouraged to contact [CONTACT_432976]-related side effects. Immediate consultation will follow to determine the severity of such event and necessary impacts on patient health and participation. Participants will also be contact[CONTACT_432977] 2 and 6 of treatment.

They will be prepared so the study will remain single-blinded (only investigators know which study drug they are receiving) and associated costs will not be covered by [CONTACT_432979]. The cost of the medication will be approximately $85 when dispensed by [CONTACT_432980], or $110 when dispensed by [CONTACT_432981]. The differences in costs are attributed to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_432959]. • Both pharmacies will be compounding the drugs to be used in this study, and the compounding formula (recipe) will be identical between these two compounding pharmacies. • Enrollment and prescription drug delivery to other states will not be performed until the respective state pharmacy boards confirm the legality of clinical telehealth interventions and out-of-state pharmacy prescriptions. All state and federal guidelines will be followed according to their regulations and recommendations. • Patient prescriptions will be called in to their respective pharmacies by [CONTACT_432982]. Individual prescriptions will be called in to the aforementioned pharmacies so that the pharmacies can individually ship the medication to the respective participant. Both pharmacies are well aware of the study protocol and procedures for sending the prescription. This will occur by [CONTACT_432983]:  ! 1. The study team member will call the pharmacist to inform them that a participant has been enrolled and ready to receive one of the two single-blinded drugs. The lovastatin/cholesterol combination has been assigned the arbitrary codename “RDC100”, and the lovastatin alone medication has been assigned the arbitrary codename “RDC15”. On the prescription label there will be the codename, application instructions, and storage instructions. ! 2. Per standard procedure of calling in a prescription, the study team member will verbally inform the Tidewater/Chemistry Rx pharmacist of the patient name, birthday, and phone number so that the medication can be prescribed and so that the patient can be contact[CONTACT_432984][INVESTIGATOR_432960].  ! 3. The pharmacist will contact [CONTACT_432985]. ! 4. The subject will inform the study team member upon receival of the medication, confirm that they received the correct, randomized medication.  ! 5. All of the information related to drug disposal and reception will be recorded on the coded Drug Accountability Sheet, which is located separately in the secure box drive.

 Page 8 of 11  • Medications will be able to be shipped to all continental US states by [CONTACT_432981], except Alabama. This is because Chemistry Rx does not have the license to dispense to Alabama. Therefore, any participant reliant upon an Alabama address to receive their medication will not be allowed to participate in this study. • Dermoscopic and clinical photographs will be subsequently analyzed for the presence of cornoid lamella. The team will record any additional dermoscopic or clinicals feature that may arise during the analyses.  • Frequency of dermoscopic and clinical features will be analyzed against clinical involution to find possible predictors.  • Procedures during the day of imaging: The doctor will identify the lesion(s) that will be analyzed. The lesion(s) will be measured and clinical and dermoscopy photographs will be taken. Facial images might be taken to assess lesions on the head area.

 Page 9 of 11  • We are comparing before and after photographs from the same patient, hence we employ analysis by [CONTACT_54959] t-test to compare baseline data with data after treatment. • Coded dermoscopic and clinical photographs may be obtained for further analyses. Files with patient images will be stored in a secure departmental drive that will only be accessible to study team members by [CONTACT_432986]. ! Photos shared directly via email to study team members will be also be uploaded to the participants respective coded folder on the Box drive.  ! These emailed photos (sent by [CONTACT_432987]) must be de-identified close up photos of the participants legs or arms, and sent only to study team members secure MUSC-assigned Outlook email addresses. Photos that do not fit this criteria will be deleted upon receival and not used in the study. • All subject medical record information and data collection will be coded and stored on an MUSC Box drive only accessible to study team members, and will be protected by [CONTACT_1192]-factor authentication. 12.[ADDRESS_548699] during patient’s treatment will require a thorough review of the adverse event by [CONTACT_214297]. Depending on the severity of the adverse event, the participant may be recommended to withdrawal from the study. The research team will continue to follow the patient until resolution of said adverse event has resolved. 2. Upon subject’s verbal notification, the study team will evaluate the adverse event, they will proceed to document it and evaluate for subject safety. They will determine if subject is suitable to continue in the study. 3. Information will be provided about safe discontinuation of the drug and if any clinical review needs to occur. For evaluation and reporting purposes, researchers may conduct an exit interview and ask subjects about the reason for early withdrawal. 4. Subjects can participate in the study as long as they want. Subjects may verbally notify investigators if they wish to voluntarily withdrawal from the study and they will be removed immediately.  13.0 Risks to Subjects • We anticipate minimal side effects and local irritation to be minimal. Muscle toxicity is a known adverse effect of statins. Patients will be notified during enrollment to watch out for common signs and symptoms such myalgias, fasciculations, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], myopathy and increased levels of CK. If an adverse event occurs, the subject must notify the study team members at their earliest convenience. Upon the subject’s verbal notification to the study team, the study team will evaluate the adverse event and will proceed to document it and evaluate for subject safety. They will determine if subject is suitable to continue in the study.

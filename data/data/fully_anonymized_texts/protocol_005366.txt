A. Significance  
A.1.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_351684] .  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]  (OUDs ) are increasing at alarming rates in the United 
States and the prevalence in women is substantial. While the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent men in the US remains 
larger than the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent women, there are some disturbing trends. Between 1999 and 2015 , 
overdose deaths from prescription pain drugs increased 471 percent  in women compared to an increase of 218 
percent  in men (CDC, 201 8). Although nonmedical use of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_351685] 2010 (Jones, 2016) , heroin use among women increased faster  in women than men  and 
between 2002 and 2013, heroin use among women increased 100% compared to an increase of 50% among 
men (Cicero et al., 2014). Disturbingly, there has been an enormous increase in the rates of synthetic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
related deaths , with an 850 percent increase in deaths for women between 1999 and 2015 (CDC, 2018 ).   
 A.2.  Gender Differences in Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) .  There is growing recognition that biological 
and psychosocial differences between men and women influence the prevalence, presentation, comorbidity and treatment of SUDs.   For example, women tend to use smaller amount s of drugs or alcohol for a shorter amount  
of time before seeking treatment, a phenomenon known as “t elescopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” (Brady and Randal, 2007).  A similar 
trend is seen in OUDs; an a nalysis of data from a multisite clinical trial demonstrated that  women progressed to 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_351686] (Back et al., 2011). Women 
with SUDs  are also more likely to have comorbid depression and anxiety disorders (Brady et al., 1993; Brady 
and Randall, 1999) and are more likely to attribute use and relapse to negative emotional states and 
interpersonal conflict (Connors et al., 1998; Back et al., 2011)  as compared to men.  There is also evidence of 
gender differences in neurocognitive and brain responses in drug- dependent individuals . An fMRI study  
examining gender differences in neural correlates of stress - and drug cue exposure found greater corticostriatal -
limbic reactivity in cocaine- dependent  women during stress  exposure , but higher reactivity in these regions 
during drug cue exposure in cocaine- dependent  men suggesting greater neural stress sensitization in women 
(Potenza et al., 2012). Another  study found psychological and emotional distress  were  identified as risk factors 
for hazardous prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_351687], but not men (Back et  al., 2011).  
A.3.  Stress and Relapse: Sex and Gender Differences.  Etiologic theories of SUDs  suggest that s tress plays  
an important role in vulnerability and motivation to abuse addictive substances (Higgins and Marlatt, 1975; Koob 
and LeMoal, 2001; Russell and Mehrabian, 1975) . Animal studies demonstrate that exposure to stress facilitates 
both initiation and reinstatement of drug use after a period of abstinence (Koob et al., 2004; Stewart, 2000) . The 
brain circuitry (including amygdala and hippocampus) underlying cognitive processing of stress is sexually dimorphic in humans and animals (Kudielka and Kirschbaum, 2005) .  In addition, hormonal regulation contributes 
to sexual dimorphism in stress response (Patchev and Almeida, 1998) , with estrogen and progesterone acting 
as modulators of stress regulation (Windle et al., 2006) . Corticotropin -releasing factor (CRF) , an important 
mediator of the stress response through the hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal (HPA) axis and extra- hypothalamic 
systems, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of stress -induced relapse (Koob et al., 2014). P reclinical 
studies have demonstrated significant sex differences in C RF systems. For example, female rodents have higher 
basal levels of CR F in the hypothalamus (Viau et al., 2005; Dunko et al., 2001)  and significantly greater 
adrenocorticotropin hormone ( response)  to CR F (Kuhn and Francis, 1997) . 
 One focus of our previous SCOR work was the neural circuitry and mechanistic connection between 
stress and vulnerability to relapse in cocaine dependence.  Preclinical studies  by [CONTACT_351747]- seeking in rodent models ( Shaham et al., 
2003; Lu et al., 2003) .  Our SCOR group was the first to demonstrate  that female rats are more sensitive to the 
impact of CRF on cocaine reinstatement  compared to male rats ( Buffalari et al., 2012 ). In our human laboratory 
studies, we found higher subjective stress response and greater  HPA axis disruption in cocaine- dependent 
women co mpared to men  (Brady et al., 2009) . Of interest, high stress and craving following CRF administration  
was associated with higher relapse rates in the month following laboratory testing (Back et al., 2010) .   
 In this same study, t he heart rate response following CRF was also more robust and prolonged in women  
(Brady et al., 2009) , suggesting greater noradrenergic activity .  Interactions between the brain’s noradrenergic 
and CRF systems are critical to the stress response  (Koob et al., 2014; McRae et al., 2017) . The noradrenergic  
system is comprised of two main projections  distributed throughout the brain: the dorsal noradrenergic  bundle 
(DNB) originating in the locus coeruleus  (LC) and the ventral noradrenergic bundle (VNB)  in the brain stem.  The 
noradrenergic receptor system is made up of alpha1, alpha2, and beta receptor subtypes  (Berridge and 
Waterhouse, 2003) . Alpha- 2 adrenergic agonists , such as clonidine, guanficine and lofexidine, stimulate 
V20 7.25.23  inhibitory presynaptic  alpha- 2 receptors and decrease norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] ( NE) cell firing and release centrally  
(Aghajanian, 1982).  Preclinical studies indicate significant sex differences in the LC -NE system , including 
increased numbers of LC neurons and differences in dendritic structure , so female rats receive more CRF -
containing afferents from limbic regions (Bangasser  et al., 2016).  In addition, estrogen can increase NE in LC 
target regions by [CONTACT_351748] (Bangasser et al., 2106). Finally, one study 
found that CRF was 10– 30 times more potent in activating LC neurons in female versus  male rats (Curtis et al., 
2006).  
A.4. Sex and gender differences in response to noradrenergic agents.  Preclinical evidence suggests that 
increased NE activity is a mediator of stress -induced reinstatement. Yohimbine, an alpha- [ADDRESS_437278] 
that increases NE release, facilitates reinstatement of cocaine (Feltenstein and See, 2006; Lee et al., 2004) , 
methamphetamine (Shepard et al., 2004) , and alcohol (Le et al., 2005)  seeking.   Our  SCOR group was the first 
to demonstrate that female rats were more sensitive to the impact of yohimbine on cocaine- reinstatement than 
males , with females in proestrus demonstrat ing the greatest  response to yohimbine  (Feltenstein et al., 2011).   
Our SCOR group also demonstrated gender specific sensitivity to noradrenergic dysregulation in cocaine 
dependence using a human laboratory paradigm. In a double- blind placebo- controlled cross -over study of 
yohimbine prior to cocaine cue exposure, wom en reported greater anxiety and craving with  yohimbine compared 
to men (Moran -Santa Maria et al., 2014), suggesting that noradrenergic -mediated stress increased the salience 
of drug cues for women more than men.   
Of interest, alpha- 2 agonists selectively block reinstatement of heroin, cocaine, alcohol and nicotine-
seeking in animal models (Erb et al., 2000 ; Shaham et al., 2000; Highfield et al., 2001; Yamada and Bruijnzeel, 
2011; Le et al., 2005).  Several human laboratory studies have also demonstrated that alpha- 2 agonists decrease 
both stress and cue- induced craving in cocaine-  and nicotine- dependent individuals (Jobes et al., 2011; Fox et 
al., 2012; Fox et al, 2014). One investigation of the impact of guanfacine  on stress and cue- induced response in 
cocaine- dependent men and women found that guanfacine significantly attenuated cocaine and alcohol 
craving, anxiety, and negative emotion in women but not in men (Fox et al., 2014).  A Cochrane review found 
that clonidine treatment for smoking cessation was more effective in women than in men (Gourlay et al., 
2004). In a meta -analysis (n = 813) of clonidine studies for smoking cessation, end- of-treatment quit rates in 
women were 70% for clonidine versus 18% for placebo, whereas men did not demonstrate a medication effect 
(Glassman et al., 1988). McKee and colleagues (2015) found that guanfacine significantly and equally reduced 
the number of cigarettes per day following a quit attempt for men and women over a 4- week treatment period.  
However, guanfacine decreased smoking lapse, cigarettes smoked, and tobacco craving following stress in 
women but  not in men.  Although preliminary, these findings suggest  that interventions that decrease 
noradrenergic activity  may be more efficacious in reducing substance use in women as compared to men due 
to sex differences in stress -related sensitization.  
A.5.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], HPA Axis and Noradrenergic Systems.  In opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561], stress system dysregulation is 
of major significance because of the complex relationships between stress -related neuropeptides  (i.e. CRF) , the 
endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , and the  LC-NE system . The LC –NE system is reciprocally regulated by [CONTACT_351749][INVESTIGATOR_351688]  (Curtis et al., 2001; Kawara  et al., 2000; Valentino and Van Bockstaele 2001; 2013) . Preclinical 
studies demonstrate that chronic morphine sensitizes the LC -NE system to CRF expressed as increased 
sensitivity of the neurons to stress, providing a potential mechanism to link opi[INVESTIGATOR_351689] -sensitive 
disorders (Xu et al., 2004). As detailed above, there is substantial pre- clinical evidence indicating sex differences 
in these systems, but these differences have not been specifically explored with regard to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].   
 There is some lack of consistency in s tudies of HPA axis function in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561].  As expected 
because opi[INVESTIGATOR_351690], ACTH and cortisol are reduced 
during heroin exposure  and early studies demonstrated normalization of HPA axis function during methadone 
maintenance ( Kreek et al., 2002; Kreek et al., 198 3). More recent studies have demonstrated some persistent 
alterations in HPA axis activity  in methadone- maintained individuals , including increas ed sensitivity to high dose 
CRH administration (Schulger et al. , 2003) and decreased cortisol and CRF levels  (Zhang et al., 2009) , 
suggesting suppressed HPA axis function. Although the impact of buprenorphine maintenance on HPA axis 
function has not been as thoroughly explored, one study using a met yrapone challenge suggested suppressed 
HPA axis function in individuals  on buprenorphine maintenance ( Kakko et al., 2008).  It is clear , however,  that 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] w ithdrawal engages CRF and other stress -systems, including noradrenergic pathways, and is associated 
with anxiety and dysphoria (Schulger et al., 2003). Several studies  have demonstrated that increased cortisol 
during opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351] i s positively correlated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506] ( Nava et al., 2008; Shi et al., 2009).    
V20 7.25.[ADDRESS_437279] shown to ameliorate 
some signs and symptoms of opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351]  (Gold et al., 1978 ) and is now used in opi[INVESTIGATOR_9734].   
Although clonidine is traditionally  used only for opi[INVESTIGATOR_9734], Kowalczyk and colleagues  (2015) conducted 
a randomized double- blind, placebo- controlled relapse prevention trial of adjunctive clonidine treatment in 118 
OUD men and women on buprenorphine. The rationale for the trial was based on preclinical reinstatement 
studies  cited above ( Erb et al., 2000; Shaham et al., 2000; Highfield et al., 2001) .   To preserve consistency  with 
the preclinical models,  a relapse prevention model requiring a period of abstinence before enter ing the 
medication treatment portion of the trial was used as preclinical data suggests that cessation of on -going drug 
use is mediated by [CONTACT_351750] (Shalev et al, 2002; 
Kalivas and Volkow, 2005).  Ecologic momentary assessment (EMA) was used during the 14- week trial to query 
participants about daily life stress and craving.  The clonidine- treated group had a significantly longer duration of 
abstinence as compared to the placebo group. EMA assessment demonstrated that daily life stress was partly 
decoupled from opi[INVESTIGATOR_351691], supporting the hypothesis that cl onidine exerted its  
beneficial effects by [CONTACT_351751]. The number of women in the sample was not large enough to 
support gender -specific data analysis. Of interest, in studies using a preclinical model of polysubstance abuse, 
methadone blocked cocaine and heroin -induced reinstatement, but not stress -induced reinstatement (Leri et al., 
2004; Sorge et al., 2005 ).     
 Lofexidine, also an alpha- [ADDRESS_437280] 
comparable efficacy in reducing withdrawal, with a better risk -benefit profile for lofexidine including better 
tolerability and less hypotension (Kahn et al., 1997; Lin et al., 1997;  Carnwath and Hardman, 1998; Gowling et 
al, 2016).  In a study of 18 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent individuals stabilized on naltrexone (NTX) , treatment with lofexidine  
versus placebo was tested (Sinha et al., 2007).  During the 4 -week treatment  period, the l ofexidine- NTX patients 
had higher abstinence rates and improved relapse outcomes as compared to the placebo– NTX group.  Ten 
subjects participated in a human laboratory stress/drug cue exposure paradigm .  The lofexidine– NTX patients 
had significantly lower  heart rate and attenuated stress and drug cue response as compared to  the placebo–
NTX group. The sample size did not support a gender -specific analysis in this study .  As in the study by 
[CONTACT_351752] (2015), participants were stabilized on NTX before i nitiation of study medications,  
making this a relapse prevention study.  Following these two positive clinical studies and based on the preclinical 
data, we will use a relapse prevention model in this study requiring a period of abstinence before the medication 
treatment period.   
 In sum, alterations in the stress response and noradrenergic system are important in pathophysiology of 
OUD. Alpha- [ADDRESS_437281] commonly used in the [LOCATION_002] for opi[INVESTIGATOR_9734]  
(Gowing et al., 2009) . We will utilize a novel dual -level approach by [CONTACT_351753] a laboratory paradigm and on ambient stress , craving and stress cues occurring 
over the course of a clinical trial. In the latter case, we will use innovative mobile technology to allow for 
assessment of craving, stress and stress -cue reactivity in the “day to day” natural environment  before, during 
and after treatment in  individuals with OUD. We will also assess medication compliance using an innovative 
video capture procedure .  These approaches represent a highly innovative “next step” in the development of 
personalized, gender -specific treatment  for individuals with OUD.  
 
C. APPROACH 
C.1. Preliminary Studies 
C.1.a. Capacity of Research Team. The proposed research requires experience in: 1.) recruitment, retention, 
and assessment of OUD individuals, 2.) human laboratory stress induction procedures,  3.) collection and 
interpretation of neuroendocrine and physiologic  measurements, 4.) ambulatory assessments, and 5 .) clinical 
trial conduct and follow -up of individuals with SUDs. As detailed below, the multidisciplinary research team has 
the requisite expertise to successfully conduct the proposed work and a proven track -record. The proposed 
project will be co- directed by [CONTACT_6283]. Kathleen Brady and Connie Guille. [CONTACT_335437]  is a Distinguished University 
Professor with a 30-year history  of successful conduct of clinical trials and human laboratory studies in individuals 
with SUDs. [CONTACT_351801] ’s research focus is perinatal OUD , incuding the ultization of EMA to identify 
predict ors of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].  Drs. Brady and Guille have been collaborators for the past decade . [CONTACT_351802] is a 
board- certified Addiction Psychiatrist with specific interest s in chronic pain management, the interface of pain 
and addictions , and gender differences in OUDs. [CONTACT_351803] McCauley  is a licensed clinical psychologist with 
experience in assessment of early life trauma and opi[INVESTIGATOR_351692], as well as clinical trial conduct and follow -up 
of individuals with SUDs.  Importantly, these  investigators have been working closely together over the  past [ADDRESS_437282] 20 years as part of the NIDA -funded 
clinical trials network ( DA013727). The Charleston Center is a public treatment program located [ADDRESS_437283] (described below). In addition, this team is  currently 
leading a multi -pronged statewide effort  focused on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_351693] a component focused 
on providing buprenorphine and rapid access to treatment for OUD patients presenting in emergency rooms 
(ERs) . In the MUSC ER, they have identified [ADDRESS_437284], SC  works closes with DAODAS to provide medication- assisted treatment to residents of Horry County.  
With these multiple recruitment sites , we anticipate no difficulties meeting recruitment goals for the proposed 
study.  
C.1.c. Stress Induction Procedures  and Neuroendocrine/Physiologic Measurement . [CONTACT_335437] has 
conducted a number of human laboratory studies involving stress  induction and drug cue exposure in alcohol, 
cocaine and nicotine dependence (Brady et al., 2009; Moran et al., 2014; Hartwell et al., 2011; Brady et al., 
2006).  Of direc t relevance, Drs. Brady and colleagues  completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_143388] a human laboratory 
stress task in 39 (N=19 women; 20 men) individuals with OUD.  Subjects were randomly assigned to either the 
Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; n=19) or no -stress control (no stress; n=20) followed by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_351694]. 
Distress tolerance, Inventory of Drug Taking Situations and Tim e-line Follow -back were completed  at baseline. 
Self-reported visual analog scale ratings of stress  and craving, as well as heart rate and salivary  cortisol were 
assessed immediately before and at multiple time point s for [ADDRESS_437285]/ drug cue exposure.  
Individuals were followed for one month after the  laboratory session to assess opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (Time -line Follow -
Back ) and daily stress. Significant  group (TSST vs. no stress) differences emerged in self -reported stress 
[F(1,35)=41.77, p<.001], anger [F(1,35)=13.00, p<.001], sadness [F(1,35)=4.78, p<.05], cortisol and heart rate 
V20 7.25.23  (HR) [F(1,35)=5.28, p<.05], with the TSST group exhibiti ng more reactivity. Women demonstrated significantly 
greater self -reported stress [F(1,35)=11.24, p<.01], (Figure 1);  however, they exhibited significantly less cortisol  
response following the TSST as compared to men. Data (Figure 2) are shown as log [ADDRESS_437286] compared to men; it had not returned to baseline by [CONTACT_2671] 
1 hour follow- up period (Figure 3)  suggesting greater  
noradrenergic stimulation in women.  This finding is similar 
to the gender -specific pattern of response seen in 
cocaine- dependent individuals in an earlier SCOR study 
(Brady et al., 2009). Women in this study reported 
significantly more daily hassles and used opi[INVESTIGATOR_39938] a 
higher percentage of days in the one -mont h follow -up 
period as compared to men (Table 1) . In addition, lower 
distress tolerance, measured at baseline, was significantly 
associated with a higher   percentage of  opi[INVESTIGATOR_351695] (b=17.01, p=.013), but not for men. In 
summary, these data suggest   that OUD women 
demonstrate greater subjective and noradrenergic stress 
response than OUD men. The pattern of low cortisol  and 
high subjective response to stress exhibited by [CONTACT_351754] (Back et al., 2010) .  Furthermore, women reported lower distress tolerance, higher 
experience of daily hassles and a robust relationship between low distress tolerance and drug use. Taken 
together, these preliminary findings suggest that 
an intervention targeting stress vulnerability, 
particularly through blockade of noradrenergic 
activation, may be particularly effec tive in relapse 
prevention for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent women.    
C.1.d. Experience with Ambulatory 
Assessments. During the last funding period, the 
MUSC SCOR research group developed 
ambulatory assessment tools to assess stress reactivity and drug craving, collect data on drug use and withdrawal symptoms, v alidate abstinence, and 
measure/ encourage medication adherence. The Cue Reactivity Ecological Momentary Assessment  (CREMA)  
paradigm  was modified to assess cue - and stress -related nicotine craving (Wray et al., 2015). Over 80% of 
CREMA sessions were successfully completed (Tomko et al., 2017), supporting the feasibility of remote 
collection of this type of  data. We also capi[INVESTIGATOR_351696] -report of drug use and video confirmation of medication adherence (Tomko et al., in press). In a 
smoking cessation trial, there was high compliance with video (73.8%) and self -report (74.8%)  completion.  All

REDCap assessments t o traditional, paper measures. In an ongoing pharmacotherapy trial for cannabis use 
disorder  (UG3DA04323), we have observed  high compliance with video uploads for medication adherence, with 
a median of 80% of medication doses verified.  
C.2. Research Design and Methods. T his project  is a double- blind, placebo- controlled trial to assess gender 
differences in the impact of lofexidine, an alpha -[ADDRESS_437289], on stress -related opi[INVESTIGATOR_351697] . Following this  period, participants will be 
randomized to receive either lofexidine or placebo for a 5-week period during which cue reactivity ecological 
momentary assessment  (CREMA ) will be used to assess stress levels, craving and drug use and video 
confirmation of medication adherence will be employed. Naturalistically collected stress and drug cue reactivity 
data will be complemented by [CONTACT_17814] a validated laboratory stress (the Trier Social Stress Task)  and 
drug cue exposure procedure at  the end of the 5-week treatment period while participants are still taking study 
medications. A schematic of study procedures is shown below.  
C.2.a. Participants.  A total of 136 participants  (68 men and 68 women ) with OUD who have been on a stable dose 
of buprenorphine or methadone for at least 2  weeks , aged 18 to 6 5 years of age, will be recruited over a 54 -
month period. Additional inclusion criteria are consent to random assignment, ability to read and provide informed 
consent  and willingness to remain abstinent from illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_82494] 1-week  baseline assessment period. 
Contingency management procedures (described below) will be used to facilitate the maintenance of abstinence 
during this period.  Exclusion criteria are  women who are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant 
during the course of the study; having a history of or current major psychiatric or medical disorder; hypotension 
or QTc  prolongation on EKG ; and meeting criteria for moderate or severe use disorder for another substance 
with the exception of nicotine. A detailed list of inclusion/exclusion criteria can be found below.  
C.2.b. Recruitment.  MUSC staff will recruit participants from the Charleston Center ,, MUSC and community 
addiction treatment programs , Shoreline Behavioral Health, and through media advertisement s As noted in 
C.1.b., we have a long and successful track record of recruiting from these programs for clinical trials , and the 
numbers of patients on buprenorphine or methadone maintenance at both sites are more than adequate for 
recruitment of the required four participants per month to meet the study timeline.   
 
C.2.c. Procedures  
C.2.c.1. Ensur ing a Robust and Unbiased Approach: Rigor and Transparency. The proposed study will 
achieve robust and unbiased results via several design features including: explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria; randomization of treatment condition; placebo control; blinding; use of validated laboratory and interview/self -
report measures and methods; explicit hypotheses and planned statistical analyses; power estimates; management  of retention/attrition and missing data; and careful consideration of potential confounds. All 
experimental details are reported in a detailed and fully t ransparent manner to support replication.  
C.2.c.2. Screening and Eligibility Assessment.  Individuals interested in participating will be screened by [CONTACT_351755] , MUSC/community  treatment program , 
Shoreline Behavioral Health or over the phone   A quick screen , focused on inclusion/exclusion diagnoses, 
medical status, medication regimen, and ability/willingness to complete assessments and study procedures,  will 
be used to initially determine study eligibility. Potential participants will be given a full description of study 
procedures and asked to read and sign an IRB -approved Informed Consent Form if they choose to participate. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria are detailed below.  
Inclusion Criteria:  1.) Able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual level sufficient to allow 
accurate completion of assessment instruments. 2.) Meet DSM -5 criteria for OUD (within the past three months) ; 
while individuals may also meet criteria for another substance use disorder, they must not meet criteria for 
moderate or severe use of any other substance (except tobacco or marijuana) within the last 60 days.   3.) On a Assessment

enrollment.  8.) Known allergy to lofexidine.   
C.2.c3. Screening and Diagnostic Instruments.  Quick Screen: The instrument is designed to assess for 
substance dependence and obvious psychiatric, medical, and logistic exclusions. Mini-International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I ) is a brief structured int erview designed to assess DSM -5 diagnoses using 
a series of questions in dichotomous format (yes/no). T he M.I.N.I. is similar in sensitivity, specificity, and inter -
rater reliability to other lengthier diagnostic interviews, such as the SCID -I/P (Sheehan & Lecrubier, 2003; 
Sheehan et al., 1998). The alcohol and drug use disorder modules will be used to thoroughly assess current and 
lifetime diagnostic status for abuse and dependence. It has excellent inter -rater and test -retest reliability (First et 
al., 2002). Menstrual History Diary will be used for female participants  to estimate the timing of their cycle for 
the 90 -days prior to study entry and track during study participation. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS ) is a 10- item 
assessment of daily stress (Cohen et al., 1983) that has previously been used in substanc e use research (Fox 
et al., 2009; Hyman et al., 2007). Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Questionnaire assesses childhood 
maltreatment and exposure to household dysfunction. It has been utilized to examine the relationship between 
adverse childhood experiences and health risk behavior in adulthood (Felitti et al., 1998).  The Life Stressor 
Checklist -Revised  (LSC -R; Wolfe & Kimerling, 1997) will be used to assess for the number of exposures to 
various potentially traumatic life events including accidents, interpersonal violence, and death of a relative. Participants will answer yes or no for [ADDRESS_437290] Scale: [ADDRESS_437291] occurred as a result of the coronavirus (Stoddard & Kaufman, 2020). We will 
also ask how substance use has been impacted . 
 
Substance- Related Instruments.  Time Line Follow -back (TLFB; Sobell & Sobell, 1992)  is a calendar -based 
instrument designed to assess daily substance consumption. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_351698], type of opi[INVESTIGATOR_351699]. Urine Drug Screening: Urine samples will be 
collected and analyzed for prescribed and illicit drugs at ba seline and at each study visit.  All urine specimens will 
be analyzed using drug test cups with temperature- controlled monitoring. Drug test cups with immunoassay drug 
screen cards will be used to identify the following substances : oxycodone, buprenorphine, methadone, tramadol, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] , Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] 300 group analytes (morphine, heroin, and codeine), THC, cocaine, amphetamine, 
methamphetamine, ethyl glucuronide, fentanyl, K2,  and  MDMA . Other drugs may be detected by [CONTACT_351756]. For example, hydroc odone may be  detected under the oxycodone test at high 
concentration levels. The cups also include adulterant testing for creatinine, nitrite, pH, bleach and specific gravity.    Saliva drug screening: Saliva drug screens will be obtained from Forensic Fluids and will test for THC, 
cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], methadone, oxycodone, buprenorphine,  and fentanyl . Patients will collect 
and store samples which will be returned to the clinic and sent to Forensic Fluids in batches. Samples will be 
de-identified. Inventory of Drug- Taking Situations (IDTS) (Annis et al., 1997)  measures typi[INVESTIGATOR_351700]’s (1985) eight category taxonomy. This instrument will be used at baseline and contains eight subscales mappi[INVESTIGATOR_351701] (unpleasant emotions) and pos itive situations (social situations).  Although initially 
developed for alcohol use, it has been modified for other SUDs  and has demonstrated sensitivity to gender 
V20 7.25.23  differences (Ross et al., 1994).  Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) (Cleeland & Ryan, 1994). Assesses severity of pain 
and impact on functioning. This measure will be completed at screening and at the end of treatment.  
 
An EKG and  physical exam including orthostatic hypotension testing will be conducted by a licensed medical 
provider. Serum will be collected for baseline labs and a UDS will be collected.  If the participant is female, a 
pregnancy test will be done prior the urine drug screen. Females who are pregnant will not be allowed to participate.  Participants at Shoreline will have labs drawn by [CONTACT_351757].  
 
C2.c4.. Remote screening visit:. Patients may also complete the initial visit remotely if warranted. In this case, 
subjects will be electronically consented using Doxy.me or RedCap or a combination. The informed consent will 
be emailed to the participant prior to the video call. The patient will have the opportunity to ask questions on the 
call and will electronically sign the document. A signed copy will be emailed to the participant. The M.I.N.I 
interview and medical history then be conducted, also via Doxy.me Patients will be advised to find a private 
location during these procedures to protect privacy and confidentiality. Patients will be sent survey links to complete self -report questionnaires.The blood draw, EKG and orthostatic BP will be done at Baseline.  A physical 
exam may be done if it is warranted based on medical history. Urine drug screening and pregnancy testing will 
not be done until baseline for participants who screen remotely.  
 
 
C.2.c. 5. Phase 1:  Baseline and Medication Trial  
a. Initial Study Visit .  Participants will be train ed to use CREMA and the one- week naturalistic baseline data 
collection period will begin following screening procedures . If it is determined that patient is ineligible based on 
labwork, they will be excluded and baseline procedures will end.   
b.  Baseline Assessment (Study days 1 -7). Throughout this  study period, participants will come to the clinic 
for UDS collection.  To facilitate opi[INVESTIGATOR_351702], we will use a standard contingency -
management procedure. Participants will earn payments of  $[ADDRESS_437292] negative UDS and $[ADDRESS_437293] to 
enter the medication treatment part of the trial.  D uring the baseline assessment period, participants will be asked 
to use CREMA  (described below) .  Subjects may have up to 10 days to provide the negative UDSs.  
c. CREMA Assessment.  Cue Reactivity Ecological Momentary Assessment (CREMA; Warthen & Tiffany, 2009; 
Wray, Godleski, & Tiffany, 2011; Wray et al., 2015) can collect subjective ratings of stress, craving, etc.  either 
without provocation or using  photos from the International Affective Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2980] (IAPS; Lang, Bradley, & 
Cuthbert, 2008) presented on a mobile electronic device (iPhone). If an individual does not have an iPhone or 
does not wish to use his/her own for the study, a phone will be provided. Participants will be ins tructed to keep 
their phone with them at all times. Participants will complete a daily survey about substance use and stressful life 
events over the previous 24 hours.  Auditory alarms will alert participants to complete one  randomly scheduled 
session per day  to rate stress, craving and mood. This visual analog scale is anchored with adjectival modifiers 
(“not at all, mildly, moderately, and extremely”). The scale includes items assessing anxiety, stress, irritability, 
and craving.   Participants will also be alerted to daily random CREMA sessions  including IAPS pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] ; session 
will randomly include neutral  IAPS pi[INVESTIGATOR_351703] s (described below).  Iindividuals  be 
presented  one of  two types of pi[INVESTIGATOR_351704]: stress -related (i.e., a child in distress) or 
neutral (i.e., sunglasses). Each pi[INVESTIGATOR_351705].  Participant s will be instructed to 
look at the photo  carefully for [ADDRESS_437294] -cue rating scale assessment, ratings of how carefully they looked at the photographs and their distraction 
level. Using this strategy, we can assess ambient emotional state and craving as well as “evoked” response to 
stressful cues.   To encourage CREMA session completions, participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_437295] reported 85- 90% 
completion rates (Gass et al., 2011; Warthen et al., 2009), including in our previous SCOR  work  (Wray et al., 
2015).  
d. Lofexidine/Placebo Titration Procedures (Days 8- 17). After two consecutive negative drugs screens have 
been obtained, participant s will be randomly assigned to study medication  (lofexidine or matching placebo).  For 
the Shoreline site, medication will be dispensed by [CONTACT_351758].  At the 
randomization visit, females will provide saliva samples for estradiol and progesterone testing. Trained study  
personnel will evaluate heart rate, orthostatic blood pressure, and pre- syncope and syncope signs and 
symptoms prior to the initiation of Lofexidine. Lofexidine will not be dispensed if the participant is found to have 
V20 7.25.23  one of the following on physical exam: 1) clinically significant bradycardia as determined by [CONTACT_70852]; 2) 
orthostatic hypotension defined as a systolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20mm Hg or a diastolic blood 
pressure decrease of at least 10mm Hg within three minutes of standing; 3) participant endorsement of pre-
syncope symptoms such as lightheadedness, muscular weakness, blurred vision, or feeling faint during the 
evaluation of orthostatic blood pressure; or 4)  syncope ( fainting) during the evaluation of orthostatic blood 
pressure. Participants with bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, pre -syncope or syncope would be terminated 
from the study and study staff will facilitate appropriate follow -up medical care.  To minimize risks of hypotension, 
lofexidine will be titrated over a 10-day period with 0. 36 mg QDfor day s 1 and 2; 0. 36 mg BID for days 3 and 4; 
0.36 mg TID for days 5 and 6; 0.36 mg BID and 0.72 QD days 7 and 8; 0.[ADDRESS_437296] of the study  (see Table 2) . This is the dose recommended 
by [CONTACT_351759] 8

orthostatic hypotension, or pre -syncope or syncope signs or symptoms as defined above, the dose of Lofexidine 
will be increased according to the titration schedule ( Table 2). If bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, or 
signs/symptoms of pre -syncope or syncope are identified at any point, the dose of Lo fexidine will be lowered to 
the prior tolerated Lofexidine dose and the participant will remain at that dose for the duration of the study. At 
the beginning of the study, participants will be given a rescue pack of 36 tablets in case visits are missed. This 
will cover 3 days at the full dose.  
The medical provider will inform the participant, verbally and with a take- home  hand -out, of common side 
effects of lofexidine (dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth ) and precautions to minimize risks associated with 
blood pressure (BP)  decreases (hydration, standing up slowly). Participants will attend study visits three times 
a week  during the induction period and throughout the study during which a UDS will be collected. The MUSC 
Investigational Drug Service will be responsible for randomization, will keep a record of the blind and will be 
available should unblinding be required. In the event that WorldMeds is unable to supply matching placebo.  
lofexidine tablets (supplied by [CONTACT_351760]) will be encapsulated along with matching placebo capsules by 
[CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_351706], a specialty compounding pharmacy.  Randomization will be stratified on 
presence/absence of other substance use as well as the presence/absence of significant childhood trauma 
(ACE>4).  
e. Medication  maintenance and adherence monitoring (Days 18 -40). Trained study  personnel will evaluate 
heart rate, orthostatic blood pressure, pre -syncope and syncope signs and symptoms once per week following 
the Lofexidine titration. If bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, or signs/symptoms of pre- syncope or syncope 
are identified at any point, the dose of Lofexidine will be lowered to the prior tolerated Lofexidine dose and the 
participant will remain at that dose for the duration of the study. Participa nts will record themselves taking their 
medications  A survey link will be sent to the participant’s cell phone vi a app alert two to three times  daily, 
depending on where they are in the medication schedule.  Video capture will occur through the CREMA app . The 
research coordinator will review the subjects’ videos before each study visit.  As discussed, we have used this 
V20 7.25.23  technology successfully for medication adherence monitoring. To encourage compliance, participants will 
receive $10 for each day that they complete their medication adherence videos.  
f. Intervention phase (Study Days 1 8-40). During the 5 -week medication phase, s tudy participants will come in 
three times per week for UDS s. Blood pressure and pulse will be assessed at each  visit. If the SBP < 90 mmHg 
and > 20% below screening value and/or DBP is < 50 mmHg and >20% below screening value, or the individual is complaining of symptoms of hypotension, the medication dosage will be reduced.  If these symptoms do not resolve, the individual will be removed from the study and followed until vital signs normalize. EKG’s will be 
performed at Weeks 4 and 6 to monitor QT intervals.   A contingency -management procedure will be implemented 
to facilitate study visit adherence. The payment s will start at $4 and increase by $4 for each consecutive visit.  
g. Virtual monitoring : In order to reduce face- to-face visits  when necessary, remote monitoring may be done 
during the medication phase. At the randomization visit, patients will be given a wrist blood pressure cuff for at 
home monitoring, and they will be trained in testing orthostatic blood pressure. Pati ents will come to the clinic 
once a week for a UDS, to me et with staff/medical personnel and have ave orthostatic testing done, and receive 
medication refills . Two weekly visits will be conducted via Telehealth. Patients will be observed doing a saliva 
drug screen and doing orthostatic blood pressure testing. If patients are symptomatic  or having difficulty with 
telehealth procedures , they may be asked to attend the clinic more frequently.  Participants who are not 
comfortable with telehealth procedures may choose to attend clinic visits instead.   
C.2.c.5. Phase Two: Scripted Opi[INVESTIGATOR_351707] (Day s 39 and 40). At 
the end of  the five-week period of 
lofexidine or placebo administration, 
participants will return to complete a 
scripted opi[INVESTIGATOR_351708] a 
laboratory stress task (Trier Social Stress 
Test, TSST) . Tasks will be 
counterbalanced. Subjects will remain on 
study medications for the test  days. 
Subjects who miss their scheduled visits 
may be re -scheduled for up to one week.  
a.Session Preparation.  Participants will 
be instructed to arrive at 8 :00am on the 
test day s, and to avoid caffeinated 
beverages since caffeine can introduce variability in heart rate response. If the 
individual is nicotine- dependent, (s)he will 
be provided with a nicotine patch  
throughout their study visit. Upon arrival, 
the participant will be breathalyzed and 
will provide a urine sample to be tested for drugs of abuse . For women, a pregnancy test will be done prior to 
the urine drug screen, and saliva will be collected for estrogen and progesterone measurement.   
b.Progesterone and Estrogen.   As there is significant individual variability in progesterone and estrogen levels 
across the menstrual cycle, measure ment of  progesterone and estrogen at the time of testing in combination 
with the menstrual cycle history will allow us to approximate the menstrual cycle phase  as well as  to utilize all 
participants’ data with absolute progesterone and estrogen levels as continuous measures.  
c. Design timing . Subjects will first undergo a progressive relaxation task . Baseline assessments of subjective, 
hormonal (cortisol), and physiologic measures (blood pressure and heart rate) will be collected following 
relaxation,  5 minutes before the stressor or imagery; TSST takes 15 minutes, and the imagery takes 5 minutes . 
At the end of the stressor of drug cue, a salivary sample will be collected to assay cortisol and physiological 
(blood pressure and heart rate) and subjective measures ( Mood  Rating Scale, Opi[INVESTIGATOR_351709], 
STAI)  will be  obtained. Measurements wil l also be obtained at [ADDRESS_437298] -task.   
d. Trier Social Stress Task (TSST)  is a standardized psychological stress challenge which has been used 
extensively in research studies. A meta -analysis supports its utility for evoking a HPA axis stress response in a 
laboratory setting (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004) . It has induced  a robust and reliable physiological stress Test Day 1 TABLE 3: LAB TESTING TIMELINE

McRae -Clark et al., 2011; Waldrop et al., 2010). At test initiation , the participant is told that (s)he will give a 
speech and perform an arithmetic task. The topic of the speech will be why (s)he should be hired for a particular 
job (the individual’s “dream job”). The participant will deliver the speech as though speaking to a group of 
potential employers. The experimenter then tells the participant that (s)he has 5 minutes to prepare the speech 
and starts the countdown clock (placed in view of the individual). The experimenter leaves the room and f ive 
minutes later, three individuals unfamiliar to the participant (the audience) enter the room; the individual is  
instructed by [CONTACT_351761]/her prepared speech (without notes). The speech 
will be delivered for 5 minutes. If the individual pauses, (s)he will be instructed to continue. At the end of the 
speech task, the indiv idual will be instructed to serially subtract [ADDRESS_437299] the individual to stop and be seated, and the audience leaves the room.  
e. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_351711] .  We are using a scripted imagery  paradigm  developed by [CONTACT_351762]  (2012). A 
script will be developed based on staff interviews with subjects about a time they craved and used opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. The 
5-minute script will be audio -recorded and played back to the subject during the task.  Subjects will be asked to 
listen and imagine the task as if they are there.   
f. Assessments.   Self -Report Measures.  Mood Rating Scale:   As described above and used with the CREMA 
sessions, to allow for cross -task comparisons. State -Trait Inventory (STAI):  The STAI is a 20- item self -report 
scale (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2996], 1983) employing a Likert -scale format with four responses per item (1 -4). Ten of the STAI 
items measure feelings of stress and anxiety, while the remaining ten items measure feelings of relaxation. The  
STAI has good psychometric properties. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_351712] a Likert scale format.  We 
have had good success wi th this in prior studies in OUDs  (Back et al., 2014)  Physiological  Measures.  Heart rate 
and blood pressure will be measured using an intermittently inflatable cuff as indices of physiological arousal 
during the test session. Hormonal Measures.  Cortisol:  Cortisol will be measured in unstimulated passive saliva 
using the Salimetrics expanded range, high sensitivity salivary cortisol enzyme immunoassay kit. This kit has a 
lower sensitivity level of <0.003 µg/dL. The correlation between salivary and serum cortisol has been shown to 
be high (r=0.91, p<0.0001). Cortisol is commonly measured as an indication of stress response in human 
laboratory studies.  
Modifications may be made to lab day procedures if necessary for patient and staff safety, ie fewer confederates, 
remote procedures.  
 
g. Discharge.  Following assessment s, participants will be given instructions to taper their lofexidine over the 
next five days.  A member of the research staff will be available to discuss management of any craving or urges 
to use any substance if craving remains elevated at the end of study procedures.    
C.2.c.6. Follow- up Assessment (Days 41-47). During a one- week  follow- up period, lofexidine will be tapered ... 
They will  come to the two times during the taper  for BP monitoring (0.72 BID  for two days, 0.36 mg BID for 2 
days, 0.36 QD for 1 day) .  After  five days, participants will return to the clinic  and return  clinic -provided phones, 
complete a questionnaire regarding their experience with the CREMA and REDCap surveys, and be provided 
referrals to treatment if interested.  
Participant Compensation:  Participants will be compensated $40 for completing the screening visit , and an 
additional $[ADDRESS_437300] time they are scheduled.  They will receive $20 for the 
CREMA training  and a $[ADDRESS_437301] baseline visit as scheduled. .They will receive $ 10.00  
for each day that all CREMA session s are completed. During the opi[INVESTIGATOR_351713], participants can earn 
a total of $ 30 for completing drug testing (2 negative UDS compenstated at $10 and $20). During the medication 
period, subjects can receive up to  $10 for each day they complete medication videos  and $364 
($4+$8+$12+$16+$20+$24+$28+$32+$36+$40+$44+$48+ $52) for completing study visits with UDS. 
Participants will be compensated $10 for each blood pressure check during the tapering phase.  Participants will 
also be compensated $50 for completion of each human laboratory  session , a $50 bonus for completing both  as 
scheduled, and $100  for the follow -up. follow- up visit, for a total potential compensation of $ 819 per participant  
plus earnings from CREMA and medication videos.  Participants will be asked to complete a W -9. This document 
may be completed in person or via Doxy.me.  
Confidentiality:  Confidentiality of all research data will be maintained by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_56568] a locked file, limiting 
access to the computer database to only study personnel, and by [CONTACT_351763].   
V20 7.25.23   
C.2.d. Statistical Analysis  and Data Management  
Data Management and Reduction:  All paper -based assessments (other than laboratory reports) will be entered 
into REDCap , a secure, web- based application designed exclusively to support data capture for research 
studies. REDCap provides an intuitive interface for data entry (with data validation), audit trails for tracking data manipulation, and automated export procedures for data downloading to statistical packages such as SPSS and 
SAS. Quarterly database management and data integrity audits will be co nducted and reports submitted.  
Statistics and Data Analysis (complete statistical/data analysis plan in Biostatistics Resource Core ): 
Aim 1:  Using a human laboratory paradigm, determine the impact of lofexidine on stress and drug cue-
induced craving in women and men with OUDs :  The primary study outcome of interest in Aim 1 is the 
differential craving, stress and anxiety response to a human laboratory paradigm s containing both a stressor 
(TSST) and an opi[INVESTIGATOR_351714]/methadone maintenance.  Hypothesis 1: Lofexidine will attenuate drug craving and subjective 
stress response to a stress task in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent individuals compared to individuals receiving placebo. 
Hypothesis 2:   Lofexidine will attenuate drug craving and subjective stress response to a drug -related cue in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent individuals. Hypothesis 3:  The ameliorative effects of lofexidine on stress and cue- reactivity 
will be more pronounced in females than male subjects. To assess the hypothesis that lofexidine will attenuate 
drug craving and subjective stress response to the stressor and the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related cue task, multilevel 
longitudinal GLMMs will be developed using all post -stressor and post -cue data.  Initial models will control for 
study design aspects such as order ( stressor or cue first), treatment assignment, and baseline craving and stress 
(task level).  Covariate adjusted models will additionally include baseline characteristics determined to be 
correlated with study outcomes or those determined to be significant effect modifiers.  To examine the differential 
effects of lofexidine on stress and cue- reactivity across female and male subjects, the models will have additional 
parameters added to include an indicator of participant gender  and the interaction between gender  and 
randomized treatment assignment.  Relevant interactions will be assessed in all models.  Least square means 
and associated standard errors will be assessed to compare craving and subjective stress response between treatment assignments at all time points.   
Aim 2:  To evaluate the impact of lofexidine on opi[INVESTIGATOR_351715] :  The primary measures of interest for Aim 2 are craving and stress ratings in 
response to stress -related cues using Cue Reactivity Ecological Momentary Assessment (CREMA) as well as 
subjective experiences of daily life stressors  Hypothesis 1: Lofexidine will decrease craving and decrease the 
subjective experience of daily stressors in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent men and women.   Exploratory Hypothesis 2: 
Lofexidine will be more efficacious in decreasing stress -related craving in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent women as compared 
to men.  To assess this hypothesis a multilevel generalized linear mixed effects models with repeated measures 
(GLMMs) will be developed using CREMA session response data from the [ADDRESS_437302] of gender  on opi[INVESTIGATOR_351716] -
related craving dur ing study treatment.  All other relevant interactions will be assessed in all models.   
Exploratory Aim 3:   To evaluate the impact of lofexidine on illicit drug use in men and women with OUDs :  
Daily use data will be collected through morning reports via EMA and verified by [CONTACT_297826] (3 times 
weekly).  Hypothesis 1: Lofexidine will increase the number of consecutive days abstinent as compared to 
placebo.  Hypothesis 2: Lofexidine will be more efficacious in increasing consecutive days abstinent in women 
as compared to men.   Time to relapse will be calculated as the days between the start of study medication 
(following titration; day 14) and the first day of lapse to opi[INVESTIGATOR_351717] (day 40 ).  
Additionally,  daily use data will be examined to determine the maximum number of consecutive days abstinent 
during follow up.  Kaplan -Meier estimates and log-rank tests will be used to assess initial relationships between 
study treatment assignment and relapse while Cox proportional hazards models will be developed to assess the 
differential time to return to use across gender (using and appropriate interaction term).  A  significant interaction 
indicates that treatment  may impact return to use time differently in women and men.  Proportionality of hazards 
will be assessed using log- log plots and log- time interactions . 
V20 7.25.23  Power and Sample Size (complete sample size justification available in Biostatistics Resource Core ): 
The current study is powered on the primary Aims 1 and 2.  In the proposed study, response to a laboratory 
stressor, CREMA cue response and daily use data will be tested using GLMMs (assuming a Gaussian 
distribution) and the study will be powered to suffic iently address the least of the study treatment effect sizes 
determined to be clinically meaningful for the study hypothesis.  Aim 1:  Sinha and colleagues (Sinha, et al 2007), 
in a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_38264], demonstrated that lofex idine in combination with naltrexone attenuated craving and anger 
in response to laboratory drug and stress cues as compared to naltrexone alone.  Results indicate a larger 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_351718]- related and stress cues occurs in placebo participants than 
lofexidine treated participants [Drug related cue response Δ=2.2; SD P=2.6; between group Cohen’s  d=0.85, 
p<0.05 and stress cues response Δ=2.1; SD P=2.4; between group Cohen’s  d=0.88, p<0.05].  Moreover, Fox and 
colleagues (2014)   conducted a trial of guanfaci ne in cocaine- dependent individuals and noted stress and craving 
response to stress and drug- related imagery.  They noted significant gend er differences across treatment 
assignment for craving and stress response to drug- related imagery [Craving Δ=3.0; SD P=3.8; Treatment x Sex 
Intx Cohen’s  d=0.79, p<0.05; Negative Emotion Δ=3.0; SD P=2.9; Treatment x Sex Intx Cohen’s  d=1.0, p<0.05].  
Sample sizes in both the Sinha and Fox studies were somewhat small. Smaller but still clinically relevant effect 
sizes in an adequately powered study are anticipated.  Therefore, a 20% reduction in craving and stress 
response from the previous studies is anticipated  in the current design (Cohen’s  d=0.64 for the sex x treatment 
interaction on craving response). Aim 2 :  Kowalczyk and colleagues (2015), showed that daily life craving reports 
as measured by [CONTACT_351764][INVESTIGATOR_351719] [6.3% (95% CI=5.6 -7.1) vs. 11.8% (10.9 -13.0); between group Cohen’s d=1.6].  To assess 
the least of the differences anticipated in project 2, a sample size of 39 participants randomized to each female and males ac ross active lofexidine and placebo groups would provide 80% power with a type 1 error rate of 5% 
to detect the treatment x sex interaction in craving and stress response to laboratory drug based cues (total 
n=156; 78 per group). We anticipate 25% attrition between randomization and the end of the 5 -week active 
treatment period.  Thus, inflating the necessary sample size to 68 participants randomized per treatment group 
with a total of n= [ADDRESS_437303] will provide important information about a novel treatment strategy which may demonstrate preferential efficacy in the treatment of women  with OUD.    
 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
1. RISKS TO THE SUBJECTS  
a. Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics136 
Admission into the study is open to men and women and to all racial and ethnic groups, age 18 -60. individuals 
with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2537] ( 68 men and 68 women)  will be recruited primarily through local substance use 
treatment facilities . Inclusion/exclusion c riteria that apply to all participants  are listed below:  
 
V20 7.25.23  General Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion Criteria  
1. Able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual level sufficient to allow accurate completion 
of all assessment instruments.  
2. Meet DSM -5 criteria for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]  (within the past three months). While individuals may also meet

any history of CV disease AND absence of family history of CV death, they are eligible for enrollment. For 
females with a QTc of greater than >460, but less than 490 AND absence of any history of CV disease AND 
absence of family history of CV death, they are eligible for enrollment . 
8. Known allergy to lofexidine 
9. Unable to comply with study procedures or pose threat to study staff.  
 
b. Sources of Materials  
Research material obtained from individual participants  includes questionnaires and interviews with study 
personnel, ambulatory assessment data, and blood, saliva and urine samples. To ensure confidentiality, all 
participant  data will be letter/number coded, and only the investigators will have access to the master lists of 
codes.  The research material will be obtained specifically for research purposes.  Written research material 
obtained will be stored in the Addiction Sciences  Division  or at Shoreline Behavioral Health, in an office that is 
locked when not in use. Saliva samples will be stored and processed in the Medical University of South Carolina 
Research Nexus Laboratory . MUSC staff at Shoreline will collect saliva samples, freeze and store them on site,  
and then send to MUSC for processing.  
 
c. Potential Risks  
1. Risks due to lofexidine:  A Cochrane review provides a comprehensive overview of adverse events associated 
with lofexidine and other alpha -adrenergic agents (Gowing et al., 2009).  Adverse events associated with 
lofexidine are primarily related to its alpha- adrenergic agonist effects.  Hypotension has been reported (Yu et al., 
2008; Gowing et al., 2009; Khan et al., 1997), but generally this was mild and studies comparing lofexidine with 
other alpha- agonists found that hypotension was seen less frequentl y with lofexidine.  Rebound increase in blood 
pressure after lofexidine discontinuation has also been reported (Yu et al., 2008), but was not severe enough to 
require intervention.   Sedation, dizziness and dry mouth have also been reported with lofexidine at higher rates 
than placebo, but lower when compared to other alpha- agonists (Khan et al., 1997; Gowing et al., 2009 ). A case 
report (Schmitter et al., 2004) and a dose escalation study (Schmitter et al., 2009) report QTc interval 
prolongation in indivi duals with lofexidine added to methadone, but there have been no reports of QTc 
prolongation with lofexidine monotherapy.    
 
V20 7.25.23  2. Risks due to study procedures: Participants will be asked not to use illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_4976] 7 days, however all will 
be stabilized on buprenorphine or methadone so there should be no risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801].  
 
3. Potential risks of rating scales and questionnaires: These are all non- invasive, should add no risk, and have 
been used without difficulty or any adverse events in our previous studies. The only minor inconvenience could 
be the time taken to complete them. Some participants may feel uncomfortable disclosing personal thoughts and 
feelings.  
 
4. Risks of stress induction procedures: There is a small risk of increased stress or opi[INVESTIGATOR_351721] a result of 
the CREMA procedures; however, it will likely not differ substantially from the reactivity elicited by [CONTACT_351765] -to-day environment of study participants. Participants that report sustained 
significant stress or craving after the laboratory session will be provided a debriefing to address symptoms.  
 
5. Risks of loss of confidentiality: Careful efforts aimed at maintaining confidentiality have been effective in 
previous research, and only participants’ code numbers will be recorded on the forms themselves to protect 
confidentiality. Phones provided by [CONTACT_351766][INVESTIGATOR_499]; participants utilizing their own phones will be asked to password protect their device 
for the duration of the study.  
 
2. ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION AGAINSTS RISKS  
a. Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Potential study participants  will primarily be recruited through local treatment settings . Medical records will not  
be reviewed to identify potential study participant s.  The study PI, a Co- I, or other qualified study staff will obtain 
informed consent. The informed consent form includes a detailed description of the study procedures, along with 
statements regarding participants’ rights to withdraw from the procedure at  any time without consequences. The 
informed consent form will be explained to participant s in easy -to-understand language, and subjects will be 
instructed to read the form carefully prior to signing it.  Consent will be documented by [CONTACT_217181], accompanied by [CONTACT_253767].  
 
b. Protection s Against Risks  
All study participants will be closely monitored for psychiatric and medical stability. All sessions will be conducted 
under the supervision of experienced personnel. If crisis intervention is necessary, senior staff will be available 
to evaluate the subje ct and provide an intervention or referral. If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89648], the patient will be 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_351722]. 
All participants  will be fully informed that they may withdraw from the study  at any time without penalty.  
 
Lofexidine will be titrated over ten days when it is initiated.  P articipant s will be seen by a medical provider on 
three times a week uring dosage escalation and orthostatic hypotension testing will be done.  The medical 
provider will inform the participant, verbally and with a hand -out to take home, concerning common side effects 
of lofexidine (dizziness, somnolence , dry mouth) and precautions to minimize risks associated with blood 
pressure decreases (hydration, standing up slowly). The target dose of lofexidine is 2. 16 mg per day, but if 
hypotension or other troublesome side effects develop, the medical provider may slow the titration for that 
individual.   At the end of the study, medications will be tapered over a five- day period.  Participants will be seen 
every other day during medication taper and blood pressure will be monitored.   
 To ensure confidentiality, all participant data will be coded by [CONTACT_217183]/or numbers, and only the investigators 
will have access to the master lists of codes.  All participant  records will be kept in a locked cabinet in an office 
that will be locked at times when not in use.  Participants who screen remotely and have virtual medication 
monitoring visits will be instructed to find a private location to conduc these visits.  The research staff understands 
the importance of maintaining confidentiality, and t his method of maintaining confidentiality has been used for 
several years by [CONTACT_218520]. All electronic databases are stored on HIPAA -
compliant servers with restricted access. All co -investigators and study personnel have completed (or will 
complete upon hiring) training in Good Clinical Practices as mandated by [CONTACT_351767].  
  
V20 7.25.23  Participants will be taught about potential side effects of lofexidine , and will be closely followed by [CONTACT_140332], 
a PharmD, and other members of the research team. Pregnancy tests will be performed prior to lofexidine  
administration. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. A member of the research staff will be 
available to discuss management of any craving urges if craving remains elevated at the end of any study 
procedures . 
 
3. DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN 
 This section is based on the recommendations in NIDA’s “Guidelines for Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan” ( www.drugabuse.gov/funding/dsmbsop.html ). A detailed DSMP will be developed and 
approved by [CONTACT_313173].  
 
1. Summary of the Protocol .   
This application proposes to investigate the effects of lofexidine on stress -induced craving and relapse.  The 
primary outcome of interest is stress reactivity. Inclusion/exclusion criteria are outlined above.  Power 
calculations and sample sizes are in the Data Analysis Plan section above.  
 
2. Trial Management .   
The study will be managed from the Addiction Sciences Division within the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Medical University of South Carolina.  The target population is described above in 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 
3. Data Management and Analysis . 
Data will be entered by [CONTACT_351768] a computer using standard database software using REDCap.  The data analysis plan is outlined in the Data Analysis Plan section.  
 
4. Quality Assurance.  
Quarterly data audits will be conducted.  Confidentiality protections are outlined above.  
 
5. Regulatory Issues.  
Potential conflicts of interest will be reported using the upcoming NIH rules for disclosure.  Adverse Events 
(AEs)/Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) occurring during the course of the project will be collected, documented, 
and reported in accordance with protocol and IRB reporting requirements.  All research staff involved with 
adverse event reporting will receive general and protocol specific AE/SAE training including identification, 
assessment and evaluation, and documentation and reporting.  A research assi stant will identify any potential 
adverse events during the course of the study from participant self -report and administration of the visit 
assessments and procedures. The research assistant will provide information to a study physician, who will be responsible for AE/SAE assessment and evaluation including a determination of seriousness and study 
relatedness. Any significant actions taken by [CONTACT_351769]/NIDA.   
 
6. Definition of AE and SAE.  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment (ICH GCP).  Any 
unwanted change, physically, psychological ly or behaviorally, that occurs in a study participant during the course 
of the trial is an adverse event.  A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that has one of 
the following outcomes:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening,  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect OR  
• Requires  intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.  
 
7. Documentation and Reporting.  
V20 7.25.23  AEs/SAEs are documented and reported as per protocol and IRB requirements.  Research staff will identify 
adverse events and obtain all available information to assess severity, seriousness, study relatedness, 
expectedness, outcome and the need for change or discontinuation in the study intervention.  Adverse events 
are generally documented on AE Logs and AE C ase Report Forms (CRFs).  Additional relevant AE information 
if available should be documented in a progress note in the research record as appropriate to allow monitoring and evaluating of the AE.  If the AE meets the definition for serious, appropriate S AE protocol specific reporting 
forms are completed and disseminated to the appropriate persons and within the designated timeframes as 
indicated above.  For each AE/SAE recorded, the research staff will follow the AE/SAE until resolution, 
stabilization or until the participant is no longer in the study as stated in the protocol. When a reportable SAE is 
identified, t he research staff will notify the MUSC Institutional Review Board (IRB) within [ADDRESS_437305].  
 
If complete information is not available when the initial 24- hour SAE report is disseminated, follow -up information 
will be gathered to enable a complete assessment and outcome of the event.  This information may include 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139257], autopsy  reports, clinic records, etc.  The research staff will attach copi[INVESTIGATOR_351723] 2 weeks of the initial SAE report.  In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_17027] l provide a signed, dated SAE summary report, 
which will be sent to the ORWH/NIDA Medical Safety Officer within two weeks of the initial SAE report.  
 
We will report adverse events to the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Institutional Review Board (IRB) online as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_437306] learns of the event.  The MUSC IRB AE reporting requirements are as follows:  All deaths that occur during the study or [ADDRESS_437307] at the next 
meeting.  
8. Trial Safety . 
The potential risks and benefits and methods to minimize these risks are outlined above. The research staff will 
report any unexpected AEs or any scores of “severe” on the side- effect symptom rating form or any FDA -defined 
serious AEs to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hrs so that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_313117].  All unexpected AEs will be monitored while they are active to determine if treatment is needed.  Study procedures will follow the FDA’s 
Good Clinical Practice Guidelines ( www.fda.gov/oc/gcp ). Any outside requests for information or any breaches 
in confidentiality will be reported to [CONTACT_335437] .  
 
9. Trial Efficacy.  
An interim analysis is not planned at this time; however, an analysis will be performed if requested by [CONTACT_351770]/ NIDA or the DSMB.  
 
10. DSM Plan Administration.  
Drs. Brady and Guille will be responsible for monitoring the study, and will participate in weekly study meetings. 
A DSM report will be filed with the IRB and ORWH/NIDA on a yearly basis, unless greater than expected 
problems occur.  The report will include participant characteristics, retention and disposition of study participants, 
quality assurance issues and reports of AEs, significant/unexpected AEs and serious AEs.  Outcomes will be 
reported at the end of the trial.  
 
11. DSM Board .   
A Data Safety and Monitoring Board will be formed to monitor both the rate and severity of adverse events.  This 
panel will include [ADDRESS_437308] will be registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol 
Registration System Information Website prior to study initiation.

A. PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND:  
 You are being asked to volunteer for a research study. The research is sponsored by [CONTACT_55954]. The purpose of this study is to determine if the medication lofexidine, taken together with buprenorphine  or 
methadone , is more effective at reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_252237], use and stress response than buprenorphine  or methadone  
alone, and to see if this effect is different for men and women. Lofexidine is FDA approved to treat opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351]. This study also involves a cue presentation app  known as “CREMA” (Cue Reactivity Ecologic Momentary 
Assessment) which delivers pi[INVESTIGATOR_351724] (more information 
below). You are being asked to participate in this study because you are between the ages of [ADDRESS_437310] opi[INVESTIGATOR_46212], and are currently prescribed buprenorphine  or methadone . The investigators in charge of this study are 
Kathleen Brady, M.D., Ph.D., and Connie Guille, M.D. The study is being conducted at the MUSC Addiction Sciences  
Division and Shoreline Behavioral Health and will involve 136 volunteers. 
 
B. PROCEDURES:  
Screening : If you agree to be in this study, you will first be evaluated and the results of the evaluation must meet Concise Summary  
You are being asked to volunteer for a research study. Research studies are voluntary and include 
only people who choose to take part.  The purpose of this study is to see if the medication 
lofexidine, taken together with buprenorphine  or methadone , is more effective at reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_224773], opi[INVESTIGATOR_45705] /or stress response compared to buprenorphine  or methadone  alone , We 
are also looking to see if these effects are different for men and women. Lofexidine is FDA approved to treat physical symptoms of opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351]. In this study, we are looking to see if 
it also reduces stress response, opi[INVESTIGATOR_351725] . 
 
Participants will complete a screening visit to determine study eligibility. During the first week, 
participants will be  asked to abstain from opi[INVESTIGATOR_351726] . 
Participants will come to the clinic  that week for urine drug testing. After  2 tests are negative, 
participants will be randomly assigned to take either lofexidine  or placebo (inactive medication) 
two to three times  a day  for about [ADDRESS_437311] their vital signs measured. They will also participate in “CREMA” sessions 
(Cue Reactivity Ecologic Momentary Assessment) .  Twice  a day  these sessions will ask about 
substance use, craving and stress.  An additional  session each day  will include looking at stressful 
or neutral  pi[INVESTIGATOR_351727].  At  the end of five weeks , participants will return 
to the clinic  on two consecutive days  to participate in a stress task  and an opi[INVESTIGATOR_351728]. For the  next  five days, participants will taper their medication dose. During this time they 
will continue to come to clinic to have their vital signs measured and complete a follow -up visit.  
 
There may be no direct benefit to you for participating in this study.  Study medication risks are 
detailed below; the most common side effect s are low blood pressure, tiredness, dizziness and dry 
mouth.

teaspoons) to assess your genera l health. You will also be asked to provide a urine sample to test for drugs of abuse. 
If you are female and of child-bearing potential, you will have a pregnancy test prior to urine drug screening. If you 
are pregnant, you will not be allowed to participa te. You will be asked to fill out several forms dealing with how often 
and why you use opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], your mood symptoms, pain , stressful events , and the impact Covid-19 has had in your life .  
Remote screening : The initial visit may also be done remotely. In that case, the consent will be emailed to you prior to 
the screening appointment. You will be asked to find a private location to have a video call with study staff. On the 
call, study staff will obtain informed consent and do the initial interview. You will also speak with study medical staff to review your medical history.  If you are eligible, you will be sent survey links to complete questionnaires. You will 
have an EKG and blood draw at your baseline vi sit. If you complete screening remotely, you will not provide urine 
for pregnancy and/or drug screening until the baseline visit. You may be asked to meet with medical staff for a physical 
exam if they think it is necessary based on your history. If you meet all entrance requirements, you will be trained on 
how to use CREMA on an iPhone .  If necessary, y ou will be scheduled to return to complete  urine samples  over the 
next week. Two consecutive urine samples must be negative for opi[INVESTIGATOR_351729].  
 
CREMA: Cue Reactivity Ecologic Momentary Assessment (CREMA) is an app that allows you to complete study 
procedures without having to come in to the lab and provides information about your response to different types of 
cues in a real -world setting. You will complete t hree CREMA sessions a day during the study . In one session that will 
occur at the same time each day , you will be asked about substance use and stress over the previous 24 hours. One 
session will occur randomly and you will be asked about your current stress, craving and mood. During one session 
you will be shown either neutral pi[INVESTIGATOR_351730], craving, and mood.    
 
Medication phase : After completing the baseline week assessments and testing negative for opi [INVESTIGATOR_2438] (other than 
buprenorphine  or methadone ) at two visits, you will receive study medication, either lofexidine  or placebo (a capsule 
that does not contain any active medication). Neither you nor the study staff will know which medication you are 
taking as both lofexidine and placebo will be given as capsules identical in appearance. You will be randomly assigned 
to receive either lofexidine or placebo. This means that you have a 50/50 chance (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) of being in either 
group. Neither the researchers nor you will make the choice regarding your group assignment . The medication will be 
started at a low d ose and increased according to the following schedule:  0.[ADDRESS_437313] two evenings , 0.36 mg in 
the morning and evening on days 3 and 4; 0.36 mg in the morning, afternoon, and at bedtime on days 5 and 6; 0.36

Remote monitoring: If it is necessary to limit clinic visits, medication monitoring may be done remotely.  For remote monitoring, you will have one clinic visit a week and two virtual visits. At your first medication visit, you will receive a blood pressure cuff that fits on your wrist and you will be trained on how to measure orthostatic blood 
pressure. This process involves lying down for 3-[ADDRESS_437317] video calls with staff twice a week 
to complete these procedures. Once you are on a stable dose, you will only need to do regular blood pressure checks on these calls. You will also be provided with saliva drug screens that can be done at home, and you will do these on 
the video calls as well.  The saliva drug screen involves collecting saliva with a swab kit that will be provided to you.  
Stress task : After five weeks of study medication, you will return to the clinic  on two consecutive days  to complete  a 
stress task  and an opi[INVESTIGATOR_351731]. You will be asked to arrive at 8:00 am  each day  and to avoid caffeinated 
beverages. If you smoke cigarettes, you may be provided with a nicotine patch. Your urine will be tested for drugs of 
abuse. If you are female, you will provide a saliva sample so we can measure your hormone levels, and your urine  
will be tested for pregnancy prior to your drug s creen . Approximately thirty minutes after you arrive, a blood 
pressure cuff will be placed on your arm. Throughout the procedures, you will provide saliva samples for hormone 
measurement, rate your mood and level of opi[INVESTIGATOR_252237], and your heart rate and blood pressure will be measured.  
Stress task: You will complete a progressive relaxation task, and then you will be asked to deliver a speech and 
perform a math problem out loud in front of a group of strangers.   
 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_351732]: You will complete a progressive relaxation task, and then you will listen to a recording based 
on your interview about craving opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
You will be randomly assigned to complete either the stress or opi[INVESTIGATOR_351733].  
Medication taper and follow-up: After th e second visit, you will reduce your study medication dose over the next 
week. You will be asked to come into the clinic after each dose reduction to have your blood pressure and pulse 
measured. This will total two visits. After your final dose reduction, you will come to the clinic to provide a urine 
drug screen, have vital signs collected, and complete surveys about the study and a questionnaire about pain.  
Participation in this study is totally  voluntary, and you may choose not to participate. You may also withdraw your 
consent and discontinue participation at any time. Discontinuation will in no way jeopardize your ability to receive 
treatment at this Institution now or in the future. You may be  withdrawn from the study without your consent if the 
researchers believe it is in your best interest.  
 
C. DURATION:  
Participation in this study involves  up to 23  visits over a period of approximately two months. The initial screening 
visit will take about 3 hours and the CREMA training visit will take about 30 minutes.  The weekly visits, medication tapering visits and follow -up visits will take approximately 30 mi nutes.

20 minutes a day completing the CREMA sessions at home.  
 
D. RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:  
Participation in this study may involve risks.  
 
Medication:  Side effects that were reported by [CONTACT_726] 10% of patients treated with lofexidine, and more often than 
placebo, include trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], low blood pressure when standing up, slow heart rate, low blood pressure, dizziness, 
drowsiness, sedation and dry mouth.  Rebound high blood pressure has also been observed when people abruptly stop taking lofexidine, however your dose will be tapered off gradually to prevent this increase, and your blood pressure 
and pulse will be monitored regularly throughout the study.  
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_9757] : You will be asked to abstain from opi[INVESTIGATOR_351735] 7 days, 
however you should not experience withdrawal symptoms since you are already stabilized on 
buprenorphine /methadone . 
 Treatment assignment : You will be assigned to treatment by [CONTACT_3364]. The treatment you receive may prove to be less 
effective or to have more side effects than the other study treatment or other available treatment. You may be in the 
group that receives placebo and does not recei ve active medication.  
 
Stress task : Participation in the speech and math task may cause some anxiety and feelings of stress. Some of the 
CREMA sessions may also cause anxiety, but should be no more stressful than events encountered in everyday life.  
 Scripted opi[INVESTIGATOR_351710]: The interview and scripted imagery task may produce some craving for opi[INVESTIGATOR_351736]. However, this discomfort is usually brief and you will be in the safety of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-free laboratory 
environment. A member of the research team will be available to discuss your cravings with you prior to leaving the 
research facility.  
 Blood draw: The risks of drawing blood include temporary discomfort from the needle stick, bruising, and infection. 
Fainting could occur.  
 Interviews : The interviews and questionnaires that you will receive during the course of the study involve no specific 
risks or discomforts beyond those of a standard clinical interview situation, such as feeling upset at the review of your 
psychiatric status, boredom, or fatigue. If a question makes you feel uncomfortable you may refuse to answer it.  
 
Urine drug screening: If you are a female of childbearing potential, you will receive a pregnancy test, and if pregnant, 
you will not be allowed to participate in the study. If you are capable of becoming pregnant, you must be using a 
medically approved method of birth control (such as contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], diaphragms, or other forms of barrier 
contraceptives) and you must continue to do so during the  course of the study. Should you become pregnant during 
the study you must immediately contact [CONTACT_351771].  
 
Your urine will be screened for the presence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_351737]. These results will 
not be part of your medical record but will be kept in research records maintained by [CONTACT_093]. Every effort will 
be made to protect the confidential nature of this information. However, there may be circumstances under which the 
investigator may release this information. If you are pregnant or become pregnant and test positive for illegal drugs, the SC Department of Social Servi ces (DSS) may be notified. You could be at risk of going to jail or losing custody 
of your children.

Unknown Risks : The experimental treatments may have unknown side effects. The researchers will let you know if 
they learn anything that might make you change your mind about participating in the study.  
 
Confidentiality : There is a risk of a loss of confidentiality as a result of participation in this study. Information about 
you, as well as your image will be kept in password-protected databases and computers and will only be accessible by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_1238] t he research staff. Video clips will only be viewed by [CONTACT_351772].

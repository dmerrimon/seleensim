 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
There are numerous transdermal  drug delivery systems (TDDS) that are currently available in 
the [LOCATION_002], the first of which was approved by [CONTACT_2165] 
(FDA) in 1979 [1]. Transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) available in the form of 
patches  are convenient, attract ive, and easy to use systems. Fentanyl is a very popular TDDS 
available on the [LOCATION_002] market today. Drug release from these TDDS varies 
significantly and is dependent on a number of factors including system design, 
physicochemical properties of the drug, excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], occlusion, sweat, skin condition, skin type 
and temperature. Investigating the influence of these factors on drug release from reference 
and generic products that are often available in different forms is important to ensure that 
generic products are not less safe than the reference product.  Accurate determination of the 
rate and extent of drug release and absorption is crucial to ensure the safety of individuals 
using this and other types of TDDS.  
 
Positive outcome of this project will i dentify appropriate methods to determine the rate and 
extent of drug release and absorption from TDDS, and will help regulatory agencies in the 
development of Guidances for Industry regarding the characterization of drug release and 
absorption kinetics to ensure the safety of individuals utilizing these types of products.  
2.2 Rationale  
The rationale of this study is to determine the delivery rate and the extent of absorption of 
fentanyl drug release from FDA -approved TDDS products (reference e.g. Duragesic ®, versus 
Mylan transdermal patches) that have different inactive ingredients. can be determined in 
humans by [CONTACT_332548] -wear, and the delivery rate 
can be determined in pharmacokinetic studies.  This study will comp are fentanyl levels by 
[CONTACT_332549], as a predictor of in -vivo bioequivalence  and 
pharmacokinetics of Duragesic® and Mylan fentanyl TDDS . This will be done  through 
development of an appropriately controll ed and well -character ized in-vitro methodology to 
quantify the in-vivo exposure of healthy adults to fentanyl during TDDS wear, so that the rate 
of drug delivery can be defined in a manner that can help the regulatory agency (FDA) in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_332541].  
In the clinical study component, we will employ two types of evaluation to determine the rate 
and extent of drug release and  absorption from fentanyl TDDS, namely residual drug analysis 
post-wear and pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy adult Subject s. In addition, we will 
compare the serum drug concentrations following TDDS and intravenous administration, in

 3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Study Objectives  
The objectives of this open label, randomized, crossover study are to  
 To explore bioequivalence  of Duragesic® transdermal system and generic Mylan fentanyl 
TDDS, and compare bioavailability to direct IV infusion of fentanyl citrate.  
 To conduct release rate analysis  of generic fentanyl (Mylan) TDDS compared to Duragesic® 
TDDS.  
 To determine the residual drug content of the Duragesic® and generic fentanyl TDDS.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_411226] s (i.e., clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V), elimination 
rate constant (Kel), maximum serum concentration (Cmax); time of maximum serum 
concentration (Tmax) of fentanyl and area under the serum concentration -time curve (AUC).  In 
addition, we will de termine residual drug content from worn Duragesic® and Mylan fentanyl 
TDDS to estimate total amount of absorbed fentanyl from each.

 4   STUDY DESIGN  
This is a  three treatment  open -label, randomized cross-over clinical study with a Run -In Study Session  I 
of intravenous fentanyl citrate , followed by [CONTACT_332550]® and generic fentanyl in a 
sequen tial, 2-Session  fashion with at least a one week wash -out Session  between the sessions .  
 
The study design is shown below:  
 
Study Session  I 
(Run -in) Randomization   Study Session  II Study Session  III 
Intravenous -Fentanyl  Study Arm 1  Duragesic®  Mylan Fentanyl  
Study Arm 2  Mylan Fentanyl  Duragesic®  
 
 
The study will consist of a total of twenty -five Study Days ([ADDRESS_411227] s) within three Study Session s, 
with at least a one week washout Session  between successive  Study Session s. The half -life of fentanyl is 
approximately 24 hours. Hence, 5 days (i.e. 5 half-lives) will be sufficient for >95% of fentanyl to be 
eliminated from the body. Each of the 2 4 Subjects will be enrolled to complete all twenty -five study days 
(Run-In Study Session  I = 5 Study Days ; Study Session s II and III = 10 Study Days each) . The study is 
open label and not blinded, because PK assessment is not subject to participant and/or observer bias. After 
each Study Session  is completed, the available safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_332551] (ISM) to determine wheth er or not to proceed to the next Study Session . 
Considering the objective of the study to explore bioequivalence  of Duragesic® and generic fentanyl and 
to conduct release rate analysis  of generic fentanyl to Duragesic®, the above study design would 
adequat ely address both questions.  The randomization to sequences [Reference (R) –Test (T), T -R] 
would appropriately take into account the sequence and the Session  effect for bioequivalence evaluations. 
Having all Subject s enter the intravenous Run -In Study Session I initially would also help in accurate 
determination of absolute bioavailability for Duragesic® and generic Mylan fentanyl in this study.    
Each Subject  will be his/her own control and each Subject  will sign an institutional review board –
approved cons ent form explaining the purpose, nature, risks, benefits, and duration of the study. The 
study will be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines and with the ethical 
principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
 
The three Study Session s are as follows:

 Area under the time curve from dosing time to last measurement time (AUC 0-t) and peak drug 
activity (C max) for Duragesic® TDDS and Mylan fentanyl TDDS will be used as the primary 
endpoint.  For intravenous fentanyl, AUC 0-∞ will be determined.  
 The time to maximu m concentrations (T max) and AUC 0-∞ for fentanyl from Duragesic® TDDS 
and Mylan fentanyl TDDS will also be determined.   
8.[ADDRESS_411243] square mean 
estimates for the adjusted differences between treatment means (the log transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-C 
and C max) and the standard error associated with these differences will be obtained.  The geometric 
means for AUC 0-a will be obtained by [CONTACT_332561] 0-i for all the three 
treatments to determine the absolute bioavailability.       
The absolute bioavailability  for Duragesic® TDDS and Mylan fentanyl TDDS will be calculated .

 The analyses for IV administration of fentanyl citrate will be as follows:  
Non compartmental and compartmental analyses will be conducted to estimate the PK parameters 
such as clearance, volume of distribution, elimination rate constant, maximum serum concentration; 
time of maximum serum concentration and area under the serum concent ration -time curve. All 
analyses will be conducted using Phoenix® WinNonlin® 6.3 (Pharsight, a Certara Company, CA). 
Absolute bioavailability will be calculated .   
The analyses for both TDDS applications (Duragesic® and Mylan fentanyl) will be as follows:   
The serum fentanyl concentrations will be determined and the PK parameters such as C max, T max, 
AUC, steady concentrations (C ss) of fentanyl in each Subject will be elucidated. The rate of fentanyl 
absorption in each Subject is calculated by [CONTACT_332562] . 
Cumulative amount of fentanyl released by [CONTACT_332563]® at the end of study Session will be obtained 
by [CONTACT_332564].  
 
Similarly, cumulative amount of the drug released by [CONTACT_332565] . 
 
The rate of drug release from Duragesic® and Mylan TDDS will be determined .    
The means of fentanyl release rates from Duragesic® TDDS, standard deviations from their mean, and 
95% confidence intervals will be determined and tabulated. The statistical significance of difference 
between the means will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1192] -tailed Student’s t -test.

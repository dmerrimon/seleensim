# Section Comments 
1. Schema  
& 5.1 Part 1 – remove the sentence “Entinostat will be stored at the pharmacy and it will 
not be given for the patient to take home.”   
PI [INVESTIGATOR_28516]: The procedure is indeed to give the entinostat in the clinic and 
not to give to the patient to take home, so this sentence was not removed.

 SCHEMA 
Title of Study: A Phase 1b study of the anti-PD1 antibody Pembrolizumab in combination with the 
histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat for treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes after 
DNA methyltransferase inhibitor therapy failure 
Investigators: Principal investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_640215], MD, MHS 
Study Center(s): Yale Cancer Center 
Concept and Rationale: Besides allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), the DNA 
methyltransferase inhibitor (DMNTi) azacitidine (AZA) is the only treatment proven to prolong 
survival in patients with higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). Nonetheless, HR-MDS patients treated with AZA have a median survival advantage of 9.5 months (24.5 vs 15 months median 
OS)
1 and the objective response rate is only 50% with most pa tients eventually relapsing within [ADDRESS_856809] of care for those patients. Therefore, improving outcomes of MDS patients after failure of 
DNMTi remains a top clinical and research priority 
3. 
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) comprise a group of drugs that share the ability to inhibit the 
important epi[INVESTIGATOR_640216]. As single agents, several HDACi exhibited only modest 
clinical activities in MDS4,5. Therefore, the interest to develop these agents further has focused on 
combination-based strategies, usually with DNMTi. To date, no HDACi-DNMTi combination has 
improved survival of MDS p atients in ra ndomized studies when used in the frontline or the post- DNMTi 
failure setting. These observations suggest that while HDACi therapy has modest activity in MDS, 
DNMTi might not be the best choice for combination-based regimen with HDACi. Exploration of 
alternative agents to combine with HDACi in the post-DNMTi failure setting might be a more rational 
approach. Recent advances in tumor immunology have facilitated understanding the role of immune escape as important mechanism of cancer progression and treatment resistance. One important mechanism which cancers employ commonly to evade the immune system involve the exploitation of T-cell inhibitory pathways and molecules such as the programed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated 
antigen-4 (CTLA-4) 
[ADDRESS_856810] PD-1, itsligand 
(PD-L1), and CTLA-[ADDRESS_856811] that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which are 
significantly increased in bone marrows of MDS patients (~35% vs <5% in non-MDS bone marrow), 
play an important role in ineffective he matopoiesis in MDS14. MDSCs also induce resistance to immune 
checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1) in colon cancer bearing mice15. Importantly, in this 
mouse model MDSCs were significantly decreased by [CONTACT_640286][INVESTIGATOR_640217] 
(ENT), leading to rejection of tumors when combined with immune checkpoint blockade15. 
Primary Objective(s): To identify the maximum tolerated total dose (MTD) of entinostat given in 
combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475)  in post-HMA failure setting for patients with MDS. 
Secondary Objective(s): To obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of entinostat in combination 
with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). 
4 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/2020  
  
Primary Endpoint(s): MTD as defined by [CONTACT_517446]-limiting toxicity (DLT) among 2 
dose schedules 
Secondary Endpoint(s): Overall response rate (ORR), with a target if at least 15% to be continued 
for a phase 2 study. 
Exploratory Endpoint(s): 
x Median response duration for responders, median time of progression to AML, median overall 
survival (OS) and 1- and 2-year OS rates. 
x Assessment of the dynamic quantitative change in proportion of MDSCs and PD-1 expression 
in BM with combined therapy and correlation with any observed clinical responses. 
Study Design: This will be a phase 1b study [see schema]. The proposed dosing of ENT has been

Version Date: 09/04/2020  
  
previously tested in MDS as single agent and shown to be well-tolerated. While the combination of 
ENT with the anti-PD1, pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has not been studied clinically in MDS patients, 
based on mechanisms of action it is unlikely that this combination would have overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685]. 
PART 1: ENT has been previously evaluated as a single agent therapy in patients with MDS at these 
doses and has been well tolerated. The ENT monotherapy run-in part (cycle 1) will allow to study the 
changes in MDSCs at pre- and post- ENT treatment (the end of cycle 1) to dissect the effects of ENT 
monotherapy from those of the combined ENT/anti-PD1 therapy. 
We will perform ‘3+3’ classical dose escalation design to determine DLT. The first 3 patients will 
receive ENT at dose level 1 (DL1: 8mg on D1, 8 of 21-day cycles). pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 
will be added starting day 1 cycle 2 at the approved dose (200mg intravenously [IV] over 30 
minutes on D1 of 21-day cycles) for [ADDRESS_856812] 3 treated patients in 
that dose level if there are toxicity/safety concerns that did not qualify as DLT (maximum of 6 
evaluable patients to be enrolled at any dose level). The committee can also decide to enroll patients at a lower dose level after the first [ADDRESS_856813] 6 patients enrolled in any dose level 
even if no or one DLT occurred at that dose level if there are toxicity/safety concerns that did not 
qualify as DLT. The following regarding enrollment in different dose levels will be considered 
guidance for the safety committee but can be modified in accordance of above: If no patient of the 
3 patients treated with combined therapy at DL1 develops DLT, then dose level 2 (DL2) will be tested. DL2 will be with ENT at 8mg on D1, 8 and 15 and pembrolizumab (MK-3475) at 200mg 
IV on D1 of 21-day cycles. If 1 patient out of the 3 patients has DLT at DL1, we will expand 
cohort to 3 more patients and if 1 patient of the 6 patients has DLT (i.e. only 0/3 or 1/6), we will 
test next dose (DL2). If no patient of the 3 patients treated with combined therapy at DL2 develop 
DLT, then DL2 will be used for part 2 (expansion cohort). If 1 patient out of the 3 patients has DLT at DL2, we will expand cohort to 3 more patients and if 1 patient of the 6 patients has DLT 
(i.e. only 0/3 or 1/6), dose level 2 (DL2) will be used for part 2 (expansion cohort). If 2 patients or 
more of the 6 patients at DL2 experience DLT, DL1 will be used for expansion cohort. The cycle 
duration will be 21 days, the maximum number of treatment cycles of entinostat will be 18 cycles 
and for pembrolizumab (MK-3475) the maximum number of cycles will be 17. Cycle [ADDRESS_856814] concurrent administration. In all the phases of the study, entinostat will be 
administered in clinic within 2 hours before administration of pembrolizumab (MK-3475). 
Entinostat will be stored at the pharmacy and it will not be given for the patient to take home. 
 
An additional dose level (DL -1) in which day 8 of ENT will be omitted (i.e. ENT at 8mg on D1, and pembrolizumab (MK-3475) at 200mg IV on D1 of 21-day cycles) will be used if [ADDRESS_856815] 2 cycles of combined therapy at DL1. If 0 or 1 patients of the 6 patients 
treated with combined therapy at DL-1 develop DLT then DL-1 will be used in the second part of the 
study. If 2 or more 6 patients enrolled in DL -1 develop DLT, then the study will be terminated. If the 
AE drug causality is clear (e.g. immune related event) and one of the drugs is discontinued, the patient can remain on the study and receive the non-causative agent. 
Toxicities will be tabulated and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events Version 5 (CTCAE-5). DLT will be assessed after the first 2 cycles of combined therapy. 
Responses will be as defined by [CONTACT_55578] (IWG)-2006 criteria (CR, PR, or HI) and 
6 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/[ADDRESS_856816] 2 cycles, and every 2 cycles afterwards. Patients who achieve an 
objective response or maintain a stable disease (SD) status after the first 4 combination cycles will 
continue receiving both drugs at the same schedule t ill progression or up to 1 year of combined therapy. 
 
PART 2: After the safe dose of the combination is established, 15 patients will be treated with ENT+ 
pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combination at that same dose and schedule. Participants who go off-study 
during the 1st cycle of entinostat will be replaced in the escalation phase. Participants who do not 
complete the first 2 cycles of combined therapy without experiencing a DLT (as DLT period is defined 
in the first 2 combined therapy cycles) during dose escalation will also be replaced. To be DLT- 
evaluable, the patient must complete the first two cycles of combined therapy without experiencing a 
DLT. Any patient who is dose reduced during the entinostat run-in first cycle due to entinostat-related 
toxicity will be analyzed on the dose level that corresponds to the reduced dose level delivered during the first cycle of combined therapy. 
Assessment of response will occur after 4 combination cycles and similar to part 1, those who achieve 
an objective res ponse or SD w ill continue to receive the therapy till progression. Patients who progress 
or respond and subsequently lose response will be withdrawn from study. BM biopsy/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640218], after first cycle of ENT monotherapy, every 2 cycles of combined therapy, and at time of progression or study discontinuation. Formal safety assessment will be 
performed at end of DLT-observing period (i.e. 1 ENT monotherapy cycle and 2 cycles of combined 
therapy) for each patient) for each DL to assess for any unexpected autoimmune or other toxicity. The 
cycle duration will be 21 days, the maximum number of treatment cycles of entinostat will be 18 cycles 
and for pembrolizumab (MK-3475) the maximum number of cycles will be 17. Cycle [ADDRESS_856817] concurrent administration. 
The following early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_640219] w ill be used: We will cease 
enrollment in the expansion phase at the dose determined from dose escalation part of the study if we 
observe two or more DLTs among the first six evaluable patients enrolled in the expansion cohort. An 
evaluable patient is any patient who received a study drug. If the true toxicity rate is 50% or greater at the MTD then this rule will stop the trial with probability at least .89. S imilarly, if the true toxicity rate 
is 33% at the MTD then this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_640220] .65. In that event, a new 
expansion cohort w ill start at the dose level immediately below the dose level that was expanded. If the 
dose level bein
g expanded is dose level -1, then the stud y will be terminated.

Version Date: 09/04/2020  
  
 
Intervention and Mode of Delivery: Entinostat, PO administration, pembrolizumab (MK-3475), IV 
infusion 
Duration of Intervention and Evaluation: 1 year or until disease is progressed 
 
Statistical Methods: 
(a) Definition of primary outcome/endpoint: The primary endpoint is the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD), which is the highest dose level where 1 or fewer of 6 participants experience a dose 
limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first two cycles of treatment. The RP2D is the same as the 
MTD. The maximally administered dose is the dose at which two or more of 6 participants experience a DLT. 
 
Definition of DLT: DLT will be defined as the occurrence of any of the following during the 
first 2 cycles of combined therapy unless the event can clearly be determined to be unrelated to 
the study drugs. 
 
x Any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity with the following exceptions: A) Transient 
laboratory abnormalities that can be treated or resolve to grade 2 or less within 72 hours. 
x Grade 4 hematologic toxicity, including treatment-associated aplasia lasting >[ADDRESS_856824] dose of study drug. Given that severe anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are features of advanced MDS and commonly encountered in this patient population, they will not be used to define DLT except if associated with prolonged treatment-associated aplasia as 
described above. 
x Patients with grade 3 immune related adverse events will be removed from the treatment and 
this will be considered to be a DLT as well as any other immune-related adverse event that results in pembrolizumab interruption, dose modification, or discontinuation of therapy. 
x
x Definition of secondary outcomes/endpoints: Overall response rate (ORR: The sum of rates of 
complete response [CR], partial response [PR], and hematologic improvement [HI]) as defined 
by [CONTACT_27710]-2006 criteria (Appendix A) with a goal of at least 20% to be considered 
clinically meaningful for further evaluation in larger studies. 
x Analytic plan for primary objective: Toxicities will be tabulated and graded according to the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5 (CTCAE-5). DLT w ill be 
assessed after the first 2 cycles of combined therapy. 
x Analytic plan for secondary objectives/ Sample size justification: Currently there is no therapy 
that has been shown to prolong survival in MDS in the post-DNMTi s etting and that the 
expected best response in patients receiving supportive care only in post- DNMTi setting is 
QHJOLJLEOHRUOHVV,WLVJHQHUDOO\DFFHSWHGWKDWD2 55LQWKHSRVW -DNMTi is 
clinically meaningful and would be worth further evaluation in larger studies. We therefore 
calculated that treating a total of 21 patients in the combination arm ([ADDRESS_856825] part of the 
study and 15 in the second part of the study) to test the difference of ORR between 1% (null hypothesis-supportive care only) and 15% (alternative hypothesis, combination therapy). The 
null hypothesis response rate of 1% will be rejected if we observe [ADDRESS_856826]. The criterion has power between .84 and .93 for testing an alternative response rate of 15%. 
The total number of patients enrolled in the study will range from 6 to 27. 
x Analytic plan for exploratory objectives: The quantitative change in MDSCs (% MDSCs by 
11 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/2020  
  
 flow cytometry, QIF score by [CONTACT_485200]) during treatment with the ENT/anti-PD1 combined 
therapy will be estimated using mixed effects models to take into account the within-patient 
correlation. Likelihood ratio tests will be performed to confirm if random intercepts and slopes 
are necessary in the model. The fixed effect for change in MDSCs over time will be evaluated 
for significance. The variability in the rate of change in MDSCs across patients will also be examined. The association between the clinical outcome and a meaningful reduction in MDSCs, 
which will be defined after a review of the data, will be assessed with the chi- square test. The 
quantity of MDSCs at baseline and during treatment as continuous variables can also be 
compared between responding and non-responding patients using a t-test or Mann- Whitney U- 
Test, if more appropriate.

 1. OBJECTIVES 
 
1.1 Primary Objectives 
 
To assess safety, tolerability, and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
entinostat given in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives 
 
To obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of entinostat in combination with 
pembrolizumab (MK-3475). 
 
1.3 Exploratory objectives 
 
To assess the dynamic quantitative change in measurable immunological biomarkers (proportions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs], and programmed death 
protein-1 [PD-1] expression in bone marrow) with the combined epi[INVESTIGATOR_18193]- 
immunotherapy and correlation with any observed clinical responses. 
 
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
 
Novel treatment options after azacitidine failure represent a major unmet clinical need in MDS 
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are among the most common hematologic malignancies and 
constitute the most common chronic myeloid malignancy in [LOCATION_003]
16,17. The age-adjusted incidence 
in [LOCATION_003] has been estimated at 3.3-4.6 per 100,000 persons (ex ceeding that of acute myeloid 
leukemia [AML]) which translates into more 20,[ADDRESS_856830] higher- 
risk (HR)-disease, typi[INVESTIGATOR_640221] (I PSS) of 
intermediate-2 or high risk groups [Appendix B] , and have an expected median survival of less 
than one year if treated only with supportive measures20. The only curative treatment modality for 
HR-MDS is allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( allo-SCT), but due to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_640222], less than 5% of patients undergo 
allo-SCT21. Aside of allo-SCT, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) azacitidine is the 
only treatment proven to prolong survival in HR-MDS1. Nonetheless, the survival advantage with 
azacitidine has a median duration of only 9.5 months (24.5 vs 15 months in median overall survival 
[OS])1. Additionally, only 50% of patients receiving azacitidine exhibit an objective response 
(complete response rate [CR] only 17%) with most patients eventually relapsing within [ADDRESS_856831] improved 
16 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/[ADDRESS_856832] a graft source. As the mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to DNMTi therapy are poorly 
understood, it has been difficult to rationally design targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_640223]. 
 
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) demonstrated modest activity in MDS 
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) comprise a group of drugs that share the ability to inhibit 
the important epi[INVESTIGATOR_640224] (HDAC) but vary significantly in 
terms of their structure, target specificity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. There are [ADDRESS_856833]-HMA failure setting, usually by [CONTACT_640288] (in case of primary resistance) or re-acquiring (in 
case of secondary resistance) a clinical response. 
 
One of the HDACs studied in MDS in entinostat: an orally bioavailable, isotype-selective class 1- 
specific HDACi with long half-life (100 hours). A phase I clinical trial published in abstract form at Johns Hopkins University combined entinostat with a lower dose, prolonged administration 
schedules of azacitidine
22. In this trial, patients were treated with SQ azacitidine for 10 days at 
different dose levels (30, 40, or 50mg/m2/day) and given oral entinostat (2, 4, 6, 8 mg/m2/dose) on 
days 3 and 10. Out of 31 enrolled patients, 13 had MDS, 4 had c hronic myelomonocytic leukemia 
(CMML), and 14 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients were evaluable for response if they 
received 4 or more cycles of treatment. Of the 27 evaluable patients, 12 had responses (2 CR, 4 had partial responses [PR], and 6 bilineage hematologic improvement [HI]) according to the 
International Working Group [IWG] 2000 criteria. The 50mg/m
2/day dose of azacitidine D1-10 
and the entinostat 4 mg/m2/dose on D3 and D10 were subsequently studied in the randomized 
phase 2 ECOG1905 study versus azacitidine monotherapy at the same 50mg/m2/day dose D1- 
D1023. Both arms achieved rates of trilineage hematologic normalization (32% for azacitidine 
monotherapy and 27% for combination) that were exceeded that of the historical control in which the standard regimen of azacitidine at 75mg/m2/day D1-7 was used (16% in CALBG9221 trial). While there was no survival advantage with the combination compared to azacitidine, this could be potentially related to pharmacologic anta gonism caused by [CONTACT_640289], a 
potent cell-cycle inhibitor with a long half-life of 4.5 days, in each cycle (day 3) which could have 
inhibited incorporation of azacitidine into DNA and subsequent cell cycling
23. These findings 
suggest that wh ile entinostat has a modest activity in MDS, HMAs might not be the best choice 
17 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/[ADDRESS_856834]-DNMTi failure setting might be a more rational approach . 
 
Rationale for use of immune-check point inhibitors in MDS after DNMTi failure Programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) is a molecule expressed on antigen-stimulated T-cells and induces downstream signaling that cause inhibition of T-cell proliferation, cytokine release, and 
cytotoxicity
24. Recent data showed that multiple types of tumor are capable of evading the immune 
system by [CONTACT_640290]-1 ligands (e.g. PD-L1) which engages the PD-1 receptor on the surface 
of cytotoxic T-cell leading to suppression of their activity6. Immune checkpoint blockade with 
anti-PD-1 and anti-PDL-1 antibodies (and anti-cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 
[CTLA-4] antibodies) has emerged as a novel promising approach to reverse this phenomenon and 
has resulted in a significant and durable clinical activity in some patients with advanced solid 
malignancies especially metastatic melanoma9. Pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) is a 
humanized monoclonal IgG4-kappa antibody that inhibits PD-1 with highly selectivity which has recently been granted an accelerated approval in 2014 by [CONTACT_640291] (Keyt ruda product information. 
http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/ keytruda/keytrudapi. pdf .). In a large open- 
label, multicenter phase 1b trial, 173 adult patients with refractory metastatic melanoma were 
randomized to IV pembrolizumab at 2 or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks9. With a median follow-up of 8 
months, the ORR was 21-26% at both doses. Survival data has not yet been reported. Most common drug-related adverse events of any grade in the 2 and 10 mg/kg doses were fatigue (33% 
vs 37%), pruritus (26% vs 19%), and rash (18% vs 18%). Grade 3 fatigue (in 3%) was the only 
drug-related grade 3 to 4 adverse event reported in more than one patient
9, suggesting that the drug 
is well tolerated and is potentially associated with less severe side effects than the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Advanced non-small cell lung cancer showed 19.4% of ORR and 12.5 
months of median duration of response
25. Metastatic or refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck showed 18% of ORR to pembro lizumab in a phase Ib trial26. Pembrolizumab is now 
approved for advanced melanoma, non-s mall cell l ung cancer, and advanced head and neck cancer. 
 
Several lines of evidence suggest that the immune system dysregulation is important in the 
pathogenesis and progression of MDS and that targeting key immune effector and regulatory steps 
can be a novel therapeutic approach for disease control in MDS27. We are in fact evaluating the 
use of the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a multi-center CTEP-s ponsored phase 1 study in 
DNMTi-refractory MDS and there are other active phase 1 studies of anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 
antibodies in MDS. 
 
Data suggests that during disease progression in MDS the clonal blasts become more aggressive 
while the non-clonal immune cells become less efficient via unknown mechanisms12. In a Chinese 
study of 38 MDS patients, the percentages of CTLA-4, PD-1 and CD25 were significantly higher 
in patients with MDS compared to normal and the differences of CTLA-4, PD-1 and the ratio of CTLA-4/CD28 between patients with HR-MDS and lower-risk (LR)-MDS were more significant 
with progression of MDS further suggesting involvement of the PD-1 axis in MDS progression
28. 
Using MDS cell lines and patient samples, Kondo and colleagues12 showed that the expression of 
an immune-inhibitory molecule PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274) was induced by [CONTACT_14234]- ܵ( IFN-ܵ and 
tumor necrosis factor- Į71) -ĮRQ0'6EODVWVDQGWKDWWKHVHEODVWVH[KLELWHGPRUHSRWHQW
intrinsic proliferative capacity than PD-L1-negative MDS blasts. Additionally, these PD-L1-

Version Date: 09/04/[ADDRESS_856835] an intrinsic proliferative 
advantage and induce T-cell suppression through interactions with PD-1 r eceptors leading 
potentially to disease progression and suggesting a role for therapeutic intervention12. The MD 
Anderson group studied mRNA in CD34+ cells from 124 patients with MDS, AML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and found that 34%, 15%, and 8% had aberrant up- regulation 
(စ2-fold) in PD-L1, PD-1 and CTLA4, respectively
13. PD-L1 protein expression was observed in 
MDS CD34+ cells, whereas stromal and non-blast c ellular elements were positive for PD-1. More 
importantly, in subgroup of patients treated with DNMTi therapy, PD-L1, PD- 1 and CTLA4 
expression was increased with the patients who exhibited resistance to DNMTi therapy showing 
higher relative up-regulation in gene expression than responding patients. Furthermore, treatment of leukemia cells with decitabine resulted in a dose-dependent up- regulation of these genes and 
partial hypomethylation of PD-1 in leukemia cell lines and human samples
13. In addition to 
providing further evidence to the role of PD-1/PD-L1 axis in MDS progression, these results suggest this axis might mediate resistance to DNMTi therapy and provide rationale for combining 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_640225]-PD1 antibody as a novel 
therapeutic approach to improve outcomes of HR- MDS p atients. 
 
2.2 CTEP IND Agents 
 
 
2.2.1 Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 
 
MK-3475 (SCH 900475, pembrolizumab) is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) which binds the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor, thus inhibiting the interaction with its ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2 (Investigator’s Brochure, 
2014). PD-[ADDRESS_856836] may be a critical mechanism to evade T-cell mediated tumor 
rejection30,31. High levels of PD-L1 expression are correlated with poor prognosis and 
survival in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)32, pancreatic carcinoma33, hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC)34, and ovarian carcinoma35. 
 
Immune-checkpoint inhibition of another inhibitory T-cell receptor, cytotoxic T- 
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), with the mAb ipi[INVESTIGATOR_640226] (OS) in patients with melanoma in two phase 
[ADDRESS_856837] from CTLA-4 because it can 
be activated directly by [CONTACT_640292] T-cell response, 
19 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/[ADDRESS_856838] demonstrated durable objective responses in phase 1 and 2 trials. Nivolumab showed an overall response rate (ORR) of approximately 28% in subjects with advanced melanoma, 27% in subjects with RCC, and 18% in subjects with non- 
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had failed prior therapy
40. Pembrolizumab (MK-
3475) has shown an ORR of approximately 38% in patients with melanoma41 and ~20% 
in patients with NSCLC (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Development of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
The half-life (t 1/2) of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is approximately 4 weeks and there 
is no indication of dose dependency of half-life in the three dose groups (1, 3, and 10 
mg/kg) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014). The long t 1/2 supports a dosing interval of 
every 2 or 3 weeks. 
 
There was a dose-related increase in exposure from 1 to 10 mg/kg (Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2014). Serum concentrations of MK-3475 were lower by a factor of 
approximately 5 in patients receiving 2 mg/kg Q3W than in those receiving 10 mg/kg 
Q3W 41 (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014). Steady-state trough concentrations were 
20% greater in the patients receiving 10 mg/kg Q2W than in those receiving the same dose Q3W. 
 
Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) Data 
The occurrence of ADA has been observed in less than 1% of the patients screened, 
indicating a low potential of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) to elicit the formation of 
ADA (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014). No impact of ADA on MK-3475 exposure has 
been observed. 
 
Efficacy 
When treated with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) monotherapy, the ORR for IPI-
treated patients with melanoma (Part B) was 25%/27% according to the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)/investigator-assessed immune-related 
response criteria (irRC), respectively (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014). The ORR for IPI-naïve patients with melanoma (Parts B and D) was 39%/43% by 
[CONTACT_393]/investigator-assessed irRC, respectively. The majority of responses were 
seen in patients with melanoma by 16 weeks of therapy with pembrolizumab (MK-
3475); however, some responses have been reported after [ADDRESS_856839]-defined progression followed by a response has been observed. 
 
The preliminary objective response rate for 38 patients with NSCLC (Part C) was 
21%/24% by [CONTACT_393]/investigator-assessed irRC, respectively (Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2014). 
 
Pharmacodynamics/Biomarkers PD-L1 is being investigated as a predictive biomarker for pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 
treatment. At the 
20 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/2020  
 15th World Conference on Lung Cancer, Garon et al. presented preliminary data on a 
subset of patients suggesting that higher levels of tumor PD-L1 expression are associated with increased clinical activity.

3475 monotherapy for the treatment of previously treated patients with non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). J Thor Oncol . [ADDRESS_856840] 2:S364-365 ). Objective responses by [CONTACT_393] 
1.1 occurred in 4 out of 7 patients with higher levels of PD-L1 expression (57%, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 18-90%) vs. 2 out of 22 patients with lower levels of PD-L1 
expression (9%, 95% CI 1-29%).  These data are extremely preliminary, and PD-L1 
is not being used for patient s election. 
 
Biomarkers to evaluate immune modulation and markers in the tumor microenvironment, such as T-cell infiltration, the baseline expression of markers of T-cell suppression FoxP3 or the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3- 
dioxygenase (IDO) in tumor biopsies, were associated with a high response rate
42. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety data 
 
The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, nausea, cough, pruritus, diarrhea, and rash (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014). Most AEs were 
not considered serious. The most commonly reported immune-related AEs were rash, 
pruritus, vitiligo, hypothyroidism, arthralgia, diarrhea, and pneumonitis. 
 
Important identified risks include: pneumonitis, thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), colitis, diarrhea, hepatitis, nephritis, uveitis, rash/pruritus and 
neuropathy. 
 
2.2.2 Entinostat (NSC 706995) 
 
Entinostat, SNDX-275, an orally available synthetic pyridylcarbamate licensed from 
Bayer Schering AG by [CONTACT_640293]-275, inhibits 
HDACs. SNDX -[ADDRESS_856841] set of genes. This ultimately leads to the inhibition 
of cell proliferation, induction of terminal differentiation, and/or apoptosis
43. DNA within 
the cell nucleus combines with a class of proteins called histones to form chromatin. 
Histones have amino terminal groups that are positively charged and are hypo-acetylated by [CONTACT_178904]. The positive charge tightly binds the histones to the negatively charged DNA 
phosphodiester backbone. Gene transcription and expression are inhibited by [CONTACT_88318] a 
condensed conformation of the DNA. Histone acetyltransferases acetylate the amino terminal ends and neutralize their positive charges, thus leading to a more open chromatin 
conformation, facilitating DNA transcription. Altered activity of HDACs and inactivation 
of histone acetyltransferases within transformed cells are key events that affect chromatin 
remodeling. There is evidence that HDACs are associated with a wide range of tumors 
including melanomas, neuroblastomas, lymphomas, and lung, breast, prostate, ovarian, bladder, and colon cancers. In a number of in vitro models, HDAC inhibitors triggered 
growth arrest and induced cell differentiation or apoptosis. In acute promyelocytic 
leukemia, recruitment of HDACs by [CONTACT_640294]. 
21 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/2020  
 Entinostat inhibited HDAC in various tumor cell lines. In particular, entinostat induced 
accumulation of acetylated histones adjacent to the promoter of the transforming growth factor (TGF)- ȕW\SH,,UHFHSWRUJHQHZLWKUHVXOWLQJJHQHH[SUHVVLRQ0XWDWL RQV affecting

human malignancies, including carcinomas of the lung, breast, prostate, and colon. 
Entinostat also induced histone hyperacetylation and induced expression of various tumor 
suppressor genes. Various in vitro studies in a range of human cancer cell lines have demonstrated the 
antiproliferative activity of entinostat. In vivo , entinostat inhibited the growth of a range 
of human tumor xenografts, including models of lung, prostate, breast, pancreatic, renal cell, and glioblastoma. More recently, entinostat has been shown to modify the phenotype of cancer cells from a mesenchymal to an epi[INVESTIGATOR_640227], with impact on reducing the 
metastatic potential of the cancer cells
44. In addition, there is a suggestion that entinostat 
may have longer term effects on cancer phenotypes, cancer stem cells (CSCs) or 
progenitor cell pool and potential sensitization to subsequent post-study treatments45. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Entinostat in Patients with Solid Tumors, including Lung Cancer and 
Melanoma 
To date, entinostat has been investigated alone or in combination in >900 patients 
with cancer in clinical studies, including >600 patients with solid tumors, including 
NSCLC and melanoma. Entinostat has been investigated specifically in patients with NSCLC in combination with erlotinib in clinical studies sponsored by [CONTACT_640295] 5-azacitadine (AZA) in clinical studies sponsored by [CONTACT_6812]. Of 
the studies of entinostat in combination with AZA, evidence of the anti-tumor activity 
of this combination was demonstrated in an initial study
45, in which adults with 
metastatic NSCLC who experienced disease progression after at least 1 anticancer regimen received 7 mg of entinostat by [CONTACT_1966] (PO) on Days 3 and 10 and 30 or 40 mg/m2/day of AZA subcutaneously (SC) on Days 1-6 and 8-10 of a 28-day cycle. 
Of 31 evaluable patients, 1 experienced a CR, with a duration of 14 months; a second 
patient experienced a PR, with a duration of 8 months; and [ADDRESS_856842] 12 weeks. Furthermore, 4 patients had major objective 
responses to the immediate subsequent therapy. Based on these encouraging findings, 
the NCI has initiated a follow-up study utilizing this combination regimen to investigate the premise that epi[INVESTIGATOR_640228]. 
Evidence of the efficacy of entinostat also was seen in patients with Stage IV 
nonresectable melanoma, with 25% of patients experiencing disease stabilization
46. 
Based on these encouraging findings, further investigation of entinostat in combination was considered warranted in patients with melanoma. 
Overall, among all patients treated, entinostat has been well tolerated at the doses and 
schedules investigated. Regardless of indication and regimen, the most frequently 
reported AEs with entinostat included gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, primarily 
nausea with or without vomiting and diarrhea; fatigue; and hematologic 
abnormalities, primarily anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia. 
Most occurrences of these events are Grade 1 or 2 in severity and non-serious. Grade 3 and 4 hematologic abnormalities are commonly seen in patients with hematologic

[IP_ADDRESS]  Entinostat in Patients with MDS and AML 
One of the HDACs studied in MDS in entinostat: an orally bioavailable, isotype- 
selective class 1-specific HDACi with long half-life (100 hours). A phase I clinical 
trial published in abstract form at Johns Hopkins University combined entinostat with 
a lower dose, prolonged administration schedules of azacitidine22. In this trial, 
patients were treated with SQ azacitidine for 10 days at different dose levels (30, 40, 
or 50mg/m2/day) and given oral entinostat (2, 4, 6, 8 mg/m2/dose) on days 3 and 10. 
Out of 31 enrolled patients, 13 had MDS, 4 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and 14 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients were evaluable for response if they received 4 or more cycles of treatment. Of the 27 evaluable patients, 12 had responses (2 CR, 4 had partial responses [PR], and 6 bilineage hematologic 
improvement [HI]) according to the International Working Group [IWG] 2000 
criteria. The 50mg/m
2/day dose of azacitidine D1-10 and the entinostat 4 mg/m2/dose 
on D3 and D10 were subsequently studied in the randomized phase 2 ECOG1905 
study versus azacitidine monotherapy at the same 50mg/m2/day dose D1-D1023. Both 
arms achieved rates of trilineage hematologic normalization (32% for azacitidine monotherapy and 27% for combination) that were exceeded that of the historical control in which the standard regimen of azacitidine at 75mg/m2/day D1-7 was used 
(16% in CALBG9221 trial). While there was no survival advantage with the 
combination compared to azacitidine, this could potentially have been related to pharmacologic antagonism caused by [CONTACT_640289], a potent cell- cycle inhibitor with a long half-life of 4.5 days, in each cycle (day 3) which could 
have inhibited incorporation of azacitidine into DNA and subsequent cell cycling
23. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Development of Entinostat 
Potential Drug Interactions : Metabolism: Data from in vitro metabolism experiments 
in human tissues demonstrated that entinostat is not metabolized by [CONTACT_166113]47, 
but UGT 1A4 did metabolize entinostat to its M2 glucuronide metabolite. No metabolites could be detected after incubation of entinostat in human liver 
microsomes
47. While inhibition of CYP enzymes 2B6 and 3A4 was seen, the data 
show that the degree of the inhibition makes it unlikely that any in vivo systemic 
interactions would occur. Intestinal CYP 3A4 may be inhibited by [CONTACT_166120]. 
However, entinostat did not inhibit any UGT enzymes tested. Entinostat was found to 
induce CYP 1A2, CYP 2C6, and CYP 2B8 as well as UGT 1A4. Finally, entinostat 
was found to be a substrate for P-gp and BCRP transporters, but did not inhibit either of these transport proteins. 
23 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/2020  
 Patient Care Implications: 
Entinostat may cause fatigue or malaise; advise patient to exercise caution while driving a vehicle or operating machinery. 
 
Administration of entinostat is contraindicated in patients with a history of allergy 
to entinostat or other medications that have a benzamide structure (eg, tiapride, 
remoxipride, clebropride). 
Careful monitoring of patients for signs of infection or reactivation of past 
infections is recommended, as reactivation of infection has been reported in 
patients treated with entinostat, in some cases without evidence of neutropenia. The clinical significance of this finding and the potential association with 
entinostat is unknown. 
 
Entinostat must not be used during pregnancy or while breast-feeding. Women 
and men participating in entinostat clinical studies must agree to use acceptable 
contraceptive methods, as indicated in the clinical study protocol, during 
treatment and for 4 months thereafter. 
 
2.3 Rationale for combining anti-PD1 antibody with entinostat in MDS after DNMTi 
failure 
More recently, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were found to be significantly 
expanded in Bone marrows of p atients with MDS and to play an im portant role in the pathogenesis 
of the disease especially in driving ineffective hematopoiesis14. In another very provoking study 
by [CONTACT_146360], the authors demonstrated in murine models with metastatic tumors that MDSCs can mediate resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. In this study, treatment with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 inhibitor antibodies could not eliminate CT26 tumors or 
metastatic 4T1 tumors 
15. Interestingly, when the animals were co-treated with epi[INVESTIGATOR_640229], the outcomes improved significantly with cure rates in excess of 80% of the tumor-bearing mice. Specifically, the use of anti-PD1 + anti-CTLA-4 with 
azacitidine plus entinostat or the combination of the antibodies with entinostat alone eradicated the 
tumors while when the antibody combination was used with azacitidine monotherapy the primary tumors were not eradicated. Azacitidine and entinostat (alone or together) in absence of the immune-checkpoint inhibitors also failed to eradicate the tumors. These findings suggested that

2.4 Correlative Studies Background (full correlative proposal attached in  Appendix J ) 
 
The role of MDSCs in MDS and the preclinical data of HDACi to suppress MDSCs: 
Myelopoiesis is altered in cancer, which induces expansion of relatively immature and activated 
myeloid cells, now called MDSCs48. MDSCs have been reported to facilitate tumor metastasis 
and angiogenesis49-51. Recently, MDSCs were found to be significantly expanded in bone 
marrows of patients with MDS and to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease

cancers15. Interestingly, when the animals were co-treated with epi[INVESTIGATOR_640230] (i.e. 
ENT+AZA or ENT alone) in addition to the antibodies, the outcomes improved significantly 
with cure rates in excess of 80% of the tumor-bearing mice15. Importantly, AZA and ENT (alone 
or together) in absence of the immune-checkpoint inhibitors also failed to eradicate the tumors. These findings suggested that the combination of the class [ADDRESS_856846]- ENT/anti-PD1 therapy to achieve our primary goal of this study via 
Specific Aim 1. 
 
PD-L1 expression in MDS and its correlation with the response to anti-PD1 therapy: Kondo 
and et al. demonstrated that PD-L1-positive MDS blasts have an intrinsic proliferative advantage 
and induce T-cell suppression through interactions with PD-1 receptors potentially contributing 
to disease progression
12. They also showed in BM samples, blasts from HR-MDS patients 
expressed PD-L1 molecules more often compared with those from LR-MDS p atients while the 
BM T-cells over-expressed PD-1 mo lecules12. The MD Anderson group studied mRNA in 
CD34+ cells from 124 patients with MDS, AML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia 
(CMML) and found that 34%, 15%, and 8% had aberrant up-regulation ( စ2-fold) in PD-L1, PD- 
1 and CTLA4, respectively13. PD-L1 protein expression was observed in MDS CD34+ cells, 
whereas stromal and non-blast cellular elements were pos itive for PD -1. More importantly, in a 
subgroup of patients treated with DNMTi therapy, PD-L1, PD-[ADDRESS_856847] the 
PD-1/PD-L1 axis might mediate resistance to DNMTi therapy and provide rationale for using immune checkpoint blockade with an anti-PD1 antibody as a novel therapeutic approach to improve outcomes of HR-MDS patients. However, preliminary results from ongoing early phase 
clinical trials of ant-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents in MDS patients s uggest that immune 
checkpoint therapy as a monotherapy only leads to disease stabilization in some patients but very few responses. This observation provides rationale for combining immune checkpoint therapy 
with other novel agents with distinct mechanisms of action to improve patient outcomes. 
Additionally, there is no single biomarker to predict the response to anti-PD1 therapy in cancers.

included in all NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research projects involving NIH- defined clinical research unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes to 
the satisfaction of the funding Institute & Center (IC) Director that inclusion is inappropriate 
with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. Exclusion under other 
circumstances must be designated by [CONTACT_25513], NIH, upon the recommendation of an IC 
Director based on a compelling rationale and justification. Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources. Women of 
childbearing potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical research.

4.3 Patient Registration 
 
4.3.1 OPEN / IWRS 
 
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN). OPEN is a web-based registration system available to users on a 24/7 basis. It is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data interchange 
and with the Theradex Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for retrieval of patient 
registration/randomization assignment. Patient enrollment data entered by [CONTACT_33979] / IWRS will automatically transfer to the NCI’s clinical data management system, 
Medidata Rave. 
 
The OPEN system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registration and 
treatment information. Please print this confirmation for your records. 
 
For trials with slot reservation requirements, OPEN will connect to IWRS at enrollment 
initiation to check slot availability. Registration staff should ensure that a slot is 
31 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/2020  
 available and secured for the patient before completing an enrollment. 
 
4.3.2 OPEN/IWRS User Requirements 
 
OPEN/IWRS users must meet the following requirements: 
x Have a valid CTEP-IAM account ( i.e., CTEP username [CONTACT_2383]). 
x To enroll patients or request slot reservations: Be on an ETCTN Corresponding 
or Participating Organization roster with the role of Registrar. Registrars must 
hold a minimum of an AP registration type. 
x To approve slot reservations or access cohort management: Be identified to 
Theradex as the “Client Admin” for the study. 
x Have regulatory approval for the conduct of the study at their s ite. 
 
Prior to accessing OPEN/IWRS, site staff should verify the following:

with azacitidine (a drug which has more myelosuppressive potential than pembrolizumab). This E1905 study was a randomized phase 2 study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) of 10 days of AZA (50 
mg/m(2)/d) +/- entinostat (4 mg/m2) given on days 3 and 10 of each cycle and enrolled 149

 of 4mg/m2 based on a study that showed BSA-based dosing is not more accurate than fixed

PART 1: 
 
 
The ENT monotherapy run-in part (cycle 1) will allow to study the changes in myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) at pre- and post- ENT treatment (the end of cycle 1) to 
dissect the effects of ENT monotherapy from those of the combined ENT/anti-PD1 therapy. 
 
We will perform ‘3+3’ classical dose escalation design to determine dose limiting toxicity 
(DLT). The first 3 patients will receive ENT at dose level 1 (DL1: 8mg on D1, 8 of 21-day cycles). pembrolizumab (MK-3475) will be added starting day 1 cycle 2 at the approved dose of 
200mg intravenously [IV] over 30 minutes on D1 of 21-day cycles) for 4 cycles (cycle 2-5). A 
safety committee that includes the study chair, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_640233] a patient on the specific DL, as well as two sub-investigators from Yale will review 
safety data after enrollment of every [ADDRESS_856866] 3 treated patients in that dose level if there are toxicity/safety concerns 
that did not qualify as DLT (maximum of 6 evaluable patients to be enrolled at any dose level). 
The committee can also decide to enroll patients at a lower dose level after the first [ADDRESS_856867] 6 patients enrolled in any dose level even if no or one DLT occurred at that dose level if there are toxicity/safety concerns that did not qualify as DLT. The following regarding 
enrollment in different dose levels will be considered guidance for the safety committee but can 
be modified in accordance of above: If no patient of the 3 patients treated with combined therapy 
at DL1 develops DLT, then dose level 2 (DL2) will be tested. For instance, DL2 will be with 
ENT at 8mg on D1, 8 and 15 and pembrolizumab (MK-3475) at 200mg IV on D1 of 21-day 
cycles. If 1 patient out of the 3 patients has DLT at DL1, we will expand cohort to 3 more 
patients and if 1 patient of the 6 patients has DLT (i.e. only 0/3 or 1/6), we will test next dose 
(DL2). If no patient of the 3 patients treated with combined therapy at DL2 develop DLT, then 
DL2 will be used for part 2 (expansion cohort). If 1 patient out of the 3 patients has DLT at DL2, 
we will expand cohort to 3 more patients and if 1 patient of the 6 patients has DLT (i.e. only 0/3 or 1/6), dose level 2 (DL2) will be used for part 2 (expansion cohort). If [ADDRESS_856868] DLT, DL1 will be used for expansion cohort. The cycle duration will be 21 days, 
the maximum number of treatment cycles of entinostat will be 18 cycles and for pembrolizumab 
(MK-3475) the maximum number of cycles will be 17. Cycle [ADDRESS_856869] concurrent 
administration. In all the phases of the study, entinostat will be administered in clinic within 2 
hours before administration of pembrolizumab (MK-3475). Entinostat will be stored at the 
pharmacy and it will not be given for the patient to take home. 
 
 
An additional dose level (DL -1) in which day 8 of ENT will be omitted (i.e. ENT at 8mg on D1, and pembrolizumab (MK-3475) at 200mg IV on D1 of 21-day cycles) will be used if [ADDRESS_856870] 2 cycles of combined therapy at DL1. If 0 or 1 
patients of the 6 patients treated with combined therapy at DL-1 develop DLT then DL-1 will be used in the second part of the study. If 2 or more 6 patients enrolled in DL -1 develop 
35 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]

 DLT, then the study w ill be terminated. 
 
Toxicities will be tabulated and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events Version 5 (CTCAE-5). DLT will be assessed after the first 2 cycles of 
combined therapy. Responses will be as defined by [CONTACT_57937]-2006 criteria (CR, PR, or HI) and 
assessed at the end of the combined first 2 cycles, and every 2 cycles afterwards. Patients 
who achieve an objective response or maintain a stable disease (SD) status after the first 4 combination cycles will continue receiving both drugs at the same schedule till progression 
up to 1 year of combined therapy. 
 
PART 2: After the safe dose of the combination is established, 15 patients will be treated 
with ENT+ pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combination at that same dose and schedule. Assessment of response will occur after 4 combination cycles and similar to part 1, those 
who achieve an objective response or SD will continue to receive the therapy till progression. 
Patients who progress or respond and subsequently lose response will be withdrawn from 
study. BM biopsy/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640234], after first cycle of ENT

5.1.1 Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 
 
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all 
procedures/assessments have been completed. Trial treatment may be administered up to 
1 day (calendar states +/- 1 day window, so does Entinostat dosing, and needs to be 
administered within 2 hours after entinostat dose so needs to be 1 day window) before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons. 
 
Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is added on day one of each subsequent cycle starting 
Cycle 2. Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) trea tment will be administered on an 
outpatient basis. 
 
Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) w ill be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion (treatment 
cycle intervals may be increased due to toxicity as described in Section 6.1). Infusion 
timing should be as close to 30 minutes as possible; however, a window of -5 minutes 
and +10 minutes is permitted ( i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).

hours after a meal. Entinostat is supplied as pi[INVESTIGATOR_22759] (1 mg) or yellow (5 mg) 
coated tablets. Entinostat is to be stored at controlled room temperature (15ºC to 25ºC) in 
a secure, locked storage area to which access is limited. Entinostat is to be protected from light. Entinostat is not to be exposed to extremes of temperature (greater than 30ºC or less 
than 5ºC). The medication will be dispensed in the clinic. Administration one day prior to 
or one day after the scheduled day will be allowed.

5.2 Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
 
The primary endpoint is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which is the highest dose level 
where 1 or fewer of 6 participants experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first two combined cycles of treatment. The recommend phase 2 dose (RP2D) is the same as the MTD. 
37 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/2020  
 The maximally administered dose is the dose at which two or more of 6 participants experience a 
38 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/[ADDRESS_856873] 2 cycles of combined 
therapy unless the event can clearly be determined to be unrelated to the study drugs. 
 
 Any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity with the following exceptions: A) Transient 
laboratory abnormalities that can be treated or resolve to grade 2 or less within 72 hours. 
 Grade 4 hematologic toxicity, including treatment-associated aplasia lasting >[ADDRESS_856874] 2 cycles of combined therapy without experiencing a 
DLT (as DLT period is defined in the first 2 combined therapy cycles) during dose escalation will 
also be replaced. To be DLT-evaluable, the patient must complete the first two cycles of combined 
therapy without experiencing a DLT. Any patient who is dose reduced during the entinostat run- in first cycle due to entinostat-related toxicity will be analyzed on the dose level that corresponds 
to the reduced dose level delivered during the first cycle of combined therapy. 
 
A safety committee that includes the study chair, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_640235] a patient on the specific DL, as well as two sub-investigators from Yale will review safety data after enrollment of every [ADDRESS_856875] 3 treated patients in that dose level if there are toxicity/safety 
concerns that did not qualify as DLT (maximum of 6 evaluable patients to be enrolled at any 
dose level). The committee can also decide to enroll patients at a lower dose level after the first [ADDRESS_856876] 6 patients enrolled in any dose level even if no or one DLT occurred at that dose 
level if there are toxicity/safety concerns that did not qualify as DLT. The following regarding enrollment in different dose levels will be considered guidance for the safety committee but can 
be modified in accordance of above. Dose escalation will proceed within each cohort according 
to the following scheme.

is defined in the first 2 combined therapy cycles) will also be replaced. To be DLT-evaluable, the 
patient must complete the first two cycles of combined therapy without experiencing a DLT. Any 
patient who is dose reduced during the entinostat run-in first cycle due to entinostat-related toxi city 
will be analyzed on the dose level that corresponds to the reduced dose level delivered during the first cycle of combined therapy. 
 
The following early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_640236]: We will cease enrollment in the expansion phase at the dose determined from dose escalation part of 
the study if we observe two or more DLTs among the first six evaluable patients enrolled in the 
expansion cohort. An evaluable patient is any patient who received a study drug. If the true 
toxicity rate is 50% or greater at the MTD then this rule will stop the trial with probability at 
least .89. Similarly, if the true toxicity rate is 33% at the MTD then this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_640220] .65. In that event, a new expansion cohort will start at the dose level 
immediately below the dose level that was expanded. If the dose level being expanded is dose 
level -1, then the study w ill be terminated. 
Monitoring of all safety and toxicity data is done by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_640237] a real-time basis as data are entered into Medidata Rave using 
the Web Reporting Module. All participating sites are expected to notify the Principal

5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines 
40 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/[ADDRESS_856880] of drugs to avoid or minimize use 
of. Appendix F (Patient Drug Information Handout and Wallet Card) should be provided to 
patients if available. 
 
5.4.1 Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Concomitant Medication 
 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with 
CTEP. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator 
and/or the subject's primary physician; however, the decision to continue the subject on trial 
therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the Investigator, CTEP, and 
the patient. 
 
Acceptable Concomitant Medications 
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a patient’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983]. All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and 
fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, 
and date may also be included on the CRF. 
 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_856881] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs. 
 
Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retreatment for post-complete response relapse) of this trial: 
 Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy. 
 Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol. 
 Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol. 
 Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab (MK-3475). 
 Radiation therapy 
41 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/2020  
 o Note: Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
allowed after consultation with Sponsor. 
 Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_856882] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus 
vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines ( e.g. Flu-Mist
®) are live 
attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed. 
 Glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
suspected immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be 
approved after consultation with the Sponsor. 
 
Patients who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial. Patients may receive other 
medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary. 
 
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial. 
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927]-Trea tment Follow -up Phase. 
Co-administration of drugs sensitive substrates of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 
with a narrow therapeutic window are permitted, as it appears that entinostat is unlikely to inhibit these enzymes in humans. 
 
 
5.5 Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for one year 
(maximum 18 cycles or entinostat and maximum 17 cycles of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) or 
until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
x Disease progression as defined in modified IWG-2006 (Appendix A1 , Appendix 
A2) for MDS 
 
x If disease has shown evidence of progression based on an increase in the blast counts 
according to the modified IWG-2006, but the patient is otherwise clinically stable and 
his transfusion requirement have not changed, the investigator can give two additional 
cycles of combined treatment and bone marrow biopsy will be repeated after that 
cycle. If repeat bone marrow biopsy confirms disease progression, the patient will be taken off the trial. 
 
x Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
 
x Patient decides to withdraw from the study

hypophysitis) adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone replacement may resume treatment after replacement correction and clinically stable regimen. 
 
If the criteria to resume treatment are met, the patient should restart treatment no sooner than the next scheduled time point per protocol. However, if the treatment is delayed past the next scheduled time point per protocol, the treatment should resume at the ear liest c onvenient point 
that is within the 12 week delay period. 
 
If treatment is delayed >[ADDRESS_856898] be permanently discontinued from study 
therapy, except as specified in Section 5.4 (Duration of Therapy). 
 
5.9 Treatment Beyond Progression 
 
Immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab (MK-3475) may produce antitumor 
effects by [CONTACT_134981]-specific immune responses. The response patterns 
seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_640239], and can manifest as a clinical res ponse after an initial increase in 
tumor burden.

noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons. 
 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
Although entinostat and pembrolizumab (MK-3475) have distinct toxicity profiles, they do share some AEs 
such as fatigue and nausea. There is the theoretical possibility that 1 agent may potentiate the 
other and hence drug causality will not always be clear. In the event of uncertainty, dose 
reductions and/or delays will follow the most conservative approach (i.e., delays and/or dose 
reductions for both drugs) until resolution of the event. No dose reductions will be performed for pembrolizumab (MK-3475). Guidance for delays and or dose reductions for entinostat are 
presented.

free for 12 hours (maximum dosage: 16 mg/24 hours) 
Adjunct anti-diarrheal therapy is permitted and should be recorded when used.
For other non-hematological toxicities that are grade 2 and do not resolve within a week, the 
investigator can reduce the entinostat dosing by [CONTACT_30560] (e.g. go from DL2 dosing to DL1 
dosing). 
Given the frequent occurrence of severe cytopenias among patients with MDS and AML which 
are disease and not drug related and that worsening of cytopenias is a common occurrence during 
the disease course, the below dose modifications of entinostat for hematologic adverse events are 
considered guidance for the treating investigator and not mandatory. The decision to modify/hold 
dose will be at the discretion of the treating investigator and should include consideration of the clinical situation including severity consideration of baseline counts.

Immune-related adverse events (irAEs), defined as AEs of unknown etiology, associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune phenomenon, may be predicted based on the 
49 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date: 09/04/2020  
 nature of the pembrolizumab (MK-3475) compound, its mechanism of action, and reported 
experience with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_89149] a similar mechanism of action. Special attention should be paid to AEs that may be suggestive of potential irAEs. An irAE can occur shortly 
after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. All AEs of unknown 
etiology associated with drug exposure should be evaluated to determine if they are possibly 
immune-related. If an irAE is suspected, efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic,

whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, 
administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. KEYTRUDA will be 
resumed when the immune-mediated adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following 
corticosteroid taper. KEYTRUDA will be permanently discontinue for any Grade 3 immune- 
mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse 
reaction. The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occ urred in 
less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients treated with KEYTRUDA: arthritis 
(1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures 
arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma.”

 AE-specific pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Dose Modifications and Supportive Care Guidelines: 
The table below includes recommendations on the management of specific AEs and when to hold and/or discontinue pembrolizumab (MK-3475). These guidelines are intended to be applied 
when the investigator determines the events to be treatment-related. Note: if after the evaluation 
the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does not need to follow the treatment 
guidance. Therefore, these recommendations should be seen as guidelines and the treating 
physician should exercise individual clinical judgment based on the pa tient. 
Given the frequent occurrence of severe cytopenias among patients with MDS and AML which 
are disease and not drug related and that worsening of cytopenias is a common occurrence during 
the disease course, the below dose modifications of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)  for hematologic 
adverse events are considered guidance for the treating investigator and not mandatory. The 
decision to modify/hold dose will be at the discretion of the treating investigator and should include consideration of the clinical situation including severity consideration of baseline counts.

 7. ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE ( Section s 7.2 and 
7.3) will determine whether the event requires expedited reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System(CTEP-AERS) in addition to routine reporting 
 
7.[ADDRESS_856926](s) (CAEPRs) 
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset of AEs, 
the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column 
and is identified with bold and italicized text. The SPEER is a list of events that are protocol- 
specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below). Refer to the 'CTEP, 
NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm for further clarification. 
 
NOTE : The highest grade currently reported is noted in parentheses next to the AE in the 
SPEER. Report ONLY AEs higher than this grade expeditiously. If this CAEPR is part of a 
combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.

7.5 Secondary Malignancy 
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported expeditiously via CTEP-AERS. Three options are available to 
describe the event: 
 
x Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML]) 
x Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS) 
x Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. 
 
7.6 Second Malignancy 
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE

hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, pregnancy loss, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth 
must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to 
term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 
 
 
8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
 
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational agents 
administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1 . 
 
 
8.1 CTEP IND Agent(s) 
 
 
8.1.1 Entinostat ( NSC 706995) 
 
Chemical name: 3-Pyridylmethyl N-55carbamate 
 
Other names: MS-27-275, MS-275, SNDX-275 
 
Classification: Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) 
 
Molecular formula: C21H20N4O3 
 
M.W.: 376.41 
 
Mode of Action: Histone deacetylases ( HDACs) are a family of enzymes that regulate 
chromatin remodeling and gene transcription via the dynamic  
process of acetylation and deacetylation of core histones. Entinostat 
inhibits histone deacetylases, changes chromatin configuration, and 
induces differentiation and apoptosis of cancer cells through an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_166099]. 
 
How Supplied: Entinostat is supplied by [CONTACT_640301], Inc. and 
distributed by [CONTACT_52375], NCI as 1 mg (pi[INVESTIGATOR_22759], in bottles of 
40), or 5 mg (yellow, in bottles of 40) film-coated tablets (round- 
76                 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
                Version Date: 09/04/2020  
 biconvex). Each tablet also contains mannitol, sodium starch 
glycolate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, potassium bicarbonate, and 
magnesium stearate. The film coating consists of hypromellose, 
talc, titanium dioxide, and ferric oxide pi[INVESTIGATOR_165639] (red and yellow) as colorants. 
 
Matching placebo for entinostat has the same appearance as the 
corresponding active tablets and contains the same inactive 
ingredients and film coating. 
 
Storage: Store the bottles at controlled room temperature (15-25oC), and 
protect from light. Entinostat is not to be exposed to extremes of 
temperature (greater than 30ºC or less than 5ºC). 
 
Stability: Shelf life stability studies of the intact bottles are on-going. 
 
Route of Administration: Oral, on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 
hours after a meal. Entinostat tablets should not be split, 
crushed, or chewed. 
 
Potential Drug Interactions: Metabolism: Data from in vitro metabolism experiments 
in human tissues demonstrated that entinostat is not metabolized by [CONTACT_166113] 
(Acharya 2006), but UGT 1A4 did metabolize entinostat to its M2 glucuronide 
metabolite. No metabolites could be detected after incubation of entinostat in human liver microsomes (Acharya 2006). While inhibition of CYP enzymes 2B6 and 3A4 was seen, 
the data show that the degree of the inhibition makes it unlikely that any in vivo systemic 
interactions would occur. Intestinal CYP 3A4 may be inhibited by [CONTACT_166120]. However, 
entinostat did not inhibit any UGT enzymes tested. Entinostat was found to induce CYP 
1A2, CYP 2C6, and CYP 2B8 as well as UGT 1A4. Finally, entinostat was found to be a substrate for P-gp and BCRP transporters, but did not inhibit either of these transport 
proteins. 
 
 
Patient Care Implications: 
 
Entinostat may cause fatigue or malaise; advise patient to exercise caution while driving 
a vehicle or operating machinery. 
 
Administration of entinostat is contraindicated in patients with a history of allergy to 
entinostat or other medications that have a benzamide structure (eg, tiapride, remoxipride, 
clebropride). 
Careful monitoring of patients for signs of infection or reactivation of past infections is 
recommended, as reactivation of infection has been reported in patients treated with 
entinostat, in some cases without evidence of neutropenia. The clinical significance of 
this finding and the potential association with entinostat is unknown.

2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses 
at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). 
4: An additional safety assessment will be done before each maintenance dose. 
5: Bone marrow assessment will be performed in patients at baseline (before cycle 1), after 
cycles 1 (entinostat alone) and then every 2 cycles of entinostat and Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 
dose. At baseline, bone marrows will be sent for analysis of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], biopsy, flow cytometry, iron stain, correlative studies, cytogenetics and FISH. FISH panel will include probes to identify 
5q-, 7q-, trisomy 8, 20q-. Follow-up bone marrows will be analyzed for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], biopsy, and 
flow cytometry. Cytogenetics will be sent after cycle 2, 4 and subsequent bone marrow studies. 
85                 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
                Version Date: 09/04/2020  
 Iron stains and FISH will be repeated at discretion of investigator. 
6: Survival follow-up should be obtained monthly from time of study drug discontinuation or 
disease progression, whichever occurs first, for [ADDRESS_856949] criteria of modified IWG-2006 guidelines (Appendix A1 and 
Appendix A2 ). Responses in AML patients will be assessed using IWG 2003 criteria 
(Appendix A3 ). In addition to a baseline bone marrow biopsy and scan, bone marrow biopsy 
will be performed at baseline, after cycles [ADDRESS_856950] 
treatment with Entinostat in combination with Pembrolizumab (MK -3475) 
 
Evaluable for objective response. Only those patients who have measurable disease present 
at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- 
evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective 
disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
11.2 Response criteria 
 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
Responses for MDS patients will be defined as in the modified IWG-2006 criteria 
(Appendix A1 and Appendix A1 ). These response criteria do not apply to AML as these 
patients are required to be in full remission by [CONTACT_224839]. Only relapse and survival 
as measured by [CONTACT_640303]. The OS and PFS will be measured for both AML and MDS as described in 
Appendix A1 and Appendix A2 . 
Duration of response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met. 
 
Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) 
The definitions below are consistent with those detailed by [CONTACT_27856], et al for MDS61 except 
that, as discussed earlier, for disease progression based on BM blast percentage, the patient 
must exceed 10% absolute BM blast percentage in addition to increasing above 50% of BM 
blast percentage at baseline to count as disease progression. 
86                 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
                Version Date: 09/04/2020  
  
Complete response is defined by [CONTACT_640304] <5% myeloblasts with normal 
trilineage maturation without dysplasia. When erythroid precursors constitute <50% of 
marrow cells, the blast percentage is based on total nucleated cells; otherwise, the blast percentage is based on non-erythroid compartment. Peripheral blood criteria consist of 
Hemoglobin >11 gm/dl, ANC > 1 x 109/L, Platelets > 100 x 109/L, absence of peripheral 
blood blasts, all in the absence of transfusions and growth factors. 
Partial response is defined by [CONTACT_640305] >50% from pretreatment levels and/or achievement of a less advanced 
MDS FAB classification. 
Stable Disease i s defined by [CONTACT_640306] [ADDRESS_856951] percentages: 
For patients with <5% blasts: >50% increase in blasts to >10% 
For patients with 5-10% blasts: >50% increase in blasts to >10% 
For patients with >10-20% blasts: >50% increase in blasts to >20% 
For patients with >20-30% blasts: >50% increase in blasts to >30% 
In addition, there must be >1 of the following criteria: >50% decrease from maximum 
response levels in granulocytes or platelets, a decrease in hemoglobin concentration by [CONTACT_12697] 2 gm/dl, or becoming transfusion dependent. 
 
11.3 Other response parameters 
 
Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) will be recorded from start of study 
to progression or death (PFS), or time from start of study to death (OS).

 or more frequently, conference calls with the Study Investigators and the CTEP Medical 
Officer(s) to review accrual, progress, and adverse events and unanticipated problems. 
 
All Study Investigators at participating sites who register/enroll patients on a given protocol are 
responsible for timely submission of data via Medidata Rave and timely reporting of adverse 
events for that particular study. This includes timely review of data collected on the electronic CRFs submitted via Medidata Rave. 
All studies are also reviewed in accordance with the enrolling institution’s data safety monitoring 
plan. 
There are two safety/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_640263]: 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] 1: Delayed immune related toxicity from dose escalation phase. If 4 or more 
patients in any dose level develop delayed protocol defined immune related grade 3/4 events, we 
will halt further therapy on that dose level 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] 2: Excess toxicity in the expansion cohort. We will cease enrollment in the 
expansion phase at the dose determined from the dose escalation part of the study if we observe 
two or more DLTs among the first six evaluable patients enrolled in the expansion cohort. An 
evaluable patient is any patient who received a st udy drug. If the true toxicity rate is 50% or 
greater at the MTD then this rule will stop the trial with probability at least .89. S imilarly, if the 
true toxicity rate is 33% at the MTD then this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_640264] .65. 
In that event, a new expansion cohort will start at the dose level immediately below the dose 
level that was expanded. If the dose level being expanded is dose level -1, then the study will be 
terminated.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
This will be a phase 1b study [schema]. The proposed dosing of ENT has been previously 
tested in MDS and showed to be well-tolerated. While the combination of ENT with the anti- PD1, Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has not been studied clinically in MDS patients, it is 
unlikely that this combination would have overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685]. 
 
PART 1: ENT has been previously evaluated as a single agent therapy in patients with MDS 
at these doses and has been well tolerated. The ENT monotherapy run-in part (cycle 1) will allow to study the changes in myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) at pre- and post- 
ENT treatment (the end of cycle 1) to dissect the effects of ENT monotherapy from those of 
the combined ENT/anti-PD1 therapy. 
 
We will perform ‘3+3’ classical dose escalation design to determine dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The first 3 patients will receive ENT at dose level 1 (DL1: 8mg on D1, 8 of 21-day 
cycles). Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) will be added starting day 1 cycle 2 at the approved dose 
of 200mg intravenously [IV] over 30 minutes on D1 of 21-day cycles) for [ADDRESS_856962] 3 treated patients in that dose level if there are 
toxicity/safety concerns that did not qualify as DLT (maximum of 6 evaluable patients to be 
enrolled at any dose level). The committee can also decide to enroll patients at a lower dose level after the first [ADDRESS_856963] 6 patients enrolled in any dose level even if no or one 
DLT occurred at that dose level if there are toxicity/safety concerns that did not qualify as 
DLT. The following regarding enrollment in different dose levels will be considered 
guidance for the safety committee but can be modified in accordance of above: If no patient 
of the 3 patients treated with combined therapy at DL1 develops DLT, then dose level 2 (DL2) will be tested. For instance, DL2 will be with ENT at 8mg on D1, 8 and 15 and MK- 
3475 (pembrolizumab) at 200mg IV on D1 of 21-day cycles. If 1 patient out of the 3 patients 
has DLT at DL1, we will expand cohort to 3 more patients and if 1 patient of the 6 patients 
has DLT (i.e. only 0/3 or 1/6), we will test next dose (DL2). If no patient of the 3 patients 
treated with combined therapy at DL2 develop DLT, then DL2 will be used for part 2 (expansion cohort). If 1 patient out of the 3 patients has DLT at DL2, we will expand cohort 
to 3 more patients and if 1 patient of the 6 patients has DLT (i.e only 0/3 or 1/6), dose level 2

 (DL2) will be used for part 2 (expansion cohort). If [ADDRESS_856964] 
DLT, DL1 will be used for expansion cohort. 
An additional dose level (DL -1) in which day 8 of ENT will be omitted (i.e. ENT at 8mg on 
D1, and Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) at 200mg IV on D1 of 21-day cycles) will be used if [ADDRESS_856965] 2 cycles of combined therapy at DL1. If 0 or 1 
patients of the 6 patients treated with combined therapy at DL-1 develop DLT then DL-1 will 
be used in the second part of the study. If 2 or more 6 patients enrolled in DL -1 develop 
DLT, then the study will be termin ated. 
Toxicities will be tabulated and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5 (CTCAE-5). DLT will be assessed after the first 2 cycles of 
combined therapy. Responses will be as defined by [CONTACT_57937]-2006 criteria (CR, PR, or HI) and 
assessed at the end of cycle 1, the combined first 2 cycles, and every 2 cycles afterwards. 
Patients who achieve an objective response or maintain a stable disease (SD) status after the 
first [ADDRESS_856966] 2 
cycles of combined therapy without experiencing a DLT during dose escalation (as DLT period 
is defined in the first 2 combined therapy cycles) will also be replaced. To be DLT-evaluable, 
the patient must complete the first two cycles of combined therapy without experiencing a 
DLT. Any patient who is dose reduced during the entinostat run-in first cycle due to entinostat- 
related toxicity will be analyzed on the dose level that corresponds to the reduced dose level 
delivered during the first cycle of combined therapy. 
 
PART 2: After the safe dose of the combination is established, 15 patients will be treated 
with ENT+ Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combination at that same dose and schedule. 
Assessment of response will occur after 4 combination cycles and similar to part 1, those 
who achieve an objective response or SD will continue to receive the therapy till progression. 
Patients who progress or respond and subsequently lose response will be withdrawn from study. BM biopsy/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640234], after first cycle of ENT 
monotherapy, every [ADDRESS_856967] 5 cycles (i.e. 1 ENT monotherapy cycle and 4 cycles 
of combined therapy (DL1, DL2) for each patient) to assess for any unexpected autoimmune or other toxicity. 
 
Primary Endpoint(s): MTD will be defined by [CONTACT_640307] 2 dose 
schedules (see section 5.2) 
Definitions of DLT: see section 5.2 
 
 
The following early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_640236]: 
We will cease enrollment in the expansion phase at the dose determined from dose escalation 
part of the study if we observe two or more DLTs among the first six evaluable patients 
enrolled in the expansion cohort. An evaluable patient is any patient who received a study 
drug. If the true toxicity rate is 50% or greater at the MTD then this rule will stop the trial with probability at least .89. Similarly, if the true toxicity rate is 33% at the MTD then this 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_640220] .65. In that event, a new expansion cohort will

 start at the dose level immediately below the dose level that was expanded. If the dose level 
being expanded is dose level -1, then the study will be terminated. 
 
Secondary Endpoint(s): Overall response rate (CR, PR, and HI) as defined by [CONTACT_640308] 2006 (IWG-2006) criteria for CR, PR, HI (Appendix A1 and 
Appendix A2 ) with at least 15% to be continued 
 
Exploratory Endpoint(s): 
x Median response duration for responders, median time of progression to AML, median 
overall survival (OS) and 1- and 2-year OS rate 
x Assessment of the dynamic quantitative change in proportion of MDSCs in BM with 
combined therapy (target of reducing to <10%) and correlation with any observed clinical responses

The total number of patients enrolled in the study will range from 21 to 27. The null 
hypothesis response rate of 1% (only supportive care) will be rejected if we observe [ADDRESS_856969]. This criterion has power between .84 and .93 for testing an alternative response 
rate of 15% with the combination therapy. Therefore, we will treat a total of 21 patients in the 
combination arm ([ADDRESS_856970] part of the study and 15 in the second part of the study).

13.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
Overall response rate: defined by [CONTACT_640309] 2006 (IWG-2006) criteria 
for CR, PR, HI (Appendix A1 and Appendix A2 ). We will also record PFS and OS for the 
94                 NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
                Version Date: 09/04/2020  
 MDS. These endpoints will be assessed after cycle 2 and 4 of induction therapy, and every 3 
months during follow-up. Bone marrow biopsies will be done at baseline, after 1 cycle and 
then every 2 cycles, at end of study, and as clinically indicated (e.g. suspi[INVESTIGATOR_55519], 
decreasing blood counts). We aim to obtain preliminary efficacy data of entinostat in combination with Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in terms of CR, PR, HI as defined by [CONTACT_57937]- 
[ADDRESS_856971] 95% confidence interval. Median PFS and OS will also be reported 
with a 95% confidence interval. 
The quantitative change in MDSCs (% MDSCs by [CONTACT_4133], QIF score by [CONTACT_485200]) 
during treatment with the ENT/anti-PD1 combined therapy will be estimated using mixed 
effects models to take into account the within-patient c orrelation. Likelihood ratio tests w ill 
be performed to confirm if random intercepts and slopes are necessary in the model. The 
fixed effect for change in MDSCs over time will be evaluated for significance. The 
variability in the rate of change in MDSCs across patients will also be examined. The association between the clinical outcome and a meaningful reduction in MDSCs, which will 
be defined after a review of the data, will be assessed with the chi-square test. The quantity of 
MDSCs at baseline and during treatment as continuous variables can also be compared 
between responding and non-responding patients using a t-test or Mann-Whitney U-Test, if 
more appropriate. 
 
13.5 Reporting and Exclusions 
 
13.5.1   Evaluation of toxicity: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment with entinostat/  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475). 
 
13.5.2  Evaluation of response: All patients included in the study will be assessed for response 
to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete 
response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death 
from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other 
cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). [Note: By [CONTACT_640310], category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.] 
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those 
who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the 
response rate. Patients in response categories 4-[ADDRESS_856972] a treatment failure (disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. Precise 
definitions for categories 4-[ADDRESS_856973] been identified ( e.g., early death due to other reasons, early 
discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.). However, these sub- 
analyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment

 efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly 
reported. The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided. 
 
 
14. STUDY STATUS UPDATES AND STUDY CLOSURE 
 
14.1 Definitions of Study Status Changes 
 
14.1.1  Temporarily Closed to Accrual 
 
The study status is Temporarily Closed to Accrual when no patient slots are currently 
available, but there is the possibility that the trial will re-open for accrual (patient slots 
become available). Sites are not permitted to accrue additional patients until CTEP is 
notified of Re-Activation. 
 
Study status will need to be changed to Temporarily Closed to Accrual when any of the 
following criteria are met: 
 
 
x Sites are notified by [CONTACT_472] (via Request for Rapid Amendment [RRA]) of 
changes in the risk/benefit ratio that necessitate changes to the patient Informed 
Consent document. Requested changes will be specified in the RRA and must be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_1758]’s IRB. 
x CTEP and the lead investigator agree that unacceptable toxicities necessitate a 
discussion to change the dosing/regimen. 
x A protocol-defined benchmark has been achieved (such as an interim analysis 
before proceeding to the next stage). 
x Investigators encounter any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_131956] 5.3. 
 
14.1.2  Closed to Accrual 
 
The study status is (permanently) Closed to Accrual when no more patient enrollment 
slots are available, and at least one patient is still actively receiving the study treatment. 
Sites are no longer permitted to enroll additional patients. 
 
Patient slots are no longer available when the following criteria are met: 
 
x The pre-specified number of evaluable patients has been successfully enrolled, 
treated, and evaluated. 
x The study treatment has failed to meet the pre-specified efficacy goal at the stage 
1 interim analysis. 
x CTEP and the investigators agree that unacceptable toxicities preclude further 
enrollment. 
x Investigators encounter any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_131956] 5.3.

 14.1.3  Closed to Accrual and Treatment 
 
The study status is Closed to Accrual and Treatment when no more patient enrollment 
slots are available and no patients are c urrently receiving the study treatment. Patients 
may still be enrolled on the protocol only for the purposes of follow-up. 
 
Patient accrual and treatment will be permanently halted when any of the following 
criteria are met: 
 
x Enrollment was previously closed (study status of “Closed to Accrual”), and no 
patients are receiving the study trea tment. 
x CTEP and the investigators agree that unacceptable toxicities preclude further 
enrollment. In this case, CTEP and the investigators must collaborate to alter the 
regimen or to halt the study treatment altogether as soon as it can be safely done 
for patients currently receiving trea tment. 
 
CTEP and Theradex must be notified when patients are no longer receiving treatment 
[i.e., when the last patient(s) to be receiving treatment is/are no longer receiving the study 
regimen for any reason]. 
 
14.1.[ADDRESS_856974] not been removed from the study for other reasons. That is, there are no outstanding follow-up procedures to be 
performed as mandated by [CONTACT_760].

 APPENDIX D PROTOCOL FOR MONONUCLEAR CELLS ISOLATION 
(FICOLL HYPAQUE): 
 
1. Resuspend bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640269] (1:1) 
 
2. Gently layer the diluted suspension over 5 ml of F/H in a 15 ml conical tube. You can load up 
to 10 mL however limiting this to 9 ml or less reduced the chances of contact[CONTACT_640316]. 
 
3. Spin at 400g (1200rpm) for 30 minutes at Room Temp (22-24C). Do not set the brake on the 
centrifuge. 
 
4. Carefully remove the tube from the centrifuge. Using a glass pi[INVESTIGATOR_640270] (white) containing the MNC. This should take less than 2 ml per 15 ml conical (1 ml if 
you are careful not to disturb the layer). 
 
5. Transfer the cells to a fresh 15 ml conical tube and add PBS up to 10 ml (at least a 1:4 
dilution). Mix well then spin at 400g (1200rpm) for 10 minutes at Room Temp (22-24C). 
 
6. Carefully aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640271] 10 ml of PBS. Mix well then spin 
at 400g (1200rpm) for 10 minutes at Room Temp (22-24C). 
 
7. Carefully aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640271] 10 ml of PBS. Mix well then spin 
at 400g (1200rpm) for 10 minutes at Room Temp (22-24C). 
 
8. Resuspend the cell in a small volume of PBS or culture medium and count after mixing well. 
 
9. To cryopreserve the cells (minimum of 4 vials not to exceed 2x107/vial). 
 
a. The final concentration will usually be 40% Human Serum, 10% DMSO: 
1. The easiest method is to dilute the cells to a twice the final concentration in PBS and to 
add an equivalent volume of cells (500 ul) to a 2X freezing medium (80% Serum, 20% DMSO) 
prechilled to 4C. 
2. Transfer right away to a labeled cryovial and use a controlled rate device to drop the 
temperature to -80C prior to transfer to Liquid Nitrogen. The rate is usually ideal at -1C per minute for PBMC. 
 
Important considerations: 
 
1. All work should be done using standard BSL2 procedures (blood and body fluid precautions). 
2. Maintain a clean worksp ace and use a containment laminar airflow hood when possible. 
3. Minimize the chance of contamination. 
4. Work quickly but methodically. 
5. Keep tubes closed as much as possible and work quickly. 
6. Change gloves frequently and maintain situational awareness of contact [CONTACT_27922].

Information for Patients, Their Caregivers, and Non-Study Healthcare Team on Possible Interactions with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements 
 
The patient  is enrolled on a clinical trial using the 
experimental study drug, entinostat and Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) . This clinical trial is 
sponsored by [CONTACT_29630]. This form is addressed to the patient, but includes 
important information for others who care for this pa tient. 
 
These are the things that you as a healthcare provider need to know: 
 
x Entinostat was found to induce CYP 1A2, CYP 2C6, and CYP 2B8 as well as UGT 1A4. 
x Entinostat was found to be a substrate for P-gp and BCRP transporters, but did not inhibit 
either of these transport proteins. 
 
To the patient: Take this paper with you to your medical appointments and keep the attached information card in your wallet . 
 
Entinostat may interact with other drugs which can cause side effects. For this reason, it is very 
important to tell your study doctors of any medicines you are taking before you enroll onto this 
clinical trial. It is also very important to tell your doctors if you stop taking any regular 
medicines, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study. When you talk about your current medications with your doctors, include medicine you buy without a 
prescription (over-the-counter remedy), or any herbal supplements such as St. John’s Wort. It is 
helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated medication list with you. 
 
Many health care providers can write prescriptions. You must tell all of your health care providers (doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists) you are taking part in a 
clinical trial. 
 
These are the things that you and they need to know: 
 
Entinostat must be used very carefully with other medicines that use CYP 1A2, CYP 2C6, and 
CYP 2B8, UGT 1A4 and P-gp as well as BCRP transporters. Before you enroll onto the clinical 
trial, your study doctor will work with your regular health care providers to review any 
medicines and herbal supplements that are considered strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of 
CYP 1A2, CYP 2C6, and CYP 2B8 as well as UGT 1A4, and P-gp and BCRP transporters 
 
x Please be very careful! Over-the-counter drugs (including herbal supplements) may 
contain ingredients that could interact with your study drug. Speak to your doctors or 
pharmacist to determine if there could be any side effects. 
 
x Your regular health care provider should check a frequently updated medical reference or 
call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine or discontinuing any

 APPENDIX J CORRELATIVE STUDY PR OPOSAL 
 
BACKGROUND and RATIONALE: Besides allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the DNA 
methyltransferase inhibitor (DMNTi), azacitidine (AZA) is the only treatment proven to prolong survival in higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR- MDS). Nonetheless, HR-MDS patients 
treated with AZA have a median survival advantage of 9.5 months (24.5 vs 15 months median 
OS)
1 and the objective response rate is only 50% with most patients eventually relapsing within [ADDRESS_856995] that 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contribute to immune escape in some cancers63-65. 
MDSCs have been shown to exert a suppressive role against T cells in tumor microenvironment 
and lead to cancer progression in tumor-bearing mice models and cancer patients66. Murine 
MDSCs have been well defined by a combination of surface markers and its correlation with in 
vitro and in vivo suppressive functions49. However, much less has been reported on their human 
counterparts. An important recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation also demonstrated the importance of MDSCs which were significantly increased in bone marrows (BM) 
of MDS patients (~35% vs <5% in non-MDS BM controls) and played an important role in 
ineffective hematopoiesis in MDS
14. Thus, reprograming MDSCs to normal myeloid lineage cells 
may be important to prevent ineffective hematopoiesis and avoid immune escape. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_640274] c ells 
to MDSCs in cancers and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) prevent this pathologic differentiation
67. Another recent study demonstrated that MDSCs induce resistance to immune 
checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1) in colon cancer bearing mice15. Importantly,the 
MDSCs were decreased by [CONTACT_640286][INVESTIGATOR_640275], entinostat (ENT), leading to 
rejection of tumors when combined with immune chec kpoint blockade15. Thus, it will be important 
to investigate whether HDAC inhibitors can decrease the quantity of MDSCs and impact the c ourse 
of disease. 
As single agents, several HDACi were safe and well-tolerated but exhibited only modest clinical 
activities in patients with MDS4,5. Therefore, the interest to develop these agents further has 
focused on combination-based strategies, usually with DNMTi. To date, no HDACi- DNMTi 
combination has improved survival of MDS patients in randomized studies when used in the 
frontline or the post- DNMTi failure setti ng. These observations suggest that while HDACi therapy 
has activity in MDS, DNMTi might not be the best choice for combination-based regimen with HDACi. Exploration of alternative agents to combine with HDACi in the post-DNMTi failure 
setting might be a more rational approach. 
Another important mechanism which cancers employ commonly to evade the immune system involve the exploitation of T-cell inhibitory pathways involving inhibitory molecules such as the 
programed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4)
6,7. Immune 
checkpoint blockade with antibodies directed against PD-1, its ligand (PD-L1), and CTLA-4 has emerged as a novel promising approach to reverse immune evasion, and has resu lted in a 
significant and durable clinical activity in some patients with advanced solid malignancies

                Version Date: 09/04/[ADDRESS_856996] that interaction between PD-1 and 
PD-L1 may induce immune evasion in MDS
12 and moreover the upregulation of these molecules 
could be associated with resistance to DNMTi therapy in MDS13. 
 
HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that the HDACi ENT can reduce the quantity and suppressive 
function of MDSCs in BM of MDS patients who fail to get responses from DNMTi. We also 
hypothesize that ENT with have a synergistic effect with the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab 
leading to meaningful clinical res ponses when used in combination. The objective of this proposal 
is to assess the in vivo effects of the combined therapy with PD1 blockade and HDACi on three 
exploratory immunologic endpoints through correlative and mechanistic studies of samples collected from BM of treated patients. 
 
SPECIFIC AIMS : 
 
Aim 1. Assess the dynamic changes in MDSCs (quantitative and qualitative) in relation to 
ENT/anti-PD1 combined therapy and its correlation with the clinical res ponse. 
 
Aim 2. Evaluate PD-L1 expression in CD34+ blasts from human MDS BM and its c orrelation with 
the response to anti-PD1 therapy. 
 
Aim 3. Characterize functional dynamics of immune cell subsets in MDS BM following ENT and 
anti-PD1 treatment. 
 
Successful completion of these studies will describe the pembrolizumab-induced reprogramming 
in T-cell populations, assess whether these changes correlate with clinical events, provide critical 
insights into the future wider use of PD-1 blockade-based immunotherapy in patients with MDS 
and other myeloid malignancies, and demonstrate the significance of targeting MDSCs via 
HDACi. 
 
PRELIMINARY DATA/PRIOR STUDIES: The role of MDSCs in MDS and the preclinical data of HDACi to suppress MDSCs: Myelopoiesis is altered in cancer including the expansion of a subset of relatively immature and 
activated myeloid cells, now called MDSCs
48. MDSCs have been reported to facilitate tumor 
metastasis and angiogenesis49-51. Recently, MDSCs were found to be significantly expanded in 
BM of patients with MDS and to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease 
especially in driving ineffective hemat opoiesis14. The role of MDSCs in pat hogenesis of MDS and 
the optimal strategy to target MDSCs remain under investigation. Kim and colleagues recently demonstrated that MDSCs can mediate resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in a 
murine tumor model
15. In this study, treatment with anti-PD-[ADDRESS_856997] 
cancers15. Interestingly, when the animals were co-treated with epi[INVESTIGATOR_640230] (i.e. 
ENT+AZA or ENT alone) in addition to the anti bodies, the outcomes improved significantly with 
cure rates in excess of 80% of the tumor-bearing mice15. Importantly, AZA and ENT (alone or

findings suggested that the combination of the class [ADDRESS_856998]- ENT/anti-PD1 therapy to achieve our primary goal of this study in specific aim 1 . 
PD-L1 expression in MDS and its correlation with the response to anti-PD1 therapy: Kondo 
et al. demonstrated that PD-L1-positive MDS blasts have an intrinsic proliferative advantage and 
induce T-cell suppression through interactions with PD-1 receptors potentially contributing to 
disease progression
12. They also showed in BM samples, blasts from HR-MDS patients expressed 
PD-L1 molecules more often compared with those from LR- MDS patients while the BM T-cells 
over-expressed PD-1 molecules12. The MD Anderson group studied mRNA in CD34+ cells from 
124 patients with MDS, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia 
(CMML) and found that 34%, 15%, and 8% had aberrant up-regulation ( စ2-fold) in PD-L1, PD- 
1 and CTLA4, respectively13. PD-L1 protein expression was observed in MDS CD34+ cells, 
whereas stromal and non-blast cellular elements were positive for PD-1. More importantly, in a subgroup of patients treated with DNMTi therapy, PD-L1, PD-[ADDRESS_856999] the 
PD-1/PD-L1 axis might mediate resistance to DNMTi therapy and provide rationale for using 
immune checkpoint blockade with an anti-PD1 antibody as a novel therapeutic approach to improve outcomes of HR-MDS patients. However, preliminary results from ongoing early phase clinical trials of ant-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents in MDS patients s uggest that immune 
checkpoint therapy as a monotherapy only leads to disease stabilization in some patients but very 
few responses
68. This observation provides rationale for combining immune checkpoint therapy 
with other novel agents with distinct mechanisms of action to improve patient outcomes. Additionally, there is no single biomarker to predict the response to anti-PD1 therapy in cancers. Previous data indicate that the response rate of anti-PD-[ADDRESS_857000] the question about the expression of PD-L1 in CD34+ blasts from human

memory T-cell compar tments69. For instance, we simply divide T-cells into four subsets: naïve

 (CD45RA+CCR7+), central memory (CD45RA-CCR7+), effector memory (CD45RA-CCR7-), 
late effector (CD45RA+CCR7-)69. The ratio of T CM (CD45RA-CCR7+) to T EMRA 
(CD45RA+CCR7-) and of T EM (CD45RA-CCR7-) to T EMRA (CD45RA+CCR7-) will be assessed  
in BM and peripheral blood using flow cytometry. More recent preclinical data suggest that the 
frequency of CD8+, and CD8+/regulatory T cells (Tregs) are two important predictive markers for 
anti-PD1 therapy70. Additionally, this st udy also demonstrated exhausted CD8+ T cells defined by 
[CONTACT_640318]-[ADDRESS_857002] the response to anti-PD1 therapy in MDS. 
 
METHODOLOGY OF CORRELATIVE STUDIES (EXPLORATORY BIOMARKERS): 
Specific Aim 1. Determine the numeric and functional alterations of MDSCs in relation to 
ENT/anti-PD1 therapy and their correlations with the clinical response 
Human MDSCs are defined by a cross-sectional assessment of well-known surface markers with 
functional phenotype. Initially, the expression of a common myeloid marker, CD33 without the 
expression of the lymphoid cell markers (CD3, CD19, CD56) defined human MDSCs63. 
Subsequent studies classified human MDSCs by [CONTACT_44688]-DR-/Lineage-71, HLA-DR-/Lineage- 
/CD33[PHONE_13312], HLA-DR-/Lineage-/CD33+/CD11b+65, CD14-/CD15+/CD33+/CD11b+75, or HLA- 
DR-/CD1476-80. These heterogeneous definitions of human MDSCs cause a fundamental caveat 
especially in human correlative studies, s uggesting that the most clinically relevant markers s hould 
be determined. Moreover, sample processing such as cryopreservation has been reported to affect 
some expression of surface markers and the suppressive function of human MDSCs81. Thus fresh 
BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640276]. Historically, human BM core biopsy has been decalcified for immunohistochemistry (IHC). This 
additional manipulation may also affect the expression of surface markers of MDSCs. Thus, we 
will use surface markers that are relatively resistant to cryopreservation
81 in formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded clot sections to avoid decalcification step to perform multiplex quantitative 
immunofluorescence (multiplex-QIF) while maintaining the immune architecture. We will also 
compare IHC/IF findings and its quantitative analyses by [CONTACT_640319] 
(AQUA) (described below) with flow cytometric data in BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. T hese procedures will be 
performed with a strong collaboration with Mina Xu at the Hematology tissue bank/[CONTACT_640336]’s lab (Yale and at [CONTACT_640334] laboratory at Vanderbilt University (Kim Lab).. 
We acknowledge the lack of understanding the baseline AQUA value of MDSCs in treatment naïve 
MDS patients, inter-patient or intra-patient variability of MDSCs at this time. While our study will 
provide important data, are collecting BM cells from treatment-naïve MDS patients (regardless of 
participation in the study) to show interpatient consistency of our biomarker the baseline value of 
MDSCs using QIF and flow cytometry. We will also use BM cells from one particular healthy donor as an inter-assay variability control. Intra-patient variability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_640320]ïve- MDS patients (before 
starting any treatment except transfusion) 
SA 1.1. Assess the quan titative change of MDSCs in BM of MDS p atients in res ponse to EN T/anti- 
PD1 treatment. 
Human MDSCs, defined as CD 11b+/Lineage-ve (CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD56)/HLA- 
DR-/CD33+ cells as in the prior landmark publication,14 will be enumerated in fresh BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640277]. All flow cytometric acquisition will be carried out using an

 LSR II (BD) or FACS Calibur (BD) and acquired data will be analyzed using FlowJo software 
(TreeStar). 
In addition, formalin-fixed paraffin-embed clot sections of BM clot sections will be investigated 
by [CONTACT_640321] (AQUA) as previously described 82. Briefly, 
AQUA® is a method to objectively and accurately measure biomarker expression within defined 
areas of interest and subcellular compartments based on co-localization with other biomarkers 
and DAPI ( 4',6-diamidino -2-phenylindole) . Pi[INVESTIGATOR_640278] a continuous scoring system directly proportional to the concentration of the biomarker of interest. Multiplexing different markers of immune cells and immune checkpoints allows identification 
and characterization of various cell types involved in immune response and in development of 
resistance to specific therapeutic approaches. Assays for multiplexing up to [ADDRESS_857003] been described previously

SA 1.2. Assess the spatial relationship between MDSCs and cell subsets in MDS BM 
Following the efforts of identification and quantification of MDSCs serial clot sections will be 
stained for CD11b, for CD34 and E-Cadherin in order to investigate the spatial relationships of 
MDSCs with myeloblasts and pro-erythroblasts. Further subclassification of MDSCs can be 
performed using the biomarkers CD14 and CD15 for differentiation of monocytic and granulocytic MDSCs, respectively. 
Further characterization of T cell subsets will be performed if sufficient tissue is available. The 
immune cell panel of CD3/CD4/CD8 will be analyzed as well as PD-1 and FOXP3 levels will be 
measured. 
In addition to protein quantification using the AQUA method of QIF, the slides will also be scanned on the Vectra platform, which is an automated quantitative pathology imaging system to be used with immunofluorescent or immunohistochemical stains. The Inform Software facilitates 
cell counting and characterization as opposed to the QIF AQUA system where scoring is based on 
measurement of protein concentration.

 SA 1.3. Assess the change of functional characteristics of MDSCs in BM of MDS patients in 
response to ENT/anti-PD1 trea tment 
The depletion of L-arginine inhibits T-cell proliferation through decreasing the expression of &'ȗ
chain52 and down-regulating the expression of cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase [ADDRESS_857005] of T cells in G0-G1 of the cell cycle. The increased activity of arginase in MDSCs leads to enhanced L-arginine catabolism, which depletes L-arginine in tumor microenvironment. Now the assay to measure arginase activity is one of the classic methods to assess the function of MDSCs. Therefore, intracellular expression of arginase I in MDSCs of MDS patients will be assessed by [CONTACT_7163]-color flow cytometry using s urface markers to define MDSCs following fixation 
and permeabilization compared
87,88. 
We will also measure arginase activity of MDSCs in MDS patients. Briefly, sorted MDSCs from BM of MDS patients (sorted by [CONTACT_7811]) will be lysed and the enzyme will be activated by [CONTACT_333600] 10 mins at 56’C. Arginine hydrolysis w ill be c onducted by [CONTACT_640322] 100 μl of 
0.5M L-arginine at 37’C for 2 hrs. Urea concentration w ill be measured at 540nm after addition of 
ORIĮ -isonitrosopropi[INVESTIGATOR_640279], followed by [CONTACT_223431] 95’C for 30mins. 
The ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been reported to be one of the major mechanisms of MDSC-i nduced immune suppression in cancer patients
89. Thus, we will use the 
ROS production following stimulation as a surrogate functional marker for MDSCs81. Briefly, 
MDS BM cells will be incubated at 37 qC in medium in the presence of 10 PM oxidation-sensitive 
dye, dichlororodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) (Molecular Probes, CA) for 15 min. Cells 
will be stimulated by 50ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and [ADDRESS_857006] the arginase I expression, the arginase activity and ROS generation of MDSCs to diminish following ENT treatment. 
SA 1.4. Evaluate the alteration of the suppressive function of MDSCs from BM of MDS patients 
following ENT/anti-PD1 treatment 
Functional properties of MDSC include suppression of antigen-s timulated T cell proliferation and 
IFN-Ȗ production51. To determine the functional alteration of MDSCs after EN T/anti-PD1 therapy, 
we will perform T-cell proliferation assay using thymidine incorporation and ELISA for IFN- Ȗ
detection. For T-cell suppression assay, MDSCs will be sorted from BM of MDS patients by 
[CONTACT_117159]-activated cell sorting (FACS). T-cells w ill be isolated by [CONTACT_150969]-activated cell 
sorting (MACS) using CD3 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) from autologous peripheral blood. T- 
cells (2x104) will be plated in 96-well flat bottom plates in triplicate in RPMI medium 
supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum. T-cells will be stimulated with IL-2 and anti- CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads (Invitrogen) at a 1:2 ratio of T cells to beads. MDSCs will beadded 
with T-cell cultures at ratios of 1:4. After 3 days of co-culture, supernatants will be harvested to

cell function to diminish following ENT treatment. 
Potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_292723] (SA1): The quantity of MDSCs in BM samples is hard to predict. In addition to 
QIF, we will also pe rform flow cyto metric analyses using the same markers (CD 11b, CD33, HLA-

/CD15+) and monocytic MDSCs (CD11b+/CD33+/HLA-DR-/CD14+) in fresh aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640280]. 
 
We will prioritize patient BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640281] e nough to perform all of the assays described 
in SA1. Our first priority will be to measure the quantitative alteration of MDSCs pre- and post- 
anti-PD1 therapy/ENT by [CONTACT_4133]. We will measure the expression of arginase I, the generation of ROS (SA 1.3). We w ill then assess the arginase activity (SA 1.3) and the suppression 
assay (SA 1.4), and lastly measure arginase activity. Cryopreservation, decalcific ation and the type 
of collection tubes (heparin vs EDTA vs calcium phosphate) may affect the quantity or quality of 
MDSCs
81,90. We will stain fresh cells for flow cytometry and functional assay and clot section of 
BM for QIF assay81. We will also use EDTA tubes as described before if we see any significant 
difference of the quantity or quality of MDSCs depending on the types of tube90. 
 
Specific Aim 2. Evaluate whether PD-L1 expression in CD34+ blasts from MDS BM correlates with the response to anti-PD1 therapy: Clot sections of BM will be fixed. PD-L1 
expression w ill be evaluated on MDS CD34+ blasts by [CONTACT_640324]. Specimens w ill be classified 
as negative or positive if <5%,  of CD34+ cells are PD-L1 positive, respectively as previously 
described
8,10,13. Flow cytometry will be carried out on the BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640282]-L1 expressing CD34+ blasts in BM of MDS patients using rabbit anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (E1L3N, Cell Signaling). Specimens w ill be classified as FACS negative or positive if 
RI&'DUH3' -L1 positive, respectively. These studies will be performed at the 
beginning of trial and after the first cycle of ENT monotherapy, after every [ADDRESS_857009]- anti-PD1 therapy: Using multi-color flow cytomet ry, we will examine CD4+, 
CD8
+ T-cell subpopulations (expressing CD45RA, CCR7, and CD27), Foxp3+ regulatory T cells 
(T-regs), and also natural killer (NK), NKT cells and de ndritic cells (DC) with the following panel 
of mAbs: CD16 and CD56 (markers of NK cells and NKT cells), CD11c (a marker of myeloid 
DCs) and CD123 (a marker of plasmacytoid DCs) in BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_640283] (pre- and post- anti-PD1). We will also analyze PD-1 expression and 
intracellular molecules such as F oxp3, Ki67, Eomes and Granzyme B (GzmB). All flow cyto metric 
acquisition will be carried out using an LSR II (BD) or FACS Cali bur (BD) and acquired data will 
be analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). The changes in these subsets w ill be correlated with 
clinical responses. 
 
Potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_640284] (for SA2 & SA3): We will possibly have limited 
number of cells in BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], so we will prioritize patient samples if not enough to perform all the assays described in SA2, SA3. Our priority will be to ca rry out SA3 since SA2 w ill be assessed 
by [CONTACT_4658]. Alternatively, we will analyze the immune profile combining a high-throughput technique 
that will allow us to study more than 20 markers in a single cell analysis using mass cytometry 
(CyTOF). These techniques will provide information about the architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) (i.e. BM) and the distribution of markers of interest detected with 
CyTOF. CyTOF-based single cell analysis is a new technology that combines flow cytometry with 
metal-conjugated anti bodies detected by [CONTACT_640325] 
(up to 100 molecules) on a single cell analysis
91. For this assay, the staining will be pe rformed

 using MaxPar Human T Cell Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_640285] (CD11a, CD4, CD8a, CD16, CD25, CD45, 
CCR7, CD69, CD45RO, CD44, CD27, CD45RA, CD3, CD57, HLA-DR, and CD127) along with 
CD28, CD117, and CD95), modified MaxPar human AML phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_4395] (added 
CD10,CD13, CD16 on top of CD19, CD117, CD11b, CD64, CD7, CD123, CD45, CD33, CD15, CD34, CD3, CD44, CD38, HLA-DR, CXCR4) for surface s taining as per ma nufacturer’s protocol. 
Additionally, after fixation and permeabilization, cells will be stained with anti-human Ki-67- 
151Eu (B56; BD Pharmingen Ab conjugated with lanthanide MaxPar Europi[INVESTIGATOR_390585] 151Eu 
using the MaxPar X8 Ab labeling kit) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells will be acquired on 
CyTOF 2 instrument (DVS; Fluidigm Sciences). All data will be analyzed and graphs generated using the DVS Cytobank software (Cytobank). 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS and ANALYTICAL PLAN 
SPECIFIC AIM 1: 
The quantitative change in MDSCs (% MDSCs by [CONTACT_4133], QIF score by [CONTACT_485200]) during 
treatment with the ENT/anti-PD1 combined therapy will be estimated using mixed effects models 
to take into account the within-patient correlation of measurements over time. Likelihood ratio 
tests will be pe rformed to confirm if random intercepts and slopes are n ecessary in the model. The 
fixed effect for change in MDSCs over time will be evaluated for significance. The variability in the rate of change in MDSCs across patients will also be examined. The association between the 
clinical outcome and a meaningful reduction in MDSCs, which will be defined after a review of 
the data, will be assessed with the chi-square test. The quantity of MDSCs at baseline and during 
treatment as continuous variables can also be compared between responding and non-responding 
patients using a t-test or Mann-Whitney U-Test, if more appropriate. We will apply the same statistical analyses for the expression of arginase I and ROS and arginase activity of MDSCs (SA 
1.3) and suppressive activity of MDSCs by [CONTACT_35755] T-cell proliferation & IFN- Ȗ production (SA 
1.4). 
SPECIFIC AIM 2: MDACC study demonstrated 20% of leukemic blasts express PD-L1 when 
positive is considered when more than 5% CD34+ blasts express PD-L1 by [CONTACT_640326]34+ controls, PD-L1 is nearly 0%13. An association of clinical response with the expression of 
PD-L1 MDS CD34+ blasts will be assessed by a Pearson chi-square test on a 2x2 table of 
frequencies. The dependent variable will be defined as response (yes versus no), and flow 
cytometry/IHC categories (negative vs positive) will be the independent variables. We will also monitor the dynamic change of PD-L1 expression over the course of treatment and its correlation with clinical response. Longitudinal measurements of PD-L1 will be examined using mixed- 
effects modeling. 
SPECIFIC AIM 3: Statistical analyses of the frequency of CD8+, CD4+, Foxp3 Tregs, 
CD8+/Foxp3+ Tregs, T CM/TEMRA, TEM/TEMRA, the percentage of Ki67 and GzmB in PD-1+, 
Eomes+ CD8 T cells to compare changes over time from baseline to several time-points w ill be 
performed by [CONTACT_640327] a Benjamini-Hochberg correction to control for 
false discovery rates.

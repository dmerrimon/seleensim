  V14.0, 02/02/[ADDRESS_1130226] subthreshold vibrotactile stimulation durin g therapy compared with t he control group who will 
wear the device with no vibrati on (placebo), and that this bett er improvement in hand function is associated with 
neurophysiologic measures of centra l nervous system responsiven ess.  
 B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE_________________________________ ________________________ 
 
Stroke survivors suffer from persistent hand impairment that di minishes their functi onal abilities and 
independence, despi[INVESTIGATOR_816320]. Senso ry stimulation can prime central excitability to 
increase therapy outcome. Unlike existing methods including tra nscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, 
muscle/tendon vibration, and repe titive transcranial magnetic s timulation (TMS) that require prior exposure to the 
sensory stimulation as long as [ADDRESS_1130227], knowledge about the l ong-term efficacy of this 
new sensory stimulation technique and its underlying mechanism is limited. This limitati on presents an obstruction 
to clinical adoption and optimization for efficacy.  
 C. PRELIMINARY STUDIES_____ ____________________________________ __________________________ 
 
The PI’s preliminary studies sh owed that hand motor scores imme diately improved with remote subthreshold 
(unperceivable) vibrotactile sti mulation. Stroke survivors comp leted the Nine-Hole P eg and Box and Block tests 
faster with subthreshold (60% o f the sensory threshold) vibrota ctile stimulation applied to the wrist (p<.05) (Seo et 
al. 2014). The stimulation was gen erated by [CONTACT_816326] (EAI, Cassel berry, FL) placed on the skin using tape. Learning 
effects were controlled by [CONTACT_816327]-randomizing the stimulation off and on.  Improvement in hand 
motor function with the stimulat ion was seen not only in stroke  survivors but also in heal thy adults (Hur et al. 
2014).   
Preliminary studies also showed  that tactile sensation improved  with the stimulation. Instantaneously with the 
stimulation, stroke survivors could detec t smaller Semmes-Weins tein monofilaments on the fingertips, indicating 
improved touch sensation (p<.01) (Enders et al. 2013). 
 
D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHO DS ____________ ___________ _________ ________________________ 
 
The hypotheses will be tested in a  double-blind stratified rand omized controlled trial. Experimental and control 
groups will be compared for post-therapy changes in hand functi on. To obtain two comparable groups, stroke 
subjects will be stratified by t heir initial hand motor and sen sory scores (Fugl-Meyer and Semmes-Weinstein mild 
vs. moderate). Subjects will be rand omly and blindly assigned t o either the experimental  or the control group. A 
standardized task-practice ther apy focused on dexterous object manipulation and multi-joint upper extremity 
coordination will be used, since t he intervention targets senso ry feedback-based motor control. The research 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816321]. Each subject will receive therapy  two hours/day,  3 days/week for 2 weeks. T he duration of 2 weeks 
is deemed sufficient to result in statistically greater improve ment in motor outcome and cortical reorganization 
(seen using fMRI/TMS) for the experimental compared to the cont rol group. The two groups  will receive therapy of 
equal intensity individually in the same room supervised by [CONTACT_816328][INVESTIGATOR_816322]-sized device providing the light vib ration works. Tactor (EAI, Casselberry, FL) 
generating light vibration in our preliminary studies will be a pplied to the wrist. At the beginning of each therapy 
session, the subject’s sensory  threshold will be determined and  the vibrating intensity will be adjusted to either 
60% of the sensory threshold or zero, depending on the group. B linding to the light vibration stimulation is 
possible because subjects cannot perceive subthreshold (imperce ptible) vibration, thus t hey do not know whether 
they are receiving the vibration or not. 
  V14.0, 02/02/2017 3 of  8 
 
Evaluation will be performed befor e (pre-intervention testing),  after (post-intervention testing), and 2 weeks after 
the therapy (follow up testing) . Clinical sensorimotor function  of the hand will be assessed using clinical tests, 
such as the Nine Hole Peg, Acti on Research Arm, Box and Block t est to assess dexterity, as well as the 
Semmes-Weinstein and Grating Orie ntation tests to assess sensat ion. Secondarily, the Stroke Impact Scale and 
Stroke-Specific Quality of Lif e Scale will be recorded to asses s the potential for the light vibration stimulation to 
impact patients’ self-care abilit ies. Neurophysiologic evaluati on will be performed using the MRI including an 
anatomical scan, diffusional kur tosis imaging (DKI), and functi onal MRI (fMRI) during grip, TMS including resting 
and active motor thresholds and mo tor evoked potential peak-to- peak amplitudes (all o f these variables are 
routinely used in MUSC TMS evaluation protocols), and EEG evoke d potentials and frequency power modulation 
during grip.  
 
Each subject will visit MUSC for a  total of [ADDRESS_1130228]-treatment eva luation will include clinical h and function assessment, MRI, TMS, and EEG after 
the completion of therapy. Follow up testing will include clini cal hand function, TMS, and EEG again 2 weeks after 
the completion of therapy. Each set of evaluations (pre, post, and follow up testing) can be performed over 2 days 
to minimize participant fatigue.  
 Subjects will be paid $[ADDRESS_1130229]-testing, the par ticipant will receive $25 
for each type of evaluation completed (i.e., clinical hand func tion, MRI, TMS, and EEG) fo r a total of $100. For 
follow-up evaluations, the partici pant will receive $33 for cli nical hand function, $33 for TMS, and $34 EEG for a 
total of $100.  The participan t will receive $25 per therapy vi sit for participation in this s tudy.  There will be a total 
of 11 evaluations se ssions and 6 therapy v isits. If they comple te all evaluations and t herapy visits, they will 
receive a total of $450. If they stop participating in the stud y, they can keep the paym ent they have already 
received, but will not receive any more compensation. If the su bject does not complete one of the assessments 
due to scheduling conflicts or safe ty risks (see Section 2.b.),  the subject will not receive  remuneration for that 
portion of the study. The paymen t will be in cash, at the end o f each visit.   
 
Analysis: Repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc comparisons will be used to determine if each clinical hand 
function score improves more fo r the experimental compared with  the control group. A significant interaction 
between time (pre, p ost, 2 weeks after) and group (experimental /control) will support the hypothesis. Pearson’s 
correlations between the mean c hange in clinical hand function scores and each of the neurophysiologic 
measures will be examined to ident ify relevant neurophysiologic  measures for hand function. 
 
Expected Outcomes: Greater recovery of dexterous hand function is expected with th e light vibration stimulation 
(with a significant session×group interaction). This exciting f inding will be the first to demonstrate that this 
unperceivable vibration stimulat ion at the wrist improves hand therapy outcomes.  
  E. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJ ECTS________________________________ ________________________ 
 
1.  RISKS TO THE SUBJECTS  
 
a.  Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics  
1. The subject will complete safet y screening in cluding presenc e of any metal in the body, history of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and concussion.  
2. The level of hand and arm move ment as well as fingers’ touch  sensation will be asse ssed. For movement 
assessment, the subject will be asked to move the hand and arm in specific ways as best as one can and 
move objects in different sizes and shapes around the table wit h the hand as quickly as possible. For 
sensation assessment, the subjec t will be asked i f s/he can fee l a small touch on fingertips.  
3. If the subject is eligible fo r the study, the subject will b e randomly assigned to o ne of two groups. This 
means that the subject has a 50/50 chance (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin ) of being in either group. Neither the 
researchers nor the subject will make the choice of which group  to which the subject is assigned. The two 
groups are Group A (unperceivable wrist vibration group) and Gr oup B (placebo, no wrist vibration group).  
4. For both groups, we will as k the subject about the stroke ty pe (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and location as 
much as the subject knows.  
  V14.0, 02/02/2017 4 of  8 
5. For both groups, we will perf orm four types of evaluations t o measure recovery. The assessment of the 
hand/arm movement ability and finger sensation will serve as ev aluation #1 (clinical hand function). 
Evaluation #[ADDRESS_1130230] will hav e a Magnetic Resonance Imag ing (MRI) exam (evaluation #2). This MRI 
exam includes an anatomical sca n to specify the area of the bra in that we will stimulate using transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (TMS) for t he next evaluation, DKI that pr ovides information about the architecture 
within the cortex relevant to rev ealing lesion-specific impairm ent, and fMRI to exami ne brain networks 
used during hand grip. For the MRI exam, the subject will lie d own on a narrow bed which will then be 
placed in a tunnel that is [ADDRESS_1130231] may feel warm 
during this procedure. Evaluati on #2 will take approximately an  hour.  
7. Next, excitability of neurons in the brain will be assessed using TMS (evaluation #3, TMS). TMS is a 
noninvasive brain stimulation dev ice. We will help the subject put an elastic cap onto the head. This cap 
is like a swimmers c ap. The subject will be asked to sit in a c ushioned chair and asked to be at rest or 
hold a light grip while the brain receives stimulation. A TMS p ad will be held above the head. The tester 
will trigger a switch on the TMS paddle which will deliver a ma gnetic pulse to the out side of the skull. The 
subject will hear a clicking sou nd when the paddle produces its  magnetic energy and the subject might 
feel a light tap against the scal p. The magnetic pulse stimulat es the brain nerves c ontrolling the hand. 
Therefore the subject may or may not feel the hand muscle brief ly twitch depending on  the strength of the 
TMS pulse. The subject might also  feel the facial muscles twitc h slightly just around the eye.  This twitch 
is a result of the TMS directly s timulating the facial nerves a nd muscles that run directly under the scalp. 
The TMS pad may be moved around  the head until the best positio n is located to give a contraction of the 
hand muscle. This contraction w ill be measured by a muscle acti vity sensor that will be placed on the 
hand skin with a sticky pad and/or  tape. Evaluation #[ADDRESS_1130232] 
or pi[INVESTIGATOR_816323] a light force (as in  holding a pen) upon cues, whil e brain activity is recorded using the 
electrodes of electroencephalog ram, EEG (evaluation #4, EEG). E valuation #4 may take two hours. 
9. After completing all evaluati ons, both groups will receive u pper limb therapy 3 times a week for 2 
consecutive weeks (for a total o f 6 sessions) while wearing a v ibrator at the wrist. An off-the-shelf 
mechanical vibrator in the size  of a dime will be used. During therapy, Group A will re ceive vibration at the 
wrist at the level that is imper ceptible. Group B will receive placebo, also in zero vibration at the wrist, 
during therapy. Both groups will not feel any vibration at the wrist during therapy, because the vibration is 
either very small or none. The therapy will focus on object man ipulation, dexterous hand movement, and 
coordinated hand and arm movements.  
10. After the last therapy sessi on, all four evaluations (hand clinical function, MRI, TMS, and EEG) will be 
performed again.  
11. Two weeks after the last th erapy session, the subject will come to MUSC again to go through the three 
evaluations again (hand clinical function, TMS, and EEG).  
Thirty chronic stroke survivors  will be recruited (with 15 in e ach of the control and ex perimental groups). The age 
range will be 21 and older.   
The inclusion criteria are mild to moderate impairment in upper  extremity function (approximately 30 to 60 on the 
Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity withou t the reflex portion). Exclusi on criteria are cognitive dysfunction as evidenced 
by [CONTACT_816329]-step instructions and/or provide c onsent to participate in the study, stroke<3 months (to 
avoid interference with acute c are), treatment with botox in th e affected arm within 3 m onths of start of study, and 
age <21. Individuals with MRI contr aindications (e.g., metal in  the body, claustrophia, pregnancy) or TMS 
contraindications (e.g., history  of seizure, concussion, pregna ncy) may still be consider ed for the study, but will 
not complete the contraindicat ed evaluation.  Inclusion is base d on clinical assessment, b ecause recovery relates 
most with initial impairment lev el, not lesion characteristics.

c.  Potential Risks  
 
1. There is a slight risk for loss of confidentiality although researchers will take appro priate steps to protect 
any information collected about the subjects. 
 
2. Randomization: The treatment one person receives may prove t o be less effective or to have more side 
effects than the other study treatment. 
 
3. Imperceptible vibration: For  people in the group that receiv es vibration at the wrist, prolonged vibration 
may numb although it is very unlik ely because the vibration app lied is very small to the extent that it is 
imperceptible.  
 
4. TMS: TMS could move iron-containing objects in or around the  face or head, which could in the process 
possibly harm the person. There is  a slight risk of a seizure w ith TMS. There is a very low risk of scalp 
discomfort and headaches. A TMS s timulus may feel like a slight  tap to the skull. There may be 
discomfort from the muscle cont raction that occurs in the hand muscle in response to the TMS. There is a 
very low risk of hearing loss due to the clicking sounds that t he TMS machine makes. Safety of TMS in 
pregnancy is unknown. The use of tape or other adhesives to sec ure EMG sensors during testing may 
cause some mild skin irritation. 
 
5. MRI: MRI could move iron-cont aining objects in the MRI room,  which could in the process possibly harm 
the person. There is discomfort b y claustrophobia and by [CONTACT_816331]. Temporary hearing loss 
has been reported from the loud noi se. The person may feel unco mfortable as s/he will be asked not to 
swallow for a while.  
6. EEG: It may be uncomfortable  to wear a head cap attached wit h a bundle of wires during evaluation. 
Also, the gel used for the el ectrodes will get hair messy.

7. Unknown Risks: The experiment al treatments may have unknown side effects.  
 
 
2.  ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS  
 
a.  Recruitment and  Informed Consent 
 Stroke survivors will be recruit ed from the MUSC stroke researc h registry database (approved MUSC IRB 
PRO#[ZIP_CODE], Kautz PI) at the MUSC  College of Health Professions Center for Rehabilitation Research in 
Neurological Conditions. The dat abase currently contains contac t information for ~[ADDRESS_1130234] signed informed consent to be contact[CONTACT_33632]. In a ddition, the SC Research Directory will be used 
for recruitment.  
 
Recruitment 
This study will recruit from the Registry for Stroke Recovery ( RESTORE-Pro#00037803), which is a registry with 
subjects consented for future  contact. RESTORE staff will query  the registry for potential subjects and provide the 
Principal Investigator (PI) with the contact [CONTACT_816332].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_816324] s creen for potent ial enrollment .  
 Sharing Data 
If the subject agrees, the data  collected and generated from th is study will be shared to t he Registry for Stroke 
Recovery (RESTORE-Pro#00037803) b y the subject’s registry ID. S haring data from this stu dy with the registry 
will allow for more targeted rec ruitment efforts in the future and allow researchers at MUSC to have a more 
complete registry with  key stroke recovery elements including c ommon data and physical f unction characteristics 
that are applicable to multiple studies. MUSC researchers and c ollaborating facilities will be able to query data 
sets to learn more about recovery of subjects after their strok e through institutionally mana ged secure servers that 
will assure HIPAA privacy and security compliance. 
 
The consent process will take pla ce when the potential particip ant comes to the laboratory on a scheduled time 
agreed upon between the study coo rdinator and the participant. The content of the consent will be verbally 
explained to the subject and the subject will be asked to raise  any questions and conc erns. If the perso n requests 
a waiting period, then one will be given. If the person desires  to consent immediately, t hen the person will provide 
consent immediately. 
 
b.  Protection against Risk 
 
1. Loss of confidentiality:  App ropriate steps will be taken to  protect any information collected.  The 
data from test results will be de-identified once it has been c ollected and before it is stored.  This means 
individual results would not be able to be linked to the subjec t by [CONTACT_816333]. The linkage between subject codes and identities as w ell as all other identifiable information 
including consent/HIPPA forms w ill be stored in a locked room a nd be accessible only to the study 
personnel.   
2. TMS: The MUSC Brain Stim Laboratory requires that all subjec ts receiving TMS and MRI 
complete a screening questionn aire to ensure that the person do es not have any loose metal objects like 
earrings or nose rings or a pie ce of metal in the body such as a fragment in the eye, aneurysm clips, ear 
implants, spi[INVESTIGATOR_816325], a pacemaker, or an implant electrical device. A person must be 
screened before each TMS and/or M RI exam. Persons who do not me et the screening criteria for TMS or 
MRI may still be considered elig ible for the study, but will no t complete these evaluations.   
 
The primary safety concern with T MS is the induction of seizure s; however, the incidence of seizures is 
very low and mostly associated with high frequency repetitive T MS (rTMS) which will not be used in this 
project. Instead we will use single- pulse TMS, which is much sa fer and we will follow published “gold 
standard” safety guidelines for diagnostic TMS to minimize the risk of inducing a seizure (Groppa et al. 
2012) .  
 
  V14.0, 02/02/[ADDRESS_1130235] will be asked to  notify the experimenter if s/he experi ences these. The headache or changes in 
cognitive function is expressed , the subject will stop particip ating in the study. 
 Persons with potential for pregn ancy will not have the TMS stim ulation. Persons with a history of seizures 
will not have the TMS stimulation. 
 
For mild skin irritation related to the use of tape or other ad hesives to secure EMG sensors during testing, 
the subject will be advised to cle an the adhesive residue with either alcohol swab provided or soap and 
water after the experiment.  
 
5. MRI: The MUSC Brain Stim Labo ratory requires that all subjec ts receiving TMS and MRI 
complete a screening questionn aire to ensure that the person do es not have any loose metal objects like 
earrings or nose rings or a pie ce of metal in the body such as a fragment in the eye, aneurysm clips, ear 
implants, spi[INVESTIGATOR_816325], a pacemaker, or an implant electrical device. A person must be 
screened before each TMS and/or M RI exam. To prevent hearing lo ss, the subject will be asked to wear 
earplugs. Persons who do not mee t the screening criteria for TM S or MRI may still be considered eligible 
for the study, but will not com plete these evaluations.   
 
6. EEG: The gel used for the el ectrodes can be washed off with shampoo. The subject will be 
advised to bring a hat to w ear for the way home. 
 
7. Unknown Risks: Subjects will be notified if we learn anythin g that might make them change their 
mind about participating in the study. 
 
 
3.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE P ROPOSED RESEARCH TO THE SUBJECTS  AND OTHERS  
 
There may be no benefit from par ticipating in this study. The p otential benefit is that the therapy the person 
receives may help gain hand f unction, although this cannot be g uaranteed. The small vibration may prove to 
increase the therapy outcome than  the therapy itself without vi bration or than other available treatments, although 
this cannot be guaranteed. The kn owledge regarding the potentia l of increasing the therapy outcome using 
unperceivable vibration as well as the underlying mechanisms is  important to increase qua lity of life of people who 
had a stroke and may benefit strok e survivors in general. The r isks are deemed reasonable in relation to the 
potential gain of knowl edge regarding  the effectiveness of this  small vibration in improving therapy outcomes, 
potential benefits of the therapy  itself, and effects on centra l nervous systems.  
 
4.  IMPORTANCE OF THE KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINED  
 
Currently hand rehabilitation t herapy outcomes are unsatisfacto ry for many patients wi th stroke. The knowledge 
regarding the potential of increasing the therapy outcome using  unperceivable vibration as well as the underlying 
mechanisms is very important to i ncrease quality of life of peo ple who had a stroke.  
 
5.  SUBJECT SAFETY AND MINIMIZI NG RISKS (Data and Safety Monito ring Plan) 
 
The TMS and MRI safety screening  by [CONTACT_816334]. All adverse effects/ events and any protocol devia tions will be documented on a case-report form 
and will be reported to the IRB at the time of the event. To pr otect participants’ confidentiality, the subject code 
will be used. Personally identifi able information will not be u sed for reporting. All study  records and data will be 
kept in a locked area and be acce ssible only to the study perso nnel. Persons who do not meet the screening 
criteria for TMS or MRI may st ill be considered eligible for th e study, but will not compl ete these evaluations.

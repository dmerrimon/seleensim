Short title  Evaluation of R adium-223 dichloride in combination with 
Abiraterone in CRPC - ERA 223 
Clinical study phase  Phase III  
Study objectives  The primary objective is to compare, in subjects with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy -naïve bone predominant 
metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer  (CRPC) , the clinical 
benefit of radium-223 dichloride versus placebo in combination with abiraterone and  prednisone / prednisolone, with the primary efficacy 
endpoint being: 
• Symptomatic skeletal event free survival (SSE -FS) 
The secondary objectives  are to compare the radium -223 dichloride 
and placebo treatments to establish additional clinically relevant improvements in subjects with CRPC bone predominant metastasis using the variables below:  
• Overall survival (OS)  
• Time to opi[INVESTIGATOR_240647]  
• Time to pain progression 
• Time to cytotoxic chemotherapy 
• Radiological progression- free survival (rPFS)  
• Safety, acute and long-term, including new primary  
malignancies  and hematopoietic reserve for tolerability of 
subsequent chemotherapy 
The study will also include the following exploratory endpoints : 
• Time to first on -study symptomatic skeletal event (SSE)  
• Percentage change in total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) from 
basel ine 
• Time to  ALP  progression 
• Time to prostate specific antigen  (PSA)  progression

Study design  International, phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel group study.  Randomization will be 
stratified by: 
• Geographical regions (Western Europe / North America / Australia v ersus  Asia versus  rest of world) 
• Concurrent use of denosumab or bisphosphonates or none 
• Total ALP < 90 U/L versus total ALP ≥ 90 U/L  
Methodology  The study will comprise 4 periods: 
Screening period:  All trial-related procedures and evaluations will only be performed 
after the subject has agreed to participate and has signed the ICF.  The screening period will consist of multiple evaluations that will take place within 2 weeks (+ 7 days) prior to randomization to ensure that all eligibility criteria are met.  
Randomization:  
Once eligibility is confirmed, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 
to treatment with radium-223 dichloride plus abiraterone and prednisone / prednisolone (Arm A) or placebo (normal saline) plus abiraterone and prednisone / prednisolone (Arm B). 
Treatment period:  
Treatment consists of up to 6 cycles of radium-223 dichloride (Arm  A) or placebo (Arm B) in combination with abiraterone plus 
prednisone / prednisolone followed by [CONTACT_267380] / prednisolone. 
• Up to 6 cycles of treatment in Arm A or Arm B:  Treatment consists of 6 IV administrations of radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) body weight (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) each separated by [CONTACT_44122] 4 wee ks plus abiraterone acetate 1000  mg every 
day plus prednisone / prednisolone 5 mg twice daily.  
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol 
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023  Version  no.7.0  Page:   10 of 153 
 
• Ongoing treatment with abiraterone plus 
prednisone / prednisolone:  After the completion of treatment 
with radium-223 dichloride (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B), all randomized subjects will continue to receive abiraterone acetate 1000  mg every day plus prednisone / prednisolone 
5 mg twice daily until disease progression (or other withdrawal criteria are met).  
After the final OS  analysis (Amendment  7): 
In order to reduce the burden to study subjects, evaluation of efficacy and exploratory endpoints will be discontinued, except for SSE and OS.  Discontinuation of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone will follow standard clinical practice; therefore, subjects who present disease progression defined as radiological progression (either by [CONTACT_267381]2), SSE, clinical progression (clinical deterioration or lack of clinical benefit, assessed by [CONTACT_1697]) or initiation of a new anti-cancer therapy, should be discontinued from study treatment.  After disease progression, abiraterone acetate will be considered standard of care (i.e., non-investigational medicinal product [non- IMP]) and 
will not be supplied as study medication. 
Subject man agement, unless defined otherwise in this protocol, will 
be in accordance with routine clinical practice, at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Subjects will be assessed every 4 weeks (± 7 days) for, 
safety  and clinical progression, at each treatment vis it and will be 
evaluated every 12  weeks (± 7 days) for radiological progression 
until disease progression occurs or subject is discontinued from study 
treatment, whichever occurs sooner. After discontinuation from study treatment, no additional radiologica l assessments will be required by 
[CONTACT_990]. 
The treatment period extends from the initiation of treatment until [ADDRESS_325276] administration of abiraterone as IMP and prednisone / prednisolone.  Until then, subjects will be followed by a visit every 4 weeks ± 7 days.  Subjects with a platelet count or white blood cell count less than the lower limit of normal at 6 months will be followed additionally until resolution at a frequency based on loca
l 
clinical practice.  
Active follow- up period with  clinic visits  and active follow- up 
period without clinic visits:  
After the final OS analysis (Amendment 7), subjects who are discontinued from study treatment will initiate the long -term follow -
up period; t herefore, the active follow -up period will no longer be 
applicable. Subjects who are in active follow-up at the time Amendment [ADDRESS_325277] the end of active follow-up completed (protocol driven decision) and should be directly transitioned  into the extended safety follow-up study. 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol 
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023  Version  no.7.0  Page:   11 of 153 
 
Long -term follow -up: 
After the final OS analysis  (Amendment 7), subjects who are 
discontinued from study treatment will initiate the long -term follow -
up period in order to collect safety and OS information. The long-
term follow -up period will end when the subject has completed 
[ADDRESS_325278] to follow -up, withdraws informed 
consent, actively objects to collection of further data, or is transitioned to the extended safety follow-up study. During this period, subjects will be monitored via telephone call every 6 months for survival, treatment- related AEs and SAEs ; and all occurrences of 
leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia; and primary bone cancer or any other new primary malignancy.  All bone fractures and bone associated events (e.g., osteoporosis) need to  be 
report ed as either AEs or SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met, 
regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment. In addition, subjects who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy will be followed up for the development of febrile neutropenia and hemorrhage during their chemotherapy treatment and f or up to 6 months at a frequency based 
on local clinical practice.  
Once a separate extended safety follow -up protocol for the inclusion 
of subjects who received radium-223 dichloride / placebo in the course of Bayer sponsored clinical trials has been implemented, the study subjects who are in active follow-up or in long- term follow -up 
will be transitioned to a separate extended safety follow -up study  in 
order to complete 7 years of safety follow-up.  All efforts will be made to transition all subjects to the extended safety follow-up study. 
 
End of study  (after implementation of Amendment 8): 
The end of the study (EOS) is defined as the date of the last subject last visit in the study. The EOS will occur at the time the last subject on study completes [ADDRESS_325279] to follow-up.  
Number of subjects  800 in total (with 1:1 randomization)  
Primary variable SSE-FS 
Plan for statistical analysis The analysis of efficacy will be performed using the intent- to-treat 
population, defined as all subjects who are randomized.   
The overall 2-sided type I error rate for the analysis of primary 
efficacy endpoint, SSE -FS, is 0.05. 
Symptomatic skeletal event-free survival will be analyzed using a stratified log -rank test with the same stratification factors as for 
randomization.  The hazard ratio ( HR; radium-223 
dichloride / placebo) will be computed together with the 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) using  a stratified Cox regression model, with 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol 
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023  Version  no.7.0  Page:   [ADDRESS_325280], with the factors from the 
randomization used for stratification.  A n HR  with a 95% CI  from a 
stratified Cox proportional hazards model will also be provided.  
Kaplan -Meier plots will be produc ed to accompany these analyses.  
Data collected  following the final OS analysis will be analyzed 
descriptively only. Analysis may be done through listings.  
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC ) An IDMC  will be established for this study to review accumulating 
efficacy and safety data at regular intervals throughout the study and monitor overall study conduct.  The IDMC  will include experts in 
oncology, biostatistics, and safety who are not participating in this trial and do not have affiliation with the investigators or the sponsor or other significant conflicts of interest.  Their main objective will be to protect the interests of the subjects in the study and of those still to 
be entered.  They will do this by [CONTACT_267382], study progress, and protocol compliance, as well as assessing the risk  / benefit of the trial.   
Independent Data Monitoring Committee meetings will be held every [ADDRESS_325281] if needed.  
Note: No longer applicable after primary analysis.

1. Introduction  
1.1 Castrate resistant prostate cancer:  Disease and treatment 
Prostate cancer has become an increasingly important health issue globally.  Prostate cancer 
is the fifth most common tumor type worldwide, with 679,060 men diagnosed each year,( 1) 
and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related morbidity and death.( 2) 
Prostate cancer is hormone sensitive at the time of initial diagnosis.  Although most patients with advanced metastatic disease initially respond to conventional androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with medical ( 3) or surgi cal (4) castration, the median duration of disease 
control has been 13 to 22 months and overall survival (OS) 28 to 36 months.( 5)  After 
progression to castration-resistant disease, close to 90% of those men already have bone metastases, and all their related undesirable effects, such as pain and deterioration of health -related quality of life ( HRQoL).  Patients with metastatic castration -resistant prostate 
cancer (CRPC) have a very limited life expectancy and most often die of their prostate cancer.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_325294] been approved as palliative therapy for prostate cancer.  Estramustine was approved in the 1970s; however, in a randomized study where OS was compared, diethylstilbestrol (DES), a hormonal agent, was found to be superior to estramustine.( 6)  In 
1996, mitoxantrone and prednisone were approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) for palliation of pain and improvement in HRQoL in a randomized study with prednisone as control.( 7)  
Docetaxel was the first agent that has demonstrated a survival benefit in CRPC.  In the TAX-327 study, a 3-weekly docetaxel regimen had a median OS of 18.9 months 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 17.0 to 21.2) compared with the mitoxantrone control arm of 
16.5 months (95% CI , 14.4 to 18.6 months).  The hazard ratio (HR) for death was 0.76 
(95% CI , 0.62 to 0.94, p = 0.009) in the docetaxel regimen as compared with control.( 8)  
Results from the Southwest Oncology Group Study 99-16 in  770 men (3- weekly 
docetaxel  + estramustine +  dexamethasone versus mitoxantrone + prednisone) demonstrated 
a median OS of 17.5 months versus 15.6 months, respectively, p = 0.02 and were consistent 
with the TAX -327 data.( 8,9)  The results of these [ADDRESS_325295] -line treatment of CRPC, and the toxicity of this agent was considered 
acceptable.  
Cabazitaxel, a novel member of the taxane class of anti -microtubule agents, demonstrated 
effectiveness in preclinical models that were resistant to paclitaxel and docetaxel.( 10,11)  
Furthermore, cabazitaxel is able to cross the blood -brain barrier, a potential advantage in the 
treatment of some malignancies.( 12)  In a phase III clinical trial that was launched with the 
aim of  comparing cabazitaxel to mitoxantrone in docetaxel- refractory CRPC,(13) 
755 patients were treated with prednisone (10 mg daily) and randomized to receive either cabazitaxel ( 25 mg/m
2) or mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2) every 3 weeks, with OS as the primary 
endpoint.  The median OS was 15.1 months in the cabazitaxel group and 12.7 months in the mitoxantrone group (HR = 0.70; p < 0.0001).  Cabaz itaxel was associated with a higher 
incidence of adverse events (AEs) than mitoxantrone.  The most common toxicities associated with cabazitaxel were neutropenia, anemia, and diarrhea.  Of note, peripheral neuropathy was uncommon and typi[INVESTIGATOR_267333].  The results of this

phase III clinical trial led to the approval of cabazitaxel for the second -line treatment of 
CRPC in many countries. 
1.1.2 Secondary hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_267334]-androgens, ketoconazole or 
abiraterone acetate, steroids, DES, or other estrogens based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN ) guideline, version 3.( 14) 
Ketoconazole inhibits several adrenal enzymes required for steroid biosynthesis.  Its efficacy in prostate cancer in terms of prostate specific antigen (PSA) response is comparable to that of aminoglutethimide.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_267335]-androgen withdrawal (AAWD) showed that 55% of patients achieved a 50% PSA decline.( 15)  When administered after 
AAWD, 36 % to 62.5% of patients had a 50% PSA decline.( 16,17 )  In a phase III study 
conducted by [CONTACT_27746] B, the PSA response rate was 27% with a median duration of response of 9 months in the group of patients randomized to the combination arm of AAWD and ketoconazole plus hydrocortisone versus the AAWD alone arm.  Objective responses were observed in 2% of patients tre ated with AAWD alone 
compared to 20% in patients treated with AAWD / ketoconazole (p = 0.02).  The median time 
to PSA progression was 8.6 months in patients treated with simultaneous AAWD and ketoconazole while it was only 5.9 months with AAWD alone.  Ther e was no difference in 
survival.( 18)  However, ketoconazole inhibits cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 with substantial 
risk of drug-drug interactions, such as warfarin and statins,( 19) and it is often poorly tolerated 
by [CONTACT_1962], with commonly occurring side effects including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and depression.( 16-18)  Ketoconazole is not approved for the treatment of CRPC. 
Glucocorticoids appear to possess both hormonal and direct anti- tumor effects in prostate 
cancer.  Patients with CRPC may still have hormone- sensitive disease that is stimulated by 
[CONTACT_267383], and these androgens are suppressed by [CONTACT_267384] (ACTH).  Tannock et al. have demonstrated that low-dose prednisone treatment (7.5 to 10 mg daily) led to a decrease in the concentration of serum testosterone in 7 of 9 patients where it was not initially 
suppressed below 2.0 nmol/mL, and caused a decrease in serum levels of androstenedione and dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_267336] 50% of patients.( 20) These  changes were 
associated with symptomatic and clinical improvement.  Gluc ocorticoids may also have 
direct inhibitory effects on prostate cancer cells through enhanced growth inhibitory transforming growth factor beta-1 signaling and suppression of the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor kappa- B (NF -κB).( 21,22).  
Prednisone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone have been frequently administered as standard of care in advanced prostate cancer because of their modest anti -tumor activity and 
palliative effects on disease.  Two prospective phase III studies have documented the safety profile and palliative benefit of prednisone.  Prednisone 7.5 to 10 mg daily was examined among 81 patients in one arm of a phase III trial, with 22% of patients achieving a 50% PSA decline and a median time to progression of 4.0 months.( 23)  Likewise, in a randomized 
study control arm where 201 patients were treated with prednisone 5 mg twice daily, a PSA decline of ≥ 50% was observed in 21% of patients.( 24)  Significant improvements in pain, 
HRQoL, and fatigue were also reported.  Other glucocorticoids hav e similar activity in 
advanced prostate cancer.

BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023  Version  no.7.0  Page:   [ADDRESS_325296] commonly used estrogen is DES.( 25-27) 
Although estrogens remain an option for the secondary hormonal treatment of CRPC, their use is limited by [CONTACT_267385].( 28) 
1.1.[ADDRESS_325297] common site of cancer spread in men with CRPC is bone.  Development of bone metastases is a major problem in prostate cancer and is a serious threat to a patient’s survival and HRQoL.  Untreated patients face severe m orbidity, including bone pain, bone fracture, 
compression of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and hematological consequences of bone marrow involvement.  
Skeletal homeostasis is carried out by [CONTACT_267386] .  There are several potential explanations for the marked predisposition of prostate 
cancer to metastasize preferentially to bones.( 29)  Both osteoblasts and osteoclasts appear to 
play a critical role in the interactions between prostate cancer cells and bone, and the receptor activator of NF -κB ligand (RANKL) is a key element in osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, 
and chemo -attraction of tumor c ells.( 30)  The prominent role of bone metastases in the 
natural history of metastatic prostate cancer has prompted investigators to target this site of metastasis in hopes of palliating symptoms and prolonging survival through the use of androgen ablation, bisphosphonates, radiopharmaceuticals, focal radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted agents.( 29) 
Unfortunately, therapeutic options at this stage of illness are still limited.  
Zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate, has been shown to delay and reduce skeletal- related 
events (SREs) in patients with CRPC ( 31) by [CONTACT_267387]; however, these results may not apply to other bisphosphonates (e.g., pamidronate results were not positive in the same setting).  None of these agents improved the overall or prostate cancer -specific survival of patients with CRPC.  
More recently, denosumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds RANKL, has been found to be more effective than zoledronic acid as measured by [CONTACT_240701]-study SREs in patients with CRPC.  The median time to the first on -study SRE was 20.7 months for 
the denosumab group compared with 17.1 months for the zoledronic acid group (HR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.95; p = 0.008 for superiority).( 32)  Denosumab was approved for the 
treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors in bone by [CONTACT_267388] ( FDA ) and the European Comm ission  in 2010. 
Bone-seeking radionuclides have been developed for palliation of bone pain from metastases .(33) Metastron  (strontium-89) and Quadramet (samarium-153 E DTMP) (34) have 
been approved in several countries.  The bone-seeking nature of these agents results in direct delivery of beta radiation to the sites of disease.  Due to the long range of the beta particles from these radioisotopes, the major dose- limiting factor with this treatment modality is 
toxicity to the bone marrow cells, limiting the use of these agents to pain palliation only as they have not demonstrated an OS  benefit .  This toxicity has seriously limited their clinical 
use.

1.1.4 Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer 
Approximately 50% of patients with metastatic prosta te cancer will have no noticeable 
symptoms related to the tumor.( 35)  Cytotoxic chemotherapy (docetaxel or mitoxantrone) is 
ordinarily reserved for patients with symptomatic or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_267337].( 36)  The 
American Society of Clinical Oncology / Cancer Care of Ontario and European Association 
of Urology guidelines for the cytotoxic treatment of CRPC ( 28,37) emphasize the need to 
individualize the timing of non-hormonal therapy for prostate cancer and consider routine docetaxel questionable in men who have metastatic disease but lack symptoms.  Similarly, the current European Society of Medical Oncology guidelines ( 38) for metastatic prostate 
cancer recommend that patients with castrate -resistant disease should receive second and 
possibly third-line hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], while chemotherapy with docetaxel given every 3 weeks should be considered for patients with CRPC who are symptomatic.( 38) 
Patients with metastatic CRPC who are not good  candidates for immediate chemotherapy 
may still benefit from alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_267338] a short period of time. 
Abiraterone acetate, a pro -drug of abiraterone and a selective inhibitor of androgen 
biosynthesis that potently blocks CYP17, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic 
CRPC in patients who have failed treatment with docetaxel.  Recently, this agent in combination with prednisone / prednisolone was shown to significantly delay disease progression, when compared to placebo in combination with prednisone / prednisolone (HR = 0.43; p- value = 0.0001).( 39)  As a result, abirater one plus prednisone / prednisolone 
was approved by [CONTACT_267389] -naïve metastatic CRPC.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_267339], skeletal events  
remain a therapeutic challenge; therefore, the combination of abiraterone and prednisone / prednisolone with bone- targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_267340].  
1.2 Study medications 
1.2.1 Radium-223 dichloride 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug development 
Radium-223 dichloride solution for injection is a novel alpha particle emitting radiopharmaceutical.  The bone-targeting property of radium- 223 is similar to that of other 
earth alkaline elements, like calcium or strontium-89.  However, the radiation characteristics of an alpha particle emitting radionuclide appear to be more advantageous than of a beta-emitting radionuclide.  Radium-223, with a physical half-life of 11.4 days, emits high linear energy transfer (LET) alpha radiation, with a range limited to less than 100 micrometers.  The high LET of alpha emitters (80 keV/micrometer) leads to a high frequency of double-strand deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) breaks in adjacent cells, resulting in 
an anti -tumor effect on bone metastases.  The alpha particle range from radiu m-223 
dichloride is less than 100 micrometers (less than 10 cell diameters) which limits damage to the surrounding normal tissue. 
Biodistribution studies have shown that radium-223 is selectively concentrated in bone 
compared to soft tissues, and that radium-223 is retained in the bone matrix.( 40,41) Due  to 
increased bone metabolism in skeletal metastases, preferential uptake in these lesions

demonstrated in an experimental skeletal metastases model in nude rats .(41) 
The clinical development of radium-[ADDRESS_325299] could be administered safely at 
therapeutically relevant doses.  A total of 31 patients were enrolled.  Twenty- five patients 
received a single intravenous (IV) injection in the dose escalating part of the study, with 5 patients at each dose level of 46, 93, 163, 213, and 250 kBq/kg body weight radium-223 dichloride.  The results of this phase I study were encouraging (low toxicity, significant pain relief, and decreased serum alkaline phosphatase [ALP]); thus, a phase II trial (BC1 -02 study) 
for CRPC was conducted,( 40) where patients received multiple doses of either 50 kBq/kg 
body weight radium-[ADDRESS_325300] frequent AE was transient diarrhea, which responded well to medication.  In terms of efficacy, the BC1-02 phase II results showed a significant improvement in serum bone markers, i.e., bone ALP (a primary efficacy endpoint), and perhaps more importantly, a delayed time to PSA progression.  Median OS  at 2 years was 65.3 weeks for radium-223 dichloride and 
46.3 weeks for placebo (HR = 2.1; p = 0.017 based on an intent- to-treat [ITT] population and 
adjusting for baseline covariates).  
Following the positive results of the phase II trial, the phase III, double-blind, randomized, BC1-06, ALSYMPCA ( Alpharadin in Sym ptomatic P rostate Ca ncer) trial was started in 
2008.  A total of 922 patients with CRPC and symptomatic bone metastases were randomized to receive 6 injections of radium-223 dichloride (50  kBq/kg IV) or matching placebo every 
4 weeks.  Based on data of an interim analysis (n  = 809), the study was unblinded in 
June 2011, since radium-223 dichloride significantly improved OS, compared to placebo (the median OS was 14.0 versu s 11.2 months, respectively; HR = 0.695; p = 0.[ZIP_CODE]).  
Symptomatic skeletal events (SSE s) were lower in the radium -[ADDRESS_325301] SSE  was significantly delayed (the median time to S SE was 13.6 months versus 
8.4 months, respectively; HR  = 0.610; p = 0.[ZIP_CODE]).  A low incidence of myelosuppression 
was observed, with Grade 3/4 events of neutropenia (1.8%) and thrombocytopenia (6.2%).  Adverse events of any grade were described in 88% of the subjects who received radium-223 dichloride versus 94% in the placebo arm ( Grade 3/4 AE s were described for 51% and 59%, 
respectively).  The updated analysis (performed in June 2012) also showed that radium-223 dichloride significantly improved OS compared to placebo (median OS 14.9 versus  
11.3 months, respectively; p = 0.[ZIP_CODE]; HR = 0.695).( 42)

[IP_ADDRESS]  Benefits and risks 
Anticipated benefits of treatment with radium-223 dichloride include prolongation of OS , 
delay of SS Es, and anti -tumor efficacy measured by [CONTACT_267390], palliation of bone pain, 
and improvement in quality of life. 
The risk profile attributed to radium-223 dichloride is favorable compared with available 
products for the treatment of CRPC.  The anticipated risks attributed to radium-223 dichloride include the following AEs:  gastr ointestinal (constipation, transient but treatable

diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting); hematological (transient reduction in neutrophil count, mild 
to moderate myelosuppression, low grade thrombocytopenia); and, because of its radioactive nature, it cannot be excluded that radium-223 dichloride may, in the longer term, induce other primary cancers and bone marrow changes.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosing rationale 
The proposed dosing regimen in this phase III trial is 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of National Institute of S tandards and Technology [ NIST ] update ) body 
weight every 4 weeks for a 6 -month treatment period (6 injections).  In the completed phase I 
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical study (ATI -BC-1), patients diagnosed 
with prostate or breast c arcinoma and skeletal metastases were administered radium -223 
dichloride in single doses of 46, 93, 163, 213, or 250 kBq/kg body weight (25 patients) or multiple doses of 5 administrations of 50 kBq/kg body weight at 3-week intervals (3 patients) or 2 admi nistrations of 125 kBq/kg body weight at 6-week intervals (3 patients).  In the 
completed phase II study, 64 patients with CRPC and painful skeletal metastases received 4 injections of 50 kBq/kg body weight radium-223 dichloride (33 patients) or placebo (31 patients) at 4 -week intervals, to examine the effects of radium -223 dichloride on 
biomarkers of disease progression, SSEs, pain palliation, survival, and safety parameters.  The completed phase III trial, ALSYMPCA, enrolled 922 patients diagnosed with CRPC and symptomatic bone metastases who received 6 injections of radium-223 dichloride (50 kBq/kg IV) at 4-week intervals.  Endpoints included OS, time to disease- related events, time to 
progression as measured by [CONTACT_240702], pain palliation, acute and long-term safety profile, and HR QoL.  The efficacy and safety data from the 
ALSYMPCA trial support the selection of a dosing regimen of 6 doses of 50 kBq/kg body weight of radium-[ADDRESS_325302] on bone marrow suppression following multiple administrations of radium-223 dichloride. 
Currently, no data are available to assess if similar effects could be achieved with a dose 
lower than 50 kBq/kg body weight.  However, patients diagnosed with CRPC have a poor prognosis with a median survival of approximately 3 years and, as no curative treatment is 
available, it is important that the dose administered is effective and well tolerated.  
1.2.2 Abiraterone acetate 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug development 
Abiraterone ( JNJ-589485, formerly CB7598) is 17- (3-pyridyl) androsta-5,16- dien-3β-ol and 
is a selective irreversible steroidal inhibitor of CYP17 (17α hydroxylase/C17,20- lyase) .  This 
enzyme is found in the testes, adrenals, and in prostate tumors and blocks 2 important enzymatic activities in the synthesis of testosterone ( Figure 1–1).  Abiraterone is a potent 
inhibitor with an apparent inhibition constant of 0.5 nM.  Pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated that its effects on adrenal steroid synthesis were consistent with its mechanism of action.  Anti-tumor effects were evident with PSA response and durable objective responses using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) ( 43) in phase I and 
phase II studies conducted to date. 
Abiraterone acetate ( JNJ-2120482, formerly CB7630, Zytiga®) is the 3-acetylated analog of 
abiraterone and , thus, a pro -drug of abiraterone.  The chemical nomenclature of abiraterone 
acetate is 3β -acetoxy -17-(3-pyridyl) androsta-5, 16- diene; its empi[INVESTIGATOR_24598] 
C
26H33NO 2; and molecular weight is 391.55.  Once absorbed after oral administration,

of patients.  Declines in circulating tumor cell counts,( 44) normalization of lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), and improving symptoms with a reduction in analgesic use w ere 
commonly documented.  Twenty -three patients received abiraterone acetate capsules for 
more than 12 months as part of an extension protocol.( 45) Similar  response rates were 
observed in COU- AA-002, a parallel phase I/II study investigating tablet formulation.( 46) 
In the double-blind phase III study (COU- AA-302), 1088 chemo- naïve patients with 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC were randomized and received 
abiraterone acetate (1000 mg) plus prednisone (5 mg twice daily) or placebo plus prednisone.( 47) The  co-primary endpoints were radiological progression- free survival (rPFS) 
and OS.  The study was unblinded after the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) unanimously recommended unblinding treatment and allowing subjects in the placebo group to receive abiraterone acetate.  This was after a planned interim analysis that was performed after 43% of the expected deaths had occurred.   The median rPFS was 
16.5 months with abiraterone–prednisone and 8.3 months with prednisone alone (HR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.62; p < 0.001).  Over a median follow-up period of 22.2 months, OS was improved with abiraterone–prednisone (median not reached, versus  27.2 months for 
prednisone alone; HR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.93; p = 0.01) but did not cross the efficacy boundary.  Abiraterone–prednisone showed superiority over prednisone alone with respect to time to initiation of cytotoxic chemothe rapy, opi[INVESTIGATOR_267343]- related pain, PSA 
progression, and decline in performance status.  Grade 3 or 4 mineralocorticoid- related AEs 
and abnormalities on liver-function tests were more common with abiraterone–prednisone.  
The results of this phase III clinical trial led to the recent approval of abiraterone–prednisone 
for the treatment of patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC before chemotherapy by [CONTACT_267392].   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosing rationale 
The dose of abiraterone acetate in this study is 1000 mg daily based on results of 2 P hase I 
dose-finding studies ( 48) and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_267344] -AA-302.( 49)   
In the first phase I study with capsule formulation (COU- AA-001), abiraterone acetate was 
evaluated for safety, PK , and its effects on adrenal steroid synthesis at dose levels ranging 
from 250 to 2000 mg.  Preliminary analysis showed that abiraterone acetate had an acceptable safety profile at all dose levels.  Patients received abiraterone acetate during the study and in an extension protocol, with some patients on treatment for more than 48 months.  In the second phase I study (COU- AA-002) ( 45,48 ) that evaluated t he safety and tolerability 
of abiraterone acetate tablet formulation at doses ranging from [ADDRESS_325303] an acceptable safety profile for further development. 
Consistent with abiraterone acetate’s mechanism of action, hypertension, hypokalemia, and 
lower extremity edema were the most commonly  observed drug- related AEs, which were all 
manageable with medication.  Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased systemic drug 
exposure at higher doses.  Adrenal metabolite analysis showed inhibition of CYP17 even at low doses of abiraterone acetate and a compensatory increase of corticosterone and deoxycorticosterone.  Data from the dose-finding studies indicated that when PK , adrenal 
CYP17 inhibition, and efficacy signals were taken into consideration, the 1000-mg dose offered consistent pharmacological effects without additional side effects.  Based upon these findings, the 1000-mg dose was chosen for further efficacy and safety evaluation in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_267345].

1.2.3 Concurrent prednisone  / prednisolone 
Data from early studies have contributed to the current understanding of the mechanism of 
abiraterone action.  These suggest that a state of mineralocorticoid excess can occur after pharmacologic inhibition of CYP17, with the resulting reduced cortisol levels leading to a compensatory ACTH surge and accompanying hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention.( 50)  These side effects were readily managed with potassium supplementation, 
eplerenone (selective mineralocorticoid antagonist), antihypertensive agents, and low dose corticosteroids.  Grade [ADDRESS_325304] of care ( 28) in combination with approved chemotherapy agents or as a 
monotherapy for palliation of symptoms.   
The safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate with concurrently administered prednisone has 
been evaluated in phase II and III studies.  In patients with CRPC without previous chemotherapy , fatigue, arthralgia, and peripheral edema were among the AE s rep orted more 
frequently in the abiraterone–prednisone group than in the prednisone-alone group.  Grade 3 or 4 AE s classified as hepatotoxicity, consisting primarily of a reversible elevation in 
aminotransferase levels, were reported in 8% of patients in the abiraterone –prednisone group 
and 3% of patients in the prednisone-alone group.  Mineralocorticoid- related toxic effects 
were more common in the abiraterone–prednisone group than in the prednisone-alone group, including hypertension (22% versus  13%), hypoka lemia (17% v ersus  13%), and fluid 
retention or edema (28% versus  24%), and were mostly Grade 1 or 2 AE s.(39) The  regimen

therefore, not eligible for cytotoxic chemotherapy with docetaxel.

BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023  Version  no.7.0  Page:   [ADDRESS_325306] profiles for radium -223 dichloride and abirater one acetate are not 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], a dose-finding study or a run-in dose escalation evaluation is not considered 
necessary for an analysis of combination treatment.  The mode of action differs for both compounds, as abiraterone targets androgen synthesis in testes, adrenal glands, and prostate cancer cells; whereas, radium -223 dichloride delivers alpha radiation to bone lesions of 
prostate cancer.  Based upon these individual effects, it is expected that the combination of both agents will prolong symptomatic  skeletal event -free survival ( SSE- FS) compared to 
treatment with abiraterone acetate alone.  
The study described herein has been designed to investigate the effects of radium-223 dichloride added to abiraterone acetate and prednisone / prednisolone in subj ects with 
chemotherapy -naïve CRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and who have 
bone predominant metastasis, which has progressed during ADT.  The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled phase III trial comparing radium-223 
dichloride (50 kBq/kg [55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update ] body weight, every 
4 weeks for 6 single doses) administered with abiraterone acetate and prednisone / prednisolone versus placebo administ ered with abiraterone acetate and prednisone / 
prednisolone. 
1.4 Primary efficacy endpoints 
Symptomatic skeletal event- free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the 
occurrence of one of the following: 
(1) An on-study SSE, which is defined as: 
a. the use of external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) to relieve skeletal symptoms  
b. the occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or 
non-vertebral)  
c. the occurrence of spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377] 
d. a tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention. 
(2) Death from any cause 
Since the definition for measuring skeletal events will not use pre-specified imaging 
assessments, the use of imaging to identify a fracture or spi[INVESTIGATOR_267346].  As such, only symptomatic events will be captured; asymptomatic radiographic events are not included in this composite endpoint.  A delay or a reduction of SSEs represents an immediate clinical benefit, as it will delay or reduce bone pain, functional impairment, and the need for surgical intervention.  
In ALSY MPCA, treatment with radium-[ADDRESS_325307] SS E from 
9.8 to 15.6 months (HR = 0.658; p = 0.[ZIP_CODE]; data on file).  In 2007, Saad and colleagues were able to demonstrate that pathologic fractures correlate 
with reduced survival in patients with malignant bone disease.  After adjustment for baseline characteristics, including performance status and prior skeletal complications, patients with prostate cancer had a > 20% increased risk of death.( 51) As  this correlation is not universally 
accepted, in the trial herein, the time to first S SE and OS  will be combined as SSE- FS.  Thus, 
either a S SE or death will count as an event.  
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol 
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023  Version  no.7.0  Page:   31 of 153 
 
The median S SE-FS in ALSYMPCA was 9.0 and 6.4 months with and without radium-223 
dichloride, respectively (HR = 0.685; p = 0.[ZIP_CODE]).  An ad- hoc analysis (data on file) in 
patients who did not receive doc etaxel prior to radium-223 dichloride indicated that the 
median duration of SSE- FS is preserved in this subgroup of 395 patients (SSE- FS was 
9.5 months with and 6.7 months without radium-223 dichloride). 
In conclusion, SSE- FS is an  objective variable that is  likely to predict clinical benefit in the 
proposed study populations. 
2. Study objectives  
The primary objective is to compare, in subjects with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic 
chemotherapy -naïve bone predominant metastatic CRPC, the clinical benefit of radium-223

4. Study design  
4.1 Design overview 
This study is a phase III, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled study with a randomization allocation ratio of 1:1 (radium-223 dichloride 
plus abiraterone acetate plus prednisone / prednisolone:placebo plus abiraterone acetate plus prednisone / prednisolone).  Randomization will be stratified by: 
• Geographical regions (Western Europe / North America  / Australia v ersus  Asia versus  
rest of world)  
• Concurrent use of denosumab or bisphosphonates or none   
• Total ALP < 90 U/L versus total ALP ≥ 90 U/L  
This study will be conducted at approximately 170 investigative study centers and approximately 800 subjects will be enrolled.  
4.1.1 Study periods and duration 
Until the final OS analysis, the study period consisted of screening / randomization, 
treatment, active follow -up with clinic visits, active follow -up without clinic visits, and long-
term follow -up phases.  Up until this point, subjects received study treatment (radium-223 
dichloride or placebo in addition to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone / prednisolone for the first 6 cycles followed by [CONTACT_267396] / prednisolone thereafter) until an on-study SSE occurred (or other withdrawal cr iteria were met).  
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol 
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023  Version  no.7.0  Page:   34 of 153 
 
After the final OS analysis ( Amendment 7), in order to reduce the burden to study subjects, 
evaluation of efficacy and exploratory endpoints will be  discontinued, except for SSE  and 
OS.  Subjects who  are discontinued from study treatment will initiate the long -term follow -up 
period; therefore,  active follow -up periods will no longer be applicable.   Subjects who  are in  
active follow -up at the time of Amendment [ADDRESS_325310] the end of ac tive 
follow-up completed (protocol driven decision) and should be directly transitioned into the 
extended safety follow-up study. 
Long term follow-up period will end when the subject has completed [ADDRESS_325311] to follow -up, withdraws informed consent, actively objects to collection of further 
data, or is transitioned to the extended safety follow-up study. Subjects will be followed for 
safety for up to 7 years, which eventually will be completed in this study or in the extended safety follow-up study. 
Screening period:  All trial- related procedures and evaluations will only be performed after the subject has 
agreed to participate and has signed the informed consent form ( ICF).  The screening period 
will consist of multiple evaluations that will take place within 2 weeks (+ 7  days) prior to 
randomization to ensure that all eligibility criteria are met (Section 5.1).  
Randomization:  Once eligibility is confirmed, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with 
radium-223 dichloride plus abiraterone and prednisone / prednisolone (Arm A) or placebo (normal saline) plus abiraterone and prednisone / prednisolone (Arm B). 
Treatment period:  
Treatment consists of up to 6 cycles of radium-223 dichloride ( Arm A) or placebo (Arm B ) in 
combination with abiraterone plus prednisone / prednisolone followed by [CONTACT_267380] / prednisolone. 
• Up to 6 cycles of treatment in Arm A or Arm B:  Treatment consists of 6 IV administrations of radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update ) body weight (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) each separated by [CONTACT_267397] 4 weeks plus abiraterone acetate 1000 mg every day  plus prednisone / 
prednisolone 5 mg twice daily.  
• Ongoing treatment with abiraterone plus prednisone / prednisolone:  After the comple tion of treatment with radium-223 dichloride (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B), all 
randomized subjects will continue to receive abiraterone acetate 1000 mg every day plus prednisone / prednisolone 5 mg twice daily until disease progression occurs (or other withdrawal criteria are met).  
After final OS analysis  (Amendment  7): 
In order to reduce the burden to study subjects, evaluation of  efficacy and exploratory endpoints will be  discontinued, except for SSE and OS .  Discontinuation of abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone/ prednisolone will follow standard clinical practice ; therefore, subjects  
who present disease progression defined as radiological progression (either by [CONTACT_267398]2), SSE, clinical progression (clinical deterioration or lack of clinical benefit, assessed by [CONTACT_1697]), or initiation of a new anti-cancer therapy, should be discontinued from study treatment. After disease progression, abiraterone acetate will be

considered standar d of care (i.e., non-investigational medicinal product [non IMP]) and will 
not be supplied as study medication. 
Subject management, unless defined otherwise in this protocol, will be in accordance with 
routine clinical practice, at the discretion of the in vestigator.  Subjects will be assessed every 
4 weeks (± 7 days) for safety and clinical progression, at each treatment visit and will be evaluated every 12  weeks (±  7 days) for radiological progression until disease progression 
occurs or subject is discontinued from study treatment, whichever occurs sooner. After discontinuation from study treatment, no additional radiological assessments will be required by [CONTACT_990]. 
The treatment period extends from the initiation of treatment until [ADDRESS_325312] 
administration of abiraterone as IMP and prednisone / prednisolone.  If the subject  receives 
abiraterone/prednisone as the standard of care (non- IMP) after disease progression, as defined 
above , this will not be considered part of the treatment period and it will not be considered as 
new anti -cancer therapy .  During the treatment period, subject s will be followed by a visit 
every 4 weeks  ± [ADDRESS_325313] s with a platelet count (PLT) or white blood cell (WBC) 
count less than the lower limit of n ormal at 6 months will be followed additionally until 
resolution at a frequency based on local clinical practice. 
Active follow- up period with  clinic visits and active follow- up period without  clinic visits:  
After the final OS analysis  (Amendment 7), subjects who are discontinued from study 
treatment will initiate the long term follow -up period; therefore, the a ctive follow -up periods 
will no longer be applicable. Subjects who  are in  active follow -up at the time Amendment [ADDRESS_325314] the end of active follow -up completed (protocol driven decision) 
and should be directly transitioned into the extended safety follow-up study. For additional 
information, please refer to  Section 13.6. 
Long- term  follow- up: 
After the final OS analysis  (Amendment 7),  subjects who are discontinued from study 
treatment will initiate the long -term follow -up period in order to collect safety and OS 
information.  The long- term follow -up period will end when the subject ha s completed 
[ADDRESS_325315] to f ollow-up, withdraws informed consent, actively objects 
to collection of further data, or is transitioned to the extended safety follow-up study. 
During this period, subjects will be monitored via telephone call every 6 months for survival; 
treatment -related AEs and SAEs, and all occurrences of leukemia, myelodysplastic 
syndrome, aplastic anemia; and primary bone cancer or any other new primary malignancy.  All bone fractures and bone associated events (e.g., osteoporosis) need to  be repor ted as 
either AEs or SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met, regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment.   In addition, subjects who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy will be followed up 
for the development of febrile neutropenia and hemorrhage during their chemotherapy treatment and for up to 6 months at a frequency based on local clinical practice. 
Once a separate extended safety follow -up protocol for the inclusion of subjects who received 
radium-223 dichloride / placebo in the course of Bayer sponsored clinical trials has been 
implemented, the surviving study subjects who are in active follow-up or the long- term follow -
up will be transitioned to a separate extended safety follow -up study in order to complete 
7 years of safety follow -up.  All efforts will be made to transition all subjects to the extended 
safety follow -up study. The end of the  study (EOS) is defined as the date of the last subject last

5.2 Withdrawal of subjects from study 
5.2.1 Withdrawal 
All subjects who enter the trial should complete all phases of the protocol:  
1. Screening  
2. Randomization 
3. Treatment period  
4. Long- term follow up  
Note:   Study drug discontinuation (i.e., discontinuation during the treatment period) does not 
constitute withdrawal from the study.  Every effort should be made to transition  subjects who 
discontinue the treatment period for any reason to the extended safety  follow -up study . 
Subjects are expected to participate in the follow -up unless they explicitly object.  
Withdrawal of consent should be documented in the subject’s medical file.  If the subject 
does not wish to be followed up further, he should sign the ‘ Declaration of objection to 
collection of study data after withdrawal of consent form.’  
A “dropout” is defined as a subject who has been randomized and discontinues study participation prematurely  for any reason.
 
A “screening failure” is defined as a subject who has signed informed consent and terminates the study for any reason (e.g., failure to satisfy the selection criteria) before randomization.  
Any subject removed from the study will remain under medical supervision until discharge or 
transfer is medically acceptable.  
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF and in the subject’s medical records (consent  withdrawal [due to AE or for other reason], lost to follow-up, or 
death).  
When a subject is withdrawn from the study, i.e., is not attending follow-up visits, the end-of-study page in the eCRF is to be completed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal from treatment period (collection of follow-up data)  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from the study treatment for the following reasons: 
• If, in the investigator’ s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the study treatment would be harmful 
to the subject’ s well -being. 
• If the subject experiences un acceptable toxicities to any study drugs. 
• Delay in all study treatment of > 4 weeks (maximum of 8 weeks between 2 injections of radium-223 dichloride / placebo ). 
• If the subject starts treatment with a prohibited prostate cancer therapy 
(Section  6.9.1).  
• At his own request or at the request of his legally acceptable representative. 
• At the specific request of the sponsor and in liaison with the investigator (e.g., 
obvious non- compliance, safety concerns).  
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol 
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023  Version  no.7.0  Page:   42 of 153 
 
• For disease progression characterized by [CONTACT_267403] (either by [CONTACT_267404]2), SSE, clinical progression (clinical deterioration or 
lack of clinical benefit, assessed by [CONTACT_1697]), or initiation of a new anti- cancer 
therapy. 
After the final OS analysis ( Amendment 7): 
In order to reduce the burden to study subjects, evaluation of efficacy and exploratory 
endpoints will be  discontinued, except for SSE  and OS . Discontinuation of abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone will follow standard clinical practice, therefore, subjects  
who present disease progression, as defined above, or that start a new anti -cancer therapy 
should be discontinued from study treatment. After disease progression, abiraterone acetate 
will be considered standard of care (i.e., non-investigational medicinal product [non- IMP]) 
and will not be supplied as study medication.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal from treatment period and all follow-up  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from the study treatment and / or procedures and no further data 
will be collected for the following reasons: 
• Subject withdraws consent from study treatment and study procedures.  A subject must be removed from the study at his own request or at the request of his legally acceptable representative.  At any time during the study and without giving reasons, a subject may decline to p articipate further;  the subject ’s rights will be protected.  
• Subject is lost to follow -up 
• Death  
5.2.[ADDRESS_325328] number (a unique identification number) will be assigned via an interactive voice / web response system (IXRS) when a subject signs the ICF and is evaluated for inclusion into the study.  When the subject is eligible for the trial, the study center will send an order (using the IXRS) to the manufacturer for drug shipment based on the planned visit date of the subject.  See Section 6.3.

Isotonic saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection) will be provided by [CONTACT_188528].  Traceability of the respective manufacturers and batches will be maintained in the respective preparation documentation and drug accountability logs. 
The same process must be followed, regardless of treatment arm assignment, to maintain the 
study blind. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Abiraterone acetate 
Abiraterone acetate will be provided with appropriate labeling to each study center by [CONTACT_456]. 
As of Amendment 7, a fter disease progression , abiraterone will be considered standard of 
care (i.e., non- IMP) and will not be supplied as study medication; instead, abiraterone should 
be prescribed locally and recorded on the systemic anti- cancer therapy CRF . 
Abiraterone should be stored at the investigator site.  Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); 
excursions permitted in the range from 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prednisone  / prednisolone  
Prednisone / prednisolone (5-mg tablets) will be provided.  Where prednisone is not commercially available, prednisolone will be provided instead.  
Prednisone should be stored at the investigator site.  Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted in the range from 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).

use of denosumab or bisphosphonates or none, and by [CONTACT_267406] < 90 U/L versus total ALP ≥ 90 U/L.  
The IXRS will provide only the randomization number to the caller, i.e., blinded personnel, but not the assigned treatment.  A confirmation e-mail containing randomization number and treatment will be sent to the unblinded staff member who will be responsible for preparing the study drug for the subject for the first administration.  When the subject is allocated to radium-223 dichloride, the unblinded person will use IXRS to send an order to the manufacturer for drug shipment.  The timing for the drug order should be based on the

contamination, the subject and his caregivers will receive oral and written instructions regarding hygiene precautions to abide by [CONTACT_267407].  These instructions will be 
given to all subjects, as neither the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_267355]-[ADDRESS_325336] be within the tolerance limits of ± 10% of the calculated radioactivity.  
Abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA
®) 1000 mg (four 250- mg tablets) will be administered orally 
once daily in combination with prednisone / prednisolone [ADDRESS_325337] 1 hour after the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken.  The tablets should be swallowed w hole with water 
and should not be crushed or chewed.  If an abiraterone acetate dose is missed, it should be omitted and will not be made up. 
It is not required for the prednisone to be taken at the same time as abiraterone acetate.  The 
dose of prednisone will remain unchanged in the event that the study drug dose is changed.  If a prednisone dose is missed, it should be omitted and will not be made up. 
Based on its mechanism of action, abiraterone acetate may harm a developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]; 
therefore, women who are pregnant or women who may be pregnant should not handle abiraterone acetate without protection, e.g., gloves.  Radium-223 dichloride can be measured in a normal dose calibrator instrument.  When all the required written approvals for the use and handling of radium-223 dichloride from the Radiation Protection Agency / Agencies for the specific center have been received by [CONTACT_456], a vial of radium -223 dichloride for 
technical use will be sent to the study center.

Different clinical study center s possess dose calibrators from various suppliers; thus, the 
isotope calibration factor may differ from center to center.  Consequently, each center must 
perform the radium-223 dial setting on their relevant dose calibrator(s), if no isotope calibration fa ctor for radium -223 is being provided by [CONTACT_240716].  For 
dial setting, the clinical study center will receive a sealed vial or prefilled syringe containing a radium -223 solution for calibration only.  The vial or syringe is identica l to the 
vials  / syringes used for study treatment.  The amount of radium-223 in the vial / syringe will 
be stated on the label.  Instructions for the dial setting, including the calibration log form, will be enclosed with the dispatch of the calibration s ample.

The dose should be ordered through IXRS as soon as possible (i.e., the day of the previous 
dose or a t a minimum the country lead time ) prior to the planned date of administration.  The 
subject’s weight will be submitted with the dose request.  The site is not required to assess safety lab s prior to placing the order. 
Assessments other than weight will be  repeated (as needed to be within the window prior to 
the dose day / time).  The site must obtain safety lab s and review the hematology results 
within 3 days prior to the dose.  If a laboratory result does not meet the criterion for dosing, the radium-223 dichloride dose should not be given; the sponsor is aware this may require the site to waste  / destroy the dose. 
The radium-[ADDRESS_325342] be stored inside their lead container in a secure facility.  The study drug should be used within 28 days of production or prior to the

Control measurements of both the radium-223 dichloride vial (before and after dispensing) and syringes (before and after administration) are performed as part of the clinical trial 
documentation.  Since PRDs will be prepared at the country depot in the US , relevant 
procedures are recorded by [CONTACT_240717].  All administrations of radium-223 dichloride wi ll be based on the certified activity of radium- 223 at the reference date.  Please 
note that all documentation that contains unblinded information should be kept by [CONTACT_240718](s) and not shared with the other study center personnel during the conduct of the study. 
6.4.3 Radium-223 dose calculation 
The dosage of radium-223 dichloride is 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update ) body weight.  The total activity to be injected will be calculated volumetrically using 
the subject’s body weight (kg) within 3  days prior to the injection for non-US sites or 3 to 5 
days prior to the injection for US sites , the 50 kBq/kg (55  kBq/kg after implementation of 
NIST update) dosage level, and the decay correction factor (DK) to correct for physical decay of radium-223.  A table with DKs according to physical decay of the study medication will be provided with each vial / syringe of radium-223 dichloride.  The total amount (volume to be drawn into the syringe) to be administered to a subject should be calculated as follows: 
Body weight (kg) x 50 kBq/kg 
a  = volume to be injected (mL)c 
DK x 1000 kBq/mLb 
a 55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update 
b 1100 kBq/mL after implementation of NIST update 
c The volume to be injected will remain the same before and after implementation of 
the NIST update 
Data regarding activity, calculations, and volume to be injected must be recorded in the subject’s medical record  by [CONTACT_240718]. 
In the US, applicable documentation is required for the country PRD depot.  The subject’s weight will be obtained only once for each dose.  In order to ensure time for the country PRD depot to prepare and deliver the PRDs to the sites : 
• The subject’s weight measured at the dosing visit will be obtained at the site 3 to 5 days prior to the planned dosing date. 
• This weight will be communicated to the country PRD depot for preparation of the current dose along with a prescription and any other details required by [CONTACT_267409]; a record of this information transfer will be retained at the site.  
• Documentation by [CONTACT_267410] a t the depot with a copy provided to the site. 
Subjects at non-US sites should be reweighed on the day of dose administration; the final dose to be administered should be determined using that weight.  Subjects should not be weighed more than once or at different departments on the day of the administration to avoid the potential use of different weights.  Subjects in the US will receive syringe -ready doses

adminis tration.  Therefore, no other weight measurement is needed. 
For subjects in Arm B (placebo injection), the volume of saline to be injected will provided by [CONTACT_240720]’s weight.  Data regarding the saline batch number and the volume to be injected should be recorded on the IMP preparation log and in the eCRF  by 
[CONTACT_229050]. 
6.4.4 Study drug  dose preparation 
In order to keep the treating physician blinded to the assignment of study medication, the unblinded person (e.g., from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267356]) will be 
responsible for blinding the syringe and responsible for calculating the required dosage.  Data regarding activity and volume to be injected should be recorded in the IMP preparation log and in the appropriate eCRF, both of which will not be available to the blinded treating physician or other blinded staff.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_267357].  Additional written instructions for study drug administration, for blinded and unblinded personnel, will be provided. 
Personnel should use appropriate protective clothing and equipment during syringe filling 
and application to prevent contamination with the radioactive solution (lab coats, m edical 
gloves / protective glasses) and to reduce radiation exposure.  Sites should adhere to all relevant radiation safety regulations as prescribed by [CONTACT_240721], including as low as reasonably achievable principles.  
Filling of the syringe should take place in a safety bench or similar cabinet in the radiopharmacy / nuclear medicine department.  The individual responsible for study drug 
preparation will draw the correct volume of study drug into a syringe.  The size of the syringe should be chosen according to the applied volume to reach the required dosing accuracy.  In the US,  a thi rd-party vendor (Cardinal Health) will be used to prepare the injections to be 
used by [CONTACT_5243]. 
Patient ready doses prepared by [CONTACT_267411][INVESTIGATOR_4061].  The measured 
activity of the PRD will be within 10% of the ordered amount (planned dose).  The dose should be ordered through IXRS at least [ADDRESS_325345]’s weight will be submitted with the dose r equest.  The site is not required to assess 
safety labs prior to placing the order.  Assessments other than weight are repeated (as needed to be within the window prior to the dose day / time).  The site must obtain safety labs and review the hematology re sults within [ADDRESS_325346] will be assigned 1 syringe label set, with a unique serial 
number.  The serial number will link the vial / batch  received with the preparation and

Bone pain is a prominent symptom; other symptoms may include fatigue, nausea, anorexia, depression, constipation (also secondary to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]), bowel and bladder symptoms, lymphedema, neurological and hematological complication , as well as metastases to other organs, such as liver and lung. 
The investigator should delay cytotoxic chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotope, hemibody external radiotherapy, or other investigational drug until the subject experiences a SSE.  If such treatments must be given during the treatment period, further study drug 
administrations must be discontinued.  These treatments should not be given before a 4- week 
wash -out period after last administration of study drug, provided the subject’s bone marrow is 
not compromised. 
Recommendations  
Every effort will be made to administer the full dosing regimen.  Single dose level adjustment 
of radium-223 dichloride is not permitted.  Treatment delays or discontinuations of radium-223 dichloride / placebo may be instituted for the AEs described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
and dose adjustments, treatment delays, or discontinuations of abiraterone may be instituted for AEs described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
6.4.6 Dose adjustments, delays, and treatment discontinuations 
Radium-223 dichloride / placebo  administration may be delayed by [CONTACT_23818] 4 weeks 
(maximum 8  weeks between 2 injections) for recovery of AEs.  If treatment is delayed for 
> 4 weeks  (maximum 8 weeks between 2 injections), treatment should be discontinued. 
Treatment wi th abiraterone may be delayed by [CONTACT_23818] 4 weeks for recovery of AEs.  If 
treatment is delayed for > 4 weeks, treatment should be discontinued.  Some AEs as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will lead to a reduction in dose.  No more than 2 reductions in dose are permitted.  If further dose reductions are considered, treatment should be discontinued.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Abiraterone 
Based upon experience from a number of clinical studies, abiraterone acetate is generally 
well tolerated.  
The most common adverse reactions (≥  10%) are fatigue, joint swelling or discomfort, 
edema, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, hypertension, dyspnea, urinary tract infection, and contusion. 
The most common laboratory abnormalities (> 20%) are anemia, elevated ALP , 
hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, elevated AST, 
hypophosphatemia, elevated ALT, and hypokalemia.  It has been documented that following prolonged therapy with corticosteroids, subjects may develop Cushing’s syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_107319], thin skin, easy bruising, and proximal myopathy.  Withdrawal of the corticosteroid may result in symptoms that include fever, myalgia, fatigue, arthralgia, and malaise.  This may occur even without evidence of adrenal insufficiency.  
If dose -reduction is used for AE management, 2 dose reductions are allowed for abiraterone.  
At each dose reduction, one tablet of abiraterone will be removed, e.g., 4→3 tablets and

until the neutrophil count has reached the local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’ s reference ra nge. 
• Neutropenia with fever ( neutrophils / granulocytes CTCAE Grade 3  to 4 
(< 1 x 109/L); fever >  38.5°C):  Blood cultures will be obtained and the subject 
started on empi[INVESTIGATOR_267361].  It is highly 
recommended that the subject receive G -CSF 5  µg/kg/d subcutaneously until the 
neutrophil count has reached the local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’ s reference range with [ADDRESS_325369] 12 hours apart.  
• Severe thrombocytopenia (CTCAE Grade 4 [< 25.0 x 109/L] or bleeding with CT CAE 
Grade 3  to 4 (< 50.0 x 109/L):  Platelets will be transfused to maintain PLT

Unblinding  
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a suspected u nexpected serious 
adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the subject’s treatment code will usually be 
unblinded before reporting to the health authorities, ethic committees (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) if 
the S[LOCATION_003]R was related to the blinded treatment.   Investigators may only unblind subject s 
under emergency unblinding rules.  If a subject is unblinded by [CONTACT_093], they must 
discontinue study drug(s). 
Investigators should note that the occurrence of a SAE or progressive disease (PD) should not 
routinely precipi[INVESTIGATOR_267362].  If emergency unblinding is 
necessary for the treatment of a subject for a SAE, the study treatment can be unblinded via the IXRS (refer to the IXRS manual for instructions). 
The participating site has unrestricted and immediate access to break the treatment code in 
IXRS.  Should the blind code be broken for a subject, the medical monitor or designee should be contact[CONTACT_105564] [INVESTIGATOR_267363]. 
Individual subjects may be unblinded per investigator’ s request  after they have a SSE, 
allowing the investigator to determine if the subject would be a candidate to receive treatment 
with radium-[ADDRESS_325372]- level unblinding information will be communicated to the sites until the 
final OS analysis has been completed. 
Following the IDMC’s recommendation, the study was prematurely unblinded in NOV [ADDRESS_325373] level unblinding information has been communicated to the sites.  
6.6 Drug logistics and accountability 
All study drugs will be stored at the investigational study center in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and GMP requirements and the instructions given by [CONTACT_267412]. 
In some countries  / study centers it will be required to use a third party vendor to prepare the 
injections to be used by [CONTACT_5243].  A log of study medication (received, administered 
to subjects, and destroyed) must be maintained and signed by [CONTACT_267413].  Any labels or mandatory logs provided by [CONTACT_267414].  A copy of study drug documentation will be collected for the sponsor file. 
The responsible study center personnel will use the study drug only within the framework of 
this clinical trial and in accordance with this protocol.  Instructions for drug handling, logistics, and accountability will be reviewed with study staff prior to the initiation of the study.  Summaries of these instructions are provided below. 
For radium -223 dichloride:  
Radium-[ADDRESS_325374].  Lead

08 FEB 2023  Version  no.7.0  Page:   [ADDRESS_325375] be properly documented according to the sponsor’s agreed and specified procedures.  An unblinded monitor will review overall drug accountability and destruction per the study center documentation only.  The remains of radioactivity and contaminated material (i.e., vials, syringes, containers) should be disposed of in accordance with the local regulations and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8829], respectively.  A log of radium-223 dichloride (received, administered to subjects, and destroyed) must be maintained and signed and the appropriate eCRF pages completed by [CONTACT_267415] r. 
For abiraterone and prednisone  / prednisolone : 
Abiraterone and prednisone / prednisolone will be shipped to the study center upon IXRS shipment request.  The responsible site personnel will confirm receipt of sponsor-supplied study drug in writing and / or via IXRS.  A log of this study medication (assigned, dispensed, administered to subjects, returned to site by [CONTACT_1130], and destroyed) must be maintained and signed by [CONTACT_267416].  All study drug packages assigned (opened, unopened, or empty) must be stored until the drug accountability has been completed by [CONTACT_2037].  Based on its mechanism of action, abiraterone acetate may harm a developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]; therefore, women who are pregnant or women who may be pregnant should not handle abiraterone acetate without protection, e.g., gloves. 
For isotonic saline (placebo): Isotonic saline (placebo) will be provided by [CONTACT_1758] c enter pharmacy.  Drug accountability 
for saline will also be performed.  At a minimum, storage conditions, dispensing, batch 
numbers, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_267364].  All study drug packages assigned (opened, unopened, or empty) must be stored until the drug accountability has been completed by [CONTACT_267417] (for saline accountability).  Thereafter, the packages should be disposed in accordance with the local regulations and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8829], respectivel y.  A log of locally provided study medication (assigned, dispensed, 
administered to subjects, returned to study center by [CONTACT_1130], and destroyed) must be maintained and signed by [CONTACT_267418]. 
6.7 Treatment compliance 
Subjects will receive treatment with radium-223 dichloride / placebo under supervision of a physician licensed in the administration of radioisotopes.  Unblinded study personnel will check the administration volume and total radioactivity injected.  The dose activity and the volume injected will be recorded in a study drug log and the eCRF pages, neither of which will be available to the blinded treating physician or blinded site personnel.  Only the unblinded monitor will review overall drug accountability and destruction per the site documentation. 
Daily intake of abiraterone and prednisone / prednisolone will be the responsibility of the 
subject or his at- home caregiver, or clinic staff if the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  Compliance will 
be monitored by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_267365] 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE]

Abiraterone is administered as part of the study therapy.  No other anti-androgen therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (except LHRH  agonists and antagonists , see Secti on 6.9.2) are permitted.  
Subjects receiving bisphosphonates or denosumab prior to randomization may be maintained on such therapy throughout all or part of the study.  The bisphosphonate or denosumab treatment may be stopped at the discretion of the investigator.  Based on the available data on radium-223 dichloride, the option of starting a bone health agent (BHA) including

08 FEB 2023  Version  no.7.0  Page:   58 of 153 
 
bisphosphonates or denosumab should be considered, taking into consideration applicable 
guidelines. 
Other cancer treatment with established efficacy in prostate cancer, including but not limited 
to cytotoxic chemotherapy, estrogens (e.g., stilbestrol), ketoconazole, other systemic radioisotope or hemibody external radiotherapy, or other investigational drugs, should not be used during the treatment period.  If such treatments are considered to be the best standard of care during the treatm ent period, further study drug administrations must be discontinued and 
the subject should enter the active follow-up period. 
All medication for the clinical benefit or supportive care for the subject may be provided at 
the discretion of the investigator. 
Note that all treatments for prostate cancer, including other investigational drugs taken after 
withdrawal from treatment with radium-223 dichloride or placebo, will be recorded in the eCRFs until the end of the active follow-up period without clinic visit s. 
The following concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_267366], between 
randomization and the start of treatment, and during the treatment phase of the study: 
• Systemic glucocorticoids, unless clinically indicated to treat a life -threatening acute 
medical condition 
• 5 α-reductase inhibitor 
• Chemotherapy 
• Immunotherapy, e.g., sipuleucel -T 
• Bicalutamide, nilutamide, flutamide, enzalutamide  
• Systemic ketoconazole (or other azole drugs such as fluconazole and itraconazole) 
• Diethylstilbestrol, PC -SPES, and other preparations such as saw palmetto thought to 
have endocrine effects on prostate cancer  
• Radiopharmaceuticals such as strontium-89 or samarium-153 
• Aldactone, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_267367] (spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407]) 
• Digoxin, digitoxin, and other digitalis drugs 
• Cyproterone acetate  
• Fludrocortisone acetate (Florinef)  
Please note the following cautions : 
• Caution is advised when abiraterone acetate is administered with drugs activated by [CONTACT_267419]2D6, particularly with drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index.  Dose reduction of narrow therapeutic index drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6 should be considered. 
• Strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], rifabutin, 
rifapentine, phenobarbital) during treatment with abiraterone acetate are to be avoided.

08 FEB 2023  Version  no.7.0  Page:   59 of 153 
 
• Abiraterone inhibits CYP2C8 in vitro.  Subjects should be monitored closely for signs 
of toxicity related to the CYP2C8 substrate if used concomitantly with abiraterone 
acetate. 
During follow-up, radium-223 dichloride should not be given concurrently w ith abiraterone 
plus prednisone/prednisolone. 
6.9.2 Permitted concomitant therapy 
The following supportive care medications are considered permissible  during the study: 
• LHRH agonists or antagonists to maintain testosterone <  50 ng/dL (< 1.7 nmol/L) 
• Conventional multivitamins, selenium, and soy supplements 
• Additional systemic glucocorticoid administration such as “stress dose” 
glucocorticoid is permitted if clinically indicated for a life threatening medical condition, and in such cases, the use of steroids will be documented as concomitant drug. 
• Bisphosphonates or denosumab usage is allowed.  Based on the available data on 
radium-223 dichloride, the option of starting a BHA including bisphosphonates or denosumab should be considered, taking into consideration applicable guidelines. 
• Blood transfusions and treatment with erythropoietin stimulating agents  are allowed 
after randomization (if required to ensure that the treatment range for Hb ≥  8.0 g/dL 
is met at Day 1 of each cycle) but not within 4 weeks prior to screening and during the screening period. 
• Use of biologic response modifiers, such as G- CSF or GM -CSF, is allowed in the 
management of acute toxicity , such as febrile neutropenia, when clinically indicated 
or at the discretion of the investigator. 
• Analgesic use will be captured via electronic patient- report ed outcome ( ePRO ) device 
and the eCRF (analgesic consumption diary and recorded analgesics, respectively, 
see schedule of assessments , Table 7 –1).  Subjects will be asked to track their 
analgesic use on an ePRO  / analgesic consumption diary for 1 week prior to their 
clinic visit (6 days prior to the visit plus the day of the visit).  Each day the pain 
question is asked of the subject, the subject should be asked to record any pain medication they took that day.  Any medication taken for pain, whether for palliation of bone pain or relief of other type of pain, and any changes should be recorded in the eCRF at each visit.  Note that analgesic medication should be recorded in the eCRF until the end of the treatment period while EBRT  treatment should be 
recorded in the eCRFs  until end of the active follow -up period without clinic visits.

and has signed and dated the ICF.  No treatment or trial- related procedures will be initiated 
before the signed consent has been obtained.  Imaging may be done before obtaining informed consent if done routinely.  Subjects will not be required to undergo additional scanning if suitable images taken within [ADDRESS_325395] health status, including blood values, will be recorded in the eCRF.  
The following procedure and evaluations will be performed within 2 weeks (+ 7 days) prior to randomization: 
• Sign informed consent 
• Subject registration and subject number assignment via IXRS 
• Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria and confirm eligibility  
• Demographics 
• Record disease history  
• Record medical history  
• Record AEs

• A multi-gated acquisition ( MUGA) scan or a cardiac echocardiogram ( ECHO ) should 
be obtained.  A MUGA scan or cardiac ECHO taken within 4 weeks prior to 
randomization is acceptable.  
• A ches t / abdominal / pelvic CT if no suitable images taken within 4 weeks prior to 
randomization are available.  (Chest  / abdominal / pelvic MRI will be accepted in 
place of chest  / abdominal / pelvic CT)  
• Bone technetium -99m scan with careful identification of all disease -related hotspots, if 
no scan taken within 4 weeks prior to randomization is available.  Any confirmatory scan such as single photon emission tomography (SPECT) or MRI (with and without contrast media) should be obtained or collected if performed within 4 weeks of randomization. 
• Blood draw for clinical chemistry:  sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, ALT, AST, 
LDH, total ALP, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), bilirubin (total) , and 
albumin  
• Serum testosterone

questionnaires and the analgesic consumption diary and should receive training in its use. 
• Record SSEs during the screening period.  The investigator will assess the subjec t for 
the following disease events: 
o Use of EBRT to relieve skeletal symptoms  
o New symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral and non- vertebral)  
o Tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention 
o Spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377] 
• Record survival status 
The following procedures and evaluations should be performed within 1 week prior to randomization unless infeasible (a 2 -week maximum timeframe is permitted).  Results must 
be available, reviewed, and signed and dated by [CONTACT_98653]. 
• Blood draw for hematology:  hematocrit, Hb, PLT, red blood cell (RBC) counts, WBC  
counts, and WBC differential .  If any values are low, transfusions or bone marrow 
growth factors support are permitted as described in Section 6.9.2. 
• A coagulation panel :  PT, PTT, and INR.  Subject s treated with warfarin or heparin 
will be allowed to participate in the study if no underlying abnormality in coagulation parameters exists p er prior history; weekly evaluation of PT- INR / PTT will be 
required until stability is achieved (as defined by [CONTACT_267401]-study PT- INR / PTT values)

The following should occur 3 to 5 days prior to dosing: 
• For US sites using the central PRD depot ONLY, the subject weight for the dose day 
must be reported in a timely manner to the country PRD depot to allow adequate time 
for PRD preparation and delivery.  All efforts should be made to measure weight at the same visit with the pre -dose laboratory assessments in order to avoid 2 pre -dose 
clinic visits.  
Important Note:  If rescreening is indicated, it must be completed with approval from the medical monitor of the sponsor.  No more than one rescreening attempt will be allowed for each subject.  Please refer to Section 5.1 for further guidance on cases in which rescreening is allowed and the time window for rescreening. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Randomization 
Randomization in the IXRS may occur only after the completion of the screening evaluations and re-confirmation of subject eligibility.  Randomization may coincide with the end of a screening visit if all evaluations are complete; otherwise, randomization may be performed in a separate clinic visit.  Once the subject is registered in  IXRS, the initial drug shipment will 
be triggered.  In the US, Cycle 1, Day [ADDRESS_325396] 7 days after randomization, whenever possible. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment period 
The treatment period extends from the day of first treatment with radium-223 dichloride / placebo  to [ADDRESS_325397] the final abiraterone as IMP and prednisone / prednisolone treatment. 
The time between randomization and first injection should be as brief as possible in accordance with the country -specific drug order lead time. 
During the treatmen t period, the subject will visit the study center at regular intervals.  
Radium-223 dichloride / placebo  will be injected at 4 -week intervals for 6 cycles on an 
out-patient basis  (Section 7.1).  Abiraterone and prednisone / prednisolone will be taken 
orally on a daily basis. 
It is the responsibility of the unblinded person to calculate the required volume of 
radioactivity (i.e., dose of radium-223 dichloride or saline placebo) for the subject based on the subject’s body weight within 3 days prior to administration  for non- US s ites and 3 to 
5 days prior to administration for US sites and the reference date of the received study medication  (Section 6.4.3).  
For US sites using the central PRD depot ONLY, the subject weight for the dose day must be reported to the country PRD depot in a timely manner to allow adequate time for the PRD preparation and delivery.  All efforts should be made to measure weight at the same visit with the pre-dose laboratory assessments in order to avoid 2 pre -dose clinic visits.  
Before administration of radium-223 dichloride / placebo , the subject must be well hydrated; 
thus, the subject should be instructed to drink ad libitum .  The b lood samples for clinical 
chemistry and hematology should be taken within [ADDRESS_325398] be evaluated before each study drug administration (within 3 days).  The Hb level should not be lower than 8.0 g/dL within 3 days  before any injection.

study drug and should go directly into the active follow -up period without clinic visits, and may 
then be transfused if needed.  
Between study drug administrations , if Hb levels are below 8 g/dL, the Hb needs to recover to 
8.0 g/dL or higher before next study drug administration.  If there is more than a 4- week delay in 
the next injection (i.e., more than 8 weeks between injections), the study drug should be 
permanently discontinued and the subject should enter the active follow -up period without clinic 
visits.  Treatment of low Hb is acceptable between study drug administr ations.

assessment interval requires completion of a minimum of [ADDRESS_325415] not progressed.  Subjects with no on-study assessment or no baseline assessment will be censored at the d ate of randomization.  The BPI -SF 
(Section  14.9) is a short, self-administered questionnaire with 11 items, which was designed 
to evaluate the intensity of, and the impairment caused by [CONTACT_77368].  All BPI- SF items are scored 
using rating scales.  Four items measure pain intensity (pain now, average pain, worst pain, and least pain) using 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“pain as bad as you can imagine”) numeric rating scales, and 7 items measure the level of interference with function caused by [CONTACT_77368] (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life) using 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference) rating scales.  
The items are aggregated into 2 dimensions :  (1) Pain severity index, using the mean of the 
4 items on the pain intensity, and (2) Function interference index, using the mean of the [ADDRESS_325416] be completed for aggregating the pain severity index.

7.4 Pharmacokinetics (selected sites only) 
Note: Pharmacokinetic data will not be assessed following final OS analysis.  
7.4.1 Drug measurement  
Pharmacokinetics of radium-223 dichloride will not be evaluated in this study; however, the 
PK of abiraterone will be investigated in 2 subgroups.  In each subgroup, 40 subjects (approximately 20 per treatment arm) will be enrolled.  Blood samples will be collected at pre-defined times as specified below. 
The following time ranges are provided: 
• for planned time points ≤  6 hours, PK samples should be collected within ± 15 minutes 
of the planned time 
• for planned time points > 6 hours, PK samples should be collected within ± 30 minutes 
Subgroup 1  (Non -compartmental analysis):  
Serial blood samples will be collected at the following time points:  Pre -dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
6, 8, 10, and [ADDRESS_325427] or second 
administration of radium-223 dichloride / placebo  (collection on Cycle 1, Day 8 or Cycle 2, 
Day 8). 
Sampling times outside these suggested intervals will not be considered to be protocol 
deviations.  It is of importance that th e actual date and time of blood sampling are 
documented in the eCRF because PK calculations will be based on the actual sampling times relative to dosing times.  
Subgroup 2  (Population PK analysis):  
Blood samples will be collected prior to the abiraterone a dministration at Cycle 1, Day s 8 and 
15 (Visit 3) and Cycle 2, Days 1 (Visit 4) , 8, and 15  (Visit 5) .  In addition, a second blood 
sample will be collected at each of these visits within the time window of 0.[ADDRESS_325428] 
abiraterone administration.  
Plasma will be prepared from the collected blood samples and analyzed using a validated analytical metho d for abiraterone.  
Special Meal Instruction:  
For the [ADDRESS_325429] (approximately 
10 hours) before taking abiraterone.  Subjects should not eat until 1 hour after abiraterone dosing.  Food intake prior to the PK fasting periods should be recor ded in the eCRF.  
Detailed instructions for sample collection and handling will be provided in a Laboratory Manual.  
7.4.2 Pharmacokinetic evaluation  
Subgroup 1:  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using a non -compartment approach.  Based on 
the plasma concentration time data, the following PK parameters will be calculated for 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

dichloride / placebo : 
• Maximum concentration at a steady state  
• Time to maximum concentration at a steady -state 
• Area under the curve from zero to 24 hours 
Subgroup 2:  
A population PK analysis of plasma concentration- time data of abiraterone will be performed 
to assess the similarity or difference in PK of abiraterone between subjects treated with radium-223 dichloride plus abiraterone and prednisone / prednisolone and placebo plus abiraterone and prednisone / prednisolone using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling.  The population PK modeling will include all subjects with s ufficient and interpretable PK 
assessments.  The data from Subgroup [ADDRESS_325431] one dose of study drug will be valid for safety analysis.  All 
AEs will be reported and graded according to NCI- CTCA E v4.0.  Laboratory evaluations, 
vital signs, and changes in physical examination findings will also be assessed. 
7.5.1 Adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions 
Adverse event  
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom, or disease) in a patient or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study.  Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product. 
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by [CONTACT_209561] (however, the condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE). 
The clinical manifestation of any failure of expected pharmacological action is not recorded as an AE  if it is already reflected as a data point captured in the eCRF.   If, however, the event 
fulfills any of the criteria for a SAE (see  below) then it must be recorded and reported as 
such.  If PD leads to signs and symptoms that meet the serious criteria (i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023 Version  no. 7.0 Page:   88 of 153 
 
disability, death , or important medical event), the signs and symptoms must be reported as a 
SAE and not the underlying disease (i.e., PD). 
Adverse event versus medical history  
In the following differentiation between medical history and AEs, the term “condition” may 
include abnormal physical examination findings, symptoms, diseases, laboratory findings, or scans.  
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms 
or treatment are present until signing of informed consent are considered as medical 
history  (e.g., seasonal allergy without acute complaints).  
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity, are considered as medical history  (e.g., allergic pollinosis).  
• Symptoms that were present prior to signing of informed consent but for which the 
diagnosis was confirmed after signing of informed consent should be documented as medical history . 
• Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events .  
Serious adverse event  
An SAE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the following criteria (a  – f):  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening 
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
c. Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267373] a SAE if at least one of the following exceptions is met: 
• The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours 
• The admission is pre-planned  (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study) 
• The admission is not associated with an AE  (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]). 
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39675] ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as a SAE dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precede nce.

08 FEB 2023 Version  no. 7.0 Page:   89 of 153 
 
d. Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity  
Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s 
functions. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect 
f. Is another medically important serious event as judged by [CONTACT_093] 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Classifications for adverse event assessment 
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_8970].  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_325432] be determined according to the criteria given in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Intensity 
The intensity of an AE should be documented using the NCI-CTCAE v4.03, JUN 2010.   
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Causal relationship 
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment 
is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the eCRF.  The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal 
relationship” to the study treatment in question. 
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”  
An assessment of “no” would include: 
• The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g. , mechanical bleeding at surgical 
study center. 
Or 
• Non-plausibility (e.g., the subject is struck by [CONTACT_23634]; cancer developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few days after the first drug administration). 
An assessment of “yes” indicates that there is a reas onable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_267374]. 
Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment 
include: 
• The temporal sequence from drug administration:  The event should occur after the drug 
is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Recovery on drug discontinuation (de-challenge), recurrence on drug re-introduction (re-challenge):  Subject’s response after de- challenge or subject ’s response after 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023 Version  no. 7.0 Page:   90 of 153 
 
re-challenge should be considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in 
question. 
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:  Each event should be evaluated in the 
context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
• Concomitant medication or treatment:  The other drugs the subject is taking or the 
treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them may 
be suspected to cause the event in question. 
• The pharmacology and PK of the study treatment:  The PK properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study treatment, coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacodynamics should be considered. 
Causal relationship to protocol- required procedure(s)  
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol-required procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to protocol- required procedure(s). Possible answers are “yes” or “no”  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Action taken with study treatment 
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories listed below.  
- Drug withdrawn 
- Drug interrupted 
- Dose reduced  
- Dose not changed 
- Not applicable 
- Unknown 
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events 
- None 
- Remedial drug therapy

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessments and documentation of adverse events 
A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant (e.g., causing the subject to 
withdraw from the trial), requiring treatment, causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged as relevant by [CONTACT_118017].  Each  event should be 
described in detail along with start and stop dates (onset and resolution of event), intensity, temporal and causal relationship to investigational product and / or protocol- related 
procedures, possible alternative factors (co -morbidities,  co-medications), therapeutic action 
taken, result of therapeutic action, and ultimate outcome of the AE. 
All (S)AEs, regardless of grade or relatedness, that occur during the treatment period and up 
to [ADDRESS_325433] administration of abiraterone as IMP and prednisone / prednisolone 
or [ADDRESS_325434] administration of radium-223 dichloride / placebo , whichever 
occurs later , unless a new anti- cancer therapy is initiated,  must be reported in the appropriate 
eCRF (SAEs must be reported within  24 hrs of the investigator’s awareness).  If more than 
one AE occurs, each event should be recorded separately .  All AEs and SAEs are to be 
followed until resolved or as clinically required. 
All AEs and SAEs occurring a fter the EOT  visit until the EOS  must be documented and 
reported if considered to be related to study medication.  However, all occurrences of 
leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, and primary bone cancer or any other new primary malignancy must be reported as SAEs at any time, and regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment . 
All bone fractures and bone associated events (e.g., osteoporosis) need to be repor ted as
  
either AEs or SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met, regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment.  All the imaging scans that confirmed the diagnosis of fractures should be sent to 
the independent review center for central review . 
Adverse events may be reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_240739] (non-le
ading) questioning during each visit to the clinic and at the end of the active follow-up 
period without clinic visits.  As far as possible, all AEs must be described by [CONTACT_240740] (start and stop date), severity (graded according to the CTCAE), relationship to treatment, and according to the need of other specific therapy.  All information will be recorded in the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Note: After Amendment 7, scans will only be read locally. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of serious adverse events 
The definition of SAEs is given in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Each SAE must be followed up until resolution or stabilization by [CONTACT_23636][INVESTIGATOR_841].  
If disease progression leads to signs and symptoms that meet the criteria for seriousness, the associated signs and symptoms should be reported as SAE, not the underlying cause (i.e., “progressive disease” should not be recorded as SAE).  In thi s case, disease progression 
should be mentioned on the SAE form as “alternative explanation.”

SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met, regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment. All the imaging scans that confirmed the diagnosis of fractures should be sent to the independent review center for central review. Grade 4 baseli ne laboratory abnormalities that 
are part of the disease profile should not be reported as a SAE, specifically when they are allowed or not excluded by [CONTACT_39719] / exclusion criteria.   If an investigator is in 
doubt about the applicable reporting obligations, he / she should consult with the medical monitor. 
For subjects who die after the treatment  period defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS], submission of the 
AE page of the eCRF is not required.  However, the SAE Complementary Form should be

[IP_ADDRESS]  Urine, serum, and plasma based biomarker analysis 
Blood samples will be obtained from all subjects at the following time points:  Cycle 1 , Day  1 
(Visit 2 ), Cycle 4 , Day 1 (Visit 8 ), Cycle 7, Day 1 (i.e., [ADDRESS_325445] dose of radium-223 
dichloride / placebo), Cycle 13, Day 1, and at EOT or disease progression, whichever occurs 
first.  Urine samples will be collected  on Cycle 1, Day 1 (Visit 2), Cycle 4, Day 1 (Visit 8), 
Cycle 7, Day 1, and at EOT or disease progression, whichever occurs first . 
Urine and serum from blood samples (Cycle 1,  Day 1, Cycle 4, Day 1, Cycle 7, Day 1 [i.e., 
[ADDRESS_325446] dose of radium-223 dichloride / placebo], and EOT / disease progression) 
may be evaluated for expression levels of bone-related biomarkers.  Elevated levels of bone biomarkers are indicative for e.g., more aggressive disease and are prognostic of worse long-term clinical outcome.  In this study, levels of bone biomarkers (measured before, during, and after treatment) that are indicative of bone remodeling (e.g., ALP  and bone ALP ) and bone 
resorption (e.g., n-telopeptide, c-telopeptide, carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen, procollagen I N-terminal propeptide, and osteocalcin) may be evaluated and correlated with 
clinical outcomes (including SSEs , survival, and levels of other biomarkers). 
In addition, serum and plasma samples (Cycle 1 , Day 1, Cycle 13, Day 1, and EOT / disease 
progression) may be used to analyze levels of circulating messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) / micro -ribonucleic acid ( miRNA ) and anomalies of tumor- related genes.  Analyses 
will not include germline genetic mutations.  The genes of interest will include genes in androgen  / androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis (AR and its splice variants, AR- regulated 
genes, cell cycle genes, steroidogenic genes, etc.) and other genes relevant to abiraterone resistance or prostate cancer.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor based biomarker analysis 
Archival formali n-fixed, paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tumor samples will be requested from all 
subjects .  If a tissue block cannot be sent, unstained slides containing FFPE  tumor tissue will 
be accepted.  
Requests to return any unused tumor tissue material at study completion will be honored.  
Tumor tissue may be used for global or targeted mRNA and miRNA expression profiling.  
The genes of interest will include genes in androgen / AR signaling axis or other genes relevant to abiraterone resistance or prostate cancer.  Data fro m expression profiling of 
mRNA and miRNA may be compared to data obtained from prior studies, e.g., in chemotherapy -naïve CRPC, newly-diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer (M1), or primary 
prostate cancer to identify RNA profiles that correlate with clinica l outcome.  Data may also 
be combined from similar data collected in other studies to further characterize the diverse biology of prostate cancer with the anticipation that the disease may be segmented into major subtypes. 
In addition, tumor- related DNA an alysis, such as targeted or whole exome sequencing of 
tumor DNA, may be performed to characterize somatic anomalies that are associated with 
clinical outcome to abiraterone or to prognosis of prostate cancer. 
Detailed instructions for sample collection and  handling will be provided in a Laboratory 
Manual.

7.7 Appropriateness of procedures / measurements 
The procedures chosen for the evaluation of safety in this study population are consistent 
with the appropriate and ethical standards used in phase III trials of oncology drugs. 
Procedures and variables following OS analysis are appropriate for safety follow-up and 
limited efficacy.  
8. Statistical methods and determination of sample size  
8.1 General considerations 
Subjects will be randomized to radium-223 dichloride or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  Randomization will be stratified by:  
• Geographical regions (Western Europe / North America  / Australia v ersus  Asia versus  
rest of world)  
• Concurrent use of denosumab or bisphosphonates or none 
• Total ALP < 90 U/L versus total ALP ≥ 90 U/L  
To prevent sparse data, strata for current use of denosumab and current use of bisphosphonates will be combined in all stratified analysis for this study.  
Exploratory analysis of the primary variable will be performed for each subgroup for individual stratification factors.  
Statistical analysis will be performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS); the version used will be specified in the SAP.  Analysis details for all efficacy and safety endpoints will be specified in the SAP.  
8.2 Analysis sets  
The following 3 populations will be analyzed: 
Intent -to-treat:   All randomized subjects.  The ITT population will be used in the analysis of 
all efficacy endpoints.  Subjects will be included in all ITT analyses according to the 
treatment to which they are  randomized. 
Safety:  All randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of any study drug.  This safety population will be used in the analyses of all safety endpoints.  Subjects will be included in the analyses according to the treatment they received.  
PK set:   All subjects in Subgroup 1 with a valid PK profile for abiraterone will be included in 
the PK  set. 
8.3 Efficacy variables 
Definition  for each variable is  given in Section 7.3. 
The primary efficacy variable is SS E-FS.  
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023 Version  no. 7.0 Page:   97 of 153 
 
The secondary efficacy variables following final OS analysis are specified below:  
• OS 
No other secondary  and exploratory efficacy variables will be assessed following final OS 
analysis.  
8.4 Statistical and analytical plans 
8.4.1 Primary efficacy analysis 
The overall 2-sided t ype I error rate for the analysi s of primary efficacy endpoint SSE- FS is 
0.05. 
The hypotheses to be tested are: 
H0:  S Radium-223 dichloride = S Placebo 
Ha:  S Radium- 223 dichloride ≠ S Placebo,  
where S is the survival distribution. 
The SSE -FS will be analyzed using a stratified log -rank test with the  same stratification  
factors as for  randomization.  The HR  (radium -223 dichloride / placebo) will be computed 
together with the 2-sided 95% CI using a Cox regression model stratified by [CONTACT_267432].  
Kaplan -Meier estimates and plots for both treatment groups will be produced to accompany 
these analyses.  
Additional details for the analyses of primary efficacy endpoint will be provided in the SAP. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_325447], with the factors from the randomization used for stratification.  An HR with a 95% CI  
from a stratified Cox proportional hazards model will also be provided.   Kaplan -Meier plots 
will be produced to accompany these analyses. 
8.4.3 Safety analysis 
Safety variables will be analyzed using frequency tables and descriptive statistics. 
8.4.4 Pharmacokinetic data 
No pharmacokinetic data will be assessed following final OS analysis. Statistical analysis will be done only for Subgroup 1; Subgroup 2 PK analysis results will be 
presented in a separate report.  
The concentration- time courses of abiraterone will be tabulated separated by [CONTACT_3148].  The 
following statistics will be calculated for each of the sampling points:  arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV); geometric mean, geometric SD 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023 Version  no. 7.0 Page:   98 of 153 
 
(re-transformed SD of the logarithms), and CV; minimum, median, maximum value, and the 
number of measurements.  
Means at any time will only be calculated if at least 2/3 of the individual data were measured 
and were above the lower limit of quanti fication (LLOQ).  For the calculation of the mean 
value, a data point below LLOQ will be substituted by [CONTACT_221746].  In tables showing mean values, where values below LLOQ are included in the calculation of mean values, these means will be marked.  
Individual and geometric mean concentration versus time curves of abiraterone (using the actual sampling times for individual plots and the planned sampling times for mean plots) will be plotted by [CONTACT_267433] a linear and semilogarithmic scale.  
Pharmacokinetic characteristics (t
max exclude d) will be summarized by [CONTACT_267434].  The t max will be described utilizing minimum, maximum, and median as 
well as frequency counts.  
8.5 Planned interim analyses 
There is no formal interim analysis  for efficacy  planned for the primary endpoint SSE- FS. 
For the secondary efficacy endpoint of OS, one interim analysis (to be performed at the same time as the final SSE -FS analysis) and one final  analysis are planned.   At the interim OS 
analysis, it is expected that [ADDRESS_325448] occurred (assuming 35.3 months median 
survival in the control arm).  If the analysis of OS after 275 deaths following treatment with radium-223 dichloride plus abiraterone plus prednisone / prednisolone is statistically significantly be tter compared to control (p ≤ 0.0015, based on O’Brien -Fleming alpha 
spending function), then OS will be declared positive for the interim analysis, assuming the final event number for OS is 500.  The actual nominal alpha levels will be calculated based on the actual number of events accrued at the OS interim analysis .  If the interim OS analysis 
is not statistically significant, the final  analysis for OS will be performed when approximately 
[ADDRESS_325449] occurred, corresponding to an approximately 60% power to detect a 25% improvement (in OS with radium-223 dichloride compared with placebo) with a 2-sided alpha of 0.025. 
Planned updated analysis  
A descriptive updated analysis will be performed after last  subject last visit  has occurred.   
Data may be reported through listings.  
8.[ADDRESS_325450] with a 2-sided 
alpha of 0.05, power of 90%, and a randomization ratio of 1:1 between the experimental 
(radi um-223 dichloride) and control (placebo) arms, [ADDRESS_325451] a 39% 
increase in SSE -FS (i.e., an overall 0.[ADDRESS_325452] has approximately 90% 
power to detect a difference between the 2 SSE -FS curves if the alternative h ypothesis HR is 
0.72 [assuming the median SSE-FS is 29.2 months for radium-223 dichloride versus  21.0 for 
control]).  The expected study duration for SSE- FS is 37  months, assuming subjects enroll at

BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023 Version  no. 7.0 Page:   99 of 153 
 
a rate of 50 subjects per month, an enrollment ramp-up time of 9 months, a dropout rate of 
10%, exponentially distributed event time, 21 months in SSE-FS median time for the control group, and a total of 800 subjects in the 2 treatment groups combined. 
This study is also powered (~60%) for the analysis of OS.  For the concluding analysis of OS, 
[ADDRESS_325453] is randomized, assuming the median OS for the control arm is 35.3 months and a 25% improvement for the radium-223 dichloride arm.  If the final analysis of OS after 500 deaths 
reveals that the experimental treatment is statistically significantly better than treatment with control (p ≤ 0.0245), then the OS endpoint will be declared positive for the final analysis.  
9. Data handling and qualit y assurance  
9.[ADDRESS_325454] will be used at the study center to identify the source data for all data points collected and the monitor will work with the study center to complete this.  
Data recorded from “only screened subjects (screening failures)”  
Data of ‘only screened subjects’ will be recorded at least as source data, as far as the reason for the premature discontinuation is identifiable.  At minimum, data to be recorded in the eCRF are demographic information (subject number, date of birth / age, sex, and, if allowed by [CONTACT_1295], race and ethnicity), the reason for premature discontinuation and date of last visit.  These data will be transferred to the respective database.  
For screening failures with a SAE, the following additional data should be collected in the eCRF, in addition to demographic information, primary reason for discontinuation and date of last visit:  
• All information about the SAE 
• All information related to the SAE such as: 
− Concomitant medication  
− Medical history  
− Other information needed for SAE complementary page 
9.2 Monitoring 
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor’s / CRO’s  procedures, monitors 
will contact [CONTACT_267435], study requirements, and their responsi bilities to satisfy regulatory, ethical, and 
sponsor’s requirements.  When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also include identification and documentation of source data items.

relocation or transfer of ownership). 
The Investigator Site file is not to be destroyed without the sponsor’s approval. The contract with the investigator / institution will contain all regulations relevant for the 
study center.  
10. Premature termination of the study  
The sponsor has the right to close this study (or, if applicable, individual segments thereof [e.g., treatment arms; dose steps; centers]) at any time, which may be due but not limited to the following reasons: 
• If risk -benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example, 
o Safety findings from this study (e.g., SAEs), upon the recommendation of the IDMC  
o Results of any interim analysis which might be necessary after the study begins 
o Results of parallel clinical studies  
o Results of parallel animal studies (e.g., toxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity , or reproduction toxicity). 
• If the study conduct (e.g., recruitment rate; drop -out rate; data quality; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper compl etion of the trial within a reasonable 
time frame.  
The investigator has the right to close his / her center at any time.  
For any of the above closures, the following applies: 
• Closures should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  Final 
decision on the closure must be in writing. 
• All affected institutions (e.g. , IEC[s] / IRB[s]; competent authority [ies]; study center; 
head of study center) must be informed as applicable according to local law. 
• All study materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at study center) 
must be returned to the sponsor or (for radium-223 dichloride samples) be destroyed at the study center in accordance with the local radioprotection regulations.  The Investigator will retain all oth er documents until notification given by [CONTACT_267436]. 
• In case of a partial study closure, ongoing subjects, including those in post study 
follow- up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.

13.2 Amendment 2   
Amendment 2 (dated 12 JUN  2015) is an amendment to Integrated  Protocol version 2.0 dated 
26 AUG 2014. Changes to the integrated protocol include: 
• Update dosing and dose calibration  of radium-[ADDRESS_325513] 
standardization for radium-223 
• Removed cytological confirmation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate from inclusion 
criteria; histological confirmation only  
• Clarified that the treatment period ended when a subject received abiraterone/prednisone as the standard of care (non- IMP) after an SSE  
• Added an exclusion for immunotherapy (e.g., sipuleucel- T) within [ADDRESS_325514] dose of radium-223 dichloride 
• Clarified duration of prohibited concomitant therapy is from Screening onwards 
• Clarified  potassium requirement for ECG collection  
• Editorial updates 
13.2.[ADDRESS_325515]. 
Rationale : 
The quantification of radium-223 radioactivity in Xofigo® is based on the primary 
standardization performed by [CONTACT_194650] (NIST).  
The NIST Standard Reference Material is used to calibrate the instruments in production and quality control of both the drug substance and drug product.  Additionally, the calibrated instruments in production at the Institute for Energy Technology (Norway) are used to prepare the NIST traceable radium -223 reference material, which are then sent to the 
treatment sites (e.g., nuclear medicine laboratory physicians or technicians) for dial  setting of 
their dose calibrators, to allow verification of the subject  dose.  A reassessment of the 
primary standardization was initiated by [CONTACT_194651].  A discrepancy of approximately 10% between the published NIST primary standardization (55) and current measurements was confirmed and a revised NIST primary reference standard has been issued (56).  As a result of the revised NIST primary standardization, an adaption of the numerical description of subject  dose and the description of radioactive concentration of the drug product solution 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol  
BAY 88 -8223 / [ZIP_CODE] 
08 FEB 2023 Version  no. 7.0 Page:   127 of 153 
 
becomes necessary.  This concerns Xofigo® for commercial use and product used in clinical 
trials.   
After the implementation of the new standard ( 56), the numerical description of the subject  
dose will be adjusted from 50 kBq/kg to 55 kBq/kg, and the numerical description of the 
radioactivity in the vial will be changed from 1,000 kBq/mL to 1,100 kBq/mL.  A respective variation application and substantial amendment to our Clinical Trial Applications  have been 
initiated.   The current standard (55), dial setting , and dose will remain in effect until a unique 
implementation date in Q2 [ADDRESS_325516] date of implementation prior to the effective date.  
Justification for changing the dose to 55 kBq/kg body weight : 
A systematic approximately 10% error in the radium-[ADDRESS_325517] standardization (55) means that the current subject  dose and the dose documented as safe and efficacious throughout 
development is 55 kBq/kg body weight and not 50 kBq/kg body weight as declared during clinical trials and in the marketing authorization application / new drug application.  However, as this is a systematic error, the actual dose has been the same all the time.  In order to keep the actual dose for subjects identical to what has been documented and administered so far, also when implementing the new official standard, the nominal value of the subject  
dose will be changed to 55 kBq/kg body weight (56).  This change keeps the same accuracy in the nominal value of the dose.  Thus, there will be no actual change in the subject  dose 
(amount of radioactivity); it will be only a change in the dose nominal value when corrected according to the new official radium-[ADDRESS_325518].  All sites will continue to use the current dial setting ( 55) for the activity measurements until the implementation date in Q2 
2016. 
Justification for changing the description of the radioactivity in the vial to 
1,100 kBq/mL : 
A systematic approximately 10% error in the radium-[ADDRESS_325519] (55) means that the Xofigo
® solution for injection with a radioactivity concentration claim of 1,000 kBq/mL, 
which has been tested in pi[INVESTIGATOR_240683], actually has a concentration of 1,100 kBq/mL.  If the drug product concentration is adjusted to 1,100 kBq/mL, the total activity in the vial (6 mL) must be changed from 6,000 kBq/vial to 6,600 kBq/vial (changed from 6.0 MBq/vial to 6.6 MBq/vial in many countries).  Xofigo
® 
solution for injection produced according to the new NIST standardization (56), is the same product as before.  NOTE:  All product received by [CONTACT_267438] 1000 kBq/mL until the implementation date in Q2 2016.   
Now that the new radium-[ADDRESS_325520] dose in treatment sites has to be performed using updated dial settings of dose calibrators.

NOTE :  Throughout this docum ent, the dose of radium-223 dichloride is given as 50 kBq/kg, 
which is based on the original NIST standardization (55); however, when NIST issues the 
updated radium-223 dichloride standardization, the dose administered will actually be 55 kBq/kg (based on a change to the reference standard [56] only), though the volume of radium-[ADDRESS_325523] will remain the same.

13.4 Amendment 6  
Amendment 6 (dated 03 APR 2018) i s an amendment to Integrated Protocol Version 4.0, 
dated 13 SEP 2016. Changes to the integrated protocol include: 
• New request  that bone fractures and bone associated events (e.g., osteoporosis) need to 
be reported as (S)AEs , including during long- term follow-up, regardless of the 
investigator’s causality assessment. 
• Addition of independent radiological review of fractures. 
• Based on the available data on radium-223 dichloride, i nitiation of BHA is now 
allowed . 
• Addition that radium-223 dichloride should not be given in combination with abiraterone plus prednisone/prednisolone during follow-up. 
• Additional minor clarifications . 
13.4.1  Overview of changes 
Rationale: 
The study was unblinded early based on the IDMC recommendation according to an ad hoc 
independent analysis where more treatment emergent fractures, SSE -FS, and total deaths 
events were observed in the active treatment arm compared with the placebo arm. Bas ed on 
these data, European Health Authorities requested that all bone fractures and bone associated

events (e.g., osteoporosis) occurring during study and in the follow-up period should be 
documented regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment. In addition, the FDA requested a radiological review of all fracture imaging scans. The central radiological review of all fracture scans will evaluate the correlation between bone metastasis and fractures, and support the root cause analysis of the observe d increased incidence of fractures in the 
experimental treatment arm.  
Based on the available data on radium-223 dichloride, the option of starting a BHA including bisphosphonates or denosumab should be considered, taking into consideration applicable guide lines .

13.5 Amendment 7  
Amendment 7 is a global amendment dated 26 NOV 2019.  
13.5.1  Overview of changes 
Overall rationale for the amendment  
At the time of the final OS analysis, after approximately 500 death events, approximately 70 subjects are still receiving study medication (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone). 
To continue providing study medication to these subjects, the protocol remains open with all 
safety -related endpoints, including long term follow-up, still being collected. However, to 
 Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

reduce the burden to study subjects, evaluation of efficacy and exploratory endpoints, except 
for SSE and OS, will be discontinued following the final OS analysis. 
The criteria for discontinuation of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone / prednisolone was 
updated to follow standa rd clinical practice. Subjects discontinuing study treatment will enter 
long- term follow -up or, once a separate extended safety follow -up protocol has been 
implemented, will be directly transitioned to this extended safety follow -up study, in order to 
comp lete 7 years of safety follow-up.

The rationale for the current protocol amendment is to accommodate the subjects  who are 
still on oral study treatment (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone / prednisolone) after the study has been completed. The original EOS definition did not foresee that after completing all planned analyses, a few subjects  would remain on backbone study treatment.

14.3 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using a modified version of the bone 
lesions identified on whole body technetium-[ADDRESS_325544] / MRI .  CT  / MRI will not be used to identify bone lesions.  
Radiological progression of bone lesions will be determined according to the radiological criteria of the PCWG2 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  CT  / MRI will be used to determine progression 
according to RECIST 1.1 (i.e., increase in tumor burden and appearance of new lesions with the exception of bone lesions).  The overall time  point response and resulting date of 
progression according to modified RECIST 1.1, will take into account disease assessed by [CONTACT_186354] / MRI .  For exploratory purposes, the date of progression by [CONTACT_267442] b e determined . 
Table 14–1:   Overall time point  response  
Response  Response characteristics  
Complete response  Disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both 
target and non-target) .  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have a reduction in short axis to < [ADDRESS_325545] a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as 
reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of existing non-
target lesions and no appearance of new lesions.  
Progressive disease  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that 
is the smallest on study) .  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions or the appearance 
of one or more new lesions will also con stitute progressive disease . 
Stable disease  Steady state of disease .  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial 
response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease; no 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions and no appearance 
of new lesions.  
Modified RECIST 1.1 
Soft tissue disease (abnormal lymph nodes) and visceral lesions will be detected and 
monitored on chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT / MRI according to modified RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_325546] / MRI and will not be evaluated by [CONTACT_393] 1.1.  The described modifications in Table 14 –2 represent an 
adaptation of the published criteria based on current radiology practices.  A rationale for the modified criteria is provided.  The modified criteria may include further definitions of rules, assumptions and/or clarifications of the original RECIST 1.1.

Table 14–2 :  Modified RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_325547] / MRI cannot be selected as target or non- target lesions (to be 
followed quantitatively and qualitatively in respective ord er).  This approach has been 
successfully used in the double -blind phase III study 
(COU -AA-302) in the same 
patient population.   
When more than one measurable 
lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of 5 
lesions total (and a maximum of 2 
lesions per organ)… should be 
identified as target lesions.   Up to 5 target lesions may be 
selected at baseline and followed quantitatively in all organs 
including lymph nodes (lymph 
node system constituting one 
organ).   This is to follow the PCWG2 
recomm endation, as lymph nodes 
are predominant site of metastasis 
except bone.

14.4 Calculation for glom erular filtration rate 
In accordance with established nephrology practice and guidelines, renal function at baseline 
and throughout the study will be assessed by [CONTACT_267443], calculated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study formula.  
This equation of 4 variables (serum creatinine level, age, sex, and ethnicity) is recommended 
by [CONTACT_246237] 18 years or older.  The formula is as follows: 
GFR (mL / min / 1.73m
2) = k x 186 x ( serum creatinine )-1.154 x (age)-0.203 x (1.210 if 
Black)  
Where k = 1 (men) or 0.742 (women), GFR indicates glomerular filtration rate, and serum creatinine is measured in mg/dL.  
Subjects with a baseline GFR < 30 m L/min calculated by [CONTACT_267444].

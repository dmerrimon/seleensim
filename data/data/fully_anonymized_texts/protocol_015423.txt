3.0 OBJECTIVES  & HYPOTHESES  
3.1 Primary Objective  & Hypothesis  
(1) Objective:   Assess  Progression Free Survival  (PFS) of combination platinum -based  therapy 
with anti -Programmed Death (PD) -1 therapy followed by [CONTACT_699126] -PD-1 therapy 
in patient with suboptimal ly/ residual disease following  cytoreduc tion of  epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253] / 
primary peritoneal/ fallo pi[INVESTIGATOR_76351], which for the purposes of the protocol will be 
referred to as epi[INVESTIGATOR_115352]  (EOC) . 
Hypothesis:   Our hypothesis is that anti -PD therapy combined with standard chemotherapy will 
improve  the PFS in this population  and have a tole rable safety profile . 
3.2 Seconda ry Objectives  & Hypotheses  
(1)  Objective:   Assess Overall Survival  (OS) of combination platinum -based  therapy with 
anti-PD-1 therapy followed by [CONTACT_699126] -PD-1 therapy in patient with suboptimally / 
residual disease following  cytoreduc tion of  EOC.  
Hypothesis:   Our hypothesis is that anti -PD therapy combined with standard chemotherapy 
will improve th e OS in this population  and have a tolerable safety profile . 
(2) Objective :  Monitor quality of life during  combination therapy and single agent 
maint enance therapy with anti-PD-1 therapy with the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy (FACT) surveys at intervals during  therapy.  
Hypothesis :  We hypothesize that combination chemotherapy and anti -PD-[ADDRESS_949153]  quality of life during combined and maintenance therapy duration.   
 
3.3 Exploratory Objective s:   
The overall objectives pertain to the development of biomarkers for prediction and monitoring of 
disease status.  
(1) Objective :  Assess the PD-1 and PD-L1 expressi on in preserved tissue obtained at the time 
of initial diagnosis for patients with suboptimally / residual disease following  cytoreduc tion 
of ovarian cancer using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlate with clinical outcomes .   
(2) Objective:  Assess serial im mune profiles from blood samples obtained post-surgery, prior 
to initiation of chemotherapy, after completion of combination therapy , during anti-PD-1 
maintenance therapy and at time of recurrence with the intention of identifying potential 
correlat ions with clinical outcomes .    
PROTOCOL 3475 -250 
15 | P a g e  
 Hypothesis :   We hypothesize that analysis of the tumor microenvironment using IHC staining 
for PD -1 and PD -L1 may correlate with response to therapy.  Furthermore, we hypothesize that 
peripheral blood monitoring of immune cell profiles may provide biomarkers that correlate with 
response to therapy.  We hypothesize that tumor immune monitoring during this study will be 
able to be utilized for improvement of the rational design of future trials with better 
understanding of timing,  dosing and scheduling of combination therapy.   
3.4   Biomarker Studies:  
(3) Objective:   Collection of serial blood samples for analysis of cell free DNA (cfDNA) in 
ovarian cancer patients  over a series of time points and explore the potential role of cfDNA 
as a tool for identifying serum biomarker s. 
4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
4.[ADDRESS_949154] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformatio n 
has been known for decades .  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor -
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in vari ous malignancies .  
In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ 
regulator y T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long -term survival in many solid 
tumors.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PD-1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion  
The PD -[ADDRESS_949155] hijacked by [CONTACT_699127] e 
control.  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions.   PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_464234] 1/ CD279 ) is an  Ig superfamily member 
related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor 
signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD-L2).  The structure of m urine PD -1 
has been resolved .  PD -1 and family members are type  I transmembrane glycoproteins containing 
an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is 
responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 
tyrosine -based signali ng motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_949156] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_178863] .  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including 
peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T reg ulatory cell s and Natural Killer cells .  Expression 
has also been shown dur ing thymic development on CD4 -CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well 
as subsets of macr ophages and dendritic cells .  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non -hematopoiet ic 
PROTOCOL 3475 -250 
16 | P a g e  
 tissues as well as in  various tumors .  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing 
both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions 
with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_949157] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only 
detectably expressed on antigen -prese nting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory 
environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas 
PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell fun ction in peripheral tissues .  Although healthy 
organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant 
levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion 
in subjects with melanoma .  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pa thway plays a critical role in 
tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pembrolizumab designed to directly block the interacti on between PD -1 and its 
ligands  PD-L1 and PD -L2.  
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype .  KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently be en approved in the [LOCATION_002]  
for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and dis ease progression 
following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_699095], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor . 
4.1.2 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
In the 1 -month and 6 - month toxicology study in Cynomolgus monkeys, pembrolizumab 
administered once a week and once every other week respectively, intravenously up to 200 mg/ kg 
resulted in no adverse treatment related effects. The clinical summary of results thus far as of 2014 
for pembrolizumab monoth erapy and combination therapy include a total of 6,294 subjects with 
both hematologic and solid tumors in a total of 18 phase I, II, III clinical trials sponsored by [CONTACT_44873].   
Specifically,  KEYNOTE -021 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is a multicohort phase I/II trial of pemb rolizumab 
(2mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg) plus platinum - doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin / paclitaxel or carboplatin/ 
pemetrexed) in advanced treatment naïve patients with non -small cell lung cancer.  A total of 65 
patient were enrolled for study.  The overall inci dence of adverse events was 95% (62 of 65 
subjects).  The most commonly reported AEs experienced in this population across all dose 
regimens were fatigue (49.2%), constipation and nausea (26.2% each), decreased appetite (23.1%), 
diarrhea (18.5%) and anemia  and alopecia (15.4% each).  The incidence of drug related AEs was 
86.2% (56 of 65 subjects).  The most commonly reported drug related AEs in this population were  
fatigue (35.4%), nausea , decreased appetite and alopecia (13.8% each), diarrhea (12.3%), and 
constipation and aspartate aminotransferase elevation (10.8% each).  Grade 3 -5 drug related AEs 
were reported 23.1% of subjects (15 of 65 subjects). The most common grade 3 -5 drug related AEs 
in this population across all groups were aspartate aminotransfe rase elevation (6.2%) and anemia 
and alanine aminotransferase elevation (4.6% each).  Adverse events resulting in discontinuation 
of study were reported in 3.1% (2 of 65 subjects).  Interstitial lung disease, dermatitis allergic and 
drug eruption were the only AEs resulting in discontinuation and were reported [ADDRESS_949158] each 
(1.5%).  A total of 8 subjects’  experienced serious drug related AEs as follows:  anemia, febrile

 neutropenia, atrial fibrillation, colitis, pyrexia, hypersensitivity, alanine aminot ransferase elevation, 
aspartate  aminotransferase elevation, drug eruption, rash and urticarial.   Preliminary efficacy results 
indicate no difference across all groups suggesting a flat dose -exposure relationship.  The overall 
response rate observed for pembro lizumab in combination with chemotherapy was promising and 
warranted further examination; continuing phase II trials are underway in non -small cell lung 
cancer.

Initial treatment for ovarian cancer is usually surgical cytoreduction followed by [CONTACT_699128]  [1-4]. At the time of diagnosis over 75% of patients present with stage III 
or IV disease meaning that disease has spread into th e peritoneal cavity or distall y[5]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_699097] a nd new chemotherapeutic regimens survival has improved only modestly over 
the last two decades. While overall 5 -year survival has improved from 30% to 50%, 5 -year survival 
remains only 25% for women with advanced stage disease.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Surgical Cytoreducti on and Adjuvant Therapy   
One of t he most important prognostic factor for advanced epi[INVESTIGATOR_699098]. Virtually all retrospective 
reports have shown an inverse correlation between the largest diameter of the residual tumor and 
survival  [6-8]. Patients who undergo optimal cytoreduction (defined as no gross residual tumor after 
surgical cytoreduction)  have been found to have the most favorable prognosis  as compared to 
patients with any gross residual disease . The reported rates of optimal cytoreduction , however, vary 
widely in the literature and have been rep orted to range from  20-80%.  A recent meta -analysis 
reported an average rate of optimal cytoreduction of only 42%  [6].  The ability to achieve an optimal 
disease status is dependent on the skill of the operating surgeon,  patient co - morbidities and 
individual tumo r biology .  Those patients who undergo aggressive cytoreductive procedures but do 
not achieve an optimal cytoreduction have demonstrated decreased overall survival placing them 
in a particularly poor prognostic group .  In one review the median overall surv ival in patients with 
optimal versus suboptimal cytoreduction was 39 versus 17 months  [8]. Defining optimal in this 
population is increasingly more difficult and most agree that any residual disease is a negative 
prognostic indicator.  
All patients with advanced EOC will receive chemotherapy as well as surgery.  Modern 
chemotherapy for EOC  has incorporated many different methods  of the administration of platinum 
based regimens.  Intraperitoneal therapy with combination platinum and taxane a gents has 
demonstrated improved progression free survival  and overall survival  but has not been widely

 accepted due to its significant toxicity.  This regimen is reserved for patient who have undergone 
optimal cytoreduction;  patients who are not optimally cytoreduced are not candidates for this 
therapy.  Conve ntional re gimens are typi[INVESTIGATOR_699099] 21 days (triweekly) .  Alternatively, carboplatin has been administered every 21 days or 
triweekly , while the paclitaxel is given weekly over the 21  day cycle  (dose dense regimen).  Th is 
dose dense regimen  has been actively studied in EOC recently due the  demonstrated benefit in 
breast cancer patients receiving weekly paclitaxel  [9].  Weekly paclitaxel in combination with 
carboplatin every  3 weeks has yielded improved PFS in phase III studies comparing this regimen 
to conventional triweekly  carboplatin and paclitaxel (median overall survival of 100 months versus 
62 months) and has had a more manageable toxicity profile making it an attracti ve option for 
primary therapy  [10].   Recent prospective data, howev er, indicates that the progression free survival 
between Q3w carboplatin and Qw  paclitaxel versus Q3w  paclitaxel is not significantly different [52].  
Specifically, recent studies utilizing carboplatin with weekly paclitaxel in subopt imally 
cytoreduced (>1 cm residual disease) compared with conventional triweekly carboplatin and 
paclitaxel patients resulted in  a favorable  median PFS of 17.6 months versus 12.1 months  [11].  Dose 
dense therapy has since been adopted as one of the standard of care options for advanced ovarian 
cancer National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN ) guidelines.   
Given these limitations for  suboptimally cytoreduced patients , it is clear that improved strategies 
for the delivery of cytotoxic  therapy , novel strategies or  novel combinations should be actively 
pursued  for this population .  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Rationale for Ovarian Cancer as a Target for Immune The rapy  
Evidence is accumulating to support the significant role the immune system plays in all types of 
malignancies.  Recent evidence has concluded  that ovarian cancer is an immunogenic tumor similar 
to melanoma  and a valid immunotherapy target  [12, 13].  Over the past decade multiple studies have 
greatly increased our understanding of the immune responses in ovarian cancer patients.  Studies 
have demonstrated that those patients with ovarian cancer whose tumors were noted to have greater 
CD3+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) experienced longer progression free and overall 
surviv al [14-16].  Several investigators have corr elated immune escape mechanisms, such as increased 
CD4+CD25+F oxP3+T regulatory cells and programmed death 1 ligand, in ovarian cancer 
populations with a poor survival  [14, 17-19].  In addition, several studies have found that higher ratios 
of CD8+ cells / CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T regulatory cells to be favorable  prognostically  [20, 21].  
Together these findings indicate that ovarian cancer is a valid target for immunotherapy.  
4.2.1. [ADDRESS_949160] 
important immunostimulatory effects.  Hato et al [22] demonstrated that platinum based therapy 
augments the capacity of dendritic cells to induce antigen -specific T cell  proliferation, induces 
down  regulation of PD L -[ADDRESS_949161].  Paclitaxel has been found to be immunostimulatory with 
upregulation of the cytotoxic T -cell functio n [23] and decrease of T regulatory cell populations  [24].  
Specifically, dose dense chemotherapy’s clinical advantage may i n fact be linked to its potential 
PROTOCOL 3475 -250 
19 | P a g e  
 immune advantages over conventional therapy.  In a study by [CONTACT_280172]  [25] dose dense 
combination therapy with weekly platinum and paclitaxel was utilized in an ovarian tumor model 
and was found to be less toxic to the immune system, reduced immunosuppression by [CONTACT_699129] -specific CD8+ T cell  
responses to tumors.  These results were then validated in 14 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.   
As a result of these findings, combin ing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, once thought to be 
incompatible, is now thought to be  a rational therapeutic option.  
The ideal window (dose and scheduling) for combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy is 
currently under investigation, however, preclinical studies by [CONTACT_129741]  [24] have found that the 
combination of vaccine therapy when combined c oncomitantly with cytotoxic doses of carboplatin 
and paclitaxel in mice produced an enhanced anti -tumor effect compared with therapy with the 
vaccine alone.  This lends support to the concept that the concomitant combination of 
immunomodulation with standa rd chemotherapy has potential to be an effective strategy.   In 
addition, in a phase 2 study by [CONTACT_699130]  [26] evaluating the immune adjuvant properties of front -
line carboplatin -paclitaxel with alternative schedules of intraven ous oregovomab chemo -
immunotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer, found that treatment emergent CA125 -specific cellular 
immunity was measured more commonly with simultaneous (cycle day 1) administration of 
oregovomab therapy with chemotherapy versus one week delayed infusion of oregovomab after 
chemotherapy (p=0.04) and that additional clinical parameters favored this schedule.  Timing of 
immunotherapy with chemotherapy is an active area of research.    
Combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy strategies are emerging,  and safety data is 
becoming available.  The [COMPANY_006] -sponsored protocol  P011 is a combination therapy trial in which 
pembrolizumab monotherapy was compared with pembrolizumab in combination with 
cisplatin/pemetrexed and carboplatin/paclitaxel.   Adverse events were generally manageable and 
infrequently required discontinuation of pembrolizumab treatment.    Thus,  the feasibility of the 
combined strategy as well as the safety of the combination has been demonstrated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Maint enance Therapy in Ovarian Cancer  
The mechanism  by [CONTACT_699131].   The 
concept of ‘ovarian cancer repopulation ’ as reviewed by [CONTACT_699132] [27] elaborates on the 
phenomenon that a population of cancer cells may have an intrinsic ability to escape cytotoxic 
therapy and have the ability to repopulate into solid tumors.  He emphasizes that t he period of time 
in remission is an ideal opportunity to introduce consolidative maintenance therapy as a means of 
blocking tumor repopulation.  Several clinical studies have looked closely at the addition of 
maintenance therapy for prolongation of tumor remission in ovarian cancer patients.  The strongest 
studies to date have incorporated maintenance therapy with additional cycles of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (paclitaxel) or antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab).  Both have demonstrated an 
effect on progressio n free survival but  have yet to demonstrate an impact on overall survival.  They 
are hampered as well by [CONTACT_699133], respectively  [3, 28].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], 
the concept of  maintenance therapy remains a rational strategy that requires furthe r evaluation in 
ovarian cancer.  
Our study therefore proposes a strategy to integrate immune therapy with the current standard 
chemotherapy for ovarian cancer via a phase II open label nonrandomized single arm study of 
PROTOCOL 3475 -250

 intravenous (IV) combination carboplatin /paclitaxel chemotherapy in s uboptimally cytoreduced 
patients with stage III/IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_699100] -PD-
1 antibody Pembrolizumab (200 mg IV) day 1 of each 3 week cycle concomitantly with carboplatin 
every 21 days and paclitaxel administe red weekly every 21 days followed by 12 cycles of IV 
Pembrolizumab maintenance monotherapy therapy (200 mg IV q 3 weeks).  Our primary objective s 
will be to determine  if this subset of ovarian cancer patients observes an improved progression free  
survival .  In addition , we will assess the safety and overall survival from this regimen  compared to 
historical controls.  Our secondary objectives will include documentation of patient quality of life 
(QOL) at i ntervals throughout the study and  evaluation of poten tial biomarkers with assess ment of  
the tumor microenvir onment at the time of diagnosis.  We will also  accumulate data on the immune 
cell subsets during the study  to inform future designs of clinical trials employing immune therapy 
in combination with chemo therapy and/or maintenance therapy.  
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
An open -label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical 
activity of single agent pembrolizumab .  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three 
dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered e very 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with 
advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated,  and no dose -limiting toxicities 
were observed.  This first in human study of pembrolizumab  showed evidence of target 
engagement and objective evidence of  tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg 
and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No maximum tolerated dose has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, 
the highest dose tested in [COMPANY_006] protocol PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in 
Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other 
clinical studies within the pembrolizumab  program has shown that a lower dose of 
pembrolizumab  and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engageme nt and cli nical 
activity.  
 
PK data analysis of pembrolizumab  administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic 
data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target enga gement is durable (>21 days).  This 
early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W 
dosing schedule.   
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data 
from [ADDRESS_949162] a wide therapeutic range based on the 
melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 
mg/kg Q3W body weight -based  regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established 
exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for pembrolizumab  in the melanoma indication. The exposure 
margi ns are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. 
the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5 -fold higher dose and exposure). The 
population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor b urden on 
PROTOCOL 3475 -250 
21 | P a g e  
 exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. 
Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  
 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable  doses of pembrolizumab in solid 
tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg 
or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response relationships of 
pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safet y in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 
3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as 
assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab 
target enga gement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed 
dose of 200 mg eve ry 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those 
obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the 
exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy resp onse and 3) will 
maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well 
tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to 
reduce potential for d osing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the 
logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.

Progression of disease or recurr ence is defined as increasing clinical, radiological or histological

histological basis must also have a CT scan performed for further confirmation.  CT s can will be 
scheduled at specific intervals (Trial Flow Chart 6.0) but may also be performed at discretion of 
investigator if recurrent or progression of disease or symptoms warrant evaluation.   
Progression free survival (PFS) will be defined as date of c ompletion of primary therapy to the date 
of first clinical, biochemical, or radiological evidence of progression or death due to any cause.  
PFS will be censored at the last assessment of disease progression for living patients.

patients with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -refractory melanoma.  PD -L1 expression is a possible biomarker to 
identify patients for PD -1 directed therapy  [33-36]. Several PD -L1 expression assays have been 
described  [37-39]; studies addressing assa y comparison, standardization, or validation are not yet 
published.   PD-L1 expression is also unlikely to be the only candidate biomarker for predicting 
response to PD -[ADDRESS_949167] been identified.  The PD -L1 
monoclonal antibodies utilized in this study will be SP142, E1L3N .  Several other validated PD -L1 
monoclonal antibodies, e.g., E1J2J, 5H1 and 28.8  are not commercially available; if these clones 
become available then they will be used as well. The commercially available, IHC - validated PD -1 
clone NAT  will be used for analysis of PD -1 expression.    
 
IHC will be optimized by [CONTACT_699136][INVESTIGATOR_699101] (ie, low pH and high 
pH), PD -L1 and PD -1 titers, and the inclusion or exclusion of a signal -boosting linker.  Specificity

that reflects an immunogenic response to pembrolizumab immunotherapy and correlates with an 
increase in survival.  
Immune Cell Subsets  
As a measure of systemic immunity, the rel ative percentage of circulating immune cells will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_64392]. Multiparametric flow cytometry will allow for 
identification of immune cell subsets by [CONTACT_699138]. Flow cytometry will be performed on a LSR II cytometer (BD 
Biosciences) located in the Clinical Immunology Research Laboratory, a CLIA certified lab that 
performs clinical flow cytometry at the Medical College of Wisconsin. We will use flow cytomet ry 
of antibody stained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to evaluate the relative percentage 
of cell types including T, B, NK and myeloid cells. As an indirect indicator of T cell function, the 
expression of T cell inhibitory receptors, activation  markers, as well as the presence of regulatory 
T cells will be determined. Correlating changes in immune cell subsets with pembrolizumab 
treatment and survival will facilitate the identification of a peripheral immune signature [CONTACT_699171] -tumor immunity. The antibody panels designed to identify the 
percentage of immune cell subsets present in PBMCs are shown in Table 4.[ADDRESS_949170] been reported in cancer patients. However, currently,

 there are no defined cytokine signatures that are cancer specific  or predictive of disease outcome. 
For this study, serum cytokines will be analyzed longitudinally before and after pembrolizumab 
therapy. Serum cytokines will be quantified using the human cytokine/chemokine 65 -plex array 
(Eve Technologies). This array pe rforms analysis of the following cyto/chemokines: CXCL1,

as a potential serum biomarker.  
 
Ovarian cancer is typi[INVESTIGATOR_699103] k of effective screening 
and limited ability to diagnose the disease in its early stages.  Genomic  variations are frequently 
found in tumor tissue but determination via tissue is a very costly measure and does not allow 
for the potential benefits of early diagnosis in the setting of ovarian cancer.  It is well known 
that tumor -released DNAs are detectable as cell free DNAs (cfDNAs) in bodily fluids  [40-42]. 
Whole genome sequencing has revealed significant DNA copy number variations in tumor 
tissues as well as in cell free DNA plasma of cancer patients.  The collection and analysis of 
cfDNA from circulating blood in patients with canc er diagnoses may provide a means of 
determining the genomic variations present in a patient without direct tumor biopsy.  As a result, 
there has been a growing interest in trying to use tumor -derived cfDNA as a non -invasive 
biomarker to detect the presence  of malignancy, follow treatment response, gauge prognosis, or 
monitor for recurrence  [43, 44]. The genetic analysis of cfDNA in circulating bodily fluids is often 
referred to as “liquid biopsy”  [45-47]. Unlike tissue biopsy, the liquid biopsy is able to capture 
whole landscap e of genomic abnormalities derived from both primary and metastatic tumors, 
therefore effectively eliminates heterogeneity issue facing traditional biopsy. In the planned 
future study, we will take advantage of collected plasma from these patients in the t rials. [CONTACT_699176], Professor of Pathology, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at Medical College 
of Wisconsin will analyze the cfDNAs collected from patient plasma samples for copy number 
variations and gene mutations using next generation sequencing technology on plasma samples 
at serial time points during the study. We will correlate the genomic and genetic variations 
discovered in cfDNA with patients’ response to the treatment and clinical outcomes for 
advanced stage ovarian cancer. This study will facilitate the new biomarker discovery for 
monitoring treatment effect and disease progression.

 Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE  Version 5.0 for toxicity and adverse event reporting .  A copy 
of the CTCAE Version 5.0 can be downloade d from the CTEP  homepage ( http://ctep.info.nih.gov ). 
All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by [CONTACT_56313], 
must be recorded, with details about the duration and inten sity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken 
with respect to the test drug, and the patient’s outcome. The investigator must evaluate each adverse 
experience for its relationship to the test drug and for its seriousness.  
Any patient whose treatment is delayed mu st be evaluated on a weekly basis until adequate 
hematologic and non -hematologic parameters have been met. Treatment delays are to be kept to a 
minimum and every effort should be made to maintain the intended schedule. No treatment delays 
are permitted for  other than documented toxicity. If delays of greater than three weeks occur, 
patients must be taken off study.  
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not 
related to study therapy (e.g., elective s urgery, unrelated medical events , and/or holidays). Subjects 
should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless 
otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be documented in the 
patient's  study record.

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Dose Modification Guidelines for C arboplatin , Paclitaxel  and Docetaxel . 
Hematologic Toxicity :  
• Initial treatment modification will consist of cycle delay and/or up to 1 dose level reduction 
of either carboplatin or paclitaxel or both  per anticipated tolerance as determined by [CONTACT_699140] . 
• Erythropoietin use is permitted based on st andard clinical guidelines  
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandP
roviders/ucm126481.htm ). Erythropoietin should not be used in patients with underlying 
venous thromboembolic disease.  
• Patients will not receive pr ophylactic growth factors (filgrastim, pegfilgrastim) unless they 
experience recurrent neutropenic complications after specified treatment modifications  per 
treating physician discretion . 
• Patients may NOT receive amifostine or other protective reagents.  
• Treatment decisions will be based on the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) rather than total 
white cell count ( WBC ). 
• Subsequent cycles of therapy will not begin until the ANC is > 1500 cells/mm3 and the 
platelet count is > 100,000 cells/mm3  for patients on the Q3W therapy. For patients on 
dose-dense (weekly) paclitaxel , subsequent cycles of therapy  will not begin until ANC is 
>1000 cells/mm3 and the platelet count is >75,000 cells/mm3 . Therapy will be delayed for 
a maximum of 3 weeks until t hese values are achieved. Patients who fail to recover 
adequate counts within a 4-week delay may be removed from study  per discussion with 
the study sponsor . 
PROTOCOL 3475 -250 
32 | P a g e  
 • The day [ADDRESS_949197] 500 
cells/mcl and the platelet count is at least 50,000/ mcl.  If not given those doses are 
omitted and not made up.  If after omission of a dose the subsequent labs  again do not 
meet criteria and a second dose requires omission,  then chemotherapy  should be reduced 
by [CONTACT_30560].  
• For first occurrence of febrile neutropenia, and/or documented grade 4 neutropenia (ANC 
< 500) persisting > 7 days, reduce chemothe rapy b y one dose level (Table 5.4 ) on 
subsequent cycles.  
• For subsequent occurrences of febrile neutropenia, and/or grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 
500) persisting > 7 days, chemotherapy may be reduced by [CONTACT_699141]/ or 
growth factors may be initiated at th e discretion of the treating provider.    
• Patients with grade 3 thrombocytopenia (< 50,000 cells/mm3) at any time will have a one 
dose level reduction of carboplatin.  
• If dose modified patients experience recurrent delays of > 2 weeks or develop febrile 
neutropenia during subsequent cycles, then G -CSF (Neupogen or Neulasta) should be 
added if the patient is not already receiving G -CSF.  
• If patients on the Q3w pembrolizumab, carboplatin and Qw taxol regimen experience 
continued treatment delays due to treatment  related toxicity then consideration to changing 
regimen to Q3w  carboplatin/ paclitaxel (or docetaxel ) with pembrolizumab should be 
discussed with the sponsor.  Dosing of Q3w  carboplatin/docetaxel with pembrolizumab 
will be per institutional standard.  
Neuro pathy :  
Paclitaxel weekly  (Qw)  regimen.  
Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy requires reduction of one dose level of paclitaxel and 
delay in therapy for a maximum of 2 weeks until recovered to grade 1.  If > grade 2 neuropathy 
does not resolve to < grade 1  within 2 weeks, discontinue weekly paclitaxel and initiate paclitaxel 
135 mg/m2 q 3 week ly with carboplatin and pembrolizumab according to their next planned 
administration .  Sponsor should be notified if patients require change of regimen.  If > grade [ADDRESS_949198] on the q 3 week

Hepatic Toxicity : Grade 3 (or greater) elevations in AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin 
require reduction of one dose level for paclitaxel and delay in subsequent therapy for a maximum 
of 3 weeks until recovered to grade 1.   
Renal toxicity:   
Grade > [ADDRESS_949201] be notified and patient will be removed from study.  Serum creatinine sho uld be drawn 
with each cycle per flow chart table 6.0 for calculation of creatinine clearance.  
Alopecia : No dose modification will be made for alopecia.  
Fatigue : No dose modification will be made for fatigue  grade < 2. 
Gastrointestinal  Toxicity : Bowel obstruction : Patients may continue with stu dy treatment for grade 
1 partial obstructions that do NOT require medical intervention.   
> grade 2 GI toxicity requires dose reduction of one dose level of docetaxel.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions:  Hypersensitivity reactions should be managed per institutional 
standards. In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel, docetaxel should b e substituted 
for paclitaxel according to institutional guidelines (See table 5.4).  
Management Guidelines for unrelated adverse events:  
For unrelated adverse events, you can hold treatment week by [CONTACT_699142] [ADDRESS_949202] the study sponsor for either

 5.3.2 Timing of Dose Administration  
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments 
have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  Trial treatment may be 
administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative 
reasons.  
Patients may be treated up  to 8 weeks from cytoreductive surgery but no soone r than 3 weeks from 
surgery.  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pembrolizumab  
Administration  
Pembrolizumab  200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion Day 1 every 3 weeks.  Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 
minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).  
Supplier  
Pembroli zumab will be supplied by [CONTACT_44873].  
Formulation  
Two Drug Product (DP) dosage forms are available for pembrolizumab : a white to off -white 
lyophilized powder, 50 mg/vial, and a liquid, DP 100 mg/vial, both in Type I glass vials intended 
for single use only.  
 
Pembrolizumab  Powder for Solution for Infusion, 50 mg/vial, is reconstituted with sterile water for 
injection prior to use.  Pembrolizumab  is formulated with L -histidine as a buffering agent, 
polysorbate 80 as surfactant, sucrose as a stabilizer/tonicity mod ifier, and hydrocholoric acid (HCl)  
and /or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for pH adjustment if necessary.  
 
Pembrolizumab  Solution for Infusion 100mg/vial is a liquid DP, and  has the identical formulation 
as that of the reconstituted lyophilized vial.  
 
Preparation  
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab 
infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution.  
 
Storage  
Both dru g product dosage forms are stored under refrigerated conditions (2°C - 8°C).  
The product after reconstitution with sterile water for injection and the liquid drug  product are a 
clear to opalescent solution which may contain proteinaceous and  extraneous par ticulates. The 
reconstituted lyophilized product and the liquid product are  intended for IV administration. The 
PROTOCOL 3475 -250 
35 | P a g e  
 reconstituted DP solution or the liquid DP can be  further diluted with normal saline in IV 
containers made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or  non-PVC material. Reconstituted vials should be 
immediately used to prepare the  infusion solution in the IV bag and the infusion solution should 
be immediately  administered. If not used immediately, vials and/or IV bags may be stored at 2 -8 
°C for  up to a cumulative time of 20 hours. If refrigerated, the vials and/or IV bags should be  
allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to subsequent use. Pembrolizumab  solutions  may 
be stored at room temperature for a cumulative time of up to 4 hours. This incl udes room 
temperature storage of reconstituted or liquid DP solution in vials, room  temperature storage of 
infusion solution in the IV bag and the duration of infusion.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Carboplatin   
Administration  
Carboplatin will  be administered at an AUC of [ADDRESS_949203] be reconstituted  with either  sterile water  
for injection,  USP, 5%  dextrose  in water,  or 0.9%  sodium chloride  injection,  USP, according  to

Vial strength  Diluent volume  
50 mg  5 ml 
150 mg  15 ml  
450 mg  45 ml  
 
These dilutions all produce a carboplatin  concentration  of 10 mg/ml.  When prepared  as directed, 
carboplatin  solutions are stable for eight  hours  at room temperature,  since  no antibacterial  
preservative is contained  in the  formulation  it is recommended  that carboplatin  solutions be  
discarded  eight  hours  after dilution.  
 
NOTE:  aluminum reacts  with carboplatin  causing  precipi[INVESTIGATOR_699109] ,

[IP_ADDRESS]  Paclitaxel  
Paclitaxel is a poorly soluble plant product from the western yew, Taxus brevifolia . 
Administration  
Paclitaxel at a dose of 80 mg/ m2 will be administered Day 1, Day  8, and Day 15.  Paclitaxel,  at 
the appropriate dose and dilution, will be  given  as a 1-hour continuous  IV infusion. Paclitaxel  
will be administered  via an infusion  control  device  (pump)  using  non-PVC tubing and 
connectors,  such as the IV administration  sets (polyethylene or polyolefin)  which  are used to 
infuse  parenteral  Nitroglycerin.  Nothing  else other than 0.9%  sodium  chloride is to be  infused  
through  the line where paclitaxel is being  administered.  
*If the provider’s ch oice is paclitaxel q 3 weekly, paclitaxel will be administered IV over 3 hours 
on day 1 of every 21 day cycle.  
 
Supplier  
Paclitaxel is commercially available.  
Formulation  
Paclitaxel  is supplied as a  sterile solution concentrate, 6 mg/ml, in 5 ml vials  (30 mg/vial) or 17 ml 
vials (100 mg/vial) in polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) 50% in dehydrated alcohol, 
USP, 50%.  Improved solubility requires a mixed solvent system with further dilutions of  either 
0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water.  The contents of the vial must be diluted just prior 
to clinical use.  
Preparation  
Paclitaxel, at the appropriate dose, will be diluted in 500 -1000 cc of 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 
USP or 5% dextrose  injection, USP (D5W) (500 cc’s is adequate if paclitaxel is a single agent). 
Paclitaxel must be prepared in glass or polyolefin containers due to leaching of 
diethylhex ylphthalate (DHEP) plasticizer from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags and intravenous 
tubin g by [CONTACT_8244].  
NOTE: Formation of a small number of fibers in solution (within acceptable limits established by 
[CONTACT_69148]) have been observed after preparation of paclitaxel. 
Therefore, in -line filtration is necessary for administration of paclitaxel solutions. In-line filtration  
should be  accomplished  by [CONTACT_8246]  a hydrophilic,  microporous  filter  of pore size not greater  
than 0.22 microns  (e.g.: IVEX -II, IVEX -HP or equivalent)  into the  IV fluid pathway  distal  to the 
infusion  pump. Although  particulate  formation  does not indicate loss of drug  potency,  solutions 
exhibiting  excessive particulate  matter  formation  should not be used.  
Storage  
The intact  vials should be stored  between  2-25ºC  (36-77ºF).  
 
 
PROTOCOL 3475 -250 
37 | P a g e  
 Stability  
Commercially  available  paclitaxel  will be labeled  with an expi[INVESTIGATOR_78288].  All solutions of 
paclitaxel  exhibit a slight  haziness directly  proportional  to the concentration  of drug and the time  
elapsed  after preparation,  although  when  prepared  as described above,  solutions of paclitaxel  
(0.3-1.2 mg/ml)  are physically  and chemically  stable  for 27 hours.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Docetaxel  
Docetaxel is a microtubule inhibitor.  
  
Administration  
The final docetaxel dilution for infusion should be administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion.   
 
All patients should be pre -medicated with oral corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone 8 mg BID) 
for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel administratio n in order to reduce the incidence and 
severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions  
 
Supplier  
Docetaxel is commercially available.  
 
Formulation  
Docetaxel is supplied in a single dose vial as a sterile, non -pyrogenic, no n-aqueous viscous 
solution with an accompanying sterile, non -pyrogenic, diluent (13% ethanol in water) vial.  It is 
supplied in two vial formulations; 20mg/0.5ml or 80mg/2ml of docetaxel.  Docetaxel is also 
supplied as a pre -diluted 10mg/ml concentration i n 80mg and 20mg vials.  
 
Preparation  
Using the pre -diluted 10mg/ml formulation:  Aseptically withdraw the required amount of 
docetaxel (10mg/ml) with a calibrated syringe and inject into a 250ml infusion bag of 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose s olution to produce a final concentration of 0.3 to 0.74 
mg/mL.  Thoroughly mix the infusion by [CONTACT_30545].  Inspect the final product for 
particulate matter or discoloration prior to administration, if it is not clear or appears to have 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332],  the product should be discarded.  
 
NOTE: Contact [CONTACT_699144]. In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP, 
which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, the final docetaxel dilution for infusion 
should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic (polypropylene, polyolefin) bags and 
administered through polyethylene -lined administration sets.  
 
Storage  
Store between 2°C and  25°C (36°F and 77°F).  Retain in the original package to protect from 
bright light.  Freezing does not adversely affect the product.   
 
Stability  
Docetaxel final dilution for infusion is stable for 4 hours (including the 1hour intravenous 
administration time) if stored at room temperature, between 2°C and 25°C (36°F and 77°F).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Biometric Considerations  
Actual body weight will be used for paclitaxel /docetaxel  dose calculations  and adjusted body 
weight will be used for carboplatin dose calculations . However , if the Actual Body weight is < Ideal 
Body weight, then use Actual Body weight to calculate the creatinine clearance.  
• The patient’s initial weight will be used to determine the dosing of all agents for the duration 
of the study. If a patient’s weight chan ges by > 10% during the course of the study, the dose 
for all agents will be recalculated with the new weight  per institutional standard . 
 
Dose Calculation  
The patient’s height and weight will be determined at the screening visit. Weight should be obtained  
prior to  treatment on day 1 of every treatment cycle . If the patient’s weight changes by [CONTACT_7809] 
10% prior to the start of the cycle,  then the drug doses will be recalculated.  
• The dose of carboplatin will be calculated using the Calvert Formula using  a glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) from the modified Cockcroft -Gault formula.  
Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC x (GFR + 25)  
• For the purposes of this protocol, the GFR is considered to be equivalent to the creatinine 
clearance. The creatinine clearance i s calculated by [CONTACT_3433] e modified Cockcroft -Gault formula.    
CrCl = [ ((140 - age in years)) x ( adjusted body  weight in kg)) / (7 2 x serum creatinine in 
mg/dl)) ] x 0.85  
• In patients with an abnormally low serum creatinine (less than or equal to  0.6 mg/dl), due to 
reduced protein intake and/or low muscle mass, the creatinine clearance should be estimated 
using a minimum value of 0.6 mg/dl.  
• The maximum absolute dose of carboplatin (AUC 6) given to each patient will be limited to 
900mg.    
 
5.3.3 Sequence  
• On cycle day 1, pembrolizumab should be administered first  over [ADDRESS_949204] . The regimen can be administered in an outpatient set ting.  
• On cycle Day 8 and 15 paclitaxel will be administered over 1 hour  in an outpatient setting .   
• During maintenance therapy cycles, single agent pembrolizumab will be administered 
over 30 minutes.  
 
*Patients who experience a hypersensitivity reaction t o paclitaxel or toxicity (see section [IP_ADDRESS].1) 
may be switched to docetaxel per investigator’s discretion.  
*Paclitaxel and Carboplatin reactions will be managed according to each individual institution ’s

5.3.9 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events and Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_124133].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below and in greater detai l in the ECI guidance 
document. Where appropriate, t hese guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with 
administration of corticosteroids.   No te that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary 
as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should 
be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease  or bacterial or viral infection, which 
PROTOCOL 3475 -250 
41 | P a g e  
 might require additional supportive care. The  treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when 
the investigator  determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigat or is instructed 
to follow the ECI reporting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined 
in the ECI guidance document). Refer to Section 5.3  for dose modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event. Suggested conditional procedures, as appropriate, 
can be found in the ECI guidance document  in section [IP_ADDRESS].2 .

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_949209] (ECI) Reporting and ECI Treatment Guidelines  
 
Pembrolizumab  is generall y well tolerated  and demonstrates  a favorable  safety profile  in 
comparison  to chemotherap y. Pembrolizumab  is an immunomodulatory  agent, and based  on this 
mechanism  of action,  immune  mediated  advers e events  are of primary  concern.  Important  
identified  risks  for pembrolizumab  are of an immune  mediate  nature , including:  pneumonitis,  
colitis,  thyroid disorders  (hypothyroidism /hyperth yroidism),  hepatitis,  hypoph ysitis, Type I 
diabetes  mellitus , uveitis,  and nephritis.  After a recent  revie w of data,  events  newl y characterized  
as identified  risks  also include  pancreatitis,  myositis,  and severe  skin reaction;  these  are included  
in the reference  safety information  below.  The majority  of immune -mediated  adverse  events  
were  mild to moderat e in severi ty, were manageable  with appropriat e care, and rarely require d 
discontinuation  of therap y.  Further  details  around  frequenc y, reporting,  and management  of 
immun e-related  adverse  events  (irAE s) are specifically describe d below.  In addition  to the 
previousl y noted  identified  risks,  infusio n-related  reaction s are a risk but are not considered  
immune  mediated ; these  are furthe r described  below.  
 
Immune -related adverse reactions.  
  An irAE is defined as a clinically significant AE of any organ that is associated with study  drug 
exposure, is of unknown etiology, and is consistent with an immune -related mechanism.  The most 
commonly reported immune -related adverse events across the dose schedules are  hypothyroidism 
(7.2%), pneumonitis (2.9%), hyperthyroidi sm (2.2%), colitis (1.3%) and skin  
AEOSI (1.3% including all terms).

 5.3.10  Diet/Activity/Other Considerations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diet 
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE such as 
diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Contraception  
Pembro lizumab  may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known if 
pembrolizumab  has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.  Non-pregnant, non -
breast -feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are 
considered highly unlikely to conceive.  Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically 
sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for 
greater than 1 year will be considered postme nopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the 
duration of the study.  The two birth control methods can be either two barrier methods or a barrier 
method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should start using birth control 
from study  Visit [ADDRESS_949214] dose of study therapy.  
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by 
[CONTACT_3969]), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide.  Appropriate hormonal 
contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an 
estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular 
agents).  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study 
they must adhere  to the contraception requirement (described above) for the du ration of  the study 
and during the  follow -up period defined in section  
Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor  and to [COMPANY_006] .  If there is any question that a 
subject will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subjec t should not be 
entered into the study.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_949215]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome 
of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours  
to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006]  if the outcome is  a serious adverse experience 
(e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the 
mother or newborn).   
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregn ancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male subject 
impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and 
the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] and followed as des cribed above and in Section 
7.2.2.  
PROTOCOL 3475 -250 
48 | P a g e  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Use in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab  is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are excreted 
in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, 
subjects who are breast -feeding are not eligible for enrollment.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_949216] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_699147], the trial 
plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.  Specific details regarding 
discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 7.1.4 – Other Procedures.  
A subject must be discontinued from the tria l for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws consent.  
• Confirmed radiographic disease progression  
Note : For unconfirmed radiographic disease progr ession, please see Section 7.1.2. 7. 
Note : A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment with confirmed 
radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved, please see Section 
7.1.2.  
• Unacceptable adverse experiences  as described in Section 5.3  
• Interc urrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject  
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test  
• Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
• The subject is lost to f ollow -up 
• Completed  planned study protocol . 
• Administrative reasons . 
 
The End of Treatment and Follow -up visit procedures are listed in Section 6 (Protocol Flow Chart) 
and Section 7.1.5 (Visit Requirements).  After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed 
for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for 90 days after 
the end of treatment as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Subjects who discontinue for reasons other 
than progressive disease will have post -treatme nt follow -up for disease status until disease

 7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
7.1 Trial Procedures  
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform 
these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_112102]/or 
[COMPANY_006] for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may 
require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
7.1.1 Administrative Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Informed Consent  
The Investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial . 
7.1.[ADDRESS_949222]’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s legally 
acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated signature 
[CONTACT_699173].  
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participation 
in the trial.  
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and 
any written information provided to the subject m ust receive the IRB approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  The subject or his/her legally acceptable representative should be 
informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the 
subject’s willingness to cont inue participation in the trial.  The communication of this 
information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the 
original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s legally 
acceptable r epresentative’s dated signature.  
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at 
the protocol level.   
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations 
and Sponsor requ irements.  
 
PROTOCOL3475 -250  
  
 
55 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Site Activation and Subject Enrollment  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Once the IRB approval is received at the coordinating site (MCW), Sponsor 
Investigator will inform [COMPANY_006] and the participating site. Participating site must 
submit the most current protocol, informed consent forms and other documents as 
prepared and submitted by [CONTACT_699148]. Informed 
consent language may vary based on the requirements of the local IRB of each 
site. A site initiation visit (SIV) will be conducted via te leconference to train the 
study staff at both sites and to discuss important milestones.  An initial in person 
visit may also be necessary for initial training.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_949223] consented 
to trial par ticipation. If a patient is screened - regardless of whether or not they are 
registered to the study – their details should be entered into the MCW Oncore 
CTMS.  The Participating Institution will receive Oncore CTMS training from the 
MCW Oncore CTMS Admin istrator. The Coordinating Site will conduct monthly 
conference calls to discuss any ongoing questions or concerns regarding the 
conduct of the study. Patients will receive a screening ID that will be used to 
identify the patient throughout the study. At t his time patients will be considered 
registered on the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_949224]’s entry into this study is recorded in the subject’s source 
documents. The original consent form, signed and dated by [CONTACT_699149]’s entry into the study, must be 
maintained i n the investigator’s study files at each participating institution.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Participating Sites will upload all de -identified source documents with patient 
study IDs confirming patient eligibility into Oncore CTMS. The coordinating 
center will review all document s and confirm eligibility.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Assignment of Screening Number    
Unique number will be generated at each site corresponding to site designation assignment 
and then numerically according to the order in which  patient was screened.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assignment of Randomization Number :  None. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Trial Compliance (Medicati on/Diet/Activity/Other)    
Assessment will be made prior to each cycle  as noted in Trial Flow Chart Section 6.0.   
7.1.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
Each participating site will be responsible for adverse event assessing and reporting to the 
respective site IRBs. Each serious unexpected event must be reported to the Sponsor -
Investigator within [ADDRESS_949230] to evaluate for potential new or 
worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated.  
Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the stu dy and during the follow -
up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 (see Section 1 1.2).  Toxicities will be 
characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with 
regard to trial treatment.  
For subjects receivin g treatment with pembrolizumab all AEs of unknown etiology associated 
with pembrolizumab exposure should be evaluated to determine if it is possibly an event of 
clinical interest (ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed immune -related adverse 
events, or irAEs).  The principle investigator may report any event considered as potentially 
immune related as an event of clinical interest regardless of the listed events of clinical interest 
listed in the ECI guidelines.  
A member of the study staff from each site should complete the SAE eCRF within 24 hours 
of learning of the event and email (uyarIIT[COMPANY_006]3475 -[EMAIL_13368]) or fax (414 -805-
6622 ) the completed form signed by [CONTACT_699150].  
 
The initial SAE should be followed until resolution and updated in the SAE eCRF. Follow -
up SAE information is sent to the same contacts listed above. Each site is responsible for 
reporting SAEs to their local Institutional Review Board per institutional guidelines.  
 
Please refer  to section 7.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of 
AEs.  Please refer to section [IP_ADDRESS] for information regarding identification and management 
of irAEs and ECIs.  
PROTOCOL3475 -250  
  
 
58 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Full Physical Exam  
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the 
screening period.  Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history.  A full physical exam should be performed during screening,  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Directed  Physical Exam  
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart  (Secti on 6.0) , the 
investigator or qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated 
prior to trial treatment administration.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital  Signs  
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in 
the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  Vital signs should include t empera ture, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and blood pressure.  Weight will be collected on Day 1 of each Treatment Cycle. Height 
will be measured at screening only.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale  
The investigator or qualified design ee will assess ECOG status at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and discontinuation of trial treatment as specified 
in the Trial Flow Chart  (Secti on 6.0) .

response and have no evidence of disease progression on the post -treatment scan or a rising 
CA [ADDRESS_949232]  1.1 Criteria  [29] 
Measurable  disease is defined  as at least one lesion that can be accurately  measured  in at 
least one dimension  (longest  dimension to be recorded) . Each  lesion must be [ADDRESS_949233]. 
 
PROTOCOL3475 -250  
  
 
59 
 Baseline assessment  
Baseline documentation  of ‘Target’ and ‘Non-Target ’ lesions.  All measurable  lesions up to 
a maximum of 5 lesions  per organ  and 10 lesions  in total representative  of all involved organs  
should be  identified  as target  lesions and will be recorded  and measured  at baseline.  Target  
lesions  should be  selected  on the  basis  of their size (lesions  with the longest  dimension)  and 
their suitability  for accurate  repetitive  measurements by [CONTACT_699151]  
(either  by [CONTACT_699152]).   A sum of the  longest  dimension (LD)  for all 
target  lesions  will be calculated  and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD 
will be  used as reference  to further  characterize the objective tumor  response  of the 
measurable dimension of the  disease.  
 
All other  lesions  (or sites  of disease)  should be identified  as Non-Target  lesions and should 
also be recorded  at baseline.   Measurements  are not required,  and these lesions should be  
followed  as “present”  or “absent”.  All baseline evaluations  of disease status should be 
performed  as close  as possible to the start  of treatment  and never  more than [ADDRESS_949234] response  
achieved by [CONTACT_699153].  
 
Complete  Response  (CR) is disappearance of all target and non-target  lesions and no 
evidence  of new lesions  documented  by [CONTACT_699154] 4 weeks apart.   
Normalization  of CA125, if  elevated  at baseline,  is required  for ovarian  carcinoma studies.  
 
Partial  Response  (PR)  is at least a 30%  decrease in the sum of longest  dimensions  (LD)  of 
all target measurable lesions taking  as reference the baseline sum of  LD.  There  can be no 
unequivocal  progression  of non- target lesions and no new lesions.   Documentation  by [CONTACT_699155] 4 weeks apart  is required.   In the case where the ONLY  target  
lesion  is a solitary  pelvic mass measured  by [CONTACT_3971],  which  is not radiographically  
measurable,  a 50% decrease in the  LD is required.  
 
Increasing  disease  is at least a 20%  increase in the  sum of  LD of target  lesions taking  as 
references the smallest sum  LD or the appearance of new  lesions  within 8 weeks  of study  
entry.   Unequivocal progression  of existing  non-target  lesions, other  than pleural  effusions  
without  cytological  proof  of neoplastic origin,  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_699111] 
8 weeks  of study  entry  is also considered  increasing  disease (in  this circumstance an  
explanation  must  be provided).   In the case where  the ONLY  target  lesion  is a solitary  pelvic  
mass measured  by [CONTACT_3971], which is not radiographically  measurable, a  50% increase  
in the  LD is required.  
 
PROTOCOL3475 -250  
  
 
60 
 Stable  Disease  is any condition not meeting  the above  criteria.   Patients with a stable disease 
response or better (CR, PR) will be eligible to continue onto maintenance therapy with 
pembrolizumab.  
 
Inevaluable  for response is defined  as having  no repeat  tumor assessments  following  
initiation  of study  therapy  for reasons  unrelated  to symptoms  or signs of disease . 
 
Progression  (measurable  disease studies)  is defined  as ANY  of the following:  
 
• At least a 20%  increase  in the  sum of  LD target  lesions taking  as reference the 
smallest  sum LD recorded  since study  entry.  
• In the case where the ONLY  target  lesion  is a solitary  pelvic mass  measured  by 
[CONTACT_699156], a  50% increase in the  LD 
is required  taking  as reference the smallest  LD recorded  since study  entry.  
o The appearance of one  or more  new lesions.  
• Death  due to disease  without prior  objective documentation of  progression.  
• Global  deterioration  in health  status  attributable  to the  disease requiring  a change in 
therapy  without objective evidence of progression.  
• Unequivocal  progression of existing non-target  lesions, other  than pleural  effusions 
without cytological  proof  of neoplastic  origin,  in the  opi[INVESTIGATOR_699112]  (in this circumstance an  explanation  must  be provided).  
 
Recurrence  (non -measurable  disease studies ) is defined  as increasing  clinical,  
radiological  or histological  evidence  of disease since  study  entry.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Survival Times  
Survival  time is the observed  length  of life  from  entry  into the study  (first dose of therapy) to 
death  or the date of last contact.  
 
Progression -Free Survival  (measurable  disease  studies)  time is the  period  from  study  entry  
(first dose of therapy) until disease  progression,  death  or date of last contact.  PFS will be 
censored at the last assessment of disease progression for living patients.  
Recurrence -Free Survival  (non-measurable  disease  studies)  time is the  period  from  
study  entry  (first dose of therapy)  until disease recurrence,  death or  date of last contact.  
 
Overall  Survival  (OS)  time will be  defined  as observed  length  of life  from  entry  into the 
protocol  (first dose of therapy) to death,  or for living  patients, date of  last contact  (regardless  
of whether  or not this contact  [CONTACT_381366] a  subsequent  protocol).  Patients who do not progress 
during the survival follow -up will continue to be followed for ove rall survival via phone calls 
and/or chart until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent or lost to follow -up.

agent or protocol -specified procedure, whether investigational (incl uding placebo or active 
comparator medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by [CONTACT_266210].  
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006]  product in clinical trials or 
within the follow -up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, from 
overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  
Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre -allocation baseline period 
as a result  of a protocol -specified intervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual 
therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unless it is considered 
to be drug related by [CONTACT_11168].  
All adverse events will be recorded from the time the consent form is signed through 30 days 
following cessation of treatment and at each examination on the Adverse Event case report 
forms/worksheets.  The reporting timeframe for adverse even ts meeting any serious criteria is 
described in section [IP_ADDRESS].  
7.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose > 20% of 
the recommended [ADDRESS_949242] should be observed closely 
for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically 
indicated.  
If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006]  product , the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are 
met. 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006] ’s product  meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a  non-
serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.”  
Definition of overdose of carboplatin:    
PROTOCOL3475 -250

 The GFR  used in the Calvert formula to calculate AUC -based dosing should not exceed 1 25 
mL/min.  Maximu m carboplatin dose (mg) should not exceed target AUC (mg x min/mL) x 
150 mL/min.  In trials with AUC of 6 this would result in a maximum dose of 900 mg.   
Definition of overdose for paclitaxel:  
There is no established threshold identifie d as an overdose for paclitaxel.   
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor and within 2 working days  hours to  [COMPANY_006]  Global Safety . (Attn: Worldwide

immediately to the Sponsor  and to [COMPANY_006].  
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to the [COMPANY_006] 
Global Safety  facsimile number:  +1 -[PHONE_833]  
A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports is submitted as required by [CONTACT_8415], 
European Union (EU), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices agency (PMDA) or other local 
regulators. Investigators will cross reference this submission according to local  regulations to 
the [COMPANY_006] Investigational Compound Number (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of submission.  
Additionally investigators will submit a copy of these reports to [COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc. (Attn: 
Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220) at the time of sub mission to FDA.  
All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest 
(ECI) and must be recorded as such on the Ad verse Event case report forms/worksheets and 
reported within 24 hours to  the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety.  
(Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220)   Events of clinical interest for this trial 
include:  
1.  an overdose o f [COMPANY_006]  product, as defined in Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_949246] of protocol -specified laboratory testing or 
unscheduled laboratory testing.*  
PROTOCOL3475 -250

 *Note:   These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of a bnormal hepatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  The trial site guidance for assessment 
and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder  (or 
equivalent) . 
3.  Additional adverse e vents:  
 ECIs (both non -serious and serious adverse events) identified in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  from the 
date of first dose through 90 days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days after the 
initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, need t o be reported within 24 
hours to  the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety.  (Attn: Worldwide 
Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220) , regardless of attribution to study treatment, consistent 
with st andard SAE reporting guidelines.  
 Subjects should be assessed for possible ECIs prior to each dose.  Lab results should be 
evaluated and subjects should be asked for signs and symptoms suggestive of an immune -
related event.  Subjects who develop an ECI thought to be immune -related should h ave 
additional testing to rule out other etiologic causes.  If lab results or symptoms indicate a 
possible immune -related ECI, then additional testing should be performed to rule out other 
etiologic causes.  If no other cause is found, then it is assumed t o be immune -related.  
 
7.2.4 Evaluating Adverse Events  
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the 
NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Any adverse event 
which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_110507]/worksheets.  
All adverse ev ents regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.

Relationship 
to test drug  Did the [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event will be 
provided by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source docu ment or worksheet that 
supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initia led document 
must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as ref erence guidelines to assist the investigator in 
assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the available information.

compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in 
bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the [COMPANY_006] product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal 
product)?  
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not rea sonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host 
or environmental factors  
Relationship  The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the test drug and the AE: (continued)

product(s) is/are only used one t ime.)  
 Rechallenge  Was the subject re -exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is a 
single -dose drug trial); or (3) [COMPANY_006] product(s) is/are used only one time).  
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVENT WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH 
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY [CONTACT_80086], OR IF REEXPOSURE TO THE MERCK PRODUCT  
POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST

8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1  Planned Efficacy Evaluations  
8.1.1 Primary Efficacy Variables  
The primary efficacy variable is progression free survival  for suboptimally cytoreduced Stage 
III/IV ovarian cancer with combination platinum based chemotherapy and anti -PD-[ADDRESS_949251] scan may be performed at discretion of investigator if recurrent or 
progression of disease or symptoms warrant evaluation.   
Time to progression free s urvival (PFS) will be defined as date of completion of primary 
therapy to the date of first clinical, biochemical, or radiological evidence of progression or 
death due to any cause or to data of last assessment.  PFS will be censored at the last assessment  
of disease progression for living patients.  
8.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables  
• Overall survival  for suboptimally cytoreduced Stage III/IV ovarian cancer with 
combination platinum based chemotherapy and anti -PD-1 therapy followed by 
[CONTACT_699126] -PD-1 therapy  compared to historical controls.  
• Quality of life on maintenance anti -PD-1 therapy as measured with QOL (FACT -O) 
surveys at intervals during therapy  as noted in Trial Flow Chart  (Section 6.0) . 
8.1.3 Biomarker variables  
• The relationship of survival to the tumor m icroenvironment at the time of diagnosis for 
patients with suboptimally cytoreduced ovarian cancer using immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) staining for antibodies of PD -1 and PD -L1 in paraffin embedded tissue of tumor 
obtained at the time of their initial surgery   
• The relationship of survival and serial immune profiles from blood samples obtained 
post-surgery, prior to initiation of chemotherapy and during anti -PD-[ADDRESS_949252] one dose of  
study medication, whether withdrawn prematurely or not.  
 
8.2.2 Analysis Population  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The observed cases (OC)  
This will include all  patients  must have undergone tumor assessment at baseline, received at 
least the first cycle of pembrolizumab in combination with first line platinum based 
chemotherapy, and must have had at least one post -dose tumor assessment.  
This population (OC) will be the p rimary population for all analyses of primary and  
secondary efficacy variables of the observed cases (i.e. the actual assessments at each  
visit).  
 
PROTOCOL 3475 -250  
  
 
74 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  The completers population (CS)  
This will include the subset of OC who completed all treatments.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Per-protocol population  
The per -protocol population will be defined as the subset of the OC who completed all 
treatments and who did not have any major protocol violations (such as lack of compliance to 
the study medication schedule). The definitions of th ese protocol violations will be finalized 
before the database closure and will be documented in the analysis plan.  
8.3 Statistical Analysis  
8.3.1 Patient Demographics and Characteristics Data  
To evaluate comparability between study pa tients and historical controls regarding patient 
characteristics at baseline, demographic and disease characteristics will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. In addition, previous and concomitant diseases and medications will be  
summarized by [CONTACT_699161].  
All information will be listed by [CONTACT_19313]  (study or historical) and patient, and will be 
summarized. Frequencies will be presented for the categorical variables (e.g. race) and 
descriptive statistics will be presented for continuous variables (e.g. weight, age).  
8.3.2  Efficacy Variables  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical Method  
All efficacy data will be analyzed including CS patients. Per -protocol analysis will be done 
only if more than 10% of the CS patients do not qualify for the per -protocol analysis. For all  
efficacy variables, the baseline value will be defined as the last value taken p rior to the start of 
the first study medication.

[IP_ADDRESS].1.[ADDRESS_949254] model with clinical covariates such 
as interruption or not and age if the model is appropriate. If it is not appropriate , other

 [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_949255] incomplete data a cross scheduled time points. The method applied is also 
known as mixed -effects repeated measures analyses (MMRM).  
The primary model will include independent variables of the fixed, categorical effects of 
assessment visit, along with the continuous effects of baseline and baseline -by-assessment 
interaction up to week 4 . An unstructured variance -covariance structure will be used to model 
the within -patient errors and different variance -covariance structures will be tried for 
goodness -of-fit exploration. The 9 5% confidence intervals (CI) of change from baseline will 
be reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Tumor microenvironment at the time of diagnosis  
We will examine the relationship of PFS the for patients with suboptimally cytoreduced 
ovarian cancer with immunohistochemistry (IHC) st aining for antibodies of PD -1 and PD -L1

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_949256] -surgery, prior to initiation of chemotherapy and 
during anti -PD-1 maintenance.  
We will examine the trajectory of serum levels over time with plots. We will examine PFS 
using a generalized linear mixed model with survival a s a repeated outcome and cytokine levels  
as a time varying covariate s.  
We will look for a “signature” of cytokine levels that predicts PFS of 18 months or better using 
principal component analysis, un -supervised (using a factor approach) and supervised 
clustering. Further we will examine changes in the signature [CONTACT_48133].  
8.3.[ADDRESS_949257] primary efficacy measurement in the same assessment interval 
Patients who drop out or removed from the study due to an adverse symptom profile will be 
reported as a safety outcome.  
To allow for bias due to varying assessment times, symptomatic/ non-radiologic  events  and 
missing data due to lack of follow -up, sensitivity analyses as per Bhattacharya [48] will be

assumptions for the treatment arm and not for the historical controls in a comparison.  
8.3.4 Safety Data  
 
An investigator who is a qualified physician  will evaluate all adverse events according to the 
NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.  Any adverse event 
which changes the CTCAE grade over the course of a gi ven epi[INVESTIGATOR_699115].   All adverse events regardless of 
CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.   
The regimen would be considered unfeasible for further study if a  defini te drug related grade

terminate accrual early if sufficient evidence accumulates to consider the regimen unfeasible. 
The total accrual will be 30 patients. The study will use a 2-group sequential design to assess 
feasibility of delivering the study regimen. Fifteen (15) patients will be entered into each stage 
of the trial, unless excessive toxicity is observed in a previous stage. The decision rul es for 
whether or not to advance to the next stage of the study are summarized in the following table  
8.1: 
 
Table 8.1 Safety requirement  
Stage  Cumulative accrual  Minimum cumulative number of 
events to stop and consider regimen 
unfeasible  
1 15 5 in 15 patients  
2 30 10 in 30 patients  
 
In the case of a safety event suspending the study, a prompt cumulative examination of all 
data and circumstances of these events will be conducted by [CONTACT_699163], whether the proto col 
will be revised, or whether the study will be discontinued permanently.  
 
Each participating site’s IRB will be notified of any event that triggers postponement of 
enrollment in this study. If the study is suspended for safety reasons and it is deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_68490], approval from the relevant IRBs will be 
obtained prior to resuming the study at each participating institution.  
Decisions regarding ongoing study participation of patients on study will be made on a case 
by [CONTACT_699164]’s Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_699116].  
PROTOCOL [ADDRESS_949260]  at an alpha of

>1cm remaining post -surgery. We plan to accrue patients over [ADDRESS_949261] 80% power to detect at least an increase from [ADDRESS_949262] that the PFS is likely to be 24 months rather than 18 months 
and that would certainly be clinically significant and would consider this encouragement to 
pursue a larger study  as this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] . The sample size calculation was done using PASS 
11, with the sample size base on the work of Lakatos  [49, 50]. It was assumed that the percentage 
of dropouts in each group was 1% and the rate of accrual was uniform.

Duration of Study:
Short -term Period: 28 days (4 weeks) of screening, 168 days (24 weeks) of treatment, 42 days (6 weeks) of safety 
follow -up, for a total of approximately 238 days (34 weeks). Subjects randomized in toeither Part [ADDRESS_121224] dose of study medication.
Number of Subjects:
Approximately 450 subjects will need to be screened to randomize approximately 350 subjects. Utilizing a 
1:1:1:1:1 randomization scheme resulting in approximately 70 subjects in the each treatment arm. If the day85
interim analysis suggests an additional dose arm at a lower dose level needs to be added, then up to 40 additional 
subjects may be r andomized. 
Approximately 125 sites will participate in this study, which will be conducted globally and should include, but will 
not be limited to, participation of countries located in North America and Europe.
Study Population: Male and female subjects, ages18-70 years inclusive, satisfying the SLE classification criteria 
of the American College of Rheumatology (1982), as revised by [CONTACT_109394] 1997, with elevated titer of 
anti-nuclear antibodies at Screening, active features of SLE, including at lea st one adjudicated BILAG B or greater 
due to arthritis and/or inflammatory skin disease. Unless intolerant, subjects must be on background therapy for 
12weeks, on a stable dose for at least [ADDRESS_121225] one steroid sparing agent , including azath ioprine 
(AZA), leflunomide, methotrexate (MTX), anti-malarial agents , mycophenolate mofetil/ mycophenolic acid, which 
must remain on stable dose throughout the study. Prednisone is not required; however, ifsubject is taking 
prednisone (or prednisone -equiv alent), the maximum dose must not exceed 30mg/day of prednisone (orprednisone 
equivalent) at screening for a subject to be eligible and must be at a maximum of 10mg/day  for at least [ADDRESS_121226] SLE manifestations or other disorders expected to require increase in 
corticosteroids (CS) during the study. 
Wom en of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must not be nursing or pregnant and must be using an acceptable 
method of contraception for at least 4weeks before dosing. WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 
24hours prior to dosing with study medication

Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size: The sample size calculation is based on power to compare the proportion of subjects who achieve 
BICLA response (the BICLA response rate) at Day [ADDRESS_121227] 89% power to detect a 25% increase in the BICLA response rate in the active treatment 
arms(ie.50% response rate in BMS active arms)compared to the placebo and provide 74% power to detect 20% 
increase in the BICLA response rate in the active treatment arm (ie, 45% response rate in BMS active arm) 
compared to the placebo, assuming that the placebo arm has 25% response rate which is reasonable based on the 
EMBLEM phase 2 trial result.1No adjustment will be made for multiplicity. Subjects who discontinue 
trea
tment/study prior to Day 169 will contribute to the data that will be analyzed for BICLA response at Day 169 
(discontinuation will indicate no BICLA response). Therefore, no adjustment will be made for discontinuations.
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducte d on all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the 
study drug. In order to get 70 randomized and treated subjects per arm, an adequate numbers of subjects need to 
meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening.
If the interim analysis for futility and dose adaption suggests an additional dose arm at a lower dose level needs to be 
added, then up to 40 additional subjects may be randomized.

Analyses for the Short -term  Period :
Prim ary analysis :
The Chi-square tests will be used to compare the BICLA response rates at Day 169 betw een each of the active 
treatment arms and the placebo arm. The Chi-square p-value will be provided for each comparison betw een the 
active treatment and the p lacebo arm . In addition, the difference of the response rates between each active treatment 
and placebo will be estimated and their corresponding 90% confidence interval will be calculated. No adjustment 
will be made for multiplicity.
Secondary analysis:
Efficacy analysis :
Proportion of subjects who meet response criteria for the SLE Responder Index [SRI(4)], SRI(5) and SRI(6) ]at 
Day 169
Proportion of subjects who meet response criteria for the SLE Responder Index [SRI(4)], SRI(5) and SRI(6) ]at

Proportion of subjects with BICLA response at Day 85
Percentage of subjects with an im provement of> 4 or a decrease of > 50% from baseline in their CLASI score 
at Day 85 and Day 169
For each of the above endpoints, the estimate and its corresponding 90% confidence interval will be calculated for 
the difference of the proportions between each active treatm ent arm and the placebo arm at the specified visit, 
similar to the primary analysis.
For each of the following endpoints, the mixed effect model will be fit with treatment and visit as the fixed effects 
and measurements within each subject as the repeated measurements. The baseline value will be added into the 
model as a covariate if necessary. Based on the mixed effect model, the estimate and 90% confidence interval will 
be calculated for the difference betw een each active treatment and the placebo at each specified visit.

Interim analysis :
Interim Analysis for Safety/RO at Day [ADDRESS_121229] reached Day 29, an interim analysis (IA) for safety and RO will be performed.
The safety analysis will focus on inc idence and severity of all adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and pre -established 
Events of Special Interest such as infection AEs and any other safety analysis requested by [CONTACT_21469]. For RO: the 
median RO at Day [ADDRESS_121230] into Part 2 of the study. Specifically, dosing 
regimens originally included in Part 1 may be discontinued and/or new dosing regimens may be added according to 
the following criteria:
Safety:
The DMC in conjunction with an unblinded internal monitoring team may require one or more doses to be 
discontinued if stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_109367] m et or other safety  signals arise that the Medical Monitor and/ or DMC consider 
of sufficient concern.
Receptor Occupancy:
If median RO of any dose is <
20%, the sponsor may consider droppi[INVESTIGATOR_109368] ;
If the median RO for all doses is >90%,the sponsor may consider adding or replacing a dose in Part 2 of the 
study t o ensure an adequate pharmacodynamic range (dose not to exceed 12.5 mg weekly) .
Dose decrease and/or reduction of frequency of administration may also be considered if RO results fall outside the 
parameters indicated above. This adjustment may occur for safety reasons or in case unforeseen RO profiles 
observed in SLE patients. The decision to adjust dose and/or frequency will be taken after review  of the data by [CONTACT_109396].
Interim analysis for futility and dose adapt ationat Day 85 :
After 30 subjects per treatment arm (including the subject s from Part 1) have completed at least 84 days of the 
treatment period or discontinued the treatment, an interim analysis will be conducted to assess the futility of the 
BMS -931699 dose arm s and the overall safety . The results of the interim analysis will be reviewed by [CONTACT_109397]. The blinded study team will make the 
decision. The unblinded BMS team may recommend to:
Maintain the current des ign;
Drop a certain dose arm(s) and equally randomize the remaining unallocated subjects to the remaining arms;
Stop the study if all dose arms need to be dropped for safety or futility reasons.
The interim analysis for futility and dose adaption will be performed on the BICLA response at Day [ADDRESS_121231] not yet been observed will be similar to those observed for the subjects included inthe interim 
analysis at Day 85 and Day 169, respectively. As such,the unobserved data will be simulated from the predictive 
distribution conditional on the interim data and the prior distribution of the treatment difference (using a 
non-informative prior). Under the Bayesian frame work, the posterior distribution of the treatment difference 
(BMS -931699 active dose –Placebo) will be constru cted to determine the predictive probability of a successful 
outcome (ie, reach statistical significance) at Day 169. Based on computer simulations of the operating 
characteristics of thestudy design, the futility threshold in this interim analysis is setto 0.2. For the comparison of 
interest, if the predictive probability of a successful outcome at the planned end of the trial falls below 0.2, that 
BMS -931699 dose arm is deem ed futile in terms of BICLA response. However, the final futility will also 
incorporate the results from SRI(4), ACR28 and some biomarkers (C3, C4, ANA and anti -dsDNA). 
The proposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_109369], based on the futility assessment and the overall safety 
assessment, are as follows:
Rule 1: Drop the futile dose arm(s) and the dose arm cannot be dropped until the lower dose arm has been 
dropped.
Rule 2: Drop the dose arm(s) with safety issues identified;
Rule 3: If safety issues are identified in all dose arms or all dose arms are futile, stop the study.
In case dosing arms are dropped follow ing the interim analysis, the remaining unallocated subjects will be 
randomized into the remaining arms.
If the predictive probability of success for each active arm versus placebo is greater than or equal to 0.9, then the 
BMS team may also recommend adding an additional dose arm at lower dose level than current active doses to 
explore asuboptimal dose.
In that case, the remaining unallocated subjects with up to 40 additional subjects will be randomized into the 
remaining arms and the new dose arm based on the ne w random izations schedul e.
Analyses for the l ong-term extension period:
The LTE period starts when a subject receives at least one post Day [ADDRESS_121232] Day 169. 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Categorical param eters will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Continuous param eters will be 
summarized through means, SD, median, and range. The baseline (Day 1) is defined as the start of study medication 
(the same as baseline in Double -blind period). The baseline results will be based on LTE analysis population.
Efficacy Analyses
For continuous secondary endpoints (e.g. SLEDAI, MDGA etc.) point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for 
mean change from baseline to subsequent time points (in LTE period) within each treatment groups will be 
provided. For binary endpoints (BICLA Response, SRI(X) etc.), point estimates and 9 0% confidence intervals (CIs) 
will be provided using normal approximation within each treatment group. The assessment windows for LTE period 
will be based on the first LTE dose date; the baseline to assess responses or changes still refers to the Day 1 
assessment (the same as baseline in Short -term Period). The results will be presented by [CONTACT_6660]. All 
Analyses will be based on as-observed data; hence no imputation will be implem ented. No statistical testing 
including p -value computation w ill be pe rformed.
Safety Analyses
The evaluation of long term safety of the selected dose(s) will be based on clinical adverse events, vital signs and

DMC and internal safety monitoring activities initiated in Part 1 will continue into Part 2
and will be ongoing until the end of the study , including the long- term e xtension.
In summary , the potential overall benefit ratio for BMS -931699 treated subjects in this trial 
appears favorable. In order to minimize the overall risk to participating subj ects, this protocol has 
inclusion and exclusion criteria appropriate to the population and proposed treatments , 
exclusionary  screening tests [chest x-ray, Quantiferon Gold testing (or other interferon gamma 
release assay test, such as T-SPOT ) wherever appropriate, risk factor/age specific breast 
screening, medical history ], and specific follow -up safety  assessments. In addition, the AEs and 
SAEs will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_109402] a ny safet y issues.
2 ETHICA L CONSIDERA TIONS
2.1 Good Clinical Practice

underly ing European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50).
The study  will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any amendments 
and the subject informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board/I ndependent Ethics 
Committee (I RB/IEC) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_52194] .
All potential serious breaches must be reported to BMS immediatel y. A serious breach is a 
breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study  or the protocol, 
2.[ADDRESS_121235] or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment). 
2.[ADDRESS_121236]/Independent Ethics Committee 
Before study  initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_20291]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recru itment material s 
(eg,advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to subje cts. The 
investigator or BMS should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigat or Brochure 
or product labeling information to be provided to subjects and an y updates. 
The investigator or BMS should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other 
information (eg, expedited safet y reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to 
regulatory  requirements or i nstitution procedures .
2.[ADDRESS_121237] ensure that subjects are clearl y and fully  informed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate. 
In situation s where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally  acceptable representatives
(as per country  guidelines) are clearl y and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and
other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject volunteers to participate. 
BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Local) sample informed 
consent form (s)which will include all elements required by  [CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable regulatory  
requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

If informed consent is initially  given by a subject’s legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently  becomes capable of making and communicating his 
or herinformed consent during the study , consent must additionally  be obtained from the 
subject.
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study  and of any new information relevant to the 
subjec t's willingness to continue participation in the study . This communication should be 
documented. 
The confidentiality  of records that could identify  subjects must be protected, respecting the 
privacy  and confidentiality  rules applicable to regulatory  requirements, the subjects' signed ICF 
and, in the US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form (s)must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory  authorities have 
direct access to subject records. 
Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or subjects with or severe dementia) may  
only be enrolled in the study  with the consent of a legally  acceptable representative. The subject 
must also be informed about the nature of the study  to the extent compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or she should personall y sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a subject who is unable to give his or 
her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_52195], or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study  at any time should be 
considered b y the investigator.
The rights, safet y, and well -being of the study  subjects are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.
3 INVESTIGA TIONA L PLA N
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a Phase 2, parallel- arm, randomized, double -blinded, multicenter, international study , 
with an adaptive design.
The study  will comprise a short -term period (Part 1 and Part 2), and a long -term extension (L TE) 
period.
Part 1 of the short -term period will focus on assessing safet y and RO and will be limited to a 
maximum of 50 patients (approximately  6-10 patients/arm) who will be included in the 
Safety /RO interim analysis (IA). These patients will continue study  treatment beyond the IA for 
Safety /RO and be treated for up to 24 weeks and be followed for 6 additional weeks after 
treatment is completed. Treatment could be shorter if IA for Safet y/RO analy sis indicates one or 
more arms should be dropped.

Part 2of the short- term period will start once cumulative safet y profile is considered acceptable 
and RO data for 6 -10 subjects per cohort dosed for >28 day s is available and the interim anal ysis
from Part 1is completed. Approximately  300 subjects will be randomized into this part of the 
study (number of patient to be randomized into Part 2 may increase based on the results of the 
futility  interim anal ysis). 
All subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility  and allow down titration 
of predni sone (or prednisone equivalent) prior to administration of study  medication . The 
screening period will have a duration of approximately  28 days (+/-2 days).All eligibility  
criteria must be met prior to Day 1. In the event of technical difficulties leading inconclusive 
assessments that would go beyond the allowed window, the study  medical monitor must be 
consulted prior to conducting Day 1.On Day 1, eligibil ity of subjects will be confirmed and
eligible subjects will receive their first dose of study  medication.
Dose may be adapted based on results of the planned interim analy ses from Part 1 and Part 2, as 
follows:
Safety  and RO interim analysis: safety  and RO analy sis will be performed when 
approximately  [ADDRESS_121238] reached Study  Day29. Based on the results of 
this analy sis, dose arms (s)may be adjusted or may be dropped .
Interim analysis for futility and dose adapt ation on BICLA response, SRI response, 
ACR28 and some SLE biomarkers (such as auto-antibodies, complement levels, etc.) with 
possible exploratory  exposure response analy sis, will be performed when approximately 
30subjects per arm have reached Study  Day 85 (12 weeks) , including subjects from Part [ADDRESS_121239] discontinued prior to reaching study  Day 85). Analy sis will
be performed by [CONTACT_109391], while maintaining blind at the site and subject
level. Based on the results, t he dose levels and sample size may  be modified.
Ongoing assessment of safet y will be performed by [CONTACT_105231] (DMC) and an internal unblinded safety  monitoring team. Both entities may 
make recommendations to the Sponsor regard ing conduct of study  and dose adjustment based 
on safet y observations.
Following interim analyses and DMC reviews, dose arm(s) may be modified based on the 
results, as follows:
If one or more arms are added, future randomizations will include the new arm(s). 
If one or more arms are dropped for safet y reasons, randomization into that arm will be 
terminated and all subjects currentl y randomized to that or those arm(s) will be discontinued
from receiving stud y medicati on.
If one or more armsaredropped due to inadequate RO, there will be no new randomizations 
into that dose arm; subjects currentl y randomized may continue at the Investigator discretion . 
Thelong-term extension (LTE) period is optional andwill include eligible subjects who have 
completed Day 169 (week 24) of treatment and consent to participate . This period of the study 
will remain blinded but will no longer have a placebo arm. Eligible subjects will remain on their

Placebo- arm subjects will be re-randomized into one of the existing active arms at Day 169
(24weeks ). Re-randomization of the placebo subjects will be done by [CONTACT_109403]/drug preparer will know the new randomization arm. The LTE will remain 
blinded to the study  team and study  personnel. 
The long-term extension period will not have interim analy ses for dose adaptation. However, the 
BMS unblinded safet y committee will continue to review the safety  data and discuss itwith the 
DMC (also unblinded), as needed. During their evaluation of adverse events, if a significant 
safet y concern is identified, these two committees may propose that one or more dose arms are 
dropped. If one or more dose arms are dropped for safet y reasons, all subjects currentl y receiving 
that or those dose (s) will be discontinued from receiving study  medication.

(FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Females treated with hormone replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely  to have artificiall y 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgment in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH levelis > 40 mlU/ml at any time 
during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal.

and/or for more than 7 days (short -term period) or more than 14 days (long -term extension 
period) . 
Patients 
should discontinue from study , perform End of Treatment and Follow -up Day [ADDRESS_121263] immediately  notify  the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. If any female subject becomes pregnant she will be immediately 
discontinued from the study .
All subjects who discontinue investig ational product should compl y with protocol specified 
follow -up procedures as outlined in Section 5. The only exception to this requirement is when a 
subject withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-treatment study  follow -
up or 
loses the ability  to consent freel y (ie,is imprisoned or involuntaril y incarcerated for the treatment 
of either a ps ychiatric or phy sical illness ).

[IP_ADDRESS] Administration Window
Asubject’s scheduled dosing may be administered within [ADDRESS_121279]’s and/or the site personnel’s convenience. 
Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for dose modifications in the presence of an adverse event. 
4.5.2 Dose modifications
[IP_ADDRESS] BMS -[ADDRESS_121280]’s scheduled dosing may be administered within ± [ADDRESS_121281]’s and/or the site personnel’s convenience.
If the study  medication cannot be administered within 2days of the target date, that 
scheduled dose should be skipped, which means subject will miss one (1) dose. The next 
dose of study  medication should then be administered on the next targeted administration day
(2days)as originally  planned. For example, the Day 15dose could not be administered 
until Day  17and subject comes to the study  site to receive it on Day  19. The planned Day  15
dose should not be given at Day 19and the next dose will be administered on Day 22
(2days). In this example, one missed dose will be re ported in the eCRF.
Dose Modifications for Adverse Events
If there is evidence of toxicity  (eg, abnormal laboratory  tests or clinical adverse events) that, in 
the judgment of the Investigator, could place the subject at increased risk, study  drug 
administration should be interrupted. Subjects may  be considered el igible to receive further study 
medication treatment only  if full resolution of the adverse event is documented, as follows: 
If the adverse event completely  resolves and the study  medication is administered within 
2days of the target date, the next dose should be administered on the originall y planned 
dosing day  with no missed doses.
If the adverse event completely  resolves but study  medication cannot be administered within 
2days of the target date, that scheduled dose should be skipped (which means subject will 
miss one (1) dose). The next dose of study  medication should then be administered on the 
next targeted administration day as originall y planned (2 days).For example, the Day 15
dose could not be administered until Day 17and adverse event resol ution occurs on Day 19. 
The planned Day 15dose should not be given at Day 19and the next dose will be 
administered on Day 22(2 days).In this example, one missed dose will be reported in the 
eCRF.

10mg/day  for at least 5 days prior to Day  1 (randomization day ).
Study  Day 1  (randomization day): subjects requiring the use of prednisone (or prednisone 
equivalent) will be on a maximum dose of 10mg/day .
Post Day  1 (after initiation of study  therapy ): 
For subjects who flare or need to increase their prednisone (or prednisone equivalent) to 
control disease activity a one-time increase of up to a maximum daily dose of 20mg/day
for up to 2 consecutive days will be allowed to transiently  manage disease activity .
A subject who requires a total daily dose of prednisone (or prednisone equivalent) 
exceeding 20mg/day or who has another flare after the first rescue therapy , will be 
considered a treatment failure .
A subject who meets the treatment failure criteria as described above may continue on 
study medication ; however, a subject requiring more than 20 mg/day of prednisone 
(orprednisone equivalent) for more than [ADDRESS_121282] dose of study drug, prednisone 
(orprednisone -equivalent) may be tapered down at the discretion of the I nvestigator.
4.5.4 Rescue Therapy
[IP_ADDRESS] Short -Term Period
A one-time increase of up to a maximum daily  dose of 20 mg/day  for up to 2 consecutive days 
will be allowed to transiently  manage disease activity and will not be considered a treatment 
failure . 
A subject who requires a total daily dose of prednisone (or prednisone equivalent) 
exceeding 20 mg/day or who has another flare after the first rescue therapy , will be 
considered a treatment failure. 
A subject who meets the treatment failure criteria based on prednisone use may continue 
on study  medication; however, a subject requiring more than 20 mg/day of prednisone 
(orprednisone equivalent) formore than 7 daysin the short -term period, will be 
discontinued.
The use of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_109376] (or prednisone equivalent), such as

4.6 Blinding/Un blinding
4.6.1 Blinding at the Study Sites
The subjects and clinical assessor(s) will not be aware of which treatment is being administered 
to the subjects enrolled in the study . The pharmacist (or qualified drug preparation person) will 
be unblinded to study  medication (BMS -931699 or placebo).
The pharmacist (or qualified drug preparation person) will know the randomization assignments 
and prepare the appropriate dose of active BMS -[ADDRESS_121284]’s management, the blind for that subject may be 
broken by [CONTACT_093]. The subject’s safety  takes priori ty over any other considerations in 
determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject’s treatment, the investigator should determine 
that the unblinded information is necessary , ie, that it will alter the subject’s immediate 
management. In many cases, particularl y when the emergency  is clearly  not related to the 
investigational product, the problem may be properly  managed by [CONTACT_82745]. It is highly  desira ble that the decision to unblind treatment assignment 
be discussed with the Medical Monitor, but the investigatory  alway s has ultimate authority  for 
the decision to unblind. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_109377].
For this study , the method of unblinding for emergency  purposes is IVRS.
For information on how to unblind in an emergency, consult the IVRS manual.
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_22951] M onitor and ensure every  attempt is made 
to preserve the blind.
Any request to unblind a subject for non-emergency  purposes should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.

In case of an emergency , the I nvestigator(s) has unrestricted access to randomization i nformation 
via the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) and is capable of breaking the blind through 
the IVRS system without prior approval from sponsor. Following the unblinding the Investigator 
shall notify  the Medical Monitor and/or Study  Director.

4.8 Destruction of Study  Drug
For this study , study  drugs (those supplied by [CONTACT_52240]) such as 
partially  used study  drug containers, vials and s yringes may be destroy ed on site. 
Any unused study  drugs can only be destro yed after being inspected and reconciled by [CONTACT_52241] y, or to meet local regulations (eg, cytotoxics or biologics). 
On-site destruction is allowed provided the following minimal standards are met:
On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from the drug.
On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any  special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
Written procedures for on-site disposal are available and followed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s SOPs and a cop y provided to BMS upon request.
Records are maintained that allow for traceability  of each container, including the date 
disposed of, quantity  disposed, and identification of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposa l, ie, incinerator, licensed sanitary  landfill, or licensed waste disposal 
vendor must be documented.
Accountability  and disposal records are complete, up-to-date, and available for the Monitor 
to review throughout the clinical trial period.
If conditions for destruction cannot be met the responsible BMS Study  Monitor will make 
arrangements for return of study  drug.
It is the investigator’s responsibility  to arrange for disposal of all empty  containers, provided that 
procedures for proper disposal have bee n established according to applicable federal, state, local, 
and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are 
kept.
4.9 Return of Study Drug
If study  drug will not be destro yed upon completion or termination of the study , all unused 
and/or partially  used study  drug that was supplied by [CONTACT_20458]. The return 
of study  drug will be arranged by  [CONTACT_109418].

5.1.2 Period
A single -retesting of laboratory  parameters and/or other assessments during Screening period 
will be permitted (in addition to any parameters that require a confirmatory  value), only if 
medically  indicated, if there is evidence a laboratory  sample was mislabeled, was inadequatel y 
processed and/or deteriorated in transit to the central laboratory .
Any new result will override the previous result (ie, the most current result prior to 
Randomization) and is the value by [CONTACT_109419], as it represents the 
subject’s most current, clinical state. This will also apply  to subjects who are being re -screened.
5.2 Study Materials
The site will provide all required materials for the tests performed locally  (ie, relevant clinical 
laboratory  tests). The site will have available a well -calibrated scale for recording body  weight, a 
12-lead ECG machine, and a calibrated sphy gmomanometer and thermo meter for vital signs 
assessments. The site will have urine collection containers, a centrifuge, a heated plaque, a 
monitored and alarmed refrigerator, and freezer (-20°C or below), as well as containers and dry 
ice for shipment and storage of blood and urine samples. The site will provide all materials 
required for accurate source documentation of study  activities.
BMS will provide a BMS -approved protocol and any amendments or administrative letters 
(if required), and investigator brochure. Case report forms (electronic or hard copy) will be 
provided by [CONTACT_20444]. Ten centimeter rulers will be provided by [CONTACT_109420]’s Global Assessment of disease activity  on the Case Report Form.
All Investigator sites within this study  will use an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) tool to submit 
study  data to BMS. Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will be prepared for all data 
collection fields at Investigator sites, except for fields specific to Pregnancy  Forms. Pregnancy  
Forms will be submit ted to BMS using paper CRFs. Subject Quality  of Life Questionnaires will 
be completed by [CONTACT_109421]. Physician Global Assessment of disease activity  worksheet will be 
completed by [CONTACT_109422]. Subject completed 
Quality  of Life Questionnaires will be retained at the investigational site. 
Study  supplies and documents (eg, electronic Case Reports Forms, patient drug log s, etc.) will be 
provided to the study  center by [CONTACT_20444]. Urine pregnancy  test kits, laboratory  specimen collection 
kits and instructions for collection will be provided by [CONTACT_109423]. IVRS

Visit” procedures performed and should return to the clinical for the “Follow -Up Visit” 
approximately  42 days after the “End of Treatment Visit”. All procedures required for these 
visits should be completed as well as collection of concomitant medication information.
All assessments should be performed or administered prior to study drug administration 
unless otherwise indicated. Furthermore, patient ’s assessments (ie FACIT -F, SF
-[ADDRESS_121298]’s Global Assessment) must be performed prior to all other assessments.
Every  effort must be made to ensure the same evaluator will complete the assessments for each 
subject at all visits.
Only  data for the procedures and assessments specified in this protocol should be submitted to 
BMS on a case report form. Additional procedures and assessments may be performed as part of 
your institutional or medical practice standard of care; however, data for these assessments 
should remain in the subject’s medical record and should not be provided to BMS, unless 
specificall y requested from the sponsor.
Safety Outcome Measures: Safety  assessments will be based on medical review of adverse 
event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, ECGs, physical examinations, and 
clinical laboratory  tests. The incidence of observed adverse events will be tabulated and 
reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance.
Ongoing assessment of safet y will be performed by [CONTACT_23275] 
(DMC) and an internal safet y monitoring team. Both entities may make recommendations to the 
Sponsor regarding conduct of study  and dose adjustment based on safet y observations.
Titers of anti-CMV and EBV antibodies will be obtained at baseline, [ADDRESS_121299] Assessments
For the short- term period (Part 1 and Part 2), a central laboratory  will perform the analy ses and 
will provide reference range s for these tests.
Clinical L aboratory  Testing
Blood and/or urine samp les will be obtained prior to injection at all visits from each subject 
entered in this study . Any laboratory test result that the Investigator considers clinically 
relevant should be recorded on the appropriate Adverse Event 
page of the CRF
(seeSection 6.3Laboratory  Test Result Abnormalities) .
2.[ADDRESS_121300] 10 hours prior to the collection 
time, subjects should not consume food; only water is allowed. Subjects with an abnormal Lipid 
Panel may  be referred back to their primary  care provider for further management if warranted.
Urine or serum pregnanc y tests will be performed within [ADDRESS_121301] becomes pregnant she will be immediatel y discontinued from the 
study .
If a WOCBP advises the investigational staff that she has had amenorrhea for 12 consecut ive 
months while the study  is ongoing and menopause is a diagnostic consideration, a serum follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) level should be taken and testing performed at the central laboratory  
to determine if her FSH level is > 40 mIU/mL . After the level has been confirmed and the 
diagnosis of menopause has been determined by a treating physician, pregnancy  testing at each 
visit will no longer be required for the subject as she is no longer of child -bearing potential. 
If additional or follow -up monitori ng of subject safety, eg, potential toxicity or features of 
active SLE is required, the investigator may obtain samples for additional laboratory tests 
if deemed necessary after discussion with the BMS study team.

5.3.4 Physical Examination
Complete and/or interim physical examinations may be performed by a Doctor of Medicine 
(MD), or someone who is authorized to perform the examinations by [CONTACT_109425]. While the interim phy sical examination may  not 
be as comprehensive as the initial full examination, key aspects of the interim examination 
should evaluate important body  systems as clinically  indicated. These body  systems can include 
lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and breast at the discretion of the examiner. An interim physical 
examination may note any changes in the subject’s condition (body systems) since the last 
assessment and does not preclude examination of any  of the body  systems as clinically  indicated.
Every effort should be made to ensure the same evaluator will complete the phy sical examination 
for each subject at all visits throughout the study . Documentation of who performed the 
examination is to be recorded in source notes.
5.4 Efficacy  Assessments
Clinica l assessments of response should be performed by [CONTACT_109426](s) and at 
approximately  the same time ofday throughout the duration of the stud y. 
5.4.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment
[IP_ADDRESS] Short -Term Period
Primary  efficacy  assessment is a composite endpoint, the BICLA, which includes BILAG -2004, 
SLEDAI -2K (30 day)20,Physician Global Assessment of disease activity  (MDGA) and no 
treatment failure. The BILAG -2004 index was selected as the central score on the basis of its 
comprehensiveness, ability  to capture partial improvement, and the clinical relevance of its 
scoring system. BILAG assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_473], and grades will be 
determined b y an independent central reader group.
[IP_ADDRESS] Long -Term Extension Period
Primary  efficacy  assessments during the long-term extension will be the same as in the 
short -term period, in order to assess long -term durability  of response.
5.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] Short -Term Period
Training and instruction on BILAG 2004 index assessment will be provided and discussed at the 
Investigator’s Meeting or at workshops. The response measure (BILAG) will be reviewed and 
discussed with the investigational staff at the Investigator Meeting or other forum as a method of 
standardizing the grading between the investigational staffs. All Investigative site personnel 
performing BILAG evaluations must be trained and certified. 
The BILAG index measures and reports disease activity  in different organs/sy stems separately . 
The BILAG score is calculated for each of nine systems depending on the clinical features 
2.[ADDRESS_121307] 4 weeks compared 
with previously . A BILAG “A” represents the presence of one or more serious features of lupus. 
A BILAG “B” represents more moderate features of the disease. A BILAG “C” includes only 
mild symptomatic features. A BILAG “D” represents only prior activity  with no current 
symptoms due to active lupus. A BILAG “E” represents an organ that has never been involved. 
Assessments used to determine BILAG score must be performed by [CONTACT_737], or a 
BILAG certified (an individual who has passed the BMS sponsored BILAG Certification Test) 
Sub-Investigator. The Sub-Investigator may be a Doctor of Medicine (MD), or someone who is 
authorized to perform the examinations by [CONTACT_109427]. Changes in therapy  based on any  clinical or laboratory assessment must be 
approved b y the Investigator or a MD/DO Sub- Investigator.
[IP_ADDRESS] Long -Term Extension Period
Secondary  efficacy  assessments during the long-term extension will be the same as in the short -
term period, in order to assess long -term durability of response.
5.5 Pharmacokinetic A ssessments
5.5.1 Short -Term Period
Pharmacokinetics of BMS -931699 will be derived from serum concentration versus time data. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters to be reported include Ctrough (ng/mL), which will be 
measured from serum samples collected as defined Table 5.5.[ADDRESS_121308]-dose samples cannot 
be obtained at these times (ie ,Days 46 + Day 48), the 2 samples may  be obtained on (Day s 60 + 
Day 62) OR (Day s 74 + Day 76). 
Population PK (PPK) analy sis maybe performed using PK data from the current proposed study  
in SLE patients. Results of the PPK analysis may also be used to characterize the 
exposure -response (E-
R) relationship in BMS -931699 by [CONTACT_109428] /safet y data. Further, theeffect of covariates (demographic and 
clinical) on efficacy /safety  may be explored in the E-R analyses. Results of the PPK and E-R 
analyses will be reported separately  if performed.

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered study  drug and that 
does notnecessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related tothe study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The ca usal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.
Adverse events ca
n be spontaneously  reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be

questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs). BMS, as sponsor of the study , 
commits to declare safety  events in accordance with the regulation in force in each country .
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109382] g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(seeNOTE below)
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) 
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  
drug is an SAE.
Although pregnanc y,overdose , cancer ,and potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) are not 
alway s serious by [CONTACT_52252], these events must be handled asSAE s. 
(See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study  endpoint that is considered related to study  therap y (eg, death is an 
endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphy laxis, anaphy laxis must be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52205]: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life- threatening event)
elective surgery , planned prior to signing consent
admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine colonoscop y)

medical/surgical admission other than to remedy  ill health and planned prior to entry  into 
the study . Appropri ate documentation is required in these cases
admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy , caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family  circumstances, administrative reason ).
Admission for administration of anticancer therapy  in the absence of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safet y 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting.
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures . All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 42daysof discontinuation of dosing .
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed 
to be related to stud y drug or protocol -specified procedure.
An SAE report should be completed for an y event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study
procedure ), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
(ordesignee) within [ADDRESS_121310] be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on 
a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred method for SAE data 
reporting collection is through the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy  surveillance forms are only 
intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system is not functioning. In this case, the paper 
forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number :Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used and submitted immediately , only 
in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper forms are used, 
the original paper forms are to remain on site .
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy  reporting) : Refer to Contact 
[CONTACT_20491].
If only  limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.)

If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drugor if new inform ation 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS 
(ordesignee) u sing th e same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious A dverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of non serious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. Non serious 
AEinformation should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug andfor those present at the end of study  treatment 
as appropriate. Allidentified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF ( paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the course o f the study .
6.[ADDRESS_121311] result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
Any laboratory  test result abnormality  that required the subject to have study  drug 
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory  test result abnormality  that required the subject to receive specifi c corrective 
therap y.
It is expected that whenever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory  term would be used by 
[CONTACT_9673] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.[ADDRESS_121312] immediately  notify  the BMS 
Medical Monitor/de signee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance 
Form to BMS Designee within [ADDRESS_121313] unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663]  (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated.
The investigat or must immediately  notify  the BMS (or designee) Medical Monitor of this event 
and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form to BMS (or designee) within [ADDRESS_121314] be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injur y (DILI)
Whenever possible, timely  confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND 
2.Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_121315], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND 
3.No other immediatel y apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other d rug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety  Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiogram, x-ray filming, any other potential safet y assessment required or not required

6.7.1 AE’s of Special Interest
Although there are no identified risks for BMS -931699, BMS has developed a list of events of 
special interest for the BMS -[ADDRESS_121316] for this 
study  may  include, but are not limited to:
Infections
Autoimmunity
Malignancies
Injection -related reactions
Note: Another event of special interest based on the biologic class effect, albeit not an adverse 
event in itself, is Immunogenicity , which will be monitored during the entire study . Adverse 
events in subjects who develop anti-BMS -931699 antibodies will be monitored as AE’s of 
special interest .
7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE A ND OTHER EXTE RNA L 
COMMITTEES
An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be used in this study . The Committee’s 
scope of responsibility will belimited to monitoring safety by [CONTACT_68112]; 
Committee may  request treatment codes and/or efficacy  summaries if indicated for safet y/benefit 
assessment. The Committee will comprise [ADDRESS_121317] been dosed . From that time, DMC monitoring 
will be performed approximately  every 6-8weeks (during Part 1) and quarterl y during Part2 
(with the agreement of DMC and BMS ,this schedule may be changed depending on the rate of 
subject accrual ). The DMC will review safet y data including serious adverse events and events 
of special interest (eg, infections) , focusing on early signal detection. The DMC will also 
evaluate the rates of observed increases of clinical disease activity  of SLE and opportunistic 
infections compared to the backg round rates expected in this study  population based on a review 
of the relevant literature. Further details on the content and methods of data reports to the DMC 
will be outlined in the Charter of that Committee along with the processes and procedures the 
committee will follow.
In collaboration with the DMC, an unblinded internal safet y monitoring team will review the 
safet y data throughout the study and will provide recommendations to the blinded study  team.
An Adjudication Committee will be used in this study. Scope of responsibility  will include, but 
will not be limited to, adjudication of SLE eligibility  criteria, new “A” and “B” BILAG flares
and cross -validation of the instruments used in this study  to assess the disease being studied.

8 STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
The sample size calculation is based on power to compare the proportion of subjects who 
achieve BICLA response (the BICLA response rate) at Day [ADDRESS_121318] 89% power 
to detect a 25% increase in the BICLA response rate in the active treatment arm(s)[(ie,50% 
response rate in BMS active arm(s)]compared to placebo , and provide 74% power to detect a 
20% increase in the BICLA response rate in the active treatment arm(s)[(ie, 45% response rate 
in BMS active arm) ]compared to placebo, assuming that the placebo arm has 25% response rate 
which is reasonable based on the EMBLEM phase 2trial result s21. No adjustment will be made 
for multiplicity .Subjects who discontinue treatment/study  prior to Day  169 will contribute to the 
data that will be analyzed for BICLA response at Day 169 (discontinuation will indicate no 
BICLA resp onse). Therefore, no adjustment will be made for discontinuations.
The primary  efficacy  analysis will be conducted on all randomized patients who received at least 
one dose of the study  drug. In order to get 70 randomized and treated subjects per arm, an 
adequate number of subjects will need to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening.
If the interim analysis for futility  and dose adapt ation suggests thatan additional dose arm (at a 
lower dose level ) needs to be added, then up to 40 additional s ubjects may  be randomized.
8.2 Populations for A nalyses
All Enrolled Subjects, defined as all subjects who sign an informed consent;
All Randomized Subjects, defined as all subjects who are randomized to a treatment; 
All Treated Subjects, defined as all subjects who receive at least one dose of study treatment;
Biomarker Analysis Population, defined as all subjects that receive any  study  medication and 
have at least [ADDRESS_121319]- treatment biomarker measurement. 
Pharmacokinetic Population, defined as all subjec ts who receive any study  medication and 
have an y available concentration- time data. 
Immunogenicit y Population, defined as all subjects who receive study  drug and have at least 
1post treatment immunogenicity  measurement.
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study  treatment (all treated subjects) will be 
included in the safet y analy sis population and the efficacy  analysis population. However, the 
subjects from Part 1 who are randomized to a treatment arm that is discontinued based on the 
Part1 Sa fety/RO analy sis will be excluded from the efficacy  analysis. More details will be 
provided in the statistical anal ysis plan.

Clinical Protocol IM128027

Safety :
The DMC in conjunction with an unblinded internal monitori ng team may require one or more 
doses to be discontinued if stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_109383]/or DMC consider of sufficient concern.
Receptor Occupancy :
If median RO of an y dose is < 20%, the sponsor may  consider droppi[INVESTIGATOR_109368]
If the median RO for all doses is > 90% the sponsor may  consider adding or replacing a dose 
in Part 2 of the study  to ensure an adequate pharmacod ynamic range (dose not to exceed 
12.5 mg weekl y)
Dose decrease and/or reduction offrequency  of administration may also be considered if RO 
results fall outside the parameters indicated above. This adjustment may  occur for safety  reasons 
or in case unforeseen RO profiles observed in SLE patients. The decision to adjust dose and/or 
frequ ency  will be taken after review of the data by [CONTACT_6098].
8.6.2 Interim Analysis for Futility and Dose Adaption at Day 85
After 30 subjects per treatment arm(including the subjects from Part 1)have completed at least 
84days of the treatment period or discontinued the treatment, an interim analysis will be 
conducted to assess the futility  of the BMS -931699 dose arms and the overall safet y. The results 
of the interim analysis will be reviewed by [CONTACT_109431]. The blinded study  team will make the decision. The 
unblinded BMS team may  recommend to:
maintain the current design;
drop a certain dose arm(s) and equall y randomize the remaining unallocated subjects to the 
remaining arms;
stop the study  if all dose arms need to be dropped for safety  or futility  reasons.
The interim analysis for futility and dose adaption will be performed on the BICLA response at 
Day [ADDRESS_121323] not yet been observed will be similar to what were observed for the subjects included at the 
interim analysis at Day 85 and Day 169, respectively . As such the unobserved data will be 
simulated from the predictive distribution conditional on the interim data and the prior 
distribution of the treatment difference (using a non-informative prior). Under the Bayesian 
framework, the posterior distribution of the treatment difference (BMS -931699 active dose –
Placebo) will be constructed to determine the predictive probability  of a successful outcome 
(ie,reach statistical significance) at the planned end of the trial for each dose arm. Based on 
computer simulations of the operating characteristics of the study  design, the futility  threshold in 
this interim analy sis is set to 0.2. For the comparison of interest, if the predictive probability of a

successful outcome at the planned end of the trial falls below 0.2, that BMS -931699 dose arm is 
deemed futile in terms of BICLA response. However, the final futility  will also incorporat e the 
results from SRI (4), ACR28 and some biomarkers (C3, C4, ANA and anti- dsDNA). 
The proposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_109384], based on the futility  assessment and the 
overall safety assessment, are as follows:
Rule 1: Drop the futile dose arm(s) and the dose arm cannot be dropped until the lower dose 
arm has been dropped.
Rule 2: Drop the dose arm(s) with safet y issues identified;
Rule 3: If safet y issues are identified in all dose arms orall dose arms are futile, stop the 
study .
In case dosing arms are dropped following the interim analysis, the remaining unallocated 
subjects will be randomized into the remaining arms.
If the predictive probability  of success for each active arm versus placebo is greater than or equal 
to 0.9, then the BMS team may also recommend adding an additional dose arm at lower dose 
level than current active doses to explore the suboptimal dose.
In that case, the remaining un-allocated subjects with up to [ADDRESS_121324] Day  169 dose. The anal ysis based

Expanded definition Complete abstinence as defined as 
complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse is an 
acceptable form of cont raception for all study  drugs. This 
also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifesty le 
of the patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence 
(eg,calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, profession of 
abstinence for entry  into a clinical trial, post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods 
of contraception. Subjects who choose complete abstinence 
are not required to use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy  tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highl y effective 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject 
chooses to forego complete abstinence.
Medical Research Those scientific activities which cannot be reasonably  
anticipated at the time of trial design, for which we would 
like to collect and/or retain samples from study  participants. 
Examples of Medical Research include, but are not limited

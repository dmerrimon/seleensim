1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHE MA 
 
In this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  [ADDRESS_603235]- 
operatively  with intrathecal  131-I-3F8, red uced-dose external  beam  radiation  therapy 
(1800 cGy craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]  + primary site boost to 5400 cGy via  IMRT), and standard 
chemotherapy  (vincristine,  lomustine,  cisplatin).  
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIF IC AIMS  
 
• To assess t he feasibility  of combining  intrathecal radioimmunotherapy  with 
external  beam  radiation  therapy  and chemotherap y. 
 
• To maintain  or exceed  the current  progress ion-free survival  rate for patients  with 
standard -risk medulloblasto ma while  using  the protocol -prescribed  regimen that is 
hypothesized  to have less long -term serious morbidit y. 
 
• To evaluate  the long-term morbidities  in patients treated with this regimen, with 
specific  attention  to neuropsychological,  neuroendocrine,  audio metric and growth 
outco mes. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_603236] been estimated to represent  20 to  25% of pediatric  brain  tumors. SEER  data have 
suggested  that approximately  317 cases  of medulloblasto ma are diagnosed  in patien ts 
aged 0 to 24 years  in the United  States per year, with approxi mately 218 in  the group 3 to  
24 years  old. Approxi mately 1/[ADDRESS_603237] -risk (the 
group of subjects  to be involved  in this study)  is defined  as the  absence  of metastatic 
disease  (disease  beyond  the primary site) and the lack of post -operat ive residual  tumor at 
the primary site greater  than 1.5 c m2. High-risk disease  is defined  by [CONTACT_470805].  Patients  less than  3 years  of age  are usually  treated  with protocols  
that attempt to avoid  the use of RT due to the high risk of severe

neuropsychological  damage  associated  with its use in these patients with immature 
brains.  
 
Medulloblasto mas are highly  malignant  tumors that are very unlikely  to be cured  by 
[CONTACT_470806][INVESTIGATOR_155456] (CSF) to  distant  leptomeningeal  sites.  The use of post -operative  RT 
can be curative.  The historical  approach  was to use RT without  chemotherap y, with doses 
of [ADDRESS_603238] indicated  that this approach  produces  an approxi mate 5-year event -free 
survival  rate of 60% in  patients  with stand ard-risk disease.  Howeve r, these  doses of RT 
are associated  with a significant  risk of severe  chronic  neuropsychological  and 
neuroendocrine  morbidities,  and growth retardation,  as will  be described  below. These 
proble ms can be ascribed  both to the cranios pi[INVESTIGATOR_470770] a significant 
proportion  of the  boost  dose when convent ional treatment techn iques are utilized.  An 
attempt to reduce  the craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_470771] [ADDRESS_603239] -risk disease  resulted an increased  risk of early 
relapse,  early  isolated  neuraxis  relap se and a strong trend  towards lower  5-year event-free 
survival  (p=0.080).1 
 
Howeve r, in single -arm studies, the addition  of che motherapy  appears  to both improve 
event -free survival  and to allow  the use of  reduced -dose craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_470772]. The Children 's 
Cancer  Group treated  65 children  between  3 and  10 years  of age  with non-metastatic 
medulloblasto ma with reduced -dose crani ospi[INVESTIGATOR_470772] (2340 cGy) and  a boost  to the 
posterior  fossa to  5580 cG y. Patients  also received  weekly  vincristine  during  the RT and 
beginning  6 weeks after  completion  of RT began  a planned  eight cycles  of vincristine, 
cisplatin  and lomustine  chemotherap y. Progression -free survival  was 86% +/ - 4% at  3 
years  and 79% +/ - 7% at  5 years.  Hearing  loss (presu mably due to both cisplatin  and RT 
to the auditory apparatus) occurred in 32%. Neuropsychological  outco me was not 
described.[ADDRESS_603240] regarding the use of even  lower  craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_470773]. 
Investigat ors at the Children 's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470774]  10 children  between  18 and 
60 months of age  with non-metastatic  medulloblasto ma with very reduced -dose 
craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_470772] (1800 cGy) and  a boost  to the posterior  fossa to  5040 to  5580 cG y. 
Patie nts also received  weekly  vincri stine during  the RT and beginning  6 weeks after 
completion  of RT began  a planned  eight cycles  of vincristine,  cisplatin  and lomustine 
chemotherap y. Actuarial  survival  at over 6 years  was 70% +/ - 20%. Of the  3 patients  
whose tu mor recurred, in 1 recurre nce was si multaneously  appreciated  in the primary site 
and distantly  and 2 at distant  sites only. IQ testing  of the  survivors suggested  minimal 
neurocognitive  damage.3

that the patients  that received  the lower dose su ffered less severe  neuropsychological 
toxicity.4 
 
Poor linear  growth and  adult short stature  are extremely common  in survivors of 
medulloblasto ma and result  from a combination  of inadequate  production  of essential 
hormones such as growth hor mone and thyroxine,  and impaired  spi[INVESTIGATOR_470776]. In 
general,  these  abnor malities  are directly  correlated  with the dose of radiation.  Doses  
>3500  cGy to  the hypothala mus result  in growth  hormone deficiency  in 80-100% of 
subjects  within  5 years .5-7 Similar doses ad ministered  to the whole  spi[INVESTIGATOR_470777] a 60% incidence  of pri mary hypothyroidism8 and an estimated loss in  height  in the 
range  of [ADDRESS_603242]  tested  (unpublished  data).  The 3F8 antibody  localizes  to GD2+ tu mors in 
humans,12 mediates  tumor cell lysis in vitro via interactions with human complement and 
leukocytes,  can be conjugated  to 131-I for targeted radioimmunotherap y, and has been 
effective  intravenously  in patien ts with metastatic  neuroblasto ma.13 Intrat hecal 
administration  of radiolabeled  3F8 to  nude rats with GD2+ lepto meningeal  neoplastic 
xenografts  demonstrated  a tumor dose of  1870 cGy /mCi versus only  40 cGy/mCi  using  a 
radiolabeled  control  antibod y. Area  under  the curve  values  in tumor tissue  were  14-fold 
greater  than in blood .14 A trial of intrathecal  131-I-3F8 was perfor med in 8 cyno molgus 
monkeys  at MSKCC.  The therapy was tolerable  and therape utically  relevant  doses of 
radiation  (1900 to  8200 cGy) were  delivered  to the CSF space .[ADDRESS_603243] of a phase  I clinical trial at our instit ution 
(MSKCC 97 -021) in  patients  with GD2+ leptomeningeal  tumors.  Ten patients  (including  
4 with  medulloblasto ma or PNET), aged  [ADDRESS_603244] received 1 to 2 mCi of intrath ecal 131-I-3F8 via 
Ommaya reservoi r, were  imaged to obtain  dosimetr y, and then 7 patients  received  a 
second  dose of 7.8 to  12 mCi .16 
 
Side effects  for the  10 patients  receiving  the dosimetry dose were  all transient and < 
grade  2 including  fever  (n=5),  headache  (n=5),  emesis (n=4),  and leg pain (n=2).  One

convulsant  medications  and progressive  tumor on MRI i maging.  One patient  with pre- 
existing  communicating  hydrocephalus  was treated  with more than one therapeutic 
injection;  sympto ms of raised  intracranial  pressure occurred  after the 4th injection,  and 
required  the place ment of a ventric ulo-periton eal shunt.  No long-term toxicity  has been 
observed  in one patient  surviving  14 months.  
 
Dosimetry to CSF and  marrow  appears  favora ble: the estimated  dose r eceived  to the CSF 
was 14.9 to  56.7 cGy/mCi  (test doses) and  15 to  78.9 cGy/mCi  (therapy  doses), with  little 
intra-patient  variabi lity. Dose to  blood  and other  organs outside  the central  nervous  
system  was <  2 cGy/ mCi. Radioactivity  was detected  in the thecal  sac by [ADDRESS_603246] patients; in the [ADDRESS_603247] clinical  utility  in the treatment of GD2+ 
cancers  with a high-risk of lepto meningeal  disse mination  such as medulloblasto ma. Only 
minimal doses of radiation  are delivered  to the brain  and spi[INVESTIGATOR_470778]  (~1 m m) of the  131-I isotope. This is potentially  advantageous  to 
these  patients since  parenchy mal disease  is rare. 
 
The MSKCC neurosu rgical staff reviewed  the recent institutional  experience  of placing 
Ommaya reservoirs  in patients  for the  treatment of prophylaxis  of lepto meningeal 
metastases.17 Between  January  1995 and  June 1998, O mmaya reservoirs  were  placed  in 
107 patients.  Complications  occurred  in 10 patients  (9.3%) and  included  2 infections,  5 
catheter  malpositio ns, and 3 intracra nial hemorrhages.  Two deaths  occurred secondary  to 
intracranial  hemorrhage,  but both had risk factors  that should  not apply  to our patients. 
One was receiving  anti-coagulation  therapy  for a mechanical  heart  valve and the other 
had thrombocytopenia  secondary  to other  treatment. 
 
Intensity  modulated  radiation  therapy  (IMRT) 
 
IMRT is a new technology  for the  planning  and delivery  of RT. It represents  a significant 
improvement over traditional  3-dimensional  (3D) planning.  IMRT features  sophisticated

computer-optimized intensity  distributions  within  a number of radiation  beams. This is 
achieved  by [CONTACT_470807] -planning  algorithm with dose and  volume constraints  for 
every  target and critical  tissue  in the treatment field.  Penalti es are set for each  constraint 
in order  to set priorities  among the various  volumes. Treatment  is delivered  using 
dynamic multileaf  collimators  (tiny strips  of metal shielding)  whose movements 
throughout  each field during  the treatment are controlled  by a computer. The result  is a 
dramatically  higher  degree of conformality of dose to  the target and significant sparing of 
adjace nt healthy  tissues.  
 
IMRT is currently  available  in only a limited number  of centers.  There  is only [ADDRESS_603248] local 
control,  but follow -up has been  short (4 to  34 months,  median  20 months,  as of 5 -31-02) 
and contin ued surveillance  necessary.

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN  
 
Patients  will receive  3 components  of therap y, as described  below. 
 
9.1 Intrathecal  131-I-3F8 
 
Treatment will be given  via an Ommaya  reservoir  that will be placed  by [CONTACT_470813].  If the  patient  has a  ventriculoperitoneal  shunt,  and CSF flow study 
using  the shunt tubing  has confir med acceptable  CSF flo w, the shunt  may be used for the 
administration  of 131 -I-3F8. 
 
9.1.1  Premedications  for 131 -I-3F8 
 
The following  pre-medication  guidelines  are strongly  suggested,  but may be altered  based 
on the  clinical  judgment of the  investigators  without  being  considered  a protocol  
violation.  
 
To start about 2 weeks  prior to injection:  
 
Levetiracetam  (Keppra):  Start at 10-20 mg/kg divided  BID about  2 weeks prior  to 
injection,  after one week  increase  by 10  mg/kg.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_470785] 250 and  500 mg 
strength  and no liquid  preparat ion is curre ntly available. For patie nts unable to tolerate 
oral tablets,  phenytoin  may be substituted.  Taper of the  anti-convulsant  is recom mended 
(decrease  dose by [CONTACT_2902]  50% [ADDRESS_603253] -injection,  then discontinue  medication  3 days 
later)  rather  than abrupt  discontinuation.  
 
To start about  5 days  prior to injection:

Dose:  A dose of [ADDRESS_603260]  will be treated  to a total dose of 5400 cGy 
(1800 cGy craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]  + 3600 cGy focal).  The whole  brain  dose is  calculated  at 
midplane  while  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_470787].  The IMRT 
boost  will be prescribed  to the isodose line  that includes  at least 95% of the  plannin g 
target volume  (PTV).  
 
Radiation  should  begin  as soon as possible  after the patient  has recovered  from surgery 
and intrathecal  131-I-3F8. Treatment will be given accor ding to standard fractionation  at 
[ADDRESS_603261],  but interruptions  in radiation  therapy  should  be avoided  whenever  possible. 
There  are no minimum blood  count  require ments for radiation  therapy  and radiation 
therapy  may be given  even if chemotherapy  is held. 
 
Treatment volume: Radiation  will be delivered  to the entire  craniospi [INVESTIGATOR_470788] 1 to 2 cm  below  the thecal sack. Care  will be taken  to include  the 
cribriform  plate while  shielding the lenses  of the eyes.  The clinical  target volume (CTV) 
for the  boost  to the posterior  fossa tumor  bed will include  the postoperative  cavity  and any  
residual  disease  plus a 1 cm  margin in all dimensions.  The only exception is that the CTV  
should  not extend  into bones (skull  base,  calvariu m, vertebral  bodies)  and thus the margin 
may be less than  [ADDRESS_603262]  field.  
 
Technique:  Patie nts will receive  craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_470789].  They 
will be simulated in the prone  position  using  immobiliz ation casts  as well as ane sthesia 
when neces sary. A treatment planning  CT scan will be performed and images will be 
fused with  a diagnostic  MRI scan  for better  definition  of anato my. The brain  will be 
treated  with lateral  or lateral  oblique  fields  (depending  upon t he technique  chosen  for lens 
sparin g) matched  to posterior  spi[INVESTIGATOR_470790](s). Appropriate gantry and collimator  angles will 
be calculated to preve nt overlap pi[INVESTIGATOR_470791]. There  will not be a gap betw een the cranial and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_470792] [ADDRESS_603263].  The number of fields  and orientation  of bea ms will be deter mined on an  individual 
basis.  The general  goals  of the  optimization  algorithm  are to maximize coverage  of the 
target volume  (PTV  as defined  above)  while  minimizing heterogeneity  within  the target 
and sparing  the cochlea to the extent  possible. The maximum dose to  any point in the 
brainstem  must not exceed  [ADDRESS_603264] 
not exceed  5000 cGy in  the composite  plan (including  the craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_470793] S loan-Kettering  Cancer  Cent er

mean dose to  each of these struct ures should  not exceed  [ADDRESS_603265]  positioning.  
 
Evaluation  on treat ment: Patients  will be evalu ated by a radiation  oncolo gist at least once 
per week.  Complete blood  counts  will be drawn about  weekl y. 
 
9.3 Chemotherapy  
 
Starting  at about  the onset  of exter nal beam  RT, patients will receive  8 weekly  doses of 
vincristine  (1.5 mg/m2/dose,  maximum 2 mg). 
 
Starting  about  6 weeks after  completion  of the  RT (about  4 weeks after  the 8th dose of 
vincristine  noted above),  we will  start 8 planned cycles  of vincristine, cisplatin, and 
lomustine  chemotherap y. Each  cycle  consi sts of: 
 
Vincristine  (1.5 mg/m2/dose,  maximum 2 mg) IV push on days 0, 7, &  14. 
 
Cisplatin  (75 mg/m2/dose)  IV over about  6 hours on day  0 with  mannitol  and hydration.  A 
sample order  set is included  as an  appendix.  
 
Lomustine (75 mg/m2/dose)  po on day 0. Becau se the capsules  only are availa ble in 10, 
40, and  [ADDRESS_603266] 
possible  dose.  
 
Cycles  are intended  to be repeated  about every  6 weeks depending  on the  ANC and 
platelet  count (see below). The post-RT chemotherapy  may be given  at another  center  if 
more  convenient  for the  patient  as long  as adequate  documentation  is sent to the MSKCC 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a timely fashion.  
 
9.4 Chemotherapy  dose modification  rules:  
 
Hematopoietic  toxicity:  If the ANC is  < 750 or platelet  count  < 75,000, a  cycle  should  not 
be started.  If the  ANC is  ≥ 750, but  < 1000, or the  platelet  count  is ≥ 75,000 but  < 
100,000, the  cycle  may start,  but the lomustine  dose will  be reduced  by 50%.  
 
Neurotoxicity:  For vincristine  neurotoxicity  grade  3 or 4 and/or  for vincristine 
neuropathy:  motor  grade  2 to 4: hold vincristine.  When  toxicity  resolves to less t han 
grade  3 (less than  grade  2 for vincristine  neuropathy:  motor),  vincristine  may be restarted 
at 50% dose (0.75 mg/m2). If the  neurotoxicity  completely  resolves,  increase  to full 
dosage  may be considered.

Page  13  
  
Hepatotoxicity:  If total  bilirubin  is > 1.9 mg/dl, do not  administer  vincristine  dose. If total 
bilirubin  is 1.5 to 1.9 mg/dl, administer  vincristine  at 1 mg/m2 (1.5 mg maximum). 
 
Nephrotoxicity:  If the  creatinine  clearance  or GFR are  > 60 ml/minute/1.73  m2, 
administer  the full dose. If the  creatinine  clearance  or GFR are  30-60 ml/minute/1.73  m2, 
administer  50% of the dose (37.5 mg/ m2). If the creatinine  clearance  or GFR are  < 30 
ml/minute/1.73  m2, do not  administer  cisplatin.  
 
Ototoxi city: For a  decrease in auditory acuity  of (1) ≥ 30 decibels  at 4000 to  8000 Hz or 
(2) ≥ 20 decibels  at 500 to  3000 Hz or (3) gra de 3 ototoxicity  (subje ctive loss correctable 
with hearing aid), a 50% reduction  in cisplatin  dosage will be made. For grade  4 
ototoxicity  (deafness not correctable), cisplatin  will be disco ntinued  unless follow -up 
audiogram  shows an  improve ment in hearing  function.  
 
9.5 Supportive  care guidelines  
 
Clinical  judgment may be used to  alter the following  guidelines  without  being  a protocol 
violation.  
 
Patients  should  receive  PCP prophylaxis.  
 
Filgrastim  (G-CSF) is  allowed  to be used acc ording  to clinical  judgment. 
 
10.0 EVALUATION DUR ING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
A tabular  summary  of the  timing of the  mandated  observations  is included  as an  appendix 
to the protocol.  
 
Dosimetry studies  during  phase  1 of the  protocol  (see section  9.1). 
 
CBC  will be obtained  about weekly  during  external  beam  radiation  therap y. 
 
CBC,  total bilirubin,  AST, creatinine  clearance  or GFR, and  audiogra ms will be obtained 
at baseline  and prior to each cycle  of cisplati n-containing  chemotherap y. 
 
Serum  for anti -idiotype testing  (order as Rese arch test: [ADDRESS_603267].

Acute  toxicities:  Nausea  with or without  emesis is an anticipated  side-effect and may be 
treated  with antiemetic medications.  Fatigue  and a decrease  in all blood  counts  are 
expected.  Patients  generally  have transient complete alopecia and may have permanent

used.  Temporary  xerosto mia and dysphagia  as well as diarrhea  may occur. 
 
Late effects:  The goal of this  study  is to reduce the incidence  and severity  of late  effects 
of radiation  therapy  by [CONTACT_470816]  a

include  neurocognitive  dysfunction,  growth i mpairment, hearing  loss, and  endocrine 
dysfunction  (hypothalamic/pi[INVESTIGATOR_168445] y, thyroid,  and gonadal).  Radiation  dose to  the gonads 
may increase  the risk of infertilit y, especially  in girls. Rare  but severe  late effects  may

12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUT IC RESPONSE/OUT COME ASSESSMENT  
 
The study’s stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37595] (section  14.0) refers  to failures.  Failures  are defined  as 
unequivocal  tumor progression or treat ment-associated  death.  Unequivocal  tumor 
progression may be deter mined via radiological  studies  (head  or spi[INVESTIGATOR_470784]) reviewed  by

given  the relatively  small sample size of 20  patients,  the analysis  of these  scores for 
evidence  of neuroto xicity, or lack  thereof, will primarily be descri ptive. 
 
Should  the results  of this  trial be encouraging,  future  possibilities  would include  use of this 
strategy  on a larger scale  though  the Children 's Oncology  Group, and/or  additional 
institutional  study  of further  decrease  of the  craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_470799], possibly  in conjunction 
with the use of an  increa sed radioimmunotherapy  dose.

nature  of this  tumor type.  Patients  of both  sexes and  all ethnic  backgrounds  are eligible 
for the  study. Particip ation will be voluntary.  Potential benefits include comparable 
event -free survival  with hypothesized  decreased  risk of long -term side effects  
(neuropsychological,  neuroendocrine,  audio metric, growth). Alternati ves include  external 
beam  radiation  therapy  alone  ([ADDRESS_603290])  or 
reduced -dose radiation  therapy  ([ADDRESS_603291]) with  the 
same chemotherapy  that will be prescribed  in this study.  
 
Patients  are responsible  for all  costs of their  care including  (but not limited to) physician 
visits,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],  medications  (exce pt for the  3F8 antibody),  MRI scans, and 
laboratory  work (except  for dosi metry studies).

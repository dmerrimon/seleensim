 SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Title:  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT Trial)  
 
Objectives  
 
Primary Objective:  
Our primary goal is to test the hypothesis that early high dose recombinant human erythropoietin 
(Epo) treatment of preterm infants born between 2 4-0/7 and 27 -6/7 weeks of gestation will 
improve long -term neurodevelopmental outcomes measured at 22-26 months (referred 
throughout the do cument also as “2 year (s)”) corrected age. Specifically, we will determine  
whether Epo decreases the combined outcome of death or neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) 
at 22-26 months corrected age .  
 
Impairment is defined as the presence of any one of the following: cerebral palsy ( CP), Bayley 
Scales of Infant and Toddler Develop ment, 3rd Edition (Bayley -III) Motor Standard Score, 
Language or Cognitive Standard Score  < 70 (severe, 2 SD below mean) or 85 (moderate, 1 SD 
below mean).1, 2 CP will be identified by [CONTACT_66565], 
diplegic CP, hemiplegic CP, or quadriplegic CP. Severity of CP will be determined using the Gross 
Motor Function Classificat ion System (GMFCS) developed by [CONTACT_66566].3, 4 
 
Secondary Objectives  
 To determine whether there are risks to high dose Epo administration in extremely low 
gestational age neonates (ELGANs) by [CONTACT_66567], in a blinded manner, Epo -related safety 
measures comparing infants receiving Epo with those given placebo . As part of this aim, Epo 
pharmacokinetics will be determined.  
 To test whether Epo treatment decreases circulating inflammatory mediators and known 
biomarkers of brain injury over time.  
 To compare brain structure (as measured by [CONTACT_9268]) in Epo treatment and control groups at [ADDRESS_72649] menstrual age ( PMA ).  MRI assessments will include documentation of 
intracranial  hemorrhage ( ICH), white matter injury (WMI) and hydrocephalus ( HC), volume of 
total and deep gray matter, white matter and cerebellum, brain gyrification, inter -hemispheric 
distance, and tract -based spatial statistics (TBSS based on diffusion tensor imaging).  
 As an exploratory aim, we will determine which of the abov e MRI measurements best predict 
neurodevelopment at 22-26 months corrected age.  
 To determine the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in this cohort of extremely low 
gestational age neonates  (REPAIReD ancillary study) .

drug, a cranial ultrasound (CUS) will be obtained to document whether an intracranial hemorrhage 
has occurred prior to dosing  (while the goal will be to obtain the ultrasound prior to study drug 
dosing , a 6 hour grace period will be allowed) . Baseline blood will be drawn to measure Epo 
concentration, inflammatory mediators and biomarkers of brain injury. Subjects will be 
randomized to Epo treatment or placebo  by [CONTACT_66568] (DCC). Each subject will 
be on the study (intervention + time off intervention) until completion of the follow -up visit at 22-
[ADDRESS_72651] will receive Epo 1000 units /kg or placebo IV every 48 ± 2 hours x 6 doses (during 
the first [ADDRESS_72652]).  
 
This will be followed by [CONTACT_66569] 400 units/kg subcutaneously , or sham injection , 
Monday, Wednesday and Friday,  during the period of oligodendrocyte vuln erability (to 32 -6/7 
weeks). Controls will not receive any injections.  Maintenance study drug doses will begin  on the 
day closest to completing the high dose series.  
 
To maintain the blind  in the maintenance portion of the treatment period , control infants will have Figure 1. Study Overview

 an empty  syringe dispensed from pharmacy. Infants assigned to placebo will not  undergo any 
subcutaneous maintenance  injections. All blinded doses will be dispensed in a n opaque  bag with 
tamper resistant tape . Maintenance treatme nts will be administered behind blinds  or curtains . 
After Epo injection or sham injection (no shot), all infants will have a 2” by 2” gauze placed over 
the “injection site” , and this will be covered and wrapped with gauze that is taped to itself, so no 
adhesive touches the child’s skin . 
 
Group 1 (Epo) : 
1. High dose Epo (1000 units/kg) will be administered intravenously every 48 hour s x 6 
doses. Dosing will be based on birth weight.  Study drug may be administered by [CONTACT_66570] a research nurse, giv en that the study drug appears identical.  
 
2. Maintenance Epo (400 units/kg) will be administered by [CONTACT_66571]. Dosing will be adjusted weekly after the subject has regained birth weight. 
A nurse who is not directly involved  with the care of the patient, and who will maintain 
confidentiality will administer all treatments . A cohort of charge nurses, or General Clinical 
Research Center (GCRC) nurses would be ideal for this task.  
 
 Group 2 (Placebo) : 
1. Placebo (saline) will be  given intravenously every [ADDRESS_72653] was receiving active drug.  Study drug  may be administered by [CONTACT_66572] a research nurse, given that the study drug  appears identical.  
    
2. Empty syringes (SHAM doses) will be delivered to infants in the control group however 
they will not undergo subcutaneous injections. Maintenance doses will be administered 
behind blinds  or in a private ro om, and the “injection site” will be covered as described 
above . A nurse who is not directly involved with the care of the patient, and who will 
maintain confidentiality will administer all treatments . A cohort of charge nurses, or 
General Clinical Researc h Center (GCRC) nurses would be ideal for this task.  
 
Exceptional situations:  
 If a dose of study drug is unavoidably delayed or missed, the dose should be given as soon 
as possible. This should be recorded as a study deviation. The normal schedule of 
administration should then be resumed. At least [ADDRESS_72654] separate the high dose study 
drug doses. This allows the plasma Epo concentration to return to baseline.  
 
 If severe edema (anasarca) or other circumstances prohibit the use of subcutaneous 
injection, up to three doses of Epo or saline placebo may be given intravenously  using the 
normal IV protocol . In this case, pharmacy must be notified so they can provide an 
appropriate study drug formulation for IV use (sa line rather than an empty syringe used for 
sham injection) .  This should not be recorded as a deviation  for up to 3 doses.  Subsequent 
IV doses would be considered a deviation.  
 
 If the baby’s IV is removed prior to completing the [ADDRESS_72655] will experience:  
1. Cranial  ultrasound prior to study drug dosing (all subjects)  
2. Intravenous study drug treatment (Epo or placebo) for 6 doses, day 1 -11 (all subjects)

Sample Size and Population  
In order to maintain 752 (376 per arm) who survive and are followed at [ADDRESS_72657] Network reports that 25% of 
ELBW infants are from multiple births a nd a variance inflation factor would therefore involve the 
expected cluster size (1.25) and the within -cluster correlation (ρ) and equal:   1 + (1.25 -1) ρ. If the 
within sib -ship correlation is 0.50 then the variance inflation factor (VIF) would be 1.125 im plying 
a 12.5% (n=94) increase in target sample size necessary to retain appropriate power . Due to 
withdrawal or attrition by 2 years, we anticipate losing 12.5% of the  effective sample size of 752 
and will therefore in crease the overall sample by [CONTACT_66573] 94 subjects for a total enrollment 
target of n=940 subjects.  
 
Qualified infants less than 24 hours of age of both sexes and all races will be entered into the 
study if their parents or legal guardians consent.  
 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_66574], multiple births,  and by [CONTACT_58032]: 24-0/7 to 25 -6/7 
and 26 -0/7 to 27 -6/7. We will use block randomization within site using variable blocks of size 4 , 
6, 8 and 10 subjects. Using block randomization ensures that equal numbers of subjects are 
randomized to the intervention and control arm and that the two groups are balanced at period 
enrollment intervals. For multiple births (twins, triplets) all infants will be randomized into the same 
treatment group (e.g. effective randomization of the mother).

1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objective  
Hypothesis  1. Epo treatment from 24 hours to 32 -6/7 weeks PMA of ELGANs will safely decrease 
the combined outcome of death or NDI from 40% to 30% measured at two years corrected  age.  
 
Objective [ADDRESS_72659] the hypothesis that early high dose recombinant human 
erythropoietin (Epo) treatment of preterm infants born between 24 -0/7 and 27 -6/7 weeks of 
gestation will improve long -term neurodevelopmental outcomes measured at 22-26 month s 
corrected age .  
 
1.2   Secondary Objectives  
Hypothesis 2 . High dose Epo will be safe to administer from birth to 32 -6/7 weeks of gestation in 
this population of ELGANs.  
 
Objective  2. To determine whether there are excess adverse events in Epo treated EL GANs 
compared to control infants. Three time periods will be considered: 1. Safety during the treatment 
period; 2. Safety during the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and 3. Long term outcomes. Timed Epo 
concentrations will be measured to monitor for drug accumulat ion and safety. A Population 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis will be done using these data.  
 
Hypothesis 3 . Therapeutic Epo administration during the period of oligodendrocyte vulnerability 
(24-32 weeks of gestation) will promote normal brain development by [CONTACT_66575] ( BDNF ), decreasing circulating inflammatory mediators, and thereby 
[CONTACT_66576].  
 
Objective  3. To test whether Epo treatment changes sequential measures of BDNF, circulating 
inflammatory medi ators and known biomarkers of brain injury in preterm infants.  
 
Hypothesis 4 . Epo treatment will improve brain development as assessed by [CONTACT_66577] 36 weeks 
PMA.  
 
Objective  4. To compare brain structure (as measured by [CONTACT_9268]) in Epo treatment and control 
groups  at 36 weeks PMA. MRI assessments will include documentation of intracranial  
hemorrhage ( ICH), white matter injury (WMI) and hydrocephalus (HC), volume of total and deep 
gray matter, white matter and cerebellum, brain gyrification, inter -hemispheric distan ce, and tract -
based spatial statistics (TBSS ) based on diffusion tensor imaging. As an exploratory aim, we will 
determine which of the above MRI measurements best predict neurodevelopment (CP, cognitive 
and motor scales) at 22-[ADDRESS_72660] kidney development and incidence of acute kidney injury.

Page [ADDRESS_72661], of 9 ,575 ELGANs born 
between 2003 and 2007 and admitted to the NICU,  death or NDI occurred in 91%, 80%, 66% and 
56% of those born at 24, 25, 26 and 27 weeks gestation, respectively .5 These sobering statistics 
do not include infants that died before admission to a NICU, or those who died within 12 hours of 
admission. Majo r morbidities, which include CP, deafness, blindness, and mental disabilities , are 
present in 50% of surviving  extremely preterm infants at school age.6-[ADDRESS_72662] chosen to study ELGANs born between 24 -0/7 and 27 -6/7 weeks of  
gestation because of their high likelihood of poor outcome, and the absence of therapeutic 
interventions to improve outcome. Because these infants are at such high risk of death or 
impairment, a strategy of prophylactic intervention is reasonable as there  is great potential for 
benefit.25, 26   
 
Restrictions:  Babies born at 23 -0/7 to 23 -6/[ADDRESS_72663] estimates of death rates are 74%, and 
unimpaired survival rates are 1%.5, 19 More mature babies are also excluded because their risk of 
poor outcomes is lower, thus prophyla ctic use of an unproven therapy is not indicated.  
 
Intervention Regimen . Study infants in the Epo group will receive 6 IV doses of 1000 U/kg during 
the first [ADDRESS_72664]. This will be followed by 
[CONTACT_66578] 400 U/kg SC 3 times  per week during the period of oligodendrocyte 
vulnerability (to 32 -6/7 wks).  
 
Dose Justification.  The Epo dose, and 
duration of therapy chosen for this study is 
based upon available preclinical and 
clinical data for Epo neuroprotection.27 In 
rodent and ovine models of neonatal brain 
injury, Epo doses of 1000 -5000 U/kg/dose 
result  in sustained neuroprotection, 
improving both short and long -term 
structure and function.28-31 Higher doses 
are needed for neuroprotection due to the 
low percentage of circulating Epo that 
crosses the blood brain barrier.32 
 
Although doses as high as 3000 U/kg/dose 
are being tested in preterm infants without 
apparent adverse effects,[ADDRESS_72665] ion has a U -shaped dosing curve, with too little or too much Epo Figure 2. Epo concentrations in human preterms

 resulting in diminished efficacy.29, 34 In rats, repeated doses of 1000 -5000 U/kg show optimal 
neuroprotection. To estimate how neuroprotective Epo doses in rat pups relate to human 
pharmacokinetics, plasma Epo c oncentrations were measured in extremely low birth weight 
infants ( < 1000 g birth weight) after 500, 1000, and 2500 U/kg/dose.35 Nonlinear kinetics were 
noted, consistent with previous studies in neonates.36 In these infants, IV administration of 500 
and 1000 U/kg resulted in similar peak concentrations but faster clearance than were achieved in 
rat pups after 5000 U/kg (Figure 2).  Table 2 shows a comparison of pharmacokinetic indices in 
neonatal rats and humans. Doses of 1000 U/kg Epo resulted in area under the curve (AUC) 
measurements most similar to the most protective dose in rats.29 The 500 U/kg dose fell short 
(one third to one quarter the protective AUC), while 2500 U/kg was close to three times the optimal 
dose in rats. Mi nimum steady -state concentrations (mean = 576 mU/ml) were produced using the 
1000 U/kg/dose.

What constitutes clinical significance?  Clinically significant studies are those that improve 
clinical practice and patient outcomes. Changes to clinical practice can occur slowly or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_66496] a number of factors: importance of the results, the size of the studies, risk of the 
therapy, and endorsement of medical associations such  as the AAP. Ibrahim  et al.  performed a

new therapy in infants <  [ADDRESS_72666] examples of changes in clinical 
practice based on published trials. Prenatal steroids reduce the risk of death or morbidity in

largely centered in academic or medical centers and they attend several meetings each year 
where new information about treatment can be presented. The PENUT trial results will be 
presented at reg ional Pediatric Research Society meetings such as the Western and Eastern 
Society for Pediatric Research, and at national and international meetings including the Pediatric 
Academic Societies combined meetings, the European Society for Pediatric Research m eeting, 
the American Academy of Pediatrics meetings, and at other venues such as “Hot Topi[INVESTIGATOR_66498]” . 
 
Clinical Impact.  Mortality of extremely preterm infants has decreased,42, 43 but morbidity in 
survivors remains high due in part to increased survival of sicker infants. There remains an 
enormous burden of both medical and neurodevelopmental impairment in these children. Using 
the birth statistics for the US in 2009, we anticipate the magnitude of Epo treatment to translate 
as follows: with Epo treatment, the annual burden  of death or severe NDI will decrease from 40% 
(12,226 babies) to 30% (9,170 babies, primary outcome), and that death plus moderate or severe 
NDI will decrease from 60% (18,340 babies) to 40% (12,226 babies, secondary outcome). We 
anticipate this change wi ll derive primarily from improved neurodevelopmental outcomes. If Epo 
is proven to safely reduce combined morbidity and mortality of ELGANs, we anticipate a shift in 
neonatology practice that would improve the lives of babies and their families, and decrea se the 
cost of healthcare.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_72671] vulnerability,57 ELGANs remain at risk for brain 
injury throughout the period of oligodendrocyte development.  
 
Epo Neuroprotection . Epo has anti -inflammatory, anti -excitotoxic,58 anti-oxidant,59 and anti -
apoptotic effects on neurons and oligodendrocytes, and promotes neurogenesis and 
angiogenesis, which are essential for injury repair and normal neurodevelopment. Epo effects are 
dose -dependent, and multiple doses are more effective than single dos es.28, 29, 60 Epo reduces 
neuronal loss and learning impairment following brain injury,61, 62 and even when initiated as late 
as 48 -72 hours after injury, there is evidence of improved behavioral outcomes, enhanced 
neurogenesis, increased axonal s prouting, and reduced WMI.63, 64  
 
Protective effects.  Perinatal inflammation (chorioamnionitis, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), or 
sepsis) is associated with increased risk of NDI.13, 65, 66 Microglial activation67 and increased 
cytokine expression, particularly TNF -, interleukin (IL) -6, and IL -8, have been associated with 
brain injury in preterm infants68, 69 and in animal models of neonatal brain i njury.70 Epo has 
demonstrated anti -inflammatory effects, which may contribut e to neuroprotection in the scenario 
of preterm birth and increased inflammatory activity.71-77  
 
White matter injury.  WMI is a common brain injury affecting preterm infants.48, 52, 55 Epo

Translational trials of neonatal Epo neuroprotection are in progress.  Epo improved 
neurodevelopmental outcomes in two trials of term neonates with hypoxic -ischemic brain 
injury.111, 112 Retrospective studies of cohorts of preterm infants that received Epo for 
erythropoiesis compared to controls show improved outcomes.113-115 Two preliminary reports of 
preterm infants treated prospectively also show benefit:  
 
1) Preterm infants 500 to 1250 g treated with Epo (400 U/kg 3x/week) from birth to 35 weeks PMA 
had an average cumulative cognitive score 10 points higher than placebo/controls (98±14 Epo 
vs. 88±14 for controls).  Epo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_66499];116   
 
2) A phase III trial is ongoing in Switzerland to test the safety and neuroprotective efficacy of 3000 
U/kg/dose x [ADDRESS_72676] 3 days after birth to neonates (<1500 g, < 32 weeks PMA). 
This group has p resented preliminary data in abstract form on 100 infants showing that such 
dosing is safe, and that the Epo -treated group showed less WMI by [CONTACT_9268];84  
 
3) Follow -up of the infants studied in our phase I/II trial35 shows that Epo treatment correlated with 
improvement of cognitive (R= .22, p < 0.05) and motor (R = .15, p < 0.05) scores.117

is the holder of the IND. The trial has been registered with clinicaltrials.gov and has been assigned 
Identifier Number [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  
 
3. STUDY DESIGN  
 
Study Overview.  This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study of Epo 
neuroprotection in an ELGAN population. Figure 1 provides an overview of the study . 940 patients 
will be enrolled at 16 -18 sites across the country in order to evaluate 752 at 22-26 months  
corrected age . Enrollment and initial treatment with study drug will occur by 24 hours after birth. 
Subjects will be randomized to either Epo treatme nt or placebo , and treatment will continue until 
32-6/[ADDRESS_72678] will be made at 4 month intervals. Data will be collected on 
interval medical history and functional status. Face to face follow -up will occur at two years 
corrected age, at which time standardized neurodevelopmental assessm ents will be made. The 
primary outcome is death or severe NDI at 22-26 months corrected age, with a secondary 
outcome of death, severe or moderate NDI.  
 
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF SUBJECTS  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 NICU Inpatients between 24 -0/7 and 27-6/7 weeks of gestation  
 24 hours of age or less  
 Arterial or venous access  
 Parental consent  
 
When calculating gestational age, the following hierarchy will be used in order of accuracy:  
1.  Gestational age by [CONTACT_66582]  
2.  Gestational age by [CONTACT_66583] (0 to 14 -0/7 weeks)  
3.  Gestational age by [CONTACT_66584] (up to 28 -0/7 weeks)  
4.  Last menstrual period (LMP)  
5.  Newborn maturational assessment  
 
We estimate, based on the ELGAN study, that 62% of subjects will hav e the most accurate dating 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page 13 of 75 PENUT Protocol  V6.1 October 14, 2019  
 based on #1 or #2, that 29% will have dating based on second trimester fetal ultrasound, 7% by 
[CONTACT_66585], and only 1% by [CONTACT_66586].  
 
Postnatal age will be calculated based on time and date of birth.  
 
Arterial  or venous access is considered to be a functioning peripheral intravenous catheter, a 
peripherally inserted central catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]), an umbilical venous (UVC) or arterial catheter 
(UAC). One of these catheters must be available for the administration of s tudy drug. It is 
preferable that the patient also have a catheter suitable for phlebotomy, although that is not an 
absolute entry criterion for the study.  
 
To be admitted into this study, the legal guardian of the patient must give written informed consent . 
Each site will obtain IRB approval for the study, and will have IRB approved consent forms 
available in English and a second language of their choosing . A translator will be provided for 
non-English  speaking individuals as needed.  If a translator is not available, the family will not be 
approached.  
 
4.2     Exclusion Criteria  
• Known m ajor life -threatening anomalies ( e.g. fetal diagnosis of brain, cardiac,  or renal 
malformations  
• Known or suspected  chromosomal anomalies  
• Severe hemato logic crises such as clinically evident disseminated intravascular 
coagulopathy , twin -twin transfusion such that 1 twin is not eligible  due to polycythemia or 
hydrops  
• Polycythemia (hematocrit >  65%)  
• Hydrops fetalis  
• Known c ongenital infection  such as toxopl asmosis, CMV, rubella or syphilis.   
• Prior administration  of erythropoietin  to the baby  
• Infant is likely to die due to severity of illness or withdrawal of support is being considered 
prior to enrollment  
 
As part of standard care of an extremely preterm inf ant, a CBC will be obtained within the first [ADDRESS_72679] is >  65%, the patient will not be eligible for the study. If the PLT count is 
< 50K, or if there are clinical signs of bleeding, a coagulation panel will be checked to determine 
whet her there are signs of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. If this condition exists, the 
patient is not eligible for the study.  
 
All patients eligible for this study will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66500] (NICU). 
Many concurrent ill nesses are expected for this population of extremely preterm infants. These 
include, but are not limited to: ICH, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), hydrocephalus (HC), 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), hypotension, pa tent 
ductus arteriosus (PDA), NEC, early and late onset sepsis, and retinopathy of prematurity  (ROP). 
None of these will exclude a child from study entry, but all will be considered in the safety 
evaluation of Epo.   
 
4.3 Enrollment Procedures.  
 
4.3.1 Screening . Admissions to the antepartum unit and to the NICU at each site will be screened 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page [ADDRESS_72680] opportunities for reflecti on and questions.  
 
4.3.2  A site screening log  will be maintained to document patients screened, reasons for 
ineligibility, and reasons for nonparticipation of eligible subjects. This document will be maintained 
by [CONTACT_66587] : 
screening number, screening date, patient surname , medical record number, date of birth,  
gender, eligibility (yes/no), whether they were enrolled, and if not enrolled, the reason why. If a 
subject is enroll ed, document that consent was obtained, and the study ID number.  
 
In addition, selected site screening information will be entered electronically and maint ained in 
the PENUT Portal data management system. Entered data will not contain patient names or 
medi cal record numbers. This cumulative log will be reviewed at regular interval s to determine 
enrollment and reasons for non -enrollment.  This information will be used to consider whether 
other recruitment methods should be used.   
 
4.3.3 Consent procedures.  Antenatal consent will be obtained when possible. The study 
investigator will obtain permission from the Maternal Fetal Medicine Attending to approach the 
mother to discuss the study. If consent is obtained prenatally, this will be re -confirmed at the tim e 
of the child’s birth  if required by [CONTACT_1036] . Postnatally, permission to approach the family will 
be obtained from the Attending Neonatologist. The Attending health care provider will seek 
parental agreement for an investigator to meet and discuss t he study. If the parents are interested, 
the study investigator will discuss the study with family and seek consent in person. The 
consenting legal guardian will receive a copy of the consent form to review, and once signed, will 
be given a copy to keep. I deally,  if the Attending physician is also a study investigator, an alternate 
study investigator , or their designee , should  obtain consent, so as to avoid the appearance of 
coercion. If this is not required by [CONTACT_47798], an investigator who is also the Attending physician  
may obtain consent. Investigators will only approach family after infant’s attending heath care 
provider gives permission and family indicates that they are interested in further information about 
the study. No alteration in care will o therwise occur. The a ttending neonatologist and family can 
withdraw child from study at any time.  If permissible by [CONTACT_47798], phone consent may be 
obtained, but must be reaffirmed with the family when they are present. Investigator should retain 
origin al signed document.  The investigator will obtain c onsent in a room which ensures the privacy 
of the family, and which is free of potential coercive influences. Consent for participation must be 
obtained before  the baby [CONTACT_832] [ADDRESS_72681] a 
large population of non -English speakers, consent forms will be translated into the appropriate 
languages. If an in terpreter is not available in a timely manner, the family will not be approached.  
 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page [ADDRESS_72682] will be randomized to one of two groups after 
establishing eligibility and obtaining signed consent for study participation and HIPAA compliance. 
Interventions/Treatments will be as outlined in Table 4. Study drug will be administered according 
to the schedule shown in Figure 3. 
 
Cranial Ultrasound.  After written consent is obtained, but before administration of study drug, a 
cranial ultrasound will be done to document whether an intracranial hemorrhage has occurred. 
Results of this examination will not affect clinical care, eligibility, or randomiza tion for the study, 
but will be used as part of the safety analysis. [CONTACT_66672] , a UW radiologist who will be 
blinded to the treatment groups and any clinical information about the child , will read the cranial 
ultrasound s. If a cranial ultrasound is  indicated based on the patient's condition, it will be ordered 
by [CONTACT_66588].  For more details 
please see the Cranial Ultrasound guidelines, Appendix 6.  
 
Phlebotomy:  Subjects will have four timed blood samples drawn during the first two weeks of life  
(see Figure 3). The first blood draw may be obtained from cord blood, if available. At the two year 
follow -up visit, an additional (optional ) blood sample of 0.5 mL will be drawn.  Figure 3.

Cerebral S pi[INVESTIGATOR_17106] (CSF) : If a clinically -indicated spi[INVESTIGATOR_66501] 
(e.g. to  rule out meningitis ), then residual CSF may be available for the PENUT study to collect.  
In that event, w e request 0.15 mL CSF be collected and frozen  for measurement of  CSF Epo 
concentration in any infant who undergoes a diagnostic lumbar puncture during the initial 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . If residual CSF is available for the PENUT study, then a small  systemic blood 
sample (0.15 mL) will ideally  also be collected within one hour  of when the CSF sample is 
collected  and processed to plasma  as described above. These biologic specimens will be sent to 
the UW CCC lab for analysis. Diagnostic spi[INVESTIGATOR_66502] a serendipi[INVESTIGATOR_66503] E po/cytokine levels with CSF levels.  If significantly elevated Epo 
concentrations are present, further analysis, either by [CONTACT_66589] . If no blood can be obtained, CSF  should still be 
collected and sent to the CCC . 
 
Brain MRI:  A subset of 220 subjects will undergo a brain MRI at 36 weeks PMA. Prior to scanning, 
infants will be fed and swaddled. If needed, the patient can be immobilized using a MedVac Infant 
Vacuum Immobilization Bag (contou r Fabricators, Inc., Fenton, Michigan), or comparable device  
as per usual site practices for neonatal MRI scans .119 Per usual site practice , ear plugs, and /or 
ear covers [MiniMuffs® (Natus Medical Inc., San Carlos CA)] will provide noise reduction. Exams 
will be rescheduled if the child cannot be quieted sufficiently for the exam. Subjects will be 
monitored with an MRI -compatible pulse oximeter. A caregiver tra ined in MRI procedures and 
neonatal resuscitation will be in attendance.

Epo Risks : In adults, complications of prolonged Epo treatment include polycythemia, s eizures, 
hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, tumor progression, and 
shortened time to death.  
 
None of these adverse effects have been reported in Epo -treated neonates. No prospective 
studies of neonatal Epo treatment hav e reported group differences in the incidence of neonatal 
morbidities, including ICH, ROP, NEC, BPD, or late onset sepsis,120 but a Cochrane review 
reported  an increased risk of ROP with early treatment.121 This report was recently revised, with 
no statistical increase in ROP noted for early or late Epo administration.122 One retrospective 
report also described an increase in cutaneous hemangiomas in Epo -treated preterm infants.123  
 
In the 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_66504] , one  at the University 
of Washington Medical Center and  one in Switzerland, no increased risk of any complications 
were noted in a total of 60 treated patients, including ROP.33, 35 In the UW  study, we observed 5 
cases of severe ROP in 23 surviving controls compared to 6 of 24 Epo treated infants.35

 Safety data from a  prospective  randomized controlled phase II trial of high dose Epo in 
Switzerland ( ClinicalTrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), in which 3000 U/kg daily was given to infants  26-
0/7 to 31-6/7 weeks of gestation at 3, 12 -18 and 36 -42 hours after birth (N=229 treated, 214 
controls) has been reassuring.  There were no relevant differences between the groups for short -
term outcomes including mortality, ROP , IVH, sepsis, NEC , and BPD.[ADDRESS_72685] been published rev iewing the safety and efficacy of Epo 
for erythropoietic purposes ,122, 127, 128 and another meta -analysis focused specifically on Epo and 
ROP.129 Conclusions from these reviews are as  follows: Epo , whether used early or late,  reduces 
the use of one or more RBC transfusion s, and the number of RBC transfusions per infant. No 
increase in any of the complications of prematurity are noted, i.e. use of erythropoietic doses of 
Epo are safe in  preterm infants. The safety of higher, neuroprotective doses has not yet been 
systematically evaluated in large population studies.  
 
Epo is a potent erythropoietic growth factor. Thus, high doses of Epo given for neuroprotective 
treatment might be expected to increase erythropoiesis, and possibly megakaryocytopoiesis. In 
neonatal rats, there is a transient increase in hematocrit following high -dose Epo,[ADDRESS_72686] rage of 14%, reflecting phlebotomy losses in 
these sick infants.[ADDRESS_72687], currently the primary indication for Epo use in neonates. 
Dosing of 400 U/kg/dose three times a week has been shown to decrease (but not eliminate) 
need for blood transfusions .131 
 
1) Safety during the high dose treatment period.  Serio us adverse events (SAEs) specific to 
Epo will be defined as any of the following during the treatment period:  
• Hypertension : subject required prolonged antihypertensive therapy (> 1 month) and/or will 
be discharged on medication  
 Polycythemia (central hemat ocrit > 65%, or hematocrit increase ≥ 15% not due to red blood 
cell transfusion)  
 Major venous or arterial thrombosis (involving a major vessel not related to an infusion line , 
requiring anticoagulation, or symptomatic such as causing superior vena cava syndrome ) 
 
Serious adverse events most likely related to prematurity will include  
 Severe pulmonary hemorrhage  (severe, e .g., need for increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], positive 
pressure. Not pi[INVESTIGATOR_66505]).  
 Necrotizing enterocolitis ( stage 2B or 3)  
 Severe sepsis : Blood c ulture -proven bacterial or fungal sepsis requiring blood pressure 
support or significant new respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413].  
 Intracranial hemorrhage (grade III or IV)  
 ROP requiring intervention (surgery or Avastin) . 
 
ROP  will be included as a severe adverse event, although due to the timing of screening, which 
begins at [ADDRESS_72688] likely be too late to discontinue treatment. Each case of ROP will 
be reviewed in real time. Subjects will be screened for ROP as pe r the 20 06 guidelines: for  24-[ADDRESS_72689] screening will occur at 31 weeks PMA.132 The timing of follow -up 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page 19 of 75 PENUT Protocol  V6.1 October 14, 2019  
 ROP exams will be determin ed by [CONTACT_66590].  
 
Resolution of SAEs : 
 NEC  
-When infant is able to take full feeds, or what is considered equivalent to full feeding for 
that particular infant.  If the child does not make it to full feedings due to short gut, note 
the method of feeding at the time of discharge (e.g. Home TPN)  
 
 ROP 
-When an infant is diagnosed by [CONTACT_66591]  
-They no longer require frequent follow up ophthalmology appointments   
 
 IVH 
-When shunt placement has occurred.  
-When sequential cranial ultrasounds show the ventricle size is stable or  getting smaller.  
 
 Hypertension  
-When hypertensive medications are discontinued  
-If infant is discharged on antihypertensive medications   
 
 Sepsis  
-When antibiotics are completed.  
 
 Thrombosis  
-When anti coagulation treatment ends . 
 
 Pulmonary Hemorrhage  
-When no more blood in tracheal secretions and with stable vent settings . 
 
Additional serious events which may be expected or unexpected include:  
 Death  
 Cardiac arrest  
 Other unexpected life threatening event

 The following flow diagram will be used to determine how to label an adverse event.  
Criteria for Temporarily Withholding/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_66506]/or Supplemental Iron.  
1. Polycythemia:  Central hematocrit (Hct) > 65%: Study drug  should be held until Hct is < 55%. 
2. Severe sepsis : Blood c ulture -proven bacterial or fungal sepsis requiring blood pressure 
support or significant new respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]. Supplemental iron  should be held until blood 
culture is negative for  72 hours.  Rationale:  Iron has been reported to be permissive for 
selected  gram -negative bacteria and might worsen the patient's condition during sepsis. 
There is no known relationship between Epo and sepsi s, so study drug does not need to 
be held.  
 3. Unexplained recurrent seizure  (unrelated to ICH, PVL or other known pathology): Study 
drug should be held until seizures are well controlled by [CONTACT_12617]. Restarting study drug 
will be determined by [CONTACT_1689], DSMB, and CCC.  
4. Major venous or arterial thrombosis (clot).  
a. Study drug  should b e held for a ny thrombosis that is treated with a course of 
anticoagulation . 
b. Study drug  should be held for a ny symptomatic  thrombosis involving a major vessel 
(e.g. symptoms such as superior vena cava syndrome)

 5. Sustained hypertension  requiring medical intervention : Study drug  should be 
discontinued if blood pressure requires treatment.  When blood pressure returns to normal 
range (systolic blood pressure < 100 mmH g), study drug can be resumed. This is true even 
if patient is still being treated, but blo od pressure is being controlled.   
 
In the event that study drug is discontinued in any subject, sites will encourage parents to 
continue to allow their child to participate in the follow -up evaluations.  
 
2) Safety during the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Due t o the inherent vulnerability of this patient 
population, the rate of comorbidity is high , particularly in the most immature infants . The most 
current week -specific data for large populations of similar infants are provided by [CONTACT_66592] (9575 infants of extremely low GA (22 –28 weeks),5 and by [CONTACT_66593] (1506 infants 23 -27 weeks).43, 133-[ADDRESS_72690] definitions of respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086] (RDS), BPD, ICH, PVL, early -onset and late -onset sepsis, NEC, patent ductus

criteria for temporarily w ithholding/ stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_66507]/or supplemental iron.   
 
3) Long term outcomes.  During  the phone interview s that will occur at 4, 8, 12, 18 , 30, 36, 42, 
48, 54, 60  months , and at the face-to-face 2 year (22-26 months ) corrected age  visit, data will be 
obtained regarding interval hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], medication use, resource utilization, medical 
diagnoses, and oxygen requirement. At 12 months, parents will also be queried about their child’s 
development .  At two years corre cted age, weight, blood pressure, and n eurodevelopmental 
outcomes will be documented (neurologic exam, Bayley III scores, and M-CHAT -R evaluation) . 
Urine and blood will also be collected at this time.  
 
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  
Procrit will be utilized for this study ( manufactured by [CONTACT_11337], distributed by [CONTACT_66595]) . 
 
Study Drug Procurement by [CONTACT_66596], preservative free vials of PROCRIT, Epoetin alfa, 2000 Units/mL (NDC [ZIP_CODE] -302-
01) for use on this study.  An inventory of drug will be purchased speci fically for this study. The 
invoices for the purchase of the Procrit will be retained at the site in the same manner that a study 
drug shippi[INVESTIGATOR_66508].  A copy of the invoice and the drug accountability logs 
must be submitted for reimbur sement  at approximately six month intervals by [CONTACT_966].  
Because of the blinded nature of the PENUT Trial, the pharmacy must send this information 
directly to the CCC financial coordinator .  The study investigator(s) and coordinator(s) cannot 
review this information.   
 
Single -dose, Preservative -free Vial : Each 1 mL of solution contains 2000 Units of Epoetin alfa, 
2.5 mg Albumin (human), 5.8 mg sodium citrate, 5.8 mg sodium chloride, and 0.06 mg citric acid 
in Water for Injection, USP (pH 6.9 ± 0.3). This formulation contains no preservative.  
 
Preservative free normal s aline will be used as placebo for the first 6 doses, and will be provided 
by [CONTACT_63696].

Blinding/Drug Administration.  
After enrollment , the DCC will provide randomization information to t he site pharmacy. The site 
pharmacy will then dispense study drug in a closed container. Epo and placebo (saline) are the 
same in appearance, and will be labeled “study drug”. The first [ADDRESS_72692] to completing the high do se 
series. To maintain the blind , pharmacy will dispense “PENUT STUDY drug” in a syringe to all 
infants. Control infants will not  undergo any maintenance  injections. A nurse who is not directly 
involved with the care of the patient, and who will maintain confidentiality will administer 
treatments behind curtains or blinds . A cohort of charge nurses, or General Clinical Research 
Center ( GCRC ) nurses would b e ideal for this task. After injection or sham injection, all infants 
will have the injection site covered by a 2 x 2 gauze and wrapped with a gauze bandage, which  
is secured by [CONTACT_66597][INVESTIGATOR_66509] .  The time, date, and study drug intervention will be docu mented 
for each drug administration event.  
 
Exceptional situations:  
 If a dose of study drug is unavoidably delayed or missed, the dose should be given as soon 
as possible. This should be recorded as a study deviation. The normal schedule of 
administration should then be resumed. At least [ADDRESS_72693] separate the high dose study 
drug doses. This allows the plasma Epo concentration to return to baseline.  
 
 If severe edema (anasarca) or other circumstances prohibit the use of subcutaneous 
injection, up to three doses of Epo or saline placebo may be given intravenously  using the 
normal IV protocol . In this case, pharmacy must be notified so they can provide an 
appropriate study drug formulation for IV use (saline rather than an empty syringe used for 
sham injection) .  This should not be recorded as a deviation  for up to 3 doses.  Subsequent 
IV doses would be considered a deviation.  
 
 If the baby’s IV is removed prior to completing the 6 intravenous study drug doses, the dose 
can be administered subcutane ously.   This should be recorded as a study deviation.  
 
The risks of intravenous administration of medication include infiltration, infection, and possibl e 
bleeding. The risks of subcutaneous injections include bruising, pain at the site of injection, and 
infection.  
 
Iron supplementation:  Iron supplements (oral and intravenous preparations) will be obtained  
from each site pharmacy as per their usual practice.  
 
Iron Treatment Plan . Please see Appendix [ADDRESS_72694] milk is 
unavailable. Once infants (all subjects) have an enteral intake of 60 mL/kg/d  and are at least one 
week old , they will be started on enteral iron at a dose of 3 mg/kg/d total. Enteral iron will be 
increased to 6 mg/kg/d when infants achieve an enteral intake of 100  to 120  mL/kg/d.137 This is a 
well-tolerated dose that helps to prevent iron deficiency in preterm infants.137 Serum ferritin or 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)

 ZnPP/H ratios should be checked at [ADDRESS_72695] the iron dose and recheck ferritin 
(or ZnPP /H) at 28 days (see figure). If subjects are not able to tolerate enteral feedings and oral 
iron supplements, they will be given maintenance iron parenterally as noted in Appendix 7.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We estimate that less than 20% of babies will receive one parenteral dose of iron, since feeding s 
are most often started by [CONTACT_4475] 2 or 3, and advanced by 10 to 20 mL/kg/day. More than two 
parenteral doses will be rare. If the child is NPO for a prolonge d period, parenteral iron dosing 
should be adjusted based on serum ferritin or ZnPP/H.  
 
5.3 Concomitant Interventions  
Infants < 27 -6/7 weeks of gestation require treatment for associated problems of prematurity. 
Interventions include, but are not limited to, mechanical ventilation, sedation, treatment of 
seizures, treatment of PDA either medically or surgically, treatment of sepsis (bacterial or fungal), 
transfusions with packed red blood cells or platelets, treatment of NEC either medically or 
surgically,  and assessment and treatment for ROP. Preterm infants are also at risk for acute 
kidney injury and late hypertension. Data will be collected on associated conditions and 
medications used to treat them during the course of the subject enrollment.  
 
5.3.1  R equired Interventions . 1) Epo/ placebo  treatment as designated by [CONTACT_17628]; 2) 
cranial  ultrasound within 6 hours of (preferably prior  to) first study drug dose; 3) iron 
supplementation; 4) blood drawing 2. 5 mL for Epo and biomarkers plus up to 1.2 mL f or iron 
studies; 11 urine samples obtained at baseline and study days  3-5, 7-9, 14 ±1 day , then during 
weeks 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, and at the 2 year follow -up; 5) MRI at 36 weeks PMA depending on 
study site; neurodevelopmental follow -up at 22-26 months corrected age  at all study sites.  With 
parental permission, ongoing follow -up will be obtained by [CONTACT_1555] 6 -month intervals.

Cranial  ultrasound s at baseline, 7 -10 days and at 36 weeks PMA  (30 days of age or later is acceptable) will be 
sent to UW CCC,  as will all brain MRI s. Analysis will be done using the most severe lesion noted.

window for initiation of study intervention from birth is 24 hours.  
 
6.3.2  On -Study/On -Intervent ion Evaluations  
After consent is obtained, a cranial ultrasound must be obtained prior to , or within [ADDRESS_72703] 6 doses of intravenous study drug, and at discharge. 
Complete blood count s (CBC) drawn as part of clinical care will be recorded, as will laboratory evaluations of 
renal and hepatic function.  
 
Blood draws:  Blood draws are timed according to Study drug dosing (see Figure 3).  All subjects will have 5 
blood draws (0.5 mL volume each) as  part of this study . This blood will be used to determine plasma  Epo 
concentrations, biom arkers of brain injury, and the effect of Epo on systemic inflammatory response. The cell 
pellets will be frozen and saved for future studies that are beyond the scope of this study.  A final (optional ) blood 
draw will be obtained at the 2 -year follow -up visit.  This blood will be evaluated for renal function for the purposes 
of identifying markers of kidney injury at follow -up. 
 
Collection Schedule  
1. Day 0: Baseline - prior to first study drug dose  (may use cord blood)  
2. Day 7: 30 min after the 4th study drug dose (peak)  
3. Day 9: 30 min prior to the 5th study drug dose (trough)  
4. Day 14  ± 1 day : Denote the time of draw on sample  relative to drug dosing  
5. 22-26 months corrected age  
 
Blood draws will be synchronized with the clinically needed blood samples when possible. Epo measurements 
will be done in all subjects, and cytokine measurements (Aim 3) will be done in the subset of 2 20 subjects (1 10 
per arm)  who will also be undergoing a n MRI at 36 weeks PMA .  
 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page 28 of 75 PENUT Protocol  V6.1 October 14, 2019  
 Following serum ferritin (0.4 mL) or ZnPP/H (0.1 mL) to assess iron status is strongly recommended  beginning 
at 14 days. If these lab values are outside the normal range, it is recommended that iron supplementation be 
adjusted, and  repeat labs (ferritin or ZnPP/H)  be followed more closely (at 2 -week intervals). This would increase 
the total blood volume drawn for study purposes by 0. 2 (if ZnPP/H is assessed) to 0.8 additional mL of blood (if 
ferritin is assessed). These volumes (Maximum of 2.8 mL) are within the IRB recommendations for infants of this 
weight: “Existing guidelines for blood sample volume limits (ranging from 1 –5% of total blood volume within 24 
hours  and up to 10% of total blood volume over 8  weeks) are consistent with the limited evidence available on 
“minimal risk” to children”.138 Given that the blood volume of premature infants ranges from 80 to 85 mL/kg, their 
total blood volume would range from 40 mL (80 x 0.5 Kg) to 85 mL (85 x 1  Kg). The maximum amount of blood 
to be drawn for study purposes is 2  + 0.8 mL = 2.8 mL, which is  within the guidelines.  
 
Blood draw precautions:  If there is a venous or arterial catheter in place appropriate for blood drawing, this will 
be used preferentially. If no access is available, standard neonatal phlebotomy techniques will be used.  
 
Urine co llections  
Rationale: Little is known about acute kidney injury (AKI) in extremely preterm infants. S erum creatinine (SCr) 
and urine output are not ideal markers to define AKI, especially in neonates. Even in adults, the increase in SCr 
is known to be a rel atively late occurrence. The use of SCr in neonates is complicated by [CONTACT_66600], it reflects maternal SCr.  
 
Urine biomarkers of cell injury/repair are felt to have great potential. However, before these novel biomarkers 
can be used clinically, we must evaluate their ability to predict a SCr rise, as well as short and long -term clinical 
outcomes. The goal of collecting detailed information about renal function in these infants is ultimately to improve 
the ability to diagnose  AKI, and to better understand the epi[INVESTIGATOR_66511] . BUN and creatinine are commonly checked as part of routine care of extreme 
preterm infants. When obtained for clinical indications, these values will be recorded.  
 
Neonatal AKI has been classically defined by [CONTACT_66601]/anuria and/or a persistent SCr elevation. We will use 
categorical definitions to make the diagnosis of AKI, similar to definitions published by [CONTACT_41134] (2012) 
http://www.kdigo.org  and the AKIN groups (2007). Jetton , et al., proposed a modification of the adult Acute 
Kidney Injury Network Criteria (AKIN) definition of AKI as a standardized definition of AKI for neonates based on 
a rise in SCr from a previously documented low, rather than on an absolute SCr threshold.  
 
Stage 0 : No change or rise <  0.3 mg/d L 
Stage 1:  Increase in SCr 0.3  mg/dL or a SCr 150 –200% from previous trough value  
Stage 2 : Increase in SCr 201–300% from previous trough value  
Stage 3:  Increase  in SCr > 300% from previous trough value or 2.5  mg/dL or need for  dialysis  
 
Urine will be obtained at timed intervals as shown in Figure 4. With the exception of the initial urine, which will 
be collected at the time of enrollment, if the date of urine collection falls on a Saturday or Sunday , the urine will 
be collecte d on the closest weekday.  Do not delay study drug dosing if no urine is available at enrollment, but 
still obtain first urine available.  Urine samples are requested at the time of enrollment, on day 3 to 5, day 7 to 9, 
with a preference for day 7 if that  is possible, day 14  ± [ADDRESS_72704] urines, and do this consistently. This is to minimize the work for the 
site coordinator as much as possible.

The u rine samples will be banked for future analyses of biomarkers (neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin 
(NGAL), KIM -1, osteopontin (OPN), cystatin C (CysC), uromodulin (UMOD), epi[INVESTIGATOR_66512] (EGF) and 
urine β2 -Microglobulin (β2MG).   There are increasing data in older children as to the validity  of such markers for 
diagnosis of AKI, but very little data in preterm neonates.   Additionally, prior to including these markers as part 
of the neonatal AKI definition, more knowledge is needed on other clinical factors which may affect urinary 
concentrati ons of these biomarkers independent of renal function (e.g. inflammation, NEC or other neonatal 
specific conditions).   Advantages to eventually including novel renal injury biomarkers in a future definition of 
neonatal AKI are that they would ideally repre sent actual renal tubular injury versus the solely functional markers 
of AKI currently used.  
 
Urine will be collected by [CONTACT_66602]’s diaper with a diaper change.  (If needed, a bag can 
be used to collect urine instead of cotton bal ls.)  At the next diaper change, these cotton balls will be placed in 
an empty 10 mL syringe and the plunger will be used to squeeze the urine out into collection tubes.  The collection 
tubes will be labeled with the infant’s study ID number, and date. The  urine will then be frozen and sent in batches 
to the University of Washington for further processing and analysis.

The review titled: “Practice parameter: neuroimaging of the neonate: report of the Quality Standards 
Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology 
Society” published in [ADDRESS_72705] recommendations for the timing and grading of ultrasound finings.139 Cranial 
ultrasounds are recommended at day 7 -10 and at 36 -0/7 to 36 -6/7 weeks PMA or prior to discharge  if this occurs 
earlier.   Our study guidelines are modified from these recommendations in that an additional research crani al 
ultrasound will be done on day 1 , prior to (or within 6 hours of) the first study drug administration.  While our 
guidelines request a late cranial ultrasound or MRI be done at 36 weeks PMA, we will accept a CUS done after 
30 days of age.   
 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging.   Please see Appendix 2 for pulse sequences.  
MRI’s will be obtained on 110 subjects from each study arm at 36 weeks PMA (220 total). All scans will be done 
on a 3T  Siemens  or 3T Philips  scanner using an optimized protocol determined by [CONTACT_3433] e Imaging committee. These 
scanners are available at the University of [LOCATION_012]  in Gainesville, [LOCATION_012] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66513],

 Automated Developi[INVESTIGATOR_66516]:  Analyses will be based on automated processing steps 
developed specifically for analysis of early developi[INVESTIGATOR_66517], as part of separate on -going R01 projects 
on fetal and  premature neonatal brain image analysis, directed by [CONTACT_66603] , PhD  (R01 NS 061957 and 
R01 NS 055064). Validated automated techniques will segment gray matter, myelinated, and un -myelinated 
white matter using 3D T1W MRI data. These make use of age -specific spatial statistical priors synthesized from 
a computational spatio -temporal atlas140, [ADDRESS_72706] for an automated expectation maximization base d labeling scheme, illustrated in 
Figure 5.  
 
Following tissue segmentation, anatomical regions will be automatically labeled (Figure 6) using fine scale 
unbiased spatial normalization to form an unbiased minimum deformation group average anatomy.  
 
Spatial Normalization for population based analyses . Accurate spatial normalization of developi[INVESTIGATOR_66518] -based mappi[INVESTIGATOR_66519]. For structural image analysis we will us e

in tissue contrast such as blood clots that may be present in some anatomies and potentially induce incorrect 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_66521].  
 
Evaluation of Global and Regional Tissue Growth (GRTG) summary measures . We will first use the 
automated tissue segmentations to evaluate summary measures for global and regional growth rates in each 
subject for conventional statistical analyses. Gray matter, myelinated white matter and un myelinated white matter 
will be estimated by [CONTACT_66604] a set of pre -defined Figure 5. Preliminary results using a specialized template driven expectation maximization (EM) scheme

 brain regions. Each MRI will be automatically labeled with an optimized patch -based brain labeling technique142 
based on a subset of manually delineated MRI scans that are aligned to form a statistical model of the labeling. 
The labeling approach combines multi -atlas based methods with patch -based techniques t o optimally assign 
region labels to each new individual MRI scan. The resulting label maps combined with tissue segmentations 
provide summary measures that can be analyzed using linear modeling described in more detail by [CONTACT_15791].  
 
Evaluation of patterns o f tissue growth using Tensor -Based Morphometry (TBM) of Structural MRI.  We 
will use TBM to look for spatially localized biomarkers of abnormal brain tissue growth across the population 
using techniques developed and validated in fetal brain imaging.44 The local volume changes induced by [CONTACT_66605][INVESTIGATOR_66523]. These will be evaluated from the Jaco bian determinant of the deformation at each voxel.143 We will 
apply general linear modeling to analyze these maps to account for age and other covariates together with main 
outcome measures on a voxel -by-voxel level, generating regre ssion coefficients and associated t -statistics at 
every voxel in the average anatomies by [CONTACT_66606][INVESTIGATOR_007].144 Correction for multiple comparisons will 
be achieved using an efficient parallel implementation of non -parametric permutation testing.145 This analysis 
permits a spatial hypothesis free exploration of how local tissue growth rates are related to outcome and 
treatment variables across the study populati on.  
 
Evaluation of Cortical Folding using Surface Curvature Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (SCM) . We will use the automated 
segmentations of cortical tissue boundaries to evaluate the local and global state of neonatal brain folding to 
look for perturbations in cortical develop ment, using techniques our group has previously used in both fetuses 
and premature neonates.146, [ADDRESS_72707]’s surface folding map will be transformed 
into the unbiased population average anatomy using the deformations described above for TBM analysis. These 
are mapped onto a common tessellated average surface146 to allow statistical p arametric mappi[INVESTIGATOR_66524] a vertex -
by-vertex general linear model. As with TBM, this generates a map of regression coefficients and t -statistics 
(here on a surface of vertex locations), which is corrected using an efficient parallel implementation of non -
parametric permutation testing,145 again permitting a spatial, hypothesis -free exploration of how local and global 
cortical foldin g is related to outcome and treatment variables acros s the study population. Figure 6  shows an 
example of changes in surface folding over time in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103].  
 
MRI Analysis.  All MRI images will be sent to UW CCC for analysis, where they will be will be converted to 
DICOM format and stored on the DICOM server.   Todd Richards , MD  will write customized software to prepare 
data for analysis at the UW CCC site such as reformatting, resorting, and extraction of diffusion b -values  b-
vectors for tensor calculations. He has already written b -values, b -vector extraction code for the Philips Acheiva 
scanners but will need to customize code for the Siemens scanners. Standardized phantoms ( The Phantom 
Laboratory, Incorporated ) will be used at each site to est ablish data  integrity for quality control of MR data.  
 
Qualitative image analysis  will be performed by [CONTACT_66607]’s care team. For study purposes, each MRI will be  evaluated by [CONTACT_6283]. 
Dennis Shaw and Manjiri Dighe,  who will be blinded to the treatment group, and all clinical data. Qualitative 
evaluation will be done using the recently published MR Imaging Assessment Tool created by [CONTACT_66608].149 This scoring system defines 
abnormalities of white matter, gray matter, and includes measures of hemorrhage, and brain  loss. The table 
below is excerpted from this manuscript.

Quantitative analysis.  We will use a range of highly sensitive automated techniques to quantitatively assess 
brain development at 36 weeks PMA using MRI analysis tools developed as part of on-going projects in the 
biomedical image computing group at UW ( http://depts.washington.edu/bicg ) led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Studholme. We will 
examine global and regional summary measures of tissue volume,[ADDRESS_72708] scan to examine whether the state of overall br ain growth at 36 weeks 
PMA has been modified by [CONTACT_66609]. We will then explore the possible presence of focal 
differences in growth patterns that may be related to specific functional deficits. This will use group  wise spatial 
normalizatio n to examine the spatial pattern of tissue volume increase,44 and water diffusion, together with 
patterns of cortical surface folding.146 
 
DTI Analysis:  The met hodology detailed below is currently used by [CONTACT_66610]’s Diagnostic Imaging Sciences Center (DISC).  
 
Preprocessing . DTI quantification will be preceded by [CONTACT_66611] a reference volume151 with FDT (FMRIB’s Diffusion Toolbox; 
http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ fsl/fdt/index.html). Using the field maps, B 0-field inhomogeneity induced geometric 
distortion in the eddy current -corrected  images will be corrected with PRELUDE (phase Region Expanding 
Labeller  for Unwrappi[INVESTIGATOR_66525])152 and F UGUE  (FMRIB's Utility for Geometrically Unwarpi[INVESTIGATOR_66526];  
http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/fsl/fugue/ ).  FSL software DTIFIT  will be used to fit the 
diffusion tensor model at each voxel in  order to calculate DTI Eigen vectors, Eigen values, fractional anisotropy, 
axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity ( http://www.fmrib.ox .ac.uk/fsl/fdt/fdt_dtifit.html ). 
 
Development of 36 Week Infant Head Model for MRI. We will use software (MINC) 
developed at the Montreal Neurological Institute 
(http:/ /www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/MINC ) in order to co -register and 
combine [ADDRESS_72709]. Patricia Kuhl where 
he used MINC to make a head model for 6 month old infant brain using 43 brains.  
 
Evaluation of white matter integrity using DTI.  Group differences in fractional 
anisotropy (FA), axial diffusi vity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity (similar to ADC) 
will be determined using TBSS (Tract -Based Spatial Statistics).153 TBSS was

Page [ADDRESS_72710] method detailed in the TBSS instruction manual 
(http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/tbss/ index.html ). We plan to use Randomise, a permutation method, to test for 
between -group differences in these DTI measures. Correction for multiple comparisons will be done using whole 
brain cluster -based thresholding method:  voxel height, p < 0.01; cluster  extent, p < 0.05. Our group is well 
published in this area of diffusion imaging, DTI and DTI analysis.154-157 Statistical comparison for TBSS will be 
performed using FSL -software called Randomise ( http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/randomise/index.html ). This 
program will be used to perform a non -parametric voxel by [CONTACT_66612] (and correlations with clinical score) 
with multiple comparison correction using the Threshold -Free Clus ter Enhancement option. Randomise is a 
permutation program enabling modeling and inference using standard General Linear Model design matrix setup 
using cluster -based tests. For more detail on permutation testing in neuroimaging see Nichols and Holmes.[ADDRESS_72711] whether Epo treatment decreases serial measures of circulating inflammatory 
mediators and biomarkers of brain injury.  
 
Circulating Proteins :  
We will use Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology to measure the following inflammatory markers and growth 
factors: BDNF, Interferon -gamma (IFN -γ),82 Interleukin (IL) -1 β,158 IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF -
α), transforming growth factor ( TGF)-β, matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP )-2 and MMP -9,159 macrophage 
inflammatory protein -1α (MIP-1α), MIP -1β136, monocyte chemotactic protein -1 (MCP -1)136  and tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase ( TIMP )-1.159 
 
Markers of neurotoxici ty and brain injury will include: S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuron 
specific enolase (NSE), Activin A, and Ubiquitin C -terminal hydrolase -L1 (UCH -L1).160-[ADDRESS_72712] been evaluated as potential biomarkers of brain injury. Promising 
biomarkers include the GFAP, Ubiquitin C -terminal hydrolase -L1 (UCH -L1), myelin basic protein (MBP), S100B, 
Activin A, and neuron -specific enolase (NSE), although the sensitivity, specificity and timing of elevation after 
injury in preterm infants have yet to be determined. All of these proteins, with varying levels of specificity, are 
elevated after brain injury in studies of  adult or neonates. Due to the immaturity of myelination, MBP is unlikely 
to be useful in preterm infants.  
 
GFAP is a specific marker of differentiated astrocytes and increased circulating concentrations are detectable 
within hours and peak at up to four d ays after an ischemic stroke.160-163 Astrocyte foot processes make up the 
sub-endothelial component of the blood -brain barrier (BBB), so elevations of GFAP can also reflect loss of BBB 
integrity. UCHL1 expression is highly specific to neurons and t o cells of the neuroendocrine system. Elevations 
have been demonstrated in term infants with HIE. S100B belongs to a family of calcium handling proteins and is 
localized predominately in glial cells in brain. It is thought to function in neurite extension,  inhibition of PKC -
mediated phosphorylation, axonal proliferation, and inhibition of microtubule assembly. NSE is a glycolytic 
enzyme localized primarily to neurons. However NSE is also expressed in platelets and erythrocytes, so 
elevations may not be spec ific to brain injury. GFAP has not been studied in the context of preterm brain injury, 
but a direct comparison of GFAP, S100B, and NSE showed that GFAP was a superior biomarker of brain injury 
in the setting of traumatic brain injury.164

Activin  A is a member of the transforming growth factor -β superfamily and is expressed by [CONTACT_66613]. It is a trophic 
factor that regulates differentiation and proliferation of neurons.165  In a cohort of 53 infants, Florio , et al., showed 
that high concentrations of Activin A (>  0.8 mcg/L) in blood samples drawn during their first hour of life was highly 
correlated with ICH in preterm infants <  32weeks gestation (100% sensitivity and 93% specificity, with positive 
predictive value of 79%).166, 167 Activin A is also increased in term newborns with mo derate or severe asphyxia 
suggesting that activin is released after neuronal injury.168 
 
Population Epo Pharmacokinetic Analysis.  We will measure timed Epo concentrations to monitor for 
accumulation and safety, and to confirm Epo dosing. Plasma  Epo concentrations will be measured in duplicate 
using Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology  at the UW Laboratory Core . Batched samples will be run every 
12-18 months. A population pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using sparse plasma  Epo c oncentration 
data. NONMEM software (Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD) will be used to determine 
compartmental population pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., clearance and volume). The base structural model 
will be implemented as established in t he population pharmacokinetic model developed from the intensive 
pharmacokinetic data of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].[ADDRESS_72713] ors (e.g. gestational age, birth weight, 
serum creatinine, concomitant medications) on pharmacokinetic parameters. Based on the final population 
model, post -hoc Bayesian individual pharmacokinetic parameters will then be estimated for each participant. 
Pharmacodynamic relationships will be determined between Epo pharmacokinetics and the clinical and 
biochemical markers measured during the investigation.  
 
Blood (0.5  mL/sample, 2. 5 mL total) will be obtained through an indwelling umbilical arterial or venous catheter 
when possible. Samples will be spun for 10 min at 1000 g; plasma  and cellular components will be frozen in 
separate labeled tubes at -70°C  to -80°C. Samples will be labeled with a code provided by [CONTACT_66614]. All samples will be sent to [CONTACT_66671]’s lab at the University of Washington. Each site will be sent premade 
packages containing the instructions, data sheets, sample labels, blood collection tubes and mailing labels with 
which to process the blood samples  (See Laboratory SOP) .  
 
Neurodevelopmental Follow -Up: High-risk follow -up for ELGANs is part of standard care at all sites. Routine 
visits generally occur at 4 months, 8 months, 12 months, 18 months and two years corrected age . The timing of 
visits may vary depending on the child’s need for intervention  and site -specific protocols . If subjects are not 
scheduled at any one of these time points for routine high risk follow -up, parents/guardians will be contact[CONTACT_66615] 4, 8, 12, [ADDRESS_72714]’s medical problems, medications, use of services such as physical therapy . The 
timing of these call can be found in  Table 5  and Appendix 3 , “Follow -up manual,”  for further detai ls.   
 
The primary outcome will be neurodevelopment at 22-26 months corrected age . All personnel involved in the 
neurode velopmental assessme nts will be blind to study treatment. Assessment at 22-26 months corrected age 
will include:  
 
 Bayley III Scales of Infant and Toddler Development  
 Standardized neurological examination based on ELGAN Neurological Exam Study protocol (Appendix 
3) 
 The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)  
 Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers ( M-CHAT -R) (Appendix 3) 
 
Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) is the standard test used to evaluate early neurodevelopmental 
outcomes of preterm infants.13, 19, 169, 170 The second edition Bayley Scales, used from 1969 to 2005, was 
mode stly predictive of cognitive function at school age with MDI < 70 showing a positive predictive value of 0.19

 – 0.8 for identification of children with an IQ < [ADDRESS_72715] 
was revised in 2005176, 177 (Bayley III Scales of Infant Development): the Mental Development index (MDI) 
reported in the Bayley II was a composite  of co gnitive, expressive and receptive language; in the revised Bayley 
III, individual scores for cognitive, expressive and receptive language are reported in addition to an assessment 
of social -emotional, and adaptive behavior. As experience has accumulated, i t has become apparent that 
children score higher on the Bayley III compared to the Bayley II.1, 177-[ADDRESS_72716] identified two important stepped outcomes: the primary outcome is very stringent, 
and uses a cut off of [ADDRESS_72717] deviations below the mean for cognitive or motor scales (<  70). The secondary 
outcome uses a cut off of one standar d deviation below the mean for these criteria (<  85), which will still have a 
significant impact on the child, family, and healthcare system.  
 
Inter -Rater Reliability Training:  
Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition . Individuals  performing  the BSID -III assessments  
for this study  will be required  to be certified after attending  a formal Training  & Orientati on Workshop  6 months  
before  testing  as organiz ed by [CONTACT_6283].  Michael O’Shea and Jean Lowe (run in tandem  with a neurological  trainin g 
session).  The certification process is comprised of two parts. First, each candidate Infant Assessor will review 
the test publisher’s “Enhanced Administration DVD,” which will be employed in this RCT as the “gold standard” 
for administration and scoring of the Bayley III. Second , the candidate Infant Assessor will administer the Bayley 
to healthy full -term infants who are 24  month s old. Video -recordings will be made of these administrations. The 
candidate Assessor will score each of his/her pi[INVESTIGATOR_66527]. A copy of the candidate’s test protocol will 
be sent to the Study Psychologist (Jean Lowe, PhD) at the coordinating center, along with a copy of the video 
recording. The Study Psychologist will use these materials to assess the candidate’s ability  to (a) engage the 
infant in the Bayley activities, (b) administer and score each Bayley item, and (c) compi[INVESTIGATOR_66528]. 
Infant Assessors will be required to meet the calibration standard for certification:  88% score concordance on 
items correctly administered. The Study Psychologist will provide prompt item -specific feedback, so that the 
candidate can make any needed modifications. Once Infant Assessors have begun to see enrolled patients, we 
will ask each A ssessor to record one Bayley administration after the first [ADDRESS_72718] 
“calibration drift” over time. Training for Bayley assessment staff will include a semi -annual ass essment to ens ure 
continued reliable and valid assess ment data. For non-English  speaking infants, we will use an interpreter who 
interprets each of the Assessor’s  requests to the child.  
 
Neurological  exam . To standardize the quality of data regarding neurological exams, examiners will attend a 
one-day workshop at [ADDRESS_72719] responses. Annotated feedback will be given to examiners regarding items that 
had a less than  85% correct rate, and, based on experience in the ELGAN study, we expect agreement rate to 
rise to over 90%.43, 184 To minimize expectation bias, examiners will be blinded to the child’s medical history and 
brain -imaging studies. Findings from the neurological exam will serve as the basis for an algorithm that classifies 
infants into one of four groups: no CP, diparetic CP, hemiparetic CP, and quadriparetic CP.185 These 
categorizations correlate highly with long -term neurodevelopmental outcomes. We will use the neurologic exam 
forms created for the NINDS -funded ELGAN study (Appendix 3). In addition, CP severity will be determined 
using the Gross Mot or Function Classification System (GMFCS) developed by [CONTACT_66566].3, 4, 186, 187 A GMFCS 
score of 2 or greater will be considered severe CP, given that these children will not be able to walk independently 
at age 2.  
 
 
b) Standardized Diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy and Quantification of Motor Delay  
The presence and sub -type of CP will be determined using the broadly accepted and standardized ELGAN 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page [ADDRESS_72720]. Karl Kuban provides a distributable method of neurologic 
testing of subjects in a formalized, systemized method th at is highly reproducible.184 CP severity will be 
determined using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS).4, 186, 187 
 
Rationale for d iagnosing sub -types of CP:  
Although all forms of CP will be tabulated as part of the primary outcome, relationships between CP sub -types 
and cognitive development vary by [CONTACT_66616] -categories:  
- Spastic Quadriparesis: has a higher association with structural injury and quadriparetic children are [ADDRESS_72721] MDI < 70 and a high rate of positive M-CHAT -R scores vs. 
diparetic and children without CP.  
 
- Spastic Hemiparesis: represent an intermediate level of injury where 53% of this form of CP have Bayley < 70 
vs. 75% for quadriparesis and only 34% for  diparesis; consistent with a more common association with unilateral 
injury and focal lesions like middle cerebral artery stroke, that spare fibers closest to the ventricle in control of 
lower extremities.  
 
- Spastic Diparesis: Diparesis is more commonly associated with symmetrical white matter injury close to the 
ventricle presumable due to injury of leg fibers of the pyramidal system that are closest to ventricles.  
 
Gross Motor Function Classification System: The Gross Motor Function Classification Syst em (GMFCS) 
system developed by [CONTACT_66566], et al. focuses on children's functional achievements rather than on their 
limitations. It places emphasis on the child’s routine performance (not necessarily their best capacity) in the 
home or community setting.  
 
The GMFCS system uses descriptions defining [ADDRESS_72722] ordinal scale where 
the distance between levels is not considered equal. Distinctions between levels are based on the need for 
assistive technology including mobility d evices (such as walkers and wheeled mobility), and to a much lesser 
extent the quality of movements. Levels between 3 and 5 (the highest possible score) indicate progressively 
more serious limitations of gross motor function and that child is severely hand icapped.3 Table 6 shows the 
classification relevant to our study population.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page [ADDRESS_72723] for Autism in Toddlers ( M-CHAT -R). Parent questionnaire  (Appendix 3) will be administered 
to the mother/caretaker at the 2 year corrected age follow -up visit. This instrument is validated for s creening 
toddlers between 16 and 30 months of age, to assess risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  
 
“The primary goal of the M-CHAT -R was to maximize sensitivity, meaning to detect as many cases of ASD as 
possible. Therefore, there is a high false pos itive rate, meaning that not all children who score at risk for ASD 
will be diagnosed with ASD. To address this, we have developed a structured follow -up interview for use in 
conjunction with the M-CHAT -R; it is available at www.firstsigns.org .” Users should be aware that even with the 
follow -up questions, a significant number of the children who fail the M-CHAT -R will not be diagnosed with an 
ASD; however, these children are at risk for other developmental disorder s or delays, and therefore, evaluation 
is warranted for any child who fails the screening.  
 
The M-CHAT -R can be scored in less than two minutes. We will use the scoring template available at 
www.firstsigns.org . Children who fail more than 3 items total or 2 critical items (particularly if these scores remain 
elevated after the follow -up interview) will be referred for diagnostic evaluation by a specialist trained to evaluate 
ASD in very young children.  
 
As the fiel d of Neonatology has matured, more nuanced follow -up of NICU graduates has become available. It 
is now clear that preterm babies have a higher risk than do term infants for psychological and behavioral 
problems, with autism spectrum disorders and attention  deficit problems identified specifically.189-[ADDRESS_72724] better preserved brain structure, and 
therefore, functi on.

Page [ADDRESS_72725] to increase the likelihood of follow -up participation will include 
sending birthday cards and appointment reminders. Follow -up rates of > 90% have been achieved in most of 
our study sites, using these metho ds. An offset for parents' travel/work loss expenses ($100) will be provided at 
the completion of the face -to-face follow -up visit at 2 years corrected age.  An additional $100 per visit is included 
in the budget to provide for unusually high travel expense s when needed. We estimate this will be needed for 
15% of subjects.  
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_72726] is removed from study treatment for any reason (parent decision, Attending physician choice, or 
because of SAE such as a symptomatic clot requiring anticoagulation), the reason for discontinuation will be 
recorded. Since this is an intention -to-treat study design, any subjects who discontinue intervention will continue 
to be followed and evaluated on study. Like all study su bjects, these families will have a discharge questionnaire 
filled out, and will be contact[CONTACT_10073] 4, 8, [ADDRESS_72727] travel over 2.5 hours for the follow -up visit, overnight accommodations may be 
offered.   
 
6.3.5  On Study/Off -Intervention Evaluations  
The MRI should be done between 36 -0/7 and 36 -6/[ADDRESS_72728] to  32-6/[ADDRESS_72729] be maintained in the site investigator’s study 
files.  
 
IRB approved informed consent form  - All IRB approvals and correspondence (including approved revisions, 
protocol, advertisements, etc.) - Copi[INVESTIGATOR_4800] (excluding any budgetary 
matters) - Copi[INVESTIGATOR_66529] - Copy of all safety reports.  
 
The UW DCC co -supports an installation of REDCap, software specifically designed for electronic data capture 
that we have use d successfully in other multi -site studies. REDCap features include differentiated user roles and 
privileges, password and user authentication security, electronic signatures, SSL encryption, and comprehensive 
auditing to record and monitor access and data  changes ( http://www.project -redcap.org/software.php ). REDCap 
will serve as the architectural backbone for all data captured prospectively, with all data linked by [CONTACT_66617]. 
 
Record Retention.  The clinical site is responsible for maintaining all records (i.e., case report forms, original 
data, screening logs, signed informed consent forms, correspondence, etc.) until notified, in writing, by [CONTACT_66618], that these records are no longe r needed. The Investigator must notify  the UW CCC lead study coordinator  
if the site or records are relocated, if the investigator leaves the institution, etc. , and a new address for the records 
must be provided.  
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_72730] has completed the 2 year corrected age follow -up visit, there are no further requirements for 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page 39 of 75 PENUT Protocol  V6.1 October 14, 2019  
 study participation. Participation in any further follow -up will require new consent.  If consent is given, phone 
follow -up will continue at 6 month intervals  up to a maximum age of 5 years. At that point, we hope to enroll 
willing participants in a follow -up study that will follow the children up to 8 years of age.  
 
6.4   Special Instructions and Definitions of Evaluations  
Screen admissions to antepartum and N ICU: Screening for eligible subjects will be done daily. For antepartum 
admissions, this will involve determining whether any admissions within the past [ADDRESS_72731] will be asked whether this patient might be an appropriate study candidate, 
and if so, whether it is permissible to approach the mother to discuss the study.  
 
For neonat al admissions to the NICU, screening will involve determining the infant’s time of birth and gestational 
age. If they qualify for the study, the Attending Neonatologist will be asked whether they meet inclusion (but not 
exclusion) criteria. If the baby [CONTACT_66619], the Attending will be asked whether it is permissible to approach 
the family to discuss the study. Once it is confirmed that the family is willing to hear about the study, they will be 
approached for informed consent.  
 
A screening log will be completed for all screened patients.  
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_72732]. The Attending physician will seek parental 
agreement for an investigator to meet and discuss the study. If the parents are interested, the study investigato r 
will discuss the study with family and seek consent in person. The consenting legal guardian will receive a copy 
of the consent form to review, and once signed, will be given a copy to keep. Ideally, if the Attending physician 
is also a study investigato r, an alternate study investigator , or their designee , should obtain consent, so as to 
avoid the appearance of coercion. If this is not required by [CONTACT_47798], an investigator who is also the Attending 
physician  may obtain consent. Investigators will only approach family after infant’s attending heath care provider 
gives permission and family indicates that they are interested in further information about the study. No alteration 
in care will otherwise occur. The attending neonatologist and family can withdraw child from study at any time. If 
permissible by [CONTACT_47798], phone consent may be obtained, but must be reaffirmed with the family when they 
are present. Investigator should retain original signed document.  Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_37888] 
a room which ensures the privacy of the family, and which is free of potential coercive influences. Consent for 
participation must be obtained before the baby [CONTACT_832] [ADDRESS_72733] a large population of non -English speakers, consent 
forms will be translated into the appropriate languages. If an interpreter is not available in a timely manner, the 
family will not be approached.  
 
The parents of the research participants will be given opportunity to review the study both verbally and in writing. 
The will be given opportunity to ask questions of the investigator prior to giving consent.  
 
If there are changes in the protocol or safety information that require consent forms to be updated, they will be 
sent through the IRB process for approval. When entering a patient into the PENUT Portal electronic database, 
documentation of a signed consent form as well as a signed HIPAA form  is required prior to randomization .  
 
A model informed  consent form is included as Appendix 1.   
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page 40 of 75 PENUT Protocol  V6.1 October 14, 2019  
  
6.4.2  Documentation of Gestational Age  will be done according to the following hierarchy, and the method by 
[CONTACT_66620]:  
1. Gestational age by [CONTACT_66621].  
2. Gestational age by [CONTACT_66583] (0 -14-0/7 weeks)  
3. Gestational age by [CONTACT_66584] (up to 28 -0/7 weeks)  
4. Last menstrual period (LMP)  
5. Newborn maturational assessment  
 
Documentation of intracranial  hemorrhage.  Screening Cranial  Ultrasounds will be obtained as per the 
guidelines . Only the first ultrasound is done for study purposes. The subsequent two ultrasounds (or MRI at 36 
weeks) will be done as part of routine clinical care. The Imaging  Guidelines delineate how pathology will be 
documented and graded.  
 
Documentation of clinical findings during the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66530] [ADDRESS_72734] is in the NICU will be documented.  
 
6.4.6  Study Intervention Modifications . Study drug  and/or iron supplementation  will be held or stopped for 
the followi ng criteria:  
 Polycythemia:  Central hematocrit (Hct) > 65%: Study drug  should be held until Hct is < 55%. 
 Severe sepsis : Blood c ulture -proven bacterial or fungal sepsis requiring blood pressure support or new 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]. Supplemental parenteral iron should be held until blood culture is negative for 72 hours.  
Rationale:  Iron has been reported to be permissive for selected gram -negative  bacteria and might worsen 
the patient's condition during sepsis. There is no known relationship between Epo and sepsis , so study 
drug does not need to be held.  
 Unexplained recurrent seizure s (unrelated to ICH, PVL or other known pathology): Study drug  should be 
held until seizures are well controlled by [CONTACT_12617]. Restarting study drug will be determined by [CONTACT_66622], DSMB, and CCC.  
 Major venous or arterial thrombosis (clot).  
 Study drug  should be held for any thrombosis that is treated with anticoagulation, and this should be reported 
to the CCC  PI [INVESTIGATOR_66531].  
 Study drug  should be held for any symptomatic  thrombosis involving a major vessel (e.g. symptoms such 
as superior vena cava syndrome)  
 Sustained hypertension  requiring medical intervention: Study drug  should be discontinued if blood 
pressure requires treatment.   When blood pressure returns to normal r ange (systolic blood pressure < 100 
mmHg ), study drug can be resumed. This is true even if patient is still being treated, but blood pressure is 
being controlled.    
 If the subject requires prolonged antihypertensive therapy (> 1 month) and/or will be disch arged on 
medication this is considered an SAE. Medications used to treat hypertension will be recorded.   Any work 
up done to investigate causes of hypertension will be recorded.

6.4.7  Clinical Assessments.  
Clinical safety parameters  
1) Complete physical exam  will be done on study entry, after the fir st 6 doses of study drug (day 12 -15) and at 
discharge. Growth parameters (head circumference, height and weight) will be obtained at these times. The 
presence of microcephaly (OFC  < 10th percentile) o r relative microcephaly (discrepancy of > 50 percentile 
between weight, length and head circumference) will be recorded.  
 
2) Vital signs and blood pressure . All ELGANs are monitored continuously for heart rate and arterial saturation 
(pulse  oximetry), with  either continuous or intermittent blood pressure readings as part of routine care in the 
NICU. The high and low blood pressure will be recorded for the first 14 days of the study, and then  BP 
measurements will be recorded at 6 set time points through disc harge.   
 
3) Hematologic data . Complete blood count (CBC) including hematocrit, white blood cell count, absolute 
neutrophil count, platelet counts and blood smear are obtained routinely in extremely preterm neonates as part 
of their care. This is done to e valuate for infection, and to evaluate  the need for transfusion  (ELGANs receive an 
average of [ADDRESS_72735] month of life) . Results of these tests will be recorded weekly, as 
available , through 36 -6/7 weeks PMA  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] . The number and volume of blood transfusions, 
donor exposures, and phlebotomized blood volume will be recorded for the entire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. Ferritin or 
ZnPP/H  will be followed to monitor iron status. While important for all preterm newborns, this is strongly  
recommended for infants receiving parenteral iron. Iron supplementation will be modified based on these results 
(See  Appendix 7 I ron Guidelines) . 
 
4) Renal  function.  Daily weights, and fluid intake and output will be recorded as available  in the chart. BUN and 
creatinine  will be recorded as available  in the chart. If renal ultrasounds are done for clinical indications, the 
results from these studies will be recorded. Ten urine samples will be collected non -invasively at timed intervals 
from the time of e nrollment until discharge.  
 
5) Liver function . Conjugated b ilirubin will be recorded weekly as available , through 36 -6/7 weeks PMA. These 
data are checked routinely on all infants requiring parenteral nutrition support, and as part of routine assessment 
of nutritional status.   
 
6) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_42541] . Respi[INVESTIGATOR_66532], including respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086], pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumothorax, pneumonia, duration of mechanical ventilation (> 1 day, > 1 
week), and oxygen use at 28 days and BPD at 36 weeks PMA.  
 
7) Complications of extreme prematurity  defined as follows will be recorded:  
 Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD will be defined at 36 ± 1 week s corrected gestational age. Infants 
requiring nasal cannula o xygen, CPAP/high flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation will be considered 
mild, moderate or severe BPD, respectively.   
 
 Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC). Bell's staging criteria will be used to define NEC. All surgeries for NEC, 
and for strictures or  bowel obstructions occurring as sequelae of NEC, will be recorded.  NEC stage II or III 
is considered an SAE.  
 
 Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). All infants will be followed using the screening recommendations 
published in 2006.202 The international classification of ROP will be used.203 Severe ROP requiring 
intervention is considered an SAE  
 
 Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) , white matter injury (WMI) or hydrocephalus (HC). A cranial  ultrasoun d will 
be done prior to the first study drug dose as part of the study. Brain imaging will also be done as part of 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page 42 of 75 PENUT Protocol  V6.1 October 14, 2019  
 routine care at 7 -10 days and 36 weeks PMA  (30 days of age or later  is accept able). The presence, location 
and extent of any intracranial ble eding, hydrocephalus or periventricular echolucencies/densities will be 
documented.  Grade III and IV bleeds will be considered an SAE.  
 
 Clinical seizures. If clinical seizures are suspected, an EEG will be done to confirm the diagnosis  at the 
Attending phy sician’s discretion . All such results will be recorded.   
 
 Sustained hypertension  requiring medical intervention:  Study drug  should be discontinued if blood 
pressure requires treatment.   When blood pressure returns to normal range (systolic blood pressure < 
100 mmHg ), study drug can be resumed. This is true even if patient is still being treated, but blood  
pressure is being controlled.  
 
 If the  subject requires prolonged antihypertensive therapy (> 1 month) and/or will be discharged on 
medication this is considered an SAE. Medications used to treat hypertension will be recorded.  Any work 
up done to investigate causes of hypertension will be rec orded.   
 
 Patent ductus arteriosus that is treated with either medical or surgical intervention. The indications for 
treatment will be recorded (ECHO parameters  and/or clinical symptoms). Age at treatment will be recorded.  
 
 Sepsis, confirmed by [CONTACT_66623], or presumed (clinical symptoms present and antibiotic 
treatment instituted for 7 -10 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_66533]).  Culture proven sepsis associated with shock 
or significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_66534] n (not study drug).  
 
 Renal (acute or chronic renal failure) and hepatic complications (cholestasis, hepatitis).  
 
 Thyroid function (TSH and free T4) will be collected as available.  
 
 Mortality. The timing and circumstances of any deaths in this study populat ion will be recorded and 
reviewed by [CONTACT_4318].  
 
Data on medication administration, including use of steroids, methylxanthines , antibiotics , diuretics, 
vaso pressors, antihypertensive agents,  sedatives,  anticoagulants, anticonvulsants,  thyroid treatment, and 
indomethacin /ibuprofen  will be collected.  
 
8) Blood samples . Blood (0.5 mL/sample) will be obtained through an indwelling umbilical arterial or venous 
catheter when possible. If no access is available, all efforts will be made to combine the blood draw wi th clinically 
indicated phlebotomy times. The timing of blood draws is shown in Figure 3.  An additional (optional ) blood 
sample will be drawn at the [ADDRESS_72736] identification and date. Samples will be spun, and 
plasma  and cell pellet  frozen at -70°C  to -80°C. Batched samples from each site will be sent to [CONTACT_66671] ’s lab at 
the University of Washington  via FedEx .  
 
Biomarkers.  Plasma  from these samples will be used to investigate the effect of Epo on inflammatory mediators 
and growth factors, as well as Epo pharmacokinetics.  
 
Sample storage.  Samples will be spun on site to separate plasma  from cells. Plasma  and cells will be stored in 
separate, labeled containers at -70ºC to -80°C. They will be sent to the UW in batched quantities, after every 4-
[ADDRESS_72737] will be kept for later study of problems related to prematurity that 
are beyond the scope of this study.  
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page 43 of 75 PENUT Protocol  V6.1 October 14, 2019  
  
Urine samples  will be banked  at the University of Washington  for future analyses of biomarkers, (neutrophil 
gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), osteopontin (OPN), cystatin C (CysC), uromodulin (UMOD), epi[INVESTIGATOR_66535] (EGF) and urine β2 -Microglobulin (β2MG)).    
9) MRI will be done at selected sites at 36 -0/7 to 36 -6/7 weeks PM A using a predefined protocol. If an MRI is 
needed for clinical indications during this time frame, and if the appropriate protocol is utilized, it may be used

10) Neurodevelopmental assessment  will be completed on each subje ct at 22-26 months corrected  age: 
 
 Bayley III Scales of Infant Development: Composite Language and Composite Motor Scale in 5 domains - 
cognitive language (receptive, expressive), motor (fine and gross), social -emotional, and adaptive.176  
 
 Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers  (M-CHAT -R) (Appendix 3) 
 
 Standardized neurological examination  (Appendix 3)

6.4.8 Epo pharmacokinetics . Epo con centrations will be obtained at four time points as outlined in Figure 3 , 
section 5.1 . Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis will be done, and Epo concentrations will also be used to 
document study adherence for subjects assigned to the Epo (and control) arms.  Plasma  for inflammatory 
mediators and biomarkers of brain injury will be obtained at the same blood draw at baseline and study  days [ADDRESS_72738] 
who suffers a SAE due to Epo administration.  The research coordinator and study investigator will evaluate all 
subjects on an ongoing basis for evidence of Epo SAE occurrence.  
  
Criteria for Temporarily Withholding/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_66506]/or Supplemental Iron .  
1. Polycythemia:  Central hematocrit (Hct) > 6 5%: Study drug  should be held until Hct is < 55%. 
2. Severe sepsis : Blood c ulture -proven bacterial or fungal sepsis requiring blood pressure support or 
significant new respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]. Supplemental iron  should be held until blood culture is negative for  72 
hours.  Rationale:  Iron has been reported to  be permissive for selected gram -negative bacteria and might 
worsen the patient's condition during sepsis. There is no known relationship between Epo and sepsi s, 
so study drug does not need to be held.  
3. Unexplained recurrent seizure s (unrelated to ICH, PVL or other known pathology): Study drug  should be 
held until seizures are well controlled by [CONTACT_12617]. Restarting study drug will be determined by [CONTACT_22955], DSMB, and CCC.  
4. Major venous or arterial thrombosis (clot).  
Study drug  should be held for a ny thrombosis that is treated with a course of anticoagulation . 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page 44 of 75 PENUT Protocol  V6.1 October 14, 2019  
 Study drug  should be held for a ny symptomatic  thrombosis involving a major vessel (e.g. symptoms such 
as superior vena cava syndrome) . 
5.  Sustained hypertension  requiring  medical intervention : Study drug  should be discontinued if blood 
pressure requires treatment.  When blood pressure returns to normal range (systolic blood pressure < 100 
mmHg ), study drug can be resumed. This is true even if patient is still being treated , but blood pressure is 
being controlled.   
 
All necessary medical interventions will be available in the event of serious adverse events stemming from a 
subjects involvement in research. All serious adverse events will be monitored closely until resolutio n, and they 
will be recorded and reported to the local IRB  (as required)  as well as the CCC PI ([CONTACT_66671]) who will then notify 
the Medical Monitor as well as the DSMB  and NINDS (via Peter Gilbert) . In the event that a subject is withdrawn 
from the study fo r any reason, all efforts will be made to encourage parents to allow their child to continue to 
participate in follow -up visits.  
 
 
9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1   General Design Issues  
Hypothesis:  Epo treatment from 24 hours to 32 -6/7 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) of Extremely Low 
Gestational Age Neonates  (ELGANs) will safely decrease the combined outcome of death or neurologic 
impairment from 40% to 30% measured at two years of age.  
 
Design :  We will enroll 940/2 = 470 subjects in each of two treatment groups:  Epo -treated (from 24 hours of age 
to 32 -6/7 weeks PMA) vs. placebo control.  
 
Randomization  sequences will be created centrally by [CONTACT_15791]. We will use block randomization within site 
using variable blocks of size 4, 6, 8 and 10 subjects. Using block randomization ensures that equal numbers of 
subjects are randomized to the intervention and control arm and that the two groups are balanced at period 
enrollment intervals. For multiple births (t wins, triplets) all infants will be randomized to the same treatment group 
(e.g. effective randomization of the mother).  
 
Randomization will be stratified on site, gestational age category (24 -25 weeks, 26 -27 weeks), and on the 
number of babies inborn for  a given pregnancy (one, two, three or more).  Rand omization sequences will be 
provided to the research pharmacy at each site through a study binder.  The binder will contain the complete set 
of study IDs and associated randomized assignments and will be ut ilized as a look -up table over the course of 
the study and for each patient’s protocol administration of the study drug. Patient study IDs will utilize the 
following format: <3 digit site code> -XXX-YY, where XXX is the mother ID and YY is the baby [CONTACT_66624] n mother 
(01, 02, 03… etc.). Study IDs within the binder will be listed by [CONTACT_66625].  Singletons, twins and 
triplets are stratified by [CONTACT_66626] [ADDRESS_72739] study IDs  of UOW -201-01 and UOW -201-02. Using Table 7 .1 to look up the mother ID UOW -
201, these two infants will be assigned to receive Epo over the course of the study protocol.

A modified intent -to-treat ( mITT) approach204 will be used, with all randomized infants who receive the first dose 
of study treatment to be included in the analysis. All pre -specified hypotheses will be tested using a two -sided 
type I error of 0.05 with no formal adjustment for multiple comparisons unless otherwise specified (such as with 
safety outcomes). Secondary analyses that focus on separate hypotheses will not require correction for multiple 
comparisons, but those analyses that use multivariate measures such as multiple br ain image parameters would 
be corrected for multiple comparisons using standard methods.  
 
Given that we anticipate enrollment of multiple births we require that all analyses properly account for the within -
sibship correlation of outcomes. We will use Gener alized Estimating Equations (GEE), which is a versatile 
regression approach for the analysis of discrete and continuous outcomes.205 Use of “robust” standard errors will 
provide valid statistical inference and fully account for the clusteri ng of data.  
 
9.2  Outcomes  
Primary outcome variable : The primary outcome is the composite outcome of death or neurodevelopmental 
impairment at 22-26 months  corrected age . Neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) is defined as the presence 
of any one of the following: CP, Bayley III cognitive or motor scale < 70. There is a known inflation of scores from 
the Bayley II to III1, 178, 179 and we will therefore also consider a threshold of <  85 for secondary analysis. Subjects 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_58032] (24 -0/7 to 25 -6/7 and 26 -0/7 to 27 -6/7), number of babies in the pregnancy,  
and by [CONTACT_3885]. Table 8 shows how CP will be c ategorized based on features present on standardized 
neurologic exam.

* It is unlikely that a child with quadriparetic CP will have a GMFCS of 0 -1. However, this scenario is 
possible in cases of bilateral hemiparesis in which arms are more affected than legs. In such cases, the 
bilateral nature of the deficit, and the significant neurologic abnormalities that are noted on a 
standardized neurologic examination, warrant a designation of moderate/severe neurodevelopmental 
impairment.  
QP: quadriplegic; HP: he miplegic; DP: diplegic  
 
 
Primary Analysis:  The primary analysis will be a test of equality of the rate of the primary outcome (death or 
NDI) across the two randomized investigational groups. Specifically, we will use a GEE Wald test based on 
logistic regression, with stratification by [CONTACT_66628] , multiples in gestation  and gestational age. We will 
perform intent to treat analysis and expect minimal non -compliance due to the nature of the intervention in 
relation to in -patient care. For the primary endpoint we expect uniform and complete asc ertainment of death but 
may not evaluate all subjects for developmental impairment. We plan to perform a primary analysis based on 
complete cases and will exclude those subjects for whom vital status is known (alive) but NDI cannot be 
assessed. Sensitivity  analysis will use multiple imputation to evaluate the potential impact of any missing data. 
Secondary analysis will be for quantitative measures of brain volume, and for these endpoints an unadjusted t -
test provides inference regarding the mean response a cross the treatment groups. We will adjust all secondary 
outcome analyses for recruitment site using regression methods.  
 
Power and Sample Size for Primary Outcome:   In order to determine the necessary sample size for efficacy 
evaluation , we need to formul ate assumptions for the primary outcome rate in the treated and untreated groups.  
 
The primary outcome measure is the rate of death or severe neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). Using data 
from two sources , we can compute the expected rates of death or ND I for the neonates that we will enroll. The 
Vermont Oxford Network [ADDRESS_72740] expected trial results for our eligible subjects (24 -27 weeks gestational age).  
 
The VON reports on severe NDI and specifically states that components of severe disability include: cerebral 
palsy, or a Bayl ey score less than 70 or too severely delayed for Bayley testing.206  
 
In addition, data from Ga rgus et al. (2009)[ADDRESS_72741] combined the VON and Gargus (2009) data in order to determine the ant icipated characteristics of our 
proposed trial. While the VON data is contemporary, it has relatively low follow -up for two -year outcomes 
(approximately 50%) and therefore may be biased toward more easily followed or more favorable subjects. Table 
[ADDRESS_72742] estimates of gestational age specific  and overall rates of death and NDI.  
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page 47 of 75 PENUT Protocol  V6.1 October 14, 2019  
 Our assumed 
death rates of 
32, 19, 13 and 9 
percent are 
exactly those 
presented in the 
VON 2008 report, 
and are lower than 
the rates reported 
in Gargus (2009) 
where among 
neonates born 
between [ADDRESS_72743] an overall death rate of 
approximately 18%, which is approximately the rate observed in VON (17%), and is lower than the 26% death 
rate observed for Gargus (2009).  
 
In addit ion, Gargus (2009) report GA -specific rates of NDI as 21, 25, 23, and [ADDRESS_72744] combined VON and Gargus (2009) 
data and further assumed that NDI rates are decreas ing with increasing gestational age to obtain our NDI 
estimates. Using these data we expect an overall NDI rate of 22%, which equals the overall rate observed in the 
VON 2008 report and in Gargus (2009).  
 
In order to estimate the overall rate observed amon g treated neonates , we have assumed that there will be no 
effect of treatment on death, but that Epo will lead to a decrease in the rate of NDI. If we assume a multiplicative 
reduction in the NDI rate of 0.[ADDRESS_72745] a treated NDI rate of 12 percent  and an overall rate of death+NDI 
of 30.4% as compared to the control rate of 40.4%. Therefore, in order to obtain a target sample size we assume:  
an overall control rate of 40%, and an overall treated rate of 30% corresponding to an overall treatment rat e ratio 
of 0.75.  
 
Using the control and treated rates of 40% and 30% respectively leads to a sample size of 376 evaluated subjects 
per arm or a total evaluated sample size of 752 subjects.  
 
Efficacy Trial Statistical Analysis Plan – Secondary Outcomes  
Secondary Aims and Outcomes:  
 To compare safety measures between infants receiving Epo and placebo to determine whether there are 
risks associated with Epo administration.  
 To compare moderate impairment (< 85 on Bayley III cognitive or motor score, or CP).  
 To compare neuroimaging outcomes across the two treatment groups.  
 To assess whether treatment effects vary by [CONTACT_547].  
 To evaluate whether individual biomarkers measured through 36 weeks are predictive of 2 -year outcomes, 
and whether a derived multivariat e combination of markers has predictive performance greater than 
individual marker performance.  
 
Analysis for Secondary Aims and Outcomes:  
 
Safety:  The primary safety outcomes are the serious adverse events and adverse events listed in the CRFs . 
Analysis  will compare the proportion of subjects with an AE across the two treatment groups and will use a [ADDRESS_72746] Network (VON) and Gargus (2009) data showing death 
rates and severe neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) rates for different gestationa l ages 
(GA).

multiple comparisons.  
  
Power:  The expected prevalence of SAEs range from less than 1% for polycythemia, to 18% for death. In order 
to characterize power we show the effect sizes for which we have 80% power based on having n=376 subjects 
evaluated in each group:

20% 30% (RR = 1.5)  31% (RR = 1.5)  
      
Secondary Efficacy Outcome : Our key secondary long-term outcome is the rate of death or NDI using severe or 
moderate impairment defined by a Bayley less than 85. In order to estimate power for the secondary outcome 
we assume the same overall rates for death and severe NDI as above, and then assume a 2 0% rate for moderate 
impairment. Similar to the primary outcome , we assume that the death rate is unchanged by [CONTACT_66629] 22% to 12%. We also assume that the moderate NDI group would have an 
effect similar to the se vere group where the 20% rate would be reduced by a factor of 0.45 to  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11% but that among the 10% of severe subjects impacted by [CONTACT_66630] , half of these would only move from severe to 
moderate impairment. Therefore we assume:  
 
Power:  Using these assumptions and the target evaluated of n=752 leads to greater than 95% power to detect 
a difference on the secondar y outcome . 
 
Imaging Outcomes:   The neuroimaging outcomes are: Myelinated white matter volume; Total gray matter 
volume; and White matter integrity (TBSS FA corpus callosum). We will conduct a single MANOVA test using 
the multivariate outcome and comparing treated and control subjects. The mean and standard deviation will also 
be calculated (by [CONTACT_1570]) for each individual measure. Note that MR measures will be obtained on a 
subset of infants (110 per treatment group).  
 
Given the a priori  hypothesis that treatment effect may differ according to gender we will conduct a single 
subgroup analysis that assesses treatment effects separately for males and for females. Subgroup specific 
treatment effects will be computed and inference will be based on a sing le Gender -by-Treatment test for 
interaction using logistic regression.  
 
Power : Multiple MRI variables will be collected and analyzed in this study. To provide a basic sample size for a 
treatment effect we selected one common basic measure of structural inj ury that has been identified in the 
literature for the premature neonates that we hypothesize will be preserved: The size of the cerebellum tissue 
when compared to the whole head volume. We used a comparable set of T1 weighted brain scans of 22 Control  Treated

Page [ADDRESS_72748]. Assuming age matched groups in the treated and untreated groups, 
from this data we estimate that 110 subjects will be required to see a 5% increase in th e cerebellum size. The 
recognition of cerebellar atrophy in extremely preterm infants has only recently come to light with the increased 
use of MRI.193, 207-212 Cerebellar atrophy has been linked to cognitive as well as motor deficits.209, 213, 214 In 
summary, we will focus on four primary measures that are established to be predictive of 2 -year 
neurodevelopmental status and therefore can be used t o establish support for the hypothesis of long -term benefit 
of Epo treatment. The neuroimaging biomarkers are: 1) myelinated white matter volume; 2) total gray matter 
volume; 3) cerebellar volume and 4) white matter integrity assessed by [CONTACT_66631] (using FA cor pus callosum).  
 
Biomarker Analysis:   We will consider two main classes of potential predictors of 2 -year status:  neuroimaging 
measures and inflammatory markers. Interest is in the prognostic potential of individual and/or combined 
biomarker measurements.  Given that the primary outcome is a binary measure (NDI) , we will evaluate the 
predictive potential of individual quantitative measures using ROC curves showing the full potential of sensitivity 
and specificity across marker cut points. We will compute RO C curves for the (4) primary neuroimaging 
measures, and separately for individual inflammatory markers. Only [ADDRESS_72749] data on the 
inflammatory markers, and these will be the same subjects identified for MR measures. We will derive two 
multiva riate predictive models:  using the inflammatory markers; and using the MR measures. We will use AIC 
and 10 -fold cross -validation to develop and validate predictive models. A final multivariate model will combine 
markers from both MR and inflammatory measu res, and 10 -fold cross -validation will permit inference in the 
incremental value of adding markers in combination by [CONTACT_66632] (AUC).  
 
9.[ADDRESS_72750] chosen sites for this trial that can be expected to enroll a minimum of 24 infants/year in the study.  We 
plan to recruit at [ADDRESS_72751] provided very conservative estimates 
of enrollment, recognizing that some sites will do better, and some worse than predicted. Accordingly, we will 
assess site enrollment every 6 months after initiation of the study. Should enrollment at an individual site fall 
below 6 in a 6 month period, the UW CCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_66536]. If no patients are entered during a 6 month period the Executive 
Committ ee will recommend that the site be dropped and a new site recruited. If a single site appears to be 
enrolling more than 20% of the total infants enrolled in the trial we will temporarily limit enrollment at that site.

In both the phase I/II Epo trial of extremely low birth weight infants and the NEAT trial (Epo neuroprotection of 
term infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy), consent was obtained in over 90% of approached parents. 
This extremely high consent rate reflects the concern parents have about their children’s neurodevelopment, 
and their willingness  to participate in research that might result in improved outcome.

9.4   Data Monitoring  
Per NIH Guidelines (1998), this Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) defines the oversight and monitoring 
  Preterm Epo Neuropro tection Trial (PENUT  Trial)  
 
Page 51 of 75 PENUT Protocol  V6.1 October 14, 2019  
 activities that will ensure and maintain both the safety of participants and the scientific integrity and validity of 
the trial data. The plan also describes the procedures for adverse event reporting and detailed guidelines for 
recommendations related to trial continuation.  
 
PENUT is a multi -center randomized placebo -controlled phase III trial to determine whether recombinant human 
erythropoietin (Ep o) will safely improve the long -term neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants  24-0/7 to 
27-6/7 weeks of gestation. The PENUT study will randomize n=940 subjects to receive either Epo or placebo.  
 
The DSMB will monitor the rates of these comorbidities at 6 month  intervals, comparing the rates in treated and 
control infants. Expected rates will be based on the published literature. For example, in the Network trial, 93% 
had RDS, 46% PDA, 36% had any ICH with 16% severe, 11% NEC, 36% late -onset sepsis, and 12% ROP. In 
the ELGAN study, 21% died by 2 years of age, 24% of all children had an ICH, 12% had moderate/severe 
ventriculomegaly, and 24% had an ultrasound lesions (echodense or lucent).134 
 
Safety Analysis:  For each SAE we will tabulate the event rate by t reatment group, and then compare rates 
using Fisher’s exact test. The DCC will prepare monthly summaries of reported SAEs for review by [CONTACT_22955], the CCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_66539].  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_72755] (DSMB)  
Review of the PENUT trial’s s tudy performance and safety outcomes will be conducted by [CONTACT_66633] (DSMB) as required by [CONTACT_66634] -site clinical investigations. The DSMB consist s of 5 
members with a designated chair  (Ronnie Guillet) , and safety officer  (Jack Widness) .  Committee membership 
include s expertise in both biostatistics and bioethics, and should have clinical expertise appropriate for the 
intervention and target population. The DSMB is expected to meet two times (every 6 months) per year to re view 
study performance and safety outcomes in Open and Closed Reports, and to review study enrollment reports 
quarterly. Ad hoc sessions may be scheduled as required should a serious adverse event need to be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_48990].  
  
Aggregate safety and ef ficacy data and study performance monitoring data will be presented during the open 
sessions of DSMB meetings. Blinded  safety and efficacy data will be presented by [CONTACT_66635]. Review by [CONTACT_66636] t rial can continue without jeopardizing 
patient safety. The DSMB is also responsible for protecting the confidentiality of the trial data and for monitoring 
the quality of both the data and study implementation procedures.   
 
The DCC will work closely with the CCC in developi[INVESTIGATOR_66540] a comprehensive system for safety 
monitoring. Safety monitoring includes the systematic review of safety data for trends that may impact patient 
safety. The processing, reviewing, and reporting of adverse events  (AEs)  and serious adverse events (SAE s) 
are also part of this process. The infants in this study are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66541], and the duration of their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66542]. It ranges from as short as three months to more 
than a year.  
 
Data and Saf ety Monitoring Schedule :  Our target enrollment is n=[ADDRESS_72756] may recommend: continuation of the 
trial, termination of the trial, or modifications to the protocol (e.g. adding new measurements for safety monitoring, 
discontinuing high risk subjects, extending the trial in time, increasing the trial sample). Decision guidelines in 
the PENUT trial are based on group differences in adverse event rates as explained below, and on whether SAE 
rates ex ceed pre -determined thresholds.

Page [ADDRESS_72757] recruitment and eligibility, retention and follow -up, randomization 
and blinding  and quality of data will be conducted and monthly reports generated. Any protocol violation that 
affects patient safety will be reported to the DSMB immediately.  
 
Performance data will be reviewed in aggregate and by [CONTACT_3725]. It is expected that:  
 The response rate for determination of the primary outcome (e.g. 24 month Bayley) will be no less than 
80%; 
 
 Missing interviews will be no greater than 15% at the 4, 8, 12 and 24 month follow -ups; 
 
 The overall enrollment rate will not drop below the expected rate ( 34 subjects per month for 24 months) 
by [CONTACT_726] 25%.  
 
Data will be entered into a central  trial management system utilizing a REDCap database hosted at the DCC.  
Data will be entered into fields with automated validation and logical check built in.  Data will be double entered 
on the outcome measures of Bayley III and CP assessment by [CONTACT_66637].  Compliance will 
be assessed based on the weekly conference calls and data submitted to the DCC on a weekly basis.  If it is 
determined by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_66543] 1) study protocol is not being followed, or 2) that reporting is inadeq uate 
at any site, further action will be taken to address these issues.  These actions may include additional in -person 
site visits if appropriate or additional educational/problem -solving sessions by [CONTACT_66638].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Monitoring:  
The research coordinator at each site will monitor each subject daily for the presence of any complications  until 
discharge . Serious adverse events will be brought to the attention of the CCC PI  ([CONTACT_66671]) who will report them 
to the Medical Monitor  (Jack Widness) , DSMB  and NINDS (via Peter Gilbert) .  Sites will notify their local IRBs of 
SAEs per site institution al requirements . An independent Medical Monitor will review all cases of serious adverse 
events. A potential risk that is unique to preterm infants is the risk of ROP.121 In the published studies of preterm 
neonates receiving potentially neuroprotective doses of Epo, no difference has been noted between treatment 
and control groups .33, 35, 114, 115 
 
As part of the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) we will perform continuous and interim analysis of 
accruing safety data. We have defined potentially treatment (Epo) related serious adverse events (SAEs) that 
will be monitored thro ughout the course of the study. Specifically, for SAEs , we will compare absolute rates to 
expected rates based on published data for similar newborns, and will seek careful DSMB review and guidance 
when observed rates exceed pre -specified thresholds. In ad dition, at planned interim analysis we will formally 
compare the event rates across the two treatment groups using appropriate small sample methods such as 
Fisher’s exact test.

See section [IP_ADDRESS] , Table 1 4. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Treatment Efficacy Monitoring  
Treatment efficacy will be monitored by [CONTACT_4318] , but recognizing that 24 month efficacy outcomes will not be 
obtained until after enrollment is complete (or nearly complete).  Therefore, although formal interim ana lyses will 
be conducted using group -sequential boundaries there may not be compelling reasons to terminate the trial on 
the basis of accruing efficacy data. Efficacy measures will be provided in a blinded fashion to the DSMB with 
treatment groups labeled “ A” and “B” as well as a z -score assessment of the evidence for the difference between

9.4.3   Scheduled R eporting  
One month prior to each DSMB review, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will summarize monthly 
administrative reports that describe study progress including subject accrual by [CONTACT_3725], demographics, and the 
sites’ adherence to inclusion/exclusion cri teria and other protocol requirements, including retention rates at each 
follow -up point. These reports are prepared monthly and reviewed internally by [CONTACT_66639]. The DCC will also produce 
safety reports that list adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths, and disease or treatment specific events 
by [CONTACT_66640] . 
 
With each review the DSMB will approve the study and protocol as is, rec ommend protocol changes in the 
interest of patient safety or stop the study based on overwhelming evidence of treatment benefit or safety 
concerns.  The DSMB will provide the recommendation in written minutes provided to the NIH.  If the NIH concurs 
with t hese recommendations, they will be forwarded to the principal investigator.  The recommendations will 
include any suggested changes in the proposed timing of future DSMB reviews.  The review may result in an 
amendment to the protocol, which must be approved by [CONTACT_1201], the NIH and the sponsor.  
 
The DSMB report will begin with a brief narrative section that describes the status of the study, progress or 
findings to -date, issues, and  the procedures that produced the report (e.g., data obtained by a specific date). 
The report will provide a study description along with a current organization chart, current timetable and study 
schedule as well as a list of study clinical and administrat ive centers. Data will be presented that describe the 
administrative status of the study including recruitment and forms handling. Study data reports describe 
demographic and baseline clinical characteristics and provide a safety assessment. Tables will be  provided by 
[CONTACT_66641]. AE/SAE rates for each group will be presented.  
 
Following each DSMB meeting, the NINDS will send the study’s principal investigator a letter confirming that the 
DSMB met, reviewed all accumulated study data, and made a recommendation that the study continue as 
planned (or, possibly, to modify the protoc ol).  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_66545] a copy of this letter to each 
of the clinical investigators who, in turn, are responsible for forwarding it to their local IRB.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
We divide potential serious adverse eve nts (SAEs) by [CONTACT_66642]:   Below we detail the defined SAEs with 
associated expected event rates and thresholds that would trigger DSMB review. Most of the SAEs would occur 
during the Epo treatment period  or during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66546].

Adverse Event (AE) :  In addition to the monitoring of SAEs , we will also measure and compare rates of adverse 
events across the two treatment arms. Given the high -risk study population a number of adverse events are 
expected, and the key monitoring function will be to assess whether evidence is accruing that sugge sts a 
differential adverse event rate associated with treatment.

Table [ADDRESS_72759] established expected rates of SAEs for 
the target stu dy population, and thresholds for each 
treatment arm at which careful evaluation would be 
required by [CONTACT_66644]. The DSMB would be asked to 
review all information associated with the line listing for 
the SAEs and then make a decision as to whether the 
study should be modified, continued or stopped. In Figure 
8 we show the operating characteristics for an SAE that 
has an expected (normal) rate of 5%, and a threshold of 
10% for review. If the true SAE rate is 1.5 times the 
threshold (e.g. 15%) then with 100  or more subjects there 
is a greater than 80% probability (power) that the 
observed rate of greater than the threshold would occur 
and trigger DSMB review. However, if the true SAE rate 
was only 1.[ADDRESS_72760] 80% power.

The CCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_66547], and the Medical Monitor 
will notify the DSMB if indicated. All events will be reported to the DSMB in semi -annual reports.  
10.0   DATA COLLECTION, SITE MONITORING, AND ADVERSE EVENT 
REPORTING  
10.1   Records to Be Kept  
All patient data will be identified by a Study Identification Number (SID). The link between the SID and the patient 
name/medical record number will be maintained in a locked file available only to the site investigator. This link 
will b e destroyed after study completion, data analysis and publication of results.  Retained medical record 
information will include maternal education, SES, other factors known to affect cognitive development (e.g. drug. 
alcohol exposure), date of birth, birth  weight, medical treatments, complications, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
outcome measures including neurodevelopmental examination results , Bayley III test results, and neuroimages. 
All retained data will be coded with a SID so no direct link will be availab le to others besides the site investigator.  
 
Data Storage and Security  
Access to research data collected by [CONTACT_66646]. The clinical recruitment sites will maintain a secure electronic database (e.g. Access, 
MySQL, REDCap, etc.) that links the SID generated by [CONTACT_66647]. 
The clinical recruitment sites are responsible for scheduling patient follow -up visits, phone calls, and collectio n 
of survey data. The database will be stored on a secure electronic server with user name [CONTACT_66670].  
 
The REDCap servers are virtual machines (VMs) located on UW DCC hardware in a secure server  room. This 
server room meets the technical requirements for HIPAA compliance and hosts other servers containing PHI.  
 
Storage for all study data is backed by 2 dedicated Network Appliance FAS2050 storage appliances. The filer 
provides highly fault tolera nt storage using large RAID volumes, on -line hot -spare drives, and built -in, proprietary 
'snapshot' file system technology that automatically creates hourly, daily, and weekly on -line backups of modified 
files. Each filer provides approximately 2.6 terabyt es (2.6TB) of usable storage space.  
 
The VM Operating System will be kept fully patched and firewalled in accordance with UW Medicine Information 
Security Policy SEC05.04, which can be found online at http://security.uwmedicine.org/policies.     
 
The UW DCC maintains a Linux -based infrastructure server that uses and manages a central department 
storage server.  A Silicon Mechanics SM -1272A rack -mount server installed in the UW DCC server room rack 
and an HP dc5750 desktop PC are installed as so -called “lo gical firewalls”, such that that all PCs and operate 
on a private logical network.  
 
10.2   Role of Data Management  
10.2.1  Each clinical site will be responsible for data collection on enrolled subjects and data entry into the 
REDCap system. Once the study  is complete as described in 10.1, each clinical site will be responsible for 
destruction of link s and any retained clinical information.

inspection by [CONTACT_66649].  
 
Data Quality Assurance.  We will monitor the accuracy of da ta entry by [CONTACT_66650]. 
We will review study data on arrival for completeness. We will then subject each submitted data set to a set of 
preliminary checks to search for values that are out -of-range or otherwise inappropriate.  
 
External monitoring will consist of regular monitoring visits to every site while actively enrolling. Initial monitoring 
visits will take place prior to subject enrollment, and then every six to 12 months. Using the Patient Monitoring 
Report ( example below), a subset of all data points in the CRFs will be compared with the medical record  for 
25% of enrolled subjects . Any outstanding data queries will be resolved with the research coordinator at the time 
of the visit. After each study site visit a report w ill be prepared and copi[INVESTIGATOR_66548], the study PI (S.

 10.4   Serious Adverse E vent Reporting  
Since reporting rules vary by [CONTACT_14189], by [CONTACT_1744], and by [CONTACT_66651] (NIH), the fo llowing statements are 
a conservative guide to reporting serious adverse events for this trial and may be further refined with DSMB 
guidance.  
 
When an SAE occurs, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_66549] (S. Juul) will be notified by [CONTACT_11255] 24 -72 hours per protocol  (see 
Figure 9) . She , or her designee, is responsible for reporting the SAE to the Medical Monitor (Jack Widness ), the 
DSMB  and NINDS  (via Peter Gilbert) .  The immediate reports will be followed promptly by [CONTACT_12908], written 
reports  within 3 -7 days per pro tocol .  SAE reporting will also follow the requirements of the local IRB and the 
FDA.   SAEs and/or laboratory abnormalities identified in the protocol as critical to participant safety must be 
reported. All SAEs experienced by [CONTACT_66652] (from the 
time of study drug administration to discharge) are to be reported .  A death, found at any time point, including 
follow -up, should be reported.  The DCC will provide monthly summaries of all SAEs to the CCC P I, DCC PI, 
Medical Monitor, and Peter Gilbert (NINDS). The Medical Monitor is responsible for notifying the FDA when 
indicated.

Page [ADDRESS_72767] (IRB) Review and Informed Consent  
This protocol and the informed consent  document and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_66653].  A signed consent form will be 
obtained from the subject’s parent, legal guardian, or person with power of attorney.  The consent form will 
describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks a nd benefits of participation.  A 
copy of the consent form will be given to the subject, parent, or legal guardian, and this fact will be documented 
in the subject’s record. A model informed consent form is included in Appendix 1.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_72768] Confidenti ality 
The UW DCC will support an https secured web page ( https://www.penut -trial.org ) that provides a centralized 
location for information about the Preterm Epo Neuropro tection (PENUT) Trial for patients, providers, 
investigators, and institutional agencies. The web page will also contain a link to the PENUT Portal 
https://www.penut -trial.org/portal  where all research personnel will log in with indiv idual user names and 
passwords to securely perform study data management activities.  
 
The PENUT Portal controls the assignment of sequentially generated Study Identification Numbers (SID) for all 
patients screened under the PENUT project. All patient conta ct information will be linked to the SID within 
databases hosted at the clinical recruitment sites and in a REDCap database at the DCC that stored separately 
from all other study or clinical data.   
 
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, vid eo recordings, and other records that leave the site will 
be identified only by [CONTACT_66654].  All records will be kept in a locked file cabinet at 
each site.  All computer entry and networking programs will be done using SID s only.  Clinical information will 
not be released without written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, 
the NINDS, the OHRP, the sponsor, or the sponsor’s designee.  
 
Upon conclusion of the study, subjects’  families or legally authorized representative  may be notified of their 
child’s study arm assignment. This information will be generated by [CONTACT_15791], and given to sites to distribute in 
a confidential way appropriate to the ir IRB’s  guidelines .  
 
Certain aspects of the subject's medi cal history and demographics will be collected for this study. Loss of privacy 
may lead to problems with insurability or social stigmatization. However, all data will be collected by [CONTACT_66655] t privacy. A  Certificate of Confidentiality from the [LOCATION_002] Department 
of Health and Human Services  (DHHS)  will be obtained by [CONTACT_66656] [INVESTIGATOR_66550], to protect the subjects' 
confidential information.  With this Certificate, study investigators  cannot be forced (for example by [CONTACT_66657]) to disclose information that may identify subject, subject’s parent, legal guardian, or person with 
power of attorney  any federal, state, local, civil, legislative, administrative, or other proceeding s. The researchers 
will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify any specific individual , except to 
prevent serious harm to anyone . 
 
11.3    Study Modification/Discontinuation  
The study may be modified or discontinued a t any time by [CONTACT_4318], IRB, the NINDS, the sponsor, the OHRP, 
the FDA, or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research subjects are protected.

prior to submission .  (Please see Appendix 4). A proposal for a manuscri pt will be initiated by [CONTACT_17258] a 
structured summary proposal that includes an analysis plan. All proposal s will be reviewed by [CONTACT_66658] s 
and Presentation s and Executive Committee s. Similarly, all abstracts, presentations, and publications must also 
be approved by [CONTACT_66658] s and Presentation s and Executive Committee s, and it will be the responsibility 
of the DCC to ensure that the process is transparent and timely.  An Excel spreadsheet or the study website will 
include a searchable list of all analysis proposals and will track their status toward publication.  
 
We expect that Epo treatment will improve NDI -free survival compared to that seen in the ELGAN and NICHD 
trials. We expect that this benefit will translate into shorter and less compli cated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66551]. This outcome of the trial would represent an important advance in the care of 
ELGANs that could change the standard of care for high -risk infants. If Epo treatment has no demonstrable 
benefit, or  if adverse effects are observed, this information will also be useful in the field because Epo is currently 
used anecdotally in many NICUs, without trial -based evidence, for some severely ill infants. The results of the 
PENUT trial will be of particular i nterest to pediatricians trained in neonatal -perinatal medicine. This group of 
practitioners is largely centered in academic or medical centers and they attend several meetings each year 
where new information about treatment can be presented. The PENUT tri al results will be presented at regional 
Pediatric Research Society meetings such as the Western and Eastern Society for Pediatric Research, and at 
national and international meetings including the Pediatric Academic Societies combined meetings, the 
Europe an Society for Pediatric Research meeting, the American Academy of Pediatrics meetings, and at other 
venues such as “Hot Topi[INVESTIGATOR_1517]”.

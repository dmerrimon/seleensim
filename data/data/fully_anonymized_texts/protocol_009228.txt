 2 Introduction  
Neuromuscular blockers (NMB) are medications commonly used by [CONTACT_474220]/muscle relaxation and facilitate the technical performance of 
surgery. However,  the residual effect of neuromuscular blockade during the imme diate 
postoperative period has been associated with an increased incide nce of postoperative pulmonary  
complications.  1-6. Residual neuromuscular blockade is a cont ributing factor to adverse events 
including delayed discharge from recovery, need for tracheal reintubation, impaired oxygenation 
and ventilation, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], atelectasis and pneumonia.  3,6,[ADDRESS_607478] from older , long-acting 
NMB agents (e.g. pancuronium) toward the intermediate -acting agents (e.g. rocuronium or 
cisatracurium) commonly used during non -cardiac su rgery.12-[ADDRESS_607479] of neuromuscular  
blockade on early  (<[ADDRESS_607480] -ICU admission ) postoperative respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800] . This 
clinical study will prospectively investigate two groups of patients undergoing elective cardiac 
surgery at the Unive rsity of Chicago.  In the experimental  group, a very short -acting depolarizing 
NMB (succinylcholine) will be used for tracheal intubation  and no other subsequent  muscle 
relaxants t hroughout surgery.  In the control group , an intermediate -acting non -depolarizing 
NMB (cisatracurium) will be used thro ughout the intraoperative period (our standard practice)  
and will be re -administered to maintain a moderate to deep level of musc le relaxation until  the 
conclusion  of surgery .  Both groups will be monitored with peripheral nerve stimulators (ulnar 
and facial nerve) throughout the intraoperative period and immediate p ostoperative period. 
Residual neuromuscular blockade during the immediate postoperative period will be assessed in 
both groups  objectively and subjectively.  
 [ADDRESS_607481] limited access to the patient ’s arms due to patient positioning, both the 
adductor pollicis and orbicularis oculi sites will be monitored with a TOF -Watch to provide for 
correlation as well as redundancy in the event of intraoperative disturb ance of the adductor 
pollicis site due to surgeon positioning.  
The primary outcome to be examined is  the composite event of a postoperative 
pulmonary complication  linked to resi dual NMB. Surgical tolerability  (assessed via specifically 
designed cardiac sur geon rating scale  and examination of undesired patient movement during 
anesthesia ) and subjective/objective signs of postoperative weakness (patient questionnaire, 
neuromuscular blockade monitoring)  are the secondary outcomes to be assessed . 
 
Methods 
 A prospective, randomized protocol was de signed to assess the impact of  low/single dose NMB 
on the incidence of early respi[INVESTIGATOR_474203].  Reported incidence of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_474204] s from 0.5 -30% depending upon the 
particular complication  and population subset  being examined. The current study focuses on a 
pre-defined composite measure of respi[INVESTIGATOR_474205] -
associated effects on respi[INVESTIGATOR_65208].  This primary outcome measure will include 
the following  and will be determined through prospective observation  for 72 hours following 
admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively .  (See “Data Collection: Respi[INVESTIGATOR_474206]”)

 Blinded assessment of p atient experience of  weakness  or respi[INVESTIGATOR_474212]  (See “Postoperative Survey”)  
Study Risk and Benefits  
When continuous muscle relaxation is omitted, there is a risk of movement under 
anesthesia (e.g. coughing, limb muscle movement), which may interfere with surgery. Movement 
under anesthesia occurs occasionally even when muscle relaxation is provided contin uously 
(during standard of care), but in the absence of muscle relaxation (non -standard of care), these 
movements may be more pronounced. Other anesthesia medications (i.e. anesthetic agents, 
 7 analgesic agents) are provided when muscle relaxation is not bei ng administered to minimize 
these risks. In our study, midazolam and fentanyl (standard of care medications) will be 
administered in doses to avoid the potential for inadvertent movement. In the low dose muscle 
relaxant group, inadvertent patient movement will be treated with additional anesthesia with 
propofol, increasing the dose of volatile anesthetic, administering pain medication or if necessary 
for patient safety, administering muscle relaxants as required (i.e. reverting to standard of care). 
The risk of movement under anesthesia when low dose muscle relaxant is used is reasonable 
because providing anesthesia without muscle relaxation is an established technique used for other 
types of surgery (e.g. n on cardiac).  
As muscle relaxation has been associat ed with harmful effects (e.g. postoperative 
pulmonary complications), the use of low doses ha s some potential benefit . Results from this 
study may help future patients having cardiac surgery by [CONTACT_474223][INVESTIGATOR_11800].  
Monitoring of Safety  
There will be ongoing (case by [CONTACT_23353]) review of adverse events and safety information 
between the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators and any events will be addressed. 
Unanticipated problems req uiring a revision to the protocol will be sub mitted to the IRB for 
review. A Data Safety Monitoring Board has been convened and will review the results early in 
the study as well as halfway through enrolment to address any safety concerns. A continuing 
review with examination of preliminary data will be conducted after [ADDRESS_607486] been 
recruited. 
Unanticipated problems (i.e. unexpected events that are related or possibly related to 
participation in the research that suggest that the research places sub jects or others at risk of 
unknown harm or increased frequency of harm) will be reported to the IRB within 10 working 
 8 days of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. In the event of a fatal or life -threatening 
unanticipated problem, enrolment will be ha lted and the IRB chair notified by [CONTACT_147858]. A major deviation from the protocol will be reported within 10 working days via 
the “Unanticipated Problem” form. A minor deviation will be summarized at the time of 
continuing review on the “Continuing  Review Form”.  
Power Calculation:  
Previous studies of respi[INVESTIGATOR_474213] d 
incidence rates ranging from 0.5 -30%.26,27,33-35 Many of the se studies include  atelectasis and 
pleural effusions in their composite calculation of respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800] , which are 
problematic because of diagnostic difficulty and less clear relati onship to NMB use. The current  
study will focus solely on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_474214] s previously defined. Assuming  this 
composite  has a potential incidence of 20% and that the effect size  is 0.5, a total of 47  patients 
will be required in each arm to achieve a pow er of 80% with a p=0.05. A total of 100 patients 
will be recruited  to account for crossover .  
Inclusion Criteria  
All patients >18  years old undergoing elective cardiac surgery  (coronary artery by[CONTACT_15694] [CABG], valve replacement or CABG + valve repla cement) requiring cardiopulmonary 
by[CONTACT_474224] ([CONTACT_474234]  or [CONTACT_474235] ). 
Exclusion criteria 
Emergency surgery, extremes of age (<18 or >90 years), previous cardiac surgery, clinical 
contraindications to succinylcholine or cisatracurium, anticipated difficult tracheal intubation, 
preoperative mechanical ventilation, preoperative pharmacologic/mech anical hemodynamic 
support. 
Study Protocol  
 [ADDRESS_607487] protocol (Group CIS) or the single -dose NMB protocol (Group 
SUX) (See “Intraoperative Protocol”).  All study and anesthetic drugs will be administered by [CONTACT_474225]. The neuromuscular blocking agents being studied will be dispensed by [CONTACT_474226], as is routine, and drawn up in the operating room for intravenous 
administration.  ICU providers and surgeons will be blinded to the study group assignment, and 
intraoperative and postop erative care will otherwise be routine.  
No compensation will be provided to study participants. Patients will be identified by 
[CONTACT_474227]. The data set created from  study information will be maintained following study 
completion but all patient identifiers will be deleted. This will be maintained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_607488] the following data points .

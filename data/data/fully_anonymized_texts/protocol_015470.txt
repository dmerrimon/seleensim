2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Study Disease
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are lethal hematologic 
malignancies associated with a poor prognosis. The estimated number of deaths from AML is 
nearly as many as the incidence of new diagnoses. While the majority of patients with AML 
achieve a complete remission with conventional cytotoxic induction therapy, approximately half 
subsequently relapse and most die from their disease (Dohner 2015, Tefferi 2009, Gangat 2016). 
Outcomes are far worse for those with relapsed or high-risk AML, such as those with adverse 
cytogenetics or with a history of preceding myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative conditions. 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is recommended as an appropriate 
consolidative approach for suitable patients with higher risk disease. The ongoing 
characterization of prognostically important chromosomal and molecular alterations in AML has 
engendered hope that novel and effective targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57870].
2.2 IDH Inhibitors
Genomic sequencing of myeloid malignancies, including MDS and AML, has recently led to the 
discovery of a series of mutations, including those impacting the genes encoding isocitrate 
dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) (Mardis 2009). Sequence analysis has shown that IDH mutations occur 
in ~ 5% of patients with MDS and 10% of patients with secondary AML. (Kosmider 2010). 
IDH1 is an important metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to α-
ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the cytosol, leading to the production of reduced nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), while IDH2 is a homologous protein catalyzing this reaction 
in mitochondria. IDH1/2 mutations are frequently-found alterations in AML (approximately 5% 
with IDH1 and 15% with IDH2 mutations), gliomas and secondary glioblastomas (Ducray 2009), 
and have also been detected less commonly in other malignancies. These recurrent mutations are 
missense alterations affecting arginine 132 (R132) of IDH1, and either the analogous arginine 
residue (R172) or arginine 140 (R140) of the IDH2 protein (Mardis 2009, Gross 2010, Marcucci 
2010, Paschka 2010, Ward 2010).
The identification of neomorphic IDH1/2 enzyme activity associated with underlying mutations 
provided a promising therapeutic direction in the treatment of AML and MDS (Abbas 2010, 
DiNardo 2016, Medeiros 2017). In place of catalyzing the normal process of isocitrate 
decarboxylation, the altered IDH proteins instead facilitate a reduction of α-KG to 2-
hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (Dang 2009), a metabolite normally present at very low levels. 2-HG 
has since been shown to directly confer oncogenic activity, likely through interfering with 
regulation of gene transcription controlled by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_57871] (Xu 
2011, Figueroa 2010). These findings have helped encourage the development of IDH1 and 
IDH2 inhibitors, which demonstrated great promise in preclinical evaluation. They are now

8being actively studied in clinical trials, with very encouraging results, suggestive of effective 
clinical activity. Rates of remission, partial remission, and stable disease for enasidenib and 
ivosidenib are remarkable for such patients, including many with relapsed and refractory IDH-
mutant disease.  Enasidenib is now approved for use by [CONTACT_57916]/refractory IDH2-mutated AML.
The initial promise of IDH inhibitors has garnered interest to better understand the most optimal 
manner by [CONTACT_57917][INVESTIGATOR_57872]1/2-mutant myeloid malignancies. Given the increasing employment and success of HSCT 
in patients with intermediate or high-risk AML (Davies 2008), as well as in those with 
myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative neoplasms, the role of novel targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57873]-free and overall survival. Maintenance following HSCT is routinely used with 
available inhibitors of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML) (Klyuchnikov 2010), or Philadelphia chromosome positive- acute lymphoid leukemia 
(Kebriaei 2012), even without any prospective trials showing a clear benefit. There is evidence, 
however, that introducing BCR-ABL inhibitors at the time of detectable minimal residual disease 
following HSCT can induce long-term remissions in CML (Hess 2005). In addition, anecdotal 
reports, followed by [CONTACT_57918], suggest substantial promise in using FLT3 
inhibitors, such as sorafenib, as maintenance therapy in FLT3-ITD mutated AML patients 
following HSCT (Chen 2014). As an increasing number of targeted and well-tolerated therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57874], the paradigm of maintenance therapy after HSCT will likely garner more 
attention, suggesting a need to conduct well-informed clinical trials to assess efficacy, 
tolerability, and cost-effectiveness of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
2.3 Ivosidenib
The investigational drug ivosidenib (AG-120) is a selective, potent inhibitor of the isocitrate 
dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutant protein. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is a critical enzyme in the 
citric acid cycle catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to produce carbon dioxide 
(CO 2) and alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG). The mutant IDH enzymes are not catalytically inactive, 
but rather possess a novel enzyme activity, catalyzing the reduction of α-KG to the 
“oncometabolite” 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (Dang 2009) which has been found to be elevated 
in patients with several tumor types, including both solid and liquid tumors (Fathi 2012, DiNardo 
2013, Janin 2014). 
Initial studies sought to identify IDH1 mutant-selective inhibitors that can suppress 2-HG 
production in cancer cells. AG-120 is a selective inhibitor of IDH1 (R132) mutant enzymes with 
concentrations of drug that achieved half maximal inhibition (IC 50) in the range of 2 to 17 nM. 
Ivosidenib is also a slow binding inhibitor of IDH1 wild-type (WT) enzymes with an IC 50 of 71 
to 24 nM following incubation with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) for 
either 1 or 16 hours, respectively. Ivosidenib showed no inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 
(IDH2) isoforms at micromolar concentrations. 
The results of a series of nonclinical PK studies, including both single dose and multiple dose 
evaluations, in Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys showed that

9ivosidenib has an acceptable ADME profile for continued evaluation and development in 
humans. The toxicity profile of ivosidenib was evaluated in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation, 
a micronucleus, and a phototoxicity assay and in vivo in Sprague-Dawley rats, cynomolgus 
monkeys, and New Zealand white rabbits, including two 28-day and two 3-month repeat-dose 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_57875], definitive embryo/fetal development studies 
in rats and rabbits and a micronucleus study in rats. Preliminary clinical data have shown 
ivosidenib to be generally well-tolerated at the doses evaluated. Substantial reductions in mean 
plasma 2-HG concentrations have been observed in patients treated with ivosidenib, as well as 
evidence of clinical activity. 
An in vitro study of human liver microsomes using chemical inhibitors and recombinant human 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes suggested that ivosidenib is mainly metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, 
with minor contributions from CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. Therefore, coadministration with 
CYP3A4 inhibitors could have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of ivosidenib. 
The AG-[ADDRESS_63176]-in- 
human studies, Study AG120-C-001 in subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies that 
harbor an IDH1 mutation and Study AG120-C-002 in subjects with advanced solid tumors, 
including glioma, that harbor an IDH1 mutation. Two combination studies in subjects with 
newly diagnosed AML are also ongoing. Study AG120-221-C-001 is evaluating treatment with 
AG-120 or AG-221 (an IDH2 mutant inhibitor) in combination with standard AML induction 
and consolidation therapy in subjects with AML who are eligible for intensive chemotherapy and 
Study AG-221-AML-005 is assessing the treatment with AG-120 or AG-221 in combination 
with azacitidine in subjects with AML not eligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. 
Dose escalation has stopped in Studies AG120-C-001 and AG120-C-002. A dose of 500 mg QD 
has been identified to be used in the expansion arms of both studies to further evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of AG-120 in subjects with advanced malignancies; 500 mg QD is also the dose 
being used in the 2 Phase 1/2 combination studies of AG-120 and in the initiated/planned Phase 
[ADDRESS_63177] shown AG-120 to be well tolerated at total daily doses up to 1200 mg; the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in either of the dose escalation studies 
(DiNardo 2015; DiNardo 2016). 
The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) observed in subjects with cancer 
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile of ivosidenib. The most common AEs in Study 
AG120- C-001 were diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), fatigue (26%), febrile neutropenia (22%), 
and leukocytosis (22%); in Study AG120-C-002, nausea (28%), fatigue (28%), and diarrhea 
(23%) were the most common AEs. 
2.4 Rationale
Given that a substantial proportion of patients with IDH1/2-mutant myeloid malignancies are 
likely candidates for, and will undergo HSCT as a therapeutic modality for their disease, as well 
as the promise suggested by [CONTACT_57919]-HSCT setting, it is 
important to establish the safety and tolerability of these agents in the post-transplant setting as

10well as to gain an appreciation of their efficacy in maintaining relapse-free survival in this 
patient population. The primary goal of this phase I study is to define the recommended phase 2 
dose (R2PD) of the mIDH1 inhibitor, ivosidenib (AG-120), as maintenance therapy following 
HSCT. 
2.5 Correlative Studies Background
2.5.1 2-hydroxyglutarate levels
An intriguing finding in IDH-mutant AML is elevated levels of the oncometabolite 2-HG.  Initial 
studies of patient samples revealed greater than 50-fold higher levels of 2-HG, when compared 
to those from IDH-WT patients (Ward 2010). 2-HG levels were then measured in sera and 
leukemic blasts from a limited number of patients with IDH-mutant AML. The IDH-mutant 
samples exhibited elevations of 2-HG above 1,000ng/ml in serum, in contrast to IDH wild-type 
samples (Gross 2010).
We have ongoing efforts to monitor 2-HG levels in IDH-mutant patients undergoing traditional 
chemotherapy for AML. To date, we have noted markedly elevated levels of circulating 2-HG in 
multiple fluid compartments, including blood, urine, and marrow (Fathi 2012). We found that 
blood and urine 2-HG levels, serially measured during therapy, directly parallel therapeutic 
response, and may serve as biomarkers of clinical activity. Assessing levels of a surrogate non-
invasive biomarker, such as 2-HG, may allow clinicians to better prognosticate, risk-stratify, and 
manage patients with AML.
2.5.2 Next-generation sequencing (NGS)
IDH1/[ADDRESS_63178] of IDH 
mutations has been evaluated in multiple retrospective studies to date, with largely inconclusive 
results (Patel 2012, Mardis 2009, Marcucci 2010, Paschka 2010). IDH allelic burden has not 
been extensively studied. Based on data from three IDH-mutant patients receiving induction 
chemotherapy, we found that 2-HG levels correlated with IDH-mutational burden during the 
course of treatment. Through next-generation sequencing (NGS) of serial samples, we found that 
IDH1/2 mutational burden (mutant allele as fraction of total IDH reads) decreased over time 
concordantly with serum 2-HG. Based on these preliminary data, it appears that 2-HG levels, 
along with assessment of IDH mutational burden, may parallel the clinical course of IDH mutant 
disease and its response to treatment. We will use next-generation sequencing to assess IDH1 
mutational burden in our participants. 
2.5.3 Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revealed extensive clonal heterogeneity in AML.  The 
initial (“Founding”) clone contains 500-1000 somatic mutations on average. Subclones 
frequently emerge, either during the natural history of the disease, or at relapse following 
therapy. Subclones acquire additional mutations, but retain all mutations present in ancestral 
clones (Welch 2012, Ding 2012, Jan 2012, Walter 2012). 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-123

11The sequence of mutations acquired by [CONTACT_57920], as they transform, is informative 
since it can distinguish initiating mutations from those which are cooperating alterations. IDH1/2 
mutations are often present in the founding clone (and, therefore, are retained in subclones) 
(Ding 2012, Walter 2012). Little is known about the relative sensitivity of IDH-mutant vs. 
wildtype clones to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy or the impact of targeted therapy on the 
clonal architecture of IDH mutant AML.
Indeed, the landscape of leukemic subpopulations is dynamic and evolves over time, either due 
to progression of disease, or in response to selective pressure from treatment (Jan 2012). The 
clonal architecture, comprised of subclones with distinct mutational profiles, can vary during the 
course of treatment, and a small subclone present at diagnosis may develop into the dominant 
clone at relapse. Through whole genome sequencing, we will more fully characterize the clonal 
architecture and evolution of relapse of IDH-mutant AML. 
2.5.4 Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)
In the phase [ADDRESS_63179] cleared the mutant (mIDH1) allelic burden (Stone 2017).  
Indeed, MRD-negativity was observed in 7 of 25 (28%) R/R AML patients who achieved CR, 
and those with MRD-negative CR had improved CR duration and overall survival, albeit the 
dataset was small. MRD-negativity by [CONTACT_57921]1 status was also observed in [ADDRESS_63180] clearance by 
[CONTACT_57922]1 allelic burden at time points throughout the study.

4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 
4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) 
OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of protocol-specific therapy. Any 
participant not registered to the protocol before protocol-specific therapy begins will be 
considered ineligible and registration will be denied.
An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the 
protocol-specific eligibility checklist.
Following registration, participants may begin protocol-specific therapy. Issues that would cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If a participant 
does not receive protocol-specific therapy following registration, the participant’s registration on 
the study must be canceled. Registration cancellations must be made in OnCore as soon as 
possible. 
4.2 Registration Process for DF/HCC Institutions
DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject Protocol 
Registration (SOP #: REGIST-101) must be followed.

5. TREATMENT PLAN
5.1 Treatment Regimen
Ivosidenib will be administered orally every day for 28 consecutive days, defined as a treatment 
cycle. Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6.  Reported adverse events and 
potential risks are described in Section 7.  No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57878]'s 
myeloid malignancy.

CONFIDENTIAL
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.
16The starting dose of ivosidenib (AG-120) will be 500mg orally daily. After 3 (or 6) participants 
are treated at 500mg daily, if this dose is tolerated, then an additional 10 participants will be 
treated at 500mg daily. If the 500mg daily dose is NOT tolerated in the initial cohort of 
participants, then the dose will be decreased to 250mg daily. If 250mg daily is tolerated, then an 
additional 10 participants will be treated at 250mg daily. The only doses studied will be 500mg 
daily and 250mg daily (the latter, if necessary). 
The first cohort will consist of three participants. After the third participant is enrolled to the 
cohort, enrollment will be put on hold until all three participants have completed the first 28-day 
cycle. The period for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation is the first 28-day cycle. Individual 
participants must receive at least 50% of the dosing to be DLT evaluable for that cohort. If this 
criteria is not met, the patient in that dose-escalation cohort may be replaced.
If one of three participants in a cohort experiences a DLT, then an additional 3 participants will 
be observed at that dose. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined as the highest dose 
level at which 0 or 1 of six participants experiences a dose-limiting toxicity. 
Dose Escalation Schedule
Dose Level Dose of Ivosidenib
Level 1 250mg daily
Level 2 – Starting Dose 500mg daily
Once the RP2D is defined, an additional 10 participants will be enrolled at that dose. 
If 250mg daily dosing is not tolerated, then the study will end without expansion. 
If the overall study is dose decreased to 250mg daily and there are still any participants receiving 
500mg daily ivosidenib, those participants may continue to receive 500mg ivosidenib 
unless/until they develop a toxicity that requires a dose-reduction. 
The participant will be required to maintain a medication diary of each dose of medication. 
He/she should record relevant information regarding study drug dosing in the diary (e.g. 
confirmation that each dose was taken, reasons for missed doses). The medication diary will be 
returned to clinic staff at the end of each cycle.

5.3 Agent Administration
Ivosidenib will be given orally (PO) once daily (QD) in 28-day continuous cycles. Dosing should 
occur at approximately the same time each day. 
Ivosidenib may be taken with or without food. If it is taken with food, participants should be 
advised to avoid consuming with a high-fat meal. All participants will be advised to avoid 
grapefruit and grapefruit products.

participant forgets to take the daily dose, he/she should make up the dose within [ADDRESS_63196] should resume treatment with the next scheduled dose. 
Dosing will be escalated as described above in section 5.1.  
5.4 Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) 
Dose-limiting toxicities will be evaluated during cycle 1 (first 28 days) of treatment. Toxicities 
will be graded and documented according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03. 
Non-hematologic DLTs will be defined as any drug-related grade 3 or greater event.
The following exceptions will NOT be considered DLTs in this population:
grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts ≤ 72 hours and responds to medical 
intervention
Hematologic DLTs will be defined as any drug-related grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500/µL) or 
thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25,000/µL) that 
has not resolved to grade 1 or less within 14 days of holding ivosidenib, or
resolves within 14 days, but then recurs after resuming study drug
Note that anemia is not included as a DLT. 
Additionally, febrile neutropenia of any duration, and not due or attributable to the underlying 
disease or other extraneous causes such as infection, will be considered a DLT.
In addition, any ≥ grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity that the participant finds intolerable or 
renders the participant unable to take 75% of the assigned doses (e.g. multiple dose interruptions) 
during the first cycle will be considered a DLT.
Management and dose modifications associated with the above events are outlined in Section 6.
Dosing will proceed within each cohort according to the following scheme. 
Number of observed 
DLTs at a Given Dose 
LevelDecision Rule
0/33 additional evaluable patients will be treated at the dose level. If 
<=1 of the 6 treated patients experience a DLT, this is the RP2D. If 
>=2 of the 6 treated patients experience a DLT and current dose is 
dose level 2, de-escalate to dose level 1.
≥2 De-escalate to dose level 1 if current dose is dose level 2.

b) If ≥1 of these 3 additional patients experience DLT, then de-
escalate to dose level 1 if current dose is dose level 2.
≤1/6 Current dose is the RP2D
Subsequent (after cycle 1) cycles of ivosidenib will continue, with participants monitored for 
toxicity and adverse event reporting, but will not be used for DLT evaluation. 
5.5 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines
Ivosidenib (AG-120) is a substrate and a potential inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Co-
administration of AG120 with drugs primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2B6 or 3A4 may result in 
decreased plasma concentrations of the co-administered drug. Therefore, concurrent use of 
CYP3A4 substrates should be avoided when possible, but when medically necessary, appropriate 
dose adjustments of the co-administered drug may be necessary. Examples of CYP3A4 
substrates with narrow therapeutic index include cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and 
tacrolimus. Careful monitoring of drug levels of immunosuppressant agents is required. Careful 
consideration should be given to whether participants require the use of azoles and quinolones. 
An appendix E outlines list of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 substrates, and inducers. 
Concomitant administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is predicted to increase ivosidenib 
steady-state C max by [CONTACT_8622] 52% and AUC by [CONTACT_8622] 90% which may increase the risk of QTc 
interval prolongation. Treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is allowed on this study when 
they are medically necessary and cannot be avoided or substituted with another medication.  
However dose adjustment will be necessary with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (listed in Appendix 
E) are used concurrently.  This will be outlined in section 6.4.  Additionally, the investigators 
must monitor for any changes in toxicity or QT interval, as outlined in section 6.5. Monitoring of 
subjects receiving study treatment with the combination of these drugs is essential. Providers and 
investigators should evaluate ECG and electrolytes (including potassium, magnesium, and 
calcium) at least weekly for the first cycle of therapy.  Vigilance is particularly important in 
subjects presenting with nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Intrathecal chemotherapy for the purposes of prophylaxis is allowed. Intrathecal chemotherapy 
for the purpose of treating active leukemic disease is not allowed. 
If treatment pauses are necessary, per guidance below, due to adverse events on study, if and 
when ivosidenib is held in the midst of a cycle, the cycle day will not change, and once the drug 
is resumed it will be either on the day that that cycle has progressed to, or if the pause is beyond 
28 days of that cycle, the resumption will be called the day 1 of the subsequent cycle.

205.5.1 Prolonged QT Interval 
Participants may be at increased risk for the development of QT prolongation when treated with 
ivosidenib (AG-120) in combination with fluoroquinolones, azole antifungal agents or serotonin 
(5-HT3) antagonists. Therefore, treating clinicians need to be vigilant and closely monitor 
participants receiving any of these drugs; this includes regular evaluation of ECG and 
electrolytes (including potassium, magnesium, and calcium), particularly in subjects presenting 
with nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Participants will need careful monitoring of the QTcF 
interval. (See section 6.4 for further information.)
5.5.2 IDH Differentiation Syndrome
Subjects treated with ivosidenib (AG-120) have developed signs and symptoms of IDH 
differentiation syndrome.  However, this trial will be in the setting of disease remission, and 
therefore profound differentiation and differentiation syndrome are highly unlikely in this 
setting.  Nevertheless, the clinical features of differentiation syndrome may include some or all 
of the following: unexplained fever, skin rash, hypoxia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], interstitial 
pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and/or pericardial effusion, weight gain, and clinical deterioration. 
Laboratory features may include an increase in ANC and/or platelets. An increase in mature 
leukocytes may be observed in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_57879] a bone marrow biopsy is 
conducted during this time. However, no single sign or symptom may be considered per se as 
diagnostic of the syndrome. If IDH differentiation syndrome is suspected, Investigators need to 
report the suspected diagnosis as an SAE. It is recommended that the prophylactic and 
therapeutic measures indicated below are undertaken at the earliest manifestations of suspected 
IDH differentiation syndrome:
• Temporary hold of AG-120 treatment only if symptoms cannot be medically managed 
with the following:
oPrompt initiation of hydroxyurea at a suggested dose of [ADDRESS_63197]’s clinical condition improves, AG-120 may be reinitiated 
if study treatment was withheld. The dose of AG-120 at re-initiation is to be 
discussed with the Principal Investigator.
5.5.3 Leukocytosis
Ivosidenib/AG-120 may be associated with leukocytosis that can occur without progression of 
AML. It is recommended that the prophylactic and therapeutic measures indicated below be

• Temporary hold of study treatment only if symptoms cannot be medically managed with 
the following:
oPrompt initiation of hydroxyurea at up to a dose of 2000 or 3000 mg PO BID 
oPrompt initiation of leukapheresis, if required 
Treatment with hydroxyurea is allowed after the start of AG-120 for initial control of peripheral 
leukemic blasts in subjects with leukocytosis (for example, WBC >30,000/μL) during the course 
of AG-[ADDRESS_63199]’s clinical condition improves, 
AG-120 may be reinitiated if study treatment was held. If it was held, then the dose of AG-120 at 
reinitiation is to be discussed with the Principal Investigator.
5.6 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Therapy
Participants with persistent remission can continue receiving ivosidenib for 12 cycles. 
Duration of therapy will depend on tolerance and evidence of disease progression. In the absence 
of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for 12 cycles or until one of 
the following criteria applies:
Disease progression
Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment
Unacceptable adverse event(s)
Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the oral 
medication regimen and/or documentation requirements
Participant decides to withdraw from the protocol therapy
General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating investigator
Participants will be removed from protocol therapy when any of these criteria apply.  Alternative 
care options will be discussed with the participant. The reason for removal from protocol 
therapy, and the date the participant was removed, must be documented in the case report form 
(CRF). The DF/HCC research team will update the relevant Off Treatment/Off Study 
information in the CTMS, OnCore.  The Coordinating Center will update this information for 
external site participants.

survival only. Adverse event and toxicity data will not be collected for patients who initiate new 
therapy. Follow-up assessments for study purposes will occur every 3 months per the study 
calendar in Section 10. 
5.8 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study
Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria applies:
• Lost to follow-up
• Withdrawal of consent for data submission
• Death
The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF).  The DF/HCC research team will update the relevant 
Off Treatment/Off Study information in the CTMS, OnCore in accordance with DF/HCC policy 
REGIST-101.  The Coordinating Center will update this information for external site 
participants.
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS
Dose delays and modifications will be made as indicated below. The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.03 will be utilized for dose delays and dose modifications. A copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP website
 http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. 
If a participant experiences several adverse events and there are conflicting dose reduction 
recommendations, the dose should be adjusted to the lowest recommended level. 
Regarding pauses in dosing due to adverse events on study, if and when ivosidenib is held in the 
midst of a cycle, the cycle day will not change, and once the drug is resumed it will be either on 
the day that that cycle has progressed to, or if the pause is beyond [ADDRESS_63201] be clinically stable and

23Systemic therapy ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone is allowed to be used with continuation 
of ivosidenib – i.e. starting 20 mg / day for presumed upper GI GVHD.  In no way is this 
study advocating for the use of a specific dose of steroids for initial therapy of acute 
GVHD, and treatment of such should not be compromised to continue ivosidenib. 
If requiring systemic steroids > 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone, ivosidenib will be held and 
initial therapy for acute GVHD initiated. If within the next 28 days, the participant is able 
to improve and be on a stable dose of steroids which is ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone (or 
equivalent), ivosidenib may be restarted at the original dose. 
Participants are forbidden from receiving any “investigational” agents for the treatment 
of acute GVHD.  Discussion with the overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_57881] “investigational.”  
Patients are allowed to participate on clinical trials investigating initial therapy for acute

If acute GVHD occurs in the dose-escalation cohorts, and this occurs during the first 
cycle of treatment and patient has taken < 14 days of drug, the participant may be 
replaced, as DLT evaluation would be impacted.  
Any initiation of systemic therapy beyond steroids for steroid-refractory acute GVHD 
will result in the participant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_57882]. Systemic therapy beyond steroids for 
participants with steroid-dependent acute GVHD is allowed and will not result in

continue ivosidenib. 
If requiring systemic steroids > 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone, ivosidenib will be held and

however, if exceeding 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent, ivosidenib will be held 
and the patient will have 28 days to restart if symptoms and steroid requirement 
guidelines can be met.
6.3 Non-Hematologic Toxicity (except QT prolongation)
If at any time during ivosidenib dosing, a participant experiences a grade [ADDRESS_63203] cycle (28 days) of dosing, the toxicity will 
be considered to be a DLT (see section 5.4). In participants with known Gilbert’s disease, grade 
[ADDRESS_63204] be held for grade 4 elevated bilirubin and 
resolution/recurrence of toxicity to follow the instructions below in 6.3.[ADDRESS_63205] of a cycle, the cycle day will not change, and once the 
drug is resumed it will be either on the day that that cycle has progressed to, or if the pause is 
beyond 28 days of a cycle, the resumption will be called the day 1 of the subsequent cycle. 
6.3.1 250 mg dosing
If the participant was at the 250mg daily dosing level when the toxicity occurred, and it takes 
longer than 14 days for the event to resolve to ≤ grade 1, then the participant will be taken off 
treatment and will remain on study only for survival and other outcomes.
If the toxicity takes less than 14 days to resolve to ≤ grade 1, then ivosidenib can be restarted at 
250mg daily dosing upon resolution. If the attributable toxicity recurs at ≥ grade 3 (or grade 4 
bilirubinemia in those with known Gilbert’s disease – see above section 6.3) during the course of 
the study, then the participant will come off treatment and will remain on study only for survival 
and other outcomes. If the toxicity recurrence (to ≥ grade 3) happens during the first cycle of 
dosing, then the event will be a DLT. 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-123
Protocol Version Date:  June 11, 2021
CONFIDENTIAL
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.
256.3.2 500 mg dosing
If the participant was at the 500mg daily dosing level when the toxicity occurred, and the toxicity 
resolves to ≤ grade 1 after 14 days, but before 28 days (total) have elapsed, then dosing with 
ivosidenib can resume at the reduced dose of 250 mg daily. If the attributable toxicity recurs at ≥ 
grade 3 (or grade 4 bilirubinemia in those with known Gilbert’s disease – see above section 6.3) 
during the course of the study, then the participant will come off treatment and will remain on 
study only for survival and other outcomes.
If the participant was at the 500mg daily dosing level when the toxicity occurred, and it takes 
less than 14 days for the event to resolve to ≤ grade 1, then dosing with ivosidenib can resume at 
500mg daily. If the toxicity recurs at ≥ grade 3 (or grade 4 bilirubinemia in those with known 
Gilbert’s disease – see above section 6.3), then dosing will again be held. (This will be a DLT if 
it occurs during cycle 1). If the toxicity again resolves to ≤ grade 1 within 28 days, then dosing 
with ivosidenib can resume at the reduced dose of 250mg daily. If the toxicity recurs yet again at 
≥ grade 3 (or grade 4 bilirubinemia in those with known Gilbert’s disease – see above section 
6.3), then the participant will come off treatment and will remain on study only for survival and 
other outcomes. 
A participant who starts at 500mg daily dosing and is subsequently reduced to 250mg daily 
dosing due to toxicity can potentially increase back up to 500mg daily dosing if subsequent 
evaluation of the observed toxicity indicates no relation to study drug. Any such re-escalation 
must have the approval of the principal investigator, [CONTACT_57956]. 
6.4 Concurrent Use of CYP3A4 Inhibitors, CYP3A Inducers, and CYP3A Substrates
Dose adjustment of ivosidenib will be necessary when strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (listed in 
Appendix E) are initiated or used concurrently, given that concomitant administration with 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is predicted to increase ivosidenib steady-state C max by [CONTACT_8622] 52% 
and AUC by [CONTACT_8622] 90%.  For patients at an ivosidenib dose of 500mg daily, concomitant use of 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the ivosidenib dose will be reduced to 250mg daily, with close 
monitoring for any toxicity or QT interval prolongation.
The concomitant use of CYP3A inducers (listed in Appendix E) should be avoided. As for 
concomitant use of CYP3A substrates, this should be avoided when possible, but when this is 
medically necessary, very close monitoring for toxicity is needed.  As an example, tacrolimus 
and sirolimus are both common immunosuppressive medications, and CYP3A substrates, that 
post-transplant participants may be taking.  Both of these agents will be monitored closely in 
terms of trough levels, with levels will be doses closely followed and adjusted. 
6.5 QT Prolongation
Subjects may be at increased risk for the development of QT prolongation when treated with 
ivosidenib in combination with fluoroquinolones, azole antifungal agents, or serotonin (5‐HT3) 
antagonists. Investigators must be vigilant and attempt to avoid administering concomitant 
medications associated with QT prolongation whenever possible, and if no other therapeutic 
options are available, monitor subjects receiving study treatment with the combination of these 
drugs.  They should evaluate ECG and electrolytes (including potassium, magnesium, and 
calcium) at least weekly for the first cycle of therapy.  Vigilance is particularly important in

strong CYP3A4 inhibitor requires careful monitoring of QTcF.
Participants who experience QTcF prolongation to > 480 msec (Grade ≥ 2) while treated with 
ivosidenib should be promptly evaluated for causality of the QTc prolongation and managed 
according to the following guidelines:
• Levels of electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) should be checked and 
supplementation given to correct any values outside the normal range.
• Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57885].
• ECGs should be conducted at least weekly for 2 weeks following QTcF reduction ≤480 
msec.
If no other cause is identified and the investigator believes it is appropriate, particularly if QTc 
remains elevated (after above measures have been implemented, or as determined by [CONTACT_1275]), ivosidenib dosing may be interrupted. An ECG should be rechecked in 
approximately [ADDRESS_63206] observed or more frequently as 
clinically indicated. 
If QTc has recovered or improved and the investigator believes it is safe to do so, re-challenge 
with ivosidenib should be considered if held.
If Grade 2 (QTcF > 480 and ≤ 500 msec), the dose of ivosidenib may be reduced without 
interruption of dosing. The ivosidenib dose may be re-escalated to the prior dose in ≥ 14 days 
after QT prolongation has decreased to ≤ Grade 1.
If Grade 3 (QTcF > 500 msec), when QTc prolongation is first observed, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57886] a cardiologist should both be considered. 
Dosing with ivosidenib will be interrupted. If QTc returns to within 30 ms of baseline or < 450 
msec within 14 days, treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose. The ivosidenib dose cannot 
be re-escalated following dose reduction for Grade 3 QTcF prolongation unless the prolongation 
was associated with an electrolyte abnormality or concomitant medication.
If Grade 4 (QTcF > 500 msec or > 60 msec change from baseline with torsade de pointes or 
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia), subjects should 
be admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57887] a cardiologist. Dosing with ivosidenib should 
be permanently discontinued. If, in the dose-escalation cohorts, this discontinuation occurs 
during the first cycle of treatment, the participant can be replaced, as this would impact DLT 
assessment
6.6 Neurologic Toxicities
According to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB v7 dated March 31 2018), in the single-agent 
studies of ivosidenib, events of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and leukoencephalopathy have 
been observed; these events have been identified as potential risks associated with ivosidenib 
administration, and leukoencephalopathy is a potential risk associated with ivosidenib treatment 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-123
Protocol Version Date:  June 11, [ADDRESS_63207], MRI of the brain, lumbar puncture, and/or biopsy as clinically warranted. . 
Ivosidenib should be permanently discontinued in subjects if these diagnoses are confirmed.
Leukoencephalopathy AEs identified using the search strategy reported during Study AG120-C-
001 included preferred terms of encephalopathy, PML, and PRES. The events of PML and PRES 
were serious; all events were Grade ≥3. No events of leukoencephalopathy were reported in any 
other study of ivosidenib as of 16 January 2018.
A patient with R/R AML receiving 500 mg QD of ivosidenib experienced progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML). The subject withdrew consent from study participation and 
ivosidenib was permanently discontinued. The Investigator and Sponsor assessed the 2 SAEs of 
PML as not related to ivosidenib based on his history of cladribine exposure and his underlying 
disease. PML is a rare opportunistic infection of the central nervous system caused by [CONTACT_57930], which has been observed in patients with AML and in patients with hematologic 
malignancies who were previously treated with purine nucleoside analogs, such as cladribine. 
PML is a very serious condition that may result in severe disability or death. The signs and/or 
symptoms of PML may begin gradually, usually worsen rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], and vary depending on which 
part of the brain is infected. Signs and symptoms may include difficulty with walking and other 
movements, progressive weakness, decline in mental function, visual field deficits, headaches, 
seizures, and speech and language disturbances. 
On this study, subjects should be monitored for onset of signs or symptoms suggestive of PML. 
Diagnostic evaluations may include consultation with a neurologist, MRI of the brain, lumbar 
puncture, and/or brain biopsy as clinically warranted. Ivosidenib should be permanently 
discontinued in subjects with confirmed PML.
An 81-year-old female subject with untreated AML receiving 500 mg QD of ivosidenib 
experienced the SAE of PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) on Study Day 
94. The subject’s symptoms included bilateral upper extremity weakness, hypertension, mild 
frontal to right-sided headache, and seizure activity with bilateral hand twitching and abdominal 
contractions. MRI results of the brain were suspi[INVESTIGATOR_57888]. Ivosidenib was 
permanently discontinued due to the SAE of PRES. The Investigator and Sponsor assessed the 
SAE of PRES as possibly related to ivosidenib. PRES is a rare clinico-radiological neurological 
syndrome. Clinical characteristics may include sub-acute onset of headache, hypertension, 
seizures, altered mental status, visual disturbances, and occasionally other focal neurological 
signs. Radiologically, signs of vasogenic edema are usually seen bilaterally in the white matter of 
the parieto-occipi[INVESTIGATOR_33934], but changes can also be seen in frontal and temporal lobes, brainstem, 
cerebellum, and in cortical as well as deep gray matter. 
On this study, subjects should be monitored for onset of neurological signs and/or symptoms that 
are clinically associated with PRES. Diagnostic evaluations may include consultation with a 
neurologist, MRI of the brain, and other recognized standard of care measures as clinically 
warranted to address and treat any diagnosis of PRES.

Protocol Version Date:  June 11, [ADDRESS_63208] cycle (28 days) of dosing, the toxicity will be considered to be a 
DLT (see section 5.4)
6.7.1 250 mg dosing
If the participant was at the 250mg daily dosing level when the toxicity occurred, and it takes 
longer than 14 days for the event to resolve to ≤ grade 1, then the participant will be taken off 
treatment and will remain on study only for survival and other outcomes.
If the toxicity takes less than 14 days to resolve to ≤ grade 1, then ivosidenib can be restarted at 
250mg daily dosing upon resolution. If the toxicity recurs at grade 4 during the course of the 
study, then the participant will come off treatment and will remain on study only for survival and 
other outcomes. If the toxicity recurrence (to grade 4) happens during the first cycle of dosing, 
then the event will be a DLT. 
6.7.2 500 mg dosing
If the participant was at the 500mg daily dosing level when the toxicity occurred, and the toxicity 
resolves to ≤ grade 1 after 14 days, but before 28 days (total) have elapsed, then dosing with 
ivosidenib can resume at the reduced dose of 250 mg daily. If the toxicity recurs at grade 4 
during the course of the study, then the participant will come off treatment and will remain on 
study only for survival and other outcomes.
If the participant was at the 500mg daily dosing level when the toxicity occurred, and it takes 
less than 14 days for the event to resolve to ≤ grade 1, then dosing with ivosidenib can resume at 
500mg daily. If the toxicity recurs at grade 4, then dosing will again be held. (This will be a DLT 
if it occurs during cycle 1). If the toxicity again resolves to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_63209] who is unable to tolerate 250mg daily dosing of ivosidenib should be discontinued 
from study treatment.

7.2 Definitions
7.2.1 Adverse Event (AE)
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure 
specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study.
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  Regardless of 
severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion need to be 
documented as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a 
part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an
abnormal laboratory result (e.g., record thrombocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).
7.2.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to seriousness.  A serious adverse 
event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening. Life-threatening means that the person was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a 24-hour 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study 
period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease

31existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in 
an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned).
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or
Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:
A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration. However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57893] a complication of therapy administration will be reported as 
an SAE.
Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures
The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
Indication. However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication of 
such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (e.g., surgery, scans, endoscopy, 
sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling). However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57893] a complication of such procedures remains a reportable 
SAE.
Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen
Emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined 
above and not resulting in inpatient admission
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_57894], the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action taken regarding IP, and outcome.
7.2.3 Expectedness
Adverse events can be expected or unexpected.
[IP_ADDRESS] Expected Adverse Event
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered 
expected when it appears in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the 
package insert or is included in the informed consent document as an associated risk. Refer to 
Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated with the study agent(s).

[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected Adverse Event
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected when it varies in 
nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverse event list, the 
Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent 
document as an associated risk.
7.2.4 Attribution
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:
Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment
Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment

8.1 Ivosidenib
8.1.1 Description
Ivosidenib is also known as AG-120 or AGI-[ZIP_CODE]. 
AG-120 demonstrated good oral bioavailability, rapid absorption, and a long t 1⁄2 in subjects with 
IDH1m AML and solid tumors, supporting a QD dosing regimen. Following multiple doses of 
AG-120, steady state was reached within 15 days, with approximately 2-fold accumulation in 
plasma exposure. Plasma exposure of AG-120 increased less than dose proportionally from 100 
to 1200 mg. Results from Studies AG120-C-001 and AG120-C-002 indicate that plasma 2-HG 
levels were substantially reduced in subjects with an IDH1 mutation (achieving levels similar to 
those in healthy volunteers) at dose ranging from 200 to 1200 mg QD. Multiple doses of AG-120 
also decreased 2-HG levels in bone marrow (AML) and tumor biopsies (cholangiocarcinoma, 
chondrosarcoma) at dose ranging from 200 mg to 1200 mg QD. Maximal inhibition of 2-HG in 
plasma did not appear to change upon multiple daily dosing with AG-120.

All samples will be processed in a CLIA certified lab. DNA obtained from blood and bone 
marrow may be subjected to broader sequence analysis (whole exome or genome). 
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) will allow us to look at the clonal architecture of IDH1-
mutant disease at various time points during maintenance after hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant. This will help us look at which clones or subclones respond to therapy and whether 
the disease course is influenced by [CONTACT_57934]-wildtype clones. 
We will also perform next-generation sequencing (NGS) to assess for mutational burden (i.e. the 
fraction of AML cells harboring IDH mutations, corrected for copy number) at various time 
points. We will utilize the SNaPshot genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_57900]. 
This assay uses multiplex polymerase chain reaction technology for single nucleotide variant and 
insertion/deletion detection in genomic DNA. The sequencing targets hotspots and exons 
including IDH1/2.  We will monitor the dynamics of IDH1 mutational burden and assess for the 
presence / absence of the IDH mutant allele at these timepoints. 
9.3 Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)
We will measure MRD from bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_57901]. If bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_57902], peripheral blood should be collected.

I Stage 1-[ADDRESS_63231] disease – see Appendix D. 
The diagnosis of chronic GVHD requires the following: 
Distinction from acute GVHD 
Presence of at least [ADDRESS_63232] 1 
distinctive manifestation confirmed by [CONTACT_57940]. 
Exclusion of other possible diagnoses. 
Scoring of organ manifestations requires careful assessment of signs, symptoms, 
laboratory values, and other study results. A clinical scoring system (0-3) is provided for 
evaluation of the involvement of individual organs and sites. The proposed global 
assessment of severity (mild, moderate, or severe) is derived by [CONTACT_57941]- and 
site-specific scores. 
Overall Scoring (compi[INVESTIGATOR_57908]): 
Mild – involves only 1 or 2 organs or sites (except the lung), with no clinically significant

Moderate – involves (1) at least 1 organ or site with clinically significant but no major 
disability (maximum score of 2 in any affected organ or site) or (2) 3 or more organs or 
sites with no clinically significant functional impairment (maximum score of 1 in all 
affected organs or sites). A lung score of 1 will also be considered moderate cGVHD.
Severe – indicates major disability caused by [CONTACT_57942] (score of 3 in any affected organ or 
site). A lung score of 2 will also be considered severe cGVHD.
11.4 Endpoints
Overall Survival (OS): Overall Survival is defined as the time from first dose of study drug to the 
date of death due to any cause. Participants who are alive at the analysis / cutoff date will be 
censored at the last contact [CONTACT_568].
Relapse-Free Survival (RFS): Relapse-Free Survival is defined as the time from first dose of 
study drug to the earlier of relapse or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease 
progression are censored at the date of last disease evaluation. 
IDH clonal evolution and mutational burden will be explored with descriptive and graphical 
methods. Identification of factors that influence the relationship of mutations with safety and 
efficacy endpoints will be explored, as appropriate.  Summary statistics, including the mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and 25th and 75th percentiles for 2-HG and 
allele burdens will be recorded at each time point. Although exploratory and insufficiently 
powered to detect survival differences, we will attempt to assess the relationships of relapse-free 
survival and overall survival with 2-HG levels and/or IDH mutational burden.

toxicity and accrual data. Information to be provided to the committee may include: up-to-date 
participant accrual; current dose level information; DLT information; all grade [ADDRESS_63233] been reported; summary of all deaths occurring with 30 
days of intervention for Phase I or II protocols; for gene therapy protocols, summary of all deaths 
while being treated and during active follow-up; any response information; audit results, and a 
summary provided by [CONTACT_3476]. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be 
provided upon request. 
12.3 Multicenter Guidelines
This protocol will adhere to the policies and requirements of the DF/HCC Multi-Center Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan. The specific responsibilities of the Overall PI, Coordinating Center, and 
Participating Institutions and the procedures for auditing are presented in Appendix B.
The Overall PI/Coordinating Center is responsible for distributing all IND Action Letters 
or Safety Reports to all participating institutions for submission to their individual IRBs 
for action as required.
Mechanisms will be in place to ensure quality assurance, protocol compliance, and 
adverse event reporting at each site.
Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order the study 
agent(s) directly from supplier.  A participating site may order the agent(s) only after the 
initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded to the Coordinating Center.
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The primary endpoint of this phase I study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose
(RP2D) of ivosidenib in patients with IDH1-mutant myeloid neoplasms after allogeneic
HSCT. Each cohort of patients will be treated starting somewhere between days [ADDRESS_63234]. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), as defined in section 5, will be assessed within the first 
cycle of treatment (1 cycle = 28 days). 
Two doses of ivosidenib will be considered: 250mg daily (dose level 1), and 500mg daily (dose 
level 2). Dose level 2 is the starting dose level. 
A 3+3 design will be used. A cohort of 3 evaluable patients will be treated at each dose level. 
Patients will be considered unevaluable for the determination of RP2D if they never start 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-123

46ivosidenib maintenance therapy, drop out or die within 28 days of starting treatment without 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_57909]. Only patients who start ivosidenib but are 
unevaluable for DLT can be replaced, to ensure 3 or 6 patients are evaluable for DLT per dose 
level. Proportion of patients who consent but never start ivosidenib, and proportion of patients 
who are replaced, will be monitored and reported. All patients who receive any amount of 
ivosidenib will be evaluated for toxicity.
RP2D will be determined according to the rules described in the Table below. 
Number of observed 
DLTs at a Given Dose 
LevelDecision Rule
0/33 additional evaluable patients will be treated at the dose level. 
If <=1 of the 6 treated patients experience a DLT, this is the 
RP2D. If >=2 of the 6 treated patients experience a DLT and 
current dose is dose level 2, de-escalate to dose level 1.
≥2 De-escalate to dose level 1 if current dose is dose level 2. 
1/3Add 3 more patients at current dose level
c) If 0 of these 3 additional patients experience DLT, current 
dose is RP2D.
d) If ≥1 of these 3 additional patients experience DLT, then 
de-escalate to dose level 1 if current dose is dose level 2.
≤1/6 Current dose is the RP2D
*Note:If ≥2/3 or ≥2/6 DLTs are observed at dose level 1 (250mg daily), the trial will be 
discontinued.
Once the RP2D is established, an additional 10 patients will be treated at the RP2D to provide a 
better estimate of the toxicity of ivosidenib. With 16 evaluable patients treated on the RP2D, the 
90% confidence interval of the toxicity rate will be within +/- 22%. The RP2D defined in this 
study will then be used to plan a larger phase II study.
Sample Size
The sample size will range from 6-22 evaluable patients. The expected accrual rate will be 
approximately 1-2 patients / month for this patient population, thus requiring up to 22 months to 
complete the accrual. 
Secondary endpoints
All secondary endpoints will be reported descriptively. This includes median number of days of 
ivosidenib tolerated, cumulative incidence of acute GVHD, cumulative incidence of significant 
chronic GVHD, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall and relapse-free survival. All laboratory 
correlative measurements will also be reported descriptively.

Procedures.       
1.2 Multi-Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan Definitions
DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol:  A research protocol in which one  or more outside 
institutions are collaborating with Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center where  a DF/HCC 
investigator is the sponsor. DF/HCC includes Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care (DF/PCC) 
Network Clinical Trial Affiliates. 
Lead Institution:  One of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center consortium members 
(Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH), Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BCH), Brigham and 
Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH)) responsible for the coordination, development, submission, and 
approval of a protocol as well as its subsequent amendments per the DFCI IRB and 
applicable regulatory guidelines (CTEP, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of 
Biotechnology Activities (OBA) etc.).  The Lead Institution is typi[INVESTIGATOR_57910]/HCC Sponsor. The Lead Institution also typi[INVESTIGATOR_57911]/HCC Multi-Center Protocol.  
DF/HCC Sponsor:  The person sponsoring the submitted Multi-Center protocol who takes 
responsibility for initiation, management and conduct of the protocol at all research 
locations. In applicable protocols, the DF/HCC Sponsor will serve as the single liaison with 
any regulatory agencies. The DF/HCC Sponsor has ultimate authority over the protocol and 
is responsible for the conduct of the study at DF/HCC and all Participating Institutions. In 
most cases the DF/HCC Sponsor is the same person as the DF/HCC Overall Principal 
Investigator; however, both roles can be filled by [CONTACT_57945]. 
Participating Institution:  An institution that is outside the DF/HCC and DF/PCC 
consortium that is collaborating with DF/HCC on a protocol where the sponsor is a DF/HCC 
Investigator.  The Participating Institution acknowledges the DF/HCC Sponsor as having 
the ultimate authority and responsibility for the overall conduct of the study.   
Coordinating Center: The entity that provides administrative support to the DF/HCC 
Sponsor in order that he/she may fulfill the responsibilities outlined in the protocol 
document and DSMP, and as specified in applicable regulatory guidelines. In general, the 
Lead Institution is the Coordinating Center for the DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol.  
DF/HCC Office of Data Quality (ODQ): A group within DF/HCC responsible ensuring

3.3 Informed Consent Requirements
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-123
Protocol Version Date:  June 11, 2021
CONFIDENTIAL
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.
58The DF/HCC approved informed consent document will serve as a template for the 
informed consent for Participating Institutions. The Participating Institution consent form 
must follow the consent template as closely as possible and should adhere to specifications 
outlined in the DF/HCC Guidance Document on Model Consent Language for PI-Initiated 
Multi-Center Protocols.  This document will be provided separately to each Participating 
Institution upon request.
Participating Institutions are to send their version of the informed consent document and 
HIPAA authorization, if a separate document, to the Coordinating Center for review and 
approval prior to submission to their local IRB. The approved consent form must also be 
submitted to the Coordinating Center after approval by [CONTACT_57948].
The Principal Investigator (PI) at each Participating Institution will identify the physician 
members of the study team who will be obtaining consent and signing the consent form for 
therapeutic protocols. Participating institutions must follow the DF/HCC requirement that 
for all interventional drug, biologic, or device research, only attending physicians may 
obtain initial informed consent and any re-consent that requires a full revised informed 
consent form. 
3.[ADDRESS_63239] be on file with the Coordinating Center:
Initial approval letter of the Participating Institution's IRB. 
Copy of the Informed Consent Form(s) approved by [CONTACT_57949]’s 
IRB. 
Participating Institution’s IRB approval for all amendments.
Annual approval letters by [CONTACT_57949]'s IRB.
3.[ADDRESS_63240] (HIPPA). Any 
information, related to the physical or mental health of an individual is called Protected 
Health Information (PHI). HIPAA outlines how and under what circumstances PHI can be 
used or disclosed. 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-123
Protocol Version Date:  June 11, [ADDRESS_63241] sign an authorization statement.  This authorization 
statement may or may not be separate from the informed consent document.  The 
Coordinating Center, with the approval from the DFCI IRB and if applicable NCI/CTEP, 
will provide a consent template, with information regarding authorization for the disclosure 
of protected health information. 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will use all efforts to limit its use of protected health information in 
its trials. However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health information 
must be collected. DF/HCC has chosen to use authorizations, signed by [CONTACT_57950], rather than limited data sets with data use agreements.
3.6.1  DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol Confidentiality
All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the participant are strictly 
confidential. Whenever reasonably feasible, any participant specific reports (i.e. 
Pathology Reports, MRI Reports, Operative Reports, etc.) submitted to the Coordinating 
Center should be de-identified. It is recommended that the assigned DF/HCC QACT case 
number (as described below) be used for all participant specific documents. Participant 
initials may be included or retained for cross verification of identification. 
3.7 DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol Registration Policy
All participants must be centrally registered with DF/HCC prior to conducting any research-
related procedures and start of protocol treatment.
3.7.1  Participant Registration and Randomization 
Please refer to protocol Section 4.0: Registration Procedures
3.7.[ADDRESS_63242] be registered with the DF/HCC CTMS before the initiation of treatment 
or other protocol-specific interventions. Treatment and other protocol-specific 
interventions may not be initiated until the Participating Institution receives confirmation 
of the participant’s registration from the Coordinating Center. The DF/HCC Sponsor and 
DFCI IRB must be notified of any violations to this policy.
3.7.3  Eligibility Exceptions
CTEP specifically prohibits registration of a participant on any NCI Sponsored protocol 
that does not fully and completely meet all eligibility requirements. No exceptions to the 
eligibility requirements for a protocol without DFCI IRB approval will be permitted. All 
Participating Institutions are required to fully comply with this requirement. The process 
for requesting an eligibility exception is defined below.
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-123
Protocol Version Date:  June 11, 2021
CONFIDENTIAL
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.
603.8 DF/HCC Protocol Case Number
At the time of registration, the following identifiers are required for all subjects: initials, 
date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity. Once eligibility has been established and the 
participant successfully registered, the participant is assigned a unique protocol case 
number.  Participating Institutions should submit all de-identified subsequent 
communication and documents to the Coordinating Center, using this case number to 
identify the subject.    
3.8.1 Protocol Deviations, Exceptions and Violations
Federal Regulations require an IRB to review proposed changes in a research activity to 
ensure that researchers do not initiate changes in approved research without IRB review 
and approval, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the 
participant. DF/HCC requires all departures from the defined procedures set forth in the 
IRB approved protocol to be reported to the DF/HCC Sponsor, who in turn is responsible 
for reporting to the DFCI IRB.
For reporting purposes, DF/HCC uses the terms “violation”, “deviation” and “exception” 
to describe departures from a protocol. All Participating Institutions must adhere to these 
requirements for reporting to the DF/HCC Sponsor and will follow their institutional 
policy for reporting to their local IRB.
3.8.2  Definitions
Protocol Deviation: Any departure from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB-
approved protocol which is prospectively approved prior to its implementation.
Protocol Exception:  Any protocol deviation that relates to the eligibility criteria, e.g.
enrollment of a participant who does not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Protocol Violation: Any protocol departure that was not prospectively approved by [CONTACT_57951]. 
3.8.3  Reporting Procedures
DF/HCC Sponsor: is responsible for ensuring that clear documentation is available in the 
medical record and/or regulatory documents to describe all protocol exceptions, 
deviations and violations. The DF/HCC Sponsor will also be responsible for ensuring 
that all protocol violations/deviations are promptly reported per DFCI IRB guidelines. 
Participating Institutions: Protocol deviations require prospective approval from the 
DFCI IRB. The Participating Institution must submit the deviation request to the 
Coordinating Center who will then submit the deviation request to the DFCI IRB. Upon 
DFCI IRB approval the deviation is submitted to the Participating Institution IRB, per 
institutional policy. A copy of the Participating Institution’s IRB report and 
determination will be forwarded to the Coordinating Center within 10 business days after 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-123
Protocol Version Date:  June 11, [ADDRESS_63243] be sent to the Coordinating Center in a timely manner. The 
Coordinating Center will provide training for the requirements for the reporting of 
violations. 
Coordinating Center:  Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from the 
Participating Institution, the Coordinating Center will submit the report to the DF/HCC 
Sponsor for review. Subsequently, the Participating Institution’s IRB violation/deviation 
report will be submitted to the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reporting guidelines. 
DF/HCC will forward all violation reports to CTEP via an internal DF/HCC process, as 
applicable.
3.9 Safety Assessments and Toxicity Monitoring
The study teams at all participating institutions are responsible for protecting the safety, 
rights and well-being of study participants. Recording and reporting of adverse events that 
occur during the course of a study help ensure the continuing safety of study participants. 
All participants receiving investigational agents and/or other protocol mandated therapy 
will be evaluated for safety. The safety parameters include all laboratory tests and 
hematological abnormalities, physical examination findings, and spontaneous reports of 
adverse events reported by [CONTACT_4317].  All toxicities encountered during the study will 
be evaluated according to the NCI criteria specified in the protocol. Life-threatening 
toxicities must be reported immediately to the DF/HCC Sponsor via the Coordinating 
Center. Protocols using CTEP supplied agents must report these toxicities via the Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Program Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP-AERS). The 
DF/HCC Sponsor will be notified of these events via CTEP-AERS.
Additional safety assessments and toxicity monitoring will be outlined in the protocol.
3.9.1 Guidelines for Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Guidelines for reporting Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are 
detailed in protocol Section 7: Adverse Events.
Participating Institutions must report the SAEs to the DF/HCC Sponsor and the 
Coordinating Center following the DFCI IRB Adverse Event Reporting Policy. 
The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of all Participating Institution 
Adverse Event reports and be responsible for communicating to all participating 
investigators, any observations reportable under the DFCI IRB Reporting Requirements.  
Participating Institutions will review and submit to their IRB according to their 
institutional policies and procedures
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-123
Protocol Version Date:  June 11, 2021
CONFIDENTIAL
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.
623.9.2 Guidelines for Processing IND Safety Reports 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all IND Safety Reports and ensure that all IND 
Safety Reports are distributed to the Participating Institutions. Participating Institutions 
will review /submit to their IRB according to their institutional policies and procedures.
3.10 Data Management
DF/HCC CTRIO develops case report forms (CRF/eCRFs), for use with the protocol.  These 
forms are designed to collect data for each study. DF/HCC CTRIO provides a web based 
training for all eCRF users.
  
3.10.1    Data Forms Review
Data submissions are monitored for timeliness and completeness of submission. If study 
forms are received with missing or questionable data, the submitting institution will 
receive a written or electronic query from the DF/HCC Office of Data Quality, 
Coordinating Center, or designee. 
Responses to all queries should be completed and submitted within 14 calendar days.  
Responses may be returned on the written query or on an amended paper case report 
form, or in the case of electronic queries, within the electronic data capture (eDC) system. 
In the case of a written query for data submitted on a paper case report form, the query 
must be attached to the specific data being re-submitted in response.  
If study forms are not submitted on schedule, the Participating Institution will 
periodically receive a Missing Form Report from the Coordinating Center noting the 
missing forms. 
4. REQUISITIONING INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG
The ordering of investigational agent is specified in the protocol Section 8: Pharmaceutical 
Information. 
Participating Institutions should order their own agent regardless of the supplier. (i.e., NCI 
or a pharmaceutical company.)  
If the agent is commercially available, check with the local Director of Pharmacy and/or the 
Research Pharmacy to ensure that the agent is in stock. If the agent is not stocked, ensure 
that the agent can be ordered once the protocol is approved by [CONTACT_1036]. 
If the agent is investigational, ensure that the pharmacy will be able to receive and store the 
agent according to state and federal requirements. The local IRB should be kept informed of 
who will supply the agent (i.e., NCI or a pharmaceutical company) so that any regulatory 
responsibilities can be met in a timely fashion.

635. MONITORING: QUALITY CONTROL
The quality control process for a clinical trial requires verification of protocol compliance 
and data accuracy. The Coordinating Center, with the aid of the DF/HCC Office of Data 
Quality, provides quality control oversight for the protocol.
5.1 Ongoing Monitoring of Protocol Compliance
The Coordinating Center will implement ongoing monitoring activities to ensure that 
Participating Institutions are complying with regulatory and protocol requirements, data 
quality, and participant safety. Monitoring practices may include but are not limited to 
source data verification, and review and analysis of eligibility requirements, informed 
consent procedures, adverse events and all associated documentation, review of study drug 
administration/treatment, regulatory files, protocol departures reporting, pharmacy records, 
response assessments, and data management. 
Participating Institutions will be required to submit participant source documents to the 
Coordinating Center for eligibility confirmation as well as for ongoing, remote monitoring. 
Participating Institution are also subject to on-site monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_43898]. 
Participating Institutions will undergo on-site monitoring by [CONTACT_57952] 
[ADDRESS_63244] patient; Combination on-site and remote monitoring will 
occur every 4-[ADDRESS_63245] redacted 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_57912]’ medical record and source documents to the Coordinating Center to 
aid in source data verification.  The participants and CRFs to be reviewed at the visit will 
be communicated at least 2 weeks in advance of the scheduled monitoring visit.  Source 
documentation can be provided to the Coordinating Center via an encrypted memory stick 
or via a secure file transfer system.  During remote monitoring visits, the Site Specific File 
will be reviewed in lieu of the site regulatory binder.
On-Site Monitoring will be scheduled several weeks in advance and will be conducted over 
a 2-3 day period.  During an on-site monitoring visit, 2-4 participants will be monitored as 
well as the complete regulatory binder. Source documentation verification (SDV) will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_57953]’ complete medical record and source documents.  
Participating Institutions will be expected to coordinate the necessary resources for the 
monitor, including a desk, access to all participant medical and research records (electronic 
and hard copy), the regulatory binders and access to a photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_3694].  The Participating 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-123
Protocol Version Date:  June 11, [ADDRESS_63246] completed treatment, teleconferences 
will be scheduled as needed.
5.2 Monitoring Reports
Following each monitoring visit, a monitoring follow-up report will be provided to the 
Participating Site (i.e. Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_57913]).  The monitoring report will summarize any 
issued queries or data clarification requests, identify any reportable events or required 
follow-up on prior events and will specify details of any non-compliance.  Participating 
Sites are requested to respond to all queries and data clarifications requests within 10 
business days.
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all monitoring reports to ensure protocol compliance. 
The DF/HCC Sponsor may increase the monitoring activities at Participating Institutions 
that are unable to comply with the protocol, DF/HCC Sponsor requirements or federal and 
local regulations.
5.3 Accrual Monitoring
Prior to extending a protocol to an external site, the DF/HCC Sponsor will establish 
accrual requirements for each participating institution. Accrual will be monitored for each 
participating institution by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Sponsor or designee. Sites that are not meeting 
their accrual expectations may be subject to termination.
The minimum accrual per participating site is [ADDRESS_63247] and effort of overseeing each site. 
6. AUDITING: QUALITY ASSURANCE
Auditing is a method of Quality Assurance and involves the systematic and independent 
examination of all trial related activities and documents.  Audits determine if evaluated 
activities were appropriately conducted and whether data was generated, recorded and 
analyzed, and accurately reported per the protocol, applicable Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs), and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
6.1 Audit Plan: NCI Sponsored Trials
N/A
6.2 DF/HCC Internal Audits
 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-123
Protocol Version Date:  June 11, [ADDRESS_63248] to audit by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Office of Data Quality 
(ODQ). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], approximately 3-[ADDRESS_63249] participant safety or the integrity of the study are found, 
more participant records may be audited. 
6.3 Audit Notifications
It is the Participating Institution’s responsibility to notify the Coordinating Center of all 
scheduled audit dates (internal or NCI) and re-audit dates (if applicable), which involve this 
protocol. All institutions will forward a copy of final audit and/or re-audit reports and 
corrective action plans (if applicable) to the Coordinating Center, within 12 weeks after the 
audit date. 
6.4 Audit Reports 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all final audit reports and corrective action plans, if 
applicable. The Coordinating Center must forward any reports to the DF/HCC ODQ per 
DF/HCC policy for review by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Audit Committee. For unacceptable audits, the 
DF/HCC Audit Committee would forward the final audit report and corrective action plan 
to the DFCI IRB as applicable.
6.5 Participating Institution Performance
The DF/HCC Sponsor, DFCI IRB and the NCI for CTEP trials, is charged with considering 
the totality of an institution’s performance in considering institutional participation in the 
protocol. Participating Institutions that fail to meet the performance goals of accrual, 
submission of timely and accurate data, adherence to protocol requirements, and compliance 
with state and federal regulations, may be recommended for a six-month probation period. 
Such institutions must respond with a corrective action plan and must demonstrate during

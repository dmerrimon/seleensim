 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA 
 
We propose  a placebo  controlled randomized study on the use of mannitol as an agent to 
protect against the effects of transient renal ischemia and its impact on  renal function during 
the surgical proced ure of partial neph rectomy. Patients unde rgoing partial neph rectomy for 
the treatment of kidney tumors will be rando mized 1:1 to receive either intravenous  mannitol 
or saline during their procedu re, ad ministered prior to renal vascu lar clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Changes in 
renal function following surgery will be monitored using calculated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) and  renal scan data obtained pre- and post-operatively, as part of routine standa rd of 
care. 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS 
 
Primary endpo ints: 
 
• Difference in eGFR at 6  months after surgery. 
Seconda ry endpo ints: 
• Difference in eGFR at 6  weeks after su rgery. 
• Difference in radionuc lear scintigraphy  renal scan  at 6 months postoperatively. 
• Difference in rate of grade 3-5 complications within 30 days of surgery. 
• Difference in estimated blood loss. 
• Difference in ischemia time. 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE 
 
The improved renal function outcomes that occ ur with neph ron sparing surgery in patients 
with renal tumors amenable to partial nep hrectomy has prompted a considerable increase  in 
the number of partial ne phrectomies performed for patients with small renal masses. 
Nationally, this trend has been  notable, co mprising less than 5% of cases in 1988, 15%  of 
procedu res by 2002  and roughly 25% of kidney  surgery by 2008. Surgeons at Memorial 
Sloan Kettering have led the field in partial nep hrectomy procedu res consistently, publishing 
the initial pape rs describing the techn ique and now performing neph ron sparing surgery in 
95% of patients surgically treated for small renal masses  and over 80% for larger tumors ( 4 - 
7 cm) in contemporary experience .1, [ADDRESS_1284088] would be 
evenly distributed in both arms of a randomized trial des ign which evaluates the factors that 
can be controlled. Our study aims to assess  the significance  of mannitol infusion prior to 
renal ischemia in partial neph rectomy in a randomized prospec tive manner.

 Mannitol ‘s purported effects of increasing renal blood flow, decreasing intravascu lar cellular 
swelling, and increasing intravascular volume have been  used  as rationale for its use to 
ameliorate the damage to renal tissue caused by [CONTACT_913858].[ADDRESS_1284089] be 
detrimental to kidney function.5 
 
Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic with a number of physiologic effects on the kidney  as studied 
in preclinical models. Zager et al. sho wed that mannitol increases  renal b lood flow (RBF) in 
rats compared to sham controls (2 fold) when rats were given an intravenous  bolus after [ADDRESS_1284090] of mannitol7 and/or release  of 
atrial na triuretic peptide.8 Physiologically, increased renal b lood flow by [CONTACT_913859]9, 10 and increase  intravascu lar 
volume with an associated decrease  in hematocrit11. Intratubular casts may be flushed  out by 
[CONTACT_913860][INVESTIGATOR_007].12 
Mannitol may also play a role in mitochon drial protection after ischemia. Schrier et al 
demonstrated in a dog renal ischemia model that mannitol preserved renal cortical 
mitochon drial function.13 
 
There has been  suggestion, however, that mannitol‘s effects may not be  entirely beneficial 
and the respo nse of increased  renal b lood flow a reflection, or cause, of severe hypoxic 
injury. As described by [CONTACT_913861], the vascular anatomy of the human kidney  is 
remarkable for the magnitude of the relative difference  in arteriovenous  oxygen tension 
between the cortex and the medulla, creating a region of hypoxia within the outer medulla that 
is sens itive to ischemia and metabolic changes.5 The cortex receives 94% of renal b lood flow 
whereas the medulla only receives 6%, with the portion of the outer medulla receiving its 
vascu lar supp ly as venous  blood from the inner medulla. Because  of this, the partial pressure 
of oxygen in the medulla is normally around  10 mm Hg versus 50 mm Hg in the cortex. The 
medulla, therefore, exists in a state of relative hypo xia, even in the presence of adequate 
RBF, and the prime region of risk during states of ischemia. The thick ascending limb of 
Henle’s loop is espec ially vulnerable to hypoxic injury.[ADDRESS_1284091] been  performed to assess  the use of mannitol in 
reduc ing the incidence  of renal failure in patients unde rgoing abdo minal aortic aneurysm 
(AAA) repair for infrarenal ao rtic aneu rysms.15 There were no significant differences  between

 with the exception of one study (Wijnen et al) which identified evidence  of improved 
outcomes in the mannitol treated cases  on post operative day 2 (p=0.047). 16-[ADDRESS_1284092]’s have since  demonstrated mannitol is not 
only ineffective in regard to renal p rotection, but also has potential for producing renal failure. 
21, [ADDRESS_1284093] a rguments for the use of mannitol as a renal p rotective agent come from the 
transp lant literature, although this model and  the results of these  studies may involve 
mechan isms dissimilar to those  of partial neph rectomy patients. Collins and Green et al 
performed some of the early studies of unilateral normothermic renal ischemia in a rabbit 
model u tilizing 1 hour of renal vascular occlusion 25 The right kidney  served as an internal 
control for the clamped left kidney. Renal function was assessed  immediately after 
unclampi[INVESTIGATOR_913843] (within 1 hour) and 
chronically (up to 7 days). Mannitol conferred a significant benefit in both the acute and 
chronic measu rements. The same investigators further characterized the timing and dose  of 
mannitol in a subsequent study, and found  that 0 .25 mg/kg of IV mannitol given [ADDRESS_1284094] benefit at d ay 3. 26 Shilliday 
and Allison provide a summary of the animal models suppo rting mannitol ‘s beneficial role 
but conclude the “case for mannitol must remain, in the words of the Scottish legal verdict, 
‘Not proven’”.[ADDRESS_1284095] dosing during partial neph rectomy procedures as part of routine practice.25 The 
origin of this dosing level is uncertain and the use of mannitol during surgery remains up to 
the surgeon’s discretion. In a preliminary study, as yet unpub lished,  investigators at MSKCC 
performed a retrospe ctive evaluation of the renal function outcomes in patients undergoing 
minimally invasive partial neph rectomy, segregating the cohort by [CONTACT_913862] (standard 
dosing regimen) during the proced ure. In total, [ADDRESS_1284096] better preoperative eGFR (median 68 vs 61 ml/min/1.73m2), were more likely to 
unde rgo ischemia (98% vs 88%)  and had fewer comorbidities (42% vs 53% had an ASA 
score of 3 or 4) than those who did not receive mannitol.

Overall renal function appears to transiently decrease  following neph ron sparing surgery in a 
manner which suggests delayed recovery. As demonstrated in Figure 1, the profile of renal 
function, as  assessed  by [CONTACT_67889], appe ars comparable for pa tients managed with and without 
mannitol based  on retrospective data. Overall, the recovery of renal function was very similar 
in both groups  (p=0.[ADDRESS_1284097] of mannitol from GEE model). The predicted eGFR for a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_913844] 2 months after surgery was 62 ml/min/1.73m2 both for those given and not 
given mannitol; at 6  months the respe ctive predicted GFR measurements were 63 and 64 
ml/min/1.73m2. It is notable that the mannitol group had a lower nadir and recovery of eGFR 
than the group who did not receive mannitol. In evaluating the open  surgical experience  in 
over 850 open  partial procedu res 34 did not receive mannitol, many of who did not require 
renal ischemia, limiting our evaluation of this cohort.

The clinical significance of [ADDRESS_1284098]- 
operative eGFR was not felt clinically important. We further evaluated our retrospective 
dataset of 281 patients identifying an index pa tient as 60  yo, non-African American man with 
preope rative base line eGFR of 65 cc/min/1.73m2. Using the CKD Epi [INVESTIGATOR_913845], this would 
correlate  to  a  serum  creatinine  of  1.2  mg/dL.  For  every  0.1  mg/dL  chan ge  in  serum 
creatinine, up or down from this baseline, there would be a roughly consistent 6 unit change 
in  eGFR.  Finally,  we  noted  that  a  6  unit  decrease  from  the  median  value  of  65 
cc/min/1.73m2 would place a patient below the thresho ld of stage 3 chronic kidney  disease 
which is clinically meaningful. For these  reasons we felt that detecting a difference  in 6 units 
of eGFR b etween the groups  was an appropriate level at which to power the study.

each  patient’s postoperative eGFR compared to the preoperative base line can then be used 
to compare the treatment and placebo  arms of the trial.

 In summary, the practice of intravenous  mannitol use during partial nep hrectomy procedu res 
as a renal p rotective agent has not been  appropriately investigated to prove its effectiveness. 
Our preliminary retrospective data suggests mannitol does  not demonstrate a benefit in 
attenuating the effects of ischemia or in the recovery of renal function following partial 
neph rectomy. We propose a rando mized prospective study to evaluate its use for this 
purpose.  
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY  DESIGN/INT ERVENTION  
 
4.1 Design 
 
This study is a prospective rando mized doub le blind placebo  controlled trial comparing renal 
function outcomes in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy for renal tumors. Patients will 
be randomized in 1:1 fashion to receive mannitol or saline provided intravenous ly within 30 
minutes prior to renal vascular clampi[INVESTIGATOR_913846]. 
 
Patient rando mization will be accomplished by [CONTACT_913866] (CRDB ) once 
eligible patients have been  consen ted and registered in the Protocol Participant Registration 
system.  Pharmacy will be able to access the requisite information on the CRD B to ensure 
correct delivery of either mannitol or saline to the treatment or placebo  arms respe ctively. 
The anes thesiologist, surgeon and patient will be blinded  to the intervention. 
 
To avoid any compromise in the blinding process, mannitol input into CASIS will be deferred 
until after the trial has  finished.  At this time it will be entered into CASIS by [CONTACT_913867].

6 months. The O’Brien-Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_913847].  The significance  levels for 
the interim and  final analyses are 0.0031  and 0.049, respec itively. 
 
4.2 Intervention 
 
In patients unde rgoing partial neph rectomy, fluid management will be uniform and 
standa rdized for all operative techn iques (open, laparoscop ic or robot as sisted) using the 
fluid management guidelines recommended  by [CONTACT_913868]. Upon arrival to the operating room patients will be placed  supi[INVESTIGATOR_913848]. Before induc tion of general anes thesia, IV hydration may be provided 
by [CONTACT_913869]  [ADDRESS_1284100] hydration parameters for patients 
unde rgoing both open  and laparoscop ic surgical procedu res28. After induction of general 
anes thesia Normosol or Lactated Ringers, at a target infusion rate of 10cc/kg (+/- 1cc/kg), 
will be administered over the first hour of surgery.  After the first hour of surgery IV fluid will 
be administered at 6cc/kg (+/- 1cc/kg) intended  to maintain a minimum s ystolic blood 
pressure of 90-100mmHg and a minimum urine output of 0.5cc/kg/hour.

• Baseline radionuc lear scintigraphy  renal scan within 6 months of surgery 
• Routine history and physical examination to include docu mentation of any 
comorbidities, medications (including complementary and alternative medications), 
family history, social history (alcohol and  tobacco  usage), height, body  weight, 
Karnofsky performance  status within 30 days of surgery 
• Abdominal and  pelvic CT scan and/or renal ul trasound  within 3 months of surgery 
• Chest X-ray or Chest CT scan within 3 months of surgery 
• Preope rative laboratory investigations: CBC, basic chemistry pane l, urinalysis 
(dipstick, microalbumin, creatinine, microscopic evaluation if indicated), urine culture if 
indicated within 30 days of surgery 
• Baseline creatinine values will be converted to eGFR us ing the CKD-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908].

proportion of kidney  tissue preserved during surgery. 
 
The techn ique of surgery (open, laparoscopic, robot assisted laparoscopic) will be at the 
discretion of the surgeon and patient. None of the techn iques utilized in the study are 
cons idered experimental and  all are cons idered standa rd therapeu tic options for a patient 
with a renal mass amenable to partial nep hrectomy. Since patients will be rando mized as

intraope rative vital sign monitoring. This will include blood pressure, 4-lead ECG, hea rt rate, 
pulse oximetry, temperature and urine output. Intravenous  fluid use during surgery will be 
provided by [CONTACT_913873]. Total volume of fluids provided 
as well as estimated blood loss will be recorded. 
 
Mannitol solution of 12.5 gm in 200 cc of saline or placebo  will be available in the OR at the 
time of surgery initiation. It will be administered intravenous ly and will be completely infused 
within 30 minutes prior to renal artery clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. During the surgery, vascular occlusion will 
be provided using vascular bulldog or Satinsky clamp of the renal artery. If multiple primary 
renal vessels are encou ntered, selective occlusion of the vesse ls can be provided at the 
surgeon’s discretion and the details regarding number of arterial vesse ls and number of 
clamped vesse ls recorded. Clampi[INVESTIGATOR_913853]-clampi[INVESTIGATOR_913854].

This protocol does  not require any additional e valuations after the patient is admitted for 
surgery other than those routinely part of clinical ca re for a patient undergoing a partial 
neph rectomy. These  will include: 
• ASA classification, assigned  by [CONTACT_101034] 
• Deep venous  thrombosis prophylaxis per standardized pathway

 • Type of anesthesia: general, epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], combination 
• Duration of anesthesia and of surgery 
• Duration of warm or co ld ischemia time 
• Estimated blood loss 
• Use of intraoperative fluids (crystalloid, colloid, blood products) 
• Postoperative day [ADDRESS_1284108]. 
• Follow up visit serum c reatinine measurements (6 weeks +/- 4 weeks and 6 months 
+/- 2 months) 
• 6 month +/- [ADDRESS_1284109] unde rgone a partial 
neph rectomy. 
• Patients may be concurrently enrolled on protocol 89-076 for co llection of tissue and 
blood for tissue banking. 
 
11.0 TOXICITI ES/SIDE EFFECTS 
 
There are minimal side effects to the use of mannitol in the dosages prescribed for this study. 
The AHFS warnings/ precautions relate to excess amounts (>100 g of intravenous  mannitol 
in a 24 hour period).29 12.5 g of mannitol is considered the “test dose” in adult popu lations 
when mannitol is used  for other therapeu tic effects. Nonetheless, conc erns related to 
adverse effects listed are: 
 
• Fluid/electrolyte loss: e xcess mannitol infusion can lead to profound  diuresis with fluid 
and electrolyte loss; close medical sup ervision is required 
o The anes thesia and PACU teams routinely monitor urine output, vitals and 
volume status and therefore this concern is minimal. 
• Nephrotoxicity: may cause renal d ysfunction especially in high doses therefore 
caution is required in patients taking nephrotoxic agents or have pre-existing renal 
disease  
o Patients are excluded  from participating if their eGFR identifies them as 
having  pre-existing Stage 3b or greater chronic kidney disease.  All 
neph rotoxic agents are closely monitored/discontinued  routinely in all partial 
neph rectomy patients. 
o Severe clinical co mplications from mannitol use in the literature are 
exceed ingly rare and only follow massive doses  of mannitol, in the range of 
400-900 g/day.30 
 
 
• Cardiovascular: may lead to chest pain, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, 
dyspnea  due to congestive heart failure or overload 
• espi[INVESTIGATOR_696]: Pulmonary edema 
• Central Nervous System: Pyrexia, headache,  confusion, vertigo 
• Dermatological: Urticaria 
• Gastrointestinal: Nause a, emesis, xerostomia 
 
Surgical complications will be assessed  prospe ctively and retrospec tively reviewed using the 
institutional standa rd for complications reporting for all surgical patients as followed by [CONTACT_913874]. Standa rdized graded  complications and adverse events at MSKCC 
utilize the five point modified Clavien system. Grade I include complications requiring

 monitoring but no  intervention, Grade II requires bedside or medical treatment; grade III 
cons titutes adverse events require surgical or procedu ral intervention with return to normal 
functioning; grade IV includes  disabling, life-threatening complications with resulting 
functional loss and grade V is the death of the patient. This is a modification of the Clavien 
system for reporting complications with defined, categorized, and classified events that will 
be segregated into time periods of </= 30 days, 31 - 90 days and > 90 days after su rgery and 
includes  medication related complications following NCI CTCAE version 3 guidelines.31 
 
12.0 CRIT ERIA FOR TH ERAPEUTIC R ESPONSE/OUTCO ME ASSES SMENT 
 
As an intent-to-treat study, patients will be evaluated for the primary endpo int if they are 
registered on study, brought to the operating room for su rgery, and begin anes thesia for the 
procedu re. Becau se the role of mannitol as  a protective agent in regard to kidney  function is 
not entirely clear and its mechan ism of action may be mediated through its effects on the 
contralateral kidney, all patients will be evaluated for the primary endpo int even if the 
ipsilateral kidney  is not clamped during the procedure. If the surgery is aborted for any 
reason  before attempted excision of the mass or if intravenous  infusion fails for any reason 
the patient will be dropped from the study and replaced.  Based  on past experience  these 
issues  are rare events. 
 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be estimated according to the CKD-EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_14420]. 
 
Perioperative complications are defined as any complication graded  in the MSKCC grading 
system occurring during the intraope rative and postoperative period up to 30 days. 
 
Immediate perioperative morbidity is defined as any complication graded  in the MSKCC 
grading system occ urring during the initial hosp ital stay. 
 
The intraoperative period is defined as the period from anesthesia induction to final skin 
closure. 
 
The postoperative period is defined as the period from final skin closure to the study endpo int 
at 6 months +/- [ADDRESS_1284110].

13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they express a desire to do so, if it is determined 
to be in the patient’s best interest to do so, or if they do not undergo initiation of their surgical 
procedu re as stipulated in section 12.0. Patients who are not evaluable for the study primary

14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
14.1 Primary Aim 
 
The primary aim is to establish the difference in eGFR 6  months after su rgery between the 
mannitol group and the placebo  group. The difference  will be assessed  with an ANCOVA 
model with eGFR 6  months after su rgery (+/- 2 months) as  the outcome and treatment group, 
surgical techn ique, and preope rative eGFR as  covariates. We will report a two-tailed p-value 
and a 95% confidence  interval for the difference  between groups. If a patient does  not ha ve 
an eGFR measurement between 5-[ADDRESS_1284111] a mean eGFR of 60 
cc/min/1.73m2 [ADDRESS_1284112] the minimal 
clinical significant difference of 6 units of eGFR, a trial with 90% power and 5% alpha 
requires [ADDRESS_1284113] to enroll 8 patients per month to reach accrual in 2 
years.

 14.2 Secondary  Aims 
 
An ANCOVA model will be used  to compare the difference  in eGFR b etween treatment 
groups  at 6 weeks (+/- 4 weeks) after surgery with postoperative eGFR as the outcome, and 
treatment group, s urgical techn ique, and  preoperative eGFR as  covariates. 
 
We will also use the ANCOVA on the absolute level of eGFR b ecause  this has the greatest 
statistical po wer. However, the estimate produc ed by [CONTACT_314855] – a mean difference  in eGFR 
levels – is of incomplete clinical interpretability. We will therefore present estimates in two 
other ways for the purposes of illustrating the results in clinical terms. We will first give 
percentage change separately by [CONTACT_19313], a long with a difference  between groups.  We will 
also report the percentage of patients in each  treatment group that ha ve postoperative eGFR 
less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, as this is generally considered to represent a clinical level of 
kidney  dysfunction. 
 
ANCOVA will be used  to compare 6 month (+/- 2 months) postoperative radionuc lear 
scintigraphy  renal scan  with treatment group, baseline postoperative radionuc lear 
scintigraphy  renal sca n, and  randomization stratum as covariates.  ANCOV A will also be 
used  to compare estimated blood loss and ischemia time with treatment group and 
rando mization stratum as covariates. 
 
Multivariable logistic regression will be used  to assess the difference in the rate of grade 3-5 
complications between treatment groups. The multivariable model will include treatment 
group and randomization stratum as covariates. 
 
We will report a two-tailed p-value and a 95% confidence  interval for the difference  between 
groups  for all seconda ry outcomes.  Summary statistics will be calculated by [CONTACT_913878], 
sex, race, BMI, serum hemoglobin, serum a lbumin, ASA, and  Karnofsky Performance  Scale. 
 
15.0 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURE S 
 
15.1 Research  Participant Registration 
Confirm eligibility as defined in the section entitled Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligibility. 
Obtain informed consent, by [CONTACT_166995]. 
 
During the registration process  registering individuals will be required to complete a protocol 
spec ific Eligibility Checklist. 
 
All participants must be registered through the Protocol Participant Registration (PPR) Office 
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. PPR is available Monday through Friday from 
8:30am – 5:30pm at [PHONE_214]. Registrations must be submitted via the PPR Electronic 
Registration System (http://ppr/). The completed signature [CONTACT_167000]/RA or 
verbal sc ript/RA, a completed Eligibility Checklist and other relevant documents must be 
uploaded  via the PPR Electronic Registration System.

 15.2 Random ization 
 
Rando mization will be accomplished  by [CONTACT_30579], and patients 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_913879] (<60 v. >=60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and surgical techn ique 
(open  versus minimally invasive).  This ensu res adequate numbers of patients above and 
below the K/DOQI chronic kidney  disease  classification (i.e. <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) in the final 
study patient popu lation. Also, we do not be lieve that surgical app roach  plays a role in the 
putative mechan ism of action. To control for any  such effects, randomization of cases  will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_913880]. Since this is a double blind study, 
the patients’ treatment assignments can be viewed in the CRD B only by [CONTACT_913881]. 
 
After eligibility is established  and immediately after conse nt is obtained, patients will be 
registered in the Protocol Participant Registration (PPR) system and randomized using the 
Clinical Resea rch Database (CRDB ), by [CONTACT_454127] [PHONE_214] 
between the hours of 8:30 am and  5:30 pm, Monday  - Friday. 
 
16.0 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
 
A Resea rch Study Assistant (RSA) will be assigned to the study who will provide 15% of data 
management suppo rt. The respons ibilities of the RSA include project compliance,  data 
collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, regulatory monitoring, problem resolution 
and prioritization, and coordination of the protocol study team ac tivities. The data collected 
for this study will be entered into a secure depa rtmental databas e. A minimal da ta set will be 
added  to CRDB . 
 
16.1 Quality Assurance  
 
Monthly registration reports will be gene rated to monitor pa tient accrual and 
completeness  of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess 
missing data and incons istencies. Accrual rates, and extent and accuracy of evaluations 
will be monitored throughout the study period. Potential problems will be brought to the 
attention of the study team for discuss ion and action. 
 
 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by [CONTACT_30589] 2001.  The plans address the 
new policies set forth by [CONTACT_30590] “Policy of the National Cancer 
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html. The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established and are monitored by [CONTACT_166996]. The MSKCC Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plans can be found  on the MSKCC Intranet a t: 
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm. 
 
There are several different mechan isms by [CONTACT_30592], safety 
and quality. There are institutional processes  in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol 
monitoring, compliance  and data verification audits, therapeutic respons e, and  staff 
educa tion on clinical research QA) and  departmental proced ures for quality control, plus

 clinical trials programs. The  committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for 
Phase  I and  II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase  III 
clinical trials, report to the Center’s Resea rch Council and  Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol de velopment and  review process, each protocol will be assessed  for its 
level of risk, and  degree of monitoring required. Each type of protocol (e.g. NIH spo nsored, 
in-house  spons ored, indus trial spons ored, NCI coope rative group, etc) will be addressed  and 
the monitoring procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation. 
 
17.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Benefits and risks: The experimental intervention (mannitol) is preferentially omitted by 
[CONTACT_913882]. A 
previous study has sugges ted there is no benefit and there are theoretical arguments that it 
may do harm. Therefore we do not believe that the therapeu tic aspec ts of this trial pose  any 
risks different from those  faced for patients unde rgoing a partial neph rectomy off-study. 
 
Toxicities/side effects: Adverse outcomes have not been  assoc iated with the doses  of 
mannitol be ing used  in the protocol. 
 
Alterna tives/options for treatment: The alternative to participation in the trial would be to 
unde rgo a partial neph rectomy according to the surgeon’s standa rd practice rather than be 
rando mized. No other a spect of patient ca re would differ. 
 
Financ ial costs/burdens: The subjects will not be compensated for their participation and 
there are no costs involved in participation. 
 
Privacy and confidentiality: Every effort will be made to keep the study records private. No 
identifiers will be used  in any reports or pub lications resulting from the study, however, the 
data will be used  in the interests of ongoing research. 
 
Voluntary nature of the study: Participation is entirely voluntary. All aspec ts of patient’s 
care and monitoring will be unaffected by [CONTACT_913883]. 
 
17.1 Privacy 
 
MSKCC’ s Privacy Office may allow the use and disclosure of protected health information 
pursuant to a completed and signed Research Authorization form. The use and disclosure of 
protected health information will be limited to the individuals described in the Research 
Authorization form. A Resea rch Authorization form must be completed by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_166975] (IRB/PB). 
 
17.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Repor ting 
Any SAE must be  reported to the IRB/PB as soon as possible but no  later than 5 calendar 
days. The IRB/PB requires a Clinical Resea rch Database  (CRDB ) SAE report be submitted 
electronically to the SAE Office at  [EMAIL_203]. The report shou ld contain the following

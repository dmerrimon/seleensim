the study product.
This definition includes:
events related to the investigational product or the reference product
events related to the procedures involved
7.2.2 Definition of a serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that:
led to death,
led to serious deterioration in the health of the su bject, that either resulted in
a life -threateningIIillness or injury, or
a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, or
in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83782], or
medical or surgical intervention to prevent life- threatening illness or injury or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function,
led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect
An AE does not need to be recorded as a SAE if it only represents a relapse or an expected change or 
progression of the condition that was the cause of the treatment, without the development of new 
symptoms and signs.
In cases of doubt, whether an AE fulfils a serious criterion or not, there should bea predisposition to 
report as a SAE rather than not report as such (see Section 7.2.5 ).
IFor users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to the investigational product.
IIThe term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk ofdeath atthetime
oftheevent; itdoes notrefer toanevent which hypothetic allymight have caused death if itwere more severe. (Source: ICH -
E2A clinical safety data management: definitions and standards forexpedited reporting).
IIIPlanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_10396], without serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered a SAE. (Source: ISO14155:2011).
7.2.[ADDRESS_91340] with an AE occurring after enrollment through study exit should be fully recorded in the 
source document(s) for further transcription to the eCRF.  Each subject should be questioned about AEs 
at each study visit following study entry. The question asked should be: “Since your last clinical visit 
have you had any health problems?” Information on AEs can also be obtained from signs and sympt oms

from the subjects or their relatives.
Exceptions from AE reporting are normal fluctuations in pre -existing diseases. However, pre-existing 
illnesses that deteriorates (in intensity or frequency) shall be reported as AEs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Intensity
Intensity will be recorded for each reported AE. The following definitions of intensity are to be used:
Mild: Awareness of symptoms or signs, but easily tolerated (acceptable )
Moderate: Enough discomfort to interfere with usual activity (disturbing)
Severe: Incapacity to work or to do usual activity (unacceptable)

treatment procedure and ongoing at study end, shall be followed- up after the subject's participation in 
the study is over. Such events shall be followed -up after the last study visit until resolved, assessed as

Page 29of 379Data Handling and Management
9.1 Data management
Data management based on GCP refers to the activities def ined to achieve safe routines to enter clinical 
data information into a database, efficiently and avoiding errors. The data management routine includes 
procedures for handling eCRFs database set -upand management, data entry and verification, data 
validati on, and documentation of the performed activities including information of discrepancies in the 
process. The data management process will be described in detail in the data management plan (DMP).
The database, the data entry screens and program will be des igned in accordance with the CIP and the 
eCRF. Data validation will be performed by [CONTACT_83791]. Drugs and 
events will be coded in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) Drug and medical 
dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) dictionaries asspecified in the DMP. SAEs in the clinical 
database will be reconciled against the data in the safety database.
When all efforts have been made to ensure that the data recorded in the eCRFs and entered in the 
database is as correct and complete as possible, the clinical database will be locked. Study data will be 
transferred to SAS datasets, which thereafter will be write- protected. Statistical analyses will be 
generated in SAS using data from the locked datasets.

i.e. the name [CONTACT_83808]. The 
Investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct. If some assessment s 
are not done, or if certain information is not available, not applicable or unknown, the Investigator shall 
indicate this in the eCRF. The Investigator shall electronically sign off the study data. By [CONTACT_2960], the 
Investigator takes responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and legibility of the data reported to the 
Sponsor in the eCRF.
9.2.2 The query process

The Investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents. These shall be made av ailable for 
inspection by [CONTACT_83798]. The Investigator must submit a completed eCRF for 
each subject for whom signed informed consent has been collected.
All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], shall be 
clearly identified with the CTN and subject number. Any personal information, including name, shall be 
removed or rendered illegible to preserve individual confidentiality.

writing.
The Sponsor shall verify that each subject has consented in writing to direct access to the original 
medical record/source data (by [CONTACT_83800]). The 
data recorded in the eCRFs will be checked for consistency with the source documents/medical record 
by [CONTACT_83801] (source data verification; SDV). In order to be able to perform SDV, 
information about each subject’s participation in the study has to be detailed in the medical record.

The Institution and Investigator arejointly responsible for providing sufficient information to all 
subjects to enable them to give their informed consent not only to the participation in the investigation, 
but also to theprocessing of Personal Data. Such information includes information regarding the 
purposes of the processing, the length of time during which Personal Data will be stored, the right of
access to stored Personal Data and the right to correction or purgin g of incorrect or obsolete Personal

A subject who withdraws his  or  her  consent  to  the  processing  of  Personal  Data must be considered 
to have withdrawn from the investigation but the data collected until the consent was withdrawn may be 
used in the statistical analyses.
Authorized representatives from the Sponsor or a RA may visit the investigational site to perform 
audits/inspections, including source data verification, i.e., compari ng data in the subjects’ medical 
records and the eCRF. Data and information will be handled with strict confidentiality.
The study shall include collection and processing of personal data as specified in the Regulation (EU) 
2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) on the protection of individuals with regard to

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 6 of 89 Methodology:  
Study EP-262-[ADDRESS_421098] eligibility 
that includes collection of daily PP -NRS scores; a 6-w eek Double-Blind Trea tment Period; and a 
4-week Follow-Up Period after administration of the last dose of study drug for a total study duration 
of up to approximately [ADDRESS_421099] . Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized  in a 
2:1 ratio to receive either a 150 mg dose of EP262 or placebo orally (PO), once daily (QD) during the 
6-week Double-Blind Tre atment Period.  
EP-262-202 Study Design 
 
PO = oral; QD = once daily.  
a Any subject who completes the Double -Blind Treatment Period or discontinues study drug (EP262 or placebo) 
early will have a Follow -Up Visit approxi mately 4 weeks (±3  days) after the last dose of study drug.  
Screening Period 
The Screening Period will consist of one visit (Visit 1). During this period, subjects will undergo assessments to determine study eligibility per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Visit [ADDRESS_421100] be completed between Day -30 and Day -7 (inclusive) to 
allow for collection of a baseline average PP -NRS score. Subjects are to use a protocol -permitted , 
non-urea-containing emollient on lesional and nonlesional skin daily for at least 1 week before Day 1 
and agree to continue using that same emollient daily at the same frequency (ideally once or twice 
daily) throughout the study . Subjects will record emollient use in a  daily diary  throughout the study. 
Double-Blind Treatment Period  
The Double-Blind Tr eatment Period will consist of 3 study visits (Visits 2, 3, and 4 [Day 1, Week 3, 
and Week 6]). During this period, all subjects who meet eligibility requirements will be enrolled into the study and will be randomized  on Visit 2 (Day 1), in a 2:1 ratio, to receive double-blind, PO , QD 
150 mg doses of EP262 or placebo for 6 weeks. Randomization will be conducted centrally via an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). QD PO dosing of study drug should occur after at least a 
[ADDRESS_421101] dose of study drug will be administered at the clinical site on Visit 2 (Day 1) 
after all basel ine study procedures are completed. Visit 2 (Day 1) will not have a visit window; all 
other visits in the Double -Blind Treatment Perio d will have a visit window of ±3 days. Subjects who Enroll/Randomize

Whenever possible, subjects should remain in the study and complete the remaining study visits and 
assessments even when study drug has been discontinued. Subjects who discontinue study drug for any 
reason and continue with the study visits as planned thro ugh Visit 4  (Week 6) (participating only in PD 
and safety, but not PK measures) will participate in the Follow- Up Visit if the last dose of study drug 
was administered less than 4 weeks before Visit 4 (Week 6) to ensure that at least [ADDRESS_421113] dose of study drug, and a Follow- Up Visit 
approximately 4 weeks (±3  days) after the last dose of study drug if at least [ADDRESS_421114] to ensure that he/she is in satisfactory 
health. All contacts and contact [CONTACT_155806]’s medical record.  
Rescue Medications 
New concomitant medications and procedures for treatment of AD  are prohibited during the study. If a 
patient requires treatment with a new medication or procedure due to intolerable AD symptoms, study 
drug should be discontinued. Whenever possible, subjects should remain in the study and complete the 
remaining study visits and assessments even when study drug has been discontinued.  
Safety Assessments
 
Safety evaluations, including adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, medical history, vital 
signs, physical examinations, standard 12- lead ECGs, and laboratory evaluations of safety will be 
performed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessmen ts (Appendix A ).  
Adverse Event Collection  
AEs will be documented from the signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) until the end of study participation.  
Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Skin swabs, skin sample collection via skin tape strip s, skin biopsies ,  
 and photographs of 
AD lesions and sites for skin swabs, skin tape strips application , and biops ies will be performed as 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix A ). It is preferred that the skin swab, tape strips, 
and biopsies (if applicable) come from the same lesion, if lesion size permits, or from a similar lesion 
in the same anatomical area.  
Examples  of the patient -reported assessments are provided in the appendices but are not to be 
distributed to subjects for completion. Subjects will be trained on completion of all patient -reported 
assessments using a study- issued electronic device or application (app).  
Skin Swabs 
A cotton swab will be passed along the lesional skin of the area of worst involvement at Screening. 
The skin swab will be placed in aerobic culture and analyzed for the presence of Staphylococcus 
aureus  (S. aureus ). At Visits 2, 3, and 4 (Day 1, Week 3, and Week 6), skin swabs will be collected 

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page [ADDRESS_421115] samples from 
the stratum corneum for  proteomic assessment. Skin tape strips will be applied to AD lesional skin on 
Visits 2, 3, and 4 ( Day 1 , Week 3, and Week 6, same location, even if the lesion has cleared), and at a 
nonlesional site at Visit 2 (Day 1).  
Skin Punch Biopsies  
Two 4.0- mm skin biopsies will be collected on Visit 2 (Day 1), one from lesional skin and one from 
nonlesional skin in the vicinity of the lesional skin, and one 4.0- mm skin biopsy will be collected on 
Visit 4 ( Week 6) from the same lesional skin , at least [ADDRESS_421116] of EP262 on the gene expression signature [CONTACT_340362] 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_207891], immune cell infiltration, markers of epi[INVESTIGATOR_340306])  will be evaluated  
via histology, immunohistochemistry , and transcriptomics. The location of the biops ies will be

Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 23 of 89 5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Role of the MRGPRX2 Receptor in the Pathogenesis of Atopic 
Dermatitis 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by 
[CONTACT_340327], eczematous dermatitis, and chronic itch (Magnifico 2020, Yu 2021) . 
Skin thickening, lichenification of the skin from chronic scratching, erythema, and acute lesions may develop over time (Correale 1999 ). Disease symptoms are often exacerbated by [CONTACT_340328], including bacterial colonization on the skin, various environmental stimuli including heat 
and sweating, as well as exposure to aeroallergens such as house dust mites (HDM s). In addition 
to these external factors, impaired epi[INVESTIGATOR_340309], including genetic mutations in filaggrin, decreased filaggrin expression, and dysregulation of the immune system leading to cellular infiltrates including 
dendritic cells, type 2 T helper cells (Th2), and eosinophils in the skin. The prevalence of AD in adults has been estimated to be 7% to 10% in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) and 4.4% to 7.1% in Europe 
(Eckert 2019, Hadi 2021) . 
The mas -related G  protein-coupled receptor ( MRGPR ) family is comprised of 8 human Class A 
rhodopsin- like G -protein coupled receptors (MRGPRX1-X4 and D-G) that can sense noxious 
stimuli and appear to have a role in innate immunity. MRGPRX2 is predominantly expressed in mast cells and has been shown to induce degranulation upon binding to a wide variety of agonists ( Subramanian 2016, Corbiere 2021) . MRGPRX2 has been shown to mediate 
immunoglobulin E ( IgE)-independent activation of mast cells, including degranulation and 
regulation of inflammatory processes. Activation of MRGPRX2 triggers release of proinflammatory mediators and a multicellular signaling cascade that likely plays a key role in 
multiple human diseases involving clinically relevant mast cell activation  (Babina 2020, 
Thapaliya 2021), including AD. 
Mast cells and MRGPRX2 have been implicated in the pathophysiology of AD in both clinical 
and preclinical studies. A significant association has been observed between the number of mast 
cells in AD skin lesions and the disease severity (assessed by [CONTACT_340329] [EASI] score) ( Simon 2004) . Increased expression of the MRGPRX2 agonist substance P, 
as well as MRGPRX2, has been reported in itchy AD patient skin versus non-itchy skin samples  
(Nattkemper 2018, Youngblood 2020) . In addition to substance P, MRGPRX2 is also activated 
by [CONTACT_340330], including major basic protein and eosinophil cationic 
protein fragments. Elevated levels of these peptides in serum of patients with AD have been 
reported and are correlated to severity of disease ( Kapp 1991, Morita 1995, Ogasawara 2020 , 
Deeks 2021) . An attenuated phenotype has been shown in Mrgprb2 knockout mice (the murine 
homolog of MGRPRX2) i n a preclinical model of AD induced by [CONTACT_340331] -toxin, an 
MRGPRX2 agonist released by [CONTACT_271697]  (S. aureus ), and HDM extract  including a 
reduction in Th2 cytokines, improved epi[INVESTIGATOR_57831], improved clinical scores, and reduced 
local skin inflammation ( Serhan 2019) . This reduction of phenotype in Mrgprb2 knockout mice 
was also observed in other models of dermatitis ( Green 2019, Meixiong 2019, Corbiere 2021) . 
Collectively, these findings point to a key role of MRGPRX2 in mediating IgE -independent mast 
cell activation  and skin inflammation, mak ing this receptor a promising novel target for AD as

Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page [ADDRESS_421130] of the human MRGPRX2 receptor under 
development as an orally ( PO) administered therapy for AD and chronic spontaneous urticaria.  
Results from Study EP- 262-101, a first- in-human randomized, Phase [ADDRESS_421131] provided 
information on the safety, tolerability , and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of EP262. Study EP-262-[ADDRESS_421132] evaluation. Thirty healthy subjects received a single 50, 150, 400, 800, or 1200 mg dose of EP262. Eighteen  subjects received 50, 150, or 300 mg as a 
multiple dose regimen  over 7 days. 
All doses evaluated were well tolerated with no dose- limiting  adverse events ( AEs), early 
terminations due to AEs, moderate or severe AEs, or serious AEs (SAEs) reported  with EP262. 
No adverse trends in safety laboratory measures, vital signs, or electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 
parameter s have been observed . EP262 concentrations increased with increasing single doses in 
an approximately linear manner and modeling of single dose data predicted multiple dose concentrations.  
 
 
 
 
 
E
P262 was evaluated in MRGPRX2 knock-in mice expressing the human receptor in a 
translational model of AD induced by [CONTACT_340332] S. aureus  
Enterotoxin Type B (SEB). In initial experiments, daily PO administration of EP262 
significantly attenuated the development of AD relative to vehicle controls as measured by [CONTACT_340333], tissue measurements, and histopathology following exposure to HDM/SEB ( Wollam 
2023) . As a proof-of-concept study, Study EP-262-202 aims to confirm these findings in human 
disease, focusing on mechanistic measures and objective assessments of early changes in lesional AD skin. Study EP -262-202 will evaluate the safety, tolerability , and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
EP262 over 6 weeks of treatment in subjects with AD. The 6 -week treatment duration is 
supported by [CONTACT_941] 6-week GLP toxicology program and deemed sufficient to demonstrate changes in PD measures and to provide trends in efficacy based  on the anticipated rapid onset of action of 
EP262 to directly block activation of MRGPRX2. 
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EP262 in patients with AD, 
which will be measured by [CONTACT_24975], frequency, and severity of treatment- emergent AEs ( TEAEs ), 
and change from baseline in vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory parameters. In addition to 
evaluations of safety and tolerability, changes in differentially expressed genes from biopsies of 
lesional skin relative to nonlesional skin will be assessed before and after treatment. The effect of EP262 on AD skin lesions will also be assessed via histology, including examinations of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_207891], immune cell infiltration, and markers of epi[INVESTIGATOR_340310]. Notably, early transcriptomic and histologic changes in lesional skin have been 

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 25 of 89 demonstrated to correspond with improvements in clinical scores (Hamilton 2014, Bissonnette 
2019, Pavel 2019) , potentially serving as initial indicators of treatment response.  
Disease severity will be evaluated  
 Although the 
study is not powered to detect significant changes in these clinical scores versus placebo, they 
are included to assess trends in improvement and enable analyses of the correlation between transcriptomic and clinical changes . Additionally, pruritus, disease control, and quality of life 
will be evaluated through the  
. Other exploratory 
analyses include  
 
  
The study will be randomized to ensure random allocation of subjects to treatment arms and 
reduce bias. Because several of the PD  assessments have a high degree of subjectivity, the study 
will be double-blinded. In addition, a placebo-controlled design will be used to control for 
confounding factors, such as potential Investigator bias, and to ensure that the statistical procedures can be appropriately applied.

5.4.4. Ov
erall Benefit:Risk Conclusion  
Overall, the clinical and  nonclinical experience to date with EP262 suggests minimal risk to 
subjects participating in Study EP-262-202. Importantly, there is a clear unmet need for novel 
treatment options for AD . The first -line therapeutic approach for management of AD includes a 
combination of emollients, antibiotics, anti-pruritic, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_900]- inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
(Sahni 2022) . Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_340311], injectable monoclonal antibodies  that block receptor 
binding of interleukin ( IL)-4 and/or IL-13 (reducing Th2 response), ha ve been approved for the 
treatment of moderate -to-severe AD as second -line therapy (Tameez Ud Din 2020, Blair 2022) . 
Oral j anus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (abrocitinib and upadacitinib) hav e recently been approved 
for treatment of  AD, but ha ve several serious side effects and are indicated as third -line therapy 
only (in adults with refractory, moderate- to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately 
controlled with other systemic drug products, including biologics, or when use of those therapi[INVESTIGATOR_340312]-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 28 of 89 is inadvisable) ( Mikhaylov 2023) . I f determined to be effective, EP262 may ultimately have the 
potential to offer a much -needed additional treatment option for patients with  AD.

• Withdrawal of consent 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Termination of the study by [CONTACT_340334] a regulatory agency or an 
IRB or IEC  (Section  7.6) 
• Other  
A subject may elect to discontinue study participation at any time for any reason without 
prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_8018]. If a subject withdraws 
consent, no further evaluation should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 37 of 89 consent. The Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to document the specific reason why 
consent was withdrawn.  
9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
9.1. Treatment Assignment  
Approximately 30 subjects with AD will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_421155]’s compliance with dosing of study drug by [CONTACT_340337]’s dosing diary  as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix A ).  
If the Investigator has concerns about a subject’s dosing compliance, the Investigator should discuss this with the subject, assess the reasons for noncompliance and the likelihood that the 
subject will remain noncompliant, and notify the Sponsor accordingly. 
9.3. Randomization and Blinding  
9.3.1. Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either a 150 mg dose of EP262 or placebo PO, QD for 6 weeks during the Double- Blind  Treatment Period beginning at Visit 2 (Day 1). 
Randomization will be conducted centrally via an IWRS. The master randomization list will be kept secured until the study blind is broken at the end of study. 
Subjects who withdraw for any reason without completing all screening evaluations successfully 
will be considered “screening failures”. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to 
ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, and to respond to queries from 
regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any SAEs.  
9.3.2. Blinding  
The Sponsor, Medical Monitor, Contract Research Organization (CRO) staff, Investigators, site 
staff, and subjects will be blinded to subject’s assigned treatment until the database is locked 
except for CRO or vendor staff involved in the analysis of PK samples. Procedures for emergency unblinding and unblinding for regulatory reporting are described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] 
and Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Emergency Unblinding  
If an emergency unblinding during the Double- Blind Treat ment Period is required, the subject’s 
treatment assignment may be unblinded through IWRS by [CONTACT_737]. If a treatment assignment is unblinded, the subject will be discontinued from randomized treatment.

10.1. Study Drug  
Capsules containing [ADDRESS_421161] will take 2 capsules per d ose, with subjects randomized to EP262 
receiving  a total of 150 mg per day. 

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 43 of 89 10.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
Study drug will be packaged into bottles with child -resistant caps , induction sealed, labeled with 
a unique number, and supplied to clinical sites in a blinded manner. 
10.3. Study Drug Storage  
The study drug capsules  should be stored at controlled room temperature, 15°C to 25°C (59 °F to 
77°F), with excursions up to 30°C (86°F). 
10.4. Study Drug Administration  
Each study drug dose is to be administered PO as intact capsules (swallowed whole, not split, 
opened, or chewed) and taken with approximately 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water  on an empty 
stomach . Subjects will be instructed to take the study drug at approximately the same time of the 
day after a fast of at least [ADDRESS_421162] dose of study drug will be administered at the clinical site on Visit 2 (Day 1) after all baseline study procedures are completed.  
10.4.1. Instructions for Missed Dose(s)  
Subjects should be instructed that if they forget to take a dose, they can take the dose within 8 hours of the normal dosing time; otherwise, they should take their next dose at the regular time on the following day. If the subject vomits the capsules, he/she should be instructed not to take 
additional capsules on the same day but to take the next dose at the regular time on the following 
day. Subjects should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_340339] [ADDRESS_421163] to retrieve any remaining study drug that has not been returned. 
10.6. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
Study drug will be sent to the clinical  site under appropriate storage conditions. Upon receipt of 
study drug, site  staff are to open the shipment, and verify that the amount and identity of the 
contents match that stated in the enclosed shippi[INVESTIGATOR_52861]. The Sponsor (or designee) is to be notified immediately about any irregularities, discrepancies, or damage. 
Study drug will be provided for use only in this study and is not to be used for any other purpose. 
The site  staff will maintain a full record of study drug accountability as described in 
Section  10.5.  
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 44 of 89 Upon completion of the study, used and unused study drug and study drug bottles are to be 
returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or, if prior Sponsor approval is obtained, disposed of in 
accordance with applicable site procedures. Site  staff must maintain documentation of any 
missing or unreturned study drug. The final disposition of all study drug received at the site is to be documented. 
10.7. Product Quality Complaints  
A product quality complaint (PQC) is defined as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a product defect or deficiency related to manufacturing, labeling, or packaging (ie, any dissatisfaction relative to the identity, 
quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product, including its 
labeling or package integrity). A PQC may have an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protection  of subjects.
 
All initial PQCs must be reported to the Sponsor or CRO by [CONTACT_2085] -site personnel within 
[ADDRESS_421164] 12-lead ECGs, and laboratory evaluations of safety will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix A ). 
11.1. Adverse Events  
11.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including a cli nically 
significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal (investigational) product.  
Medical conditions present at baseline that worsen in severity or frequency after exposure to study drug are considered TEAEs. A TEAE is any condition that was not present prior to treatment with the study drug but appeared following treatment, was present at treatment 
initiation but worsened during treatment, or was present at treatment initiation but resolved and 
then reappeared while the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensity of the AE when the treatment was initiated). Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340315] a disease that existed before administration of study drug, and for which the condition 
has not worsened since starting study drug, are not to be considered TEAEs/treatment- emergent 
SAEs. Events with emergency room visits that are less than 24 hours will also not be considered SAEs unless they meet one of the criteria listed in Section  11.2.1. 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 45 of 89 Clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG assessments, or vital sign results 
may constitute an AE if they meet one of the criteria listed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. However, 
whenever possible, the underlying diagnosis should be listed in lieu of associated abnormal 
results. Abnormalities deemed not clinically significant by [CONTACT_340340] A Es. 
11.1.2. Determining Severity of Adverse Events  
AEs must be graded for severity (ie, intensity) using CTCAE, version 5.0 ( HHS 2017) . A 
severity category of mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death, as defined in Appendix B , 
must be entered on the AE eCRF. The criteria below are to  be used for determining the severity 
of AEs where there is no actual CTCAE  term for the specific reported AE found in the CTCAE, 
version 5.0 guideline ( Appendix B ). It should be noted that the term “severe” used to grade 
intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious”. The assessment of severity is made regardless of the relationship to study drug or of the seriousness of the AE. When reporting AEs, reference should be made to the CTCAE manual for guidance on appropriate grading.  
Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living 
(eg, preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money). 
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling, limiting selfcare activities of daily life (eg, bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, not bedridden). 
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5: Death related to AE.  
11.1.3. Determining Causality of Adverse Events  
Causality refers to the relationship of the event to the study drug (EP262 or placebo) . The 
Investigator will assess the causality of the event according to the following criteria: 
• Not related – A reaction for which sufficient data exist to indicate that the etiology is 
unrelated to the study drug. 
• Related  – A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
study drug, which may or may not reasonably have been produced by a number of 
other factors including underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatments; and/or that could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_340341], complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent 
treatments; and/or disappears or d ecreases on cessation or reduction in study drug 
dose; and/or reappears or worsens when the study drug is administered. 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page [ADDRESS_421165] be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRFs provided by [CONTACT_340342] ( ICF) until the end of study participation. AE s 
will be assessed for likelihood of causal relationship to the study drug (EP262 or placebo) and 
severity.  
The new onset of signs, symptoms, or other findings that occur before signing of the ICF will be 
captured as medical history (Section  11.3).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Special Instructions for Recording Adverse Events in the eCRF  
Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
If a diagnosis is known at the time of reporting, this should be recorded in the eCRF rather than the individual signs and symptoms (eg, record only hepatitis rather than elevated transaminases, bilirubin, and jaundice). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded as an SAE or AE on the eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up and should replace the individual signs and/or symptoms as the event term on the eCRF, unless the signs/symptoms are clinically significant. 
Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, A Es occurring secondary to other events (eg, clinical sequelae or a cascade of events) 
should be identified by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if severe vomiting is known to result in 
dehydration, it is sufficient to record only vomiting as an SAE or AE on the eCRF. However, medically significant A Es occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time 
should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF. For example, if severe vomiting leads to acute renal failure, both events should be recorded on the eCRF. 
Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject evaluation 
timepoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the eCRF. If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in severity, it should be recorded as a new AE on the eCRF.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation timepoints, and 
subsequently recurs. Each reoccurrence of an AE should be recorded on the eCRF. 
Abnormal Laboratory Values or Vital Signs 
Protocol defined laboratory values and vital signs will be reported as AEs if the abnormal 
laboratory or vital sign result: 
• Requires an adjustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment;  
• Requires additional testing, excluding repeat testing of the lab in question, or surgical intervention;  
• Is associated with accompanying signs/symptoms that are not considered part of a preexisting diagnosis or syndrome; or 
• Is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_340343]-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page [ADDRESS_421166] of the study, the signs/symptoms or 
diagnosis should be reported as an AE (or if appropriate, an SAE) only i f clinically significant, 
and the associated laboratory value or vital sign should be considered additional information that must be collected on the relevant eCRF.  
11.2. Serious Adverse Events  
11.2.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, that at any dose:  
• Results in death; 
• Is life -threatening, ie, the subject is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred, (it does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death);  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_179367]. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340316] a disease that existed before administration of 
study drug, and for which the condition has not worsened since starting study drug, 
are not to be considered SAEs. Emergency room visits that are less than 24 hours will also not be considered SAEs unless any of the other serious criteria is fulfilled; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
• Is a medically significant event that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Note: A distinction should be drawn between SAEs and severe AE s. Severity is a measure of the 
intensity of an AE, while the criteria for seriousness are indications of adverse subject outcomes 
for regulatory reporting purposes. A severe AE is not necessarily considered an SAE. For 
example, a headache that persists fo r several hours may be considered a severe AE but not an 
SAE. Conversely, a wound infection that may be considered minor could be an SAE if it prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
11.2.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator and the Sponsor will monitor safety for this study. A Serious Adverse Event 
Report (SAER) Form is to be completed for each SAE occurring after signing of the ICF until [ADDRESS_421167] be reported within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s knowledge of the 
event  to . If requested  by [CONTACT_1034], any supporting 
documentation (eg, medical records) sent to  with the 
SAER Form must have subject identifying information (eg, subject names, subject addresses, 
medical records number) redacted by [CONTACT_779]. Follow-up information to all SAEs should be submitted to the Sponsor, or designee, in the same timeframe as initial reports.  

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 48 of 89 All SAEs will be followed until resolution or medical stabilization (in cases where resolution 
would not be expected). 
In accordance with applicable regulations and local laws, the Sponsor or designee will report all 
serious and unexpected AEs assessed as related to study drug by [CONTACT_11219]/or Sponsor, 
to the regulatory authorities within the required timeframe. The Investigator will be responsible 
for reporting this safety information to his or her IRB/IEC.  
If the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE any time after study completion and determines it is 
related to the study drug, the SAE must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours 
of the Investigator’s knowledge of the SAE. 
11.2.3. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy in and of itself is not an AE, although pregnancies occurring in subjects or partners of 
male subjects are considered immediately reportable events. If a pregnancy occurs in a subject, 
study drug must be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy must be reported to  Drug Safety via email at  within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy using the Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
The Investigator will follow the pregnant woman until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify the Sponsor, or designee, of the outcome within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge 
of the pregnancy outcome. The Investigator will provide this information on the Pregnancy 
Reporting Form. This notification includes pregnancies resulting in live, “normal” births. 
If the pregnant subject experiences an SAE during pregnancy, or the outcome of the pregnancy 
meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, spontaneous abortion [any 
congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs 
(ie, report the event to the Sponsor via email at  
within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event). 
All neonatal deaths and congenital anomalies that occur within 30 days of birth (regardless of 
causality) should be reported as SAEs to the Sponsor or designee. In addition, any infant death or 
congenital anomaly occurring after study completion that the Investigator suspects is related to the in -utero  exposure to the study drug should also be reported to the Sponsor or designee. 
11.3. Medical History  
The Investigator or designee will collect and review the subject’s medical history , including AD

followed by [CONTACT_94525] [ADDRESS_421171] >3× ULN or total bilirubin >2× ULN, subjects should be 
closely monitored as defined below to determine whether the abnormalities are improving or worsening:  
• Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests [ADDRESS_421172] is asymptomatic.  
• Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  
• Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets.  

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 51 of 89 • Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic 
hepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease.  
• Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
• Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (eg, INR, direct bilirubin).  
If close observation is not possible, study drug should be interrupted until further investigation can be performed.  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) is identified and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline values. 
The Investigator and Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor must discuss and agree with any 
decision to rechallenge. Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalities is considered possibly drug-induced. 
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if the following abnormality or group of 
abnormalities occur:  
• ALT or AST >8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN AND total bilirubin >2 × ULN OR  INR >1.5

prior to the first dose of study drug as baseline. All data collected will be included in subject data listings.  
A formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before database lock. Additional statistical analysis details will be included in the SAP.  

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 55 of 89 15.1. Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets  will be considered: 
• Full Analysis Set : All subjects who are randomized and take at least 1 dose of 
randomized study drug will be included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS). Subjects in 
the FAS will be analyzed according to randomized treatment assignment. All PD 
analyses will be based on the FAS.  
• Per Protocol  Set: The Per Protocol (PP) Set is a subset of the FAS  containing 
subjects who meet study eligibility requirements  and had no protocol deviations that 
might impact the assessment of PD measurements. Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment assignment. The PP Set will be used for sensitivity analyses relating to PD. The type of protocol deviations governing 
exclusion from the PP Set will be determined prior to database lock and will be 
detailed in the SAP.  
• Safety Analysis Set: All subjects who are randomized and take at least 1 dose of randomized study drug will be included in the Safety Analysis Set. Safety analyses will be based upon treatment actually received.  
• PK Set : All subjects who  receive at least [ADDRESS_421176] and will be summarized for the Safety Analysis Set using summary statistics by [CONTACT_6654]. 
Duration of treatment will also be summarized.  
15.6. Safety Analysis 
The Safety Analysis Set will be used for the summaries of the safety data. Safety data will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_6654].  
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 56 of 89 The safety and tolerability of EP262 will be assessed by [CONTACT_340345], causality, and 
severity of AEs as well as treatment discontinuations due to AEs. AEs will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) by [CONTACT_340346] P referred T erm. AEs that 
begin after the first administration of study drug, or existing AEs that worsen after the first dose 
of study drug, are considered treatment emergent. All AE summaries will include TEAEs, and all 
AEs will be presented in data listings. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary and summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_340347] (ATC) class using 
counts and percentages.  Medications started prior to the first dose of study drug will be indicated 
in the data listings. Use of protocol- permitted emollient will also be summarized descriptively.  
Changes in vital signs, standard 12-lead ECGs, and laboratory evaluations will be summarized descriptively.  
15.7. Pharmacodynamic Analysis  
PD analyses will be based on the FAS. Select  secondary and exploratory PD endpoint analyses 
may also be repeated in the PP Set , if sufficiently different to the FAS,  as supportive analyses. 
PD analyses will compare placebo and EP262 descriptively . No formal statistical testing will be 
performed. For select PD endpoints, the 90% confidence interval and/or nominal p- values will be 
presented . 
For select endpoints, absolute, percent change, and/or fold-change from baseline will be 
summarized. Correlation analysis between responses in disease severity scores and changes in select PD parameters may be explored. Additional information will be provided in the SAP. 
15.8. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The PK Set will be used for the summaries of plasma concentration s of EP262. A descriptive 
summary of the observed plasma concentrations will be displayed by [CONTACT_5586]. 
15.9. Subgroup Analyses  
Given the small sample size, no formal subgroup analyses are planned for this study.  
15.10.  Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity  
No adjustment for multiplicity will be performed  due to the hypothesis generating nature of this 
study.  
15.11.  Planned Interim Analysis  
Given the hypothesis-generating nature of this study, an interim analysis may be conducted. The interim analysis would evaluate the effects of EP262 on s elect PD endpoints and safety. 
The decision to conduct an optional interim analysis and the timing of the analysis will be documented in the study file s prior to conduct of the interim analysis. Additional details about 
the interim analysis, if applicable, will be provided in the SAP, which is to be finalized before

The Investigator, the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s representatives will preserve the confidentiality 
of all subjects participating in this study, in accordance with ICH GCP, local regulations, and 
institutional requirements. Only year of birth, age at Screening, and study subject number will be 
used to identify subjects on the eCRFs and other study- related documents submitted to the 
Sponsor (or designee). Documents that are not submitted to the Sponsor (eg, ICFs) should be kept in strict confidence by [CONTACT_340349].  
In compliance with ICH GCP, it is required that the Investigator and institution permit 
authorized representatives of the Sponsor, the IRB/IEC, the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ), and other appropriate regulatory authority or health authority inspectors’ direct access to 
all study -related sites, source data, documents, and reports for verification of study records and 
data. Direct access is the permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of a clinical study. The Investigator is obligated to inform and obtain consent from the subject to permit these representatives to have access to their 
study-related records for this verification. Any party (eg,  domestic and foreign regulatory 
authorities, Sponsors, auditors) with direct access should take all reasonable precautions within 
the constraints of the applicable regulatory requirement(s) to maintain the confidentiality of subjects.  
In case of data security breach, measures to mitigate possible adverse effects for subjects will be 
applied as per the CRO’s standard operating procedure ( SOP). 
16.5. Case Report Forms  
eCRFs will be used for this study. Site personnel will receive training on eCRF completion. Each eCRF is to be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_737].  
During periodic monitoring visits, the eCRFs will be made available to the study monitor so that 
he or she may verify the data entries with the source documentation. 
16.6. Source Documents  
The Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents (eg,  medical 
records, 12-lead ECG results, raw data collection forms) to record all observations and other 
pertinent data for each subject enrolled into the study. The data r ecorded on the eCRFs will be 
derived from these source documents. The Investigator will ensure that data on the eCRFs and completed queries are accurate, consistent with source documentation, and submitted to the Sponsor in a timely manner. The Investigator will also ensure that all data on required study logs are accurate and kept up to date.  
16.7. Records Retention  
The Investigator must maintain essential study documents (protocol and amendments, completed eCRFs, source documentation, signed ICFs, relevant correspondence and approvals, and all other supporting documentation) until notified by [CONTACT_1034]. Subject identification codes (subject 
names and corresponding study numbers) will be retained for this same period and stored 
separately. Custody of the records may be transferred to another responsible party, acceptable to the Sponsor, which agrees to abide by [CONTACT_941] r etention policies. Written notice of transfer must be

being considered for inclusion in the study is given a full explanation of the study. The Investigator, or his/her designee, shall inform each subject, in writing, of all aspects pertaining to 
participation in the study, including (but not limited to) aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential risks. Subjects will have the opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether to participate. Subjects should understand that they are free to refuse to 
participate in, or to withdraw from, the study at any time without prejudice or loss of medical 
care to which they are otherwise entitled. Each subject must personally sign and date a study-specific ICF to be a subject in the study. The ICF must be countersigned by [CONTACT_9257] 
(or designee) who conducted the informed consent discussion. This will be documented on a 
written ICF. Each ICF will include the elements required by [INVESTIGATOR_28936] 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR ) 50 and ICH E6, Section 4.8. The Investigator agrees to obtain approval from the Sponsor 
of any written informed consent for use in the study before submission to the IRB/IEC. 
Each subject who provides written informed consent for the study (by [CONTACT_340350]), will be given a copy of the signed ICF. The original will be kept in the subject’s medical 
record or study chart as permitted by [CONTACT_8236]. The Investigator will inform subjects of new 
information that may be relevant to the subjects’ willingness to continue participation in the study according to local ethics requirements. 
It is important to obtain complete follow -up for all subjects. Every attempt should be made to 
undertake all protocol- specified assessments and complete the eCRFs except for those subjects 
who specifically withdraw consent for release of such information. 
16.9. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in 
the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with GCP, ICH guidelines, other applicable 
regulatory requirements (eg, local requirements), the study protocol, and where applicable, Sponsor and/or CRO SOPs . 
16.10.  Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
The Investigator will not begin the study until the protocol and ICF have been approved by [CONTACT_340351]/IEC. Any amendments to the protocol must also be approved in writing by [CONTACT_299524]/IEC, before implementation by [CONTACT_737], except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to subjects.  
All IRB/IEC correspondence, including progress reports, will be retained on file at the site. 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page [ADDRESS_421179] without proper 
notification to the Sponsor (or designee). Only the Sponsor may revise the protocol. Any change 
in study conduct considered necessary by [CONTACT_340352], who will then issue a formal protocol revision to implement the change and obtain regulatory and ethic approval. The only exception is when the Investigator considers a subject’s safety to be compromised if i mmediate action is not taken.  
In the event of an important deviation from the protocol, the Investigator or designee must contact [CONTACT_340353]. This will allow an early joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the study.  
Examples of important deviations include: 
• Subject did not give appropriate informed consent 
• Inclusion or exclusion criteria not satisfied 
• Non-permitted concomitant medications that may meaningfully impact PD  or safety 
outcomes 
• Meaningful dosing error 
• Randomization error 
The Investigator and Sponsor will both document this decision. The IRB/IEC will be informed of 
all important protocol deviations by [CONTACT_340354]. 
17.2. Publications  
No publication of the results shall take place without the Sponsor’s written consent. All 
publication or presentation rights for the findings of the clinical investigation under this protocol 
shall be governed by [CONTACT_340355], the investigational site, and the Sponsor.

Protocol EP-262-202 was amended to extend (from 60 days to 84 days [12 weeks]) the duration after the last dose of study drug 
during which subjects with reproductive capability are restricted from egg/sperm donation and are to use acceptable forms of contraception. This modification is based on preliminary trends in emerging EP262 pharmacokinetic data from the ongoing clini cal 
studies. The extension will remain in effect as a safety precaution until results f rom definitive reproductive and development toxicity 
studies of EP262 are available.  
This protocol amendment also includes an update regarding excluded medications and clarifies that only female subjects with a negative serum pregnancy test at S creening are eligible for participation in the study. 
Notable changes are included below in the summary table. Revised text in Amendment 4.0 is bolded, and text deleted from Amendment 3.0 is crossed out in the table below. Italicized text is used to describe a change.  Minor/editorial changes are not listed

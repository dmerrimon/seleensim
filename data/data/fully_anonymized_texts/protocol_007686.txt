3 8.3 Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing  .................................................[ADDRESS_1064818] enhanced ultrasound  (CEUS)  of the kidneys to predict 
kidney mass histologic diagnosis , subtype  and st age. 
1.[ADDRESS_1064819] 2 decades with nearly 70 ,000 new cases projected for 20 19[1, 2] . This exponential 
growth is attributable largely to increased detection of incidental small kidney masses [3, 4]. Most of these small masses are resected; however, 
only 20% harbor aggressive disease. The remaining 80% consist of benign tumors or non- aggressive cancers [5-7] that may not need resection. 
Unfortunately, current diagnostic techniques do not reliably differentiate aggressive from non -aggressive subtypes. Identifying non-aggressive 
subtypes pre- resection would reduce unnecessary surgeries and 
associated risks including kidney function loss, a risk particularly high among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD).   Contrast -enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) are the standard tests to diagnose kidney cancer and guide management. However, CT and MRI have key disadvantages that limit their ability to precisely diagnose and stage kidney cancer resulting in costly surgeries and their associated morbidities in patients that  may not have 
needed resection. First, both modalities capture image snapshots over time, and important enhancement characteristics may be missed if the snapshot is not timed correctly. Second, contrast extravasation leads to decreased sensitivity to vascu lar enhancement, limiting their staging ability. Third, CT 
and MRI are contraindicated among individuals with moderate and severe CKD, contrast allergies and/or metal implants, relegating these patients to substandard diagnostics. Ultrasound (US) is a safe, inexpensive and accessible imaging tool often used in patients with CKD, but it suffers from a lack of sensitivity. Given the rising incidence of kidney cancer and the increasing number of individuals with CKD who cannot undergo CT/MRI, there is an urgent and unmet need to identify imaging that can safely and accurately differentiate kidney masses needing resection from those that do not. Moreover, among all individuals with kidney masses, including those without CT/MRI contraindications, there is a clear  and unmet need to 
identify imaging that can accurately diagnose subtype and characterize vascular involvement, a key factor in cancer staging.  
 
We propose to investigate an advanced contrast -enhanced ultrasound 
(CEUS) technique as a novel imaging tool to address these critical gaps in 
kidney mass diagnosis and staging. We will accomplish the following aims:

5 1) to predict histologic subtype and stage using 3D CEUS -generated 
metrics in humans and 2) to compare the predictive capabilities of 2 different 
CEUS imaging techniques (one using bolus and one using infusion  
injection ) in humans.  
1.3 Kidney Cancer Histologic Subtypes  
The majority of kidney cancers are renal cell carcinomas (RCC) of which there are three main subtypes: clear cell, papi[INVESTIGATOR_775207]. The subtypes differ in incidence, prognosis [8, 9]  and vascularity [10]. Accurate 
subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_775208]- making as less aggressive subtypes 
do not require immediate resection. Differentiation of clear cell (a higher risk subtype requiring resection) from other subtypes or benign kidney masses has the potential to reduce unnecessary surgeries [6]. CT/MRI, the 
predominant imaging modalities used to diagnose RCC, do not reliably predict cancer subtype or grade. Other than surgical resection, biopsy is the only reliable way to preoperatively determine histologic subtype and tumor grade. However, biopsy is not performed at all centers [11] and is subject to 
sampling error, with as many as 20% of biopsies being non- diagnostic[12] .  
 
Differences in tissue vascularity cause differing tissue enhancement [13]. 
CEUS is highly sensitive for tissue enhancement which can be leveraged 
to differentiate kidney mass subtype based on enhancement properties. Previous studies have reported accurate diagnosis [14] and subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007][15]  of 
kidney masses using single plane CEUS with qualitative interpretations. 3D CEUS -generated metrics will capture enhancement in multiple planes and 
thus produce a more complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_775209]. Specifically, we will use 3D CEUS -generated quantitative metrics to characterize mass 
vascularity. 
1.[ADDRESS_1064820]/MRI -derived staging. Tumors confined to the kidney are stage 
[ADDRESS_1064821]/MRI often miss subtle vascular involvement,  leaving such 
involvement undetected until pathologic inspection post -resection, making 
preoperative prognosis estimation inaccurate. Stages 1, [ADDRESS_1064822] very different survival rates (81%, 74% and 53% [1], respectively), rendering 
accurate preoperative staging essential for surgical planning and patient counseling. 3D CEUS’ vascular enhancement sensitivity and real -time 
imaging may better characterize small vessel involvement, aiding surgical planning and patient counseling. In addition, 3D volume rendering of t he 
vessels may be useful for vasculature- based mass staging.

6 CKD severity [16]. As CKD severity worsens, contrast CT/MRI risks also 
increase. If such patients  undergo contrast CT, they risk kidney function 
loss and potential progression to end- stage kidney disease. If they undergo 
contrast MRI, they risk development of a rare but devastating disease, 
nephrogenic sclerosing fibrosis. However, without such imaging, they either risk missed detection of a mass needing resection or undergo preemptive resection, potentially of a mass not needing resection and resulting in further loss of kidney function. Identification of a contrast imaging tool that does not pose increased risks to patients with CKD would eliminate these unnecessary risks.  
The advanced CEUS techniques of 3D imaging provides a powerful 
opportunity to fill existing gaps in kidney mass care, including subtype prediction and staging. Additionally, for those with advanced CKD and other 
contraindications to CT/MRI, CEUS allows for contrast imaging not possible with existing imaging options.  
1.[ADDRESS_1064824]/MRI. Unlike 
contrast CT/MRI, CEUS captures real -time images, enabling dynamic 
visualization of contrast over time. In addition, the CEUS contrast agent, microbubbles, remains intravascular, and is thus sensitive to lesion enhancement and small vessel involvement, giving CEUS the pot ential to 
inform kidney mass staging and surgical planning, capabilities not currently possessed by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI.   In addition, CEUS microbubbles differ from CT/MRI contrast agents in that they are cleared by [CONTACT_775224], making CEUS safe for patients with advanced CKD. 
For these individuals, CEUS availability would mean access to contrast -
enhanced imaging, which would significantly improve the ability to provide a definitive  mass diagnosis and increase the chance of avoiding 
unnecessary surgery. CEUS maintains the advantages of conventional US (lower cost in comparison to CT/MRI and safety).  
 To-date, most CEUS research has utilized a 2D approach. By [CONTACT_775225], we can generate three- dimensional (3D) CEUS 
images. Our preliminary work suggests that expanding 2D CEUS to a 3D technique will provide deeper data about mass enhancement, facilitating subtype differentiation. Moreover, our group has developed image analysis 
techniques that can generate 3D renderings of the vasculature (described below).   
 
In 2D or 3D CEUS, microbubbles can be administered by [CONTACT_775226] (MI) and flash- replenishment imaging (F -R), respectively. The two 
approaches yield different information. The optimal approach is unknown.

7 With bolus administration of undiluted microbubbles, CEUS quantifies 
measurements like peak intensity, time to peak intensity, and wash-in/wa sh-out rates from the time intensity curve (TIC), each of which may be 
used to predict mass subtype. Alternatively, infusion of diluted microbubbles facilitates longer imaging times and uses faster frame rates. Longer imaging time allows for imaging in multiple planes which can capture multiple masses or different planes in a single mass, providing richer information. Faster frame rates can capture rapid wash- in rates with greater granularity 
than bolus dosing. However, the infusion method TIC does not quantify a wash -out rate, eliminating one metric that may contribute to subtype 
classification accuracy. Existing data suggest that bolus dosing 2D CEUS has comparable accuracy for malignancy detection compared to contrast -
enhanced CT and MRI [17]. The accuracy of infusion dosing is unknown. 
We will adapt both approaches to generate 3D CEUS images.  
1.[ADDRESS_1064825] -Enhanced Ultrasound Diagnostic Imaging of the Kidney  
Ultrasound (US) imaging of the kidney is typi[INVESTIGATOR_775210]. Without contrast, malignant tumors often cannot be definitively differentiated from benign tumors or pseudotumors. For this reason, following the identification of a kidney lesion via US without 
contrast, contrast -enhanced CT or MRI is then performed to stage and 
grade the lesion.  
 
CEUS of the kidney for mass or lesion characterization is currently being 
performed in only certain centers in the [LOCATION_002] and is more widespread outside the [LOCATION_002]. US contrast agents are gas -filled 
microbubbles which are intravenously administered in very small volume boluses or slow infusions. These microbubbles typi[INVESTIGATOR_775211] 1 to 6 μm, remain intravascular for several minutes, and 
do not diffuse into the interstitium (pure blood- pool agents) [18]. Three US 
contrast agents are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for human use: perflutren lipid microspheres (Definity®), sulfur hexafluoride 
lipid microspheres and perflutren protein- type A microspheres (Optison®). 
All are FDA indicated for use in cardiac studies . The intent of this study is 
not to change the labeling of either FDA -approved agent.  
1.[ADDRESS_1064826] Agents  
Definity® (perflutren lipid) is an FDA -approved US contrast agent indicated 
to opacify the left ventricular chamber and to improve the delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border in patients with sub -optimal 
echoc ardiograms. It is activated by [CONTACT_544703] a Vialmix® 
which produces a milky white injectable suspension of perflutren lipid microspheres composed of octafluoropropane. Activated perflutren may be injected by [CONTACT_775227]. See

information. When used in this setting, the maximum dose of perflutren is administered as either bolus doses or one single intravenous infusion.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1064827] been 
shown to be quite safe[ 19, 20] . In pre -market clinical trials, 1716 subjects 
were evaluated with activated perflutren lipid. Of the 1716 subjects, 144 (8.4%) had at least one treatment -related adverse reaction. There were 26 
serious adverse events and 15 (0.9%) subjects discontinued because of an adverse event, [ADDRESS_1064828] pain, dyspnea or back pain. The events appeared within 1 – 15 minutes of the drug administration and were of moderate intensity 
resolving usually without treatment within minutes or hours after onset. Of 
the 11 other serious adverse events, which appeared within 2- 15 days of 
the drug administration, all appeared to be a progression of underlying cardiac and non- cardiac disease. Nineteen subjects (1. 1%) suffered serious 
cardiopulmonary adverse events including [ADDRESS_1064829] common events were (% of patients experiencing): headache (2.3%), back and renal pain (1.2%), flushing (1.1%) and nausea (1.0%).  
Initial post -marketing experience, which included over 1 million patients with 
5 years surveillance, showed the only medically significant risk was rare allergic events, occurring at a rate of 1 in 10,000[20] .

1.11 Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Anaphylaxis to perflutren is extremely rare, however, in case of a severe 
reaction, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_294366]® (epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) injections will be kept near the US machine for all patients.  
1.12 High Ultrasound Mechanical Index (MI)  
While high ultrasound MI of the heart may cause microbubble cavitation and subsequent ventricular arrhythmias, this was seen only at MI>1.6, higher than the typi[INVESTIGATOR_775212], with an agent no longer in clinical use. [22] No premature ventricular contractions were seen with 
MI≤1.1. Large clinical trials using MI≤1.[ADDRESS_1064832] shown no significant concerns for arrhythmias [9, 20, 23] . 
Nevertheless, the safety of perflutren at MIs >0.8 has not yet been established by [CONTACT_3455]. However, real -time measurement of renal 
blood flow in 19 healthy subjects using perflutren was reported, using a flash replenishment high- MI (MI of 1.0) US technique. The contrast agent was 
well tolerated with no serious adverse events. One patient each had a 20mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure, a very brief and mild epi[INVESTIGATOR_771009], and mild back pain, but no cardiac arrhythmias were recorded during the study period [24]. A second study using Sonovue® contrast agent 
with flash -replenishment high- MI to detect changes in kidney perfusion via 
US in 10 normal volunteers reported the agent was well tolerated, and not associated with any adverse events [25].  
Small pre -clinical studies performed in rodents and pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] [26-29] showed 
conflicting results. One group showed glomerular capi[INVESTIGATOR_775213] e other groups showed no sign of damage. Recently 
published work in a rat model using clinically relevant parameters for CEUS 
high MI flash- replenishment imaging showed no long- term changes in 
histology or clinical chemistry measurements [30]. The clinical relevance of 
these findings has not yet been investigated and is believed to be minimal, if any.  
1.[ADDRESS_1064833] been performed, primarily in 
rodent kidneys but also larger animals like rabbit and pig, that investigate overall perfusion of diseased kidneys [31-33] or kidneys exposed to various 
medications [34, 35] . In the field of oncology, many pre- clinical studies have 
been performed to determine the sensitivity of CEUS  for detection of 
malignancy [36-38]. The use of targeted microbubbles (with antibodies 
attached to the microbubble surface) has been investigated in this field as well[39, 40] . 
LINEBERGER COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER  Imaging Protocol Template  
CLINICAL ONCOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM    February [ADDRESS_1064834] -specific US 
techniques such as CPS (Contrast Pulse Sequencing). Such imaging techniques provide high- resolution images of tissue vasculature and allow 
the assessment of the microcirculation patterns in real-time[41-47]. Outside 
of the [LOCATION_002], or in the context of clinical trials, other US contrast 
agents have been used in kidney imaging[43, 44, 47- 51]. Levovist® (lipid 
and galactose microparticle suspension) and Sonovue®  (lyophilized sulfur 
hexafluoride microbubbles), two non- FDA approved similar US contrast 
agents approved for use in countries outside of the [LOCATION_002], have also been used in the general population to identify and diagnose kidney pseudotumors[52] , cystic kidney lesions [44, 48, 50, 53] , and solid kidney 
lesions [47, 51] . 
In the [LOCATION_002], where there has been significantly less research on using US contrast in humans, the US contrast agent, Definity®, was used in one study to measure renal blood flow in a healthy population[24] , 
effectively reproducing previous animal studies in the human population. Multiple contrast agents were used in a large retrospective study of CEUS 
in patients with kidney lesions [54] and showed excellent sensitivity (100%) 
and specificity (99%). Since that study, several smaller studies in the [LOCATION_002] have looked at CEUS in the kidney and consistently shown excellent sensitivity [55, 56] . Studies outside the [LOCATION_002] show similar 
sensitivities and specificities[17, 57] . 
1.15 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosages for Definity are based on package inserts, expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_775214], and our previous experience from clinical trials (IRB 12- 2314, 15- 1866, 17 -1130). Because 
the kidney is a very vascular organ, use of 0.2mL Definity has been adequate for visualization of lesion enhancement. Our experience has been with both bolus doses of 0.2mL and infusion at set rates based on BMI. The infusion rate or dose can be increased or decreased if visualization is not adequate. Use of either small boluses or infusion allows for multiple injections for patients with multiple lesions. Patients with greater abdominal girth and multiple lesions may require a 2nd  vial as their bolus doses or rate 
of infusion will be higher. All microbubble contrast agents are injected intravenously.  
The greatest risk is of an unknown hypersensitivity reaction to the microbubbles as many patients will not have previous exposure to these contrast agents. However, the rate of true allergic reactions is low and similar to that for gadolinium -based contrast agents. Other risks are 
transient and resolve when the contrast agent is cleared. Overall the risk is minimal. Benefits include improved visualization of kidney lesions compared to non- contrasted ultrasound and the potential reduction of total

4.2.2  Imaging Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Low MI  imaging with sweeps  
Upon subject arrival, a urine pregnancy test will be conducted for subjects 
with child bearing potential.  Once confirmed that a subject is eligible, a nurse will place an intravenous (IV) catheter, and a sonographer will determine mas s location and approach with a baseline B -mode US. The 
nurse will prepare the CEUS contrast agent, Definity®, to be administered via infusion pump according to package insert instructions. We will use a 
Siemens ACUSON Sequoia S512 with a 4C1 curved array t ransducer 
equipped with cadence pulse sequencing technology for contrast -enhanced 
imaging.  
 
Each subject will be injected with a bolus of 0.2- 0.4 mL undiluted 
microbubbles placed on an infusion pump for consistent injection rate and 
followed by 5mL sterile saline. The sonographer will capture sweeps through the kidney in 2- 3 different planes (i.e. x -y, y-z, or x -z) of imaging 
during contrast infusion. Each imaging plane will require a new bolus. During imaging, the subject will be instructed to take shallow breaths to minimize movement artifact. We will capture a B -mode image perpendicular 
to each sweep direction to determine the total length of each sweep. The 
subject will be instructed to take shallow breaths to minimize movement artifact. Imaging time will be 15- 20 minutes.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Flash -replenishment infusion imaging  
Following low MI bolus imaging, we will use the F -R infusion protocol and 
infuse diluted  microbubbles with a calibrated syringe pump. We will

An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an 
abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or  clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_775216] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression

UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL  
17 should not be recorded  as an AE, unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_759355].  
6.1.2  Suspected Adverse Reaction  (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  
means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse  reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
Causality assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in 
consideration of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant drug exposures, norm al 
clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.   Other factors to consider in considering 
drug as the cause of the AE:  
• Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, 
Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
• One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture) ; often more than once occurrence from one 
or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug caused 
the event.   
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug 
treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group  
6.1.[ADDRESS_1064846] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurr ing with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
6.1.4  Serious AE  or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death;  
LINEBERGER COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER  Imaging Protocol Template  
CLINICAL ONCOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM    February 2017  
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL  
18 • Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>24 hours) or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];*  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions;  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purposes, 
also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event.  
 *Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353184], central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events.  
 Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE.  
6.[ADDRESS_1064847] begin from day 1 of 
study treatment and continue through the 30 -day follow- up period after 
treatment is discontinued.   
 
Collected information should be recorded in the Case Report Forms (CRF) 
for that patient. Please include a description of the event, its severity or toxicity grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship 
to the study drug.   Documentation should occur at least monthly .  
6.3 SAEs or Serious SAR s  
6.3.1  Timing  
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs 
related to invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout ).  
 For any other experience or condi tion that meets the definition of an SAE or 
a serious SAR , recording of the event  must begin from day 1 of study 
treatment and continue through the 30 -day follow -up period after treatment 
is discontinued.   
LINEBERGER COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER  Imaging Protocol Template  
CLINICAL ONCOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM    February 2017  
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL  
19 6.3.2  Documentation and Notification 
These events (SAEs  or Serious SARs) must be recorded in the SAE 
console  within Oncore ™ for that patient within 24 hours of learning of its 
occurrence.  
6.3.3  Reporting  
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
• The UNC- IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the I RB’s 
web-based reporting system  within 7 days of the Investigator 
becoming aware of the problem.   
Pregnancy  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy 
test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study  should be recorded as SAEs.  The patient is to be 
discontinued immediately from the study. The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician- gynecologist, preferabl y one experienced in 
reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  
 The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must document the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome). If the outcome of the pregnancy was 
abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE.   
6.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_301829] (DSMC).  
Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequency dependent on stu dy 
accrual, and in consultation with the study Biostatistician.  These meetings 
will include the investigators as well as protocol nurses, clinical research associates, regulatory associates, data managers, biostatisticians, and any other relevant personnel the principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, the research team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, safety, regulatory, data collection, etc.  
 The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by [CONTACT_87227], but not limited to,  the oversight (Office of Human

21 7.1.2  Secondary Objectives  
[IP_ADDRESS]  To compare diagnostic accuracy of F -R infusion imaging technique 
to low MI bolus imaging technique.  
The proposed tests with sample size [ADDRESS_1064853] 63.2% power to detect a 
difference of 0.1 in the AUCs (.8 vs .9) and 88.7 % power to detect a 
difference of 0.15 (0.8 vs 0.95).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  To predict kidney mass stage using 3D CEUS -generated metrics 
Based on our clinical experience, we estimate [ADDRESS_1064854] a T2a 
category or lower lesion and 25% of those will have a change from clinical 
to pathological staging. A sample size of [ADDRESS_1064855] errors will inform larger future studies. 
7.2 Data Analysi s Plans  
7.2.1  Predicting kidney mass diagnosis using 3D CEUS generated metrics.  
Image Analysis (Low MI TIC analysis): We will use  Matlab (Mathworks , 
Natick, MA) for time intensity curve ( TIC) analysis and 3D volume rendering. 
For each imaging plane, we will create a region of interest (ROI) by [CONTACT_775233]. We will produce a TIC by [CONTACT_775234] -in rate (WI), wash -out rate (WO), mean transit time 
(MTT), time to peak (TTP) and peak enhancement relative to the surrounding parenchyma (PE) for each x -sweep position. A weighted 
average based on the ROI area at each position will be used to produce 
single values for the 3D volume for each TIC metric (WI, WO, MTT, TTP and PE). We will repeat this process for each plane of imaging.  
3D volume rendering
: We will also create 3D renderings of the t umor 
vasculature from the CEUS images. We will sort the image data collected over the 3- minute period after a bolus injection by [CONTACT_941] x - (or y -) sweep 
position, then by [CONTACT_775235]- out period. We  will produce a cumulative contrast image 
(CCI) at each position with the time- dependent image data by [CONTACT_775236]-dependent image data at each position. The images show where the 
microbubbles have travelled throughout the acquisition period, and sinc e 
microbubbles are confined to the vascular spaces, the images provide excellent delineation of the vasculature. We will stack the CCIs together to create a 3D rendering.  
Multiparametric score and statistical analysis:  We will combine the 
quantitative data derived from CEUS image analyses into a single score. For the primary analysis using the gold 

LINEBERGER COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER  Imaging Protocol Template  
CLINICAL ONCOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM    February [ADDRESS_1064856] of histologic diagnosis to differentiate clear cell from non- clear cell 
tumors, we will use logistic regression to build predictive models based on 
multiple parameters from CEUS (WI, WO, MTT, TTP, PE and tumor 
volume), B -mode US images (length, echogenicity, shape), as well as 
patient factors (age, sex, race) (Table 1 ). We will assess the effects of 
individual parameters using hypothesis tests based on parameter estimates from the fitted logistic regression model. This approach facilitates assessment of the added value of the CEUS measurements over other patient factors. We will calculate nonparametric estimates and 95 % 
confidence intervals for area under the curve (AUC) using the fitted logistic regression models, both with and without non- CEUS patient factors. We will 
use model selection procedures, including AUC, to identify a final model, with a one -sided test of  AUC ≤.8 vs AUC ≥.8 at alpha=.[ADDRESS_1064857] of AUC<=0.8 vs AUC>=.8 at 
alpha=.[ADDRESS_1064858] Comparator: Histologic diagnosis from pathologic tissue.  
7.2.2  Comparing diagnostic accuracy of F- R infusion imaging technique to 
low MI bolus imaging technique.  
Image Analysis (Flash -Replenishment TIC analysis):  For each 0.[ADDRESS_1064859] signal intensity over the time course of the F -
R. We will model TIC using a mono- exponential equation, UI=A(1 - e
-βt), 
where UI is ultrasound intensity and β , the slope of the tangent to the curve, 
represent s the rate of perfusion. The height of the curve, A, represents the 
perfusion volume. To produce a single value for β for the entire tumor 
volume, we will calculate a weighted average based on the ROI area of the mass at each step. This value will serve as  the WI rate.  
Gold Standard Comparator: Histologic diagnosis from pathologic tissue.  
Statistical Analysis: We will follow the model building and evaluation 
strategy used for the primary objective. This will be done separately for bolus and infusion imaging modalities, as well as combining the two multiparametric scores. We will compare AUCs from final logistic regression models obtained for bolus and infusion using a Z -test at alpha=0.05, with 
standard errors obtained by [CONTACT_63676][INVESTIGATOR_775217]. We will conduct similar tests comparing the AUC based on the combined model to those based on bolus and infusion multiparametric scores separately. The proposed tests with sample size [ADDRESS_1064860] 80% power to 
detect a difference of .1 in the AUCs ( 0.8 vs 0.9) and 90% power to detect 
a difference of 0.15 (0.8 vs 0 .95).

23 7.2.3  Predicting kidney mass stage using 3D CEUS -generated metrics 
Image Eligibility:  CEUS mass images from individuals with clinical stage 
T2a or lower tumors will be eligible for this sub- analysis. We estimate that 
15 tumors will meet these criteria since over 50% of kidney cancer 
resections at UNC are for T2a or lower clinical stage tum ors.  
Imaging Procedure and Analysis:  We will use Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, 
MA) to measure WI and WO rates from TIC analyses. We will apply the 3D 
volume rendering exploratory analyses described in the primary outcome  to 
this outcome measure . Qualitative interpretation of 3D volume renderings 
will be assessed and compared to the clinical outcome.  
Gold Standard Comparator:  We will compare the gold standard of post -
surgical pathologic stage to WI/WO rates generated from CEUS TICs.  
Statistical Analysis:  We wi ll use the continuous variables of WI and WO to 
predict the binary outcome measure of pathologic stage T3 disease or greater. We will calculate means (standard deviations) and 95% confidence intervals for WI and WO for those ≥ stage T3 vs. < stage T3, and compare 
via t-tests at alpha=.05. We will use logistic regression to assess ability of 
WI and WO to predict stage T3 disease or greater, both separately and together. We will obtain nonparametric estimates of AUC along with 95% confidence intervals for WI alone, WO alone, and WI and WO combined using the fitted logistic regression models. We will also add patient specific factors to the logistic regression models, to assess the added value of the WI and WO measurements, with analyses to include tests of the  effect 
parameters from the fitted logistic regression models and estimates and confidence intervals for AUCs from those models.

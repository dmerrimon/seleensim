Why are  you being invited to take part in a research study?
(If you are  being asked to give permission for another person (example: your child) to be in 
this research study, as you read this consent form, “you” always refers to that person.
You are  being asked to participate because you are [ADDRESS_603991] a 
diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis (OA) have been selected to participate in a control group 
without a diagnosis of knee OA. 
What should  you know about a research study?
Your  participation is completely voluntary.
You  can stop or leave at any time and your decision will not affect your relationship 
with this institution or your normal care.

your health, welfare, or choice to stay in the research.
You  can ask all the questions you want before deciding if you want to be in this study.
Why is  this research being done?
The purpose of  this study is to find out whether activation or training of the abdominal 
muscles has an effect on the walking patterns of people with knee OA. The study will 
compare the walking patterns of participants with and without knee OA, then determine 
whether education on turning the abdominal muscles on while walking, and a six-week 
abdominal training program, improves the walking ability.

Page [ADDRESS_603992]?
We expect that you  will be in this research study for about [ADDRESS_603993] knee OA, but 
only one day if you do not. For those with knee OA, about 10-12 hours total over the span of 
the 8 weeks will be required. The 8 weeks of participation will conclude after the end of the 
6-week intervention program and the final walking assessment. 
How many people  will be in the research?
We expect about  50 people to participate in this research at our site. Approximately 50 
people will participate in the entire study nationally, since this is the only site where 
participants will be recruited. 
What happens  if I say yes, I want to be in this research?
For those  who decide they wish to participate, the extent of participation will depend on 
whether or not they have a diagnosis of knee OA. For both groups, all research activity will 
take place in the LSU Health-Shreveport School of Allied Health Professions (SAHP), located 
at [ADDRESS_603994] an alarm, or an investigator giving you a cue, 
as to whether or not you are contracting the muscle correctly. You will then be asked to

when you enter the building, unless you are a participant in with knee OA and choose to 
participate in an exercise group and/or exercise in the open gym during the 6-week training 
program.
The following  information is only for those with a diagnosis of knee OA:
Those with  knee OA will then enroll in a 6-week abdominal muscle exercise program. This 
will include two appointments per week with the investigator, which will last 30-[ADDRESS_603996] day. 
What are  my responsibilities if I take part in this research?
For those  without a diagnosis of knee OA:
You will  be responsible for participating in a single walking assessment in the Gait Lab. 
For those  with a diagnosis of knee OA:
You will  be responsible for participating in two walking assessments in the Gait Lab, before 
and after the 6-week training program. You will be asked to attend 12 exercise sessions (two 
appointments per week), not missing more than [ADDRESS_603997] once per week. 
What are  my other options if I do not want to be in this research? 
You do  not have to be in this study. If you decide not to be in the research now or later, it 
will not affect your usual care and it won’t be held against you.
You do  not have to be in this study to receive treatment for your knee OA. You are free to 
participate in other treatment activities without participating in this study.
Instead of  being in this research, your choices may include treatment by a physician, 
surgeon, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], or other healthcare provider.

discomfort upon removal of adhesive markers due to hair on the skin of your legs or

services ordinarily covered because these services were performed in a research study. You 
should check with your insurance to see what services will be covered by [CONTACT_471330].
Tests and  procedures done solely because you are in the research study are not considered ordinary 
care.  The research specific costs will be at no charge to you or your insurance company.
Will being  in this study help me in any way?
 We  cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. 
However, possible benefits include improved walking mechanics and function after the 6-
week intervention program for those with knee OA.

4.0 Background and Rationale
4.1 Background
Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a 
loss of homeostasis of the tear film, and accompanied by [CONTACT_72069], in which tear 
film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and 
neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles (Craig 2017).
To date, management and treatment of DED remains a large unmet medical need. Current 
mainstays include use of artificial tears and in more severe cases, tear retention 
(temporarily or permanently plugging the tear ducts) and anti-inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(Craig 2017). Artificial tears have been used for relief for symptoms of eye dryness 
(burning, irritation, and discomfort) and have proven to be safe and effective for 
lubricating and protecting the ocular surface from further irritation and relieving eye 
dryness symptoms.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is a gap in our knowledge as to the effect of ABBV-[ADDRESS_878547] tolerability and the patient eye drop experience. ABBV-444 is developed to meet 
the requirements of section 505G of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, 
including the over-the-counter (OTC) drug monograph and other applicable requirements, 
therefore ABBV-444 can be brought to market in the US via the OTC drug monograph  

P24-203 Protocol
Version date: [ADDRESS_878548] use over time in adult patients with dry eye (patients with 
symptoms of burning, irritation, discomfort due to eye dryness).
5.2.1 Primary Objective
The primary objective is to assess whether ABBV-444 will reduce patient symptoms 
when evaluated by [CONTACT_431377].
5.2.2 Secondary Objectives
The secondary objective is to investigate the patient eye drop experience of ABBV-444 
and the eye drop onset of action using a VAS-Current Symptom Survey. 

P24-203 Protocol
Version date: [ADDRESS_878549] of 
ABBV-444 on relieving dry eye symptoms, such as burning, irritation, discomfort due to 
eye dryness (via the OSDI scoring tool), the patient experience (via a Patient Eye Drop 
Experience Survey) and the onset of action of the eye drop (via the Current Symptom 
Survey) across various timepoints (Figure 1). This will be an open-label, 1-arm study in 
which eye drops will be administered bilaterally as needed but minimally twice a day. 
Approximately [ADDRESS_878550] 4 hours prior to Baseline Visit. There will be three surveys 
administered to the subjects throughout the course of the study at the following 
timepoints:

Version date: [ADDRESS_878557] on the 
participant's ability to function, scaled into a 0 (no disease) to 100 (maximum 
severity of disease) score. Participants will complete the OSDI at Screening 
Visit, Baseline Visit, Day 14 and Day 30/Early exit.
Patient Eye Drop Experience Survey will evaluate the short- and long-term 
subjective eye drop experience in relief and tolerability with the study eye 
drops using a VAS. All participants will complete the Patient Eye Drop 
Experience Survey Day 14 and Day 30/Early exit. Participants should be 
instructed to mark a vertical line on the anchored VAS that best describes their 
agreement with the statements within the questionnaire. The vendor Lumanity 
will then convert the participant's response to a numerical value (0 to 100). 
This is an overall evaluation, not per eye.
Current Symptom Survey will evaluate the subjective onset of action of the 
eye drop as it pertains to relief and tolerability using a VAS. All participants 
will complete the Current Symptom Survey at Day 1. Survey will be 
administered at T0 (pre-dosing), T30s, T1min, T3min and T5min post-dosing. 
Participants should be instructed to mark a vertical line on the anchored VAS 
that best describes their agreement with the statements within the 
questionnaire. The vendor Lumanity will convert the participant's response to a

6.4.4 Study Drug Usage for Each Patient
The 2-question Study Eye Drop Usage Questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_654642] 14 and Day 30/Early exit to capture the date and time of their last study drug 
administration and their overall compliance to study drug usage.
Question 1: "What date and time did you last use your study eye drops?"
Question 2: "On average, how many times did you administer the eye drops per day?"
Sites should review each patient's response to ensure that the last administration of their 
using their study eye drops at minimum 2 times per day. Should either of the patient's 
responses be out of compliance, the site should discuss with the patient to ensure they 
dose correctly from that point forward.

7.3.3 Primary Analysis
The analysis is based on full analysis set (FAS). The primary endpoint is the change of 
OSDI score from baseline at Day 30. The change of OSDI score will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, standard error of the mean 
(SEM), interquartiles, min and max. A descriptive p-value (paired t-test) will be 
calculated for the change of OSDI score if the data is adequate.

dose. The score of each item in the Patient Eye Drop Experience Survey at Day 30 and the 
change of Current Symptom Survey at T5min will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, standard error of the mean (SEM), 
interquartiles, min and max. In the meanwhile, one bar plot for the mean of the score with 
95% confidence interval will be made for each of the secondary endpoints. The change of 
Current Symptom Survey score from baseline at T5min will be summarized using the 
same descriptive statistics. A descriptive p-value (paired t-test) will be calculated for the 
change of VAS score if the data is adequate.
7.3.[ADDRESS_878565] are the Patient Eye Drop Experience Survey score at 
Day 14 and the change of OSDI score from baseline at Day 14. The score of each item in 
the Patient Eye Drop Experience Survey at Day 14 and the change of OSDI score from 
baseline at Day 14 will be summarized using descriptive statistics: mean, median, 
standard deviation, standard error of the mean (SEM), interquartiles, min and max. In the 
meanwhile, one bar plot for the mean of the score with 95% confidence interval will be 
made for each of the exploratory endpoints. The change of OSDI from baseline at Day 14 
will be summarized using the same descriptive statistics. A descriptive p-value (paired 
t-test) will be calculated for the change of VAS score if the data is adequate.

the current Declaration of Helsinki and will follow the principles of International 
Conference Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) and Good Epi[INVESTIGATOR_654640] (GEP) and applicable regulatory requirements. IRB/EC notification or approval 
will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study as necessary per local Regulation.
8.3 Patient Information/Informed Consent
This study will be run in compliance with local laws and regulations. 
Notification/submission to the responsible Ethics Committee, and/or Competent 
Authorities will be performed as required by [CONTACT_10976] (see Country 
Information page [Appendix A]).
Written informed consent will be obtained prior to patient inclusion.
9.[ADDRESS_878567] the 
information in the provided AE/SAE Data Collection Form (Appendix F).
The [COMPANY_013] contact [CONTACT_654646] (Appendix A).
The following adverse event and safety information definitions and further information is 
provided should you need to report any safety information to [COMPANY_013]. 
P24-203 Protocol
Version date: [ADDRESS_878568] a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not the event is 
considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from "special situations" as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, 
occupational or accidental exposure, off-label use, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug 
withdrawal, all which must be reported whether associated with an adverse event or not. 
Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an AE and should be 
reported as a new AE.
9.2 Serious Adverse Event Definition
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a serious adverse 
event (SAE):
Death of Patient An event that results in the death of a patient.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021], would 
have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention 
had not been taken. This does not include an event that 
would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe 
form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_654641]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth or any anomaly that 
result in fetal loss. 
P24-203 Protocol
Version date: 02 February 2023
29
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a patient. 
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., 
sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but 
based on medical judgment may jeopardize the patient and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of patient, life 
threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity). Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event. Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.
9.[ADDRESS_878569] 
notify [COMPANY_013] within 15 calendar days of the physician becoming aware of the 
event, including "special situations."
[COMPANY_013] contact [CONTACT_654647] (Appendix A).
9.4 Patient Reported Outcomes and/or Quality of Life 
Questionnaires
Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) or Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires data are not 
considered a potential source of adverse events for the purposes of this study. However,  
 
 
P24-203 Protocol
Version date: 02 February 2023

the physician should review the PRO or questionnaire(s) data. If the physician identifies 
an adverse event and it is determined to be related to an [COMPANY_013] authorized product, 
report to [COMPANY_013] as described above and to the relevant Regulatory Authority, as required 
by [CONTACT_10976].
10.[ADDRESS_878570] complaints will be collected as part of this study; if at any time you need to report 
a Product Complaint (Appendix G) please refer to this section for the definition and 
reporting requirements.
11.[ADDRESS_878571] or to the medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or 
packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling 
discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (example: printing illegible), 
missing components/product, device not working properly, or packaging issues. 
P24-203 Protocol
Version date: [ADDRESS_878572] be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of the site's knowledge of the event using the contact [CONTACT_654648] A. All follow-up information is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized 
representative) and documented in source as required by [CONTACT_1034]. All complaints will 
be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint 
condition (syringe, pen, etc.). In instances where a return is requested, every effort should 
be made by [CONTACT_654649] 30 days. If returns cannot be 
accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an estimated 
date of return.
The description of the complaint is important for [COMPANY_013] in order to enable [COMPANY_013] to 
investigate and determine if any corrective actions are required.

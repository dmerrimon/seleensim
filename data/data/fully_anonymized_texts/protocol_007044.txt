          Study Title: Services to Enhance Social Functioning in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders NCT#: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Document Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1257267] adults with autism spectrum disorder are limited. TUNE In (Training to Understand and Navigate Emotions and Interactions) is a novel three-component cognitive behavioral treatment strategy to improve social functioning skills for this population. Speciﬁcally, we aim to address a broad domain of skills: social motivation, social anxiety, social cognition, and the generalization of these skills in naturalistic community environments.  Objectives: Test the eSicacy of TUNE In for adults with autism spectrum disorder with 1) change in social responsiveness scale (SRS) scores and 2) good acceptability and feasibility. Design and Methods: 50% of participants will be enrolled in the treatment (TUNE In) group and the other 50% will be enrolled in the control group (treatment as usual). The treatment group’s components include the following: 5 individual sessions (component 1), 8 group sessions broken into didactic and conversation practice parts (component 2), and 4 advocacy group sessions (component 3). The participants complete the SRS (the primary outcome measure) before and after the treatment. Additionally, at the very end of the intervention, participants complete a semi structed zoom-based qualitative interview about the acceptability and feasibility of the various components within the intervention.

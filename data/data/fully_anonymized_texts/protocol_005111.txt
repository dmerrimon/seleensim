6- What are the possible risks and discomforts?
This study does not involve major risk to study participants.

Version Date:   3/2/18 Page 5 of 10
                             Fasting for 10 hours: There is a possibility that fasting for 10 hours may make 
you feel nauseous.  
Self-reported Questionnaires: There are no anticipated risks from completing 
self-report questionnaires.  Due to the sensitive nature of the questionnaires, you 
may skip any questions that you do not wish to answer.   
Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) Measurement: You will be asked to 
change into a gown and to remove all footwear and socks/stockings.  Once 
changed and barefoot, you will be asked to stand on a scale (similar to a large 
gym scale), and you may be asked to hold on to hand electrodes on each side of 
the scale.  You will be asked to step off of the scale once the measurement is 
complete (less than one minute).  
oThere is no risk associated with the BIA measurement.  However, 
subjects with medical implants such as a pacemaker or metal joint 
replacements cannot be measured on the machine.  
Weight Gain: There is a possible chance that the Calories will slightly increase 
body weight. 
Brain MRI: This scan is performed to measure the size of your brain and 
activation.  You will change into a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56549]. During the scan, you will lie on your back on the 
scanner table with your head in a cradle.  The scanner table will then move you 
into the magnet. During the scan, you will hear loud tappi[INVESTIGATOR_56550].  You will be 
given head phones and/or earplugs for protection from the scanner noise.  You 
will also be given a call button should you need the MRI tech during the exam.  
This scan is for research purposes only and not for diagnostic treatment.
MRI Risks:   
There are no known biological risks associated with magnetic resonance 
scanning.  It has been used routinely for over 20 years.  It produces side effects 
in very few situations.  Those situations include:
Metal: Because the magnetic resonance machine uses a magnetic field, it can 
move any metallic objects that are inside the body.  This disruption of metal 
inside the body is extremely dangerous to you and may even be life threatening.  
If you think you may have a cardiac stent, metallic implant, metallic pi[INVESTIGATOR_2982], 
shrapnel, or any other metallic material in your body, it is of utmost importance 
that you alert the study coordinator or MR technician. If you have metallic 
materials in your body that cannot be removed, we will exclude you from this 
study for your safety.  
Electronics: Magnetic resonance imaging involves the use of radio frequency 
energy that can disrupt the functioning of electronic devices.  If you think you 
might possess a pacemaker or any other electronic medical device inside your 
body, it is of utmost importance that you inform the study coordinator or MR 
technician.  If you have any such electronic devices we will exclude you from this 
study for your safety.

Version Date:   3/2/18 Page 6 of 10
                             Tattoos and cosmetics: Some tattoos and cosmetics contain metallic materials 
that can heat up during scanning, especially if they are located on the part of the 
body being scanned.  If the metallic material heats up enough, you may feel an 
uncomfortable burning sensation, and a skin burn may develop.  If you have any 
tattoos or cosmetics that might contain metallic materials, please alert the study 
coordinator or MR technician.  If you feel a burning sensation on your skin, alert 
the study coordinator or MR technician.  In some cases, the amount of metallic 
material in the area being scanned is so excessive that the scan must be 
stopped.  In other cases, a cold compress placed over the metallic material will 
be used to prevent the burning sensation.
Confinement: During the MR scan, you will be lying down on a table inside of a 
metal tube.  The metal tube is a confined place.  This might produce a feeling of 
claustrophobia, which can be distressing.  If you have experienced 
claustrophobia in the past, you might become too distressed to complete the 
scan.  If you become distressed during the scan due to confinement in the 
scanner tube, please alert the MR technician and the scan will be halted.
Noise: The MRI machine creates a loud, rhythmic noise that sounds like grinding 
or churning.  This can be distressing to those who are sensitive to loud noises.  
You will be provided with headphones and/or earplugs to reduce the noise.  But if 
you find the machine noises distressing, alert the MR technician and the scan 
can be halted.
Peripheral nerve stimulation: During the MR scan, the magnetic field around 
your body goes through rapid changes.  These changes are all within safety 
limits set by [CONTACT_2165].  But, some people experience 
twitching in the nerves of their arms or legs as a result of these magnetic field 
changes.  This twitching is generally not painful, and it stops at the end of the MR 
scan.  But the feeling of inadvertent muscle twitching may make you feel 
disoriented or uncomfortable.  If you experience this and wish to stop the scan as 
a result, please tell the MR technician.
Physical frailty: The MR technologist performing the scan has received 
extensive training in how to position all participants, including elderly ones, in the 
MRI machine safely and comfortably.  However, some older people have a more 
difficult time walking or moving their bodies due to arthritis and other conditions. 
There is a slight chance that these individuals could feel discomfort or fall during 
transitions into or out of the MRI scanner.  The technologist will ensure that the 
walkway to the scanner is safe for you to walk on, will place cushioning on the 
scanner table for your comfort, and will carefully guide your movements around 
the scanner to minimize this risk.
Venous thromboembolism: In some elderly or obese individuals, lying down 
perfectly still for multiple hours can slightly increase the risk that blood clots 
develop in the blood vessels.  These blood clots can be hazardous to your 
health.  The technologist will make every effort to keep your time in the MRI 
machine as short as possible to reduce this risk.  Also, you will have breaks 
during your time in the MRI machine, and during these breaks the technologist

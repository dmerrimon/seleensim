1. Research Questions(s):   Does the administration of intrathecal morphine after delivery reduce the 
risk of post -dural puncture headache (PDPH)  following unintentional dural puncture  (UDP)  with a 
17-g Tuohy needle in obstetric patients?   
 
2. Hypotheses:   Intrathecal morphine  decreases the incidence of PDPH  as compared to placebo  after 
UDP  with a Tuohy needle in obstetric patients.  
 
Background:   Unintentional dural puncture is a known risk of neuraxial techniques, occurring in roughly 
1% of all epi[INVESTIGATOR_254503].1-3  The incidence of PDPH after unintentional dural puncture is 50 -
80%.3-[ADDRESS_309370] one of the following: neck stiffness, tinnitus, hypacusia, photophobia, or nausea.  The headache 
develops within 5 days after dural puncture and resolves either spontaneously within 1 week or within 48 
hours after effective treatment of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_28062] (usually by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_122501]).6  PDPH can be a 
significant cause of maternal morbidity in the obstetric patient.  In addition to interfering with the mother’s 
ability to care for  her newborn, treatment of PDPH can increase health care costs by [CONTACT_254519][INVESTIGATOR_254504].[ADDRESS_309371] to t reat PDPH, but currently there are no proven interventions for preventing or 
reducing the likelihood of PDPH following unintentional dural puncture.8,9 Previously investigated 
strategies include prophylactic epi[INVESTIGATOR_122501], the use of intrathecal (IT) catheter with delayed 
removal,  intrathecal saline injection and infusion,  and cosyntropin administration.10-[ADDRESS_309372] examined the use of intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] t o reduce the incidence of PDPH.14,16  
Recently, one randomized controlled trial  explored the use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_254505]. Al -metwalli showed a decrease in the PDPH rate from 48% to 
12% after administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_75427] [ADDRESS_309373]  unpredictable effects and 
that the use of intrathecal catheters following UDP is a common practice , we feel i t is necessary to study 
the use of intrathecal morphine administration following UDP to decrease the incidence of PDPH .  In our 
randomized prospec tive study, the rates of PDPH following unintentional dural puncture with placement 
of an intrathecal catheter will be compared in two groups:  intrathecal morphine versus intrathecal saline

Significance:   PDPH can lead to significant morbidity.  Alon g with headache, patients may develop cranial 
nerve palsy during the postpartum period leading to permanent disability.  In addition, new mothers are 
unable to bond with their babies due to headache and assoc iated symptoms including nausea, vomiting  and 
limited mobility secondary to pain .  PDPH can negatively impact patient satisfaction with postpartum 
recovery.   Therefore, an effective intervention to decrease the risk of PDPH after UDP would be useful.

IRB# STU00043549  Investigational Plan:  
 
Study design:  prospective, randomized -control led, blinded  study  
 
Methods:  
1. Size of study groups(s):    
The incidence of PDPH has been estimated to  approximately  50% after unintentional dural puncture .[ADDRESS_309380] 50% would be necessary to suggest a clinical utility of this treatment, 
we determined that a sample size of 6 4 patients in each group would be required to achieve an 80% power 
to detect this difference between epi[INVESTIGATOR_254511].  Group sample sizes of 64 achieve 80% 
power to detect a  difference between the group proportions of 0.25. The proportion in group one (the 
treatment  group) is assumed to be 0.5 under the null hypothesis and 0. 25 under the alternative  hypothesis. 
The proportion in group two (the control group) is 0.5. The test statistic used  is the two -sided Fisher's exact 
test. The significa nce level of the test was targeted at  0.05. The significance level actually achieved by [CONTACT_254520] 0.03.   Sample size was calculated using PASS 11, version 11.0.01, release date 11/3/2010 (NCSS 
Inc. Kaysville , UT). To account for protocol exclusions an d patients lost to follow -up, [ADDRESS_309381] will take roughly 1 -2yrs.  
 
2. Patient entry, exclusion and dropout criteria:  
Inclusion :  Postpartum patients  following vaginal delivery  with an unintentional dural puncture and 
functioning intrathecal catheter .  Patients must be 18 years of age or older and English speaking.  
Exclusion:   Previous PDPH , body mass index BMI>40  kg/m2, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) , morphine 
allergy  and patient s who receive Cesarean delivery (as these patients would all receive intrathecal morphine 
and could therefore not be randomized ).   
 
3. Protocol specific methods:   Eligible patients  will be asked by [CONTACT_254521] .  Informed, written consent will be obtained  and the pharmacy on the 10th floor Prentice Women’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254512] .  The patient will be randomized to one 
of two groups:  intrathecal morphine  (treatment)  vs. saline (control)  which will be administered  through the 
existing intrathecal catheter .  Patients randomized to the treatment group  (morphine)  will receive 
preservative -free morphine 0.3 mL (150 mcg) intrathecally .  Those randomized to the control group will 
receive  normal saline 0.[ADDRESS_309382] on the 
10th floor Prentice Women’s Hosptial  and labeled as “IT morphine study drug. ”  The anesthesiologist 
injecting the study drug, the study nurse collecting follow -up data, and the patient will be blinded to group 
assignment. After thoroughly  sanitizing the catheter port with a Chloroprep wipe and allowing adequate 
time for drying of the  Chloroprep, t he anesthesiologist will first attach a [ADDRESS_309383] interventions per the NMH order -set for neuraxial

On postpartum days 1 -5, all patients will be visited daily while inpatient and called by [CONTACT_254522][INVESTIGATOR_307].  The following  information will be also recorded  in this study : presence or absence of 
PDPH  (as defined by [CONTACT_254523]) , signs and symptoms of cranial nerve injury, the 
patient’s verbal rating score for pain  (VRSP, 0 -10 scale) , current headache treatments including oral 
analgesics, intravenous caffeine, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_122501] , side effects of intrat hecal morphine (respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826], nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention .  Patients who develop a headache will be followed 
for 3 days after the resolution of their headache.  Physician observers will make treatment recommendations 
accordin g to the following protocol ( previously described by [CONTACT_254524], 200415):  Mild postural 
head aches (defined as VRSP <4) will be treated with conservative therapy including oral hydration, 
increased oral caffeine intake, and oral analgesics as needed.  Moderate postural headaches (defined as 
VRSP 4 -6 without limitation of childcare ability) will al so receive conservative therapy.  Patients with 
moderate postural headaches limiting childcare abilities, and patients complaining of severe postural 
headaches (defined as VRSP >6) will be advised to undergo a therapeutic epi[INVESTIGATOR_122501]  (EBP) .  This 
treatment will consist of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_254513] [ADDRESS_309384] procedure at NMH.  
 
4. Risks/Benefits:    
Risks to study patients include:  itching, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, cons tipation, dizziness, 
hypotension, depression of cough reflex and slowing of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520] . The rare risk is respi[INVESTIGATOR_254514].   
 
The presumed risks are similar to that assumed by  [CONTACT_254525][INVESTIGATOR_254515], which is common practice.  To minimize the  risk of apnea, patient will be monitored postpartum 
in the same manner that patients receiving neuraxial morphine for Cesarean delivery are routinely 
monitored  as described above .   
 
 If any patient experiences nausea, vomiting or pruritus, she will be treated with medications based on the 
clinical scenario as evaluated by [CONTACT_254526].  There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality.    
 
Confidentiality:  Access to electronic data is computer password protected.  All data will be deleted from 
the password protected computer 5 years after manuscript preparation. Electronic and paper documents will 
be destroyed u sing current technology. The paper documents will be shredded using the current vendor for 
HIPAA sensitive documents using the current technique.  
 
 
Data Analysis:  
1. Data collection form:   Data collection form attached.  
 
2. Data evaluation:   The primary outcome is the incidence of PDPH.  The intrathecal morphine and 
saline groups will be compared using the Fisher ’s exact test.  The clinical characteristics of the study groups 
will be compared between groups using the Mann Whitney test for interval and continuous data and a χ2 
statistic for nominal data. Secondary outcomes include severity of headache, need for epi[INVESTIGATOR_122501], 
rate of neuraxial infection, neuraxial complications.  P < 0.[ADDRESS_309385] the null hypothesis.

IRB# STU00043549  3. Interpretation of Anticipated Results :  A reduced incidence of PDPH in the intrathecal morphine 
group without an unacceptable incidence of side effects would support the effectiveness its administration  
after UDP.  
 
Budget:  
1. Materials:   Preservative free mo rphine (2 -mL) 1000  microgram ampule  – cost 80 cents per vial 
for 64 patients.   Preservative free 0.9% saline (10 -mL) vial – cost [ADDRESS_309386] for study drugs is $74.75, which will be provided by [CONTACT_254527].  
 
2. Labor Requirements:   Obstetric anesthesiology research nurses and obstetric anesthesiology 
fellows will rec ruit patients for the study and will perform all data collection.

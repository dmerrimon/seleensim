Phase 2  
Study Objectives  
For all efficacy objectives and corresponding endpoints listed below, assessment for response and 
disease progression  are according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.[ADDRESS_1106145], unless otherwise noted. 
Primary :  
To evaluate progression- free survival (PFS) in patients treated with intermittent or continuous 
regimens of relacorilant in combination with nab- paclitaxel compared with  patients treated with 
nab-paclitaxel alone. 
Secondary:  
Efficacy  
• To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) in patients with measurable disease at baseline 
treated with intermittent or continuous regimens of relacorilant in combination with nab-paclitaxel compared with patients treated with nab -paclitaxel alone. 
• To evaluate duration of response (D oR) in patients treated with intermittent or continuous 
regimens of relacorilant in combination with nab- paclitaxel compared with patients treated with 
nab-paclitaxel alone. 
• To assess response according to cancer antigen 125 ( CA-125) using Gynecologic Cancer 
Intergroup ( GCIG ) criteria . A combined response endpoint based on both RECIST v1.1 and 
GCIG criteria will also be reported.  
• To evaluate PFS rate at 6 and 12 months in patients treated with intermittent or continuous 
regimens of relacorilan t in combination with nab- paclitaxel compared with patients treated with 
nab-paclitaxel alone. 
• To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients treated with intermittent or continuous regimens of relacorilant in combination with nab -paclitaxel compared with p atients treated with nab -
paclitaxel alone.

following histological subtypes:  
• High grade serous  carcinoma 
• Carcinosarcoma  
• Endometrioid  carcinoma 
Number of Patients Planned  
A total of a pproximately 177 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the 3 treatment arms 
(approximately 59 patients per arm).  
Methodology 
This is a Phase 2, open -label, randomized, 3- arm study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamics , PRO and QoL of continuous and intermittent dosing of relacorilant in combination 
with nab -paclitaxel compared with nab- paclitaxel alone.   
Screening procedures will  be performed within the [ADDRESS_1106146] dose of study treatment .  
Eligible  patients will be randomized 1:1:[ADDRESS_1106147] re cent taxane (relapse within 
6 months vs >6 months ) and presence of ascites (yes vs no).  
• Arm A (con tinuous relacorilant ): relacorilant starting at 100 mg, administered orally, once daily 
every day in combination with nab- paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day 
cycle.  
• Arm B (intermittent relacorilant ): relacorilant 150 mg, administered or ally, once daily on the day 
before  (excluding Cycle 1 Day -1), the day of, and the day after nab-paclitaxel, in combination 
with nab -paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on Days  1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

Confidential  Page  5 • Arm C (comparator): nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, a nd 15 of each 28-day cycle . 
Study treatment will start on Cycle 1 Day 1 in all treatment arms.  
Tumor assessments will be conducted using computerized tomography (CT) with contrast or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. A radiographic tumor assessment  is 
required within [ADDRESS_1106148] dose of study treatment and then every 8 weeks (±7 days) from Cycle [ADDRESS_1106149], for a 30-Day Follow-up Visit .  
Patients who discontinue treatment at any time w ill continue to be followed for s urvival information 
(i.e., the date and cause of death) and subsequent treatment information (i.e., name[s] of subsequent 
therapy regimen [s], dates of initiation and completion, PD on subsequent therapy and response to 
subsequent therap y) during the Long-Term Follow-up.  
• For patients who discontinue treatment before unequivocal PD, subsequent treatment 
information will be collected  at the same time as radiographic tumor assessments (i.e., every 
8 weeks ) until unequivocal PD. After PD, they will be followed every 3 months  for the 
remainder of the Long- Term Follow -up. 
• For patients with PD, or for patients who decline further radiographic tumor assessments, survival and subsequent treatment information will be collected every [ADDRESS_1106150] to follow -up, or other study exit criteria are met  (Section  4.4.2). 
Crossover:  Patients in Arm C (comparator) who experience unequivocal PD per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_1106151] passed since the date of PD and Cycle 1 
Day 1  of the Crossover , then a new baseline radiographic tumor assessment will need to be obtained 
prior to ini tiating  crossover treatment.  Tumor assessments will then be performed every 8 weeks (±7 
days) from the first dose of relacorilant until PD. CA -[ADDRESS_1106152] 12  months. Study procedures will be 
performed according to the schedule for the Treatment Phase; assessments for the Arm C End -of-
Treatment Visit and the Crossover Cycle 1 Day  1 Visit  may be combined into one visit for pa tients in 
Arm C who crossover from nab -paclitaxel to combination treatment (relacorilant 100  mg, administered 
orally, once daily every day starting on Cycle 1 Day 1; in combination with nab- paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on 
Days  1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle).  
Pharmacodynamics/Biomarkers  
Optional p aired tumor biopsies will be obtained within 6 weeks prior to treatment initiation and at 
Cycle 2 D ay 1. A minimum of 6 patients providing biopsies in each of the 3 treatment arms is required. 
If additional patients are  enrolled to achieve this t arget, consent to provide biopsies will become 
Protocol CORT125134- 552
Corcept Therapeutics    Amendment 2  |  23  October 2019  
Confidential  Page  6 mandatory.  Pharmacodynamic  markers will include mRNA gene panel (blood and tumor expression 
profiles), cytokines, cancer  antigens, tumor biomarker assays ( tumor  tissue), and other exploratory 
biomarkers . Additionally, the neutrophil- to-lymphocyte ratio will be evaluated as a pharmacodynamic 
marker from the hematology results . 
Pharmacokinetics  
Intensive PK sampling for relacorilant and nab- paclitaxel will take place on Cycle [ADDRESS_1106153] dose of study treatment 
(relacorilant or nab -paclitaxel, whi chever is earliest). Post -baseline assessments will be collected every 
other cyc le, at the End -of-Treatment Visit, and at the 30-Day Follow-up Visit .  
A detailed description of the study visits and procedures are provided in the schedule of assessments 
(Table  10) and PK (Table  11) and pharmacodynamic ( Table  12) schedules of assessment s. 
Duration of Treatment and Duration of Study  
Patients will receive treatment until  reaching a protocol -defined event of disease progression (PD), 
experiencing unmanageable toxicity, or until other treatment discontinuation criteria are met. All 
patients will be followed for progression, subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (start and end date and response), and survival.
 
Independent Data Monitori ng Committee  
To en sure patient safety, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will evaluate safety data 
(which will include all patients enrolled in the study) after approximately [ADDRESS_1106154] one of the following cri teria:  
• Received 2 cycles of treatment  
• Reached an event of PD  
• Discontinued treatment  due to toxicity  
Subsequent reviews will be based on recommendations from the IDMC, with a minimum frequency of approximately every [ADDRESS_1106155]/Independent Ethics Committee -approved 
informed consent form prior to study- specific screening procedures.  
2. Female patients aged ≥[ADDRESS_1106156] dose of platinum -based therapy (i.e., having a platinum- free interval of ≤ 6 months 
[platinum resistant]) , or progressive  disease during or immediately  after platinum- based 
therapy (i.e., platinum  refractory).  Patients with primary  platinum resistance  (progression  
within [ADDRESS_1106157] -line platinum-containing chemotherapy) are considered 
eligible.   
Notes: For the calculation of the p latinum- free interval, cancer progression must be defined by 
[CONTACT_801376], such as radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1. Calculating the platinum- free interval on the basis of increased CA -125 is not allowed.

Statistical Methods  Analysis Populations 
• Intent- to-Treat (ITT): All randomized patients, analyzed according to the randomized treatment 
arm. This population will be used for analysis of the primary endpoint and all secondary efficacy 
endpoints.

Statistical Analyses 
Time -to-event endpoints will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier estimates and plots.  Even t 
probabilities at 6 -month and 12- month time  point and the median time -to-event (if estimable) will be 
presented. The log- rank test, stratified by [CONTACT_801377](s) used at randomization, will be used 
to compare the treatment groups with respect t o time -to-event variables. Primary estimates of the 
treatment differences will be obtained using the hazard ratios and 1- sided 95% confidence intervals 
from stratified Cox regression models that includes treatment as a covariate and is stratified by 
[CONTACT_801378]. Response rate endpoints will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_801379].

Sample Size  
The assumed median PFS in the current study is 3.8 months in the nab- paclitaxel alone arm (Arm C) 
and 5.4 and 6.8 months, respectively, in Arm B and Arm A. For the comparison between Arm C and 
Arm A, 91 PFS events  will provide approximately 79%  power for a 1-sided log -rank test at a 
0.[ADDRESS_1106168] ratio  [HR]=0.56. Assuming an exponential distribution of 
PFS, this corresponds to an increase in median PFS  from 3.8 months in Arm C to 6.8 months in Arm  A. 
For the comparison between Arm C and Arm B, 92 PFS events will provide approximately 39% power 
for a 1- sided log -rank test at a 0.[ADDRESS_1106169] a HR =0.7. Assuming an exponential 
distribution of PFS, this corresponds to an increase in median PFS from 3.8  mon ths in Arm C to 
5.4 months in Arm B. A total of approximately 177 patients will need to be randomized (1:1:1 ratio), 
assuming approximately 10% drop- out in each study arm.  
Interim Analysis  
No interim efficacy analysis will be performed.  
Patient -Reported O utcomes  and Quality of Life 
For the FACT NFOSI -18, 4 subscale scores will be constructed and analyzed: 1) disease- related 
symptoms (DRS) scores, 2) emotional well -being (DRS- E) score, 3) treatment side effect (TSE) score, 
and 4) a functional well -being (FW B) score. For the primary PRO and  QoL analysis, the overall mean 
change from baseline for the disease -related symptom ( DRS ) scores between groups will be assessed, 
using a longitudinal repeated measures model that takes into account the DRS measured at eac h 
assessment point up to 6 months or PD , whichever is  later.  Additional analyses based upon PRO 
endpoints will be specified in the statistical analysis plan .

For all efficacy objectives listed below, as well as the corresponding endpoints (see Section 3.2), 
assessment for response and disease progression are according to RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_1106183], unless otherwise noted. 
2.1 Primary Objective  
To evaluate progression- free survival (PFS ) in patients treated with intermittent or continuous 
regimens of relacorilant in combination with nab- paclitaxel compared with  patients treated with 
nab-paclitaxel alone.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
2.2.1 Secondary Efficacy Objectives

Confidential  Page  32 3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Overall Design  
This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, 3-arm study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamics, PRO and QoL of continuous and intermittent dosing of relacorilant in 
combination with nab- paclitaxel compared with nab -paclitaxel alone.  
Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:[ADDRESS_1106184] rec ent taxane (relapse 
within 6  months vs >6 months ) and presence of ascites (yes vs no).  
• Arm A (continuous relacorilant): relacorilant starting at 100 mg, administered orally, 
once daily every day , in co mbination with nab- paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 
of each 28- day cycle.   
• Arm B  (intermittent relacorilant ): relacorilant 150 mg, administered orally, once daily on 
the day before (excluding Cycle 1 Day - 1), the day of, and the day after nab -paclitaxel, in 
combination with nab- paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on Day s 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle.  
• Arm C  (comparator): nab- paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day 
cycle.  
The study consists of the following phase s: 
• Screening:  Patients will under go screening procedures within [ADDRESS_1106185] 
dose of study treatment (relacorilant or nab- paclitaxel, whichever is earliest) . 
• Treatment Phase:  Study treatment will start on Cycle [ADDRESS_1106186] v1.1 will be given the opportunity to crossover to the continuous regimen of relacorilant in combination with nab -paclitaxel after discussion with the Medical Monitor 
(Section  3.1.1).  
• 30-Day Follow- up and Post -Treatment Follow -up: Patients will return for a 30 -Day 
Follow-up Visit approximately 30 days after the patient’s fin al dose of study treatment. 
Patients who discontinue treatment prior to disease progression will continue radiographic tumor assessments every 8 weeks (±7 days) until unequivocal PD . 
• Long- Term Follow -up: All patients will be followed after their final dose  of study 
treatment to document survival as well as response/outcomes to subsequent anticancer treatment  (Section  7.6).  
See Figure 1 for an illustration of the study design.

Confidential  Page  33 Figure 1 CORT125134-552 Study Design 
 
 
A detailed description of the study visits and procedures are provided in the schedule of 
assessments ( Table 10 ) and PK ( Table 11) and pharmacodynamic ( Table 12 ) schedules of 
assessments.  
All data will be recorded in an electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Measures of Anticancer Activity 
Tumor assessments will be conducted using computerized tomography (CT) with contrast or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. A radiographic 
tumor assessment  is required within [ADDRESS_1106187] dose of study treatment and then 
every 8 weeks (±7  days) from Cycle [ADDRESS_1106188] v1.1 and GCIG criteria will also be reported.  
Pharmacodynamics/Biomarkers 
Optional paired tumor biopsies will be obtained in this study. For patients who consent to 
provide these, the first tumor biopsy will be collected within 6 weeks prior to treatment initiation 
(this can be the same pre -treatment biopsy used to meet eligibility criteria) and the second tumor 

Protocol  CORT125134- 552
Corcept Therapeutics    Amendment 2  |  [ADDRESS_1106189] to be 
enrolled to achieve this target, consent to provide paired biopsies will become mandatory for 
enrollment in the study.  
Pharmacodynamic markers will include mRNA gene panel (blood and tumor expression 
profiles), cytokines, cancer antigens, tumor biomarker assays (tumor tissue ), and other 
exploratory biomarkers . Additionally, the neutrophil- to-lymphocyte ratio will be evaluated as a 
pharmacodynamic marker from the hematology results.  
Intensive pharmacodynamic sampling ( Table 12) will be performed on a subset of patients, 
comprising at least the first 20 patients enrolled in Arm A  (Section 6.6.1). In order to achieve 
[ADDRESS_1106190] dose of study treatment 
(relacorilant or nab -paclitaxel, whichever is earliest). Post -baseline assessments will be collected 
every other cycle, at the End-of- Treatment Visit, and at the 30- Day Follow-up Visit. To 
minimize bias, PRO and QoL assessments are to be completed prior to discussing the results of tumor assessments or disease- related clinical changes  with the patient (Section  6.7).  
3.1.1 Patient Crossover from Nab-Paclitaxel Treatment  
Patients in Arm C (comparator) who experience unequivocal PD per RECIST v1.1 will be given 
the opportunity to receive the continuous regimen of relacorilant in combination with nab -
paclitaxel after discussion with the Medical Monitor. Patients will receive relacorilant 100  mg, 
administered orally, once daily every day with nab- paclitaxel 80 mg/m
[ADDRESS_1106191] recent radiographic tumor assessment has occurred >28 days from Cycle  1 Day 1 of the Crossover, then a new baseline radiographic tumor assessment will 
need to be obt ained  prior to starting crossover treatment. Radiographic tumor assessments will 
then be performed every 8 weeks (±7 days) from the first dose of relacorilant until PD. CA -[ADDRESS_1106192] 12  months. Study procedures will be performed according to the schedule for the 
Treatment Phase; assessments for the Arm C End -of-Treatment Visit and the Crossover Cycle 1 
Day 1 Visit may be combined into 1 visit for patien ts in Arm C who crossover to combination 
treatment with continuous relacorilant and nab- paclitaxel.

4.3 Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as patients who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not 
subsequently randomized to study treatment.  
A patient who has failed screening  due to a reason that is temporary and expected to resolve 
(e.g., mild intercurrent i nfection) may be re -screened.  
The reason for screen failure should be recorded. 
4.4 Patient Discontinuation of Treatment or Study Completion/Withdrawal 
In this study, patient “disco ntinuation” refers to discontinuation of study treatment. P atients who  
discontinue study treatment will continue to be followed for the study endpoints. This may 
include patients who have discontinued tr eatment due to disease progression, toxicity, 
Investigator decision, or personal decision. These patients will continue with the End -of-
Treatment and 30- Day Follow-up Visits , radiographic tumor assessments ( if disease p rogression 
has not occurred) , and survival assessments.  If a patient wishes to discontinue treatment and 
refuse further study procedures, the patient should be asked if she is willing to continue with 
survival assessments (which can be conducted over the telephone) (Section 7.6). 
Patient study completion  refers to completion of all study procedur es and Long- Term Follow -up 
assessments (Section 3.3.2). Patient “withdrawal” refers to  permanent  withdraw al and c essation 
of all study treatments, procedures, and assessments without further follow-up (withdrawal of 
consent). If a patient wishes to withdraw c onsent to further participation in the study entirely, 
including Long- Term  Follow-up, this should be clearly documented (1) in the patient’s medical 
record and signed by [CONTACT_11219] (2) in the clinical study database (i.e., e CRF).

treatment discontinued, at  any time , at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for safety or 
the inability of the patient to comply with the protocol- required schedule of assessments .  
Reasons for s tudy treatment discontinuation  may include the following:  
• Disease progress ion as defined by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 
• Unacceptable toxicity  
• Adverse event  
• Patient refuses further treatment (follow -up permitted by [CONTACT_102]) 
• The Investigator decides it is in the patient’s  best interest to discontinue treatment and/or 
participation in the study. Reasons may include the following: 
– The patient requires prohibited medications, including a non-protocol-specified 
anticancer therapy  
– The patient is not compliant with protocol requirements

• The p atient is pregnant 
• Any of the criteria listed in Section 4.4.2, as patients who withdraw/complete the study 
will also  discontinue treatment 
Patients who discontinue study treatment early should be encouraged to come to  the clinic for an 
End-of-Treatment Visit, return for a 30 -Day Follow-up Vis it approximately 30 days after the 
patient’s final dose of study treatment ( Table 10), and should report any AEs, including SAEs, 
accordi ng to Section  8.1.2. For patients who elect to discontinue treatment, every effort should 
be made to determine whether the decision to discontinue tre atment  was related to an AE or a 
specific aspect  of the study.  
Patients who discontinue treatment before  unequivocal PD will continue radiographic tumor 
assessments until unequivocal PD, and subsequent treatment information will be collected, every 
8 weeks  (±7 days ) (Section  7.6). For patients with PD, or for patients who decline further 
radiographic tumor assessments, survival and subsequent tr eatment information will be collected 
every 3  months (±7 days) after the last d ose of study treatment. Long- Term Foll ow-up will 
continue until the end point of death, the patient is lost to follow-up, or other study exit criteria are met (Section  4.4.2). 
The date when the patient discontinues treatment and the reason for discontinuation must be recorded on the e CRF.  The Investigator should notify the Sponsor within 48 hours if a patient 
discontinues study treatment.  
For guidelines regarding temporary interruption of treatment or treatment modifications, see 
Section  5.3. 
4.4.2 Patient Withdrawal from Study /Study Completion 
Patients may withdraw voluntarily from the study at any time. As noted above , if a patient 
wishes to withdraw consent to further part icipation in the study entirely , including Long- Term 
Follow-up, this should be clearly documented (1) in the patient’s medical record and signed by [CONTACT_11219] (2) in the clinical study data base (eCRF). If the patient withdraws from the 
study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected.  
Reasons for study exit may include the following medical or administrative reasons:  
• Withdrawal of consent for further follow -up by [CONTACT_801381] 
• Completed study (Section  3.3.2) 
• Adverse event  
• Death  
• Early termination of the study by [CONTACT_1034] 
• Lost to follow-up 
The date the patient is withdrawn from th e study and the primary reason for withdrawal must be 
recorded on the e CRF.  
The Investigator should notify the Sponsor within 48 hours if a patient withdraws from the study.

resume treatment with the next scheduled infusion if appropriate in the judg ment of the 
Investigator. If treatment with nab -paclitaxel is delayed for >4 weeks (omission of 
nab-paclitaxel for >28 days), the Medical Monitor should be notified. 
Nab-paclitaxel dose reductions ( Table 4) should b e made based on observed toxiciti es secondary 
to treatment, as  indicated in Table 3. Sequential dose reductions may be made at the discretion of

For toxicities th at are known risks of nab- paclitaxel, nab -paclitaxel should be preferentially dose 
reduced and relacorilant continued at the current dose level.  
A maximum of 3 dose reductions of relacorilant will be allowed. The minimum dose of 
relacorilant to be administered is 50 mg. In the event that relacorilant is discontinued, treatment

Confidential  Page  50 5.4.3 Management of Signs of Excessive Glucocorticoid Receptor Antagonism 
For patients treated with relacorilant,  signs or symptoms related to excessive GR antagonism 
may develop. If signs and/or symptoms of excessive GR antagonism such as malaise, fatigue, 
lethargy, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, altered mental status, or hypoglycemia are pres ent, particularly if coexistent, treatment with relacorilant should be 
interrupted and the Medical Monitor should be consulted to assist in evaluating whether treatment should continue. If excessive GR antagonism is suspected, standard supportive care (including fluid resuscitation as indicated) and medical therapy should be administered without 
delay. Systemic administration of corticosteroid s should be considered (e.g., dexamethasone 
4 mg daily for 3 days and then tapered by 1 mg per day, or as indicated based on clinical response).  In the event of 
significant trauma or su rgery through [ADDRESS_1106220] supportive care and treatment should be prescribed, as appropriate, to each patient to 
manage disease- related symptoms (e.g., anti-emetics, antibiotics, transfusions, nutritional 
support, and pain control) according to instituti onal guidelines or American Society of Clinical 
Oncology guidelines. Patients do not require and should not receive premedication with dexamethasone prior to nab-paclitaxel infusion, as hypersensitivity react ions are not expected. 
Initial anti- emetic prophylaxis is allowed with ondansetron or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as appropriate, but 
should not include dexamethasone.  
Permitted treatments also include standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_39674].  
Patients must be instructed to notify the investigational site about any new medications they take 
after the start of the study treatment. All medications (other than study treatments) administered 
within [ADDRESS_1106221] dose of study treatment 
(relacorilant or nab -paclitaxel, whichever is earliest) through the 30- Day Follow -up Visit are as 
follows: 
• Warfarin, if  its use cannot be avoided. If used, conduct additional international 
normalized ratio (INR) monitoring.  
• Sulfonylureas. If used, conduct close glucose monitoring to assess for changes in diabetic 
control.

Study treatment will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the schedule of assessments (Table 10).  
Returned study treatment should not be re-dispensed to patient s. 
5.7 Blinding  
This is an open- label study; however, the specific treatm ent to be taken by a patient will be 
assigned using an IVRS/IWRS. The site will use the IVRS/IWRS to register the patient before

6.3 Safety Measures  
Safety will be determined by [CONTACT_100651], AEs, SAEs, all deaths, changes in 
laboratory determinations, and vital sign parameters. Vital signs, laboratory tests, and 
performance status assessment will be performed according  the schedule of assessments 
(Table 10).  
6.3.1 Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
Physical examinations will be performed according to the schedule of assessments ( Table 10).  
A full physical examination will be performed at Screening, Day 1 of each cycle, at the End-of-T reatment Visit, and at the 30-Day Follow-up Visit. A targeted physical examination will 
be performed at Days 8 and 15 (or the day before ) of each cycle. The performance of the 
physical exam ination  will be recorded in the appropriate eCRF by [CONTACT_18370].  
Targeted  physical examinations will include assessment of skin, heart, lungs, and abdomen, in 
addition to symptom- directed assessment of othe r organ systems. Note: all clinically significant 
abnormalities occurring before signature [CONTACT_801407]/or Oncology History section of the eCRF; all abnormalities occurring or worsening 
after signature o f informed consent should be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF.  
Weight will be reported at each visit where a physical examination is performed. Height will be recorded at the Screening Visit only. Height and weight (without shoes) will be measured using 
an appropriate measuring device. Historical patient information and/or patient reports should not 
be used for either measurement.  
Vital signs will be measured as noted in the schedule of assessments ( Table 10) and include 
resting heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature. Systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure will be measured after patients have been at rest (seated) for at least 3 minutes. Blood pressure will be recorded in mmHg. Heart rate (beats per minute) will be measured after 
the patient has been in a resting state (seated) for  at least 3 minutes. H eart rate should be 
recorded over 30 seconds or longer.

The development and improvement of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_16736]. During this study and with the consent of patients (see Section 10.3.1), 
biological samples ( e.g., blood, plasma, serum, or tumor tissue) will be obtained, either  for 
analysis during the study or future analysis. These samples will be used to develop a better 
understanding of the mechanisms of both treatment response (predictive biomarkers) and di sease 
processes (prognostic biomarkers) and ultimately to identify which patients have a high probability to benefit from treatment with relacorilant and those who do not. 
The tests will be conducted  via a central laboratory using a variety of techniques (e.g., 
immunohistochemistry and DNA/RNA analysis). Pharmacodynamic assays may be performed to 
correlate results of biomarker assessments to the physiological effects of relacorilant . A schedule 
of pharmacodynamic assessments, with timing an d frequency of sa mple  collections is provided 
in Table 12.

Blood will be collected by [CONTACT_48571]. Samples are to be obtained pre-dose, fasting, and 
between 7 –9 am at the time points outlined ( Table 12). On Cycle 1 Day 15, samples are to be 
collected in conjunction with the PK time point, if possible. The collection, processing and 
storage should be perform ed as described i n the study- specific manual.  
Intensive sampling is required from a subset of 20 patients (from Arm A only) for RNA analysis at additional time points: Cycle 1 Day 1 ([ADDRESS_1106239]-dose), Cycle 1 Day  2, Cycle 1 Day 3, 
Cycle 1 Day 5, and Cyc le 1 Day 10 ( Table 12).  At a minimum, the first [ADDRESS_1106240] patients who  participate  in the pharmacodynamic sampling. All 
sites/patients will be expected to participate until the Sponsor notifies the sites  that the required 
number of patients  has been reached.  
6.6.[ADDRESS_1106241] -treatment tumor biopsies will be collected within 6 weeks prior to 
treatment initiation an d on Cycle 2 Day 1 (±7- day window) for determination of GR status and 
exploratory biomark ers. While these paired tumor biopsies are optional, a minimum of [ADDRESS_1106242] ed >6  weeks prior to treatment initiation are not allo wed to 
serve as the pre- treatment biopsy .  
For patients in whom fresh tumor biopsy is mandatory for enrollment (because archival tissue is not available) , patients must have at least [ADDRESS_1106243]. 
Samples collected during screening should be fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin (FFPE)  according to standard institutional procedures. Tumor samples should be stored 
according to institutio nal procedures until shipment to the central laboratory. Overfixation in 
formalin for >24 hours should be avoided where possible. While sending FFPE blocks is preferred, slides prepared by [CONTACT_801384]- specific laboratory manual . A minimum of 15 FFPE slides 
will be required for each tumor tissue collection (tissue block preferred). Refer to the study

Confidential  Page  61 6.7 Patient -Reported Outcomes  and Quality of Life  
PRO and  QoL assessments will be performe d according  to the schedule of assessments 
(Table 10). QoL will be assessed using FACT NFOSI- 18 (Jensen et al. 2011), EQ -5D-5 L/VASc  
scales ( EuroQoL 1990), and PROMIS Physical Function-Short Form score ( Cella et al. 2007, 
Rose et al. 2008, Rose et al. 2014). A healthc are utilization questionnaire will also be 
administere d at these visits.  
The FACT NFOSI -18 consists of 18 items and separates disease- related symptoms from 
treatment -related side effects, in 4 subscales: 1)  disease- related symptoms  (DRS)  (9 items), 
2) emo tional well-being (1 item), 3) treatment side -effects (5  items), and 4) functional well-being 
(3 items).  The EQ -5D-5L is a generic preference instrument that has been validated in numerous 
populations. The 5 dimensions of the EQ-5D- 5L (mobility, self -care,  usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) will be measured on a 5- level scale.  The EQ -5D-5L also 
contains a visual analog score (VAS) to assess the patient’s overall health. 
Baseline PRO and QoL assessments will be performed  prior to the first dose of study treatment 
(relacorilant or  nab-paclitaxel, whichever is earliest), at  the Screening Visit. At this visit, patients 
will also be asked to answer the following 2 questions to assess for patient bias that could 
influence the PRO/QoL assessm ents in this open-label study: 
1. Do you expect to have side effects? (Yes/No) 
2. Do you expect to have benefit? (Y es/No)  
Post- baseline assessments will be performed  every other cycle starting with Cycle [ADDRESS_1106244], followed by [CONTACT_20367]-5D-5L. PRO 
and QoL assessments will be completed prior to discussing the results of tumor assessments or disease- related clinical changes with the patient. Pa tients should be encouraged to  respond to all 
of the questions. While the patient is still at the site, the Investigator or designee will need to 
check the forms for completeness. If a patient is not able to complete the forms for any reason, 
this should be documented in the source. If the patient cannot self -administer the forms, the  
forms  can also be administered by [CONTACT_801385] (person- to-person and over the telephone). If 
a patient is not able to come to the site , the questionnaires may be sent with  a request to complete 
them and return to the site as instructed by [CONTACT_7893], or by [CONTACT_37261].

Visits will be conducted on Day 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, starting with Cycle 1 and continuing 
until the End-of- Treatment Visit is complete. The acceptable visit window for scheduling 
conflicts during the Treatment Phase is +1 day for all visits unless the window spans a weekend, 
in which case the acceptable window extends to the following Monday (Day [ADDRESS_1106251] due). This 
acceptable visit window also applies to pharmacodynamic sampling. Visit window s are relative 
to the most recent infusion of nab- paclitaxel ( Appendix C ). Refer to Section 5.4 for delays that 
may occu r due to toxicity. 
Study procedures at each visit will be performed according to the schedule of assessments 
(Table 10).  
A serum or urine pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing potential will be performed 
and reviewed prior to the first dose of study treatment ([ADDRESS_1106252] dose of 
study treatment) and then every 12 weeks ±[ADDRESS_1106253] dose of nab -paclitaxel on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
All patients will receive dosing with nab -paclitaxel  on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. P atients 
receiving relacorilant will also receive their relacorilant dose in the clinic at visits  when  pre-dose 
samples for  PK ( Table 11 ) or pharmacodynamics ( Table 12) are scheduled  to be collected .  
Radiographic tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (±7 days) from Cycle 1 Day 1 
irrespective of treatment delays until unequivocal PD is documented. The same method should be used  for each assessment for a particular patient.  
Availability and consent to provide an archival or recent tumor biopsy (pre -treatment tumor 
biopsy) is required for patient inclusion in the study. For  patients  who consent to provide 
optional paired (pre -treatment and post- treatment) tumor biopsies, biopsies will be obtained 
within 6 weeks prior to treatment initiation (this can be the same pre-treatment biopsy used to meet eligibility criteria) and at Cycle 2 Day 1 (±7 days).  
Pharmacodynam ic sampling will o ccur as described in the schedule provided in Table 12. 
Pharmacodynamic markers will include mRNA gene panel (blood and tumor expression 
profiles), cytokines, cancer antigens, tumor biomarker assays (tumor tissue ), and other

attributes must be assigned:  
1. Description  
2. Dates of onset and resolution 
3. Severity (see Section  8.1.3) 
4. Relationship to study treat ment (see Section  8.1.4) 
5. Seriousness criteria if applicable (see Section 8.2.1) 
6. Action taken  
The Investigator  will actively solicit this information and ass ess the AEs  in terms of severity and 
relationship to each study drug. AEs  (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be 
described using a unifying diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. The Investigator will treat the patient as medically required until the AE either resolves or becomes medically stable. This treatment may extend beyond the duration of the 
study. The Investigator will record treatment and medications required for treatment of the AE 
on the appropriate pages of the eCRF . 
If an AE leads to treatment discontinuation, the corresponding event must be recorded on the End-of-Treatment eCRF  as the reason for treatment discontinuation. In the event that a patient is 
withdrawn from the study be cause of an  AE, the corresponding event must be recorded on the 
End-of-Study eCRF as the reason for discontinuation. 
All AEs considered to be related (see Section 8.1.4) to study treatment and all SAEs will be 
followed unt il resolved or until a stable status has been achieved  (see Section 8.2.2 for details on 
SAE reporting). 
All SAEs that are related to study treatment and unexpected (not reported in the RSI  in the IB or 
if the e vent is of greater severity or frequency than that described in the RSI ) must be reported to 
the governing IRB/IEC as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, local regulations, and the governing health

8.1.3 Severity  
The seri ousness of an AE should not be confused with its severity. To describe the maximum 
severity of the AE on the AE eCRF, the Investigator will use the NCI- CTCAE  criteria v5.0 
(NCI-CTCAE 2017). For events not listed in the NCI- CTCA E, the definitions from th e 
NCI-CTCAE provided in Table 8 should be used to evaluate the grade of severity for the AEs.

8.1.6 Clinical Significance  
The Investigator is responsible for determining whether an AE is clinically significant for the 
patient or the study overall. Clinical sig nificance will be documented in the patient’s medical 
records with the AE information. 
8.1.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
All out-of- range laboratory values will be determined to be clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_737]. An abnormal laboratory value that leads to a dose 
modification /interruption, treatment discontinuation, or patient withdrawal from the study will be 
recorded as an AE on the eCRF. Other clinically significant laboratory values may be reported as 
AEs at the  discretion of the Investigator. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events  
8.2.1 Definition  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following crit eria: 
• Results in death ( i.e., the AE caused or led to the fatality) . 
• Is life -threatening ( i.e., the AE refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death 
at the  time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe) . 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] ( i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46621]/surgical procedures are not SAEs by [CONTACT_46668]) . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ( i.e., the AE results in substantial 
reduction of the patient’s ability to perform activities of daily living). 
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect ( i.e., an adverse finding in a child or fetus 
of a patient exposed to the study treatment before conception or during pregnancy). 
• Involves other medically important conditions ( i.e., the AE does not meet any of the 
above serious criteria but based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the serious outcomes listed in these criteria) . 
Important medical events that might not r esult in death, be life -threatenin g, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed  above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasia or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.

Any SAE occurring during the study period (beginning with informed consent) and for at least 
[ADDRESS_1106261] (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and recorded on the SAE Form. All patients with an SAE must be followed and the outcomes reported. The Investigator must supply the Sponsor and the 
IRB/IEC with any additional requested information (e.g., autopsy reports and terminal 
medical  reports).  
If an SAE results in death, the death should be considered an outcome, not an event. The event or 
condition leading to death should be recorded and reported as a single medical concept on the AE eCRF. Ge nerally, only 1 such event should be r eported. “Fatal” will be recorded as the 
outcome of this respective event; death will not be recorded as a separate event. The eCRF  
should re flect that death was due to an AE with the corresponding reason (e.g., sepsis) 
documented.  
If the primary cause of  death  is PD , the cause of death should be clearly identified on the Death 
eCRF  as progression of the cancer under study. 
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_1106262] 
administration of study treatment (relacorilant or nab -paclitaxel, whichever is latest) must be 
reported to the designated safety contact (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) within [ADDRESS_1106263] . The 
clinical staff will obtain and maintain all pertinent med ical records, information, and medical 
judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the patient within the 
patient files.  
The Investigator or designee will promptly inform the governing IRB/IEC of all serious, 
unexpected, drug-r elated events that occur at his or her site or per the IRB/IEC regulations. It is 
the responsibility of each site to submit Investigational New Drug (IND) Safety Repor ts, as 
applicable, provided to them by [CONTACT_328769] t heir IRB /IEC as required by [CONTACT_32629] B/IEC, local 
regulations, and the governing health authorities. 
The Investigator or designee will fax or email additional follow -up information, if required and  
available, to the contact [CONTACT_708570] 24 hours of receipt. This information should be included

9.1 Analysis Populations 
Analysis populations for this study are: 
• Intent- to-Treat (ITT): All randomized patients, analyzed according to the randomized 
treatment arm. This population will be used for analysis of the primary endpoint and all 
seconda ry efficacy endpoints.  
• Safety Analysis Population (SAF): All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment, analyzed according to the treatment actually received. This population will be used in all analyses of safety endpoints.  
• Pharmacokinetics Analysis Population (PKA): All patients in  the SAF who have PK data 
collected and available for analysis. 
9.2 General Statistical Considerations  
The statistical analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_1052]/or their  designee. Detailed 
descriptions of all analyses and s tatistical methods will be prespecified and documented in a 
Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP) , to be finalized before database lock. 
All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_46637] (as random ized), regardless of the actual

Confidential  Page  74 9.4 Sample Size Calculation 
In order to estimate  the total sample size and the number of events needed in this study, estimates 
of median PFS were considered  from previous studies for the treatment of recurrent or persistent 
platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal cancer. In a single arm study of 
nab-paclitaxel alone ( Coleman et al. 2011), where a major ity of 47 evaluable patients had a 
recurrence within 6 months of treatment completion, the observed median PFS was 4.5 months 
(95% confidence inter val [CI]: 2.2–6.7). In a Phase 3 study of bevaci zumab in combination with 
chemotherapy for platinum- resistant recurrent ovarian cancer  (Pujade- Lauraine et al. 2014), the 
observed median PFS was 3.4 months with chemot herapy alone (95% CI: 2.2–3.7) vs 6.7 months 
with bevacizumab -containing therapy (95% CI: 5.7–7.9).  
Based on these data, the assumed median PFS in the current study is 3.8 months in the 
nab-paclitaxel alone arm (Arm C) and 5.4 and 6.8 months, respectively , in Arm B and Arm A. 
For the comparison between Arm C and Arm A, 91 PFS events  will provide approximately 79% 
power for a 1-sided log- rank test at a 0.[ADDRESS_1106268] ratio  [HR]=0.56. 
Assuming an exponential distribution of PFS, this corresponds to an increase in median PFS 
from 3.8 months in Arm C to 6.8 months in Arm A. For the comparison between Arm C and 
Arm B, 92 PFS events will provide approximately 39% power for a 1- sided log- rank test at a 
0.[ADDRESS_1106269] a HR=0.7. Assuming an exponential distribution of PFS, this corresponds to an increase in median PFS from 3.8 months in Arm C to 5.4 months in Arm B. A total of approximately 177 patients will need to be randomized (1:1:1 ratio), assuming approximately 10% drop-out in each study arm.  
The total accrual duration is expected to be 24 months, with expected study duration of 
43 months. 
Assuming a median survival of 13.3 months in the control group, and 16.6 and 17.4 months in 
Arms B and A, respectively, approximately 120 OS events can be expected to be observed during the 43 months of study duration. This will provide 33% global power for the comparison of time to OS among the [ADDRESS_1106270] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables.

Procedural Window Note: Screening hematology and chemistry laboratory tests can be used for the Cycle [ADDRESS_1106295] 
dose of study treatment. For all other visits, hematology and chemistry assessments c an be conducted up to 72 hours prior  to the study visit/nab -paclitaxel 
infusion. Post-baseline PR O and QoL assessments can be performed up to 7 days early.  
a. Patients who discontinue treatment prior to disease progression will continue radiographic tumor assessments every 8 weeks (±7  days) until unequivocal 
disease progression.  
b. Follow -up Visit sh ould be performed 30 days (±3 days) after the patient receives their final dose of study treatment ( relacorilant or nab -paclitaxel, whichever is 
latest). 
c. Long-Term Follow -up: For patients who discontinue before PD,  subsequent treatment  information  will be collected at the same time as radiographic tumor 
assessments (i.e., every 8  weeks [±7  days]), until unequi vocal PD, after which they will be followed  every 3 months (±7  days). For patients who discontinue 
treatment at the time of PD, or for those who decline further radiographic tumor assessments, survival and subsequent treatment inf ormation will be collected 
every 3 months (±7 days) from  the last dose of stu dy treatment (Section 7.6 ).  
d. A serum or urine pregnancy test for fema le patients of childbearing potential will be performed prior to the first dose of study treatment ([ADDRESS_1106296] dose of study treatment) and then every 12 weeks ±7 days.  
e. Availability and consent to provide an archival or recent (pre -treatment) tumor biopsy for biomarkers  are required for patient inclusion in the study. Optional 
paired tumor biopsies will be obtained within 6 we eks prior to treatment initiation (this can be the same pre- treatment biopsy used to me et eligibility criteria) 
and at Cycle [ADDRESS_1106297] dose of study treatment and then every 8 weeks (±7 days) from Cycle  1 Day  1 
irrespective of treatment delays until unequivocal disease progression is documented, including in patients who prematurely discontinue therapy. The same

The following should be considered when determining a diagnosis of high grade serous 
carcinoma:  
• Diagnosed as Grade 2 or Grade 3 serous carcinoma using Shimizu-Silverberg grading 
scheme.  
• Wide spectrum of architectural patterns, including solid, glandular, and cribriform patterns, and patterns resembling transitional cell carcinoma. At least focal papi[INVESTIGATOR_801372]- like architectural features are present.  
• Histologic variants such as transitional cell carcinoma or serous carcinoma with 
microcystic features.  
• High nuclear grade, with extreme nuclear size variability (>5 ×). 
• More  than 10 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields. 
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_801373]. WT1 expression should be sought for Stage I 
tumors. 
• WT1, p53, and/or pl6 overexpression may be sought if the differential diagnosis includes low grade serous carcino ma, endometrioid carcinoma, or clear cell carcinoma.  
• Can be distinguished from serous borderline tumor by [CONTACT_801403].  
 
Protocol CORT125134- 552

Confidential  Page  96 Appendix C : General Chemotherapy Guidelines  
• A patient will be permitted to have a new cycle of chemotherapy delayed up to 7 days 
(without this being considered to be a protocol deviation) for major life events (e.g., serious illness in a family member, major holiday, vacation which is unable to be re-scheduled). Documentation to justify this decision should be provided. 
• It will be acceptable for nab -paclitaxel doses  to be delivered within a 1-day window after 
the scheduled date of treatment, except if the treatment due date is a Friday. In that case, if the patient cannot be treated on the Friday, then the acceptable window for treatment would include the following Monday (Day [ADDRESS_1106304] due).  For example:  
 “Day 8 chemotherapy” can be delivered on Day 8 or Day 9, unless Day 9 is a Saturday and then Day 8 chemotherapy can be delivered on Day 11 
 “Day 15 chemotherapy ” can be given on Day 15 or Day 16, unless Day 16 is a 
Saturday and then Day 15 chemotherapy can be delivered on Day 18 
• Chemotherapy doses can be “rounded” according to institutional standards without being considered a protocol deviation (most institutions use a rule of approximately ±5% of the calculated dose).  
• Chemotherapy doses are required to be recalculated if the patient has a weight change of greater than or equal to 10%. Patients are permitted to have chemotherapy doses recalculated for <10% weight  changes.

Confidential  Page  99 Appendix E: RECIST v 1.[ADDRESS_1106306] v1.1 is described below. This appendix is 
not exhaustive and the source ( Eisenhauer 2009) should be referred to for further detail.  
Measurement of Lesions  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using ca lipers if clinically assessed. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used t o characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estima te the size of the lesion is 
suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_51752], 
imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study. 
CT is the best cur rently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. CT (with IV and oral contrast) should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_1106307]  1 dimension (longest diameter in the plane 
of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
• [ADDRESS_1106308]/MRI scan (slice thickness no greater 
than 5 mm). 
• [ADDRESS_1106309]/MRI scan (slice thickness no greater than 
5 mm)  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable).  
Non-measurable Tumors  
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as  well as truly non -measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly 
non-measurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415].

Confidential  Page  100 Special Considerations Regarding L esion M easurability  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment: 
Bone Lesions: 
• Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imag ing techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic- blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, 
that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_801404]. 
• Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
Cystic Lesions:  
• Lesions that meet the cr iteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither mea surable nor non- measurable) since they are, 
by [CONTACT_108], simple c ysts. 
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can  be considered as  measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition  of measurability described above. However, if 
non-cystic  lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred  for sel ection as 
target lesions.  
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated  
progression in the lesion.  
Tumor Response Evaluation 
Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.  
Patients with measurable or non- measurable disease are eligible. Me asurable disease is defined 
as above, by [CONTACT_76478]  1 measurable lesion.  
Baseline Do cumentation of ‘Target’ and ‘Nontarget’ Lesions 
When more than  1 measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of 
5 lesions total (and  a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as ta rget lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected. 
Protocol CORT125134- 552
Corcept Therapeutics    Amendment 2  |  23  October 2019  
Confidential  Page  101 Response criteria as defined below should be used: 
• Evaluation of Target Lesions 
– Complete  Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm.  
– Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters (SOD) of target lesions,  taking as reference the baseline SOD.  
– Progressive Disease / Disease Progression  (PD): At least a 20% increase in the SOD 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of  1 or more new lesion s. In addition to the relative increase 
of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an a bsolute increase of at least 5  mm. The 
development of unequivocal new lesions (not attributed to differences in scanning technique, imaging modality, or flare/healing of pre- existing lesions) will also be 
considered PD. 
– Stable Disease (SD): Neither suffici ent shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking a s reference the smallest SOD since the treatment 
started.  
• Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions  
– Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the a ctual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be z ero 
even if CR criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a s hort 
axis of <10 mm.  
– All lesions at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (<5 mm). If the lesion is be lieved to be 
present, but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (as derived from the [ADDRESS_1106310] slice thickness). If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  
• Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions  
– Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. 
– Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (non -CR/non- PD): Persistence of  1 or more 
nontarget lesion(s) or/and maintenanc e of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits.  
– Progressive Disease / Disease Prog ression  (PD): Appearance of  1 or more new 
lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions. 
• Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Nontarget Disea se 
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the nontarget disease, ther e must be 
an overall level of substantial worsening in nontarget disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest increase in the size of  1 or more nontarget 
lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal disease prog ression.  In the 
Protocol CORT125134- 552
Corcept Therapeutics    Amendment 2  |  23  October 2019  
Confidential  Page  102 absence of radiographic or clinical evidence of progressive disease, a rise in CA -125 
alone is not sufficient to declare progression.  
New lesions  
• The appearance of new lesions denotes disease progression. The findings of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal; i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, timing 
of scanning, phase of contrast administration, change in imagining modality, or finding thought to represent something other than tumor. A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  
• If a new lesion is equivocal, continue therapy and follow- up evaluation will clarify if it 
represents new disease. If repeat  scans confirm there is a new lesion, then progression 
should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

To calculate CA -125 responses accurately, the following rules apply: 
• Intervening samples and the 28-day confirmatory sample must be less than or equal to 
(within an assay variability of 10%) t he previous sample. 
• Variations within the reference range of CA -125 levels will not interfere with the 
response definition. 
• For each patient, the same assay method must be used, and the assay must be tested in a 
quality control scheme. 
• Patients are not evaluable by [CONTACT_28474] -[ADDRESS_1106313] received  mouse antibodies (unless the 
assay used has  been shown  not to be influenced by [CONTACT_801405]) or if t here 
has been medical and/or surgical interference with  their peritoneum or pleura during the 
previous 28 days (e.g., paracentesis). If assessing therapy that includes 2 treatment  
modalities for relapse (e.g., surgery and chemotherapy), any CA -[ADDRESS_1106314] reduced by 50% is the date of the CA-[ADDRESS_1106315] Overall Response in Patients without Initial Measurable Disease  and 
Evaluable by [CONTACT_28474]-125 (GCIG  Criteria ) 
CA-125 may be used to evaluate response in patients without initial measurable disease either 
because no measurable disease is evident on radiological imaging or because appropriate 
imaging has not been perf ormed as demonstrated in Table 13.

Confidential  Page  107 Appendix G: Guidance for Counting Prior Lines of Therapy  
The following guidance applies with respect to counting the number of prior lines of anticancer 
therapy for each patient: 
• Line of therap y includes therapy that was given in any setting (adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
treatment or for recurrent disease).  
• If a treatment was initiated after disease progres sion or discontinuation of a previous 
regimen due to toxicity, then the treatment should be considered a separate line of 
therapy, with exception of the following: 
– If 1 component of a regimen/planned treatment duration was transitioned to a similar 
class/r egimen due to toxicity, then the continuation of doublet therapy should be 
considered as  1 line  of therapy . For example, adjuvant treatment with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel, with a change from paclitaxel to docetaxel after 3  cycles due to toxicity, to 
complete the planned 6 cycles of treatment, would be considered 1 line of therapy. Similarly, if the  same patient received maintenance treatment with bevacizumab 
following completion of carboplatin and paclitaxel/docetaxel, all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_801375]  1 line of therapy . 
• If a patient completed a planned course of treatment, subsequent treat ments should be 
considered as a new line of therapy. 
• Maintenance therapy is not considered a separate regimen and should be counted as part of the line of therapy most recently completed.

I. Purpose, Background and Rationale A. Aim and Hypotheses   This will be an open-label trial to describe the effects of cryoneurolysis with iovera on symptom relief in patients with painful Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2–4 ankle osteoarthritis (OA). The Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) subscales will be used to assess outcomes at 6, 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. The aim of this study is to assess clinically significant long-term symptomatic relief with cryoneurolysis in people with unilateral ankle osteoarthritis (OA).  Depending on the location of pain, we will treat either 1) the Superficial Fibular Nerve (SFN), Sural Nerve (SN) and Saphenous Nerve or 2) the deep fibular nerve with cryoneurolysis using the iovera device. The primary study endpoint, clinically significant improvement in pain 12 weeks after each treatment, will be assessed using the FAOS-Pain subscale. The secondary outcomes will be improvement in quality of life (FAOS-QoL), activities of daily living (FAOS-ADL) and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain. The tertiary outcome will be improvement in physical performance measures (40m fast-paced walking test, Standing Balance Test). We hypothesize that people with painful ankle OA will experience significant improvement in pain, activities of daily living, quality of life and physical performance for at least [ADDRESS_535763] of care therapy (i.e. corticosteroid injection).1,2  Specific Aim 1: To determine the extent of pain relief after cryoneurolysis of nerves innervating the ankle joint in patients with ankle osteoarthritis. Primary Hypothesis 1: Cryoneurolysis of nerves innervating the ankle joint in patients with ankle OA results in reduction in ankle pain (FAOS-Pain) detectable at the following post-treatment time points:  a) 6 weeks b) 12 weeks (primary outcome) c) 24 weeks  
 
KUMC – HRPP- 03/12/2015  Page 2 of 19   Specific Aim 2: To determine the extent of improvement in activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QOL) after cryoneurolysis of nerves innervating the ankle joint in patients with ankle osteoarthritis.  Hypothesis 2a: Cryoneurolysis of nerves innervating the ankle joint in patients with ankle OA results in improved ADL (FAOS-ADL) detectable at the following post-treatment time points:  a) 6 weeks b) 12 weeks  c) 24-weeks Hypothesis 2b: Cryoneurolysis of nerves innervating the ankle joint in patients with ankle OA results in improved QOL (FAOS-QOL) detectable at the following post-treatment time points:  a) 6 weeks b) 12 weeks  c) 24-weeks   Specific Aim 3: To determine the extent of improvement in physical performance measures (40m fast-paced walking test and Standing Balance Test) after cryoneurolysis of nerves innervating the ankle joint in patients with ankle osteoarthritis.   Hypothesis 3a: Each cryoneurolysis treatment results in improved physical performance detectable at the following post-treatment time points: a) 6 weeks b) 12 weeks  c) 24-weeks   B. Background and Significance  Approximately 15% of the world’s adult population is affected by [CONTACT_424047] (OA), and approximately 1% have OA of the ankle. There has been substantial clinical and basic science research related to hip and knee OA. However, research related to ankle OA is sparse.[ADDRESS_535764]-traumatic. Traumatic ankle injuries that may result in OA include fractures of the malleoli, tibial plafond, talus, isolated osteochondral damage of the talar dome, and ankle ligament injuries.  OA of the ankle (tibiotalar) joint progresses from early damage to diffuse and severe degeneration and deformity of the joint. The leading causes include trauma, ischemia, abnormal ossification, and genetic predisposition. Although trauma is probably the most common cause of injury and degeneration of the ankle (70% of reported cases), repetitive microtrauma could also be a contributing factor. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_424032], the rate of symptomatic and disabling OA is lower than that of the hip and knee, due to the different biologic and biomechanical characteristic of the cartilage and subchondral bone at the ankle4.  Pharmacologic and surgical therapeutic options for ankle osteoarthritis are limited. Treatments have traditionally consisted of temporizing measures such as physical therapy and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral and intra-articular pharmaceutical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424033] – HRPP- 03/12/2015  Page 3 of 19   or arthroplasty is required. Cryoneurolysis is a specialized technique for providing long-term pain relief in interventional pain management settings5. Treated nerves are temporarily blocked from transmitting pain signals, followed by [CONTACT_424048] a time period.   Using cryoneurolysis in patients with ankle OA could potentially provide immediate symptomatic relief with a greater duration of analgesia and a lower rate of side effects than other non-operative treatments. These potential benefits could reduce the need for both clinic and injection visits when compared to other treatment modalities, thereby [CONTACT_424049].  The iovera° device is 510(k)-cleared (K133453 and K161835) and is used to destroy tissue during surgical procedures by [CONTACT_12789] a precisely controlled, sub-dermal cold zone. It can also be used to produce lesions in peripheral nervous tissue by [CONTACT_12789] a precise cold zone of -20 to -88.5 degrees Celsius to temporarily disrupt peripheral nerve function, ultimately blocking pain.1 It is also indicated for the relief of pain and symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee for up to 90 days. The iovera° system is not indicated for treatment of central nervous system tissue.  The iovera° device uses liquid nitrous oxide (N2O) that is contained within the handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. This pressurized liquid travels from the hand-pi[INVESTIGATOR_424034]-end needles of the smart tip, where it undergoes a phase change, forming a precise cold zone. The gaseous nitrous oxide is expelled out of the hand-pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], leaving nothing behind in the body. This treatment causes a temporary nerve block based on a process called Wallerian degeneration or 2nd -degree nerve injury. This degeneration affects the axon and myelin sheath while leaving the surrounding nerve components intact such as the endoneurium, perineurium or epi[INVESTIGATOR_424035] 1. When sensory nerves are treated, their ability to convey sensory signals, such as pain, is immediately interrupted.   
  Figure 1 

 
KUMC – HRPP- 03/12/[ADDRESS_535765] on the nerve is temporary. The duration of the pain relief depends on the individual and the location of the nerve being treated. In general, nerves regenerate at a rate of approximately 1.0-1.5mm per day.6 Therefore, we hypothesize a duration of relief of ankle pain of approximately 90 days.  Preliminary Data: A recent randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter trial (17 sites) with a 6-month follow-up was conducted in 180 patients with mild-to-moderate knee OA. This study demonstrated that a single treatment of the infrapatellar branches of the saphenous nerve with iovera° resulted in a reduction in the pain and symptoms for at least 90 days.1 Compared to the sham group, patients who received iovera° treatment had a statistically significant greater change from baseline in the WOMAC pain subscale score at Day 30 (p=0.0004), Day 60 (p=0.0176), and Day 90 (p=0.0061) post-treatment. Patients deemed WOMAC pain responders at Day [ADDRESS_535766] expected side effects were mild in severity and resolved within 30 days. The incidence of device- or procedure-related adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups with no occurrence of serious or unanticipated adverse device effects (ADE).  This clinical trial will be the first to systematically evaluate the symptomatic and functional benefits of cryoneurolysis for patients suffering from painful ankle OA. Patients are more likely to seek medical care when they are experiencing symptoms, have reduced activity and/or functional limitation. Therefore, finding that an affordable, safe treatment could alleviate symptoms and improve activities of daily living while avoiding the side effects of pharmacological and surgical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], holds promise to improve quality of life and reduce health care expenditures.   iovera° Device and Treatment Procedure  The iovera° device consists of a reusable, portable hand-pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], along with a single-patient use sterile smart tip, or cryoprobe, and disposable nitrous oxide (N2O) cartridges. The smart tip contains embedded software that manages procedure parameters and provides physician feedback throughout all stages of device preparation, treatment and post-treatment via communication with the hand-pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].  The hand-pi[INVESTIGATOR_424036].  The cryogen is provided in a nitrous oxide cylinder attached to a custom filter, known as the cartridge.  To remove contaminants that may be present in the cylinder, a custom filter is added to the cylinder to filter the liquid nitrous oxide before it enters the hand-pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].  This ensures optimal performance of the device.  There are 2 types of smart tips (including their respective variants) that we will be utilizing with this study, depending on the depth of the nerves being treated. The shorter smart tip comes in 2 variants - composed of either three 6.9 mm or three 8.9 mm, 27-gauge needles. It has an attached skin warmer to prevent damage to the underlying skin from sub-zero temperatures. The longer smart tip also comes in 2 variants - composed of a 22-gauge single needle measuring 55 mm or a 20G single needle measuring 90 mm and it will be used to treat nerves not accessible by [CONTACT_424050]. The iovera° device produces the desired effect through the initiation of a cooling cycle that lasts for 60 seconds. Each cooling cycle is initiated by [CONTACT_424051]. As the cryogen gas travels through the length of the needle, an ice ball develops around the needle causing the surrounding tissue to be frozen. Operation instructions and further details on the device are in the User Guide provided by [CONTACT_78702].   
 
KUMC – HRPP- 03/12/2015  Page 5 of 19    C. Rationale The cryoneurolysis mechanism of action is well-understood and established in prior studies.5 Results of a recent study demonstrate that cryoneurolysis can alleviate the pain and symptoms of knee OA for up to 90 days1.  Pharmacologic and surgical options for ankle OA are limited. Using cryoneurolysis in patients with ankle OA could potentially provide immediate symptomatic relief with a greater duration of analgesia and a lower rate of side effects. These potential benefits could reduce the need for both clinic and injection visits when compared to other available treatment modalities, thereby [CONTACT_424049].  II. Research Plan and Design  A. Study Objectives: The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cryoneurolysis for improving ankle symptoms and function. Specifically, this study will measure changes in pain, activities of daily living, quality of life and physical performance at 6, 12 and 24 weeks after each superficial and deep treatment.   B. Study Type and Design:  This is a single-site, open-label study of participants with painful ankle OA assigned to undergo cryoneurolysis of either the Superficial Fibular Nerve (SFN), Sural Nerve (SN) and Saphenous Nerve, or the Deep Fibular Nerve (DFN) using ultrasound-guided cryoneurolysis. Subjects will initially undergo diagnostic nerve blocks using 1% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_424037].   We will evaluate responder status with NRS at clinic visits 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks following treatment as well as NRS via web-form or phone calls (per subject preference) at 3, 9 and 18 weeks. “Non-responders” being defined as anyone reporting less than 20% pain relief with respect to their baseline NRS scores. For subjects who become non-responders, we will treat the other nerve group with iovera at their next clinic visit (e.g. if a subject becomes a non-responder 9 weeks after superficial nerves are treated, then at 12 week follow-up, the participant will be offered treatment of the deep fibular nerve).  Figure 2 depi[INVESTIGATOR_424038].  FAOS (Pain, ADL, QoL), NRS for pain and physical performance tests ([ADDRESS_535767]) will be assessed at baseline and 6, 12, and [ADDRESS_535768]-treatment will monitor subjects using the NRS pain scale.7 Electronic data capture will be used for this study. Adverse events will be monitored at each telephone call and follow-up visit. There will be a grace period of 21 days between the screening and treatment visit. There is a +/- 3-day window for follow-up visits. During the time period of March to May, 2020(depending on duration of suspension of non-essential research), we are modifying the protocol to conduct virtual study visits to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The following data points will be or will not be collected during this time as per the individual circumstance: 40mFPWT or Standing Balance test at [ADDRESS_535769] the 6 week, 12 week and 24 week f/u visit remotely for each treatment arm as per KU essential research guidelines. We will also offer participants masks, gloves, and complete the f/u visit at the

KUMC – HRPP- 03/12/2015  Page 7 of 19   C. Sample size and power calculation In this open-label study, participants will undergo cryoneurolysis using iovera. FAOS (Pain, ADL, QoL), NRS for pain and physical performance tests (40m fast-paced walking test and Standing Balance Test) data will be collected at baseline and 6, [ADDRESS_535771] of care and long-term effects. A control group will not be included in this initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Differences between each of the three follow-up time points and baseline will be assessed using one-sample t-tests or repeated measures analyses, as appropriate, controlling for study-wide alpha level to account for multiple comparisons as well as 6-week and 24-week analyses.  A FAOS validation study, completed by S.B.Mani et al., confirmed that some FAOS sub-scales (i.e. pain, activities of daily living and quality of life) are valid for independent use. According to the study, the effect size for FAOS pain and quality of life is 1.06, whereas for activities of daily living there is an effect size of 0.65. At an effect size of 0.65 and a single-sized alpha of 0.025, a sample size of 32 would provide a power of 90%. While 80% power is customary, it would be desirable to plan for 90% to reduce the probability of missing an effect if one is present and to provide sufficient power for comparisons at 2-time points. Assuming up to 20% dropout, we plan to recruit [ADDRESS_535772] Criteria (See Vulnerable Populations appendix, if applicable):  Enrollment will be comprised of 40 subjects, age 18 and over with symptomatic ankle OA.

Assessment of Subject Safety and Development of a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  Compliance reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a weekly basis.  Reports containing the proportion of subjects completing the intervention or prematurely terminating participation will be generated monthly. Adverse event information will be collected during all contacts with subjects.  If an adverse event is reported to study staff, data including the type of event, onset/end dates, duration, severity, and outcome will be collected and reported to the Principal Investigator, who will determine severity of the event using CTCAE guidelines.  Post-treatment expected symptoms include numbness of the skin over the ankle and foot and possibly redness, swelling, bruising or pain at the site of insertion.    An event that is serious must be recorded on the AE worksheet and requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements.  Any adverse events classified as “serious” by [CONTACT_424054] [ADDRESS_535787] Participation  A. Recruitment: 
 
KUMC – HRPP- 03/12/[ADDRESS_535788] will participate for up to 24 weeks following either deep or superficial nerve treatment. Enrollment is expected to take up to 6-12 months following (superficial or deep nerve) treatment. Total study duration is expected to be up to 18 months.  B. Screening Interview/questionnaire: Potential subjects who express interest in the study will be screened by [CONTACT_756]. A script will be used to determine eligibility for the first screening clinic visit by [CONTACT_464]. Please see Appendix II. C. Informed consent process and timing of obtaining of consent Subjects who pass the initial screening criteria (telephone screen) will be asked to schedule a screening visit to provide written consent and possibly undergo screening procedures during a screening visit. Subjects will be informed that the study is voluntary and choosing not to participate will not affect their current treatment. They may request the opportunity to review the consent form with their physician and/or family members.  Moreover, they will be fully informed of the purpose of the study and of the possible risks involved before providing their consent. Written, informed consent will be obtained and documented by [CONTACT_424055] a study coordinator prior to initiation of study procedures.  All subjects will be provided with a copy of the signed consent form.   D. Alternatives to Participation: The alternative to study participation is choosing not to participate and continue with their current treatment plan. E. Costs to Subjects: There will be no cost to subjects to participate in the study and no insurance will be billed as a part of the study procedures. F. How new information will be conveyed to the study subject and how it will be documented: If any new information is to be provided to the study subject the informed consent form (ICF) will be amended and approved by [CONTACT_1201].  Each subject will then be reconsented using the newest revision of the ICF. G. Payment, including a prorated plan for payment:  Subjects would be provided $25 at each visit that they attend (up to $200 per participant) as compensation for their time. They additionally will be provided with parking validation for in-person visits. Moreover, participants will be provided with encouragement during the study period, especially prior to and after each study visit through letting them know that their contributions are appreciated.   H. Payment for a research-related injury:  If the subject is injured because of study participation, there will be no compensation for physical or non-physical injuries. will be available for any extra expenses that may be the result of Research-related physical injuries include additional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_260814], lost wages, travel 
 
KUMC – HRPP- 03/12/2015  Page 18 of 19   expenses, etc.  No compensation will be available for any non-physical injuries that may occur because of research participation, such as legal problems, problems with your finances or job, or damage to your reputation.  IV. Data Collection and Protection A. Data Management and Security:  FAOS (Pain, ADL, QoL), NRS for pain and physical performance test ([ADDRESS_535789]) data will be collected at baseline and 6, [ADDRESS_535790] available to the study team. Analyses will be performed on coded files.  Physical files (e.g. questionnaires) will be stored in locked file cabinets in the research office.    B. Sample / Specimen Collection: N/A C. Tissue Banking Considerations: N/A  D. Procedures to protect subject confidentiality:  Data regarding subjects’ demographic, ankle radiographs or cone-beam CT, FAOS responses will be obtained directly from subjects.  All data will be coded, with no information that could identify a subject.  A master list with patient information and assigned study IDs will be stored in a separate password-protected file on a password-protected research drive available to the study team. Analyses will be performed on coded files. Physical files (e.g. questionnaires) will be stored in locked file cabinets in the research office.  E. Quality Assurance / Monitoring Study staff will have proper qualifications for data entry and will receive training in data entry procedures to insure data entered is of highest quality research staff. Data will be entered into two separate databases by [CONTACT_424056].  The two databases will be reconciled by [CONTACT_424057].  Data will be backed-up daily.  V.Data Analysis and Reporting A. Statistical and Data Analysis:   All participants will be assigned to undergo cryoneurolysis using iovera. FAOS (Pain, ADL, QoL), NRS for pain and physical performance test ([ADDRESS_535791]) data will be collected at baseline, [ADDRESS_535792] of care and long-term effects, while minimizing the variability that may occur further out from baseline. Differences between each of the three follow-up time points for each of the interventions (superficial and deep) and baseline will be assessed using one-sample t-tests or repeated measures analyses, as appropriate. This will control for study-wide alpha level to account for multiple comparisons as well as 6-week and 24-week analyses. A soft-lock of the database will occur after the 6- and 12-week time-points.    
 
KUMC – HRPP- 03/12/2015  Page 19 of 19    B. Outcome: We expect statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in pain, activities of daily living, quality of life and physical performance with iovera° in people with ankle OA at [ADDRESS_535793]-treatment.  C. Study results to participants: The study will be registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov and results posted upon completion of the study. D. Publication Plan: Results will be submitted for presentation at an appropriate conference and for publication in an appropriate journal for the topic of study.  VI.

1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study  Design  
 
This is a Phase 2 study with a randomized lead -in phase of nivolumab in combination with 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482445] (RAI) refractory, aggressive thyroid cancer, with exploratory 
cohorts in medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer. The medullary cohort  will be randomized 
(along with patients with differentiated thyroid cancer), but in the anaplastic cohort, there will be 
no randomization. Due to the aggressive nature of anaplastic thyroid cancer, patients with 
anaplastic disease will receive nivolumab a nd ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482446].

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.[ADDRESS_619642] common cancer in the [LOCATION_002]. In 2014, it was estimated 
that nearly 63,000 Americans will be diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and nearly 1,900 will die of 
the disease. The overall  incidence of thyroid cancer in the [LOCATION_002] has i ncreased in people 
of all racial/ethnic groups and in both males and females over the past several decades.  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619643]. 
5  
 Thyroid cancer incidence rates vary by [CONTACT_482528], with incidence being nearly three  
times higher in women than in men and near ly twice as high in whites as in African Americans. 
After whites, Asians/Pacific islanders have the second highest incidence. Overall  mortality  rates 
remain low despi[INVESTIGATOR_482448] 0.8% annually from [ADDRESS_619644] DTC cases are usually cured with surgery, radioactive iodine (RAI), and thyroid hormone 
suppression therapy. Papi[INVESTIGATOR_6686] (PTC) is t he most frequent type of thyroid cancer. 
Most people who develop thyroid cancer are between age 25 and 65 years.  The prognosis is 
generally good; however, 7 –23% of patients, distant metastases develop and further treatment 
with RAI can eradicate the diseas e in only one third of such cases, while two thirds develop 
radioiodine refractory (RAIR) disease. The 10 –year survival rate among patients with RAIR  
DTC  is only 10% (1). Currently,  only two multi -targeted  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  (TKI)  have 
U.S. Food an d Drug Administration (FDA) approval for progressive DTC based on improved 
PFS compared to placebo in two large phase 3 studies. Sorafenib demonstrated a 5 -month 
improvement in median PFS versus placebo (10.8 versus 5.8 months) in a phase 3 trial of 447 
RAIR TC patients  who had progressed  within  14 months  prior  to enrollment  (2). Lenvatinib,  also 
demonstrated a significant improvement in median PFS compared to placebo (18 months versus 
3.6 months) in a phase 3 trial of 330 RAIR TC patients who had progressed in the prior 13 
months (3). Remarkably, neither study showed a survival benefit for th e patients on the 
experimental arm except for those age 65 and older (4). Crossover was allowed in these studies.  
 
Recent data suggests that PD -1 and PD -L1 are over -expressed in thyroid cancer and the amount 
of PD -L1 expression appears to correlate with pr ognosis.  
 
The PD -1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has been tested in a phase I study that included 22 patients 
with PD-L1 positive  metastatic  thyroid  cancer  (5). Eighteen  of these  patients  had previously  been 
treated  with radioiodine  and were  considered  RAI refra ctory.  Two out of 22 patients  had a partial 
response (9.3%).  
 
The goal of this study  is to determine  response  rate in patients  with RAI refractory  thyroid  cancer 
that is incurable.  
 
Medullary  Thyroid  Cancer  
Medullary thyroid cancer constitutes approximately 2% of cases diagnosed with thyroid cancer 
and is derived from parafollicular C -cells. While it may not progress even as metastatic disease 
for many years, most patients enter an accelerated disease phase a nd require medical treatment. 
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors Vandetanib and Cabozantinib are FDA approved for this disease  
based on randomized phase [ADDRESS_619645] demonstrated efficacy of PD -1 or CTLA -4 directed therapy 
has been published.  
 
This study will include an exploratory cohort of 7 patients with medullary thyroid cancer  with 
any number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including first line in this patient population without the RET 
M918T mutation) to explore possible use of IO in this patient population. Exploratory cohorts 
(histologic subtypes) will be randomized.  
 
Anaplastic  Thyroid  Cancer  
Anaplastic thyroid cancer constitutes approximately 1 -2% of all thyroid cancer cases. It is  
usually a disease of the elderly with about three out of every four patients over the age of sixty 
and occurs more frequently in women than in men. It is on e of the most aggressive solid tumors 
and is characterized by [CONTACT_482529].  It accounts for 30 - 
50% of thyroid  cancer  mortality  and no effective  standard  of care exists  for these  patients  (6). An 
unpublished  study  using  the CTLA -[ADDRESS_619646] significant activity in 
differentiated as well as aggressive thyroid cancer (Russell Jenkins and David Barbie,  
manuscript submitted). In this assay, tumor cells from thyroid cancer biopsies or pleural  
effusions were grown to spher oids in a 3 -dimensional microfluidic fluid chamber system along 
with the tumor infiltrating immune cells from the same individual. Treatment of these spheroids 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482449],  unusually  rapid  cell death  compared 
with other tumor types tested in this system while untreated spheroids continued to grow. 
Cytokine release measured in the culture media was suggestive of a specific T -cell mediated  
anti-tumor response.  
 
These data and the lack of viable treatment options f or this patient population are the basis for 
this study. The primary goal is to study the activity of this combination in incurable RAI 
refractory thyroid cancer but will also include exploratory cohorts in medullary and anaplastic 
thyroid cancer. Explorat ory cohorts (histologic subtypes) will be randomized.

 Cancer immunotherapy is based on the premise that the body’s immune system can recognize a 
tumor as foreign and mount an effective antitumor response capable of eliminating that tumor. 
This likely requires immune recognition of specific tumor antigens, but  also effective  
functioning of activated T -cells capable of eliminating tumor cells as they arise and causing 
tumor shrinkage where existing tumor deposits are present. Conversely, tumor progression is 
likely intimately intertwined with mechanisms by [CONTACT_482530].  
 
One mechanism by [CONTACT_482531]. Thus, o ne strategy that exists for cancer immunotherapy is to 
modulate these regulatory immune checkpoints that largely exist on the surface of T -cells.  This 
can ideally overcome tumor mediated immune suppression, and potentiate nascent antitumor 
immune responses  that might otherwise have been unable to lead to meaningful tumor  
regression.  
 
Programmed death receptor -1 (PD -1, CD279), is a 55 kD type I transmembrane protein is a 
member of the CD28 family of T -cell costimulatory molecules that also includes CD28, CTL A- 
4, ICOS, and BTLA (7). PD -1 contains an intracellular membrane proximal immunoreceptor 
tyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM) and a membrane distal immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch 
motif (ITSM). Two ligands specific for PD -[ADDRESS_619648] been identified: PD -L1 (B 7-H1/CD274) and 
PD-L2 (B7 -DC/CD273) (8). PD -L1 and PD -L2 have been shown to down -regulate T -cell 
activation upon binding to PD -1 in both murine and human systems (8, 9). PD -1 delivers a 
negative signal by [CONTACT_66848] -2 to the phosphorylated tyro sine residue in the ITSM 
in its cytoplasmic region (10, 11). PD -1 is primarily expressed on activated T cells, B cells, and 
myeloid cells (11).  
 
Further evidence for a negative regulatory role of PD -1 comes from studies of PD -1-deficient 
mice. PD -1-deficie nt mice develop various autoimmune phenotypes, including dilated 
cardiomyopathy, a lupus -like syndrome with arthritis and nephritis, and accelerated diabetes 
mellitus (12 -14). The emergence of these autoimmune phenotypes is dependent upon the genetic 
backg round of the mouse strain and many of these phenotypes emerge at different times and 
show variable penetrance. In addition to the phenotypes of null mutations, PD -[ADDRESS_619649] disease, and 
type I diabetes (15, 16). Taken together, these results suggest that PD -[ADDRESS_619650] shown that blockade by [CONTACT_4002] -1 by [CONTACT_482532] (mAbs) can enhance the anti -tumor immune response and result in tumor rejection. 
Antitumor activity by [CONTACT_4002] -1 blockade functions in PD -L1-positive tumors as well as in tumors 
that are negative for the expression of PD -L1 (17 -22). This sugges ts that host mechanisms (ie, 
expression of PD -L1 in antigen -presenting cells) limit the antitumor response. Consequently, 
both PD-L1 positive  and negative  tumors  may be targeted  using  this approach.  In humans,

 constitutive PD -L1 expression is  normally limited to macrophage -lineage cells, although 
expression of PD -L1 can be induced on other hematologic cells as well, including activated T 
cells. However, aberrant expression of PD -L1 by [CONTACT_66846] a number of 
human malignan cies (23 -28). PD -L1 expressed by [CONTACT_482533] -specific T cells in vitro (11). Moreover, the expression of PD -L1 
may protect the tumor cells from the induction of apoptosis by [CONTACT_20411] T cells (29). 
Retrospective analyses of several human tumor types suggest that tumor over -expression (as 
measured by [CONTACT_4658]) of PD -L1 may permit immune evasion by [CONTACT_15198]. In renal cell carcinoma, 
high surface expression levels of PD -L1 on tumor cells are related to tumor aggre ssiveness (26, 
27). Subjects with high tumor and/or lymphocyte PD -L1 levels are 4.[ADDRESS_619652] a worse overall survival  
rate compared to low expression levels of PD -L1(30).  
 
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS -936558 or MDX1106) is a human monoclonal antibody 
(HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4] -S228P) that targets the programmed death -1 (P D-1) 
cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. Nivolumab is expressed 
in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is produced using standard mammalian cell  
cultivation and chromatographic purification technologies. The clinical st udy product is a sterile 
solution for parenteral administration.  
 
OPDIVO ™ (nivolumab) is approved for use in multiple countries including the [LOCATION_002] 
(US, Dec -2014), the European Union (EU, Jun -2015), and Japan (Jul -2014).  
 
Nivolumab has been shown t o bind specifically to the human PD -1 receptor and not to related 
members  of the CD28  family.  Nivolumab  inhibits  the interaction  of PD-1 with its ligands,  PD-L1 
and PD -L2, resulting in enhanced T -cell proliferation and interferon -gamma (IFN -γ) release in 
vitro (31). Nivolumab binds with high affinity to activated human T -cells expressing cell surface 
PD-1 and to cynomolgus monkey PD -1. In a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), nivolumab 
promoted a reproducible concentration -dependent enhancement of IFN -α release (32).  
 
In intravenous (IV) repeat -dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab was well 
tolerated  at doses  up to 50 mg/kg,  administered  weekly  for 5 weeks,  and at doses  up to 50 mg/kg, 
administered twice weekly for [ADDRESS_619653] highlighted the potential for enhanced toxicity 
when combined with other immunostimulatory agents.  
 
In addition,  an enhanced  pre- and postnatal  development  (ePPND)  study  in pregnant  cynomolgus 
monkeys with nivolumab was conducted. Administration of nivolumab at up to 50 mg/kg 2QW 
was well tolerated by [CONTACT_162621]; however, nivolumab was determined to be a selective 
developmental  toxicant  when  administered  from  the period  of organogenesis  to parturition  at 
<=10 mg/kg (area under the concentration -time curve [AUC] from time zero to 168 hours [AUC 
(0-168 h)] 117,000  
g
  h/mL).  Specifically,  increased  developmental  mortality  (including  late 
gestational fetal losses and extreme prematurity with associated neonatal mortality) was noted in 
the absence of overt maternal toxicity. There were no nivolumab -related changes in surviving 
infants  tested  throughout  the 6-month  postnatal  period.  Although  the cause  of these  pregnancy

9  
 failures was undetermined, nivolumab -related effects on pregnancy maintenance are consistent 
with the established role of PD -L1 in maintaining fetomaternal tolerance in mice (33).  
 
The PK, clinical activity, and s afety of nivolumab have been assessed in subjects with non -small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and clear -cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in addition to 
other tumor types. Please refer to the 2015 IB for specific details. Nivolumab is being 
investigat ed both as monotherapy  and in combination  with chemotherapy,  targeted  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  and 
other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Nivolumab is approved in multiple countries including the US for treatment of previously  
treated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced ren al cell carcinoma and previously 
treated, metastatic  squamous NSCLC, the EU  for treatment  of previously  treated, unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma, and Japan for treatment of unresectable melanoma.  
 
On November  10, 2016,  the U. S. Food  and Drug  Administration  approved  nivolumab  (OPDIVO 
Injection, Bristol -Myers Squibb Company), for the treatment of patients with recurrent or 
metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) with disease progression on 
or after a platinum -based therap y. 
 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was studied in subjects over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg administered as a single dose or as multiple doses of nivolumab every 2 or 3 weeks. The 
geometric mean (% CV%) clearance (CL) was 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), geom etric mean volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vss) was 8.0 L (30.4%), and geometric mean elimination half -life 
(t1/2) was 26.7 days (101%). Steady -state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 12 
weeks when administered at 3 mg/kg Q2W, and systemi c accumulation was approximately 3 - 
fold. The exposure to nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg administered every [ADDRESS_619655] 
on the CL of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), gender, race, baseline LDH, PD -L1. A PPK 
analysis suggested no difference in CL of nivolumab based on age, gender, race, tumor type, 
baseline tumo r size, and hepatic impairment.  
 
Although ECOG status, baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), albumin, body weight, and 
mild hepatic impairment had an effect on nivolumab CL, the effect was not clinically  
meaningful. When nivolumab is administered in c ombination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the CL of 
nivolumab was increased by 24%, whereas there was no effect on the clearance of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. 
Additionally, PPK and exposure response analyses have been performed to support use of 240 
mg Q2W dosing in addition to the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen. Using the PPK model, exposure of 
nivolumab at 240 mg flat dose was identical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for subjects weighing 80 kg, 
which was the approximate median body weight in nivolumab clinical trials (please see 2015 IB 
for more details ). 
 
Clinical  safety  
The overall safety experience with nivolumab, as a monotherapy or in combination with other 
therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 8,[ADDRESS_619656] advanced combination under development is 
nivolumab+ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], as is proposed in this study. Results to date suggest that the safety  
profile of nivo lumab+ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103976], described in more detail below, is 
consistent  with the mechanisms of  action of  nivolumab  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The  nature  of the AEs is 
similar to that observed with either agent used as monotherapy; however, both frequency and 
severity of most AEs are increased with the combination.  
 
Safety data for nivolumab administered in the context of NSCLC and melanoma are detailed 
below; additional information for other diseases can be found in the IB.  
 
Safety data for subjects with p reviously treated advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with 
nivolumab monotherapy in CA209017 (131 subjects), CA209057 (287 subjects), and CA209063 
(117 subjects) were pooled and safety analyses were performed for these pooled subjects who 
receiving nivolu mab monotherapy (a total of 535 subjects).  
 
Based on the pooled analyses, nivolumab monotherapy at a dose of 3 mg/kg administered IV 
Q2W has an acceptable safety profile, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_5206], severity, and types of 
AEs, drug -related deaths, SA Es, and AEs leading to discontinuation. The following were the key 
safety findings for these pooled subjects:  
 
The most frequently reported drug -related AEs (reported in ≥ 10% of subjects) were fatigue 
(19.6%), decreased appetite (12.3%), nausea (12.0%), a nd asthenia (10.5%). The majority of 
drug-related  AEs were  of Grade  1-2 in severity.  Drug -related  Grade  3-4 AEs were  observed  in 
11.0 % of subjects  and included  fatigue  (1.7%), pneumonitis  (1.3%),  and diarrhea (0.9%).  
 
Drug -related SAEs and drug -related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 7.9% and 
6.0% of subjects, respectively. The most frequently reported event (>=1% of subjects) was 
pneumonitis (1.9%). The majority of subjects experiencing drug -related SAE s and drug -related 
AEs leading to discontinuation had an event with worst grade of Grade [ADDRESS_619657] AE categories were skin (15.1%), GI (8.4%), 
and endocrine disorders (7.3%).  
 
The majority of select AEs in each category (described in more detail in the IB) were considered 
by [CONTACT_151705], except for AEs belonging to the hepatic, and 
renal select AE categories.  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619658] deaths (293/339) were due to disease progression. Two deaths (0.4%) were attributed to 
study drug toxicity: drug -related hypoxic pneumonia reported within [ADDRESS_619659] nivolumab 
dose (ie, on-study)  and drug-related  ischemic  stroke  withi n [ADDRESS_619660] nivolumab  dose.  One 
additional death, although reported prior to database lock for CA209057 CSR, had its causality 
changed after database lock to drug -related paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.  
 
Hematology laboratory results, liver func tion, renal function, and thyroid function remained 
stable in the majority of subjects. Abnormalities were primarily Grade 1 -2 in severity. The 
immunogenicity of nivolumab was low and not clinically meaningful.  
 
Safety data for subjects with previously tre ated and untreated unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma treated with nivolumab monotherapy in CA209037 (268 subjects), CA209066 (206 
subjects), and CA209067 (313 subjects) were pooled and safety analyses were performed for 
these pooled subjects receiving ni volumab monotherapy (a total of 787 subjects).  
 
Based on the pooled analyses, nivolumab monotherapy at a dose of 3 mg/kg administered IV 
Q2W has an acceptable safety profile, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_5206], severity, and types of 
AEs, drug -related deaths , SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation. The following were the key 
safety findings for these pooled subjects:  
 
The most frequently reported drug -related AEs (>=10% of subjects) were fatigue (29.2%), 
pruritus (18.4%), diarrhea (17.2%), rash (16.9%), and  nausea (13.7%). No drug -related Grade 3 - 
4 AEs with the exception of lipase increased (2.0%), diarrhea (1.3%), and ALT increased (1.1%) 
were reported in ≥ 1% of subjects.  
 
No drug -related SAEs of any grade were reported in ≥ 1% of subjects. The most frequ ently 
reported drug -related SAEs of any grade were hyperglycemia (0.6%), colitis, diarrhea, and 
pneumonitis (0.5% each).  
 
No drug -related AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported in ≥ 1% of subjects. 
The most frequently reported drug -related AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were 
ALT increased (0.9%), diarrhea (0.8%), AST increased (0.5%), and colitis (0.5%).  
 
The most frequently reported drug -related select AE categories with nivolumab monotherapy 
were skin (38.4%), GI (17.7%),  endocrine (10.8%), and hepatic (6.9%). The majority of select 
AEs were considered by [CONTACT_482534].  
Drug -related  select  AEs were  mostly  Grade  1-2. 
 
Across categories, the majority of high -grade events subsequently resolved, including those for 
which immunosuppressive medication was not initiated.  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619661]. 
12  
 The majority of deaths (229/251) were due to disease progression. Only 1 death was attributed to 
study drug toxicity; this death was due to drug -related neutropenia reported between [ADDRESS_619662] hematolog y assessments and liver/kidney function tests were primarily 
Grade [ADDRESS_619663] recently SCCHN. Approval for SCCHN was 
based on data from  an international, multi -center, open -label, randomized trial (CheckMate 141) 
comparing nivolumab with investigator’s choice (IC) of chemoth erapy (either cetuximab, 
methotrexate, or docetaxel) in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN with disease 
progression on or within 6 months of receiving platinum -based chemotherapy . Please see the IB 
version 15 for more details.  
 
In subjects with pr eviously treated, unresectable or metastatic NSQ NSCLC (CA209057), 
nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated superior OS compared with docetaxel, with a clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant improvement observed (HR=0.73 [95.92% CI: 0.59, 
0.89]; str atified log -rank test p -value = 0.0015). In subjects with previously treated, unresectable

compared with docetaxel, with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant  improvement 
observed (HR=0.59 [96.85% CI: 0.43, 0.81]); stratified log -rank test p -value = 0.0002).  
 
Results of secondary endpoints of ORR, DOR, and TTR further support the antitumor activity of 
nivolumab in both SQ and NSQ NSCLC subjects. In CA209057, PF S was not statistically 
different between treatment groups; however, while the median PFS favored docetaxel, the 
overall HR and 1 -year PFS rate favored nivolumab, indicating the potential for long -term PFS 
benefit from nivolumab in a subset of subjects. In  CA209017, nivolumab treatment resulted in a 
clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS with a 38% reduction in 
the risk of progression as compared with docetaxel.  
 
Nivolumab demonstrated superior OS compared with dacarbazine in  previously untreated 
subjects  with BRAF  wild-type advanced  (unresectable  or metastatic)  melanoma,  with a clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant improvement observed (HR=0.42 [99.79% CI:  
0.25,0.73]; p<0.0001). Results of secondary and explorat ory endpoints of PFS, ORR, DOR, and 
TTR further support the robust and durable antitumor activity of nivolumab in this population.

 nivolumab were administered once every 12 weeks for 8 doses. The th ree initial dose -escalation 
cohorts consisted of Cohort 1 (nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n = 14), Cohort 2 
(nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n = 17) and Cohort 3 (nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n = 6). Later, the study was amended to include Cohort 2a which evaluated 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg (n = 16). The following DLTs were observed in 
Cohort [ADDRESS_619670]/ALT ([ADDRESS_619671]); in Cohort 2 - Grade 3 uveitis ([ADDRESS_619672]) and 
Grade  [ADDRESS_619673]/ALT  ([ADDRESS_619674])  and in Cohort  3 - Grade  4 elevated  lipase  (2 subjects)  and 
Grade 3 elevated lipase ([ADDRESS_619675]). Based on these data, Cohort 2 was identified as the  
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and Cohort 3 exceeded the MTD.  
 
Among the 53 patients in the concu rrent -regimen group, adverse events of any grade, regardless 
of whether they were attributed to the therapy, were observed in 98% of patients. Treatment - 
related adverse events were observed in 93% of patients, with the most common events being 
rash (in 55 % of patients), pruritus (in 47%), fatigue (in 38%), and diarrhea (in 34%). Grade 3 or  
4 adverse events, regardless of attribution, were observed in 72% of patients, and grade 3 or 4 
treatment -related events were noted in 53%, with the most common events b eing elevated levels 
of lipase (in 13% of patients), aspartate aminotransferase (in 13%), and alanine aminotransferase 
(in 11%). A total of 6 of 28 patients (21%) had grade 3 or 4 treatment related events that were 
dose-limiting. Serious adverse events rel ated to the treatment were reported in 49% of patients in 
the concurrent regimen group. Common grade 3 or 4 selected adverse events that were related to 
the therapy included hepatic events (in 15% of patients), gastrointestinal events (in 9%), and 
renal ev ents (in 6%). Isolated cases of pneumonitis and uveitis were observed, a finding that is 
consistent  with previous  experience  with monotherapy.  A total of 11 patients  (21%)  discontinued 
therapy owing to treatment -related adverse events, no drug -related deaths were reported (35).  
 
More recently, the results of a phase 3 trial comparing the combination of nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482469] e reported (36). Nivolumab was 
given  at a dose of 1 mg / kg and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482470] a dose of 3mg/kg  every  three  weeks  for 
a total a four cycles. After this, nivolumab was continued alone every two weeks. There were  
314 patients enrolled on the treatme nt arm combining nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Adverse 
events of any grade occurred in 95.5% of those in this group. The most common adverse events 
group were diarrhea (in 44.1% of patients), fatigue (in 35.1%), and pruritus (in 33.2%). The 
incidence of treatm ent-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 was also higher in the nivolumab 
plus-ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315] (55.0%) than in the nivolumab group (16.3%) or the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315] 
(27.3%). Treatment -related adverse events of any grade that led to discontinuation of the study 
drug occurred in 7.7% of the patients in the nivolumab group, 36.4% of those in the nivolumab - 
plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315], and 14.8% of those in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315], with the most common 
events being diarrhea (in 1.9%, 8.3%, and 4.5%, respectively) and c olitis (in 0.6%, 8.3%, and 
7.7%, respectively). One death due to toxic effects of the study drug was reported in the 
nivolumab group (neutropenia) and one in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315] (cardiac arrest), but none were 
reported in the nivolumab -plus-ipi[INVESTIGATOR_448172]. 
 
Preliminary experience in lung cancer as part of the Checkmate -012 study has evaluated the 
combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482471] -small cell lung cancer.

 explored.  In arm A, both agents  were  administered  at a dose of 1 mg/kg  every  3 weeks  (Q3W,  N 
= 31). In arm B, nivolumab was administered at 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W; N = 40). Arm C and D dosed nivolumab at 3 mg/kg Q2W and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg every 12 weeks (Q12W; N=38) or Q6W (N = 39). Treatment -emergen t 
grade 3/4 adverse AEs occurred in 28% to 35% of patients in each group but led to 
discontinuation in just 3% to 10% of cases. All grade treatment -related AEs occurred in 77%, 
73%, 74%, and 69% of patients in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. The safet y profile was 
consistent with previous studies of the combination, and the discontinuation rate associated with 
AEs was similar to rates observed with nivolumab alone. The only grade 3/4 adverse events that 
occurred in as many as 10% of patients were hepat ic in arm B (10%) and skin -related in arm C 
and D (13%). Grade 3/4 pulmonary AEs occurred in no more than 3% of patients in any of the 
groups. There were no treatment -related deaths in the trial.  
 
This data suggests that delivering fewer doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b at a lower dose of 1mg/kg will 
reduce the toxicity of this agent combined with nivolumab.  
 
Clinical  efficacy  of nivolumab  combined  with  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482473], 
where combination therapy is now FDA approved.  
 
In the Phase 1 study CA209004, ascending doses of nivolumab were studied concomitantly with 
ascending doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482474]. In each 
arm of this multi -arm study, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460527] 3 weeks for 4 doses with 
nivolumab administered once every 3 weeks for 8 doses. Starting at week 24, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482475] 12 weeks for 8 doses. The three initial dose -escalation 
cohorts consisted of Cohort 1 (nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n=14), Cohort 2 
(nivolumab 1.0 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n = 17) and Cohort 3 (nivolu mab 3.0 mg/kg 
plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n = 6). Later, the study was amended to include Cohort 2a that 
evaluated nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg (n = 16). In the concurrent -regimen 
cohorts, across all dose levels, confirmed objective responses acc ording to modified WHO 
criteria were observed in 21 of 52 patients (40%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27 to 55) who 
had a response that could be evaluated. In addition, 4 patients had an objective response 
according to immune -related response criteria and  2 had an unconfirmed partial response. These 
patients were not included in the calculation of objective response rates.  
 
After noting that several patients had major responses (approaching complete response), a post 
hoc analysis  of the number  of patients  with tumor  reduction  of 80% or more  was conducted.  This 
depth  of response  was uncommon  in published  studies  of checkpoint  blockade  (37).  A total of 16 
patients had tumor reduction of 80% or more at 12 weeks, including 5 with a complete response. 
In the concurrent -regimen group, overall evidence of clinical activity (conventional, 
unconfirmed, or immune -related response or stable disease for >24 weeks)  was observed in 65% 
of patients (95% CI, 51 to 78). Responses were ongoing in 19 of 21 patients who had a response, 
with the duration ranging from 6.1 to 72.1 weeks at the time of data analysis (35).  
 
More recently, the results of a phase 3 trial comparin g the combination of nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482476]  (36).  Nivolumab  was

 given  at a dose of 1 mg / kg and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482470] a dose of 3mg/kg  every  three  weeks  for 
a total a four cycles. After this, nivolumab was continued alone every two weeks. The median 
progression -free survival was 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3 to 9.5) in the 
nivolumab group, 11.5 months (95% CI, 8.9 to 16.7) in the nivolumab -plus-ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315], 
and 2.9 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 3.4) in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315]. Significantly longer progression - 
free survival was observed in the nivolumab plus -ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482477] (hazard ratio for death or disease progress ion, 0.42; 99.5% CI, 0.31 to 0.57; P<0.001) and 
in the nivolumab group than in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315] (hazard ratio, 0.57; 99.5% CI, 0.43 to 0.76; 
P<0.001).  
 
The tumor -burden change was assessed as the change from baseline in the sum of the longest 
diameters  of the target  tumor  lesions.  The median  change  was −34.5%  (interquartile  range,  −75.4 
to 15.4) in the nivolumab group, −51.9% (interquartile range, −75.8 to −10.2) in the nivolumab 
plus-ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315], and 5.9% (interquartile range, −28.0 to 33.3) in th e ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315].  
 
Preliminary experience in lung cancer as part of the Checkmate -012 study has evaluated the

were 25% and 13%, in arm B and arm A, respectively.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_619678] common endocrine malignancy worldwide and accounts for over 30 
000 cases per year in the US. Multimodality treatment including surgery and radioactive iodine 
(RAI) results in a cure in >90% of differentiated thyroid cancer cases (DTC), which include 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], follicular and poorly differentiated histologies with their respective sub -types. 
However, in approximately 10% of cases distant metastasis occurs and the disease becomes 
iodine refractory (RAI refractory), rendering it incu rable. Sorafenib and lenvatinib are FDA 
approved for RAI refractory differentiated thyroid cancer based on randomized phase 3 studies 
which showed superior progression free survival compared to placebo but no difference in  
overall survival (OS) except for patients older than 65y (2, 4).  We have tested mTOR inhibition 
with everolimus  in a phase  2 study  and found  that the drug is very active  in this disease  as well 
(38). Everolimus will likely receive compendia listing this year based on our data. Medullary 
thyroid cancer which is derived from parafollicular c -cells, does not respond to RAI and has a 5 
year survival  of approximately  80%.  The vast majority  of these  cases  are driven  by [CONTACT_17906]  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619679] 
aggressive known malignancies known with a median survival of only approxima tely 6 months 
and 5 year survival less than 10%. For anaplastic thyroid cancer, no standard of care exists, 
although lenvatinib and mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus have shown promise (39).  
 
Data are emerging about checkpoint inhibition in thyroid cancer . PD -1 and PD -L1 expression  
has been documented and expression appears to be more pronounced in more advanced cases 
(Han and Walfish, ATA 2015). If the BRAF V600E mutation is present, which occurs in 
approximately 60% of newly diagnosed cases of DTC, PDL -1 expression and tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes appear to be higher than in BRAF -V600E no -mutated (WT) cases (40). 
Pembrolizumab, was tested in extensive phase 1 studies which included a number of RAI 
refractory thyroid cancer cases and PR’s occurred in 2/2 2 (9%) cases that were PD -L1 positive. 
These data were presented at the annual ASCO meeting 2016.  
 
The lack of predictive markers that could be used to select patients is a challenge in 
immunotherapy research. The correlation between PD -[ADDRESS_619680] found that spheroids grown from 3 patients with RAI refractory thyroid cancer (2 RAI 
refractory papi[INVESTIGATOR_482479], one Hurthle cell follicular TC) showed mild response to PD -1 inhibition 
but a dramatic and very rapid response to CTLA -4 inhibition. Cytokine measurements in the cell 
culture fluid showed a  rise in TNF -alpha, IL6, IFN gamma and IL2, all indicating response to 
checkpoint  inhibition  with CTLA -4 which  closely  resembles  what  would  be expected  in vivo 
(41).  Of note, all  patients had  recently or  currently been  treated with  mTOR inhibitors.  
 
We rec ently treated a patient with anaplastic thyroid cancer off label with nivolumab and saw a 
mixed response with some lesions growing while others were getting smaller.  
 
At this point, no standard options exist for patients with RAI refractory thyroid cancer or 
medullary thyroid cancer beyond first line treatment. Since none of the treatments available are 
curative and induce responses for limited time only, there is a major unmet need for treatment 
options.  
 
Rationale  for [ADDRESS_619681] a decade of experience using CTLA -4 and PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors, accumulating

around year two. Moreover, in Checkmate 003 a dose -escalation cohort expansion trial 
evaluating the safety and clinical activity of nivolumab in patients wi th advanced solid tumors 
implemented stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_102310] 96 weeks (~ 2 years). At 2 years, 16 NSCLC 
participants who were on still on therapy discontinued nivolumab per protocol, of these, 75% of 
patients (n = 12) were alive > 5 years and did  not receive further therapy after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482480].  
 
Moreover, long -term follow up data from study KeyNote -006 a phase 3 Melanoma study 
demonstrates that pembrolizumab provides durable efficacy after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_116081] -specified 
duration of treatment at 2 years. The median follow -up was of 33.9 months, among the 104 
(19%) participants who completed pembrolizumab, median exposure was 24.0 months. After 
additional median follow -up of 9.0 months after completion of pembroliz umab, 102 (98%) pts 
were alive and responses were durable in pts who completed pembrolizumab.  
 
In addition, data from different series are showing that patients receiving immunotherapy -based 
treatment may discontinue treatment due to safety events. In a re cent analysis in a melanoma

progression after 2 years of treatment is minima l, even in the absence of further treatment, which 
is consistent with existing data with PD -1/PD -L1 datasets. In addition, [ADDRESS_619685]  that there  is likely no  benefit from  treatment beyond  two years  in

immunologic changes that occur in response to either drug alone as well as both drugs in 
combination. The clinical endpoints are assessed during treatment with both drugs combined.  
 
Recently, a novel method for evaluating ex vivo response to immune  checkpoint blockade using 
patient -derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS) cultured in a 3 -dimensional microfluidic 
system has been developed. It could be demonstrated that spheroids isolated from fresh human 
tumor samples retain autologous lymphoid an d myeloid cell populations, including antigen - 
experienced  tumor  infiltrating  CD4/CD8  T lymphocytes,  and survive  in extracellular  matrix.  PD- 
1 and CTLA -4 blockade inhibition across a large panel of PDOTS including samples from 4 
thyroid cancer patients co nsistently showed up -regulated homeostatic lymphokines involved in 
T- and B - cell chemoattraction, demonstrating the feasibility of ex vivo profiling of PD -1 and 
CTLA -4 blockade, it could also be demonstrated that induction of a dysfunctional cytokine 
response may contribute to intrinsic resistance. (Jenkins et al., Nature , under review).  
 
We have tested samples from 4 patients with thyroid cancer and found that treatment of spheroid 
cultures with CTLA4, and to a lesser extent with PD -1 blockade led to the rapid cell death of 
thyroid cancer cells. These studies along with early reports to PD -1 and CTLA -4 blockade are  
the basis for this protocol.  
 
Patients will be required to undergo sequential biopsies, if accessible tumor is present. Tumor 
samples will be g rown in the microfluidic chamber system and tumor infiltrating lymphoid and 
myeloid cells will be analyzed both in vitro and by [CONTACT_482539], during treatment with nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482484] d rugs 
combined. This will allow us to determine optimal sequencing of the 2 drugs, and potential 
mechanisms of resistance during treatment.  
 
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may reflect the ongoing molecular evolution of thyroid cancer 
cells and reveal molecu lar and genetic changes that confer migration and invasion advantages. It 
is essential to define mechanisms of resistance at more than one timepoint. This is important 
because resistance mechanisms may be completely different at different stages of disease , but 
difficult to achieve with tissue biopsies. The goal of this exploratory endpoint is to understand 
how tumor heterogeneity evolves during progression of thyroid cancer, and with development of 
resistance/refractory disease. The objective is to determi ne the transcriptional profile of CTCs, 
myeloid and lymphoid WBC’s in peripheral blood and compare to cancer and tumor infiltrating 
lymphoid and myeloid cells in tissue biopsies through RNA sequencing, and to define how these 
change with therapeutic interv ention over time. Recent advances in next -generation sequencing 
and single cell isolation techniques will make this a minimally invasive approach to perform 
comprehensive genomics in patients with thyroid cancer to inform clinical treatment decisions.  
 
In addition to CTCs, other circulating biomarkers can be detected in plasma and serum, such as 
cell-freeDNA (cfDNA), microvesicles and exosomes. Some of these markers have been found to 
correlate with increasing tumor burden and treatment response in various types of malignancies. 
cfDNA,  and nucleic  acids  in microvesicles  and exosomes  in cancer  subjects  can harbor  many

 genetic alterations (mutations, microsatellite alterations, aberrant methylation), which are 
generally consistent with the tumor. Thus, blood may be a useful surrogate for tissue, and can be 
especially valuable at time points or in disease settings where t umor tissue collection may be 
challenging to evaluate drug response, resistance and disease progression.  
 
In addition, cell sorting of peripheral CD4 and CD8 positive cells by [CONTACT_482540] e changes immune cells undergo in 
response to checkpoint inhibition with PD -1 and CTLA -4. Samples will be assessed for 
expression of markers of exhaustion (PD -1, CTLA -4, TIM3) and how these markers change in 
response to nivolumab, Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482485].  
We have tested several peripheral blood samples from thyroid cancer patients and could 
document the presence of CTC’s as well as cfDNA in approximately 60% of cases.  
 
 
3. PARTICIPANT  SELECTION  
 
Participants must meet the following inclusion criteria on screening examination to be eligible to 
participate in the study:  
 
3.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
 
1. Metastatic, RAI -refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer (including papi[INVESTIGATOR_482486] a nd their sub -types such as Hurthle cell thyroid cancer  as well as 
poorly differentiated thyroid cancer), medullary thyroid cancer, or anaplastic thyroid 
cancer. RAI -refractoriness is not required for medullary or anaplastic thyroid cancer 
patients.  Patient s who are not candidates for RAI therapy, as determined by [CONTACT_1275], are also eligible.  
 
RAI-refractoriness  is defined  as absence  of uptake  of RAI on either  a low-dose diagnostic 
test or a post -treatment RAI scan in measurable lesions or radiograph ic progression of 
disease within [ADDRESS_619688] experienced intolerable side effects on a tyrosine kinase inhibitor  
(TKI), or be not suitable candidates for TKI. No progression is required for patients with 
anaplastic thyroid cancer.  
 
3. Age [ADDRESS_619689] one prior line of TKI treatment (excluding

7. Ability  to understand  and the willingness  to sign a written  informed  consent  document.  
 
8. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of 
contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks 
(30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half -lives) after the last 
dose of investigational drug  
 
9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test 
(minimum sensitivity 25 iu/l or equivalent units of hcg) at screening. Pregnancy test will 
be repeated on the day of the first dose of  study drug (before administration), although 
results of this test are not required for registration.  
 
“Women of childbearing potential” is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or  bilateral 
oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as [ADDRESS_619695] use any contracept ive method with a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually  
active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of [ADDRESS_619696].

not require contraception  
 
3.[ADDRESS_619697] a condition requiring systemic treatment with 
either  corticosteroids  (> 10 mg daily  prednisone  equivalents)  or other  immunosuppressive 
medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topi[INVESTIGATOR_119338] > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the 
absence of active autoimmune disease.

(6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have 
not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. 
For patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer or otherw ise particularly aggressive disease  
(as determined by [CONTACT_093]), the washout period for chemotherapy/radiotherapy 
and/or targeted agents will be at the investigator’s discretion.  
 
6. Patients  who are receiving  any other  investigational  agents.  
 
7. Patien ts with active brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because 
of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic 
dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.  
 
8. Uncont rolled  intercurrent  illness  including,  but not limited  to, ongoing  or active  infection, 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or 
psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requ irements.

4. REGISTRATION  AND  RANDOMIZATION  PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 General  Guidelines  for DF/HCC  Institutions  
 
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) 
OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of protocol therapy. Any participant not 
registered to the protocol before protocol therapy begins wil l be considered ineligible and 
registration will be denied.  
 
An investigator  will confirm  eligibility  criteria  and a member  of the study  team  will complete  the 
protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
 
For DTC and MTC patients, the eligibility checklist a nd all pages of the consent form will be 
faxed  to the ODQ  . The ODQ  Registrar  will (a) review  the eligibility  checklist,  
(b) register the  participant on the  protocol, and (c)  randomize the participant.  
 
For ATC patients, who will not undergo randomization, the study team is responsible for 
registering patients in OnCore.  
 
An email confirmation of the registration and/or randomization will be sent to the Overall PI, 
study coordinator(s) from the Lead Site,  treating investigator and registering person immediately 
following the registration and/or randomization.  
 
Following registration, participants may begin protocol therapy. Issues that would cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Princ ipal Investigator (PI). If a participant 
does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s registration on the 
study must be canceled. Registration cancellations must be made in OnCore as soon as possible.  
 
4.2 Registration  Process  for DF/HCC  Institutions  
 
DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject Protocol 
Registration (SOP #: REGIST -101) must be followed.  
 
4.3 Registration  Process  for Participating  Sites  
 
See Appendix  E 
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Treatment Regimen  
 
Treatment will be ad ministered on an outpatient basis. Expected toxicities and potential risk as 
well as management  of these  toxicities  are described  in Appendix  B and Investigator’s  Brochures 
and/or  Package  Inserts.  No investigational  or commercial  agents  or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_482487]  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619699]. 
25  
 described below may be administered with the intent to treat the participant’s malignancy during 
the course of treatment.  
 
The treatment  plan is shown  below:  
 
Nivolumab  infusion at a dose of 3mg/kg, once every 2 wee ks, until treatment discontinuation. 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482488] a dose of 1mg/kg,  once  every  6 weeks,  until treatment  discontinuation.  
 
For DTC  and MTC  patients,  there  will be randomization  to 2 arms  for a lead-in phase  in this 
study:  
Arm 1: Nivolumab  starts  2 weeks  prior  to Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482489] 2: Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482490]  2 weeks  prior  to Nivolumab  
 
The following  stratification  factor  will be used in order  to prevent  imbalance  across  treatment 
arms:  
• Histology  (differentiated  thyroid  cancer  vs. medullary  thyroid  cancer)

No difference  in efficacy  between  the 2 arms  is expected  and endpoint  analysis  will be 
performed based on both arms combined.  
 
Due to the aggressive nature of their disease, for patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer, both 
drugs will start synchronously on day 1. No randomization or lead -in phase will occur for these 
patients.  
 
Infusion schedule Arm 3: Same schedule will be followed beyond week [ADDRESS_619702] demographic parameters include age, sex, and race/ethnicity (recorded in accordance 
with prevailing regulations).  Baseline characteristics will  include ECOG PS (Appendix A), 
disease status, medical histories, and prior and concomitant medications.  
 
Additional testing required, as per Section 3, is:  hematology panel (see Table 1), chemistry  
panel  (see Table 1), coagulation  panel, urine  or serum  HCG  (in women of  childbearing potential; 
see Section 3 for when serum HCG testing is required), TSH (with reflexive Free T4 and Free 
T3), Mg, LDH, amylase, lipase.

Archival  tumor  sample  should  be collected  (block  or if not possible,  at least 20 unstained  slides). 
If unavailable, a baseline tumor biopsy is required, if safe to perform.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_619704]  study  visits  on the day scheduled  (+/- 3 days).  
 
Any changes from screening clinical evaluation findings that meet the definition of an AE will  
be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.  
 
If screening assessments occur within 3 days before start of study treatment, then they may serve 
as the baseline cycle 1 day 1 visit and screening tests do not need to be repeated.

immediate treatment. If a patient with anaplastic thyroid cancer chooses to participate, he/she 
will need to sign an additional section in the consent stating he/she agrees to weekly follow -up 
by [CONTACT_482542]/she experiences intolerable symptoms, as determined based on an 
assessment by [CONTACT_102]’s treating physician.  Anaplastic thyroid cancer patients deemed to 
have  intolerable  symptoms  will be followed  closely  outside  of the protocol’s  study  schedule  (i.e., 
with phone calls or clinic visits to be determined by [CONTACT_35425]) until they achieve 
tolerable symptoms as assessed by [CONTACT_102]’s treating physician.  
 
5.5 Agent  Administration  
 
When study drugs (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_120992]) are to be administered  on the same day, separate 
infusion bags and filters must be used for each infusion. It is recommended that nivolumab be 
administered first. The second infusion will always be ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and will start approximately 
30 minutes after completion of the nivo lumab infusion.  
 
BMS -936558 (nivolumab) is to be administered as a 30 (+/ - 15) minute  IV infusion. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162578] a 30 (+/ - 15) minute infusion following.

dosing differs by ≥ 5% from the weight used to calculate the dose, the dose must be recalculated. 
All doses should be rounded up or to the nearest milligram per institutional standard.  
 
5.6 Criteria  for Taking  a Participant  Off Protocol  Therapy  
 
Duration of  therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and 
tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease  progression  
 
• Intercurrent  illness that  prevents  further administration of treatment  
 
• Unacceptable  adverse  event(s)  
 
• Participant  demonstrates  an inability  or unwillingness  to comply  with the oral 
medication regimen and/or documentation requirements  
 
• Participant  decides  to withdraw  from the protocol  therapy  
 
• General  or specific  changes  in the participant's  condition  render  the participant  
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating investigator  
 
• A maximum  of [ADDRESS_619707]  study treatment  
 
Participants will be removed from the protocol therapy when any of these criteria apply (with the 
exception of disease progression, in which case participants may or may not be removed from 
protocol  therapy,  at the investigator’s  discretion).  The reason  for removal  from  protocol  therapy, 
and the date the participant was removed, must be documented in the case report form (CRF). 
Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant.  
 
When a participant is removed from protocol therapy, Treatment En ded information will be 
updated in OnCore by [CONTACT_5051].  
 
In the event  of unusual  or life-threatening  complications,  treating  investigators  must  immediately 
notify the Overall PI, Kartik Sehgal, MD  
 
5.6.1 Treatment  Beyond  Disease  Progression  
 
Accumulating  evidence indicates a minority of subjects treated with immunotherapy may derive 
clinical benefit despi[INVESTIGATOR_482491] (PD).  
 
Subjects  will be permitted  to continue  on study  treatment  for treatment  beyond  initial  RECIST  
1.1 defined  PD up to a total of 24 months  total treatment  duration  from  the start of study 
treatment as long as they meet the following criteria:  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619708]. 
29  
  
• Investigator -assessed  clinical  benefit  and no rapid  disease progression  
 
• Tolerance  of study  drug 
 
• Stable  performance  status  
 
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent 
serious complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)  
 
• Subject provides written informed consent prior to receiving additional study 
treatment,  using  an ICF describ ing any reasonably  foreseeable  risks  or discomforts,  or 
other alternative treatment options. The decision to continue treatment beyond initial 
investigator -assessed progression should be discussed with the investigator and 
documented in the study records.  
 
If the investigator feels that the subject continues to achieve clinical benefit by [CONTACT_166862],  the subject  should  remain  on the trial and continue  to receive  monitoring  according  to 
the Study Calendar (section 10).  
 
For the subjects who continu e study therapy beyond progression, further progression is defined  
as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden from time of initial PD. This includes an increase 
in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the diameters of new measurable lesion s 
compared to the time of initial PD. Study treatment should be discontinued permanently upon 
documentation of further progression.  
 
New  lesions  are considered  measurable  at the time of initial  progression  if the longest  diameter  is 
at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 15 
mm). Any new lesion considered non -measurable at the time of initial progression may become 
measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the long est diameter increases to at  
least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 15 
mm).  
 
In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to inclusion 
of new lesions which become me asurable, these new lesions must demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least [ADDRESS_619709] disease progression or treatment 
discontinuation (whichever comes last) and for survival for 2 years from study registration. 
Participants removed from protocol therapy for unacceptable adverse event(s ) will be followed 
until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event and if have not experienced first disease 
progression at time of discontinuation of protocol therapy, will continue to be followed until first 
disease progression. After disease prog ression, patients will be followed by [CONTACT_648], until death or 
for 2 years from study registration (whichever occurs first).  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619710].

5.8 Criteria  for Taking  a Participant  Off Study  
 
Participants  will be removed  from  study  when  any of the following  criteria  apply:  
• Patient  completed  required  follow -up 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal  of consent  for data  submission  
• Death  
 
The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF).  
 
The research  team  updates  the relevant  Off Study  information  in OnCore.  
 
 
6. DOSING  DELAYS/DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 Dose  Reduction  for Nivolumab  and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]:  
 
There  will be no  dose reductions  for nivolumab or  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482492].  
 
6.2 Dose  Delay  Criteria  for Nivolumab  and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]:  
 
Dose delay criteria apply for all drug -related AEs. Treatment delay is up to [ADDRESS_619711] dose are allowable (any dose delays 
greater than these will require approval from the PI).  
Tumor  assessments  for all subjects  should  continue  as per protocol  even  if dosing  is delayed. 
Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102326]:  
• Any Grade ≥ 2 non -skin, drug -related adverse event, except for fatigue and laboratory

range delay dosing for drug -related Grade ≥ 3 toxicity  
o Any Grade ≥ 3 drug -related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated 
with symptoms or clinical manifestatio ns of pancreatitis does not require dose 
delay. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_482493] ≥ [ADDRESS_619714]. 
31  
 • Subjects receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102327] -related 
toxicities that meet the criteria for dose delay, should have both drugs (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45767]) delayed until retreatment criteria are m et. (Exceptions apply to the retreatment 
criteria after dose delay of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45763] ≥ 3 amylase and lipase 
abnormalities  that are not associated  with symptoms  or clinical  manifestations  of pancreatitis 
and that are attributed to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482494].)  
 
Rescheduling:  
• Nivolumab may be delayed until the next planned ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102328] 12 days. This will permit periodic ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102329].  
• Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] s hould be dosed at the specified interval regardless of any delays in intervening 
nivolumab doses. However, in order to maintain periodic synchronized dosing of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102330], the dosing days of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482495]  +/- 3 day window.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482496] 3 day window  if needed 
to synchronize with the next nivolumab dose.  
• If an ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102333] 6 weeks from the prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102334], then 
subsequent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482497] 6 week interval between 
consecutive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102336].  
• A dose delay of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102337] > 12 weeks requires 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102338], with exceptions as noted in Section 6.4.  
 
6.3 Treatment  Discontinuation  Criteria  
For all subjects, global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time will be captured on the health 
outcomes questionnaires. Tumor assessments for subjects who discont inue study treatment 
without radiographic progression, should continue as per protocol until radiographic progression 
is determined.  
 
6.4 Nivolumab  Dose  Discontinuation  
Treatment  with nivolumab  should  be permanently  discontinued  for any of the following:  
• Any G rade 2 drug -related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to

• Dosing delays lasting > [ADDRESS_619722]  
with a dosing delay lasting > [ADDRESS_619723] be consulted. Tumor assess ments should 
continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to assess safety and 
laboratory studies should also continue every 6 weeks or more frequently if clinically 
indicated during such dosing delays.  
• Any adverse event, labor atory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued nivolumab 
dosing.  
 
The assessment for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separately from the 
assessment made for discontinuation of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Although there is overlap among the 
discontinuation criteria, if discontinuation criteria are met for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482498], treatment with nivolumab may continue if ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45774].  
 
If a subject meets criteria for discontinuation and investigator is unable to determine whether 
the event is related to both or one study drug, the subject should discontinue both nivolumab

Treatment  of Nivolumab  or Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482509], it is  
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such  
a reaction  were  to occur,  it might  manifest  with fever,  chills,  rigors,  headache,  rash,  pruritis, 
arthralgias, hypo - or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 infusion 
reactions should be reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded  
according  to NCI CTCAE  (version  4.0) guidelines.  Treatm ent recommendations  are provided 
below and may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate: 
For Grade  1 symptoms:  (Mild  reaction;  infusion  interruption  not indicated;  intervention  not 
indicated)  
 
Remain at bedside and monit or subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or 
equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab  administrations.  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non -steroidal anti - 
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, I V fluids]; prophylactic 
medications indicated for 24 hours).  
 
Stop the nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182], begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the 
subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetamino phen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion 
is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when  symptoms 
resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of 
the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur, then no further nivolumab 
or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_114569]. Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_619741]  be recorded  on the electronic  case report  form  (eCRF).  The following  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619742]. 
36  
 prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or 
equivalent)  and/or  paracetamol  325 to 1000  mg (acetaminophen)  should  be administered  at least 
30 minutes before additional nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45782]. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be 
used.  
 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_20309]/or brief interrup tion of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138]  
[eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated).  
 
Immediate ly discontinue infusion of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Begin an IV infusion of normal 
saline, and treat the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of  
a 1: 1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:  10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the 
investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolu mab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344712]. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. 
In the case of late -occurring hypersensitiv ity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritis within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg,  
oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
 
6.7.1 Management  Algorithms  for Immuno -Oncology  Agents  
Immuno -oncology (I -O) agents are associated with adverse events that can differ in severity and 
duration than adverse events caused by [CONTACT_20451]. Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482510] -oncology agents in this protocol. Management al gorithms have been 
developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of adverse 
events: Gastrointestinal, Renal, Pulmonary, Hepatic, Endocrinopathies, Skin, and Neurological.  
 
Early recognition and intervention are recommende d according to the management algorithms; 
and in addition include ophthalmologic evaluations for any visual symptoms in order to evaluate 
for nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_114571].  
 
The recommendations are to follow the algorithms in the nivolumab invest igator brochure for 
immune related events; while the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482511], 
the algorithms in the nivolumab brochure have been aligned to accommodate combinations as 
well as nivolumab monotherapy.  
 
Therefore,  the algorithms  recommended  for utilization  are in Appendix  B for reference.  
 
Additional details on the safety of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], including results from clinical 
studies, are available in the IB.  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619743]. 
37  
 6.8 Concomitant  Treatments  
 
6.8.1 Prohibited  and/or  Restricted  Treatments  
The following  medications  are prohibited  during  the study  (unless  utilized  to treat a drug related 
adverse event):  
• Immunosuppressive agents.  
• Immunosuppressive  doses  of systemic  corticosteroids  (except  as stated  in section  6.8.2)  
• Any concurrent anti -neoplastic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, 
immunotherapy,  extensive,  non-palliative  radiation  therapy,  or standard  or investigational 
agents for treatment of cancer)  
• Surgical  resection  of tumor  
 
Caution should be used regarding the use of herbal medications as there may be as yet unknown 
interactions  with nivolumab  and/or  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Discontinuation  of the use of herbal  medications 
prior to study enrollment is encouraged. Except for the permitted procedures specified as 
palliative local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Section 6.8.3), all other radiation therapy or surgery to any tumor 
lesion is not permitted during study treatment. Subjects who require such non -palliative 
procedures must be discontinued from study trea tment.  
 
6.8.2 Other  Restrictions  and Precautions  
Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily 
prednisone  equivalent)  or other  immunosuppressive  medications  within  [ADDRESS_619744] treatment 
are excluded. Inhal ed or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily 
prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.  
 
It is the local imaging facility  ’ s responsibility to determine, based on subject attributes (eg , 
allergy history, diabetic history and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and contrast 
regimen for each subject. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks should be considered in 
this assessment. Subjects with renal insufficiency should be  assessed as to whether or not they 
should receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. If CT is 
contraindicated for a subject because of an iodinated contrast allergy, then a contrast enhanced 
MRI of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed. Specific to MRI, subjects with 
severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) 
are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI contrast should not be given to this 
subject population. In addition, subjects are excluded from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic 
implants, pacemakers, etc. The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an individual subject in this 
study rests with the site radiologist, the investigator and the st andard set by [CONTACT_418590].  
 
6.8.3 Permitted  Therapy  
Subjects  are permitted  the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855],  ocular,  intra-articular,  intranasal,  and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily  prednisone  are permitted.  A brief  (less than 3 weeks)  course  of corticosteroids  for 
prophylaxis  (eg, contrast  dye allergy)  or for treatment  of non-autoimmune  conditions  (eg, 
delayed -type hypersensitivity  reaction  caused  by a contact  [CONTACT_20435])  is permitted.  Regular  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619745] meet criteria to continue treatment beyond progression in order to resume 
immunotherapy after palliative local therapy.  
 
Due to the aggressive nature of their disease, anaplastic thyroid cancer patients may receive 
palliative radiation to non -bone sites and/or resection at the investigator’s discretion. For these 
patients, the washout period for ra diation will be at the investigator’s discretion.  
 
The potential  for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_482512]/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482513]; however, anecdotal data suggests that it is tolerable. As concurrent radiotherapy and 
nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482514], in cases where palliative radiotherapy 
is required for a  tumor lesion, then nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482515] 1 week 
before,  during,  and 1 week  after radiation.  Subjects  should  be closely  monitored  for any potential 
toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy, and AEs should resolve to Grade <=1 prior to 
resuming nivolumab or nivol umab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
6.9 Holding  Study  Treatment  
 
Following disease control (i.e., stable disease or response) sustained over the course of a year or 
more of therapy (or as determined by [CONTACT_093]), the investigator may decide to hold study 
treatment f or an extended period of time.  In this case, imaging will be continued with timing at 
investigator’s discretion.  The investigator may choose to restart study treatment based on scan 
results.

 time points  will provide  fresh  tumor  samples  for analysis.  
 
Correlative blood samples will be drawn prior to treatment, at 2 weeks after start with either 
nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (end of week 2, prior to week 3) at week 9, and at 6 and 12 months 
after start of protocol treatment, and at the t ime of treatment discontinuation (or within 30 days 
after). Cell -free DNA will be analyzed using NexGen sequencing to detect the presence and 
changes in the amount of cell free DNA (cfDNA). Flow -based cell sorting will be used to 
determine if circulating t umor cells are present and how the proportion of CD4, CD8, and Treg 
cells changes over the course of treatment. These changes will be correlated with clinical 
response. We will also profile T cell neoantigens.  
 
Blood collection tubes as specified below wil l be obtained at the time points indicated in the 
study table.  There is a +/ - 3 day window (for obtaining these samples except for collection at  
W2 prior to start of second drug).  These collections will be taken at the time of routine blood 
collection time  points required for this study.  Specimens will be processed on site according to 
instructions below and shipped (via traceable carrier) to Dana -Farber Cancer Institute.  Once the 
shipment is received, samples will be subsequently processed, analyzed, and s tored at Dana - 
Farber Cancer Institute.  
 
All tubes should be transported at (ambient) room temperature. Collection kits containing the 
appropriate tubes will be sent to participating sites.  
 
Sequential biopsies are strongly recommended for patients with ac cessible tumor. These will 
consist of core needle biopsies and if necessary open biopsies.  
 
Samples will be subject to immune cell analysis by [CONTACT_482544]. Live 
cells will be used for in vitro analysis of immune response in the o rganotypic tumor spheroid 
culture system in either the lab of [CONTACT_482546] or the Bowden lab where response to 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482520]. The responses seen in vitro will be correlated 
with clinical response. Biopsies may be obtained prior to treatment start, after [ADDRESS_619760] scans at 8 weeks (within a 10 day 
window) and at time of progression.  
 
TIL’s will undergo RNA sequencing to determine changes of expression in response to 
nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482485]. This will allow to identify antigens involved in 
immune response as well as resistance mechanisms that could account for primary or secondary 
resistance  and tumor  progression.  
 
 
The tissue will be used to assess PD -1, PDL -1 expression, T -cell infiltration on IHC and flow 
cytometry.  
 
Whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing to assess changes in expression profile 
will be performed.  Single  cell sequencing  of infiltrating  immune  cells will be performed  as well.  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619761] additional archival tissue for such testing.  
 
Non-DF/HCC sites will be responsible for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_482521]/HCC 
on the day of collection. DF/HCC will provide shipment instructions to participating sites. This 
applies only to biomarker samples (routine  laboratory samples will be analyzed locally).

For the purposes  of this study,  participants  should  be re-evaluated for  response  every  8 weeks (or 
as clinically indicated).  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be 
obtained [ADDRESS_619770]. 
47  
  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (ver sion 1.1) 
[Eur J Ca 45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the 
RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_619771] their response classified according to the definitions stated below. 
(Note:  Participants who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 
will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Res ponse . Participants who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have 
received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for non -target disease.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_619772] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_619773] x -ray or ≥[ADDRESS_619774] be recorded  in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor  lesions  that are situated  in a previously  irradiated  area might  or might  not be 
considered measurable.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_619775] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease . All other lesions (or  sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangit is cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered 
non-measurable.  
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts  
should  not be consi dered  as malignant  lesions  (neither  measurable  nor non-measurable)  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619776]. 
48  
 since  they are, by [CONTACT_108],  simple  cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non - 
cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for sele ction as  
target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesi ons should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasio n, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions)  for all target lesions will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline  sum diameters.  If lymph  nodes  are to be included  in the sum,  then only the 
short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characteriz e any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods  for Evaluation  of Disease  
 
All measurements should  be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, 
or a digital  measurement  tool. All baseline  evaluations  should  be performed  as closely  as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning 
of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during fol low-up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they a re 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is r ecommended.  
 
Chest x -ray. Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]; however, CT is preferable.  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619777] slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice  
the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e .g. for body scans).  
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable glo bally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the same as was  used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type  of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans 
should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
FDG -PET.  While FDG -PET response assessments need addi tional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the  following algorithm:  
(a) Negative  FDG -PET at baseline,  with a positive  FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
(b) No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of di sease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
PD. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.  
(c) FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The u se of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches 
may lead to false positive CR due to limitat ions of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
PET-CT. At present, the low dose or  attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always  of optimal  diagnostic  CT quality  for use with RECIST  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619778] (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET p ortion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
 
MIBG (meta -iodobenzylguanidine).  The following is recommended, to assure high 
quality images are obtained.  
 
Patient  preparation:  Iodides,  usually  SSKI  (saturated  solution  of potassium  iodide), 
are administered to reduce thyroidal accumulation of free radioiodine, preferably 
beginning  the day prior  to injection  and continuing  for 3 additional  days (4 days 
total).  For infants  and children,  one drop t.i.d. is sufficient,  for adolescents  2 drops 
t.i.d.,  and for adults  3 drops  t.i.d. Participants  and/or  parents  are asked  about  exposure 
to potential interfering agents. If none is noted, an indwelling intrav enous line is 
established. The dose of MIBG is administered by [CONTACT_67481] 90 
seconds.  Images  from  the head  to the distal  lower  extremities  should  be obtained.  
 
I-123MIBG scintigraphy is performed to obtain both planar and tomographic images.  
Planar:  Anterior  and posterior  views  from  the top of the head  to the proximal  lower 
extremities  are obtained  for 10 minutes  at 24 hours  and occasionally  at 48 hours 
following  injection  of 10 mCi/1.7  square  meters  of body  surface  area (~150  μCi/kg, 
maximum  10 mCi).  Anterior  views  of the distal  lower  extremities  are adequate.  A 
large  field of view  dual head  gamma  camera  with low energy  collimators  is preferred.  
 
SPECT: Most participants receiving I -[ADDRESS_619779]/CT  may be performed  at institutions  with this capacity.  
 
Ultrasound.  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety  for independent  review  at a later data and, because  they are operator  dependent,  it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_13192],  confirmation  by [CONTACT_435999].  If there  is concern  about  radiation  expo sure 
from CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor  markers.  Tumor  markers  alone  cannot  be used to assess  response.  If markers  are 
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619780] normalize for a participant to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have be en 
published [JNCI 96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol 
26:1148 -1159,  2008].  In addition,  the Gynecologic  Cancer  Intergroup  has developed  CA- 
[ADDRESS_619781] -line trials in ovarian cancer [JNCI 92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology.  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, suc h as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease  is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference  the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the  
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to quali fy for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR) : Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619782]. 
52  
  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or  
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_482523], and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal 
Investigator).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation  of New  Lesions  
 
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. no t due to difference in 
scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or 
flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will 
indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirm ed, 
progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion 
was discovered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation  of Best Overall  Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Note : Participants with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

11.1.5  Duration  of Response  
 
Duration  of overall  response : The duration  of overall  response  is measured  from  the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first  
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive  disease  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the treatment  started,  or 
death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last 
disease evaluation).  
 
Duration of overall complete response : The duration of overall CR is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are first met for  CR until the first date that progressive disease 
is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events  
reported are censored at the last disease evaluation.  
 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start  of the treatment  
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619784].

11.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
 
Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or 
registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive.  
 
Progression -Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. 
Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease 
evaluation.  
 
Time to Progression : Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time fro m 
randomization (or registration) to progression, or censored at date of last disease 
evaluation for those without progression reported.  
 
 
11.1.7  Response Review  
 
For trials where the response rate is the primary endpoint, it is strongly recommended  
that all responses be reviewed by [CONTACT_13461](s) independent of the study at the study’s 
completion.  Simultaneous review of the participants’ files and radiological images  is the 
best approach.

12.3 Multi -Center Guidelines  
 
This protocol  will adhere  to the policies  and requirements  of the DF/HCC  Multi -Center  Data  and 
Safety  Monitoring  Plan.  The specific  responsibilities  of the Overall  PI, Coordinating  Center,  and 
Participating Institutions and the procedures for auditing are presented in Appendix E.  
 
•  The Overall PI/Coordinating Center is responsible for distributing all IND Action 
Letters  or Safety  Reports  to all participating  institutions  for submission  to their individual 
IRBs for action as required.  
 
•  Mechanisms  will be in place  to ensure  quality  assurance,  protocol  compliance, 
and adverse event reporting at each site.  
 
•  Except  in very unusual  circumstances,  each participating  institution  will order  the 
study agent(s) directly from supplier.  A participating site may order the agent(s) only 
after the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded to the Coordinating Center.  
 
 
13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Prior to Amendment 7, patients with DTC, MTC, and ATC were randomized to Arms 1 and 2. 
With approval of Amendment 7, patients with ATC were no longer randomized into Arms 1 and 
2, but rather registered into Arm 3 (for a total of n=7 patient s with ATC entered into Arms 1, 2, 
and 3). With approval of Amendment 12, the accrual for the ATC cohort was increased to n=10.  
 
The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate efficacy in terms of best overall response rate 
(CR+PR) for patients with DT C. The purpose of the randomization with nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482524]. Although patients will be randomized between arms, no differences in terms of 
efficacy are expected, therefore, for the primary endpoint of response, the arms will be analyzed 
together.  
 
A two -stage design (Simon’s minimax design) will be used to min imize the number of pts 
enrolled. Twenty -three eligible patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who start 
protocol  treatment  are to be accrued  in the first stage.  If there  are ≤ [ADDRESS_619788]. 
56  
 disease in response, accrual to this trial will be closed with the expectation that there is little 
evidence that the response rate will reach 25%. The probability that the trial will close early is 
59% if the true response rate is 10%. If there are >2 pat ients with DTC with disease in response, 
accrual will continue until a total of 32 eligible patients with DTC who start protocol treatment 
are entered. If there are >5 patients with DTC with disease in response among 32 eligible  
patients with DTC who began  protocol treatment, further testing of this regimen will be 
considered. If the true response rate is 25%, the probability of concluding the regimen is  
effective is 84%, if the true response rate is 10%, the probability of concluding the regimen is 
effecti ve is 9%. In addition, n=7 medullary and n=10 anaplastic thyroid patients will also be 
included as exploratory cohorts. Allowing for patients to be declared ineligible and/or not start 
protocol treatment after registration, a total of 54 pts will be entere d into Arms 1, 2, and 3. The 
following stratification factor will be used for Arms 1 and 2 only in order to prevent imbalance 
across treatment arms:  
• Histology  (differentiated  thyroid  cancer  vs. medullary  thyroid  cancer)  
(Prior to Amendment 7, patients with  anaplastic thyroid cancer were also randomized, and as of 
approval of Amendment 7, patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer will no longer be randomized, 
they will instead be entered into Arm 3 (see schema and section 5 for details)).  
 
The primary efficacy  population includes all eligible patients with DTC who begin protocol 
treatment. Best overall response will be summarized as a proportion with a corresponding exact 
95% confidence interval (CI) (if the trial closes to accrual after the first stage), or a  
corresponding 95% two -stage CI if the trial closes to accrual after the second stage. Best overall 
response for patients with medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer will also be summarized.  
 
For secondary  objectives:  Adverse  events  will be classified  and graded  according  to the CTCAE  
v.4.0. Frequencies of adverse events will be summarized among patients who begin protocol 
therapy overall and within histologic type. The distributions of progression and survival will be 
estimated within histologic subtype using a Kaplan -Meier method with  corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals for the median or time -specific event time. Several correlative studies are 
also planned.  Given  the small  sample  size of this trial, these  studies  are exploratory.  Samples  will 
be collected at baseline and at post -baseline timepoints as outlined in the protocol. Markers from 
the patients with evaluable samples will be summarized descriptively and graphically. Within 
subject changes in markers will also be analyzed. Assuming 32 patients with DTC with baseline 
and a pos t-baseline value provides 82% power to detect .54 SD mean difference (Wilcoxon sign 
rank test two -sided 0.05 alpha level). Markers from the patients with evaluable samples within 
medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer will also be summarized descriptively . 
 
With an estimated monthly accrual of [ADDRESS_619789] stage (n=23 eligible patients) in order to assess outcome; however, this suspension is also 
dependent on the actual observed accrual rate and the number of patients with confirmation of 
disease response status while the first stage of the trial is accruing  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619790] that meets the requirements of the International Committee of 
Medical  Journal  Editors.  A full report  of the outcomes  should  be made  public  no later than three  
(3) years after the end of the study.

contraception as listed below:  
 
Highly  Effective Methods of Contraception  
Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of < 1% when used consistently  
and correctly. WOCBP and female partners of male subjects, who are WOCBP, are expected to 
use one of the highly  effective  methods  of contraception  listed  below.  Male subjects  must  inform 
their female partners who are WOCBP of the contraceptive requirements of the protocol and are 
expected to adhere to using contraception with their partner. Contraception methods are as 
follows:  
1. Progestogen  only hormonal  contraceptio n associated  with inhibition  of ovulation.  
2. Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_122351] + progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such 
as Mirena®  
3. Nonhormonal  IUDs, such as ParaGard®  
4. Bilateral  tubal  occlusion  
5. Vasectomised  partner  with documented  azoospermia  90 days after procedure  
Vasectomised  partner  is a highly  effective  birth  control  method  provided  that partner  is the sole 
sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomised partner has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success.  
6. Intrauterine  hormone -releasing  system  (IUS).  
7. Complete  abstinence  
Complete  abstinence  is defined  as the complete  avoidance  of heterosexual  intercourse.  
Complete  abstinence  is an acceptable  form  of contraception  for all study  drugs  and must  be used 
throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus 5 half -lives of the investigational drug plus 
30 days).  
It is not necessary  to use any other  method  of contraception  when  complete  abstinence  is elected.  
Subjects  who choose  complete  abstinence  must continue  to have pregnancy  tests 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event 
that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  
 
Less  Effective Methods  of Contraception  
1. Diaphragm  with spermicide  
2. Cervical  cap with spermicide  
3. Vaginal  sponge  with spermicide  
4. Male  or female  condom  with or without  spermicide*  
5. Progestogen -only oral hormonal  contraception,  where  inhibition  of ovulation  is not the 
primary mode of action  
* A male and a female  condom must not be used together.  
 
Unacceptable  Methods  of Contraception  
1. Periodic  abstinence  (calendar,  symptothermal,  post-ovulation  methods)  
2. Withdrawal  (coitus  interruptus)  
A Phase  [ADDRESS_619806]. 
72  
 3. Spermicide  only 
4. Lactation  amenorrhea  method (LAM)

1.0 Objectives 
 To evaluate the efficacy of tr eatment with CMC- 544 with or without later 
rituximab in patients with re lapsed or refractory ALL.  
 To evaluate the side effe cts of the treatment.  
 2.0 Background  
2.1 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)  
Adult ALL encompasses a heterogeneous  group of lymphoid maligna ncies. Prognosis is 
related to age, karyotype, molecular profile, immunophenotype, and other disease 
features. Prognosis for pediatric ALL has improved significantl y over the last several 
decades to current long-term survival rates of greater than 80%  (1). However, long-term 
survival in adults is currently only 35% to 45% (2,3). The predominant reason for failure 
is disease recurrence. 
 The hyper-CVAD regimen (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vin cristine, 
doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alt ernating with high dose metho trexate and ara-C) 
(4,5), developed at M. D. Anderson, dem onstrated significant activit y, producing a 
complete remission (CR) rate of 90% and a cure rate of 40%-50%.   
 
  Protocol 2009-0872 
  December 2, 2011 
Page 4 of 36 Current outcomes of salvage ch emotherapy for A LL are poor, with complete response 
rates of 20% to 30% depending on prior therapy and duration of first remission. Median 
disease-free survival ranges from  2 to 7.5 months. Long-term su rvival after ALL salvage 
therapy is rare.  Less than 10% o f patients are eligible for allogeneic stem cell 
transplant.  Among them the cure r ate is 20% or less.  No standard of care has been 
defined, so that salvage therapy  options are generally limited to investigational agents 
once patients fail standard chemotherapy regimens (6,7). Not many treatments are 
available for ALL salvage.   
 New agents or regimens are needed  to improve outcome in ALL.  A LL blasts express 
several surface markers includi ng CD19, CD20, and CD22.  CD22 i s expressed on the 
surface of ALL blasts in more th an 90% of patients.  Several ne w monoclonal antibodies 
have been developed that target thes e surface markers.  Monoclo nal antibodies with 
proven efficacy against ALL coul d potentially, when used in com bination with 
chemotherapy, significantly improve ALL prognosis.  For example , rituximab has 
minimal single agent activit y in ALL but, when added to hyper-C VAD, has improved 
significantly the outcome in Burk itt’s ALL and in CD20-positive  pre-B ALL. 
 
2.2 The Treatment -- CMC-544 (Inotuzumab Ozogamycin) and Rituxi mab 
CMC-544 (inotuzumab ozogamicin) is  a CD22-targeted cytotoxic agent composed of a 
humanized IgG4 anti-CD22 antibody c ovalently linked to N-acetyl-g-calicheamicin 
dimethyl hydrazide (CalichDMH) via the acid-labile 4-(4V-acetyl phenoxy) butanoic acid 
linker (8-10) . CD22 is a B-lymphoid lineage–specific differentiation antigen expressed 
  Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_918698] produced by [CONTACT_679122].  It b inds in the minor groove 
of DNA and causes double strand DNA breaks in a relatively sequ ence-specific and 
thioldependent manner leading to apoptotic response in cells (11-13) . CMC-[ADDRESS_918699] CD 22+ B-cell lymphoma 
(BCL) cell lines in vitro and c auses regression of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ( minimal disease), small 
established (palpable disease) , and large BCL xenografts, with a high therapeutic index 
(9). In addition, CMC-[ADDRESS_918700] CD22 positive ALL cell lines 
(14). In the absence of the conjugat ed CalichDMH, G5/44, the target ing monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) in CMC-544 is ineffective in vivo as an antitumor agent in various 
preclinical models (8).  Thus, CMC-[ADDRESS_918701] a better 
therapeutic index than that of conventional chemotherapeutic ag ents. Based on its 
potent antitumor activity in pre clinical models, CMC-544 is cur rently being evaluated in 
patients with B-cell no n-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).  Early resul ts show encouraging 
activity with response rates of 40% to 75% in patients with ref ractory relapsed 
BNHL (15).  CD22 is expressed on leukemic  blasts in more than 90% of adul ts with ALL.  
Thus, CMC-544 may be also an e ffective treatment for ALL. 
  Protocol 2009-0872

Rituximab is a chimeric human Ig G1 antibody targeted to another B-lymphoid lineage–
specific molecule, CD20. It represents a major therapeutic adva nce in B-NHL therapy. 
Rituximab mediates its antitumor activity by [CONTACT_679123] s that include 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cel lular cytotoxicity 
(ADCC), and direct inducti on of apoptosis in BCL (16-17) . The activity of single agent 
rituximab is modest in BNHL, chr onic lymphocytic leukemia, and ALL.  However when 
combined with chemotherapy it has improved outcome significantl y in all 3 entities (18-
21).   
 
2.3 Rationale for the Study Design 
Due to its clinical safety, rit uximab is widely used in combina tion with various cytotoxic 
agents.  Treatments using combinat ions of rituximab with cytoreductive combination 
chemotherapy, like CHOP (a comb ination of cyclophosphamide, dox orubicin, vincristine, 
and prednisone), hyper-CVAD, or  fludarabine-cyclophosphomide ar e highly active.  
However, such combinations o f chemoimmunotherapy also suffer fr om various systemic 
toxicities associated with the non-targeted nature of chemother apy.  Thus, studies of 
targeted therapy combinations l ike CMC-544 (tar get CD22) and ri tuximab (targets 
CD20) in pre-B ALL w ould be highly attracti ve, because of the potential of high efficacy 
and low toxicity.  This is the purpose of this study.  If successful, this combined targeted 
therapy may become a new standard of care for patients with ref ractory relapsed ALL.  
It may also be brought into front line therapy of minimal residu al disease to increase the 
  Protocol 2009-0872 
  December 2, 2011 
Page 7 of 36 cure of patients with newly diagnosed pre-B ALL.  Thus the stud y has major potential 
therapeutic implications for im proving adult ALL prognosis.  
 
The phase I-II studies of CMC-544 determined the phase II dose to be 1.8 mg/m2 once 
every 3-4 weeks.  The DLT was myelosuppression.  Other side effects were 
gastrointestinal and hepatic.  Only 1 case of veno occlusive disease was noted among 176 patients treated (14).  Phase II studies combining rituximab 375 mg/m
2 on Day 1 
and CMC-544 1.8 mg/m2 on Day 2 were safe and effective in lymphomas (15). 
 2.[ADDRESS_918702] been treated.  Fifteen 
of them were in second salvage or w orse; eight of them have tra nslocation 4;[ADDRESS_918703] achieved either CR (n=5) or 
Cri (n=7), for an overall respons e rate of 57%.  This is even b etter than what is expected 
using standard combination int ensive chemotherapy in first salv age, with which the CR 
rate would be expected to be abou t 30%.  Toxicity has been mini mal.  There were two 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_679113].  Fever  on Day [ADDRESS_918704] 4 patients to undergo allogeneic stem 
cell transplant.  Based on the findi ngs we propose to 1) allow treatment of patients in 
first salvage regardless of the duration of first CR, and 2) in crease the total number of 
  Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_918705] been treated.  Of 32 ev aluable patients, 8 
achieved CR and 10 achieved CRi or CRp for an overall response rate of 18/32 =56%.  
Toxicities were reasonable and included Grade 1-2 elevations of  liver function tests 
which were transient.  Two pat ients had Grade 3 liver function abnormalities; the 
attribution to the drug was questionable. 
 
From preclinical studies, it is thought that lower dose more fr equent exposure schedules 
to inotuzumab may offer better anti-ALL efficacy.  Following di scussions in the 
Leukemia group and with [COMPANY_007] investigators, it was decided to  study a different 
schedule of inotuzumab given week ly times 3.  The total dose pe r course is the same, 
1.8 mg/m2.  The treatment will be  with inotuzum ab 0.8 mg/m2 on Day 1, 0.5 mg/m2 on 
Day 8, and 0.5 mg/m2 on Day 15.  C ourses are given every 3 week s.  When rituximab 
is required, it will be given week ly with inotuz umab.  A total of 20 patients will be treated 
to gain experience with efficacy and toxicity.  Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_679114] < 40%.  
2.[ADDRESS_918706] 15 evaluable patients, 2 achieved CR  (12%), 5 achieved CRp 
(31%) and 1 achieved CRi (6%).  Thus, 8 of 15 evaluable patient s (53%) achieved 
marrow CR.  Five of the 7 evaluabl e responders (71%) achieved M RD negativity.  Three 
patients underwent allogeneic SCT ; no VODs were noted.  Transie nt liver enzyme 
elevations grade 1-2 we re noted in 5 of 20 (25%), severe in 2.   
 
In discussions with [COMPANY_007], we emphasized the importance of the se findings but the 
limited number of patients makes definite conclusions difficult .  It was agreed to 
increase the number of treated pat ients on the weekly schedule by [CONTACT_20904] 20, for a 
total of 40 patients, to assess more precisely the response and  toxicity profile compared 
with the 49 patients treated with the single dose every 3-4 wee ks. 
 
3.0 Background Drug Information  
3.1 Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Nonclinical Data 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an anti body-targeted intravenous (IV) chemotherapy agent 
composed of an antibody, targeti ng CD22 antigen, which is linke d to calicheamicin, a 
potent cytotoxic antit umor antibiotic. The targeting agent in inotuzumab ozogamicin is a 
humanized IgG4 antibody, G544 tha t specifically recognizes huma n CD22. Being an 
IgG4 isotype antibody, G544 is no t expected to mediate effector  functions such as 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellula r cytotoxicity. CD22 is 
expressed on both normal and malig nant cells of the mature B-lymphocyte lineage. 
Nonmalignant, mature lymphocytes  express CD22; however, lymphoc yte precursor 
  Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_918707] of treatment with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin on long-term immune function is expected to be minimal. 
 
The concept of antibody-target ed chemotherapy has been successf ully translated into a 
clinically validated therapeutic  agent, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg). N-acetyl 
calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide (N-acetyl calicheamicin DMH), the cytotoxic entity in 
both inotuzumab ozogam icin and gemtuzumab ozogamicin, is a deri vative of 
calicheamicin methyl trisulfide.  N-acetyl calicheamicin DMH is at least 100- to 1000-fold more p otent than current 
cytotoxic therapeutics, such as doxorubicin. Its high potency m akes N-acetyl 
calicheamicin DMH an ideal can didate for antibody-targeted chem otherapy. 
 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is expect ed to have greater efficacy than unlabeled monoclonal 
antibodies and to have efficacy at least comparable to the leading chemotherapeutic or 
radio-immunoconjugate based ther api[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Because of its targeted nature, it is expected 
to have a reduced incidence of si de effects compared with conve ntional cytotoxic 
chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy . This may confer important a dvantages in 
tolerability and reduced need for supportive care for subjects treated with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin as a single agent and offers the potential to intens ify combination regimens 
without substantial add itional toxicity. 
 
  Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_918708] between inotuz umab ozogamicin and rituximab,  as the combination of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin plus rituxi mab was: (a) more efficacious against established 
subcutaneous Ramos B lymphoma xenografts in nude mice, and (b) increased long 
term survival of severe immunodef icient mice with disseminated Ramos B lymphoma

studies that are relevant to this study (23).  Also refer to the mo st recent version of the 
investigator’s brochure for a summary of the known and potentia l risks and benefits, if 
any, to human subjects. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_918709] in human trial (3129K1-1 00-WW [100-WW]) of inotuzumab  ozogamicin was an 
open-label, dose-escalating, si ngle-agent study in 79 subjects with CD22-positive B-cell 
NHL(23). 
 
The study defined the maximum-t olerated dose and showed a safet y profile (and 
preliminary efficacy data) that supported advancement of inotuz umab ozogamicin’s 
clinical development (8,9,22) . 
 This continued clinical  development included initiation of 4 ad ditional trials (2 global and 
2 in Japan) involving the use of i notuzumab ozogamicin as either a single agent or in 
combination with rituximab for treatment of CD22-positive B-cel l NHL. The combination 
strategy was evaluated since B- NHL cells consistently express both CD20 and CD22; 
thus, it is reasonable to combine rituximab and inotuzumab ozog amicin (anti-CD20 and 
CD22 targeting antibodies, respec tively) in an attempt to enhan ce the therapeutic 
advantage of either agent. Nonclini cal data supported this reas oning (see Inotuzumab 
Ozogamicin Nonclincal Data section).

The following safety and efficacy discussions focus on 2 of the 5 studies currently comprising the clinical develop ment of inotuzumab ozogamicin (s tudies 100-WW and 
3129K3-101-WW [101-WW]) since these are global trials that incl ude patients with 
DLBCL. Furthermore, because res ponse data are available by [CONTACT_679124], efficacy 
discussions for studies 100- WW and 101-WW will focus on patient s with diffuse large B-
cell lymphoma (DLBCL). 
 
3.2.1 Study 100-WW: Saf ety and Efficacy of S ingle-agent Inotuzu mab 
Ozogamicin.  Study 100-WW was a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of the 
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of inotuzumab o zogamicin administered 
as a single-agent to [ADDRESS_918710] dose of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 1.8 mg/m2 given every [ADDRESS_918711] subjects (60.8%) had 
received at least 4 prior treatm ent regimens. Subjects ranged i n age from 26 to 82 years 
(median, 60 years).  The most common treatment emer gent adverse events (TEAEs, incidence ≥ 20% of 
subjects) were hematologic (t hrombocytopenia [84.8%], neutropen ia [43.0%], anemia 
[22.8%], and leukopenia [21.5%]); gastrointestinal (nausea [51. 9%], anorexia [31.6%],

neutropenia (25.3%), leukopenia ( 13.9%), lymphopenia (11.4%), a nd anemia and 
hypokalemia (6.3% each). Others were: asthenia (10.1%) and gamm a glutamyl 
transpeptidase (GGT) increased (6.3%) increased blood fibrinogen, blood lactate 
dehydrogenase, and venooclusive d isease among adverse reactions  or as adverse 
reactions leading to the discont inuation of the drug. Dose-limi ting toxicities were all 
hematologic events: 3 cases of grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 1 even t of bleeding (injury-
related) that required a platele t transfusion because of concur rent thrombocytopenia, 
and 1 event of grade 4 neutropenia. Fifteen ( 15) subjects with DLBCL in the expanded 
MTD cohort were evaluable for tumor response (24) (received ≥ 2 doses of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin and had tumor assessm ents at both baseline and postbaseline visits). 
These subjects had a best overall  response rate (ORR) of 47.0% (2 CR and 5 PR), a 
median progression-free-survival (PFS) of 105 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 55 to 343), and a median overall surviv al (OS) of 273 days (95% CI, 1 68 to 518).

Page 19 of 36 Courses can be started earlier, e very 2 weeks if evidence of rapid progression after 
approval by [CONTACT_458]. 
 5.2.2 In a second phase (see 2.4), 20 pat ients will be treated with w eekly CMC-544.  
CMC-544 will be given at 0.8 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour (+ 15 minutes) on Day 1, 0.5 mg/m2 
IV over 1 hour (+ 15 minutes) on Day 8, and 0.5 mg/m2 IV over 1  hour (+ 15 minutes) 
on Day 15.  Weekly doses can be gi ven at + 1 day.  Course may b e repeated every 3 
weeks.  Recommended premedication bef ore CMC-544:  acetaminophen [ADDRESS_918719] ome may be administered at the  discretion of the 
treating physician.   
 5.2.3 If stable disease, no improvemen t or progression after 2 courses of CMC-544, 
patients may continue  on CMC-544 at the same  dose every 3-4 weeks, with the addition 
of rituximab 375 mg/m
[ADDRESS_918720] dose of rituximab 
will be given as a slow infusi on over 6-8 hours depending on reactions and side effects.  
It will be given on Da y 1 and CMC-544 on Day 2.  Subsequent cou rses of CMC-544 and 
rituximab may be given on the sa me day; CMC-[ADDRESS_918721] 
dose; with subsequent weekly doses, both will be given weekly, rituximab preceding 
CMC-544.  The weekly dose of r ituximab will be 375 mg/m2. 
 
Infusion 1 of rituximab will be over 6-8 hours following infusi on rate increases as per 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137288].  Infusions 2-6  of rituximab may be run at f aster rates of 2-6 hours as 
indicated by [CONTACT_679127][INVESTIGATOR_137288]. 
 
5.2.4 Patients achieving response, def ined as CR or CRi , or partial r emission (PR) 
may continue therapy for up to 8  cycles (about 8-12 months of therapy).  Patients with 
progression at any time or withou t objective response after 3 c ycles will be taken off 
study.  
5.3 Treatment Duration and Dose Adjustments 
Patients will receive 2 courses of CMC-544.  If CR, complete re mission without platelet 
recovery  (CRi), or PR is documented, which ever comes first, then continu e CMC-544. If 
a patient does not achieve a C R, CRi, or PR then add rituximab as under 5.2.  
 
Patients who achieve a CR, CRi, or PR may receive up to a total  of 8 cycles of therapy 
depending on leukemia response and resolution of toxicities. Su bjects who demonstrate 
a CR or CRi after 1 or 2 cycles  of therapy will receive a maxim um of 4 cycles of therapy. 
Subjects who are in a CR or CRi after 3-4 cy cles may receive a maximum of 2 
  Protocol 2009-0872 
  December 2, 2011 
Page 21 of 36 additional cycles of therapy after achieving a CR or CRi. After  a total of 4 cycles, 
patients will be assessed for t he need of the 4 additional cycles based on response and 
liver toxicities with the previous 4 cycles. Cycles are repeate d about every 4 weeks 
(range 3-6 weeks) depending on l eukemia response, resolution of  toxicities, and 
recovery of hematopoiesis.  
 Patients receiving subsequent cycles (cycles 2-8) will be treat ed at the same dose level 
if grade < [ADDRESS_918722] experienced a 
favorable response of their leukemia (decrease in peripheral bl ood or marrow blasts).  
Re-treatment will only occur upon  recovery to < grade [ADDRESS_918723] non-hematol ogic toxicity of > grade 3 and a favorable response to 
therapy, additional cycles of therapy at 25% dose reduction of CMC-[ADDRESS_918724] a  positive response to 
therapy in which case they will continue on study after discuss ion with the Principal 
Investigator.  
 
5.4 Concomitant Medications  
Necessary supportive measures for  optimal medical care will be given throughout the 
study as determined by [CONTACT_679128]’s medical need. No 
  Protocol 2009-0872 
  December 2, 2011 
Page 22 of 36 concomitant chemother apy (with the exceptio n of prophylactic or therapeutic intrathecal 
chemotherapy for active CNS diseas e or CNS disease in remission ), immunotherapy, or 
therapy with monoclonal antibodies will be allowed during the s tudy. Investigational 
agents that are not used for the treatment of the leukemia per se (e.g. anti-infective 
prophylaxis or therapy) will be allowed.  
 Use of any hematopoietic growth  factor (e.g. G-CSF, GM-CSF, or erythropoietin) is at 
the discretion of the treating physician and is permitted if ju dged in the patient’s best 
medical interest.   Prophylactic antibiotics, antif ungals, and antiviral agents (e.g. levofloxacin, itraconazole, 
valacyclovir, etc.) are recomm ended; however, the use of these or other drugs will be 
left to the treating physi cian’s discretion.  
 The use of hydroxyurea or steroi ds is permitted for temporary c ontrol of WBC elevations 
in patients with aggressive dis ease both prior and during treat ment.  Hydroxyurea may 
be given at 1-[ADDRESS_918725] medical/ surgical history as far as relevant. Within 14 days of study start

terminating the study may inclu de, but are not limited to:  
  Protocol 2009-[ADDRESS_918731] 
to patients.   9.8 If the patient enrollm ent is unsatisfactory.  
 
10.0 Reporting Requirements  
Adverse event reporting will be as  per the NCI criteria and the  MDACC Leukemia 
Specific Adverse Event Recor ding and Reporting Guidelines. 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Co mmon Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Ev ents (CTCAE) version 3.0 (Appendix A)  will be utilized for 
adverse event reporting. (http:/ /ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html).   
 
Refer to Appendix E  for Leukemia-Specific Adverse  Event Recording and Reporting 
Guidelines.  Only unexpected AEs  will be recorded in the Case R eport Form 
(CRF).  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_679117] a t the completion of each cours e.  Following signature, 
the Case Report Form will be used a s source documentation for t he adverse events for 
attribution.  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) 
A serious adverse event is – any adverse drug experience occurr ing at any dose that 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
  Protocol 2009-0872 
  December 2, 2011 
Page 28 of 36  Death 
 A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse exper ience that places the 
patient, in the view of the init ial reporter, at immediate risk  of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does  not include an adverse exper ience that, had it 
occurred in a more severe fo rm, might have caused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320864] 
 A persistent or significant dis ability/incapacity – a substant ial disruption of a person’s 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgmen t, they may jeopardize the pati ent or subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such m edical events include allergic br onchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergen cy room or at home, blood dysc rasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the develop ment of drug dependency or 
drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
 Important medical events as def ined above, may also be conside red serious 
adverse events. Any important m edical event can and should be r eported as an SAE 
if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_679129], Office of 
Research Education and Regu latory Management (ORERM). 
  Protocol 2009-0872 
  December 2, 2011 
Page 29 of 36  All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meet ing the definition of a 
SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timefram es and procedures 
outlined in “University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center I nstitutional Review 
Board Policy on Reporting Serious Adverse Events”.  Unless stat ed otherwise in the 
protocol, all SAEs, expected o r unexpected, must be reported to  ORERM, 
regardless of attribution (withi n 5 working days of knowledge o f the event).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_679118] (previously 
described) will not have an expedited report but it will be included in the annual 
report via the SAE log. 
 All life-threatening or fatal events, expected or unexpected, and regardless of 
attribution to the study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours  
(next working day) of knowledge of  t h e  e v e n t  t o  t h e  S a f e t y  P r o j ect Manager in 
ORERM.   
 The MDACC “Internal SAE Report Form for Prompt Reporting” will  be used for 
reporting to ORERM.  
 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the pati ent signs consent until 
[ADDRESS_918732] returned  to baseline, 
progression of the event has sta bilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of 
the event. 
 Additionally, any serious adver se events that occur after the [ADDRESS_918733] be reported to ORERM. T his may include the 
development of a secondary malignancy.

(Please see Appendix E  regarding data capturing of adverse events and adverse 
events source documentation.) 
 
Reporting to FDA: 
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_304492] (Safety Project 
Manager ORERM) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_679119] C ode of Federal Regulations, Good  Clinical Practices, the

11.0 Statistical Considerations  
A total of up to 60 patients will be treated. The primary endpo int for efficacy is 
response which is defi ned as CR, CRi or PR. 
 
The method of Thall [1995] will be employed to perform interim futility monitoring.  
The trial will be stopped early if: Pr[  > 0.20 | data] < 0.10 . Where  denotes the 
response rate. That is, given t he outcomes from the patients wh o have already 
been evaluated, if we determine t hat there is less than a 10% c hance that the 
response rate is 20% or more, we  will stop the tr ial for futility. We assume a prior 
distribution of  ~beta(1,1).  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_679120]: 
  Protocol 2009-0872

(57%) had achieved CR or Cri.  Thi s was achieved with minimal d rug related side 
effects, and allowed several patients to proceed safely to allo geneic stem cell 
transplant.  These data are very  encouraging and if consistent in a larger number of 
patients may show that single agent CMC-[ADDRESS_918735] an overall response rate < 40%.  Therefore the study 
will stop early if the number of responses over number evaluable is: 0/7, 1/10, 2/14, and 
3/17.  Otherwise a total of [ADDRESS_918736] 15 evaluable patients, 8 (53%) a chieved marrow CR.  An 
additional 20 patients will be treated for a total of 40 patien ts to assess more precisely 
the response and toxicity rates  with the weekly schedule.

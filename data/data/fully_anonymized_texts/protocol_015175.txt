Study Overview  This is a prospective, randomized, double- blinded, placebo -controlled, 
multinational, multicenter, parallel -group, phase III study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of Apatinib plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) 
compared to Placebo  plus BSC in patients with advanced or metastatic 
gastric cancer who failed two or more prior trea tment regimens .  
After informed consent and screening procedures, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_437161] supportive care (BSC). The randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_15006]; Geograph ic region (Asia vs. North 
America/Europe), Disease measurability (measurable vs. 
nonmeasurable ), Prior ramucirumab treatment (Yes vs. No), and 
Treatment therapy line (3rd vs. ≥4th).  
Randomized subjects will receive either the test product Apatinib  at 700 
Protocol No. LSK -AM301  Protocol version 5.0_20181116  
LSK Bio Partners, Inc.     CONFIDENTIAL     Page 12 of 13 mg/day plus BSC or Placebo plus BSC and will be evaluated at regular 
site visits, which will be made every [ADDRESS_437162] ’s withdra
wal of consent. If treatment 
related toxicity is detected, two steps  of dose reductions ( 600 mg and 
400 mg  for Apatinib ) are allowed during  the entire study period 
according to the dose adjustment plan (refer to Section 4.4 ) 
Tumor response and progression will be assessed every other cycle (8 
weeks interval) by a local imaging facility.  Patient treatment decisions will be made based on local  imaging r esults and investigator opi[INVESTIGATOR_351600].   
Scans will be 
obtained at baseline and throughout the study and will be analyzed 
post-study by a central imaging analysis facility.  Centrally imaging 
results will determine the patient ’s best tumor response and time of 
progression according to RECIST 1.1.  
Post-treatment follow -up visit will be made at 4 weeks after the end of 
treatment (EOT) and then survival follow -ups will follow at [ADDRESS_437163] or closure of the study.  
 Extension Period:  
Continued treatment with apatinib and best supportive care or best 
supportive care alone during the extension period of the study is only for those subjects that are taking either apatinib or placebo at the time of unblinding, respectively.   For all other subjects that have not been considered as reaching the end of study (i.e. subjects in survival follow -
up) and are not taking study medication at the time of unblinding, they will be followed for survival status only.   It is anticipated that less than 
40 subjects will be taking study medication at the time of unblinding of which less than 30 will be taking apatinib.  
 Subjects taking apatinib at the time of unblinding:  
After the End of the Study (EOS) when the study is unblinded, subjects  
still on apatinib treatment with best supportive care, if determined to be safe to continue therapy by [CONTACT_093],  may consent to continue 
this treatment until disease progression, intolerability, death, withdrawal 
of consent,  or, if none of those has occurred, apatinib becomes 
available 
through other methods acceptable to the applicable 
regulatory authority . Site visit and evaluat ion for safety should be

LSK Bio Partners, Inc.     CONFIDENTIAL     Page 13 of 14 performed approximately ev ery four weeks  (± 3 days) . Safety 
assessment may be performed more frequently , if clinically indicated. 
Tumor assessments will be performed per standard care approximately 
every [ADDRESS_437164]-treatment Follow -
up for safety, and Survival 
Follow -up as appropriate. A study schedule for subjects continuing 
apatinib treatment in the extension period is provided in Table 2. 
 Subjects taking placebo at the time of unblinding: 
Subjects  who are determined to be taking the placebo and best 
supportive care when the study is unblinded may consent to continue to be followed for survival status and continued best supportive care . 
For those subjects  that were taking  placebo, no End of Treatment visit 
is required. Best supportive care may be continued for patient
s no 
longer taking placebo, if appropriate , and only until other anti -cancer 
therapy is administered, disease progression, intolerability, death, or 
withdrawal of consent . The study schedule for subjects receiving only 
best supportive care in the extension period is to be determined by [CONTACT_351632].  
 Japan Specific Safety Run- In: 
The AM104 ethnic bridging study determined that there is no 
statistically significant difference in Japanese  ethnic popula tion 
pharmacokinetics as compared to Chinese and/or C aucasians that 
would make it unsafe to proceed at the study starting dose.  The 
AM104 study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 20 1 
mg of Apatinib in 18 healthy volunteers of each of three specific ethnic populations; Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian.  Initiation of enrollment 
in Japan will have a safety run- in approach to further confirm the safety 
of the study starting dose in this ethnic population. [Detail explanation is provided in Section 3.1.1]

Methods  Efficacy analysis 
The primary analysis  of OS will be conducted in the ITT population (all 
randomized subjects)  using a stratified (by [CONTACT_178204]) logrank test at the two-sided alpha= 0.[ADDRESS_437166] is not 
statistically significant, then the subsequent analyses will be 
exploratory rather than confirmatory.  
All other secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using tw o-sided 
tests at the alpha=0.05 level of significance, with no adjustments for 
multiplicity DCR will be analyzed using the same methodology as 
described for ORR.  
For the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Quality of Life Questionnai re-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ -C30) and EuroQol 
5-Dimension 5- Level (EQ -5D-5L) Questionnaire, the treatment groups 
will be compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models with 
treatment group and the randomization stratification variables as 
factors, and with the baseline value of the corresponding endpoint as a 
covariate.  
Safety analysis 
Safety parameter data will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_4676]. 
Summary tables will show incidence rates (number of subjects with at 
least one event) of AE, SAE , etc. , as well as summaries of severity 
(CTCAE  v4.03) and causal relationship. Change from baseline tables 
will be presented for clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs and

10 , 11 , 12  and 
median overall survival only reaches 9~ [ADDRESS_437187] other diseases which may limit the use of chemotherapy agents. 
Therefore, to improve disadvantages of the existing anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_351605], inconvenient administration method, limited survival extension, development of new chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_351606].

Drugs  developed for targeted therapy of gastric cancer can be functionally broken into 
(1) HER2 signaling pathway inhibitor s, (2) EGFR signaling pathway inhibitor s and (3) 
Neovascular  inhibitor s, while the inhibitors for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), mTOR 
and MET pathway have also been developed recently and are being studied for clinical 
application.14 
Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) among the molecular targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_351607]-HER2 monoclonal antibody, a HER2 signaling pathway inhibitor, and a combination 
therapy of Trastuzumab and chemotherapy in gastric cancer patients with HER2 overexpression has been approved by [CONTACT_55257], Europe’s EMEA and Korea in 2010. This was based on the result drawn from the ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) study in gastric cancer patients with HER2 overexpression that adding Trastuzumab significantly improves the duration of survival (13.8 months vs. 11.1 months, p = 0.0046).
15 
Gefitinib and Erlotinib, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) signaling pathway inhibitors, did not show a significant effect on gastric cancer as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
of EGFR -1.
16 , 17  In addition, cetuximab and panitumumab, anti -EGFR monoclonal 
antibodies, were assessed in phase III study. The median PFS for patients allocated capecitabine- cisplatin plus cetuximab was 4.4 months (95% CI 4.2 -5.5) compared with 
5.6 months (95% CI 5.1 -5.7) for patients allocated capecitabine- cisplatin alone (HR 1.09, 
95% CI 0.92- 1.29; p -value=0.32) in cetuximab phase III study, EXPAND study.
18 For 
panitumumab phase III study, REAL- 3 study, the median overall survival in patients 
allocated EOC (epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], oxaliplatin, capecitabine) was 11.3 months (95% CI 9.6- 13.0) 
compared with 8.8 months (95% CI 7.7- 9.8) in patients allocated modified- dose EO C 
plus panitumumab (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07- 1.76; p -value=0.013). These studies showed  
negative results.19 
However, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF R-2) inhibitor, 
Ramucirumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) and has recently obtained approval in the US and is being used because the mean overall survival was at least 20% greater for the Ramucirumab (5.2 months) group than for the Placebo group (3.8 months)

placebo plus paclitaxel (9.6 months vs. 7.4 months, HR 0.807 [95% CI 0.678- 0.962; p -
value=0.017]) in a phase III study (RAINBOW study). Based on the results, ramucirumab 
is recommended as a standard second- line treatment for patients with advanced gastric 
cancer.[ADDRESS_437188] to signaling pathways 
specific to cancer. Lately in addition, clinical studies on new compounds of tyrosine kinases receptor inhibitors which suppress vascular angiogenesis, growth and metastasis are being carried out. Vascular endothelial cell growth f actor (VEGF) is a 
circulating signal protein  and because it induces a number of vascular angiogenesis -
related responses such as cell proliferation or migration, vascular infiltration, and movement from bone marrow to stem cells when combined with a VEGF re ceptor 
(VEGFR), VEGF and VEGFR become physiologically important targets.  An anti -VEGF 
monoclonal antibody, Bevacizumab,  was evaluated in phase III study, and the AVAGAST 
study is the first antiangiogenic agents trial in gastric cancer. Even though the study did not show significant improvement of the OS (bevacizumab plus chemotherapy: 12.1 months vs. placebo plus chemotherapy: 10.1 months; HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.79 – 1.03; p-
value=0.1002]), adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy was associated with significant 
incre ases in both PFS (6.7 months vs. 5.3 months; HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.68 – 0.93]) and 
ORR (46.0% vs. 37.4%; p -value=0.0315) in the first- line treatment of advanced gastric 
cancer.

The VEGFR family is comprised of VEGFR1/Flt -1, VEGFR2/KDR/Flk -1 and 
VEGFR3/Flt -4. V arious inhibitors which target the VEGFR family, including sorafenib, 
vandetanib, cediranib, and sunitinib, have been developed to date.  These are all non -
specific VEGF receptor  small molecule  inhibitors . Sorafenib achieved an approval for 
advanced renal cancer25  and liver cancer26 . Sunitinib achieved approval for 
gastrointes tinal stromal tumor27 and advanced renal cell cancer28 and has been studied 
for advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.29  
1.2. General Information  
The family members of VEGF receptors include: VEGFR -1(Flt-1), VEGFR -2 (KDR/Flk -
1), VEGFR -3 (Flt -4). Vascular angiogenesis in tumors is mainly induced by [CONTACT_351639] -2 (KDR/Flk -l). VEGFR -[ADDRESS_437189] been several new drug candidates targeting inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity by [CONTACT_351640].  
Apatinib is an orally administered small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which selectively inhibits VEGFR -[ADDRESS_437190]. Clinical study results of Apatinib are summarized in the 
following. 
YN968D1 is the mesylate salt o f apatinib freebase.   Many prior studies were conducted 
referring to dose of apatinib as the weight of apatinib including the mesylate salt.  In this 
study and in future studies, LSK will refer to apatinib dose strength as the weight of the 
apatinib freebas e alone instead of weight of the apatinib mesylate salt.   The freebase 
dosage is approximately 81% of the mesylate dosage.   The formulation is the same.  
Referring to apatinib dose strength as freebase is more aligned with standards for 
referencing total active product.  
1)Phase I, dose escalation, PK study in subjects with advanced cancer
[ADDRESS_437191] 2007 to March 
2009, which enrolled 46 subjects at . Of these, 
19 subjects  were enrolled in  a dose- escalation study . Another  27 subjects were enrolled 
in the PK study. The subjects enrolled primarily were gastrointestinal tumor (73.9%). All 
subjects had received at least one prior chemotherapy  regimen , 84.7% had prior surgery  
and 27% had radiation treatment . Measurable lesions were documented in 45 of the 
subjects  at baseline. Subjects were treated for up to 56 days of continuous therapy and 
all subjects in the study received a total of 133 cycles of therapy .  
The study  was conducted at five dose levels (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg, 850 mg, and 
1,000 mg of YN968D1 [as apatinib mesylate] ). One (1) additional subject was included 
in the 250 mg -cohort due to withdrawal of consent of another participant. Two (2) DLTs 
at the dose level of 1,000 mg/day were documented. One (1) subject had Grade 3 
hypertension and the other had Grade 3 hand -foot syndrome (HFS). Three additional 
subjects were enrolled in the 850 mg group. None of the total six (6) subjects in the 850 mg-cohort experienced DLTs. Therefore, the MTD for this dosing schedule was 

Protocol No.  LSK- AM301  Protocol v ersion 5.0_20181116  
LSK Bio Partners, Inc.     CONFIDENTIAL    Page 34 of 35 determined to be 850 mg daily of YN968D1.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments were also conducted on eleven (11) subjects in the 750 
mg-single -dose cohort who continued to the 750 mg-multiple -dose cohort after a 7 -day-
washed- out period while one withdrew consent. Thus, the PK analysis population for 
single -dosing was n = 8 for 500 mg -cohort, n = 12 for 750 mg- cohort, n = 8 for 850 mg-
cohort (one subject from the dose- escalation cohort provided consent to participate in 
the PK cohort), and for multiple- dosing 750 mg- cohort (n = 11) for 56 days.  
The overall mean  pharmacokinetic parameters of YN968D1 after single and  multiple oral 
dose administration are summarized in Table 3 below. For single dose evaluation, C max 
was achieved in 3 to 4 hours after oral administration. The plasma level of YN968D1  
varied considerably between patients.  The concentration of YN968D1 in plasma  
increased with dose. C max and AUC 0-24 showed a dose- dependent increase at doses from 
500 to 850 mg, whereas increased slightly more than dose proportional ly at dose of 850 
mg dose , and showed high inter -individual variability . The e limination half -life of the 
terminal phase (t 1/2λz), estimated to be approximately 9 hours , was consistent over the 
three dose levels.  
For multiple -dose at 750 mg, the mean C max was 2,421 ng/mL on Day 1, which increased 
to 2,553 ng/mL by  [CONTACT_2006] 6 , and the mean AUC 0-24 was 19,399 ng·h/mL on Day 1, which 
increased to 25,449 ng·h/mL by [CONTACT_2006] 6. There was no further increase in Cmax and AUC 
beyond 6 days of multiple dosing, and this was similar for the mean elimination t1/2. 
Steady -state conditions were achieved by [CONTACT_2006] 6 , suggesting no accumulation during 56 
days  of once -daily dosing.

The safety population comprised  all subjects who had received at least 1 dose of 
YN968D1 (N=46). The most frequ ently observed adverse drug reactions were 
hypertension (69.5% , 29 grade 1-2 and 3  grade 3- 4), proteinuria (47.8% , 16 grade 1-2 
and 6 grade 3 -4), and hand- foot syndrome (45.6% , 15 grade 1-2 and 6 grade 3 -4). 
Hypertension w as generally manageable with antih ypertensive agent s. Approximately 
10 % of the subjects who developed HFS progressed to Grade 3. Other treatment -related 
AEs were generally mild or moderate in severity and were manageable. The treatment 
was discontinued for both of the two subjects who experienced DLT. After recovery, one  
(1) subject was able to reinitiate treatment at a reduced dose.  A total of [ADDRESS_437192] one cycle of YN968D1 at the initial dose. Four (4) subjects discontinued 
the treatment during Cycle 1, of which [ADDRESS_437193] in the 250 mg dose group due to disease progression and 3 in the 1,000 mg dose group due to intolerable toxicity. Eighteen (18) subjects had a dose reduction for different toxicities du ring the extended treatment ( 1 in

The results of this study show ed that YN968D1 was safe and well tolerated and exhibited 
substantial antitumor activity at the YN968D1 (apatinib mesylate) dose of 750 mg and 
850 mg once daily . 
2) Phase II clinical study in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer31 
In the phase II study conducted in patients with advanced or metastatic  gastric cancer 
who did not respond to the second- line anticancer therapy or had disease recurred, a 
total of 144 patients were randomized to 3 groups; placebo group (Group A), 850mg of YN968D1 (as apatinib mesylate) qd group (Group B) and 425mg of YN968D1  bid group 
(Group C).  
Median overall survival (OS) of Group A, B and C was 2.50 months (95 % CI, 1.87 -3.70 
months), 4.83 months (95 % CI, 4.03- 5.97 months) and 4.27 months (95 % CI, 3.83- 4.77 
months), respectively, and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.40 months (95 % CI, 1.20 -1.83 months), 3.67 months (95 % CI, 2.17 -6.80 months) and 3.20 months (95 % 
CI, 2.37 -4.53 months), respectively. Both the PFS (P <0.001) and OS (P <0.001, P = 
0.0017) showed a statistically significant difference between the YN968D1 group and the 
Placebo group. Nine patients had a PR (Group B n=3, Group C n=6). Toxicities were 
tolerable. Toxicities of Grade 3 or over were hand -foot syndrome and hypertension, and 
hematologic toxicities of Grade 3 or over were rare. Considerin g the safety profile of 
YN968D1 at the two dose levels of 850 mg and 425 mg, the dosing regimen of 850 mg 
Protocol No.  LSK- AM301  Protocol v ersion 5.0_20181116  
LSK Bio Partners, Inc.     CONFIDENTIAL    Page 37 of 38 once daily of YN968D1 was recommended. To sum up, YN968D1 increased PFS and 
OS in patients with advanced gastric cancer who failed to second- line or higher 
anticancer therapy.  
3) Phase III clinical study in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer32 
A multicenter, randomized, double- blind, phase  III study  was conducted in patients who 
failed to second- line therapy. The study was designed as 28 days/cycle, consisting of 
YN968D1 850 mg (as apatinib mesylate) group and Placebo group. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was overall survival. Randomization was done centrally and was stratified by 
[CONTACT_351641] (≤2 or >2). A total of 2 67 randomly assigned subjects were  
included in FAS population; 176 in the YN968D1 group and 91 in the Placebo group. As 
for the efficacy, mean overall survival was statistically greater for the YN968D1 group 
than for the Placebo  group (6.5 months  versus 4.7 months ; HR= 0. 709; 95% CI 
(0.537~0.937 ); p< 0.01 49). mPFS also showed the same result (2.6 months  versus 1.8 
months ; HR= 0. 444, 95%CI (0. 331~0. 595), P<0.001). ORR was 2.84% and 0.00% for 
the YN968D1 group and the Placebo group, respectively. As for the safety, YN968D1  
was mostly controlled by [CONTACT_351642]. The most common 
adverse events  were hand- foot skin reaction (HFSR), proteinuria and hypertension. In 
conclusion, the efficacy and safety of YN968D1 [ADDRESS_437196] of treatment at 700 mg/day  of 
YN968D1 (as apatinib mesylate) , which was within the maximum tolerated dose in the 
phase I study30, in terms of overall survival  (OS) , progression free survival  (PFS) , tumor 
response rate, disease control rate and quality of life. The target population will be 
advanced and metastatic gastric cancer patients who have failed approved standard 
treatment s (disease progression or intolerant to available approved dr ugs).  
YN968D1 is known to selectively inhibit VEGFR -2 and angiogenesis of cancer. Various 
laboratory tests showed results that YN968D1 highly selectively inhibits protein tyrosine 
kinase VEGFR -2/KDR (IC 50 about 1 nM) receptor, and YN968D1  demonstrated an 
anticancer effect in gastric cancer cell line (NCI -N87 cell line) implanted -nude mouse. In 
mouse with hypodermic implantation of colorectal, liver, kidney, breast or non-small cell 
cancer cells, YN968D1  also demonstrated an anticancer effect. Also, a combination

LSK Bio Partners, Inc.     CONFIDENTIAL    Page [ADDRESS_437197] common side effects were hypertension, proteinuria, and hand -foot 
syndrome but were all mild to moderate in severity and were manageable. In terms of 
effectiveness, a total 83.8% of patients had disease controlled; partial response in 18.9% and stable disease in 64.9%. Out of [ADDRESS_437198] of increasing overall survival compared to the Placebo group in patients with advanced gastric cancer

outcome, Apatinib has been approved in China for treatment of advanced gastric cancer in 2014. 
Previous studies show clinical benefits in OS and PFS, however, there is no more 
treatment option for patients who failed approved standards therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  As described 
above, Apatinib has shown potential survival benefit in patients with gastric  cancer ; 
therefore, its efficacy and safety need to be ascertained in this controlled and properly powered phase I II study. This study will be the steppi[INVESTIGATOR_351608] a treatment agent for advanced and metastatic gastric cancer . 
Moreover, the data to be obtained from this study will contribute to our understanding of this disease.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a prospective, randomized, double- blinded, placebo- controlled, multinational, 
multicenter, parallel -group, phase I II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib  
plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) compared to Placebo plus BSC in patients with 
advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who failed two or more prior trea tment regimens . 
After informed consent and screening procedures, eligible subjects will be randomized 
in a 2 :[ADDRESS_437199] supportive care 
(BSC).  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_15006] : Geographic region 
(Asia vs. North America/Europe), Disease measurability  (measurable vs. 
nonmeasurable ), Prior ramucirumab treatment (Yes vs. No), and Treatment therapy line 
(3rd vs. ≥4th). 
Randomized subjects will receive either the test product Apatinib (freebase) at 700 
mg/day plus BSC or Placebo plus BSC and will be evaluated at regular site visits, which will be made every [ADDRESS_437200] ’s withdrawal of 
Protocol No.  LSK- AM301  Protocol v ersion 5.0_20181116  
LSK Bio Partners, Inc.     CONFIDENTIAL    Page 40 of 41 consent.  If treatment related toxicity is detected, two steps  of dose reductions ( 600 mg, 
400 mg for Apatinib ) are allowed during the entire study period according to the dose 
adjustment plan ( refer to S ection 4.4 ). 
The intent of the study is to have subjects receive a dose every day continuously. The 
actual dose received will be captured and the start and stop of dosing will be used to 
calculate dose intensity and duration of treatment. A cycle length is determined by [CONTACT_351643], whichever  is appropriate for the individual 
subject . Dose interruptions  such as for management of adverse events may elongate 
the cycle days as needed, however, the subject  should be evaluated at reasonable 
intervals to ensure the subjects  safety such as follow- up for adverse events and 
laboratory value monitoring. While continuously receiving study  investigational product, 
per the protocol schedul e, subjects should be evaluated at regular site visits, which will 
be made approximately every 2 weeks as described above.  
Tumor response and progression will be assessed every other  cycle (8 weeks interval) 
by a local imaging facility. Patient treatment decisions will be made based on local imaging results and investigator opi[INVESTIGATOR_351609]. Scans will be obtained at baseline and throughout the study and will be analyzed post-
study by a central imaging analysis facility. Centrally imaging results will determine the patient ’s best tumor response and time of progression according to RECIST 1.1. 
Post-treatment follow -up visit will be made at 4 weeks after the end of treat ment (EOT) 
and then survival follow -ups will follow at 8-week interval s till the death of the subject or 
closure of the study.   More frequent intervals of survival follow -up may be performed to 
provide for the most accurate survival data at the time of interim and final analysis  or 
during periodic  updates . 
In this trial, approximately 459 subjects will be enrolled (among them, the anticipated number of Japanese patients is at least 50 and up to 100 will be enrolled.) 
The study data will be analyzed when the required number of events (approximately 325 
deaths) are observed. This is projected to occur approximately  [ADDRESS_437201] is randomized. All subjects will be treated and/or followed after randomization 
until the study data analysis is performed, and then they will be monitored for survival 
status until death. 
Subjects  continuing to benefit from apatinib treatment, after final analysis and

LSK Bio Partners, Inc.     CONFIDENTIAL    Page [ADDRESS_437202] at the time of unblinding  will be asked to consent for 
continued survival follow- up during the extension phase of the study.   Subjects who 
were off treatment at the time  of unblinding, but are still participating in the study (i.e. in 
survival follow -up) do not require a new consent after unblinding to continue participation.  
3.1.1.  Additional Information for Japan Specific Safety Run- In 
The AM104 ethnic bridging study determined that there is no statistically  significant 
difference in Japanese ethnic population pharmacokinetics as compared to Chinese 
and/or Caucasian that would make it unsafe to proceed at the study starting dose. The 
AM104 study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 201 mg of Apatinib in 
18 healthy volunteers of each of three specific ethnic populations; Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian.  Initiation of enrollment in Japan will have a safety run -in approach to 
further confirm the safety of the study starting dose in this ethnic population. Initially, in Japan, only 6 patients will be enrolled and assigned either Apatinib or Placebo to 
investigate the safety at the same starting dose and with the same randomization/enrollment criteria as all other study patients. The treatment assignment, as with all patients, will not be known to any study personnel with the following exceptions. During the observation period, the independent data monitoring committee or an appropriately unblinded and separate study personnel who would perform no other study 
activity or duties  that would jeopardize the integrity of the study, will determine whether

observed for a minimum of 14 days of therapy.  If less than 3 patients are randomized 
to Apatinib treatment, 3 more patients (bringing the total to 9 patients) may b e enrolled 
immediately to ensure that the DLT evaluation in Japan patients is performed on at least 3 Apatinib treated patients.  
If no DLT occurs during the DLT evaluation period (at least 0/3 Apatinib treated patients), 
the study may proceed in Japan with further enrollment per protocol and the IDMC and PMDA will be notified.  
If there is only 1 DLT during the DLT evaluation period (at least 1/3), another [ADDRESS_437205] 6 Apatinib treated patients are observed (at most 1/6 Apatinib treated patients), the study may proceed in Japan with further enrollment per protocol and the I DMC and PMDA will be 
notified.  
If there are 2 DLT events in the 14 day DLT evaluation period ( either at most 2/[ADDRESS_437206] 2/6 Apatinib treated patients), the enrollment in Japan will temporarily stop until a decision to discontinue or continue enrollment with or without modifications is decided after consultation with the IDMC and PMDA.  
For the purposes of the Japanese safety run -in, a DLT is defined as any of the following 
events assessed by [CONTACT_351644] 1 through Day 14.

3.3. Discussion of Study Design  
This study is a prospective, randomized, double-b linded, placebo- controlled, 
multinational, multicenter, parallel -group, phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of Apatinib in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.  
In the Chinese phase I study30, Apatinib mesylate demonstrated noteworthy  efficacy with 
[ADDRESS_437218] frequent adverse events were hypertension, proteinuria and 
hand- foot syndrome, which were mild to moderate in severity and manageable. The 
phase I efficacy data showed that partial response was seen in 18.9% of patients and 
stable disease in 64.9%, totaling an 83.8% disease control rate. In other words, out of 22 patients with gastric- colorectal cancer in total who were included in this phase I study, 
18 subjects had disease control including 4 subjects with partial response, which indicates an excellent efficacy profile. In the phase II and III studies recently conducted 
in China  as mentioned above, Apatinib demonstrated an excellent efficacy that it 
increased overall survival compared to the Placebo group  when administered to patients 
with advanced gastric cancer who failed two or more lines of therapy. Based on the 
results from the clinical studies, this phase III study is planned to confirm the effects of 
Apatinib in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. The subjects will be 
randomized at  2:1 ratio to receive either Apatinib  (freebase) 700  mg qd or Placebo qd 
and then the safety and efficacy will be assessed during the treatment period.  
In addition, this study has been des igned as a double- blind, placebo- controlled, and 
multinational, multicenter  study. The target population—advanced or metastatic gastric 
cancer  patients who have failed standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] —is an appropriate candidate who 
will possibly benefit from Apatinib  treatment considering there is no recommended  or 
accessible further  treatment. To reserve objectivity and credibility of the study results, a 
Protocol No. LSK- AM301 Protocol v ersion 5.0_20181116
LSK Bio Partners, Inc.     CONFIDENTIAL   Page 48 of 49double- blind design has been adopted. Patients will be stratified according to the 
geographic region (Asia vs. North America/Europe) . Region was employed as a 
stratification factor in order to avoid an imbalance among regions in the randomization 
to the Apatinib group and the Placebo group. In addition, disease measurability
(measurable vs. nonmeasurable), Prior ramucirumab treatment (Yes vs. No), and 
Treatment therapy line (3rd vs. ≥4th) will be employed as stratification factors. The primary 
endpoint is overall survival (OS), which is considered the most reliable cancer endpoint
andis the preferred endpoint from a regulatory perspective. Thus, OSwas selected as 
theprimary endpoint in this phase III trial. EORTC and EQ -5D questio nnaires were 
selected in order to assess the quality of life of subjects because these questionnaires
are being used in cancer patients worldwide.

3.4.7.  Extension period study visits  
After the study is unblinded and the extension period of the study begins, all subjects 
taking study medication at that time should have their study treatment  assignment 
unblinded and determined to be either apatinib or placebo. For subjects that are not 
taking study medication at the time of unblinding, the investigator may request to know 
their treatment assignment.  Subjects who have stopped taking study medication or best 
supportive care prior to unblinding will not be given the option to restart taking apatinib 
or begin receiving best supportive care.   
Subjects taking placebo at the time of unblinding:  
Subjects  who are determined to be taking the  placebo and best supportive care when 
the study is unblinded may consent to continue to be followed for survival status and to 
continue best supportive care. For those subjects  that were taking  placebo, no End o f 
Treatment visit is required. Best supportive care may be continued for patients no longer taking placebo, if appropriate, and only until other anti -cancer therapy is administered, 
disease progression, intolerability, death, or withdrawal of consent.  No A E’s or SAE’ s will 
be gathered for subjects receiving only best supportive care.  Survival status will continue 
to be requested  until withdrawal of consent. The study schedule for subjects receiving 
only best supportive care in the extension period is to be determined by [CONTACT_351648].  
   Subjects taking apatinib at the time of unblinding:  
After the End of the Study (EOS) when the study is unblinded, for those subjects taking 
apatinib, if the investigator determines that it is safe to continue apatinib treatment, they should obtain consent from the subject to continue to administer apatinib and perform 
safety evaluations, tumor assessments and survival follow -up. Subjects will continue 
apatinib treatment until disease progression, intolerability, death, withdrawal of consent, or, if none of those has occurred, apatinib becomes available through other methods

Possible ’ causality . 
・ In case of Grade I non- hematologic al treatment related  toxicity  and Grade I or II 
hematolo gic toxicity, no dose adjustment needs to be done.  
・ In case of Grade II non- hematologic al treatment related toxicity, study treatment is 
continued without modification and with required symptomatic  treatment. The 
investigator may reduce the dose by [CONTACT_351628] a significant potential of worsening should be avoided. 
・ In case of potentially related or related anti- angiogenic treatment Grade II AEs, pre -
emptive dose reduction is recommended and the investigator may reduce the dose by [CONTACT_351652]. If the AE Grade stabilizes  or decreases 
with dose reduction, the investigator may choose to increase the dose by [CONTACT_351653]. The investigator may decrease or increase the dose

5.2.1.  Tumor Evaluation (Chest, abdominal and pelvic CT/MRI)   
Tumor imaging will be further explained in an Imaging manual. A CT should be used with 
slice thickness ≤  [ADDRESS_437237] (or PET -CT) scan o r MRI —whichever 
is used, the same method and the same equipment should be used throughout the study —at the following time points:  
・ Within 14 days before  Baseline visit (baseline measurement)  
・ The end of every other cycle  thereafter 
・ End of treatment (EOT) visit
1) 
1) If CT/MRI is performed within [ADDRESS_437238]/MRI, tumor evaluation is not required at EOT.  
If a subject is withdrawn from the IP treatment due to any reason except for disease progression , tumor evaluation will be continued every [ADDRESS_437239] or if there is concern about too much radiation exposure. In addition to these planned tumor evaluations, unscheduled imaging is allowed as clinically indicated at the Investigator's discretion. The key images to be used for determination of disease progression will be reviewed by a central imaging analysis facility based on objective tumor assessments using the RECIST guidelines (version 1.1). 
The tumor response criteria is presented in Appendix 2.  
If a diagnosis cannot be made with CT/MRI due to atypi[INVESTIGATOR_351602], primary or metastatic biopsy is recommended. Subsequent biopsies are carried out based on the investigator ’s discretion, but it should be considered in case of growth or 
change in the enhancement pattern identified during follow -up. Histop athologic 
examination of the biopsy specimen should be assessed by [CONTACT_351635].  
5.2.2.  Patient Reported Outcome  
Following two questionnaires will be used as tools to collect patient reported outcomes.

In addition, plasma samples for sVEGFR -1, sVEGFR2 and sVEGFR3 will be taken .  
Guidelines for collection and handling of blood specimen and materials will be provided 
by [CONTACT_4209] ’s designee.  Each study site collects and ships the specimens 
to the central laboratory according to the guidelines provided.  
Genetic test will be conducted including the gene information that specifies the patient and will be used only for research purpose. Therefore, the results of genetic test will not be disclosed to the patient, patient ’s family, investigators, or other thir d parties  and will 
not be recorded in the patient ’s medical record.   
In Japan, if the patient is under 20 years old and the patient or legal guardian withdraws  
consent, the collection and sampling of blood sample will be stopped.  However, the information  and blood samples already collected and sampled can be used to evaluate 
the result of the clinical trial.

fully comply with the study requirements or if any of the study procedures are deemed potentially harmful to the subject.  
If any of the following  criteria is met during the treatment period, the study treatment will 
be discontinued.  
1. Subject withdraws his/her consent . 
2. The development of disease progression  is confirmed  according to the RECIST 
guideline (version 1.1)  that makes it inappropriate to continue with study 
treatment according to the investigator ’s discretion or consent for continued 
treatment beyond RECIST confirmed disease progression is not obtained. (see 
Section 6.3)  
3. Clinical symptoms determined to be due to disease progression that makes it 
inappropriate to continue with study treatment  according to the investigator ’s 
discretion or consent for continued treatment beyond clinical symptoms that are determined to be due to disease progression is not obtained. (see Section 6.3)  
4. Onset of CTCAE grade ≥ [ADDRESS_437243] cannot be ruled out.  (However, the judgment on whether 
or not to continue the treatment will be made by [CONTACT_093].) 
5. Not having received a dose of the investigational product within the past 
consecutive [ADDRESS_437244] provide documentation of 
their opi[INVESTIGATOR_351620] : 
• The patient demonstrates investigator -assessed potential for clinical benefit and 
does  not have rapid disease progression. 
• It is safe to continue study drug and the patient, by [CONTACT_351660], is 
tolerant of any continuing adverse events . 
• ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 or stable ECOG performance status of 2 with no signs of rapid deterioration (ECOG status of [ADDRESS_437245] 30 days from beginning of continuation study treatment). 
• The patient has a life expectancy of more than 30 days.  
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent 
serious  complications of disease progression (e.g., CNS metastases) . 
• A radiographic assessment/scan should be performed approximately 8 weeks (±7 days) , or earlier if the patient is exhibiting symptoms that may 
indicate continued progression,  after initial Investigator -assessed progression to 
determine whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size or continued 
progres sive disease. The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by 
[CONTACT_351661] . 
For the patients who continue receive study therapy beyond progression, further  
progression is defined as an additional 15 % increase in tumor burden from time of initial  
progression. This includes  an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/or 
the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial progression or

evaluations to ensure the subjects safety and continued benefit may be performed at the investigator ’s discretion .  
After the  decision to end study treatment permanently, an end of treatment (EOT)  
examination will be performed (at completion/discontinuation) and the subject will 
proceed to the post-treatment follow -up and survival follow -up. However, subjects in 
either treatment group will be withdrawn from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:  
1. Subject withdraws his/her consent on the follow -up period. 
2. Subject is lost to follow -up. 
Post-treatment follow -up can be carried out before withdrawal if the subject agrees to it. 
Data that have already been collected on withdrawn subjects will be retained and used for analysis but no new data will be collected after withdrawal.  When subjects withdraw 
from the study, they will be asked whether the study center can continue to contact [CONTACT_351662]. If this consent is withdrawn, publicly accessible records may be used for documentation of death.  
6.4. Handling Early Withdrawals 
In any case of early withdrawal from the study, the date and reason should be recorded in the subject ’s eCRF and source documents. If the reason for early withdrawal was an 
AE, the outcome of the AE should be reported according to Secti on 7.[ADDRESS_437247] numbers (screening number and randomization number).  
6.5. Medical C are After the End of Treatment  for Withdrawn Subjects

7.3. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All SAE must be repo rted to the sponsor without del ay from  the time of investigator ’s 
acknowledgement  on the event, whether or not the SAE has a causal relationship to the 
investigational product. The investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/IEC of the 
SAE, as per local requirements. If a non -serious AE becomes serious, this and other 
relevant follow -up information must also be provided to the sponsor without delay, 
whether or not it has a causal relationship to the investigational product. All SAE will be 
recorded in the eCRF. The site should fax or e -mail the SAE Report Form  within [ADDRESS_437250] the following information: 
• Study title, protocol number, and sponsor name  
• Reporter’s name, investigator’s name, and contact [CONTACT_6227]

7.4. Exposure During Pregnancy  
Apatinib is not intended for use during pregnancy or lactation. Reproductive studies in 
animals have not been performed to date with Apatinib and there have been no data 
regarding the exposure during human pregnancy. Angiogenesis is critical to fetal 
development and the inhibition of angiogenesis following admini stration of Apatinib  is 
likely to result in adverse effects on pregnancy. If a potential subject is a female of 
childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum)  must be obtained 
before she can be enrolled as a subject. A female subject or a male subject ’s female 
sexual partner must use effective contraception consistently and correctly during the study and for at least [ADDRESS_437252] ’s female sexual partner must not  
breastfeed while receiving the investigational products during this study and for at least 
[ADDRESS_437253] ’s female sexual 
partners,  during the study period and for at least [ADDRESS_437254] ’s treatment assignment following unblinding procedure and discontinuing  study

LSK Bio Partners, Inc.     CONFIDENTIAL    Page 80 of 81 8.3. Statistical Analysi s 
LSK Global Pharma Services Co., Ltd. will perform statistical analysis. Outlines of 
analysis are described below, and details of analysis methods will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Version 1.0 of the SAP will be finalized before EOS.   
8.3.1.  General Principles of Data Analysis  
Statistical analyses will be performed using  SAS software (SAS Institute, SAS Circle, 
Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) and all statistical tests, unless otherwise specified, will be t wo-sided at 
a 5% significance level.   
8.3.2.  Analysis Population 
Data obtained from subjects in this study will be analyzed by [CONTACT_181096] ( ITT) set, 
safety set, full analysis set (FAS) or per protocol set (PPS).  
・ ITT set  consists of data from all subjects who are randomized.  In the ITT set, subjects 
will be included in the group to which they were randomized. The analysis for primary 
endpoint, OS and the secondary endpoint s of PFS  and ORR  will be conducted in the 
ITT set. 
・ Safety set consists of data from all subjects who received at least one dose of Apatinib  
or placebo. In the Safety set, subjects will be included in the group based on the 
treatment that was received. Safety data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_351664].  
・ FAS consists of data from all subjects who received at least one dose of the Apatinib  
or placebo. The FAS will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
・ PPS consists of data from subjects included in FAS who completed the study per 
protocol without major violation such as inclusion /exclusion criteria violation and use 
of prohibited concomitant medication during the study.  The PPS will be used for all  
efficacy  analyses.  
8.3.3.  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_351665] . The number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, 
minimum and maximum will be presented for continuous data, and the number and percentage (%) of subjects will be presented for categorical data.  
8.3.4.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted  using the ITT set .

LSK Bio Partners, Inc.     CONFIDENTIAL    Page 81 of 82 Overall Survival (OS): Time from randomization to death. Subjects alive or lost to follow -
up at the end of study (EOS) are censored.  
The comparison of OS between the two treatment groups will be performed with a 
stratified logrank test at the two- sided alpha=0.[ADDRESS_437255] ratio, a Cox proportional hazards regression model will 
be fitted with treatment group and the randomization stratification  variables as  factors 
[Geographic region (Asia vs. North America/Europe), Disease measurability  
(measurable vs. nonmeasurable), Prior ramucirumab treatment (Yes vs. No), and 
Treatment therapy line (3rd vs. ≥4th)].  
Kaplan- Meier estimates will be calculated for each treatment group to construct the 
survival curve. The median overall survival and its 95 % CI will also be presented.  
8.3.5.  Key Secondary Efficacy Analys es 
If the primary analysis of OS is statistically significant, then the key secondary endpoints of PFS and ORR will be analyzed using a fixed- sequence testing procedure.  These 
analyses will be conducted using the ITT set.  First, PFS will be analyzed using the same 
statistical methods that are used in the primary efficacy analysis of OS . If the analysis of 
PFS is statistically significant, then ORR will be analyzed using the Cochran- Mantel -
Haenszel test s tratified by [CONTACT_94487].  However, if a prior 
test is not statistically significant, then the subsequent analyses will be exploratory rather than confirmatory.  
 
・ Progression Free Survival (PFS): Time from randomization to either radiological 
progression (determined by [CONTACT_351666] ) or death from 
any cause. Subjects alive and free of progression at the end of study (EOS) are 
censored.  Option s for PFS assessment for each situation are as shown in Table 
7, and censoring date will be based on the last tumor assessment date. 
・ Objective Response Rate (ORR) : Percentage of subjects with a Best Overall 
Response (determined by [CONTACT_351667])  of Complete 
Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) . 
 
For PFS, the same statistical method that is used in primary efficacy analysis (OS) will be performed.

LSK Bio Partners, Inc.     CONFIDENTIAL    Page 85 of 86 unblinded results of the interim analysis. The IDMC can also convene when unexpected 
adverse drug reaction with a Grade 3 or more (based on NCI- CTCAE 4.0 3) are observed.  
The IDMC can also convene, if necessary, to ensure appropriate review of the Japan specific safety run -in. 
8.4.2.  Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be conducted with collected clinical data when approximately 163 
(approximately 50% of the required 325 events) events are observed. All planned study 
procedures such as pa tient enrollment, treatment and follow -up visit should be performed 
regardless of the interim analysis. If it is necessary to change the timing of the interim analysis, in consultations with sponsor, the IDMC can change interim analysis time and its corresponding statistical criteria for early termination.  
The interim analysis will assess the primary efficacy endpoint. The IDMC will review the result s of the interim analysis  and recommend to the sponsor whether or not to terminate 
the trial for futility . Final decision regarding study termination will be made by [CONTACT_456].  
The IDMC and statisticians involved in the interim analysis should keep the interim 
analysis result completely confidential. The result s of the interim analysis should be kept 
unknown to all staff involved in the conduct of the trial. If early termination is decided, the IDMC delivers the interim analysis report to the sponsor after the official unblinding procedure . 
Early termination will be considered if the interim analysis is futile, that is when the calculated conditional power based on primary efficacy endpoint is less than 0.2. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_351624] -I error, thus Type I -error 
adjustment is not needed.

into the primary data set for analysis after the designated EOS date and until unblinding has occurred. Any safety data after the designated EOS date should be entered in the extension period EDC system when it becomes available.  
11.2.  Documentation of Study Results 
All original eCRF data captured in the EDC system and their copy reproduced accurately and completely from the original data will be saved in CDs or other storage media.  A 
copy of the completed eCRF data for their subjects will be provided to each site at the 
end of the study.  
12. ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION  
12.1.  Patient Injury and Insurance 
In general, if a patient is injured as a direct result of the investigational products , the 
sponsor  or its contracted insurance company  will pay for reasonable and necessary 
medical treatment for the injury . If laws or regulations of the locality in which the study is 
taking place require additional payment of expenses, the s ponsor should  comply with 
such laws or regulations. Where applic able, the s ponsor will arrange  for specific 
insurance coverage . If health damage occurred in patient participating the clinical trial 
due to the willful or gross negligence of investigator ’s site, indemnification will be 
discussed based on the contract with the site. The indemnification for the health damage

numbers will be used in the CRFs. Source documents may or may not be de- identified 
for inspection/monitoring, however, any documents (pathology reports, radiology reports, 
etc.) that are provided for the sponsors record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_351626] ’s name [CONTACT_351681] ’s 
name [CONTACT_351682] (i.e., subject 
number) is attached. The subjects should be informed that all study materials will be kept in strict confidence. The signed ICFs will be retained by [CONTACT_351672]. By [CONTACT_12142], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_351627]. The subjects shall be informed that the sponsor ’s 
representative, IRBs or other governments  including Korea, U .S and EU,  etc. may audit 
the subject ’s medical records for verification of collected information and any information 
accessed during the audit will be handled strictly confidential.  
12.3.  Record Retention  
Essential documents should be retained until 2 years , 3 years (for Korean sites) , or as 
long as required by [CONTACT_351673] a marketing application is approved for 
the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years , 3 years (for 
Korean sites), or as long as required by [CONTACT_351674].  At the end of such period, the investigator

LSK Bio Partners, Inc.    CONFIDENTIAL    Page 96 of 97 Appendix 2: Tumor Response  Criteria  
Tumor assessment will be performed based on the revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1)   
[Reference: Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et al., New response evaluation criteria in solid 
tumours: Revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1), European Journal of Cancer 2009;45:228- 247] 
 
1. Baseline assessment  
The baseline tumor lesions assessed within 14 days before randomization will be categorized as measurable lesions (lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension as ≥10 mm) or as non -measurable lesions (all other lesions, including lesions <10mm in longest 
diameter, infiltrating type of GC , and truly non- measurable lesions ). Specific criteria for 
determination for measurability will be provided in a separate imaging guideline.  
All measurable lesions should be identified as target lesions, and should be evaluated by [CONTACT_351676].  2. Definitions  
Measurable lesions: must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter 
in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of ; 
・ [ADDRESS_437272] /MRI  scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
・ 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable)  
・ [ADDRESS_437273] X -ray 
 
Non-measurable lesions : All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm 
or pathological lymph nodes with ≥  10 to < 15 mm short axis) , as well as truly non- measurable 
lesions. Lesions considered truly non- measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin 
or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_351677] : All measura ble lesions up to a maximum of five lesions in total and two lesions 
per organ with the greatest size (a long axis for non- nodal lesions and a short axis for nodal 
lesions) should be identified as target lesions. Target lesions should be representative of all involved organs and in addition be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements (with large lesions that are difficult to measure avoided).  
 Non-target lesions: All lesions not selected as target lesions will be handled as non- targe t 
lesions, regardless of whether measurement is possible. Multiple non- target lesions in the 
same organ or site may be recorded as a single item (e.g., multiple enlarged pelvic lymph

3. Response criteria  
 Table 1. Response Criteria of Target Lesions  
Response of  
Target Lesions  Definition  
Complete response ( CR) The disappearance of all target lesions  and reduction in short 
axis of any nodal target lesions  to < 10 mm  
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions, taking as a reference the b aseline sum 
diameters  
Stable Disease ( SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as a reference the smallest sum diameter while on study .  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).

pathological in size (<10mm short axis).  
non-CR/non -PD Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal upper limits  
PD Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions 
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).

disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease 
must have reappeared after CR). The best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘ CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions 
were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

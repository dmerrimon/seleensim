Study Title : Decision Making Support for Parents and Caregivers  
 
Short Title:  Decision Making Support  
 
Study Objective .  
 
To determine  the feasibility  and acceptability  of a tool to support decision making for parents 
of critically ill children.  
 
Study Overview.  
 
The feasibility study will use a single -arm design. All critically ill infants for whom a 
serious decision is anticipated will be screened for enrollment. We  will enroll  up to 40 
infants,  their parent(s),  and their clinician(s).  A study team member will deliver the tool, 
discuss its use with parents, and answer parent questions as they arise. We will survey 
parents at baseline. Parents and clinicians will be surveyed and interviewed after utiliz ing 
the tool.  
 
Measures.   
 
Prior  to implementation  of this decision  aid in a prospective  randomized trial, we must 
first determine whether 1) study procedures are feasible and 2) the intervention is 
acceptable to parents and clinicians.  
 
Feasibility will be defined as 1) enrollment rate of ≥ 50% and 2) complete data collection 
rate of ≥ 80%. Parent and clinician acceptability will be measured using s elf-report survey 
measures, adapted from prior work. Additional  outcomes will include preparation for 
decision making, parent decisional conflict, regret, and satisfaction, perception  of feeling  
heard  and understood,  and psychological  distress.  Preparati on for decision making will 
be measured using the PrepDM. Decisional conflict and regret will be measured by [CONTACT_761877] (DCS) and the Decisional Regret Scale (DRS); perception of 
feeling heard and understood will be measured by [CONTACT_837476] (FHAU); parent psychological distress will be measured using PROMIS -29. 
 
Data  collection.   
 
The infant’s  chart  will be reviewed  and relevant  data extracted.  We will also document 
recruitment feasibility data. Parent baseline surveys will include demographic information 
and measures of psychological distress. Post-intervention surveys will be given to parents 
and clinicians following use of the tool. Clinician surveys will include meas ures of decision 
aid acceptability. Parent surveys will include measures of decision aid acceptability, 
decisional satisfaction, conflict and regret, perception of feeling heard and understood, 
preparation for decision making, and psychological distress.  
 
Parents and clinicians will be invited to complete semi -structured interviews, with content 
targeting acceptability of the decision aid.  Survey  data will be collected  and stored  via 
REDCap.  Qualitative  data will be analyzed  using  NVIVO.  
 
Study participants.  
 
Study  participants  will include  infants, parent s, and clinician s. Study  team  members  will 
screen  unit lists for potential  eligible  patients.  
 
Infant  inclusion  criteria  will include  1) age < 1 year,  2) admission  to a critical  care unit, 
and 3) an anticipated serious health care decision, defined as 1) a decision about 
initiating, not initiating, or withdrawing life sustaining treatment or chronic life -sustaining 
treatment (e.g. tracheostomy) and/or 2) a decision about major surgery and/or medical 
therapy.  
 
All parents of eligible infants will be considered for inclusion. Parent exclusion criteria  
will include  1) age < 18 years,  2) hearing  or speech  impairment,  and 3) non -English 
speakers.  
 
All clinicians  of eligible  infants will  be considered  for inclusion.  
 
Subject Recruitment and Compensation.  
 
We anticipate  up to 40 infants,  60 parents,  and 40 clinicians  will be enrolled  in this study.  
 
Patients  and parents:  We will recruit  from the Duke  Intensive  Care  Nursery, Pediatric 
Intensive Care Unit, and Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.  
 
A study team member  will communicate with  the unit about  1) eligible patients and 
2) approaching  the family  about  their willingness  to speak  with research  staff about the 
study. A waiver of HIPPA authorization has been requested to allow identification  of 
prospective  participants.  A member  of the study  team  will approach eligible families to 
introduce the study to the family. For infants enrolled, parents will be compensated $100 for 
completion of all study procedures. Clinicians will be compensated $[ADDRESS_1163115] participated in studies 
involving interviews about highly emotional topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. We will use several strategies to 
minimize the possibility of increasing distress, including 1) keepi[INVESTIGATOR_837472], the interviewer may 
offer rest breaks and direct the interview in and out  of the sensitive  area,  and 2) providing  
immediate  therapeutic  intervention  when needed. A  study team member with interview 
experience or the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_837473]. Should a parent become upset 
during an interview or survey completion, the stud y team member collecting the data will 
allow the parent to stop and encourage  them  to talk about their feelings. If a parent 
remains upset, the research staff member will stay with the parent and help them to 
contact [CONTACT_837477] a communit y mental health professional about their concerns. 
As part of routine clinical care, a social worker is assigned to each patient and family. 
After each parent interview, parents will be reminded that if they have concerns they wish 
to discuss, they ca n contact [CONTACT_837478], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_837474], or 
community mental health professional. The parents will be given information on how to 
contact [CONTACT_837479], if they prefer, the research staff will contact a 
profess ional for them. For concerns or questions about the study, parents will be given 
phone numbers for the investigators.  
 
Parent burden . We anticipate that tool completion will require [ADDRESS_1163116] through study completion. Data monitoring, including ensuring audio -
recordings are transcribed in a timely manner, will be confirmed monthly by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study coordinat or. For the audio recordings, we will use a Duke -
approved  transcription  service.  For the purposes  of our study,  “de-identification” w ill 
involve the removal of all identifiers outlined by [CONTACT_837480]. Qualitative 
software will be used to analyze de -identified transcripts.  
 
Analysis files will be permanently stored on the Duke Server. During the analysis phase, de -
identified analysis files may additionally be stored on Duke Box or  a Duke  University  or 
Duke  Health  System  computer,  and uploaded  to the Duke  server daily.  
 
Consent process.  
 
The consent  process  will be completed  by [CONTACT_62674],  clinical  research  
coordinator,  or clinical research specialist on the study team. There  is no time limit to the 
consent  discussion.  We are open  to answering  any potential  questions  that may arise 
when we present the study information to parents or clinicians.  
 
The consent  process  will occur  in the Neonatal  Intensive  Care  Unit,  the Pediatric  
Intensive  Care  Unit,  or the  Pediatric  Cardiac  Intensive  Care  Unit.  The parent/legal  
guardian  may be consented  over the phone  or by  [CONTACT_837481] e-consent.  The phone  
consent  process  will take place  in those  situations  where  attempts  to find  families  in the 
neonatal  intensive  care unit have  failed.  With the use of phone  consent  or an e-consent  
all efforts  will be made  to provide  a copy of  the consent  to parents  either  by [CONTACT_837482].  A telephone  script  will be used to  introduce  the study  and 
then the consent  form will be read to the parent  or sent via email  as an e-consent.  
 
 
 
 
To mitigate  the risk of loss of confidentiality,  all patient  and clinician  data will be fully de-
identified,  with a participant  ID number  assigned  in the place  of any identifiers.  This ID 
number  will be linked  to identifying information  only in a secure,  separate  file for the 
duration  of the study  period  and analysis,  to allow  follow -up clinical information to be 
collected as needed.  
 
Participants  can contact  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_837475].  In addition, given  that this study  has multiple  points  of contact,  participants  will have  
additional  opportunities  to raise questions throughout the study period.   
 
We will maintain  a high level  of sensitivity  to passive  refusal,  so prospective  participants  
who do not show active interest will not be enrolled in the study.  
 
Privacy and confidentiality.  
 
All patient  and physician  data will be de-identified,  with a participant  ID number  assigned  
in the place  of any  identifiers.  This ID number  will be linked  to identifying  information  only 
in a secure,  separate  file for the  duration  of the study  period  and analysis,  to allow  follow -
up clinical  information  to be collected  as needed. All recordings will be transcribed and 
de-identified.  
 
Audio -recordings,  transcriptions,  and other  data will be securely  stored  on a Duke  server  
accessible  to the research  team.  Audio  recordings  will be reviewed  by a Duke -approved  
transcription  service  to de-identify audio  recordings.  Paper  documents  will be kept in a 
locked  cabinet  in an access  controlled  area.

ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
1. BACKGROUND  
Approximately 8,500  Veterans with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke are cared for in a 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Emergency Department (ED) or inpatient ward annually.1 
Patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at very high risk of recurrent vascular events; 
over the long -term 11% per year will have a stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death.2-[ADDRESS_211673] demonstrated that interventions which 
deliver timely care reduce the risk of recurrent vascular events by 70%.5  
 
Our group has assessed the quality of care for Veterans with TIA and minor stroke cared 
nationwide and has found considerable gaps in care quality (e.g., 51% of eligible Veterans 
receive carotid imaging, 27% receive indicated antihypertensive medication intensification).[ADDRESS_211674] is to develop and 
evaluate an intervention program to improve the quality of care for Veterans with TIA and minor 
stroke.  
 
2. SPECIFIC AIMS  
Aim 1. To develop a program  to improve the care of Veterans with TIA or minor stroke that can 
be deployed nationwide . The program includes 5 components: (1) a reporting system that is 
based on validated electronic quality measures that allow staff to monitor the time -sensitive 
proce sses of care and outcomes of their Veterans with TIA; (2) clinical programs based on 
existing VHA infrastructure (e.g., a pharmacist -based TIA medication management program); 
(3) a staff education and training program; (4) protocols and templates for use b y clinicians, 
nurses and pharmacists; and (5) quality improvement support including a virtual collaborative to 
share lessons learned across sites. We will measure  users’ assessment of the PREVENT 
program in terms of usability, complexity, and relative adva ntage to deliver and improve care to 
Veterans wit h a recent TIA or minor stroke . We hypothesize that we can develop  and facilitate 
the implementation of  a program to improve guideline concordant care for Veterans with a 
recent TIA or minor stroke  that achieves a high degree of staff satisfac tion.  
 
Aim 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program for Veterans with TIA or minor 
stroke against usual care . Teams at the [ADDRESS_211675] . The primary effectiveness outcome is the 
proportion of Veterans who received all of the guideline -concordant processes of care for which 
they a re eligible referred to as the “Without -Fail” care rate.  We will compare the Without -Fail 
Page [ADDRESS_211676] -implementation phase to the baseline period.  We hypothesize that the 
Without -Fail care rate will be improved by [CONTACT_179845].  
 
Aim 3. To evaluate the implementation of the intervention program  across the 6  participating 
sites. The two primary  implementation outcomes will be  the number of implementation activities  
completed  during the one -year active implementation period and the  final level of team 
organization (defined as the Group Organization (GO Score)) for providing and improving TIA 
care at the end of the 12 -month active implementation period . A covariate will include the 
degree of participation  [Total # of calls attended/12 active implementation calls]  in the monthly 
collaborative calls  as noted in the call attendance . Implementation activities completed will be 
identified from  multiple data sources:  key updates and topi[INVESTIGATOR_179832]; monthly action plan achievements and additi onal facilitator notes;  the HUB implementation 
plan updates ; and 6 and 12 -month interviews .  We hypothesize that sites that engage in 
ongoing  [positive]  implementation strategies of  reflecting and evaluating, goal setting , and 
planning will realize  the greatest implementation success (defined across the two primary 
implementation outcomes : number of implementation activities and the Group Organization (GO 
score) ).  We also hypothesiz e that sites with greatest implementation success will achieve the 
highest Without -Fail rate.  We further plan to map implementation activities completed onto the 
key implementation strategies  (reflecting and evaluating, goal setting, and planning) stratifi ed by 
[CONTACT_179846] [positive & negative]  based upon the mixed methodology coding .  
 
Secondary Aim To evaluate the sustainability of the program.  Sustainability will be evaluated 
over a one -year period that begins after the one -year active implementation period.   We will 
compare the Without -Fail rate in the sustainability period to the post -implementation period.  Our 
hypothesis is that sites that implement a facility -wide, TIA System of Care (reflected in a final 
12-month GO score between 8-10) will demonstrate the greatest program sustainability as 
measured by [CONTACT_179847] -Fail rate . Further, sites that maintain their implementation activities  
involving PREVENT -related program elements during the sustainability period will demonstrate 
the gre atest program sustainability as measured by [CONTACT_179847] -Fail rate . 
 
3. RATIONALE  
Imperative to Provide Timely Care for Patients with TIA and Minor Stroke . Because  the risk of 
recurrent vascular events is highest early after an index cerebrovascular event,[ADDRESS_211677] 
demonstrated improved outcomes for TIA/minor stroke patients with programs that emphasize 
early evaluation and management including: lower stroke rate, reduced lengths of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
reduced costs, and improved vascular risk factor management.7-9 The EXPRESS study 
demonstrated that early assessment and management of TIA/minor stroke patients reduced the 
90-day stroke risk by  80% (from 10.3% to 2.1%).9 Similarly, the SOS -TIA study, found a 79% 
reduction in the 90 -days stroke rate (from a predicted rate of 5.96% to an observed rate of 
1.24%).[ADDRESS_211678] than usual care ; guideline 
adherence improved from 41% to 76% and the 90 -day recurrent vascular event rate decreased 
from 11.9% to 3.5%.[ADDRESS_211679] demonstrated that nurse -administered, telephone -
delivered care can improve v ascular risk factor control for Veterans.12,13  The planned 
Page 3 of 22 
 intervention similarly includes algorithms and protocols for the timely delivery of guideline 
concordant care. Finally, the processes of care that are the focus of the intervention are all 
supported by [CONTACT_34129]/ASA secondary prevention guidelines  or other relevant professional 
organization guidelines .[ADDRESS_211680] demonstrated that protocol -based care dramatically 
reduces the risk of recurrent vascular events.11,15  
 
4. METHODS  
 
4.1 Aim 1 Methods (Program Development)  
The development of the PREVENT program was based on four main components: (1) 
interviews with VHA staff members involved in the care of patients with cerebrovascular 
disease;16 (2) validation  of electronic quality measures against chart review for use in ongoing 
assessment of a broad range of processes of care at all VHA medical centers;17 (3) baseline 
quality of care data identifying potential gaps in care that should serve as targets for quality 
improvement;18 and (4) the existing literature regarding effective TIA clinical programs.  11-13,[ADDRESS_211681],16 we met with diverse  staff members involved in the care of patients 
with stroke and TIA including: stroke team members (which included  nursing, neurology, and 
ED members), pharmacy , primary care providers, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65266], radiology, vascular surgery, 
cardiology, ophthalmology, systems redesign, and quality management  staff.  Based on 
interviews with these staff, we identified barriers to providing high quality TIA care  including: 
gaps in knowledge; 
lack of performance 
data; uncertainty 
about how to 
engage in quali ty 
improvement; 
inadequate care 
coordination; and 
information 
technology 
barriers .16 The 
PREVENT 
intervention was 
designed to address 
each of these 
barriers; to utilize 
existing VHA 
resources to 
improve care for 
areas with 
demonstrated gaps 
in quality; and to 
include strategies 
which were successfully deployed in  prior TIA intervention studies.  
 
PREVENT Intervention Components Description  
The PREVENT QI program includes 5 components: (1) a reporting system that is based on 
validated electronic quality measures that allow staff to monitor the time -sensitive processes of 

Page 4 of 22 
 care and outcomes of their Veterans with TIA; (2) clinical programs base d on existing VHA 
infrastructure (e.g., a pharmacist -based TIA medication management program); (3) a staff 
training program; (4) protocols and templates for use by [CONTACT_15098], nurses and pharmacists; and 
(5) quality improvement support including a virtual collaborative to share lessons learned across 
sites.  
 
Implementation Strategies  
The PREVENT program employs three primary implementation strategies: (1) team activation 
via (a) audit and feedback, (b) reflecting and evaluating, (c) planning, and (d) go al setting; (2) 
external facilitation; and (3) building a community of practice.  In addition, PREVENT allows for 
local adaptation of the intervention and also takes advantage of peer pressure  while providing 
facilitation support to the site champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] . During the active implementation period, we are 
tracking the adopted and adapted PREVENT program elements chosen by [CONTACT_179848]. Adoption is defined as PREVENT program elements chosen to be implement ed at a 
local site. Adaptation is defined as  site specific  modification s made  to the chosen PREVENT 
program elements during implementation.  
 
Aim 1 Evaluation  
Our assessment of the program development is based on the end-user evaluation of the 
usability, and complexity of the program to deliver and to improve care to Veterans with TIA.19  
We will obtain these data during interviews conducted 6 -months after the start of active 
implementation and again at the end of active implementation.  
 
Aim 1 Assessments: staff satisfaction with the intervention  
Obtained at 6-months and 1 -year after the start of active implementation  
 
Participant perceptions and overall experience with each of the following elements of 
PREVENT as well as:  the ease of use, how useful each element is to providing or improving 
care, and whether they are using each element:  
1. PREVENT overall  
2. The five components  
3. Kick-Off 
4. Hub (overall perceptions, usabilit y, how are they using the hub)  
5. Virtual collaborative/monthly call s 
6. External facilitation  
Participant perceptions of PREVENT program complexity  and usability   
Describe any sharing of tools with peers or with leadership at own facility, with other facilities  
Which components of PREVENT are the most helpful to you as you work to improve 
outcomes for your Veteran patients with TIA/minor stroke?  
Specific quality improvement activities  planned  for next 6 months  
 
Audience -response system (ARS) feedback about program components and staff written 
evaluations obtained during the Kick -Off will also inform the assessment of staff satisfaction with 
the intervention and implementation strategies.  
 
Aim 1 Analysis  
Aim 1 Hyp othesis: that we can develop a program to improve guideline concordant care for 
Veterans with a recent TIA or minor stroke that achieves a high degree of staff satisfaction 
Page 5 of 22 
 (defined as users’ assessment of the PREVENT program in terms of usability, complex ity, and 
relative advantage to deliver and improve care to Veterans with a recent TIA or minor stroke).  
 
The assessment  of staff satisfaction with the PREVENT program and its components will utilize 
mixed methods .  We will seek to identify the components of the intervention that were 
considered to be most useful and/or most important  to the local  PREVENT program  in both the 
6-and 12 -month interviews as well as the staff program evaluations  complet ed at the end of  the 
day long site kick off .  
 
Interviews with facility stakeholders will be conducted in person during site visits or by 
[CONTACT_756] . Key stakeholders are defined as front line staff, managers,  and leadership affiliated 
with the delivery of TIA care.  We will also accept “snowball” referrals from key stakeholders.  
Upon receipt of verbal consent, a ll interviews will be audio recorded. The audio recordings will 
be transcribed verbatim.  All transcripts will be de -identified and imported into an Nvivo11 
proje ct file for data coding and analysis. Project team members will independently read and 
code identical transcripts using a  common codebook derived from the semi -structured interview 
guide  and project analysis plan . We plan to code for the presence or absenc e of constructs as 
well as the magnitude and valence each specified Consolidated Framework for Implementation 
Research  (CFIR ) constructs . Each coded transcript will be merged into a single file, and the 
project team will meet as a group to review and discu ss similarities and differences in the coding 
selections until a shared understanding of each item in the codebook had been developed. All 
codes will be defined with examples in a common codebook  and updated as needed by [CONTACT_179849].  At a minimum, two coders per interview will be assigned to each 
interview to best capture the specified constructs.  Completed coded interviews from each site 
will be merged into Facility level estates and ultimately, all Facility level estates will be merge d 
into a Project Universe file for analysis.  
 
Coding for Usability  and Complexity . We will derive the users’ assessment of the intervention 
using the Intervention Characteristics domain from the Consolidated Framework for 
Implementation Research (CFIR). We will code statements on the presence of Intervention 
specific CFIR constructs about how the PREVENT program was useful for their local adopted 
program to delivery TIA care as wel l as statements on how it was not helpful ; we will code 
statements about how complex the PREVENT program components were to implement as well 
as statements on the lack of complexity/ease of the components’ implementation  to improve the 
7-key metrics of TIA  related care.  
 
Coding for Context . We will continue to use the CFIR coding methodology to denote the 
presence or absence of the local context including the following from the inner setting: structural 
characteristics, networks and communications, culture, learning climate, leadership 
engagement, and available resources as well as champi[INVESTIGATOR_179833].  
 
Key Implementation Strategies and CFIR constructs . We will expand the CFIR coding to include 
valence (positive + and negative -) influences on implementation for our key implementation 
strategies: reflecting and evaluation; goal setting and feedback; planning ; and champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] . 
 
 
4.2 Aim 2 Methods (Effectiveness)  
 
Design  
This five -year stepped -wedge20,[ADDRESS_211682] involves three 
Page 6 of 22 
 phases at each of the six sites: a one year -baseline phase, a one -year active implementation 
phase, and a sustainability phase of at least one year  in duration follows the end of active 
implementation.  
 
 
 
Power and Sample Size  
The six site, stepped wedge design provides >90% power to detect an improvement in the 
mean facility Without -Fail rate from 25% during the baseline data period to >50% during the 
active implementation data period. The goal for the sample size was to recrui t sites with at least 
[ADDRESS_211683] 𝐻0: 𝜃=0,𝐻1:𝜃=𝜃𝑀 for the intervention effect size 𝜃𝑀 ranging 
from 0.[ADDRESS_211684] over time 𝛾. 
The plot was based on a total of 6 clusters with a cluster sample size of 30, 50 and 70, 
respective ly. The results demonstrated that this variant of SWD generally has a reasonable 
power (greater than or equal to 0.90) for detecting the intervention effect when the effect size is 
at least 0.15 with a cluster size no less than 30. The coefficient of varia tion (CV) was set at 0.2, 
0.4, 0.6, and 0.[ADDRESS_211685] on power.

Site Selection  
Sites were invited to participate on the basis the basis of demonstrated gaps in quality of care 
(identified using the validated eQMs). Specifically, sites were invited to participate if they had 
baseline without -fail rates of <50%.  Invitations were sent via email to higher volume sites first 
and recruitment continued until 6 participating sites were identified.  No minimum threshold on 
volume was employed because our goal was to include sites which were diverse so that the 
results might be widely generali zable across the full spectrum of VHA facilities.  
 
 
Allocation of Sites to Waves  
Although some stepped -wedge trials randomly assign facilities to waves, PREVENT sites were 
allocated to waves on the basis of the pragmatics of the ability to schedule baseline and Kick -
Off meetings.   
 
Intervention Implementation  
The multi -faceted PREVENT  intervention (described above) will be implemented via a Kick -Off 
meeting which includes all relevant staff members at participating sites and then through 
monthly telephone conference calls which include all members of the teams at the participating 
sites after the Kick -Off. Participants in the collaborative calls receive CME (Continuing Medical 

Page 8 of 22 
 Education) for clinicians and pharmacists or CEU (Continuing Education Units) for nurses.   All 
data, quality improvement plans, professional education materials a nd other resources will be 
shared with the sites through the web -based portal, referred to as the PREVENT hub.   
 
Focus on Staff/Facilities  
The intervention targets participating site staff members.  Individual patients are not the target of 
the intervent ion or the  implementatio n activities.  
 
Effectiveness Outcome: The Without -Fail Rate  
The primary effectivene ss outcome, referred to as the Without -Fail care rate, is the proportion of 
Veterans who received all of the care for which they are eligible from among 7 key processes of 
care: brain imaging, carotid artery imaging, neurology consultation, hypertension control, 
anticoagulation for atrial fibril lation, antithrombotics, and high/moderate potency statins.  The 
Without -Fail rate is calculated at the facility level based on electronic health record data using 
validated algorithms.17  Data from all TIA patients cared for in the participating facilities’ 
Emergency Departments  (ED) or inpatient settings are included in the measurement of the 
without -fail rate.

Primary Aim 2 Analysis:  
Descriptive Analysis : The Without -Fail care rate will be estimated at each site for each of the 
three periods ( baseline, post-implementation, and sustainability)  to exam the temporal trends in 
the intervention effectiveness . The 95% confidence intervals for the rates will be  provided .  
 
Statistical Models : Due to the variation of sample size across the sites and across the 
implementation phases, generalized mixed -effects models (GLMM) at patient level with 
multilevel hierarchical random effects will be developed to analyze the intervention effects on 
the W ithout -Fail care rate during the post-implementation period  and sustainability  period  
compared with  the baseline period.         
Page 9 of 22 
  
The baseline data period is the one -year prior to the date of the baseline site visit.  The active 
implementation  phase  data pe riod extends for one year from month 2 -13 after the Kick -Off 
event.  For the primary effectiveness analysis, the main c omparison is the mean facility Without -
Fail rate across the six sites during the baseline data (control) period (blue shading above) 
versus the mean facility Without -Fail rate across the six sites during the post-implementation 
data period  including the active implementation and one year after the active implementation 
phases (green  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_179834] s above) .  We propose to model the “Wi thout -Fail” care rate by  
 
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑃(𝑌𝑖𝑗,𝑘=1|𝑋𝑖𝑗,𝑘,𝑍𝑖𝑗,𝑘,𝑊𝑖𝑗,𝑘)
1−𝑃(𝑌𝑖𝑗,𝑘=1|𝑋𝑖𝑗,𝑘,𝑍𝑖𝑗,𝑘,𝑊𝑖𝑗,𝑘)=µ+𝛼𝑖+𝛽𝑗+𝑋𝑖𝑗,𝑘𝜃+𝑍𝑖𝑗,𝑘𝛾+𝑊𝑖𝑗,𝑘𝑡𝜏 
 
where  𝑖 indexes the site ( 𝑖=1,2,3,4,5,6); 𝑗  the implementation phase (1: baseli ne period; 2: 
active implementation phase; 3: one year after the active implementation phase); 𝑘 the 
encounter at the 𝑖𝑡ℎsite and the 𝑗𝑡ℎphase ( 𝑘=1,2,…,𝑛𝑖𝑗); 𝑛𝑖𝑗is the total number of encounters 
at the 𝑖𝑡ℎsite and the 𝑗𝑡ℎphase; 𝑋𝑖𝑗,𝑘and  𝑍𝑖𝑗,𝑘 the indicators of the active implementation phase  
and one year after the active implementation phase, respectively; 𝑊𝑖𝑗,𝑘the vector of the 𝑘𝑡ℎ 
encounter’s characteristics at the 𝑖𝑡ℎsite and the 𝑗𝑡ℎphase that could include the  site 
characteristics; 𝑌𝑖𝑗,𝑘=1the indicator  of observation of “Without -Fail” care process on the 𝑘𝑡ℎ 
encounter at the 𝑖𝑡ℎsite and the 𝑗𝑡ℎphase. For this model, µ represents the average log odds of 
Without -Fail care across the 6 sites at baseline;  θ the log odds ratio between the active 
implementation phase and the baseline indicating the intervention effect during  the active 
implementation phase; and  𝛾 the log odds ratio between one year after the active 
implementation phase and the baseline indi cating the intervention sustainability effect post the 
implementation; 𝛼𝑖 and 𝛽𝑗 are the site and phase specific random effects that are assumed to be 
multivariate normal. After fitting the model, the normal theory can be applied to test the 
interventi on effect at the active implementation phase and the intervention sustainability effect.    
 
Secondary Aim 2 Analyses: Several secondary effectiveness analyses are planned.  
 
Comparison to Matched Controls  
Six control sites will be  matched to each of the six PREVENT active implementation sites on the 
basis of : TIA patient volume, facility complexity (i.e., teaching status, intensive care unit level), 
and quality of care (measured by [CONTACT_179850] -fail rate). The total number of contro l sites will be  
36. The definition of the baseline period (the specific start and end dates of the one -year 
baseline period) for each matched control site will be  identical to the definition used for the 
PREVENT active site to which the controls are matche d. We will compare changes in quality 
and outcomes at control sites to changes at PREVENT sites as a method for assessing 
temporal trends.  
 
Changes in Individual Processes of Care  
An examination of the care rate of facility process for each of the seven primary processes of 
care across the six sites from the baseline  perio d to post-implementation period  will be 
conducted using the same analytical template as outlined for the primary analysis . A single risk 
adjustment model will be de veloped for use in evaluating the seven processes of care and will 
focus on baseline patient characteristics as follows:

90-Day Recurrent Stroke Rate  
(1) The 90 -Day recurrent stroke rate will be estimated at each site before (baseline and pre -
implementation phase) and after (active implementation phase and one year after the active 
implementation phase) the intervention to exam ine the temporal trends in intervention 
effectiveness  for reducing the 90-day recurrent stroke rate . The 95% confidence intervals for the 
rates will be provided.  
 
(2) The similar GLMM at patien t level as described for the primary analysis will be developed for 
the incidence of 90 -day recurrent strok e across the six sites and the whole study period to study 
the mean change of this rate. Fo r this model, the indicator of Without Fail care at the encounter 
level will be incorporated into the model as the main exploratory variable to exa mine if the 
improvement of the Without Fail  care rate will result in significant reduction of the 90 -Day 
recurrent stroke rate.     
 
90-Day Mortality  
The analysis plan  for the 90 -day recurrent stroke rate (described above) will also be 
implemented for the [ADDRESS_211686]-implementation  periods  using the same approach  described above for the Without -
Fail rate analysis.  
 
 
Secondary Processes of Care    
An examination of the secondary processes of care: baseline versus active implementation data 
periods.  
 
Sensitivity Analyses  
The primary analysis will include the first TI A event per patient during the entire study period.  In 
sensitivity analysis, we will include (1) the first event per period and (2) all TIA events in the 
analysis . 
 
4.3 Aim 3 Methods (Implementation)  
Implementation is being guided by [CONTACT_179851] 
(CFIR), which serves as the project’s conceptual framework.  We will use a mixed methods 
approach to evaluate implementation .  Based on data from sites visits , observa tions made 
during Kick -Offs and collaborative telephone calls , and interviews at 6 -months and 12 -months 
after active implementation , we will assess : the number of improvement initiatives completed; 
the level of team organization for providing and improving  TIA care; the degree to which sites 
engage in ongoing reflecting and evaluating, goal setting, and planning ; participation in t he 
monthly collaborative calls; the local adoption and adaptability of the program  over the course of 
the study; and contextual factors to identify optimal context associated with implementation 
success. The two primary implementation outcomes will be the number of implementation 
activities  completed and the level of team organization  [GO Score]  for providing and improving 
TIA care.

GO Score – Group Organization Score22 for Providing and Improving TIA Care is a measure of 
team activation on a [ADDRESS_211688] – Fast Analysis & Synthesis Template. This template serves as a rapid, systematic  
method for extracting key concepts across data sources and is derived from A. Hamilton 
methodology23 and used most recently to summarize qualitative findings across regions (HSRD 
Summer 2017 featured presentation). In a similar manner, we will utilize the FAST template to 
capture key concepts from the Collaborative Calls, St akeholder interviews, and other data 
sources  in a condensed manner that accords with interview guides .

CFIR . From the 5 CFIR Domains, w e are interested in the local implementation of the novel 
Intervention domain within the Inner Setting, i.e., each of the VAMCs. Within the Implementation 
Processes domain, we are interested in the clinical provider self -efficacy (Individual Domain) to 
implement PREVENT and to perform the 7 clinical processes upon which the without fail rate is 
calculated , and the organization’s  cosmopolitanism (External Setting), the degree to which an 
organization is networked with other external organizations. The table below offers examples of 
how the CFIR construct for “Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]” has been coded, rated, and scored.

Categorical data captured by [CONTACT_179853] -level data (e.g., job 
position, primary clinical area, etc.) for each of the interviews. We will use NVivo1 [ADDRESS_211691] data, the standardized survey data (e.g., OCAI 
measure), the categorical data, and the quantitative outcome data in a single, unified project file 
with multiple codebooks (qualitative, scored constructs, quantitative, categorical). We will use 
the NVivo1 1 “matrix query” feature to explore relationships between the qualitative, construct, 
quantitative and categorical data, and through this direct cross -referencing of qualitative and 
Page [ADDRESS_211692] outcomes .  
 
Aim 3 Hypothesis A: that sites that engage in ongoing reflecting and evaluating, goal setting, 
and planning will realize the greatest implementation success (based on the number of 
implementation activities  completed and the le vel of team organization for providing and 
improving TIA care  at 12 months ).   
 
As described above, t he degree to which sites engage in reflecting and evaluating, goal setting, 
and planning will be assessed using an approach to qualitative coding of CFIR constructs that 
assigns valence and in this way each site will be assigned a designation that varies f rom -2 to 
+2 for the four constructs ((a) reflecting and evaluating, (b) goal setting, (c) planning , and (d) 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] ).  The level of team organization is based on the GO score which varies from 1 
(least complex level of organization) to 10 (most complex level of organization).

implementation success will be included in the GLMM model described above as cluster -level 
(aka fa cility-level) covariates. Specifically, the change in GO score from baseline to post -
implementation as well as the number of implementation activities  during the active 
implementation phase will be included in the model  along with the covariate of the numb er of 
collaborative calls attended .

Identification of Effective Implementation Strategies  
As described above, PREVENT employs three primary implementation strategies: (1) team 
activation via (a) audit and feedback, (b) reflecting and evaluating, (c) planning, and (d) goal 
setting; (2) external facilitation; and (3) building a community of pract ice.  In addition, PREVENT 
allows for local adaptation of the intervention and also takes advantage of peer pressure.  
The identification of successful implementation strategies will be based on a mixed methods 
assessment where the change in the Without -Fail rate will be used to define implementation 
success.  As shown in Table 3C, we will compare facilities based upon a High Final Without Fail 
rate as defined as 50% or higher compared to those defined as low final rate (less than 50%) by 
[CONTACT_179854] e of engagement in implementation strategies  and dose received as well as strength 
of clinical champi[INVESTIGATOR_179842].  Similarly, we will compare the rate of change [% 
of change] from baseline to end of active implementation.  
 
 
External Facili tation  
We will describe the dose, type, and temporal trends in external facilitation that is provided to 
each of the sites over the course of the one -year active implementation period.  We will also ask 
participants to describe their experience with and th eir assessment of the external facilitation 
that was provided by [CONTACT_179855] [ADDRESS_211693] -implementation.  
 
Community of Practice: Collaborative Call Assessment  
Given that a key component of the implemen tation plan was the development of a virtual 
collaborative via monthly conference calls, we are particularly interested in the perceived value 
of the collaborative calls.  
 
As part of the interviews at [ADDRESS_211694] -implementation we will code the 
interviews to elicit the following emerging topi[INVESTIGATOR_179843]:  
• Did the calls increase your utilization of the h ub? 
• Did the calls create a sense of profession community?  
Page 18 of 22 
 • Did the calls serve to maintain your interest and enthusiasm about TIA quality 
improvement?  
• What was the single most important element of PREVENT participation for you working 
in your facility: kick off, monthly process data on the hub, having access to the PREVENT 
community, the monthly calls, the library of resources and materials on the hub?  
 
As part of the secondary implementation analysis we will examine whether participation in the 
calls (number  of participants per site per call and presenting on the calls) relate to the Go Score. 
We will also examine whether hub usage (by [CONTACT_568]) increased just prior to or immediately 
following the calls.  Similarly, we will examine whether email contact [CONTACT_179856] a collaborative call.  Finally, we will describe the 
“eureka moments” that occurred during or as a result of the calls.  
 
Use of the HUB  
Qualitative interview data from [ADDRESS_211695] 
commonly visited.  Moreover , we will interview key users from each site with in depth usability 
questions.  
 
4.4 Secondary Aim Methods (Sustainability ) 
The sustainability analysis will include: a c omparison of the change in the Without -Rail rate  from 
the baseline data period to the sustainability period (blue versus pi[INVESTIGATOR_179844]).  We will 
build multilevel models as described above for the Aim [ADDRESS_211696] use of their own quality data (e.g., did they 
generate their own data, the frequency w ith which they reviewed the process of care data on the 
hub, whether they incorporated proces s of care  data into routine work flow, did they conduct 
their own chart reviews) demonstrate the greatest program sustainability.   Again, these cluster -
level characteristics will be included in the GLMM model described above.  
 
4.5 Risk Score  
As part of the PREVENT program, participating sites are provided with their patient risk score 
which is a measure of the risk of 1 -year mortality.  We are interested in two analyses related to 
the risk score.  
 
1. How did the sites use the patient risk score?   This assessment will be based on 
qualitative interviews with sites at [ADDRESS_211697] -implementation.  
 
2. Risk score validation .  For this analysis, all VAMCs will be included (not only PREVENT  
sites).  Predicted risk scores, with their 95% confide nce intervals, will be compared with 
observed 1 -year mortality  and its 95% confidence interval .

Exparel RCT TSA Protocol 24MAR2020   Page [ADDRESS_131265] -operative Pain Control after Total Shoulder 
Arthroplasty  
 
INTRODUCTION  
Routine anesthetic care for patients undergoing a Total Shoulder Arthroplasty  (TSA)  at our institution 
includes the implantation of a pain pump.  A pain pump is used to allow pain control in the days after a 
TSA. Anec dotally patients complain of breakthrough pain the night after their surgery when the local 
anesthetic administered during  surgery starts wearing off  [Abdallah] .  
 
Exparel ( Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_117610] e liposom e injectable suspensi on), a sustained -release preparation of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_117611] , may provide a lower -cost alternative to a 
pain pump , as it has the potential for activity up to 72 hours after surgery [ Davidovitch, Golf, Haas ]. Two 
prior randomized clinical controlled trials have compared Ex parel to an intraoperative int erscalene bloc k 
and showed improved pain scores and less opi[INVESTIGATOR_117612] [ADDRESS_131266] 
been no studies comparing Exparel to a pain pump and evaluated the outcomes  beyond 24 hours after 
surgery.  
 
The primary objective of this study is to determine if Exparel leads to better pain scores at 24, 48  and 73 
hours after TSA compared to a pain pump.  Secondary objectives are (1)  to determine if patients on 
Exparel use less narcotics and (2) have earlier return of functional use of the involved arm after surgery 
compared to the pain pump .  
 
METHODS  
Sample size:  
Based on prior studies on anesthetics for TSA, the mean worst pain score in the [ADDRESS_131267] a change of 2 points, alpha of 0.05, beta of 0.80, a sample 
size of 51 subjects in each group will be required.  To account for drop -outs, a total of 60 subjects in 
each arm will be enrolled.  
 
Inclusion criteria

 Indication for surgery is osteoarthritis , rotator cuff arthropathy or massive ir reparable 
rotator cuff tears

 Anesthesia administered by  [CONTACT_15957]-Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_117615])  
 Willing and able to sign an Informed Consent  
Exclusion  criteria

 Comorbid psychiatric diagnosis requiring therapy and/or medication  except anxiety or 
depression

Exparel RCT TSA Protocol 24MAR2020   Page 2 of 3 
   On long -acting narcotic pain medication  (including extended release narcotic pain 
medications and methadone)  
 Home Oxygen requirement whether PRN or scheduled.  
 Contralateral Phrenic Nerve paralysis / incompetence.  
 BMI ≥ 50  
  
Randomization will be a varied blocked randomization with blocks of 12, 15 and 18 using sealed 
envelopes  
 
Treatment arms:  
Control:  Pain catheter based pain control.   Subject will receive an interscalene block with Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_9360] 
0.5% (20cc), and th en a pain pump attached in the PACU infusing at 4cc/hr.   The patient will go home 
with that device until it runs out.  
Interventional:  Single shot Exparel 10cc (133mg) mixed with 10cc of 0.5% Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_117613].  Celebrex 400mg PO, 
Gabapentin 600mg PO, Tylenol 1 gram PO, unless contraindicated.

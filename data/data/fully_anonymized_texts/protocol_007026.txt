    1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background and Rationale  
Defibrotide ( Defitelio®) is proposed to be indicated for the prevention of acute graft -versus-host 
disease (a GvHD) in adult and pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) and at high risk of aGvHD. Defibrotide is a highly complex polydisperse collection of 
predominantly single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides prepared by [CONTACT_684627]. While the mechanism of a ction of 
defibrotide has not been fully elucidated, nonclinical and clinical data have shown that defibrotide protects endothelial cells (EC s) and has the potential to modulate early alloreactivity 
and subsequent end organ damage post-HSCT. Defibrotide is postulated to reduce the incidence of aGvHD without an increase in opportunistic infections or disease relapse by: 1) potentially ameliorating the onset and propagation of the alloreactivity seen immediately after conditioning and HSCT, 2) protecting ECs in GvHD target organs from donor alloreactive T- cell infiltration 
and damage, and 3) not directly depleting T-cells involved in the graft -versus-tumor (GvT) 
effect. Defibrotide (defibrotide sodium; brand name [CONTACT_684680]) has been approved in the United 
States (US) and Canada for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with hepatic veno-
occlusive disease ( VOD), also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), with evidence 
of renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT. Defibrotide is also currently marketed in Europe, Israel, and South Korea with the brand name [CONTACT_684681]-HSCT therapy.  
Graft-versus-host disease is a life -threatening complication following allogeneic HSCT. Graft-
versus-host disease occurs when immune cells transplanted from a non- identical donor (the graft) 
recognize the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (the host) as foreign, thereby [CONTACT_684628]. Allogeneic transplant patients receiving the most cytotoxic conditioning regimens (myeloablative conditioning [MAC]) and stem cell grafts from donors most genetically unlike themselves (unrelated donors and/or patient-donor pairs who are mismatched at genetic loci, ie, human leukocyte antigen [HLA] mismatched) have the highest risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_43508]. Acute GvHD usually occurs within the first [ADDRESS_927473]; involves potentially severe damage to the skin, liver, and/or gastrointestinal tract; increases the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_684574] (cGvHD); and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. As the leading cause of transplant- related morbidity and non- relapse 
mortality, GvHD limits the potential curative effect of HSCT on many hematologic malignancies. One in every 5 patients receiving a transplant from an unrelated donor dies from 
GvHD, and overall up to 1 in 10 transplant patients dies from GvHD complications ( Pasquini 
and Zhu 2015).  
Acute GvHD is recognized to be a consequence of donor T- cell activation and proliferation 
following recognition of host alloantigens, and multiple physiological events prior to and after 
HSCT contribute to local inflammation and target tissue destruction ( Nomura et al 2017). The 
first step in the pathophysiology of aGvHD is postulated to be EC  damage, which can be caused

Defibrotide (JZP -963)  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  
Clinical Trial Protocol: JZP963- [ADDRESS_927474], and subsequent donor cell engraftment ( Palomo et al 2010). The damage is subsequently coupled with processes 
that amplify the original insult and promote further endothelial and tissue dysfunction. For example, conditioning regimen toxicity causes endothelial apoptosis and release of polynucleotides from dying cells (ie, damage- associated molecular patterns ), activation of 
antigen-presenting cells, with release of proinflam matory cytokines, resulting in increased 
expression of adhesion molecule receptors at the EC  surface (Mir et al 2017 ), while translocation 
of bacterial endotoxin may enhance these effects and increase antigenicity of ECs toward 
allogeneic CD8+ cytotoxic T -lymphocytes ( Eissner et al 2002).  
The potential for allogeneic HSCT to be curative depends on the complete destruction of malignant cells by 2 processes: the direct cytotoxic effects of pre -transplant conditioning; and the 
immunologically -mediated cytotoxi c effects of the stem cell graft (GvT effect) . This 
immunologically -mediated GvT effect (alloreactivity) is also the underlying basis of GvHD, 
when donor T- cells are stimulated to initiate variable degrees of acute and/or chronic host tissue 
inflammation, leading to aGvHD or cGvHD. Overall survival is dependent on the relative 
difference between the severity of aGvHD (which increases mortality mainly by [CONTACT_684629]) and the magnitude of the GvT effect (which decreases mortality by [CONTACT_684630]). Successful prevention of Grade B-D aGvHD, while preserving the GvT effect, would likely decrease morbidity and mortality by [CONTACT_684631], decreasing the symptoms of moderate and severe aGvHD, and maintaining the graft’s positive effect on residual malignant cells after pre -transplant conditioning (decreased risk of relapse). 
Most prophylactic treatments in use remain investigational in aGvHD, and progress in developi[INVESTIGATOR_684575]. The backbone of most T- cell replete conventional 
aGvHD prophylaxis regimens includes: 1) methotrexate (MTX) or mycophenylate mofetil (MMF) plus  2) a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine A [CSA] or tacrolimus [TAC]). Of these, 
MMF is used more frequently in non-MAC and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens and umbilical cord blood transplants ( Holtan et al 2014). Sirolimus is sometimes substituted for 
MTX, but VOD is a con cern when used in combination with TAC, especially in busulfan-
containing regimens. Steroids are typi[INVESTIGATOR_684576] a lack of proven benefit (Holtan et al 2014). Anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG) has been shown to reduce the 
incidence of cGvHD and aGvHD ( Finke et al 2009 , Kroger et al 2016 ). However its adoption is 
not universal , and recent data showed that ATG is associated with increased disease relapse, 
reactivation of Epstein -Barr virus, delayed engraftment, and reduced overall surviva l (Walker et  
al 2016, Soiffer et al 2016 ). In summation, current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_684577], which highlight the profound limitations in treatments to prevent this life- threatening 
disease.

Defibrotide (JZP -963)  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  
Clinical Trial Protocol: JZP963- [ADDRESS_927475]. Approximately 40-59% of adult and pediatric 
patients receiving allogeneic transplants from unrelated donors develop clinic ally significant 
Grade B-D aGvHD (Jagasia et al 2012, Jacobsohn 2008). First -line therapy consists of 
intravenous (IV) steroids, but nearly 40% of all patients with Grade B-D aGvHD are refractory to steroid-based therapy and further treatment options are limited. Second- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_70047], high failure rates, and patients with steroid refractory GvHD have 1 -year overall survival rates of approximately 20- 30% (Pavletic and Fowler 2012). 
In addition, approximately 8- 30% of patients with unrelated donors will develop severe 
(Grade C-D) aGvHD (Jagasia et al 2012 , Jacobsohn 2008), with estimated 5 -year survival rates 
of 25% (Grade C ) and 5% (Grade D) (Cahn et al 2005).  
Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a GvHD exhibit a n enhanced degree of  EC dysfunction compared with 
patients who do not develop this complication ( Mir et al 2017). In patients with aGvHD, there is 
an increase in the biomarkers associated with EC damage (endothelial microparticles, E -selection 
and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ ICAM-1], von Willebrand factor; Palomo et al 2010, 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_684578] 2006, Matsuda et al 2001, Biedermann et al 2003). Furthermore, factors in serum from patients with aGvHD promote EC  activation ( Mir et al 2017) and there is an association 
between Grade C-D GvHD and increased angiopoietin- 2 levels at baseline that suggests a 
connection to early damage to the endothelium ( Dietrich et al 2013 ). Finally, circulating ECs in 
peripheral blood increase from engraftment to onset of GvHD ( Almici et al 2014 ). 
Ultimately, the goal of aGvHD prevention is to minimize the graft’s negative effects on the patient while preserving its positive effects on both the underlying disease (GvT) and immune reconstitution. Current standard of care can limit the beneficial GvT effect and increase the risk of opportunistic infection and disease relapse. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated 
with GvHD and the limitations of current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], prevention of aGvHD remains an area with significant unmet need.  
1.2. Nonclinical Experience 
Nonclinical and clinical data suggest that the protective effect of defibrotide may be mediated 
via fibrinolytic, antithrombotic, anti- ischemic, anti -inflammatory, and anti- adhesive actions  
(reviewed in Pescador et al 2013 ). The mechanism of act ion of defibrotide is as a multi-t arget 
compound (Pescador et al 2013, Benimetskaya et al 2008 , Echart et al 2009 , Cella et al 2001 , 
Coccheri et al 1988 , Falanga et al  2003). Nonclinical studies have shown that defibrotide 
increases tissue plasminogen activator (t- PA) and decreases plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 . In 
vitro studies showed that incubation of defibrotide with ECs  upregulated thrombomodulin 
mRNA levels ( Zhao et al 1994). In addition, defibrotide has been reported to induce the release 
of tissue factor pathway inhibitor from ECs and inhibit platelet aggregation by [CONTACT_684632] E2. Other experimental studies have shown that defibrotide can contribute to maintaining vascular integrity and reducing vascular permeability and inflammation. It has been shown to modulate the production of some 
inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 6 , vascular endothelial growth factor, thromboxane

    A2, leukotriene B4, and tumor necrosis factor . Defibrotide has been shown to down- regulate the 
gene expression, protein level, and activity of several inflammation- related biomarkers, 
including heparanase, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in activated ECs , reduce P -
selectin and ICAM-1.  
Defibrotide was shown to localize at the EC membranes and was subsequently internalized 
through micropi[INVESTIGATOR_103009]. However, defibrotide did not reach the cell nucleus even after 
24 hours. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of defibroti de seem to be caused by 
[CONTACT_684633] ( Palomo et al 2016).  These data suggest that 
the action of defibrotide is exerted through its interaction with the cell membrane, rather than acting through specific changes in expression of selected genes. Therefore, protection of the endothelium may prevent the development of vascular complications associated with GvHD that are caused by [CONTACT_684634]. 
The pharmacological activity of de fibrotide in aGvHD in a mouse model of allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation is underway at Duke University in the laboratory of Nelson Chao. In this model, 
BALB/c mice are lethally irradiated (8.5 Gy) and transplanted with 1×10
7 T-cell depleted bone 
marrow (BM) cells together with 1×106 T-cells from C57BL/6 mice  (Chen et al 2007). At the 
highest dose tested (800 mg/kg twice daily by [CONTACT_557426]), defibrotide showed significant benefit in clinical aGvHD scores in mice and increas ed overall survival during a 
30-day treatment period. Work is ongoing to elucidate relationships between dose schedules and benefit. 
The nonclinical safety profile of defibrotide has been characterized in a comprehensive program in compliance with the ICH S6 (R1). The safety assessment program completed for defibrotide comprised the following: repeat-dose general toxicology (rat, rabbit, and dog), in vitro and in vivo mouse and rat genotoxicity, mouse and rat oral carcinogenicity, rat and rabbit developmental and reproductive toxicology, and allergenicity, antigenicity, and immunogenicity assessments. Segment II reproductive development studies were not warranted since the conditioning regimen precludes pregnancy, and long-term toxicology studies were not warranted given the duration of dosing (median 21 days).  
Safety pharmacology evaluations were included in the repeat -dose toxicity studies in rat and 
dog to fulfill the regulatory requirement for central nervous system and cardiovascular 
evaluations. Local tolerance was r eported as part of the general toxicology studies. In the 
13-week dog toxicology study, defibrotide was well-tolerated, and the no observed effect level was 60 mg/kg/day in males and less than 60 mg/kg/day in females. Spleen, liver, and kidneys were consid ered the target organs with evidence of defibrotide uptake by [CONTACT_684635]. Toxicokinetic studies showed that the systemic exposure in dogs after infusion was generally dose dependent, tended to plateau at about 1 hour after the sta rt of 
infusion, and showed no accumulation over the study duration, which was consistent with a short half-life of approximately 11 minutes. Defibrotide administration did not demonstrate genotoxic 
potential or carcinogenic (oral) potential. No developmental or reproductive toxicity was observed after IV or IM bolus administration in rats; however, the dose levels were considered

    low relative to the human equivalent. Defibrotide repeat-dose administration did not appear to 
cause immunogenicity, allergenicity, and immunotoxicity. 
1.3. Overview of Defibrotide Clinical Development  
The clinical program for defibrotide spans more than 20 years, with clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of defibrotide for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with hepatic VOD (beginning in April 2000) and for the prevention of he patic VOD in high -risk pediatric 
patients (starting in January 2006). Additional clinical pharmacology studies have evaluated defibrotide in healthy and renally impaired subjects and have evaluated the effect of defibrotide on QTc intervals. Data on the ef fects of defibrotide in the prevention of aGvHD were generated 
as a pre-specified endpoint in a Phase 3 randomized study (Study 2004) as part of the overall 
clinical program. An ongoing Phase 3 randomized study (Study 15-007) is evaluating the efficacy and  safety of defibrotide in the prevention of VOD in adult and pediatric patients 
undergoing HSCT. For additional information on studies in the defibrotide clinical development program, refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for defibrotide. 
1.4. Clinical Expe rience 
The clinical evidence supporting defibrotide for the prevention of aGvHD comes mainly from 
the Phase [ADDRESS_927476]  
and were at high risk of hepatic VOD. Among the 356 patients in the intent- to-treat (ITT) 
population, 180 patients received defibrotide prophylaxis and 176 were in the control arm. The mean age (± standard deviation [ SD]) was 6.12±5.11 years and 6.28±5.32 years in the defibrotide 
and control arms respectively, with 26% and 25% being <2 years; and  61% and 57%, 
respectively, were males. The incidence and severity of aGvHD was a pre-specified endpoint in Study 2004 and was analysed in 241 allogeneic patients: 124 patients received defibrotide prophylaxis and 117 were in the control arm. Demographic a nd baseline characteristics were 
similar in the defibrotide and control arms of the allogeneic subset. Busulfan was used in conditioning in 62% and 64% of patients in the 2 arms, and melphalan in 60% and 53%, respectively. Grafts were from related donors in 40% and 30% of the defibrotide and control 
arms, respectively . Standard GvHD prophylaxis was allowed according to best practice and was 
generally comparable ( CSA: 80% vs 89%, MTX: 45% vs 56%, in defibrotide and control arms, 
respectively). However, there was a difference in patients who received ATG in the defibrotide 
arm compared to controls (54% vs 70% , respectively ). By [CONTACT_2006] +100, the incidence of aGvHD 
was 47% in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm compared with 67% in the control arm. The Grade B-D aGvHD by [CONTACT_2006] +100 equaled  22% in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm vs 37% in the 
control arm (p= 0.015).

Defibrotide (JZP -963)  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  
Clinical Trial Protocol: JZP963- [ADDRESS_927477] were retrospectively evaluated in 3 groups to ascertain any differences in the incidence of 
aGvHD: no defibrotide, defibrotide post-HSCT for 14 days (Day +1 to Day +14), and defibrot ide 
pre-HSCT (beginning on the first day of conditioning) for 14 days. The defibrotide groups 
received defibrotide 10  mg/kg/day for 14 days in addition to low- molecular weight heparin 
(enoxaparin, 0.4 mg), ursodeoxycholic acid (URSO), and N- acetylcystine ( NAC), while the 
control group received the same prophylaxis treatments less defibrotide. High risk criteria for VOD were similar to those for Study 2004. The GvHD prophylaxis w as per institutional 
guidelines, and included MTX/CSA, ATG- Fresenius (ATG -F), and post-transplant 
cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Of these, 85% of patients had a matched related donor (MRD) graft. 
All other patients were grouped as “Other” and included matched unrelated donors (MUD s), 
mismatched related/unrelated  donors (MMRD s, MMURDs), and haploidentical donors. 
Treatment arms were comparable according to age, conditioning intensity, use of total-body irradiation (TBI) -based preparative regimen, female donor/male recipi[INVESTIGATOR_684579], 
cytomegalovirus ( CMV) seropositivity of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and donor age. There was a trend in favo r 
of defibrotide in decreasing cumulative incidence of severe forms (Grades C-D) of aGvHD at 
Day +180 (all grades aGvHD, 25.5% vs 40% vs 46.5%, defibrotide/pre- HSCT vs 
defibrotide/post- HSCT vs co ntrol, p=0.057). No defibrotide/pre-HSCT patient developed 
Grade C-D GvHD in the pre-HSCT group vs 15.5% in the control and 11.2% in the defibrotide/post-HSCT group. This trend was seen despi[INVESTIGATOR_684580]/ pre-
HSCT group having more “Other” donors than MRDs and more peripheral blood stem cell 
(PBSC) grafts than BM grafts (diffe rence among no defibrotide vs defibrotide/post- HSCT vs 
defibrotide /pre-HSCT, p<0.001 and p=0.018, respectively), both of which are considered risk 
factors for aGvHD and would be expected to decrease the ability to show a treatment effect with defibrotide. 
Chalandon and colleagues (2016)  retrospectively analysed data from 248 patients who received 
defibrotide intravenously (800-2400 mg/day) in combination with heparin for VOD prophylaxis 
compared to patients not treated with defibrotide as controls. The Day +100 cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD was not significantly different between the 2 groups: 27% (95% 
confidence interval [CI]  22% to 33%) in the defibrotide group vs 29% ( 95% CI 24% to 35%) in 
the control group (p=0.707). T he 1-year Grade B-D aGvHD cumulative incidence was 
significantly reduced in t he defibrotide group (31%  [95% CI 25% to 37%]) compared with the 
control group (42% [95% CI 36% to 48%]) (p=0.026). Multivariate analysis, performed taking 
into account clinical factors known to influence the risk of SOS, confirmed the favorable impact of defibrotide on 100 day VOD cumulative incidence [HR 7.5x10
-7 (95%CI 1.8x10-7-3.2x10-6), 
p<0.[ZIP_CODE]]; c onversely, multivariate analysis failed to confirm the imp act of defibrotide on 
1 year event -free survival or the cumulative incidence of acute GvHD.

    Strouse and colleagues ( 2016) reviewed Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Research (CIBMTR) data for [ADDRESS_927478] between 2008-2011 for cases of 
VOD. Patients identified with severe VOD (VOD occurring in the setting of renal impairment 
requiring dialysis or any non-infectious pulmonary abnormality) were divided into 2 groups for 
analysis: those treated with defibrotide (n=41), and those not treated with defibrotide (n=55). The cumulative incidence of G rade B-D aGvHD at Day  +[ADDRESS_927479] was 23.1% (95% CI  11.4% 
to 37.4%) vs 37.7% (95% CI  25.3% to 51.0%) (defibrotide vs control, difference of -14.6% 
[95% CI -33.1% to 3.9%]). T he cumulative incidence of G rade C-D aGvHD at Day  +[ADDRESS_927480] was 10 .9% (95% CI 3.0% to 22.8%) vs 28.6% (95% CI  17.3% to 41.4%) (defibrotide vs 
control, difference of -17.7% [95% CI  -33.6% to 2.0%]). Although the study was not in patients 
given defibrotide for prophylaxis of VOD or GvHD, the author concluded that the results  
supported the previously observed protective effect that defibr otide appeared to have on the 
incidence and severity of aGv HD. The author stated that the finding may be mechanistically 
related to down-regulation of heparanase or inhibition of T- cell activity, which preclinical and 
clinical studies have demonstrated wit h the use of defibrotide. 
1.5. Justification for Dosage and Dosage Regimen  
The dosage of defibrotide selected for this study is 25 mg/kg/day, administered intravenously as 
4 2-hour infusions of 6.25 mg/kg every 6 hours beginning prior to the start of the  conditioning 
regimen (may have completed 1 -4 doses of defibrotide prior to conditioning) for a recommended 
duration of ≥21 days and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_684581] +[ADDRESS_927481], while not imposing 
unnecessary inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684582] 21 days of study drug admi nistration .  
The safety of defibrotide 25 mg/kg/day as prophylaxis has been demonstrated in children at high risk of VOD who received MAC  (Corbacioglu et al  2012). Incidences of adverse events ( AEs), 
serious adverse event s (SAEs), and events leading to discontinuation were similar between the 
defibrotide and control groups (207 SAEs in 108 patients in the defibrotide group and 231 SAEs in 103 patients in the control group). The most common AE s considered by [CONTACT_684636] w ere hemorrhage -type events . During the prophylactic phase of the study, 
hemorrhage- type events were reported in 17.5% of patients in the defibrotide group vs 13.6% of 
patients in the control group. There was no notable difference between study arms in the incidence of any specific hemorrhage- type event. Overall, most fatal AEs were either neoplasms 
(12 [7%] patients in the defibrotide group and 14 [8%] patients in the control group) or infections (6 [3%] patients in the defibrotide group and 11 [6%] patients in the control group).

prevent more severe and/or other organ involvement. Initial immunosuppression treatment with 
systemic steroids will ultimately fail in up to 40% of patients and is associated with multiple possible side effects, including an increased risk of systemic infection due to further immunosuppression and an increased probability of immunosuppressant drug toxicity (eg , renal 
toxicity) ( Pavletic and Fowler 2012). Overall, these data suggest that a reduction in Grade B-D 
aGvHD at Day  +[ADDRESS_927484] widely used grading scales in aGvHD prevention trials are the Consensus C riteria 
(Przepi[INVESTIGATOR_20360] 1995) and the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) 
Severity Index ( Rowlings et al 1997). These [ADDRESS_927485] been shown to correlate well with treatment response and patient survival. In the proposed study, collection of data for the diagnosis and staging of  aGvHD will  be based on the recommendation of the Mount Sinai Acute GvHD 
International Consortium (MAGIC;  Harris et al 2016 ; Appendix 2). Grading of aGvHD for 
assessment of the primary and applicable secondary efficacy endpoint s will be based on the 
IBMTR Severity Index ( Rowlings et al 1997; Appendix 3). As sensitivity analyses, all 
GvHD-related efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed using the modified Consensus Criteria detailed in the aGvHD grading system from MAGIC  (Harris et al 2016 ; Appendix 4).  
In the proposed study, the primary endpoint is the cumulative incidence of Grade  B-D aGvHD  
by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_927486]. Given defibrotide’s postulated mechanism of action in 
protection/stabilization of EC  and the proposed treatment re gimen for a recommended  ≥21 days

versus-host disease is a common c omplication o f allogeneic HSCT that classically presents prior 
to Day +[ADDRESS_927488] 
important ris k factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_14478] B-D aGvHD are the use of stem cell grafts from 
unrelated donors ( Flowers et al 2011, Arora et al 2009 ) and the use of MAC  regimens 
(Jagasia et  al 2012).  
Allogeneic transplant patients receiving stem cell grafts from donors most genetically unlike 
themselves (unrelated donors and/or patient-donor pairs who are mismatched at genetic loci [ ie, 
HLA mismatched]) have the highest risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_684584]. Appr oximately 40 %-59% of adult and pediatric 
patients receiving allogeneic transplants from unrelated donors develop clinically signific ant 
moderate or severe (Grade B-D) aGvHD, despi[INVESTIGATOR_684585] (Jagasia et al 2012, Jacobsohn 2008). The prognosis for these patients is 
poor. First-line therapy consists of intravenous steroids, but nearly 40% of all patients with 
Grade B-D aGvHD are refractory to steroid -based therapy, and further treatment options are 
limited. Second-line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_684586], high failure rates, and  
patients with steroid refractory GvHD have 1- year overall survival rates of approximately 
20%-30% ( Pavletic and  Fowler 2012 ). In addition, approximately 8%-30% of pa tients with 
unrelated donors will develop severe (Grade C-D ) aGvHD (Jagasia et al 2012, Jacobsohn 2008), 
with estimated 5 -year survival rates of 25% (Grade  C) and 5% (Grade  D) (Cahn et al 2005).  
Patients receiving the most cytotoxic conditioning regimens ( ie, MAC) have  a somewhat  
increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_684587] e to 
the gastrointestinal tract. This promotes release of inflammatory cytokines and translocation of 
gut bacteria ( Harris et al 2013 ), both of which stimulate and amplify the cytokine cascade that is 
central to the pathophysiology of aGvHD ( Couriel et al 2004). Reduced intensity conditioning 
regimens have been used in older patients to avoid transplant-related morbidity and mortality, 
but while initial engraftment is  often incomplete and mixed donor chimerism evolves over time 
to full donor chimerism, these regimens have not substantially truncated the risks of GvHD and the accompanying immunologically -based anti -tumor effects (Weisdorf 2017).  
Patients with acute leuk emia (CR1 or CR2) or MDS who have received MAC  and undergo 
allogeneic HSCT with unrelated donor grafts represent 19% (20% adult and 17% pediatric) of  
allogeneic transplants in the European Union (EU) and 21% (23% adult and 17% pediatric) of allogeneic transplants in the US (Passweg et al 2016 , Pasquini and Zhu 2015). This population 
excludes patients with advanced disease and represents a well -defined, high-risk group that is 
relatively homogeneous in its risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_684588], while remaining broad enough to represent a significant proportion of the allogeneic HSCT population. In addition, the Sponsor has included both PBSC  and BM as graft sources in this study. This allows for the inclusion of

    both adult (who receive more PBSC grafts) and pediatric (who receive more BM grafts) patients. 
Allowing grafts from these sources is not likely to affect overall background risk, because results from a Phase 3 randomized trial demonstrated no differ ence in the incidence of Grade B-D 
aGvHD or survival between PBSC and BM grafts from unrelated donors in patients who 
received either MAC or RIC (Anasetti et al 2012 ). The reduction of aGvHD is expected to be 
similar in both adult and pediatric  patients. W ith approximately 80% adult patients estimated to 
be in the study, the overall background incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD is estimated to be approximately 44%. 
In summary, adult and ped iatric patients with acute leuk emia or MDS who  undergo MAC or RIC 
prior to receiving PBSC or BM grafts from URDs are a patient population at high risk of aGvHD 
and have an unmet medical need for improved aGvHD prophylaxis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
1.8. Potential Risks  
The defibrotide clinical development program, spanning over 20 years, comprises 8 clinical studies, as well as expanded access/compassionate use programs, examining defibrotide in both the VOD treatment and prevention settings. The overall defibrotide safety database includes patient data from clinical trial and post-approval use. As of April 2017, over [ADDRESS_927489] received defibrotide: approximately [ADDRESS_927490]-approval use. Safety data for prophylactic use of defibrotide is available from the randomized, prospective Study 2004-000592-33 (prevention of VOD in high risk pediatric patients post- HSCT).  
In Study 2004-000592- 33, defibrotide at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day administered as prophylaxis in 
pediatric patients undergoing HSCT at high risk for VOD was generally safe and well tolerated. In the prophylactic phase of the study, 353 patients were randomized and treated (n=177 defibrotide and n=176 controls). Between patients who received defibrotide prophylaxis and patients in the control arm who received no VOD prophylaxis (but received standard care post-transplant), respectively, there were similar incidences overall of AEs (79.7% vs 80.1%), AEs leading to death (14.1% vs 10.2%), severe AEs (32.2% vs 27.8%), and AEs leading to discontinuation (7.3% vs. 6.3%). The most commonly reported AEs during the prophylactic phase of the study were typi[INVESTIGATOR_21885] a high -risk pediatric population undergoing HSCT and were 
generally balanced between the study arms. The overall incidence of AEs considered related to defibrotide was low (5.1%). Treatment- related AEs reported in more than 1 patient were 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (reported in 2 patients each). During the prophylactic 
phase of the study, hemorrhage events were reported in 31 (17.5%) patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm compared with 24 (13.6%) patients in the control arm. There was no notable difference between study arms in the incidence of any specific hemorrhage event.

Defibrotide (JZP -963)  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  
Clinical Trial Protocol: JZP963- [ADDRESS_927491]. Clinically seve re hemorrhage is 
reported in 12-27% of all post-HSCT patients, and in a study of over [ADDRESS_927492] clinically significant hemorrhage was independently associated with a diagnosis of 
VOD (odds ratio=2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.6; Gerber et al 2008 ). Fatal hemorrhage has been reported to 
occur in 3-5% of all HSCT patients (Gerber et al 2008, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_684578] 2006, Nevo et al 1998). In 
this population, causality is difficult to determine given multiple comorbidities in VOD patients with associated organ dysfunction such as infection/sepsis, coagulopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular coagulation, GvHD, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], and systemic inflammatory reaction.  
Therefore, given the potential benefit to patients in decreasing the incidence of Grade B-D 
aGvHD (Section 1.4), and no appreciable safety concerns in data from the use of defibrotide in 
the treatment and prevention of VOD post-HSCT, the benefit-risk evaluation is considered to be positive for this study of defibrotide for the prevention of aGvHD.  
Please refer to Section 6 of the defibrotide IB for additional details and guidance for the

diagnosis of aGvHD and treatment decisions will be based on clinical judgment with guidance 
on clinical data collection and clinical staging from the recommendations of MAGIC  
(Harris et al 2016; Appendix 2). An overview of the study design is illustrated in  Figure 1. 
A total of 150 patients are planned for enrollment in the study. After informed consent and/ or 
assent is obtained from patients, parents /legal guardians or representatives, as applicable, 
screening procedures will be performed within 28 days of the scheduled start of the patient’s 
HSCT conditioning regimen. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive defibrotide 
prophylaxis 25 mg/kg/day in addition to standard of care immunoprophylaxis (“defibrotide prophylaxis arm”) or standard of care immunoprophylaxis alone (“standard of care arm”) in a 
1:[ADDRESS_927509] of MTX or MMF  + calcineurin 
inhibitor (CSA or TAC ) +/- ATG, with dosing and treatment schedules per local institutional 
guidelines, physician preference, and patient need.
 Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_21407]  (<17 years vs ≥17 years), geographic al region (North America vs Europe), and use of 
ATG (ATG vs no-ATG) using an interactive response technology (I RT). Use of ATG will be 
limited to 30% of patients . 
All patients enrolled in the study ( defibrotide prophylaxis and standard of care arms) should 
receive individualized standard of care immunoprophylaxis therapy based on local institutional 
guidelines, physician preference,  and patient need. This standard of care therapy , intended to 
serve as a study control for comparison with those patients randomized to receiving  defibrotide 
prophylaxis, will not be provided by [CONTACT_1034] . Patients randomized to the defibrotide 
prophylaxis arm  should receive standard of care immunoprophylaxis therapy added to 
defibrotide prophylaxis. Prophylactic use of defibrotide added to standard of care immunoprophylaxis (defibrotide prophylaxis arm) will be compared to standard of care 
immunoprophylaxis alone ( standard of care arm). 
Patients randomized to the defibrotide prophylaxis arm will receive defibrotide prior to the start 
of conditioning therapy (may have completed 1 -4 doses of defibrotide prior to conditioning) for a 
recommended duration of ≥21 days (and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_684581] +[ADDRESS_927510]) at a dose of

need to clearly demonstrate the diagnosis of VOD and the use of Defitelio should be clearly stated as for use in VOD. Details of VOD diagnosis will be captu red as per the schedule of 
procedures and assessments. 
Efficacy will also be assessed through monitoring for aGvHD -free survival,  GvHD-free and 
relapse-free survival, relapse of disease, relapse-free survival, cGvHD, and overall survival.  
Steroid use will be evaluated for the treatment of aGvHD by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_927519].Other 
assessments include HRQoL, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113493]. Measurement of biomarkers in 
blood for assessment of their potential as predictive or diagnostic biomarkers of GvHD and

Safety will be assessed through monitoring of AEs, SAEs,  vital signs,  physical examination s, 
clinical laboratory  tests, and Karnofsky/Lansky performance scales  (PSs). In addition, the 
following parameters will be assessed for safety:

Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive defibrotide 25 mg/kg/day  added to 
standard of care immunoprophylaxis or standard of care immunoprophylaxis alone.  5.2.1. Defibrotide Administration  
Defibrotide solution is administered intravenously by [CONTACT_684640] a dose of 
25 mg/kg/day, divided into 4 equal doses of 6.25 mg/kg/dose given as 2-hour infusions every 6 hours. Defibrotide may be held for surgical procedures or to accommodate other urgent medication delivery without necessitating  dose modification. For surgical procedures, it is 
recommended that defibrotide administration be completed more than 2 hours prior to 
intervention. Scheduling may also be adjusted to accommodate other medications and interventions, such as dialysis. While the intent is to treat every 6 hours, the schedule may be adjusted without rendering the patient ineligible or causing protocol violation as long as the daily dose does not substantially alter. A dosing window of ± [ADDRESS_927530] 10 mg for patients weighing >[ADDRESS_927531] 5 mg for patients weighing ≤35 kg.

    After dilution, with D5W or 0.9% sodium chloride, the final concentration of defibrotide for 
administration should be in the range of 4 mg/mL  to 20 mg/mL, as appropriate for infusion over 
2 hours. Detailed procedures for preparation of study drug will be provided separately. 
If a patient on defibrotide develops bleeding or hypersensitivity, defibrotide should be 
discontinued. Additionally, temporary discontinuation of defibrotide is recommended for patients at significant ris k of major bleeding who are receiving defibrotide and undergo surgery 
or invasive procedures (see Section  1.8). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Defibrotide Prophylaxis 
For patients randomized to receive defibrotide prophylaxis, defibrotide will be administered prior 
to the start of the conditioning regimen  (may have completed 1 -4 doses of defibrotide prior to 
conditioning) for a recommended prophylaxis duration of ≥21 days and ending no later than 
Day +[ADDRESS_927532]

and receiving defibrotide prophylaxis at the time of diagnosis may continue to receive 
defibrotide at the discretion of their physician up to Day +[ADDRESS_927537]. 
Note: There are no known benefits in the use of defibrotide as treatment for aGvHD. Patients in 
the defibrotide prophylaxis arm who have discontinued defibrotide prophylaxis and are subsequently diagnosed with aGvHD prior to Day+30 may not re- start defibrotide  as treatment 
for aGvHD . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Defitelio Rescue Treatment for Patients who  Develop VOD 
If a patient in either the defibrotide prophylaxis arm or standard of care arm develops VOD during the course of the study, the investigator may treat with Defitelio (commercially available defibrotide) if clinically indicated. Investigators should not use study drug for th e treatment of 
VOD. If patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm are diagnosed with VOD prior to Day +[ADDRESS_927538] and are receiving defibrotide prophylaxis at the time of diagnosis, they may continue to receive defibrotide up to Day +[ADDRESS_927539] be captured on the appropriate case report form.

    6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1. Informed Consent/Assent  
All patients will provide their written informed consent and/or assent, as applicable, before any 
study-related procedures are performed. Parents /legal guardians or representatives of minor 
patients will also provide written informed consent in accordance with local Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) requirements.   
Each patient’s chart will have his or her signed informed consent form ( ICF) and/or assent form 
for study participation att ached to it. When the study treatment is completed and the e CRF has 
been monitored, the ICF will be kept in the investigator’s central study file. Regulatory 
authorities may check the existence of the signed ICF in this central study folder. All patients will be given a copy of their signed ICF.  
6.2. Medical History, Information Pertaining to Underlying Disease / 
Any Prior HSCTs, and Current HSCT  
6.2.1. Medical History  
A complete medical history including standard body systems and any ongoing infections will be collected.  
6.2.2. Information Pertaining to Underlying Disease 
Information pertaining to the underlying disease, including date of initial diagnosis, date of 
recurrent disease, if applicable, prior treatment for diagnosis (eg , surgery, radiation, 
chemotherapy), if applicable, will be collected.  
6.2.3. Information Pertaining to Current  HSCT 
Information pertaining to the current HSCT, including type of graft, source of graft, degree of HLA matching , and any other pertinent information will be collected.  
6.3. Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy will be assessed through monitoring of patient symptoms, physical examinations, laboratory testing, imaging studies as needed, biopsy/pathology for development of a GvHD, 
disease relapse, and survival.  
6.3.1. Primary Efficacy Assessment for Cumulative Incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD

    the results of any laboratory, imaging, biopsy and/or other patient evaluations deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_684645]. However, per the MAGIC 
guidelines, aGvHD will be considered present and counted as an event in the evaluation of all aGvHD endpoints if the confidence l evel for the diagnosis is either “Confirmed” or “Probable” 
per criteria detailed in Table 1. Confidence levels for attribution of symptoms to a diagnosis of 
aGvHD are based on treatment decisions made by [CONTACT_15370]. When symptoms develop that are concerning for aGvHD, an overall confidence level is assigned to the diagnosis of aGvHD based on the highest organ- specific confidence level assigned  as supported by [CONTACT_684646] 
(eg, biopsy results and infectious studies) and by [CONTACT_684647] ( Table 1). Thus, each target 
organ is assigned a confidence level and the highest confidence level in any organ becomes the 
overall confidence level for the diagnosis of aGvHD (“Confirmed” is the highest confidence level). Please see Appendix 2 for further details on the MAGIC guidelines for aGvHD data 
collection, staging and grading.

Note: Because aGvHD rarely occurs prior to Day +[ADDRESS_927551] and symptoms such as rash, nausea, and diarrhea are often 
present, a confidence level of “Possible” is not entertained in this early time period. However, when aGvHD is diagnosed and 
treated, a confidence level of “Probable” or Confirmed” can be assig ned during the first [ADDRESS_927552] depending on 
whether aGvHD is biopsy -proven.  
a If GvHD in 1 organ (eg, gastrointestinal  tract) is being treated and another sy mptomatic organ does not have GvHD (eg , 
liver biopsy confirms VOD and absence of GVHD) , then the symptom in the non-Gv HD organ does not need to resolve without 
treatment for the organ to be considered uninvolved (and negative confidence level ).

    The aGvHD  diagnosis date is the earlier of the following:  
• Date physician clearly determines, or confirms in response to a query, a diagnosis of aGvHD 
(Probable  confidence level [CL]), or  
• Date systemic treatment is started for a presumed diagnosis of aGvHD as the most likely 
etiology for symptoms (Probable  CL), or 
• Date a biopsy was performed that demonstrates the presence of aGvHD (Confirmed  CL)  
Biopsy reports will be assessed locally. Pathology results will be used to assess aGvHD target organ confidence levels per MAGIC ( Appendix 2).  
The primary endpoint is the cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_927553] and assigned an overall confidence level for aGvHD diagnosis of either “Confirmed” or 
“Probable.”  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Staging of aGvHD 
Staging of aGvHD will be based on target organ criteria as described per  MAGIC ( Appendix 2).
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Grading of aGvHD 
Grading of aGvHD for  assessment of the primary and applicable secondary efficacy endpoints 
will be based on the IBMTR Severity Index ( Rowlings et al 1997; Appendix 3). As sensitivity 
analyses, all GvHD -related efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed using the modified 
Consensus Criteria detailed in the aGvHD grading system from MAGIC ( Harris et al 2016 ; 
Appendix 4).  Refer to Section 9.8 for additional details.  
6.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments  
Secondary efficacy assessments include Grade B-D aGvHD -free survival  by [CONTACT_52996] +100 and 
+[ADDRESS_927554]; cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by  [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_927555];

6.6. Health Economics ( Duration of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7985]) 
The duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (including any re-admissions) will be recorded in the eCRF as the date and time of admission and the date and time of discharge. As a subset of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684597], the duration of days spent in the intensive care unit (ICU) will be recorded in the eCRF as 
the date and time of admission to the ICU and the date and time of discharge from ICU.  
6.7. Biomarker Assessments  
Blood samples (3 mL for pediatric patients; 7 mL for adult patients) to evaluate plasma concentration of potential GvHD biomarkers will be obtained from all patients  (weighing

To ensure patient safety, biomarker sampling will not be done in any patient predicted to exceed 
the blood draw maximums detailed in Appendix 6. 
6.8. Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed through monitoring of AEs, SAEs, vital signs,  physical examination s, 
clinical laboratory tests , neutrophil and platelet engraftment and graft failure , Karnofsky/Lansky 
PSs, and infectious disease. 
6.8.1. Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered related to study drug or procedure.  
Adverse events i nclude, but are not limited to, the following: (1) a worsening or change in 
nature, severity, or frequency of conditions present at the start of the study; (2) patient 
deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; (4) drug interaction; an d/or 
(5) laboratory values  assessed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_093] . 
All AEs, whether observed by [CONTACT_093], reported by [CONTACT_102], determined from 
laboratory findings, vital signs, physical examinations, or other means, must be recorded.  
Patients should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any 
specific symptom. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis (including 
syndromes) based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. When a diagnosis or syndrome is established or confirmed, the diagnosis or syndrome, not the individual signs/symptoms, should be documented as the AE.

Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness, outcome, action taken with study drug, and causal relationship to the study drug or procedure. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity Assessment  
Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_684648] (CTCAE), version 4.03. All appropriate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE v4.03. A copy of the CTCAE v4.03 can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  
If the CTCAE grade is not specified for a particular event  or if the event term does not appear in 
the CTCAE, general guidelines for grading severity of AEs are provided in Table 3. 
When the severity of an AE c hanges over time, an increase in the severity will be recorded as a 
new AE, and the original AE will stop when the new AE starts.

    [IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is an AE that fulfills any of the following criteria, as per International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) E2A.II.B: 
• Is fatal (results in dea th) 
• Is life-threatening (Note: The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the patient 
was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that could 
hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe. G rade [ADDRESS_927570] are not necessarily serious unless the patient was at immediate risk of death.) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010]  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or disability , defined as substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is an important medical event 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above in the definition of an SAE. 
Examples of such  medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Suspected tr ansmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important 
medical event.  
An AE should be recorded as an SAE when it meets at least one of the criteria for seriousness.

Overdose, medication errors, and drug misuse of the study drug are considered reportable experiences and should be reported by [CONTACT_684649]. The form and contact [CONTACT_684650].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Causal Relationship to Study Drug or Procedure  
The investigator’s assessment of the relationship of AE to study drug and to study procedures is required. The relationship or association of the study drug or procedure in causing or contributing to the AE wil l be characterized using the following classification and criteria:  
Related to Study 
Drug or Procedure There is a reasonable possibility that the study drug or procedure caused 
the event, ie, there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.   
Some tempo ral relationship exists between the event and the administration 
of the study drug or procedure and the event is unlikely to be explained by 
[CONTACT_102]’s medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.  
  
Not Related to 
Study Drug or 
Procedure There is  not a reasonable possibility or clinical evidence that the study 
drug or procedure caused the event.  
The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_244130]’s 
underlying medical conditions, concomitant therapy, or accident; or there is no temporal relationship between study drug or procedure and the event. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event Recording and Reporting  
For patients in either the defibrotide prophylaxis or standard of care arm, the investigator must 
record all AEs and SAEs that occur from the time written informed c onsent is obtained until 
Day +[ADDRESS_927571] (or screen failure), regardless of their relationship to study drug or 
procedure.  
For patients who do not receive HSC T, AEs will be collected up to 70 days after baseline.  
In addition, a ny SAE assessed as related to study drug or study procedures by [CONTACT_684651] +[ADDRESS_927572] information  for submission of the form, will be provided to the study sites separately.

Clinical Trial Protocol: JZP963- [ADDRESS_927573] provide his/her assessment of causality to the study drug and the study procedure at the time of the initial report.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs assessed as not related to study drug or procedure, including clinically 
significant laboratory tests, or physical examination findings, must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the final study visit occurs, whichever comes first.  
AEs and SAEs assessed as related to study drug or procedure will be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the patient’s safety, or until th e event stabilizes, or the patient is 
lost to follow up. If resolved, a resolution date should be recorded . 
AEs and SAEs resulting in termination will be followed to the satisfactory resolution and 
determination of outcome as ascertained by [CONTACT_093] (and/or the Sponsor or its designee). 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the event. This may include additional clinical la boratory testing or investigations, examinations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals as is practical, according to the Sponsor’s requests. 
The investigator should provide follow-up SAE information for any updates to information 
previously provided to the Sponsor or as requested by [CONTACT_1034]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy  
Patients’ HSCT preparative regimens  commonly include agents which may cause infertility and 
are known to have teratogenic effects . As such, there is a low likelihood that patients may 
become pregnant. H owever, due to the teratogenic effects of the preparative regimens, and the 
unknown effects of defibrotide use during pregnancy, highly effective methods of contraception 
are required (see Section 4.1, inclusion criterion #7).  
If a female patient (or female partner of a male patient) of childbearing potential becomes 
pregnant at  any time after the first dose of study drug  and up to Day +[ADDRESS_927574] be stopped for any pregnant 
patient (see Section 6.9.1).  
The pregnancy of a female patient  (or female partner of a male patient) must be followed until 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known, and in the case of a live birth, for 6 months following the birth of the child. The I nfant Follow-up Form should be used to report information regarding 
the status of the infant.

Clinical Trial Protocol: JZP963- [ADDRESS_927575] information for submission of 
the form, will be provided to the study sites separately. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Regulatory Reporting 
The Sponsor or its designee is responsible for reporting to the relevant regulatory authorities, 
central ethics committees (CECs), and participating investigators, and will report in accordance with ICH guidelines, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the EU  Clinical Trial 
Directive, and  local regulatory requirements.  
The reference safety information to determine expectedness of SAEs is specified in the IB for 
defibrotide. 
All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be reported to the relevant 
regulatory authorities, CECs, and all participating investigators no later than [ADDRESS_927576] 
knowledge of the event. 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are fatal or life -threatening will be reported to the relevant regulatory authorities, 
CECs, and participating investigators no later than 7 day s after knowledge of such a case, and 
relevant follow-up information provided within an additional 8 days. Once a year throughout the clinical study, a report listing of all S[LOCATION_003]Rs (and SAEs if required 
by [CONTACT_1295]) that have occurred during this period and a report of the patient's safety will be submitted to the applicable authorities, and as otherwise required by [CONTACT_1207]. 
Reporting of SAEs by [CONTACT_299940]/her local IRB/IEC will be done in accordance with 
the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC. Adequate documentation must be 
maintained showing that the IRB/IEC was properly notified. 
6.8.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at local laboratories. It is anticipated that patients will 
undergo laboratory testing both as an inpatient and an outpatient. The investigator will provide to the Sponsor or its designee the current licensure and laboratory reference ranges for all laboratories used during the study.  
Refer to Appendix 1 for the individual laboratory tests to be performed during the study. If a 
patient is at risk for exceeding maximal allowable blood draw limits (per Seattle Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684602],  Appendix 6), the blood draw schedules for 
laboratory assessments may be adjusted per local physician ’s practice to ensure patient safety 
and to remain below the blood draw maximums. Laboratory values  assessed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_684652] (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

    6.8.3. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured through Day +[ADDRESS_927577] be recorded (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
6.8.4. Physical Examination 
Complete physical examination, including weight and assessments of the skin, head, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, and a general assessment (including edema)  will be performed. Height will be measured at baseline only.  
Adverse events determined from physicial examinations must be recorded (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
6.8.5. Neutrophil and Platelet Engraftment  
Patients will be monitored for engraftment per the Schedule of Procedures and Assessments (Appendix 1). If a patient is discontinued early from the study, engraftment status can be 
reported at the early terminatio n visit.  
The investigator will determine the dates for neutrophil engraftment and platelet engraftment based on an  algorithm, as described in the subsequent sentences. The dates for neutrophil and 
platelet engraftment will be recorded separately. The date of neutrophil engraftment is defined as the first date after HSCT of an absolute neutrophil count >0.5 x 10
9/L that is maintained for 3 
consecutive days. The definition of “absolute neutrophil count” includes both segmented neutrophils and “bands”, immature neutrophils. The date of platelet engraftment is defined as the first date after HSCT of a platelet count >20  x 10
9/L without a platelet transfusion in the 
preceding 7 days.  
6.8.6. Karnofsky/Lansky Performance Scores  
Functional impairment will be assessed usin g the Karnofsky PS for patients ≥16 years of age and

well. 
Guidance: Patients may be assessed for GvHD more than once per week (eg , inpatient 
where daily assessments are often  performed) but only 1 assessment should be reported . 
The GvHD staging(s) and corresponding date that should be reported for an assessment 
period should be:

the staging and date of  the clinical assessment.  
o If GvHD staging was performed on multiple days during an assessment period, and the staging did not change during the assessment period, report the staging 
and date closest to the end of the assessment period.

    9. PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1. General Considerations  
All study data will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070] (sample size, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables (eg, age, 
weight) and by [CONTACT_684656] (eg, gender, race). All summaries, statistical analyses, and individual patient data listin gs described below will be 
completed using Version 9.3 or later of the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute,  Inc Cary, 
NC). 
9.2. Tests of Hypotheses and Significance Levels  
The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of defibrotide added  to standard of 
care immunoprophylaxis (defibrotide prophylaxis arm) vs standard of care immunoprophylaxis 
alone (standard of care arm) for the prevention of aGvHD as measured by [CONTACT_684657] B-D aGvHD by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_927629] minimal clinically meaningful 
differences  between treatment groups at a signifi cant (type I) error level of 5%. The trial is  
designed to obtain meaningful estimates of the treatment difference of the cumulative incidence rates between the 2 treatment arms . 
9.3. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of 150 patients (75 patients per treatment arm) will provide a 90% CI  of 
(-0.28, -0.03) for the treatment difference of the primary endpoint (ie, cumulative incidence of 
Grade B-D aGvHD by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_927630]), assuming the cumulative incidence of 28.6% and 
44% for the defibrotide prophylaxis arm  and standard of care arm, respectively. The calculati on 
of the CI is based on the large sample normal approximation. The 44% cumulative incidence for 
the standard of care arm is based on published studies and results from a previously conducted study (Study 2004-000592-33). The 28.6% cumulative incidence for the defibrotide prophylaxis 
arm is projected based on a relative 35% improvement from the standard of care arm.  
9.4. Analysis Sets 
The ITT Analysis Set will include all randomized patients. Patients  will be analyzed according to 
the treatment to which they  were randomized . This is the primary analysis set for efficacy 
analysis. 
The Safety Analysis Set  will include all patients randomized to the defibrotide prophylaxis arm 
who receive at least [ADDRESS_927631]  of care arm. 
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received. This is the primary 
analysis set for safety analysis.

    9.5. Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data  
Every effort will be made to minimize missing data. For efficacy analysis  with time-to-event 
methodology, data for patients who discontinue from the study early will be included in the 
analysis of efficacy endpoints up to their censoring time. 
9.6. Pooling of Investigation Centers 
Data from all study centers will be pooled. Data may  also be pooled by [CONTACT_684658], as appropriate. 
9.7. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The 
summaries of demographics and basel ine characteristics will be provided for the Safety Analysis 
Set and the ITT Analysis Set . 
Relevant medical history findings and prior medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_684659], respectively, using descriptive statistics.  
9.8. Efficacy Endpoints and Analyses  
Grading of aGvHD for assessment of the primary and applicable secondary efficacy endpoints 
will be based on the IBMTR Severity Index ( Rowlings et al 1997). As sensitivity analyses, all 
GvHD-related efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed using the modified Consensus Criteria detailed in the aGvHD grading system from MAGIC ( Harris et al 2016 ). 
9.8.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed using the IT T Analysis Set . 
The primary efficacy en dpoint is cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD  by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_927632]. It will be estimated by [CONTACT_684660], as 
described by [CONTACT_684661] (1995) . Death prior to Grade B-D aGvHD by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_927633] will be considered as the competing risk. The difference i n the cumulative incidence 
between the 2 treatment arms will be estimated with 2 -sided 90% CI  (Zhang and Fine 2008 ) and 
the treatment comparison will be based on the Gray’s test ( Gray 1988 ). 
As a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will be repeated by [CONTACT_684662].

Clinical Trial Protocol: JZP963-[ADDRESS_927667] 2  times weekly from day of transplant (i e, HSCT Day [Day 0]) until ANC > 0.5 x 109/L for 3 days and platelet count 
>20 x 109/L without a platelet transfusion in the preceding 7 days. CBC then performed weekly through Day +[ADDRESS_927668] and at Day +[ADDRESS_927669]. 
j. Blood chemistries include: serum creatinine, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT. Blood chem istries performed at least 2 times  weekly until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. 
Blood chemistries performed weekly after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91591] +[ADDRESS_927670], then at Day +[ADDRESS_927671]. If a patient is at risk for exceeding maximal allowable 
blood draw limits (per Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684602], Appendix 6), the blood draw schedules for laboratory assessments may be 
adjusted per local physician’s practice to ensure patient safety and to remain below the blood draw maximums.  
k. Infectious disease markers  will be assessed  per institutional practice  to include at minimum: CMV, Hepatitis panel (HepB SAb, HepB SAg, HepB Core Ab, HepC Ab)  during 
screening , and CMV at Day s +100 and +[ADDRESS_927672]. 
l. Disease evaluation for acute leukemia and MDS (performed locally) includes a BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706] /or biopsy for pathology and cytogenetics. Cytogenetics, molecular, or other 
institutional a ssessment to determine Minimal Residual Disease will be recorded at screening to document patient’s pre-transplant Minimal Residual Disease status.  Bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_684616]. If disease relapse assessment can be made using only an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26679], results from assessment 
of a core biopsy are not required.  Disease relapse is defined by [CONTACT_684654]-transplant features, documented 
or not by [CONTACT_373204] y. The event is defined as an increase in size of prior sites of disease or evidence of new sites of disease, documented or not by [CONTACT_9256]. Disease relapse will be 
diagnosed when there is morphological or clinical evidence of i) reappearance of leukemia bla st cells in the peripheral blood, or ii) >5% blasts in the BM, not attributable to 
another cause (eg, BM regeneration), or iii) the appearance of previous or new dysplastic changes (MES specific) within the B M, with or without falling donor chimerism, or 
iv) the development of extramedullary leukemia or leukemic cells in the cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872], or v) institution of therapy to treat relapsed disease, including donor lymphocyte 
infusion.

females of child-bearing potential (ie , not postmenopausal or surgically sterile), and may be performed per institutional practices.  
o. Functional impairment will be assessed using the Karnofsky PS for patients ≥16 years of age and the Lansky PS for patients <1 6 years.  
p. MAGIC staging/assessmen t should be completed at least 1) weekly through Week 13, at Day +[ADDRESS_927677] and at Day +[ADDRESS_927678] (aGvHD present or not) and 2) 
at GvHD diagnosis and/or GvHD treatment and for 4 weeks of follow -up for both events (to obtain 4 weeks response data). Example: If GvHD is diagnosed at Day +[ADDRESS_927679], MAGIC staging/assessments are required at GvHD diagnosis (Day +[ADDRESS_927680]) and for 4 weeks of follow -up (with assessment periods ending on Days +107, 
+114, +121, and +[ADDRESS_927681]). The last visit of the study is the Day +[ADDRESS_927682] visit, thus follow -up visits are not required to continue beyond the Day +[ADDRESS_927683] visit.

Clinical Trial Protocol: JZP963-[ADDRESS_927684] day of stem cell infusion (ie, ends on 7, 14, 21, etc, days from the first day of transplant). Patient GvHD 
staging is reported once per assessment period except for weeks in which GvHD is first diagnosed or treated, in which case the GvHD staging should be completed on those 
days as well. 
Guidance: Patients may be assessed for GvHD more than once per week (eg, inpatient where daily assessments are often performed) but only 1 assessment should be 
reported. The GvHD staging(s) and corresponding date that should be reported for an assessment period should be:  
o If GvHD staging was performed only once during an assessment period, report the staging and date of the clinical assessment.  
o If GvHD staging was performed on multiple days during an assessment period, and the staging did not chang e during the assessment period, report the staging 
and date closest to the end of the assessment period.  
o If GvHD staging was performed on multiple days during an assessment period, report the staging for the day corresponding to t he peak staging  for that period. 
If the peak stage occurred on more than [ADDRESS_927685] to the end of the assessment period.  
o If either GvHD diagnosis or treatment develops during an assessment period, report the staging on the day of GvHD diagnosis a nd GvHD treatment  on the 
GvHD Diagnosis or Treatment form and report the peak staging from the assessment period on the Weekly form . These might be the same date but require 
separate forms (Weekly Assessment and GvHD Diagnosis/Treatment forms).  
o For assessment periods where no staging is available, report that the patient was not assessed.  Unless patient status is “Off Study”, GvHD weekly assessment 
forms need to be completed for all 13 weeks, at Day +[ADDRESS_927686] and at Day +[ADDRESS_927687]. If the patient was not assessed in Week 13, continue to 
report Weekly forms, regardless of whether GvHD is active, until the final reporting week is one in which patient was assessed.  
q. GvHD assessment questions regarding individual case scenarios may require Med ical Monitor adjudication. Additional information (eg, related labs, AEs, concomitant 
medications, etc.) will be recorded for adjudication purposes.  
r. Up to Day +[ADDRESS_927688]. 
s. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684618], dates in ICU, and dates of readmissions .  
t. Quality of life assessments include the following patient questionnaires: FACT-BMT-TOI and EQ-5D (version dependent on age group; see Section 6.5 for additional details . 
u. Blood samples to evaluate plasma concentration of potential GvHD biomarkers will be collected at baseline, on Days +7 and +[ADDRESS_927689] day of treatment with

    Appendix 2  MAGIC GvHD Guidance Manual  (adapted for use by [CONTACT_684671]) 
 
PURPOSE: To provide guidance for uniform GVHD target organ staging and data collection 
 
While comprehensive, this guidance manual does not cover every conceivable scenario and questions 
regarding individual case scenarios can be directed to the Medical Mon itor for adjudication.  
 
aGVHD Onset note:   
Historically, the term “Onset” was used to describe both the event when GVHD was diagnosed and not 
systemically treated and the event when GVHD was diagnosed and also systemically treated. These could 
occur at di fferent times . The term GVHD Onset  will not be used in this guidance, and  the terms GVHD 
Diagnosis and GVHD Treatment  will be used instead .  
The definition of each is as follows –  
The aGVHD Diagnosis date is the earlier of the following:  
o Date physician clearly determines, or confirms in response to a query, a diagnosis of acute 
GVHD. (Probable  confidence level [CL])  
o Date a biopsy was performed that demonstrates the presence of GVHD ( Confirmed  CL)  
 
The aGVHD Treatment  date is: 
o Date systemic treatment was started for GVHD  ( Probable  CL) 
Guidance:  GVHD Diagnosis and GVHD Treatment  may be reported on the same date for a patient. If 
GVHD Treatment occurs within 3 days of GVHD Diagnosis, then only one set of GVHD data and 
samples is needed for the patient. If GVHD Treatment occurs greater than 3 days from GVHD Diagnosis, 
a new event has occurred and separate data forms and samples will be collected.  
 
ASSESSMENT PERIODS  
MAGIC Staging/Assessment  should be completed at least (a) weekly through  Day 98/Week 14 
(aGVHD present or not) and (b) at GVHD Diagnosis and/or GVHD Treatment and for four weeks 
of follow-up for both events (to obtain 4 week response data).  
 
MAGIC Assessment period:  One week. Each assessment period corresponds to a [ADDRESS_927696] day of stem cell infusion (ie , ends on 7, 14, 21, etc, days from the first day of transplant). Patient 
GVHD staging is reported once per assessment period except for weeks in which GVHD is first 
diagnosed or treated, in which case the GVHD staging should be completed on those days as well.

    Gui
dance: Patients may be assessed for GVHD more than once per week (eg , inpatient where daily 
assessments are often performed) but only one assessment should be reported. The GVHD staging(s) and 
corresponding date that should be reported for an assessment period should be: 
o If GVHD staging was performed only once during an assessment period, report the staging and 
date of the clinical assessment.  
o If GVHD staging was performed on multiple days during an assessment period, and  the staging 
did not change during the assessment period, report the staging and date closest to the end of the assessment period.  
o If GVHD staging was performed on multiple days during an assessment period, report the staging for the day corresponding to the peak staging  for that period. If the peak stage occurred on more 
than one day, report the day closest to the end of the assessment period. 
o If either GVHD Diagnosis or Treatment develops during an assessment period, report the staging on the day of GVHD Diagnosis and GVHD Treatment on the GVHD Diagnosis or Treatment 
form and report the peak staging from the assessment period on the Weekly form . These might be 
the same date but require separate forms (Weekly Assessment and GVHD Dx/Tx forms).  
o For assessment periods where no staging is available, report that  the patient was not assessed. 
Unless patient status is “Off Study”, GVHD weekly assessment forms need to be completed for 
all 14 weeks. If the patient was not assessed in Week 14, continue to report Weekly forms, 
regardless of whether GVHD is active, until the final reporting week is one in which patient was 
assessed. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_684619] 15. 
 
GVHD STAGING once treatment begins:  During the initial treatment response  period (four weeks), 
the GVHD staging should be reported for the date CLOSEST to the seven day interval from the start of treatment. For example, week [ADDRESS_927697] to day 31 (i.e, at a seven day interval). This practice allows for the GVHD staging at start 
of treatment and day [ADDRESS_927698]- treatment to be used to determine day 28 treatment response. 
 
Guidance 1: Steroid therapy alone cannot determine the date of GVHD treatment because patients may 
be receiving steroids for other indications. The date of GVHD treatment is the first date that systemic 
therapy is given for GVHD (as indicated on  the GVHD treatment form).  
 Guidance 2 : Patients may be assessed for GVHD more than once per week (eg, inpatient where daily 
assessments are often performed). The GVHD staging(s) and corresponding date that should be reported 
for an assessment period during treatment should be the date closest to the multiple of seven days 
calculated from the start of treatment.  
 
SPURIOUS GVHD 
Spurious GVHD Diagnosis and/or Spurious GVHD Treatment  can occur multiple times per patient. 
Occasionally, GVHD is diagno sed, but further data review (ie , biopsy results) contradict the diagnosis. 
For example, a skin rash thought to be GVHD is proven to be infectious. In such cases, the diagnosis/treatment and weekly forms should be revised to indicate no GVHD, confidence le vel changed 
to negative, and comment field used to indicate spurious diagnosis or treatment. See also Target Organ guidance (symptoms present, steroids given for non- GVHD cause).

    BIOPSY INFORMATION  
Biopsies: Biopsy reports help determine the date of GVHD Diagnosis.  
Guidance: Biopsies sometimes take place before the medical record indicates that GVHD is present.  
o Clinical judgment determines the presence of GVHD even if biopsy results do not agree. For 
example, if a patient is staged and treated, then GVHD is considered present even if a biop sy 
indicates absence of GVHD (ie, early GVHD skin rash may be reported as normal skin by [CONTACT_135789]).  
o In order to change a diagnosis from acute to chronic GVHD, clinical features of chronic GVHD 
must be present (eg , sclerodermatous or lichenoid skin changes) and acute GVHD features must 
be resolved. Histopathology is not required and could reflect treatment induced changes, especially when intensive therapy was given over a prolonged period. Acute GVHD staging and 
grading should continue in scenarios such as this. 
 
Biopsy Result Definitions :  
The pathologist interpretation of a biopsy does not always clearly resolve whether GVHD is present or not. The below guidance is to assist in reporting the biopsy findings, but should not replace transplant 
physician involvement in data reporting. 
- Positive: GVHD is clearly identified as present on the biopsy. Note  – multiple coexisting 
processes may be presen t on a biopsy along with GVHD. If other etiologies are noted, they 
should be reported but will not change staging. (example: CMV colitis and GI GVHD both present on the same biopsy).  
- Equivocal:  GVHD and/or other possible etiologies are identified on the biopsy and the 
pathologist cannot definitively state whether or not GVHD is pr esent. (a common scenario)  
- Non-Diagnostic:  Either no abnormalities are identified, the abnormalities are insufficient to 
identify a potential etiology, or there is insufficient tissue for interpretation.  
- Non-GVHD Etiology:  One or more etiologies are identified on a biopsy, none of which are 
GVHD.  
- Unknown: The pathological results are not available by [CONTACT_684672]. 
 
Biopsy results are not changed for a completed assessment period unless the original report was incorrect 
based on the inf ormation available at the time . 
 
Multiple biopsies from the same organ:  All biopsies obtained in a given assessment period are reported. 
If a target organ biopsy is positive for GVHD, and a later biopsy for the same organ in the same or 
different assessment period is negative, the diagnosis of GVHD is unchanged (subsequent biopsies that do 
not show GVHD may reflect treatment effect).  
o Clinician can determine if a patient has GVHD despi[INVESTIGATOR_684620], non-diagnostic or equivocal 
biopsy result, or the absence of biopsy altogether.  
 If the patient has started treatment for GVHD then the confidence that GVHD is present 
is Probable.  
 If the patient has not started treatment for GVHD then the confidence that GVHD is present is Possible.  
o When a positive biopsy result is obtained and clinician determines GVHD is not present, the case 
is referred for adjudication.

GVHD confirmed in a biopsied target organ raises the confidence level from possible to probable for other target 
organs where GVHD is suspected, even in the absence of treatment.  
 
TARGET ORGAN CONFIDENCE LEVELS  
Guidance: The level of confidence that symptoms are aGVHD ( Confirmed, Probable, Possible, and 
Negative) is reported at each assessment period for each target organ.  
 
Confidence levels may change over time as new information becomes available – these changes are 
reported for the assessment period during which they occur. Prior confidence levels are not changed as these reflect the real -time assessment. When new information and discussion retrospectively alters a 
previously reported confidence level, an adjudication level , will also be recorded for the assessment 
period. For example, a skin rash treated for GVHD is recorded in real time as probable GVHD. If later information revealed that the rash was likely due to a diagnosis other than GVHD, the adjudication level 
will be recorded as possible GVHD. This strategy allows both the real-time and adjudicated confidence 
levels to be recorded when there is a disagreement. Target organ specific rules are provided below to assist in establishing the confidence level.

    Additional Guidance and Common Scenarios: 
o Symptoms are present, GVHD treatment started, but other etiologies are also present . 
Example: A patient with diarrhea thought to be from GVHD is treated with high dose steroids, 
but C. difficile toxin is also present (a GI biopsy is not available).  This is considered Probable  
GVHD and staging should be reported. 
o Symptoms are present but GVHD treatment is not given : (1) A patient has a rash which might 
be GVHD, bu t no treatment is given and no biopsy results are available. (2) A patient has 
diarrhea, but no etiology is identified and no GVHD treatment is given. These situations are considered Possible GVHD if GVHD is a potential etiology. The extent of rash or diar rhea 
volume is reported, the GVHD symptoms are staged but this is not considered a diagnosis of 
GVHD. Note: 
 If a biopsy is subsequently reported/obtained that confirms the presence of GVHD, the 
confidence level changes to Confirmed GVHD as of the date of t he positive biopsy, 
which then becomes the diagnosis of GVHD date. 
 If GVHD treatment is later initiated for persistent symptoms, the confidence level 
changes to Probable  GVHD as of the date treatment is begun.  
 Exception : GVHD skin rash ≤50% may not be treated but is diagnosed as GVHD on 
clinical grounds. This case is considered Probable  GVHD. The date of clinical staging is 
the diagnosis of GVHD date.  
o Prior to day 14 exception . [GVHD rarely develops before day 14, but symptoms are often 
present - eg , nausea, vomiting, diarrhea]. A confidence level of Possible GVHD can only be 
assigned prior to day 14 as the result of adjudication. Otherwise, Possible GVHD is not an option 
prior to day 14. 
 Report Confirmed when biopsy confirmation of GVHD is available 
 Report Probable when start of treatment has begun for GVHD target organ symptoms but 
biopsy confirmation of GVHD is not yet available 
 Report Negative  when target organ symptoms were present but no GVHD treatment was 
started and there is no confirmatory biopsy 
 If symptoms persist past Day 14, the confidence level stays the same until new evidence 
develops, such as change in symptom severity or physician judgment that GVHD should be included in the differential diagnosis(es).  
o Target organs symptoms are present, a non-GVHD etiology is diagnosed (ie, engraftment 
syndrome) but treatment similar to that used for GVHD (ie,  steroids) is given . This case is 
considered Negative GVHD.  
 If symptoms persist and the rationale for treatment is changed to GVHD treatment (eg , 
steroid dose is increased to manage presumed GVHD), the confidence level changes to 
Probable GVHD at the date of treatment change.  
 If a biopsy is subsequently reported/obtained that confirms the presence of GVHD, the confidence level changes to Confirmed  GVHD as of the date of the positive biopsy, 
which then becomes the diagnosis of GVHD date.

     Exception:  Steroid Guidance for potential GVHD – When steroids or other 
immunosuppression are given for treatment of unconfirmed aGVHD and then stopped 
within one week due to new information (ie, alternative non-GVHD diagnoses), the organ 
Confidence Levels can be downgraded by [CONTACT_684674] (Probable to Possible or, if aGVHD is no longer considered an etiology of 
symptoms, to Negative) retroactively. Furthermore, GVHD will no longer be considered 
present. 
 Steroid indication will be updated from an indication for aGVHD to an indication 
for Non-GVHD: Other: Adjudicated as not GVHD.  
 
Confidence levels when symptoms are present in multip le target organs : 
- If GVHD treatment is not being given, Possible or Negative GVHD confidence levels will be 
reported for each organ as defined in the table above.  
- If Probable  or Confirmed GVHD is present in one target organ (and treated), symptoms 
(simultaneous or that develop while still on treatment) in other target organs that are not biopsied 
at the same time are reported as Probable GVHD. This action is taken because it is not possible 
to exclude GVHD on clinical grounds in other symptomatic target org ans when treatment is being 
given. For example, if biopsy proven skin GVHD is present and treated with systemic steroids 
and diarrhea develops, then the lower GI tract will be staged for GVHD and the confidence level will be Probable  (even if an earlier GI  biopsy was negative and no other etiology diagnosed).  
 Exception:  If only topi[INVESTIGATOR_684621] (eg,  steroid creams for skin 
GVHD), other  target organs with symptoms (eg, diarrhea) will be reported as Possible 
GVHD in the absence of syst emic GVHD treatment.  
 Exception:  If other symptomatic organs do not meet the minimum requirements for stage 
1, then these should be reported as Possible (eg, diarrhea volume <500 ml/day) . 
 Exception:  Jaundice attributable to anothe r etiology (eg,  SOS) that is present prior to  
GVHD Diagnosis /Treatment  in another organ will not be considered GVHD unless confirmed by [CONTACT_9256] (see Liver GVHD Guidance section below).  
 Confirmed GVHD is reported for additional target organs ONLY when GVHD is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_684675] 
 Upper GI rule: When GVHD is present (probable or confirmed) in another target organ, 
suspected in the upper GI tract, but untreated, the UGI should be staged as 1 and 
confidence level = possible.  
 
Guidance for Complicated Scenarios:  
o Scenarios not addressed above should be referred for adjudication. 
 
Adjudication Levels: 
- When adjudication determines a different confidence level than the real time assessment, the 
Adjudication Confidence Level will be recorded as well.

    ORGAN STAGING AND SYMPTOM INFORMATION  
STAGING GUIDANCE:  
 Staging is retrospectively modified during adjudication  to take into account all information, 
including subsequent biopsy results, in order to be accurate. Confidence levels are not modified 
and should ref lect the status at the time of reporting according to Table 1.  
- There is no adjustment of GVHD staging when, along with confirmed/probable/possible GVHD, 
non-GVHD etiologies are also present.  
 For example, when a patient with hyperbilirubinemia from pre- existing veno -occlusive 
disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome develops Confirmed/Probable GVHD in 
another target organ and starts systemic GVHD therapy, liver GVHD staging will be based upon total bilirubin and not adjusted down because of the patient’s other known cause for hyperbilirubinemia.  
 Exception : GVHD skin rash ≤50% may not be treated but is diagnosed as GVHD on 
clinical grounds. This case is considered Probable  GVHD. The date of clinical staging is 
the date of GVHD diagnosis. 
 
SKIN GVHD GUIDANCE:  
o Only active rash (eg , erythema, maculopapular changes) is considered in body surface area ( BSA) 
calculations. Hyper- or hypopi [INVESTIGATOR_684622] (eg , brown/tanned rash, dry skin) 
representing post- inflammatory changes are not included in the BSA assessment.  
o Always report BSA involvement (if available), use the Rule of 9’s when necessary  
o Always report if bullae and/or desquamation are present  
o Desquamation from severe skin GVHD is categorized by [CONTACT_684676].  
o These symptoms must be caused by [CONTACT_684677] a healing process. 
o Peeling of the skin in the setting of quiescent  GVHD is not stage 4 GVHD as this can be seen as a 
normal process in healing skin.  
o Working Definition of Engraftment Syndrome:  
o No Acute GVHD 
o Some combination of the following symptoms around the time of WBC engraftment: 
 Fevers without infection  
 Rash 
 Jaundice 
 Nausea 
 Vomiting  
 Diarrhea 
o Explanation: The presence of symptoms is not sufficient to document engraftment syndrome, rather it is a diagnosis by [CONTACT_684678].  
 
Skin GVHD staging rules :  
o Stage 0: No GVHD rash  
o Stage 1: Maculopapular rash < 25% BSA  
o Stage 2: Maculopapular rash 25 – 50% BSA  
o Stage 3: Maculopapular rash > 50% BSA 
o Stage 4: Generalized erythroderma (>50% BSA) plus bullous formation and/or desquamation 
>5% BSA

    Other common etiologies for skin symptoms: Drug rash, conditioning regimen toxicity, infection, 
cytokine storm/engraftment synd rome. 
 
LIVER GVHD GUIDANCE:  
o Use total (not direct/conjugated) bilirubin for staging.  
o If jaundice is present before GVHD is diagnosed in another target organ (skin or GI), and GVHD 
is not the only diagnosis in the differential (whether in assessment or by h istory), liver GVHD 
will NOT be diagnosed. 
o If jaundice develops at the same time or after GVHD in another target organ, liver GVHD is presumed to be present. 
o Isolated liver GVHD can be diagnosed based on clinical judgment when GVHD is the only or most plausible etiology (GVHD treatment should be given to diagnose isolated liver GVHD).  
o If Bilirubin is not above 2.0 but other liver enzymes are significantly elevated from the normal, 
use comment field to note elevated values but do not stage Liver as GVHD.  
 
Liver GVHD staging : 
o Stage 0: < 2 mg/dl  
o Stage 1: 2 -3 mg/dl 
o Stage 2: 3.1 -6 mg/dl 
o Stage 3: 6.1 -15 mg/dl 
o Stage 4: >15 mg/dl 
 
Other common etiologies for liver symptoms:  Drug toxicity, conditioning regimen toxicity, VOD, TPN 
cholestasis, infection.  
 
UPPER GI GVHD GUIDANCE:  
o The determination that nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia are persistent (one of the criteria for upper GI GVHD) is based on clinical judgment. As a general rule, nausea lasting fewer than [ADDRESS_927699] two days, and anorexia without 
weight loss should not be considered persistent. 
 
Upper GI GVHD staging rules : 
o Stage 0: No persistent nausea or vomiting  
o Stage 1: Persistent nausea, vomiting or anorexia  
 
Other common etiologies for upper GI symptoms: Drug toxicity, conditioning regimen toxicity, infection, 
TPN.

    LO
WER GI GVHD GUIDANCE:  
o For diarrhea volumes, report liquid stool volume in the following order; (1) Average of 3 
consecutive days if available, (2) Otherwise the [ADDRESS_927700] to each other , (3) Otherwise 
average of 2 consecutive days, (4) Otherwise the maximum volume from the isolated day(s) available. Formed or mostly formed stools should not be quantified or counted in the estimation 
of liquid stool volume. 
o When diarrhea is reported as ep isodes instead of individual volumes:  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_113018]-quantified liquid stool will be counted as 200 cc  each for children ≥50 kg and 
adults, 4 ml/kg  for children up to 50 kg.  
o Quantified epi[INVESTIGATOR_684623]/stool: use 50% total volume 
o Positive lower GI biopsy with stool <500cc is reported as stage 0 
 
Lower GI GVHD staging (use adult staging for children ≥50kg): 
o Stage 0: Adult: < 500 ml/day;  Child: < 10 ml/kg/day  
o Stage 1: Adult: 500–999 ml/day; Child: 10 -19.9 ml/kg/day 
o Stage 2: Adult: 1000-1500 ml/day;  Child: 20 – 30 ml/kg/day 
o Stage 3: Adult: >1500 ml/day;  Child: > 30 ml/kg/day  
o Stage 4: Severe abdominal pain with or without ileus, or grossly bloody stool (regardless of stool 
volume). 
o For stage 4 GI: the term “severe abdominal pain” is defined as:  
     (a) Pain that requires start of narcotic use, or a substantial increase in on -going narcotic 
use, PLUS  
(b) Pain that significantly impacts performance status, as determined by [CONTACT_1963]. 
o When gross blood is used for staging: Bloody diarrhea is staged as 4, even if low volume. Blood streaked low volume (<500 mL) stools (as can be seen w/ bleeding hemorrhoids 
for example) are staged as 0.  
 
Other common etiologies for lower GI symptoms: Drug toxicity, conditioning regimen toxicity, infection. 
 
SYSTEMIC STEROIDS AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE TREATMENT/PROPHYLAXIS 
GVHD prophylaxis Guidance:  
o Report actual, not planned, GVHD prophylaxis given. For example, if CSA  is planned, but 
tacrolimus is actually given, report tacrolimus. If methotrexate is planned an d at least one dose is 
given, even if one or more doses is not, report methotrexate as a prophylaxis.  
o If prophylaxis changes prior to, or after, Diagnosis of GVHD/Start of Treatment for GVHD [eg , 
an intolerance to one agent leads to replacement with another agent(s)], report the replacement 
agent(s) and report this as a change in prophylaxis 
o Report all GVHD prophylaxis agent(s) given during the assessment period, indication will be 
GVHD

    General guidelines: 
o Each weekly assessment period should report all GVHD treatments given (immunosuppressive or 
otherwise), regardless of whether GVHD is present,  
o Systemic steroids administered as “one- time” doses, or given for a [ADDRESS_927701] for reaso ns other 
than GVHD treatment (eg,  mucositis, nausea/vomiting, premedication for transfusion, etc) will 
not be collected.  
o Admission body weight is used for conversion of steroid dose to mg/kg; unless the clinician specifies a different body weight to use (eg, admission weight is inaccurate due to fluid overload). 
Use outpa tient clinic visit weight if treatment for GVHD is started during an outpatient visit. The 
weight recorded at the start of steroids should be used on all subsequent forms and for 
calculations for steroid dosing.  
o Steroid dose and form (prednisone, methylprednisolone, etc ) should be reported corresponding to 
the date of GVHD assessment for that week. The dose being given on the date of GVHD assessment should be the one reported, even if the dose is changed one or more times during the 
assessment period.  
 Exception: When steroid therapy begins during the assessment period, report the starting 
dose. 
o Indication for steroid therapy should be reported. 
o If the patient develops GVHD while on steroid therapy for another indication, and the dose of steroids is changed, report the new dose of steroids as the treatment dose given for GVHD , the 
new indication for steroid therapy, and the date of the dose change. 
o Other agents: list all other agents being given for GVHD treatment and/or prophylaxis.  
o If a patient is receiving extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), report the number of ECP treatments 
given during the assessment period. 
o If the patient is on a study where the treatment assignment is not known (blinded), report this as 
experimental treatment and report which potential agents the patient may be receiving (ie,  report 
both the study drug AND placebo). 
o Topi[INVESTIGATOR_684624] t be collected.  
 
Common indications for steroid treatment: GVHD treatment, GVHD prophylaxis, Cytokine 
storm/Engraftment syndrome, IPS 
 aGVHD Data Collection :

    Do
nor Cellular Infusion (DCI) Data Collection:  
Report any DCIs occurring since the last reporting period. If multiple infusions have occurred then report 
up to 3. DCI’s can be multiple different cell types and are given for multiple indications.  
 
The most common reason for DCI is to treat relapse (instead  of a subsequent txp), and ma y be preceded 
by [CONTACT_11553].   If DCI has been given, keep collecting GVHD Weekly data and Survival data. Patients do not come Off 
Study for DCI. 
Report “N/A” only if patient has not been seen since last report. 
 
Report the t ype of cell used for the infusion:  
Lymphocytes, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells, Dendritic cells from the original donor, 
Mesenchymal cells, Other (specify)  
Report the reason why the DCI was given:  
Planned, Treat disease, Treat PTLD or EBV -Lymphoma, Treat Viral infection, Treat GVHD, 
Mixed Chimerism, Graft Failure, Other (specify) 
 3
rd Party Infusion Data Collection:  
Report any 3rd party infusions given si nce the last reporting period. If multiple in fusions have occurred 
then report up to 3. Third party infusions are from donors other than the original donor or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
 If [ADDRESS_927702] party infusion. 
Report “N/A” only if patient has not been evaluated since last report.  
 Report the date of infusion.  
Relapse Data Collection:  
Report if the patient has Relapsed since the last reporting period.  
 
If “Yes”, please indicate date relapse occurred. If relapse has previously been reported at any time, click 
“Previously Reported”.  Report “N/A” only if patient has not been evaluated since last report.  
If Relapse has occurred keep collecting GVHD Weekly data and Survival data.  
 Report the dat e of relapse.  
 
Subsequent Transplant Data Collection:  
Report if the patient has had a Subsequent Transplant si nce the last reporting period.  
 
If “Yes”, please indicate date occurred. If this has previously been reported at any time, click “Previously 
Reported”.  
Report “N/A” only if patient has not been seen since last report. 
If Subsequent Transplant is Yes, Weekly GVHD data collection ends, but survival data will still be 
collected.  
 Report the date of the subsequent BMT

Pa
tient Survival Data Collection:  
Indicate if patient is Alive, Dead or Lost to Follow.  
If patient has not been seen/assessed since last follow up, indicate Lost to Follow up. 
If the patient is Alive, report the last date the patient was seen or known to be alive.  
If the patient has D ied, report the date of death. Primary and contributing cause of dea th will also be 
reported.   
Cause of Death Hierarchy:  
Cause of death is attributed to the key initiating event in the chain of events that culminate in death. It is 
inaccurate to report the proximate cause of death (eg, liver failure) when the liver failure is a result of 
severe liver GVHD. In that example, the cause of death should be recorded as GVHD. Cause of death 
may be difficult to ascertain and often requires adjudication. I n some cases, no obvious cause of death can 
be determined, in which case the adjudication represents a best medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The following hierarchy will be followed for assigning cause of death: 
 
Relapse 
Recorded at any point prior to death, supersedes all other causes of death, including GVHD and Infection, 
when any other competing etiology is also present at time of death. 
EXCEPTION: In most cases, COD can be d etermined using the above rule. In circumstances where the 
treating physician does not believe that relapse is the primary cause of death, an exception can be made with documentation emailed to the DCC and/or a comment entered into the Cause of Death comment box. All such cases will be adjudicated.  
 GVHD (Acute and Chronic)  
GVHD supersedes all other  causes of death except relapse. Relapse supersedes GVHD because relapse 
generally prompts measures that increase likelihood of GVHD (eg , abrupt cessation of 
immunosuppression or donor leukocyte infusion). 
 
Deaths occurring with active GVHD symptoms are attributed to GVHD. 
Deaths (usually incorrectly reported as Infection) are attributed to GVHD when symptoms are absent if 
the patient had been previously treated or remains on immunosuppression treatment for GVHD. The 
effect of GVHD treatment on the immune s ystem persists beyond the last treatment dose and therefore 
guidance is provided for the time off immunosuppression to consider when assigning GVHD as cause of 
death. 
 Deaths are considered due to GVHD even when symptoms are absent (ie, complete response to treatment) 
if any of the following conditions are met: 
• Patient was on 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent dose of alternative steroid) within two weeks of death 
• Patient was on 20 mg prednisone (or equivalent dose of alternative steroid) within four weeks of death 
• Patient on immunosuppressive agents ( eg, ATG, Campath, etc) other than those used for 
prophylaxis  
• In the event of missing or incomplete data, patients reported to have Grade 4 GVHD within two months of death, then COD is GVHD

    Inf
ection (specify infection) 
Infection supersedes other causes of death except Relapse and GVHD. Infections are considered 
confirmed if a Positive culture or a Confirmatory Pathology report was obtained 
 
Note: Please allow at least 5 days for pending culture reports to be f inalized after death.  
Provide the organism identified in the Specify field  
If infection led to Sepsis, please document the organism identified as well as sepsis in the Specify field  
When applicable, Infection should be listed as a secondary COD when GVHD i s the Primary COD  
 Other causes of death:  
Rejection/Poor Graft Function Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH)  
Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS)  
Veno-occlusive Disease (VOD) / Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS)  
New Malignancy, excluding PTLD Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD)  
Cardiac Event  
Examples include: Arrhythmia, Sudden Death, Coronary Artery Disease / Myocardial Infarction (MI)  
Pulmonary Event 
Examples include: ARDS, Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59499], pulmonary embolism), excludes pneumonia or other 
infectious diseases (which should be reported under Infections) 
Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA)  
Other – HSCT related (specify)  
Events not already described above but related to the transplant should be specified he re. (ie, 
Immunosuppressant overdose) 
Other – Non-HSCT related (specify)  
Events not related to the transplant itself should be specified here. Example include motor vehicle accident, homicide, and accidental death 
Unknown 
If no information is known around the time of death, and none of the above definitions are applicable, 
report Unknown COD 
 
Form Comment can be used to provide any further details about any major event, further clarification on 
the events surrounding a death, if COD has been reviewed with physician at site, if patient transf erred 
care to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the general condition of the patient at this time, etc.

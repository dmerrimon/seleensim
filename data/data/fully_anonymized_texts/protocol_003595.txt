TAASD PROTOCOL  Protocol  
Psychot
herapy for Anxiety in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (TAASD)  
Abstrac
t: 
Autism
 spectrum disorders (ASD) are common neurodevelopmental syndromes affecting 1% of U.S. 
children. Comorbid anxiety disorders affect 40 to 50% of children with ASD, causing substantial distress 
and impairment over and above that caused by [CONTACT_803796]. High anxiety is associated with increased 
severity of ASD symptoms and social maladjustment in affected youth. Further, parents of children with ASD consider anxiety -related problems to be among the to p two challenges facing their children. Although 
standard practice cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) has been established as an efficacious and safe 
treatment for anxiety disorders among typi[INVESTIGATOR_188298], its utility in comorbid cases with ASD remains unknown. To date, no studies have experimentally compared standard practice CBT to a 
cognitive -behavioral intervention that has been personalized for children with a comorbid presentation of 
anxiety and ASD.  Accordingly, we are proposing a randomized controlled trial (RCT)  to be conduc ted at 
three treatment sites to evaluate the efficacy of personalized CBT for anxiety in ASD (Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism: BIACA) relative to standard practice CBT for anxiety (Copi[INVESTIGATOR_803759]) . Furthermore, this study will employ a treatment as usual control group to assess 
the efficacy of each CBT arm relative to the normal treatment  (i.e., a Treatment As Usual control group ). 
The proposed research will: (1) examine the efficacy of BIACA relative to Copi[INVESTIGATOR_803760], which represents 
standard practice treatment,  and the efficacy of both these treatments relative to a treatment as usual  
(TAU)  control group , (2) evaluate the maintenance of treatment gains, (3) examine the impact of 
personalized intervention on functional outcomes such as social responsiveness, loneliness, and playdate 
quality, (4) test autism severity as a moderator of treatment outcome, and (5) explore other moderators 
and mediators of t reatment outcome. Youth  (ages 7-13 years) with ASD and co -occurring anxiety will be 
rand omly assigned to one of the three  conditions : BIACA, Copi[INVESTIGATOR_803760], or TAU. Considering  the rising 
number of children diagnosed with ASD together with the frequency and severity of comorbid anxiety, the proposed work is tailored to the unique needs of youth with ASD and will provide a timely contribution to public health efforts.

TAASD PROTOCOL  Additionally, several large studies of children with ASD have found strong linkages between clinical 
anxiety and increased severity of ASD symptoms, such as repetitive behaviors11, sensory symptoms20, and 
total ASD symptoms,[ADDRESS_1109489], consistent with findings in typi[INVESTIGATOR_803761].30 In addition, 
anxious/depressed symptoms in youth with ASD were associated with total and right amygdala volume, suggesting a brain -behavior relationship in which abnormal amygdala functioning in ASD could contribute 
to increased risk for anxiety.
[ADDRESS_1109490] of clinical anxiety in ASD. Individuals with ASD  experience frequent autism -
specific stress (e.g., social confusion; prevention of access to preferred activities during school), likely increasing negative affectivity —a consequence of stress.
[ADDRESS_1109491], children often develop focal anxiety symptoms.34 This heightened anxiety tri ggers: (1) a pattern of 
avoidance caused by [CONTACT_803797] (e.g., social and schoolwork avoidance) and (2) maladaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_25133] (e.g., increased repetitive behaviors) that distract from the anxiety. Given the emergi ng evidence of the biological and statistical validity of clinical anxiety in ASD, 
and the well -documented association between anxiety and social and other functional impairment in ASD, 
anxiety is a noteworthy treatment target in this population.  
CBT t reatments have produced medium to large effect- size improvements in anxiety in typi[INVESTIGATOR_803762].35-38 The Child/Adolescent Anxiety  Multimodal Study (CAMS) CBT condition yielded  a 
positive response rate on the CGI -Improvement scale of ~60%, more than doubling the placebo 
response.[ADDRESS_1109492] also found impressive outcomes.  
Several exploratory  trials offer initial evidence of possible efficacy of CBT for anxiety in ASD. Wood et al . 
conducted an exploratory clinical trial44 of an individualized CBT developed for children with ASD that 
employs a modular treatment algorithm, with similar aged youth (N=40) randomized to CBT or a waiting list. Children randomized to CBT had primary outcomes comparable to those of CBT for typi[INVESTIGATOR_469599]: 08/04/2016

(52.9% vs. 8.7%); clinical severity (d=2.5); and Social Responsiveness Scale scores (d=.75).22, 44 Storch et al. 
recently completed a randomized controlled trial (N=45) of the Wood CBT protocol relative to treatment 
as usual (TAU) in youth with ASD and comorbid anxiety. Significantly more youth responded to CBT (18/24) versus TAU (3/21) with an effect size on the PARS

funded trial of CBT for adolescents with ASD and anxiety, significantly more youth responded to a revised version of the Behavioral Interventions for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA) manual (15/1 9) 
relative to a waitlist control (3/16).  
Group therapy formats have been used in four pi[INVESTIGATOR_803764] .47-50 Limitations of 
these studies included a lack of independent ratings of outcome s, no assessment of treatment fidelity, 
non-modularized tre atment format, and in one case, a lack of random assignment. While efficient, the 
linear format of group therapy limits matching intervention techniques to patient characteristics. Given 
the hetero geneity of phenotypes in ASD, individual interventions (e.g., modular treatments) tailored to a 
patient’s specific characteristics, such as the one used in the proposed trial, are likely to be particularly 
efficacious.[ADDRESS_1109494] cognitive assets that could facilitate response to CBT 
that is tailored to their clinical presentation. Children wit h high -functioning ASD are described as being 
“very verbal” and have average to above -average cognitive and language abilities.[ADDRESS_1109495] wide variation in children’s capacity for abstract 
reasoning.53, [ADDRESS_1109496] expanded traditional anxiety -focused CBT models to address 
the ASD -related clinical characteristics (e.g., poor social skills) that may exacerbate an xiety symptoms or 
render them less treatable.  
Poor social functioning is a key autism -related deficit that requires treatment in CBT for anxiety in ASD.  
About 80% of children with ASD and anxiety in the Wood et al.44 trial met criteria for social phobia. 
Children with ASD and high social an xiety are doubly impacted: they have core social deficits related to 
ASD (e.g., impaired conversation initiation and maintenance) as well as a debilitating fear of rejection that 
is associated with social maladjustment in ASD.10 The typi[INVESTIGATOR_803765], which typi[INVESTIGATOR_803766]. However, without social skills to compensate for ASD -related social deficits,55 exposures are 
less likely to succeed because unskilled, cou nterproductive social strategies are likely to be used, making 
unsatisfying and potentially humiliating social interactions a likely outcome, thereby [CONTACT_803798].  
Because traditional social skills training approaches often do not generalize to children’s daily 
environments56, we employ an alternative model . Informed by B rewin’s memory retrieval competition 
model, our personalized CBT program builds compensatory social skills (e.g., offering guests’  choices) 
coached by [CONTACT_3654] “in the moment” in naturalistic settings (cf. the pi[INVESTIGATOR_803767]).

peer volunteers at school can be trained to include target children with ASD in their conversations, giving 
children an opp ortunity to participate in the most relevant of social settings with reduced difficulty level 
and, consequently, a higher chance of success.44, 61, 62 During CBT sessions, reflective discussions about 
these social experiences can bolster insight into complex social phenomena (e.g., a playmate’s perspective).
58, 63 These treatment elements incorporate both the encoding specificity principle (through 
the inclusion of peers in re levant settings) and deep semantic processing (i.e., reflective discussions) to 
promote memory retrieval and application of skills.

Moderators of treatment effects help answer the question “What  treatment works best for which 
patient ?” [ADDRESS_1109498] found that baseline symptom severity moderates outcome (e.g.,
70, 71). In a recent study, Puleo and K endall40 found that autism symptom severity

A similar relationship is expect ed in the present trial. For example, greater ASD symptom severity (e.g., 
social communication impairments) may be a hindrance to optimal response to standard CBT. In comparison, personalized CBT for anxiety in ASD (BIACA) uses ASD -specific adaptations and collateral 
supports to overcome ASD -related challenges. Thus, the more prominent a child’s ASD symptoms, the 
more we expect BIACA to differentially impact treatment outcome in comparison to standard CBT.  
The present trial will explore mediation.[ADDRESS_1109499] of autism -related stress (e.g., social confusion) as well as a trigger of

Resear ch P
lan: 
Overview  
The
 proposed investigation is a multi- site RCT comparing CBT that is personalized to youth with ASD and 
anxiety to standard practice CBT in youth (aged 7- 13 years) with ASD and clinically significant anxiety. We 
will randomly assign patients after screening to a CBT  intervention for anxiety in  ASD (BIACA ) versus 
standard CBT for anxiety (Copi[INVESTIGATOR_803760] ) versus treatment as usual  (TAU ). The BIACA manual is personalized 
for anxiety in youth with ASD and has been designed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_803770] ,44, [ADDRESS_1109501]- treatment and 6 -
month Follow -up.  
Participan
ts will include  children and their parents recruited using a procedure designed to ensure that 
participants evidence clinically significant anxiety at the start  of treatment in addition to their ASD 
diagnosis. Parents will be given a 20 -minute telephone screening to elicit preliminary inclusion/exclusion 
information. The screening assessment determines "caseness" (formal presentation of the informed 
consent agreement, clinical assessment).  Child - and parent -report forms will be completed at this visit.  
Inclusio
n/Exclusion Criteria  
Inclus
ion criteria:  
(1) Outpatient boys and girls with ASD (see below) between the ages 7- 13 years at consent.
(2)The child m eets cut -off criteria for A SD as determined by  [CONTACT_803802] -Second Edition74, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule -Second Edition75 and a  consensus
from PI’s across sites about the child’s diagnosis.
(3)The child m eets criteria for clinically significant anxiety symptoms as defined by a minimum score of
14 on the PARS Severity Scale and a minimum anxiety severity score of 3 on the CGI -S.
(4) The child has a Full Scale and Verbal Comprehension IQ>70 as assessed on the WASI  76. This level of
intellectual ability is frequently used to demark the boundary of “high functionin g” ASD, and we and

validity.  
(5) Participants with comorbid depression, tic disorder or disruptive behavior disorders will be
acceptable as long as the anxiety symptoms are considered the primary mental health problem (i.e.,
most impairing/distressing) after ASD. As with our IQ criteria, this entry criterion is reflective of the
ASD population, which tends to hav e multiple comorbidities (in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4250], children had an
average of 4 comorbid disorders, and the majority met criteria for ADHD),44, [ADDRESS_1109503]. (a) Eligibility will be guided by [CONTACT_803803]:For participants  presenting with comorbid symptomology, the comorbid conditions  cannot be
sufficiently severe to warrant immediate treatment or require ongoing medication titration.  (b) Each
potential participant will be discussed on the weekly cross -site SC calls and agreement across sites  will
be required for study entry. To determine principle diagnosis, the assessing clinician will determine ifany non -anxiety disorders are present through the ADIS -IV. In the instance of co -morbid diagnoses,
the clinician will establish which diagnosis is most impairing/distressing. A consensus panel consis ting
of the PIs and clinician will be used for more complicated cases.
(6) Stable psychiatric medications will be allowed if the dose has been stabilize d and the family and
psychiatrist affirm no plan to alter the dose or change medication in the forese eable future. See
exclusion criterion below regarding psychiatric medication.  The majority of children with ASD (aged 8 -
13) have been prescribed psychiatric medication.

Exclus
ion criteria:  
(1) Receiving concurrent therapy  targeting anxiety , social skills training with homework, or behavioral
interventions (e.g., applied behavior analysis). Families will have the option of discontinuing such
services to enroll. This excludes academic tutoring, occupational therapy, speech therapy, school
counseling that is no more than 60 minutes per week in duration, school aides, and social skillstraining groups that do not include homework and are no more than 60 minutes/week in duration.Families of youth with ASD often  have a variety of adjunctive services that they are reluctant to give
up, and given the limited documentation of the efficacy of such interventions for social and emotionaloutcomes, it is deemed important to permit families to retain them in the service of recruiting a
representative sample. If a potential participant is receiving non -allowed treatments at the time of the
phone screen and wishes to discontinue them to enter the study, the patient will be asked to discussthis option with their clinician t o determine safety and the child’s best interest. In addition, we will
obtain the patient’s written consent to contact [CONTACT_803804]. We will not influence the decision patients make with their clinician. If non -
allowed psychosocial treatments are discontinued, the screening assessment will not be conducted
until 1 month following termination.
(2) (a) Current clinically significant suicidality or (b) individuals who have engaged in suicidal behav iors
within 6 months will be excluded and referred for appropriate clinical intervention.
(3) Child has been nonresponsive to an adequate trial of CBT for anxiety within the previous 2 years (at
least 10 sessions over a period of less than 26 weeks co nducted by a licensed provider of CBT). This
will be determined through records review and speaking with the clinician if appropriate.
(4) Lifetime DSM -IV bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as assessed by [CONTACT_803805] (i.e., clinical history, study measures, etc.).

or he can remain on it at its current dose. While in their arm, children  will not be able to continue or 
initiate psychosocial interventions (psychotherapy, certain types of social skills training, applied 
behavior analysis targeting anxiety).

t Timeline.  Participants will be randomized following screening to receive [ADDRESS_1109504] practice CBT , or to the 16 -week TAU group . There is a 45% chance of being randomized to BIACA, 
45% chanc e of being randomized to standard practice CBT, and 10% chance of being randomized to the 
TAU  control (who will have their choice of interventions following the TAU phase ). The Mid -treatment 
assessment will be done after session [ADDRESS_1109505] -treatment will not be required to adhere to limited intervention services during the 
follow -up phase and will  be provided with community treatment refer rals ( at cost to the family ). If families 
deny the suggested maintenance plan for the follow -up phase (i.e. limited intervention services and 
monthly CBT sessions) , a follow -up assessment will still be conducted. These families will be distinguished 
from t hose who adhere to the maintenance plan. If participants do not meet inclusion for the study, their 
baseline data will be kept and used in data analysis.  
Treat

Randomiz
ation.  Participants will be randomized after screening to receive BIAC A, standard care CBT or 
TAU . There is a 45% chance of being randomized to BIACA, 45% chance of being randomized to standard 
practice CBT, and 10% chance of being randomized to the TAU control. Randomization will not be revealed 
to IEs and variable block -lengths will be used within strata to maintain balance during enrollment while 
minimizing risks of unblinding. Postdoctoral clinical psychology fellows or advanced graduate trainees in clinical psychology will provide both CBT conditions  to participants. 
BIACA.
 Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_803771] 16 weekly sessions, each lasting 90 minutes (45 minutes with 
the child and 45 minutes with the family/parents), implementing the Behavioral Interventions for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA) manual.
81 The manual  includes 4 anxiety copi[INVESTIGATOR_803772] 
(e.g., affect recognition and cognitive restructuring), which are integrated into an acronym (the “KICK” plan) to help children remember the skills. Early in treatment, a comprehensive hierarchy is developed identifying all target behaviors, including anxious and avoidant behaviors, social skill deficits, restricted and repetitive behaviors , and behavioral problems. Ultimate goals are set forth as measureable outcomes 
(e.g., “engage in appropriate peer play 100% of the time during recess”), which permits the delineation of specific proximal goals that gradually increase in difficulty. Anxiety and all other target behaviors are 
addressed using in vivo exposure therapy techniques during sessions and in the community. Therapeutic concepts are taught using multimodal stimuli (e.g., discussion scaffolded by [CONTACT_740], writing, photographs 
and cartoons, and acting) and guided Socratic questioning, relying upon children’s special interests as 
metaphors to maintain enthusiasm and motivation. Children and parents are taught friendship skills (e.g., play-date hosting; joining peers at play) in several social modules. Parents (in weekly sessions) and school

TAASD PROTOCOL  personnel (in two 1 -hour school consultations over the course of treatment) are taught to support 
children in entering and maintaining conversations or play. These skills are practiced at school, in the 
community, and on play -dates. During the school consultations, a peer “buddy” program is implemented 
to enhance social inclusion. Habit reversal procedures are implemented for repetitive behaviors, using 
incompatible replacement behaviors. All target behaviors are reinforced with a reward system. T he BIACA 
program employs a modular format that is guided by a treatment algorithm63 designed to address each 
child’s unique clin ical needs within the [ADDRESS_1109506] eight sessions focus on teaching skills to the child, whereas the second 
eight sessions provide the child the opportunity to practice newly learned skills (through exposure tasks) 
both within and between sessions (homework). The goal is to teach youth to recognize the signs of unwanted anxious arousal and to let these signs serve as cues for the use of anxiety management 
strategies. The main features of this standard CBT are: (1) recognizing anxious feelings and somatic 
reactions to anxiety, (2) identifying cognition in anxiety -provoking situations (i.e., unrealistic or negative 
expectations), (3) developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a plan to cope with the situation (i.e. modifying anxious self -talk into cop ing 
self- talk as well as identifying copi[INVESTIGATOR_803773], (4) behavioral exposure tasks, and (5) 
evaluating performance and self- reinforcement for effort.  The treatment uses behavioral training 
strategies such as modeling, imaginal and in -vivo exposure tasks, role- play, and contingent reinforcement. 
To help reinforce and generalize the skills, specific homework tasks are assigned. Parent involvement in the child’s treatment occurs (weekly update, scheduling, etc.) and parents may be included in exposure tasks. Parents consult to the child’s treatment, and given a model for assisting with the treatment in the role of the child’s “cognitive behavioral coach.”  In addition to a regular [ADDRESS_1109507] and 8th sessions, and 
prior to the end of treatment.  Parents will be given a copy of the Parent Companion,
82 a pamphlet that 
describes their child’s treatment and their potential contributions as parents to beneficial outcomes.  
TAU  Condi
tion. Participants randomized to the TAU  condition will wait for a period of 16 weeks before 
receiving treatment in the context of the study. During this time, youth may receive psychotherapy and/or initiate or change current psychiatric medication (if applicable). Eight weeks  into the TAU  period, youth 
will participate in a mid- point assessment. This assessment in conjunction with bi -weekly check- in calls will 
allow the research staff to monitor the participant during the TAU  period. If a participant’s anxiety 
worsens during this phase, the TAU  period will be  cut short and treatment will begin. After completion of 
the post assessment, these youth and their families will be offered treatment (BIACA or Copi[INVESTIGATOR_803774]).  The TAU control group will act as a comparison group for both forms of 
CBT (BIACA or Copi[INVESTIGATOR_803760]). This control group allows us to examine potential differences in response due 
to standard care available in the community versus CBT especially in the instance that both  CBT groups 
demonstrate good yet similar response rates.  The risk of the TAU condition is necessary to provide 
feasibility data regarding the utility of CBT in treating youth with ASD and comorbid anxiety, as well as provide estimates of differential outcome. Although CBT is the gold standard for typi[INVESTIGATOR_803775], this has not been sufficiently established in youth with ASD  which is a  gap in the literature that the 
current study aims to address. Past literature has examined standard CBT or CBT modified for ASD but none have compared the two.  
Therapis t
 Training. Experienced therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], postdoctoral clinical psychology fellows or advanced graduate 
trainees in clinical psychology, under supervision, will provide treatment to participants (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_803776]: 08/04/2016

TAASD PROTOCOL  Analytic Design  
Numeric
al and graphical descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data on all randomized 
patients a nd to confirm the absence of group or site differences in screening demographic and clinical 
characteristics. Distributional assumptions will be checked and appropriate transformations or non -
parametric methods will be applied as necessary.  Our primary hypotheses concern differential change 
over time in anxiety symptoms and CGI -I scores for the treatment conditions. To maximize the efficiency 
of parameter estimates and to enable us to detect the most detailed possible patterns of treatment 
effects, we will analyze the outcomes using treatment arms simultaneously, employing general linear 
mixed models (GLMMs)137 with group (BIACA, Copi[INVESTIGATOR_803760]) and time as main effec ts, and a group x time 
interaction. The primary hypotheses will then be evaluated with the group x time interaction term. Our analyses will employ identity and logistic links respectively for continuous and binary outcomes with an unstructured covariance s tructure to allow maximum flexibility for the relationships within and between 
groups. Mixed models automatically handle missing data, producing unbiased parameter estimates via 
maximum likelihood techniques as long as observations are missing at random.
138, 139 This will allow us to 
use all available data from all subjects in an intention -to-treat (ITT) framework. Moreover, we are able to 
adjust for the presence of multiple recruitme nt sites by [CONTACT_803816] a nested variable in 
the model. We are also able to control for potential confounding variables in terms of their impact on 
group differences and changes over time. To protect against Type I error, the principal analyses are 
designed to answer clearly stated major research hypotheses and are based on well -specified dependent 
variables. All tests will be reported using two -tailed family -wise significance level α=.05, using the Holm -
Bonferroni correction.140   
Definitio
n of Primary Outcome Measures:  The PARS and CGI -I are the primary outcomes. Consistent with 
CAMS,35 we define treatment response as a CGI -I rating of 5 or 6 (much/ve ry much improved).  
Specific Analyses for the Individual Study Aims:  Aims 1 -2: For Primary Aim 1, to model anxiety symptoms, 
we will use the PARS as the dependent measure in a mixed effects regression with condition as the between -
subject factor, time (Screening, Mid -treatment, Post- Treatment) as the within -subject factor and a Condition 
x Time interaction, with the latter used as evidence for differential rates of change.  For the dichotomous 
outcome, treatment response (Aim 2), we will also use mixed effe cts regression, this time with a logistic 
link, with treatment condition, time (here Mid -treatment and Post -Treatment ), and a Condition x Time 
interaction. Our primary interest is in the contrast at the end of acute treatment. The relevant continuous assessment measures for Aim 2 are described in detail in section C.5. (e.g., POPE, SRS); these scales will be 
assessed with the same model as in Aim 1. Aim 3:  For continuous outcomes, the models of Aims [ADDRESS_1109530] -treatment. Evidence of deterioration (e.g., increased symptoms) over the 
follo w-up period will also be of interest. Since all subjects in this analysis are by [CONTACT_803817], we will use mixed effects logistic regression to model the likelihood of relapse or 
recurrence over the follow- up period. We wil l also report the proportions of subjects within each 
treatment arm who ever relapse or experience recurrence. Aim 4:  To examine moderation, the interaction 
term between treatment condition and ASD severity will be used to examine changes over time for the  
continuous (PARS scores) and categorical outcomes (responder status; CGI -I). Significant interactions will 
be followed up by [CONTACT_803818], with 95% CI, for ASD severity and the outcomes. Exploratory Aim 5:  Testing the mediation hypothesis requires that the 
direct path is meaningfully attenuated when the mediator is in the model and is also a significant predictor

will be applied with select potential moderators.  
Power
 Analyses and Sample Size Considerations:  We will aim to enroll a total of N= 201 subjects, 
randomizing 90 to each treatment arm  and 21 to the TAU arm. This sample size was chosen to pr ovide the 
optimal balance between feasibility of recruitment and maximization of power for the primary and secondary aims outlined above. Assuming an attrition rate of 10% over the acute treatment period and another 15% over the [ADDRESS_1109532] approximately 81 participants per  treatment condition at the end of acute treatment and 
57 per  treatment  condition at the end of follow -up. Al l calculations use a 2 -sided significance level of 
α=.05 and assume a moderate correlation of r=.[ADDRESS_1109533] 
80% power to detect a constant two -group (BIACA treatment vs Copi[INVESTIGATOR_803784]) difference of d=.[ADDRESS_1109534]- screening treatment time points (Mid - and Post -treatment) for Aims [ADDRESS_1109535] 80% power to detect the condition x time interaction represented by a change  from no 
difference at Screening to a difference of d=.[ADDRESS_1109536] -treatment. These power calculations are 
conservative in that they are based on evaluating the two active treatment effects independently (i.e., in separate models). Our actual power, using a single two -arm model, will be higher as simultaneous 
estimation of the contrasts leads to smaller standard errors. Data from a pi[INVESTIGATOR_803785] a waitlist group yielded a very large effect size of d=2.[ADDRESS_1109537] size of d=.75 on the SRS (measure of autism symptoms).
22, [ADDRESS_1109538] group differences at any one time point, with group 
differences in the order of d = .44 during the acute treatm ent period and d = .53 at the 6 month follow -up 
resulting in 80% power at alpha = .05. For treatment response, simulations for a two conditions (two 
treatments) logistic mixed model, starting with 81 subjects per condition and assuming reasonable different ial response rate, showed over 80% power to detect a treatment effect. The two -sample test of 
proportions, which corresponds most specifically to the primary hypothesis, can detect a response rate difference of 30%  between the treatment conditions at the end of acute treatment with over 90% power using ITT LOCF (n=57 per group). Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_803786] 75 -79%
44, 46 in the BIACA 
versus 8.7 -14% for waitlist and usual care groups, respectively. We expect a higher response rate using the 
standard care comparison. However, even under the very conservative assumption that the response rate in our comparison arm is over four times as high as what was observed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602],
44, 46 our design 
has excellent power. For moderator analyses, 80% will be achieved for interaction terms that account for at least 6% of variance. As a result, we have identified ASD severity as the most salient and relevant potential  moderator of treatment outcomes. Calculations for the continuous outcome mixed models were 
performed in Hedeker’s RMASS2 software and calculations for the logistic mixed models were done via simulation in the R statistical package.  
Missi
ng Data and Attri tion:  Our primary analytic tool is GLMM, which provides unbiased parameter 
estimates when data are missing at random. GLMM estimates are based on maximum likelihood 
techniques and do not require imputation. Because the intermediate time points for subjects  who do not 
complete the full protocol provide information about their trajectory, we feel this is more appropriate 
than LOCF, which assumes a flat trajectory. However, we recognize that if dropout that is differentially

TAASD PROTOCOL  associated with outcomes in a way not captured by [CONTACT_803819] (i.e., non -ignorable rather 
than MCAR/MAR), this could compromise treatment comparisons. We will attempt to identify possible 
sampling biases by [CONTACT_803820]. If warranted, we will use imputation and propensity 
score approaches to handle bias problems. Every effort will be made to prevent dropouts/missing data, or 
to complete relevant assessments for patients who drop out.

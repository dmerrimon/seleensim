     Grant Title: The emergence of abstract structure knowledge across learning and sleep  NCT number: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Date: November 11, [ADDRESS_1261361] of our intervention by [CONTACT_899680] 2. Our planned sample size of N=100 results in statistical analyses with N=[ADDRESS_1261362] our expected effects. Aim 2 includes Stage 1, a delay, and Stage 2. Participants are assigned to different experimental conditions such that some particpants learn only Lattice categories in Stage 1 (Incongruent) while others are exposed to a Modular category (Congruent). Participants are also assigned to Awake or Sleep groups.  Categories in Stage 1 are paired with different auditory tones to be used later in TMR in the sleep groups. All participants learn a new Modular category in Stage 2. The Awake participants (Incongruent and Congruent) remain awake during the 2 hour delay between Stage 1 and 2.   Sleep participants are given a nap opportunity during the delay while sleep stages are monitored with EEG. For particpants who learned a Modular as well as a Lattice category in Phase 1, TMR will be used to selectively activate the Lattice (Incongruent) or Modular (Congruent) category. Participants in the Sleep Control group learned two Lattice categories in Phase [ADDRESS_1261363] of our intervention by [CONTACT_899681] 2 across groups. Accounting for an expected 20% attrition rate in the sleep groups, we plan to collect data from 173 participants, resulting in a final planned sample size of N=150. This results in statistical analyses with N=[ADDRESS_1261364] of interventions.  4.2.dStudy PhaseOtherOther4.2.eIntervention ModelParallel: Participants will either learn a Modular or a Lattice concept in Phase 1.Parallel: Participants will be assigned to either an Awake-Congruent, Awake-Incongruent, Sleep-Congruent, Sleep-Incongruent, or Sleep-Control group.

TypeAccuracyAccuracyTime FrameFinal accuracy is collected in a missing feature task which occurs 25 minutes after the experiment begins and takes 25 minutes to complete. Stage 1 and Stage 2 will take 50 minutes to complete. Final accuracy is collected in a missing feature task which occurs 2 hours and 50 minutes after the experiment begins and takes 25 minutes to complete. Stage 1, Stage 2, and the intervening delay period will take 3 hours and 15 minutes to complete. Brief DescriptionThe outcome measure is accuracy (0-100%) on the missing feature task in Stage 2.

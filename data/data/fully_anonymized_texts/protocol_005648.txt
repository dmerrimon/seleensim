TITLE  The Role of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_123787]  n/a 
NUMBER OF SITES  1 
  RATIONALE  As antibiotic resistance, antibiotic -related complica tions (e.g.

infections involving Class I and Class II  surgical wounds (as 
defined by [CONTACT_6750] , or Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention), including those associated with eyelid surgery, are 
known to be low.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a lack of evidence supporting the use of prophylactic

Rationale for Number  
of Subjects  We aim to recruit 200 people for each arm of the study, totaling 
400 subjects.  These numbers are commensurate to our regular 
surgical patient volume over the course of two years and as 
such, detected rates of infection will b e clinically relev ant.

Protocol Template © CFFT TDN   Effective: 12 SEP 2007  1 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a lack of evidence supporting the use of routine topi[INVESTIGATOR_123795] 
(e.g. poly -bacitracin , bacitracin, erythromycin, etc.) after eyelid surgery, it is 
currently standard of care to provide  patients with pos t-operative antibiotics in 
order to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs).  For instance, a  2014 survey of 
oculoplastic surgeons from 43 countries revealed that while rates of prophylactic 
oral and perioperative intravenous antibiotic us e varied considera bly, topi[INVESTIGATOR_123796] (85.2%).1  
The rates of postoperative infections involving Class I: Clean and Class II: Clean -
Contaminated*  surgical wounds, including those associated with eyelid surge ry, 
are known to b e low. For instance, while the rate of infection after blepharoplasty is 
0.2% with antibiotic ointment use  2 and the rate of infection after external 
dacrocystorhinostomy is 1% with antibiotic use,3 the rates of infection without 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_123797] a r ange of dermatological procedures such as Mohs surgery 
are as low as 0.7%.4 There is currently no literature on the rates of infection after 
blepharoplasty and other eyelid -specific procedures in the absence of prophylactic 
antibiotic oin tment.  
As antibio tic resistance, antibiotic -related complications (e.g. contact [CONTACT_8748]), 
and healthcare costs are on the rise, it has been advocated that topi[INVESTIGATOR_123798]. A s 
such, we propose  a randomized control trial testing the hypothesis that routine 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_123799]. The hope is to reduce rates of antibiotic resistance, antibiotic -
related complications,  and healthcare costs.  
*Under CDC surgical wound classification system, Class I/Clean wounds include 
“an uninfected operative wound in which no inflammation is encountered and…[is] 
primarily closed and, if necessary, drained with closed drainage…Class II/ Clean -
Contaminated wounds include those …without unusual contamination… [and] no 
evidence of infection or major break in technique.”

Total duration of subject participation will be from the time of approval for eyelid 
surgery to post -operative visit #1 (either one or two weeks after surgery). Total 
durati on of the study is  expected to be 2 years.  
4 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION  
4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be the rate of superficial incisional and deep incisional 
surgical site infection (SSI) of clean and clean -contaminated wounds at

10 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DO CUMENTATION  
10.1 Advers e Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
investigation of a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE is theref ore any 
unfavorabl e and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product.  An 
unexpected AE is  one of a type not  identified in nature, severity, or frequency in 
the current Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity or frequency than 
expected based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The Investigator will probe, via discussion wi th the subject, fo r the occurrence of 
AEs during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source 
documents.  Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events

(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, includin g 
laboratory abnor malities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can 
be found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified 
criteria, the guidelines shown in Table 1 below should be used  to grade severity.  It 
should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a 
severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no 
medical intervention or therapy required. The subject may 
be aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it 
reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or min imal 
medical inter vention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse 
experience as it occurred. Thi s does not refer t o an 
experience that hypothetically might have caused death if 
it were more severe.  
 
AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following 
the guidelines in Table 2. 
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  
to Drug  Comment  
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a 
reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the dr ug; that 
follows a  known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; 
that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and 
that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846].

Protocol Template © CFFT TDN   Effective: 12 SEP 2007  Probably  An event that follows a reasonable tempor al sequence from 
administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_123807]; and that is unlikely to be explained by 
[CONTACT_123812]’s clinica l state or by [CONTACT_41847].  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to that suspected drug; but that could readily have been 
produced by a numb er of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship 
to the study drug.  
10.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• death 
• a life -threatening adverse experience  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also b e considered an SA E when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
 
10.2.1  Serious Adverse Experience Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not  related to study drug) 
per UCSF CHR Guidelines .  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after 
informed consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have 
been completed.  
In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site 
investigator will report SAEs to the IRB/IEC.   
10.3 Medical Moni toring  
The DSMC wi ll receive regular updates, including information such as: number of 
patients screened, number of participants enrolled, number of participants 
randomized/receiving treatment, number of participants lost to follow -up, number of 
participan ts meeting the out come definition, and number of participants with an 
adverse event. These updates will be made after each consecutive set of 25

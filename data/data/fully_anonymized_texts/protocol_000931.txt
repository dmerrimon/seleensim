Protocol Title:   Open -Label, Single Arm, Phase 3b, Multi -Center Study Evaluating the Efficacy of 
Venetoclax (ABT -199) in Relapsed/Refractory Subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) 
(VENICE I)
Objectives:   
Prim ary Objective:   The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax 
monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  The primary 
efficacy endpoint will be measured by [CONTACT_878907] ( Com plete Rem ission Rate [CR] and 
Com plete Remission with Incomplete Marrow Recovery [CRi]; CR + CRi) as assessed by [CONTACT_1275], of the subjects who have not been previously treated w ith B -cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi) 
therapy.
Secondary Objectives:   The secondary objectives are to evaluate other efficacy parameters including the 
overall response rate (ORR), duration of overall response (DoR), time to progression (TTP), 
progression -free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the CR rate in BCRi treated subjec ts.  In 
addition, quality of life will be assessed using the following patient reported outcome (PRO) 
questionnaires:  the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D-5L) questionnaire, a measure of general health 
status, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Leuk emia Questionnaire (FACT -Leu), a 
leukemia -specific health related quality of life for acute and chronic disease, and the Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue Scale (FACIT -F).
The safety and tolerability of venetoclax in subjects w ith re lapsed/refractory CLL will also be evaluated.
Exploratory Objectives:   The exploratory objectives are to evaluate the level of Minimal Residual 
Disease (MRD) and the rate of MRD negativity in the peripheral blood.  
Investigators:   Multi- center
Study Sit es:  Approximately 7 sites in the [LOCATION_002] and approximately 67 sites globally.
Study Population:   Subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL with or without the 17p deletion or 
TP53 mutation, including subjects with an unknown status, as w ell as R/R CLL subjects who have been 
previously treated with B -cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi) therapy.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 250 subjects

Methodology:   
This is a Phase 3b, single arm, open -label, multi -center study evaluating the efficacy of venetoclax in 
subjects with R/R CLL.  All screening procedures must be performed within [ADDRESS_1227794] computed tomography (CT) scan (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] 
if a CT w ith contrast is medically contraindicated) w ill be accepted if previously performed w ithin 
35days prior to study drug adm inistration, otherwise a CT scan (or MRI) must be performed w ithin the 
screening period of [ADDRESS_1227795] and second day of Week 1 and Week 2 
during the dose titration phase.  Beginning on Week 3, through Week 5, study visits will be conducted 
within 72 hours of dosing and on Day 1 of each week.  Additional study visits on Day 2 of each week 
should be performed for subjects who continue to be at risk for TLS, based on investigator assessment.  
Study visits will be reduced to a monthly frequency at Week 8, and at Week 48, they will be reduced to 
every 3 months until the end of study treatment (Week 108).  In countries where venetoclax is not 
commercially available, subjects who continue to derive benefit after [ADDRESS_1227796] in the extended access phase of this study 
continues to derive benefit from Venetoclax after the 2 -year extension, then per PI 's assessment, subjects 
who are transferring to the venetoclax extension study, Study M19 -388, may r emain in Extended Access 
for up to additional [ADDRESS_1227797] assessments will be 
performed by [CONTACT_878908] 1 Day 1 (baseline), Week 24 and Week 48.  
When confirming a CR or CRi status per 2008 Modified International Workshop for Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia National Cancer Institute Wo rking Group (IWCLL NCI WG) criteria w ith a 
bone marrow  (BM) biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], MRD assessment of the BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_878874].  
After treatment discontinuation, a final visit will be performed.  Subjects w ill be followed for disease 
progressi on (if progression has not already occurred) and survival.  Post -treatment follow -up calls will be 
performed every 6 months until discontinuation from the study.  Survival information (i.e., the date and 
cause of death, post -treatment cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], dat e of progression etc.) will be collected.  This period 
will continue for 2 years following discontinuation of venetoclax.
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data intermittently according to the DMC 
charter.  Subsequent revie ws may be co nducted based on recommendations from the DMC or requests 
from the Sponsor.  Details of the DMC review will be presented in the DMC charter.

Duration of Treatm ent:  Subjects may continue receiving venetoclax for up to [ADDRESS_1227799] no evidence of disease progression (based on investigator assessment), 
do not have unacceptable toxicity and do not meet any of th e criteria for subject discontinuation.  After 
treatment discontinuation, subjects w ill be followed for disease progression (if progression has not 
already occurred) and survival.  Post -treatment calls will be performed every 6 months until 
discontinuation from the study.  Survival information (i.e., the date and cause of death, post -treatment 
cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], date of progression etc.) will be collected.  This period w ill continue for [ADDRESS_1227800] in the 
extended access phase of this study continues to derive benefi t after the 2 -year extension and venetoclax 
is still not commercially available in their country, they may continue their treatment for 1 additional 
year.  Per PI's assessment, subjects w ho are unable to transfer to the venetoclax extension study, Study 
M19-388, may remain in Extended Access for the additional 1 year or until the extension study is 
approved and initiated at the site, whichever is sooner.  [COMPANY_013] will work with the investigator on a case 
by [CONTACT_878909] o f venetoclax therapy.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Disease response will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], based on laboratory results and physical 
examinations using the [ADDRESS_1227801] 
imaging and bone marrow  biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_878876] (or MRI in 
the case CT is medically contraindicated).
All measurable disease must be documented at Screening by [CONTACT_5292], laboratory testing, 
and CT scan (or MRI i n the case CT is medically contraindicated).  During the study, clinical disease 
assessments will take place at Week 24, Week 36, and Week 48.  To confirm the response, a CT scan w ill 
be performed at Week 48.
Minim al Residual Disease (MRD):
A peripheral b lood specimen will be collected from all subjects at Week 1 Day 1 (baseline), Week 24 and 
Week 48 to determine the level of minimal residual disease.  When confirming a CR/CRi status per [ADDRESS_1227802] 
negativity in the 2008 Modified IWCLLNCI -WG criteria is defined as the presence of less than one CLL 
cell per 10,000 leukocytes ( or below  10–4).
Pharm acokinetics:
A single pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sample w ill be collected from each subject and analyzed for plasma 
venetoclax concentration.
Safety:
Adverse event monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, and laboratory assessments will be 
evaluated.
The study analyses will be descriptive.  All subjects participating in the study who received at least 
onedose of venetoclax will be included in the analyses unless otherwise noted in the separate, statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy:
The follow ing efficacy endpoints will be analyzed:  Complete Remission rate (CR + CRi), Overall 
Response Rate (ORR), Duration of Overall Response (DOR), Duration of Progression -Free Survival 
(PFS) and Over all Survival (OS):
Com plete Remission Rate (CR) and Complete Remission with Incomplete Marrow  Recovery (CRi)
Defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a CR or CRi (all subjects and previously BCRi 
treated subjects).
Overall Response Rate (ORR)
Defined as the proportion of subjects w ith an overall response (complete remission plus partial 
remission).
Duration of Response (DOR)
Defined as the number of days from the date of first response (per the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI -WG 
criteria) to the date of d isease progression.  All disease progression will be included regardless whether 
the event occurred while the subject w as taking venetoclax or had previously discontinued venetoclax.
Time to Progression (TTP)
Defined as the number of days from the date of first dose of venetoclax to date of disease progression.  
All disease progression will be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject w as 
taking venetoclax or had previously discontinued venetoclax.
Duration of Progression -Free Surviva l (PFS)
Defined as the number of days from the date of first dose of venetoclax to the date of disease progression 
or death, w hichever occurs first.  All disease progression will be included regardless whether the event 
occurred w hile the subject w as takin g venetoclax or had previously discontinued venetoclax.
Overall Survival (OS)
Defined as number of days from the date of first dose of venetoclax to the date of death.
Additional Exploratory Analyses Include:
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Level and Negativity Status: 
The level of MRD and the rate of MRD negativity will be assessed in the peripheral blood of all subjects 
at Week 1 Day 1 (baseline), Week [ADDRESS_1227803] negativity will be defined as less t han 
oneCLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (or below  10–4).  Additionally, bone marrow  samples collected from 
subjects achieving CR/CRi will also be assessed for both the level of MRD and the rate of MRD 
negativity.  Rate of MRD status will be defined as the proportion of subjects who have MRD negativity 
status.  Ninety -five percent (95%) confidence intervals based on the binomial distribution will be 
provided.  The relationship between venetoclax PK and efficacy parameters including MRD level and CR 
will be evaluated.
Pharm acokinetics:
An analysis of venetoclax plasma concentrations will be performed using a population PK modeling 
approach.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Health Econom ic and Patient Reported Outcom e (PRO) Measures:
Quality of life will be assessed by [CONTACT_878910]:  the EQ -5D-5L, FACT -Leu, and the 
FACIT -F.
Quality of life endpoints will be summarized based on the scoring manuals for the instrument.  
Sample Size Estimation:
Using the CR rate of 6% reported for current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] * 250 subjects w ould provide approximately 90% 
power (based on an exact test for single proportions using a tw o-sided alpha of 5%) to reject the null 
hypothesis of 6% in favor of an alternative hypothesis that the CR rate for venetoclax monotherapy is 
12% (doubling of the CR rate).
In order to provide approximately 80% pow er (based on an exact test for single proportions using a 
two-sided alpha of 5%) to reject the null hypothesis of 6% CR rate in favor of an alternative hypothesis 
that the CR rate for vene toclax monotherapy is 12% (doubling of the CR rate), the study will enroll 
190subjects who have not been previously treated with BCRi therapy.  Since there are approximately a 
total of 250 subjects, up to 60 subjects previously treated with BCRi therapy c an be enrolled. 
Safety:
A safety analysis will be performed for all subjects participating in the study who took at least one dose 
of study drug.  For the study as a whole, adverse events will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory 
test results and vit al signs will be explored for trends and summarized.

3.0 Introduction
Bcl-2 Family Proteins
The B -cell l ymphoma -2 (Bcl- 2) famil y proteins are important regulators of the intrinsic 
apoptosis pathway .  The Bcl -[ADDRESS_1227813] identified in follicular lymphoma (FL) 
where the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation results in significant over -expression of the 
protein in B -cells.  The Bcl- 2 famil y of genes encodes a famil y of closely related proteins 
that possess either pro -apoptotic or anti -apoptotic activity  and share up to four Bcl -2 
Homology  (BH) domains.1-4  Bcl -2 overexpression is a major con tributor to the 
pathogenesis of some t ypes of ly mphoid malignancies.  Bcl -2 is also overexpressed in 
acute and chronic leukemias.  Chronic ly mphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a genetic disease 
where the microRNAs miR15a and miR16 -1 that negativel y regulate the t ranscription of 
Bcl-2 are deleted or down -regulated, resulting in uncontrolled expression of Bcl- 2.5,6
Venetoclax (ABT -199) 
Venetoclax, also known as ABT -199, is a novel, orally  bioavailable, small molecule Bcl -2 
family  protein inhibitor that binds with high affinity  (Ki < 0.010 nM) to antiapoptotic 
Bcl-2 and with lower affinity  to other antiapoptotic Bcl -2 famil y proteins like B -cell 
lymphoma -extra large (Bcl-X L) and B -cell ly mphoma -Walter and Eliza Hall I nstitute 
(Bcl-w) (> 4,000 -fold and > –2,000- to > 20,000- fold lower affinit y than to Bcl -2, 
respectivel y).8  Selective inhibition by  [CONTACT_700386] -2 signaling and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y 
induces multiple hallmarks of apoptotic cell death in Bcl -2
-dependent human tumor cell 
lines.8  Importantly , venetoclax inhibition of Bcl -2 is independent of p53 activity .

subjects are included in overall pooled analyses for reporting Reference Safety 
Information.  The 2473 subjects in the overall pooled anal ysis include 2224 oncology  
subjects (987 in monotherap y studies and 1237 in combination therap y studie s), 
153healthy  volunteers, 23 subjects with hepatic impairment and 73 subjects with SL E.  
Of the 2224 oncology  subjects, 1132 subjects had CLL/small ly mphocy tic ly mphoma 
(SLL), 569 subjects had Non -Hodgkin's Ly mphoma (NHL), 172 subjects had multiple 
myeloma (MM), 340 had Acute M yeloid Leukemia (AML), and 11 subjects had 
myelodysplastic s yndrome (MDS).  [ADDRESS_1227815] common adverse events reported in venetoclax monotherapy studies were 
neutropenia (39.3%), nausea (31.4%) and diarrhea (24.9%).  The most common adve rse 
events that were grade 3 and above were neutropenia (34.9%), anemia (13.8%) and 
thrombocy topenia (12.8%).  The most common serious adverse events were febrile 
neutropenia (6.1%), pneumonia (5.4%), malignant neoplasm progression (3.4%), and 
pyrexia (3.3 %).  
Tumor ly sis sy ndrome (TLS) is an important risk, particularl y in subjects with R/R CLL.  
As a result of on -target effects, the potential for TLS with venetoclax was identified early  
in the program when the initial 3 subjects with CLL/SLL received sta rting doses of 
100mg or 200 mg and experienced TLS, which was reported as an adverse event for 
each.  Subsequently , 2 fatal events in the setting of TL S and another event of clinical TL S 
in subjects with CLL /SLL occurred in December 2012.  After comprehen sive review of 
all safet y data available from studies with venetoclax, a revised dosing regimen with a 
dose-titration phase of 5 weeks and enhanced TLS prophy laxis and monitoring measures 
were implemented in all CLL studies.  A subsequent anal ysis of data from subjects with 
CLL/SLL following the implementation of proph ylaxis measures, who completed 
monotherap y indicated a marked reduction in severity and frequency of TLS when 
compared to the previous anal ysis.  None of the subjects experienced an y serious

20
(including fatal) or nonserious event of clinical TLS (CTL S) or laboratory  TLS (LTLS) or 
had study  treatment discontinued because of TLS.  Since May  2014, a more personalized 
approach for proph ylaxis and monitoring measures, where subjects with lower tumor 
burden could receive venetoclax on an out -patient basis, has been evaluated with no cases 
of clinical TL S.  Overall, the clinical data strongl y support that the risk of TLS with 
venetoclax in CLL/SLL subjects is highest when initiating venetoclax dosing (5 -week 
dose titration phase), as well as being greater in subjects with a large tumor burden.
The safet y profile in combination studies is consistent with that observed in monotherap y 
studies and with known toxicity  profile of combination agents.  Prelimina ry efficacy  data 
indicate that venetoclax, both as monotherap y and in combination with other therapeutic 
agents, continues to show promising efficacy in oncology subject populations.  The 
overall response rate (ORR) in subjects with CLL/SLL was 75.0% to 81 .7% (dose 
escalation and safet y expansion cohorts, respectively), with a complete remission rate (CR 
+ CRi) of 32.1% in dose escalation and 11.7% in the safet y expansion cohort for 
venetoclax monotherap y (Study  M12 -175 as of 10 June 2016).9
Additional safet y and efficacy data are described in detail in the I nvestigator Brochure.8
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
Chronic ly mphocy tic leukemia is a ly mphoproliferative disorder, charact erized by  
[CONTACT_878911], small, mature -appearing CD5+ B cells in 
peripheral blood, bone marrow, and secondary l ymphoid organs.  It is the most common 
form of leukemia in adults in the Western World, accounting for approximately 30% of all 
leukemias.10  Chronic ly mphocy tic leukemia primarily  affects elderl y individuals; 
however , approximately  one third of subjects are less than [ADDRESS_1227816] 4,500 individuals will die of the disease.12  In 
Europe, CLL accounts for approximately  30% of all leukemias in adults with a reported 
age standardized incidence rate of 3.79 per 100,000 individuals (for CLL/SLL) in the 
years 2000 –2002.10,13  The approximate 5- year survival rate for subjects with CLL is

73%.[ADDRESS_1227817] not 
consistently  offered survival advantage.  Treatment decisions for subjects with CLL are 
made on the basis of considerations such as age, clinical stage, expected survival, and 
anticipated toxicities.  With the notable exception o f allogeneic stem cell transplantation, 
CLL is currentl y an incurable disease, despi[INVESTIGATOR_841676] .  Nonetheless, globally  access to allogeneic stem cell transplant and/or 
clinical trials is limited, and treatment options for relapsed disease tend to have increased 
toxicity  and reduced antitumor activity .
Chromosome 17p Deletions and TP53 Gene Mutations in Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia
Chromosome 17p deletions and TP53 gene mutations are among a group of genetic 
defects that occur in subsets of subjects with CLL in addition to defects causing Bcl- 2 
dysregulation.  The short arm of chromosome 17 contains the TP53 gene that encodes 
tumor protein p53, a tumor suppressor involved in deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) repair 
activation, cell cy cling regulation, and apoptosis signaling.  Standard cy totoxic 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_878877] (i.e., fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and 
bendamustine), act by  [CONTACT_878912].  The p53 tumor 
suppressor is ess ential for relay ing the DNA damage signal to the apoptotic machinery .  
When p53 is functionally inactivated, either through mutation or deletion, these signals

22
are not effectively  relay ed and the efficacy  of these agents is diminished.  Chromosome 
17p dele tions and TP53 mutations occur over the course of the disease and expand under 
treatment selection pressure as a result of the resistance to chemotherap y and 
chemoimmunotherap y they confer.16-18  Notably , over 80% of subjects with 17p deletions 
also carry  a TP53 mutation.17,19
The decreased likelihood of subj ects with 17p deletions and/or TP53 mutations 
responding to standard chemotherap y and chemoimmunotherapy regimens is 
accompanied by a greater risk of disease progression and a shorter overall survival 
(OS).7,16-18,20  In a long -term follow up study  of the effects of 17p deletions/TP53 
mutations in CLL subjects treated according to standard practice outside of a clinical 
study , survival periods measured from date of study sampling were 7.6 months or less for 
subjects with 17p deletions and/or TP53 mutations compared to [ADDRESS_1227818] also been demonstrated in large

of CLL subjects with 17p deletion (ibrutinib, idelalisib) or TP53 mutations (idelalisib 
only).  Ibrutinib inhibits Bruton's t yrosine kinase, an enzyme involved i n B-cell receptor 
signaling, homing, and adhesion.  A Phase 3 relapsed or refractory  CLL study  comparing 
ofatumumab (an anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody ) to ibrutinib included 127 subjects with 
the 17p deletion.  In this cohort, the median duration of PFS was 5.8 months in the 
ofatumumab arm but was not reached in the ibrutinib arm (HR 0.25; 95% CI :  0.14, 0.45).  
The overall response rate was 47.6% with ibrutinib compared with 4.7% with 
ofatumumab.  No complete responses were observed.25  Overall, 57% of subjects in the 
ibrutinib arm had at least one ≥ Grade 3 adverse event (AE).  The most frequent 
non-
hematologic AEs (> 20% of subjects) with ibrutinib were diarrhea, fatigue, p yrexia, 
and nausea.26  Gra de 3/4 AEs reported in 
≥ 5% of the 357 subjects with mantle cell 
lymphoma or CLL that received ibrutinib during clinical development were anemia, 
neutropenia, pneumonia and thrombocy topenia.27
Idelalisib targets the delta isoform of phosphatid ylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3Kδ) involved in 
signal transduction via multiple receptors including the B -cell receptor a nd chemokine 
receptors CXCR4 and CXCR5.  A Phase 3 study  comparing combined 
idelalisib/rituximab treatment with rituximab/placebo in previously treated subjects 
reported improved PFS in the idelalisib arm among the 96 subjects enrolled with 
17pdeletion or TP53 mutation (HR 0.12; CI :  0.05, 0.32).  The majorit y of AEs in the

nausea, chills, and diarrhea.28  The overall safety profile determined in Phase 1 to 3 
studies of idelalisib in hematologic malignancies as monotherap y or in combination with 
an anti -CD20 monoclonal ant ibody  is characterized by  a very  common frequency

However, the mechanism of action of venetoclax is independent of the B -cell receptor 
(BCR) pathway .32  Briefly, venetoclax inhibits Bcl -2 allowing the release of BIM, which 
includes oligomerization of pro- apoptotic molecules such as BAK and BAX which 
triggers rapid apoptosis.  The clinical data to date with venetoclax monotherap y shows 
strong activity  in refractory  CLL indicating that it might be beneficial in a population that 
is refractory  to these newer therapeutic agents.

4.0 Study  Objective
The primary  objecti ve of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy  of venetoclax monotherapy  
in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic l ymphocy tic leukemia (CLL).  The primary  
efficacy  endpoint will be measured b y complete remission rate (CR + CRi) of the subjects 
who hav e not been previously  treated with BCRi therap y, as assessed b y the investigator.
The secondary  objectives are to evaluate other efficacy parameters including the overall 
response rate (ORR), duration of overall response (DoR), time to progression (TTP), 
progression -free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the CR rate in previously  
BCRi treated subjects. 
Additional secondary  objectives will also be evaluated, as well.  Quality  of life will be 
assessed using the following patient reported outcomes (P RO) questionnaires:  the 
EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D-5L), a measure of general health status, the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therap y –Leukemia Questionnaire (FACT
-Leu), a leukemia -
specific health related quality  of life for acute and chronic disease, and the Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therap y-Fatigue Scale (FACIT- F). 
The safet y and tolerability of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL will 
also be evaluated.
Additional exploratory  objectives will be evaluated.  Minimal Res idual Disease (MRD) 
will be assessed in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) b y flow cytometry  and 
PCR.

This study  is designed to enroll approximately  250 subjects to meet scientific objectives 
without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  
All efforts will be made to adhere to these specific enrollment numbers; however, it would 
not be ethical to den y treatment to eligible subjects already in screening as they may have 
undergone stud y related procedures.
Subjects in this study  will be enrolled at approximate ly [ADDRESS_1227828] computed tomograph y (CT) scan (or medicall y

the dose titration phase.  Beginning on Week 3, through Week 5, study  visits will be 
conducted within 72 hours of dosing an d on Day  1 of each week.  Additional study  visits 
on Day  2 of each week should be performed for subjects who continue to be at risk for 
TLS, based on investigator assessment.  Study  visits will be reduced to a monthly  
frequency  at Week 8, and at Week 48, t hey will be reduced to every  3 months until the 
end of study  treatment (Week 108).  As of Week 8, the visit window for scheduled visits 
is ± 2 day s.  A 30 day  Safety  Follow -up Visit should be performed approximately  30 day s 
(± 3 day s) following the last do se of venetoclax (to allow for AE collection [ADDRESS_1227831] dose of study
 drug).  If a subject is discontinued from the study  with an 
ongoing AE or an unresolved clinically significant laboratory result, the site will attempt 
to provide follow -up until the AE has resolved to a ≤ Grade 1 or baseline or it is the 
investigator's judgment that the event is unlikely to resolve.
Venetoclax will be administered orall y once dail y (QD), continuousl y.  Venetoclax tablets 
should be taken with a meal and water in the morning at approximately  the same time 
each day .  To mitigate the risk for TLS, the first 5 weeks of treatment include a dose -

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
All study  procedures outlined in Appendix Dand Appendix Eare discussed in detail in 
this section, with the exception of adverse event (A E) information (discussed in 
Section 6.1.1).  All study data will be recorded on electronic case report forms (eCRFs).
Informed Consent
Subjects must voluntarily  sign and date an informed consent form approved by  [CONTACT_878914]/IRB, prior to the initiation of any screening, study -specific procedures, or before an y 
prohibited medications are withheld from the subject in order to participate in the study.  
Details about how in formed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in 
Section 9.3.
Screening
Procedures performed at Screening will serve as baseline, unle ss repeated on Week 1 
Day 1 prior to dosing; in which case the latter will serve as baseline.  An y abnormal 
laboratory  or vital sign assessment between screening and prior to administration of study  
drug will be recorded in the subject's medical history  and will also serve as the subject's 
baseline.  The schedule of study  visit procedures is based on subject stud y drug 
administration.  Scheduled study  visits and/or procedures will need to be altered if there is 
an interruption in study  drug administration. If study drug administration is interrupted 
for more than 3 day s (i.e., adverse event), the site will contact [CONTACT_878915]'s visit schedule, procedures and/or dosing on a case 
by [CONTACT_413].
Subjects who sign ed informed consent, have had at least one study  procedure conducted, 
and are determined to be a screen failure, will not proceed in stud y.
Re-Screening Procedures
Subjects that initially  screen fail for the study  may  be permitted to re -screen following re -
consent.  All Screening procedures will need to be repeated.  The subject must meet all

●During the study  a urine pregnancy  test can be perf ormed at the discretion of 
the investigator or per local guidelines.
●Females of non -childbearing potential (either postmenopausal or permanently  
surgically sterile as defined in Inclusion Criteri on9) at Screening do not 
require pregnancy  testing.
Adverse Event and Concomitant Medication Assessment
On Week 1 Day  1, an y protocol- related events observed from the time of signing of the 
informed consent but prior to initial venetoclax administration will be recorded as a 
serious or nonserious adverse event, if considered by  [CONTACT_878916] y 
related to the stud y-required procedures (See Figure 3). 
At each visit, including the Final Visit and t he Post- Treatment Follow -Up, the subject's 
medical history  will be reviewed and any  changes from baseline will be recorded on the 
adverse event eCRF.
If a subject reports taking any over -the-counter or prescription medications, vitamins 
and/or herbal suppl ements or if administration of any  medication becomes necessary  
beginning with Screening through the end of the study , the name [CONTACT_11889], 
dosage information including dose, route and frequency, date(s) of administration 
including start and end dat es, and reason for use must be recorded on the appropriate

Vital Signs
Vital signs include bod y temperature (oral or ty mpanic), weight, blood pressure and pulse.  
On day s when venetoclax is administered in the clinic, blood pressure and pulse rate will 
be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 5 minutes.
NOTE:   Starting with visit Week 8/Day  1, vital signs may  be performed within [ADDRESS_1227864] should hav e a complete physical examination , including height 
and weight (height onl y performed during Screening).  A complete ph ysical examination 
should include the evaluation of head, eyes, ears, nose and throat (HEENT); 
cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoske letal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , gastrointestinal and 
neurological s ystems. 
A symptom directed physical examination may be performed at all other visits (other 
than screening) and should be limited to sy stems of primary  relevance:  cardiovascular, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , and tho se associated with sy mptoms.
Physical Examination (Disease Assessment)
Physical examinations performed as a part of Disease Assessments (Screening, Weeks 24, 
36, 48) are to include the evaluation of the presence and degree of enlarged lymph nodes 
in two di mension (cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal and femoral nodes), 
hepatomegal y, and splenomegaly.  These l ymph node evaluations should be noted on all 
physical examinations irrespective of being present or absent.  Refer to Disease 
Assessments (20 08 Modified I WCLL NCI -WG Criteria) for additional information 
pertaining to methods of measurement.
Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded at each subsequent phy sical 
examination.  New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs if appropriate.

If signs or symptoms suggestive of Richter's S yndrome are observed during ph ysical 
examination, further assessments (i.e., nodes, Positron Emission Tomography [PET] scan) 
should be considered to exclude or confirm the transformation. 
Please refer to Appendix Dand Appendix Efor timing of all ph ysical examinations.  
NOTE:   Starting with Week 8 Day  1, all Phy sical examinations may  be performed within 
72 hours before or after the scheduled visit.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) Risk Assessment
At Screening, all stud y subjects will be assessed fo r risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_237422].  The risk of 
TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, including tumor burden and comorbidities.  
Subjects with high tumor burden (e.g., an y lymph node with a diameter ≥ 5 cm or high 
absolute ly mphocy te count [AL C] [AL C ≥ 25 × 109/L]) are at greater risk of TL S.  
Reduced renal function (estimated creatinine clearance [eCrCl] < 80 mL /min) further 
increases the risk.  The risk may decrease as tumor burden decreases with venetoclax 
treatment.
Tumor burden assessments, including radiographic evaluation (e.g., CT scans) as well as 
chemistry /hematology  assessments (refer to Table 4, Clinical L aboratory  Tests) will be 
performed in all subjects prior to initiating venetoclax treatment.
Appropriate venetoclax dosing and management of subjects throughout their study 
treatment is guided b y their individual risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_237422].  Risk -based TL S 
prophy laxis and management measures are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

All measurable disease must be documented at Screening (baseline), prior to the first dose 
of venetoclax, for all subjects based on the a nalysis of clinical laboratory  tests 
(hematology ), disease assessment phy sical examination, contrast -enhanced CT scan of 
involved neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis (or MRI, if CT scan with contrast is medically 
contraindicated).  Bone marrow examinations at screening are not required but results will 
be recorded if available. 
For all subjects, clinical response will be assessed by [CONTACT_211675] 24, 
Week [ADDRESS_1227871] scan (or MRI, if CT scan with contrast is medically 
contraindicated) will be performed at Week [ADDRESS_1227872] imaging (or MRI).

For determination of complete remission (CR), the CT scan and bone marrow are required 
to be negative, per the IWCLL NC I-WG criteria.  I t is recommended that the CT scan is 
performed first; if it does confirm a clinical response, then a bone marrow biopsy will be 
obtained.  If a CT scan is performed and does not confirm a clinical response, a bone 
marrow biops y should not be obtained.
If a subject exhibits clinical si gns of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or 
denovo enlargement of liver, spleen or l ymph nodes on phy sical examination) without an 
increase in ly mphocy tes meeting the progression of disease criteria, then additional 
assessments including contr ast-enhanced CT scan and/or bone marrow can be performed 
to confirm or rule out disease progression. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
For an y subject who has not experienced progressive disease (PD) at the time of 
permanent discontinuation of venetoclax, follow -up phone calls will continue until death, 
discontinuation from the study  or upon stud y completion.
Response criteria definition s are outlined in [ADDRESS_1227873] and a bone marrow 
examination can be done between Week 48 and Week 108 to confirm CR if there is a 
possibility  that a patient is in Complete Remission based on laboratory  tests and a disease 
assessment phy sical examination.
NOTE:   Disease assessments ma y be performed approximately  7 day s prior to the 
scheduled visit.

30-Day Safety Visit
A 30 -Day Safet y Follow -up Visit should be performed approximately  30 day s (± 3 days) 
following the last dose of venetoclax (to allow for AE collection [ADDRESS_1227879] 
dose of study  drug).  Refer to Appendix Dand Appendix Efor procedures to be 
performed.  
If a subject has an ongoing AE or an unresolved clinically  significant laboratory  result 
30days following last dose of study  drug, the site will attempt to provide follow -up until 
the AE has resolved to a ≤ Grade 1 or ba seline or it is the investigator's judgment that the 
event is unlikely  to resolve.  
Additionally , CT or MRI scans are not required, however if collected b y the site as 
standard of care, the data should be recorded in EDC.
Post-Treatment and Survival Asses sments 
After treatment discontinuation, subjects will be followed for disease progression (if 
progression has not already  occurred) and survival.  Post -treatment calls will be 
performed every  6 months until discontinuation from the study .  Survival inform ation 
(i.e., the date and cause of death, post -treatment cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], date of progression etc.)

5.3.3 Efficacy  Variables
The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy  of venetoclax monothe rapy 
in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic l ymphocy tic leukemia (CLL).  The primary  
efficacy  endpoint will be measured b y complete remission rate (CR + CRi) of the subjects 
who have not been previously  treated with B -cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi ) therap y, as 
assessed b y the investigator.
The secondary  objectives are to evaluate other efficacy parameters including the overall 
response rate (ORR), duration of overall response (DoR), time to progression, (TTP), 
progression -free survival (PFS), overa ll survival (OS), and the CR rate in BCRi treated 
subjects.
Additional secondary  objectives will be evaluated.  Health Economic and 
Patient -Reported Outcome Measures will include the EQ -5D-5L, the FACT- Leu and the 
FACIT -F.  Minimal residual disease (MRD) a nd the rate of MRD negativity  in the 
peripheral blood are assessed as exploratory  objectives in the peripheral blood and bone 
marrow (BM) b y flow cytometry , PCR and/or sequencing.
Analy ses of these endpoints are described in Section 8.0.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Variables
For disease assessments, response will be assessed by  [CONTACT_841741] (hematology  laboratory values) , disease assessment phy sical 
examination, CT scan including neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis (or MRI if CT with 
contrast is medicall y contraindicated); bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_878889].  Subjects will be evaluated against the 2008 Modified  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)
M15 -550 Protocol Amendment [IP_ADDRESS].01 (ROW)
EudraCT [ADDRESS_1227883] imaging (or MRI). A BM 
sample assessment is required to confirm CR.
At screening (baseline), all measurable disease must be documented b y laboratory testing 
(hematologic status), ph ysical examination, and CT scan.  All baseline evaluations should 
be performed as closely  aspossible to the beginning of treatment and not more than 
4weeks before the beginning of the treatment with the exception of the CT scan (or MRI) 
which will be accepted if previously performed within [ADDRESS_1227884] scan will be performed at Week 48 on all 
subjects.  For subjects with CR as response at Week 48, a BM sample is required to 
confirm the response.  
Methods of Measurement
Disease response and progression will be assessed by  [CONTACT_147560], clinical 
examination, radiographic scans and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_111779] y.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to c haracterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.
Details on the anal ysis of peripheral blood required to assess response are provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
A full disease assessment phy sical examination should be performed to assess the extent 
of disease involvement.  Phy sical examinations should include the evaluation of the 
presence and degree of enlarged l ymph nodes in two dimension (cervical, supraclavicular, 
axillary , inguinal and femoral nodes), hepatomegaly , and splenomegal y.  These should be 
noted on all examinations irrespective of being present or absent.  All measurements 
should be taken and recorded in metri c notation using a ruler or calipers.  Clinical lesions 
will only  be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., palpable ly mph 
nodes).  The diameter, in two planes, of the largest palpable nodes in each of the

following sites should be measured:  cervical, supraclavicular, axillary , inguinal, and 
femoral.  The presence of hepatomegal y and splenomegaly  should be performed.
The [ADDRESS_1227885] bi -dimensional lesions should be recorded in the eCRF.  
●Target Lesions:  A maximum of 12 target lesions may b e selected (up to 
6nodal and 6 extra nodal).  Target nodal lesions must be abnormal (> 1.5 cm 
in LDi [Longest Diameter] at baseline), clearly measurable and suitable for 
consistent, reproducible measurement in at least two perpendicular 
dimensions.  Targe t extra nodal lesions must be > 1 cm in two perpendicular 
diameters at baseline.
● Non- Target Lesions:  Sites will be classified as non -target lesions where 
disease is present but not selected for target lesions.  A maximum of 
[ADDRESS_1227886] be 
abnormal (> 1.5 cm in LDi at baseline).  Non -target extra nodal lesions must 
be > 1 cm in two perpendicular diameters.  Nodal and extra nodal lesio ns that 
were not selected as target lesions at baseline can be foll owed as non- target 
lesions.
Computed tomograph y (CT) is the preferred method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment.  CT scans (with contrast) should include neck, chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis scans.  CT scans for response assessment may  be limited to areas of prior 
involvement only , if required by  [CONTACT_841743].  A contrast -enhanced MRI of 
the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis with a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may  be used 
if CT with contrast is medically  contraindicated ( e.g., severe contrast allergy ).  If MRIs 
are used instead of CT scans, MRI s should be used consistently  throughout the study .  
Conventional CT and MRI  should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_1227887] should be perfo rmed by  [CONTACT_2363] 5 mm contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm; this specification applies to the regions of the neck, chest, 
abdomen and pelvis at baseline and follow -ups.  The [ADDRESS_1227888] bi -dimensional lesions 
should be recorded in the eCRF (6 nodal and 6 extra nodal).

The FACT -Leu is a [ADDRESS_1227899] 
health- related quality  of life (HRQoL) and leukemia -specific s ymptoms using a 'core' set 
of questions (Fu nctional Assessment of Cancer Therap y-General; FACT- G), as well as a 
cancer site -specific leukemia subscale.[ADDRESS_1227900] -G is a 27 -item compi[INVESTIGATOR_878891] a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 = "not at all" to 4 = "very  
much."35  The items are divided into 4 primary HRQOL  domains:  Phy sical Well -being 
(7items; score range, 0 –28), Social/Family  Well -being (7 items; score range, 0 –28), 
Emotional Well- being (6 items; score range, 0 –24), Functional Well -being (7 items; 
score r ange, 0 – 28).36

The leukemia -specific subscale consists of 17 items (score range, 0 – 68) that asses s 
subject concerns relating to leukemia.  Three summary scales:  FACT -Trial Outcome 
Index (score range, 0 – 124) a summary  scale composed of the Phy sical Well -being, 
Functional Well -being, and leukemia -specific subscales; FACT -G (score range, 0 – 108) 
and the FACT -Leukemia Total (score range, 0 – 176) can also be calculated.  Higher 
scores are reflective of better HRQOL.  Minimally important differences (MI Ds) have 
been identified for the different FACT -Leu scales:  Phy sical Well -being, 2 – 3 points; 
Social /Family  Well -being, not available; Emotional Well- being, 2 points; Functional 
Well- being, 2 –3 points; FACT- G, 3 – 7 points; Leukemia -specific subscale, 4 – 7 points;

[IP_ADDRESS] EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D-5L)
The EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D-5L) is a generic preference instrument that has been 
validated in numerous populations.41,42  The EQ -5D-5L has five dimensions:  mobility , 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression.  These dimensions are 
measured on a five level scale:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe 
problems, and extreme problems.  The scores for the 5 dimensions are used to compute a 
single utility  index score rangin g from zero (0.0) to 1 (1.0) representing the general health 
status of the individual.  The EQ -5D-5L also contains a visual analog scale (VAS) to 
assess the subject's overall health.  The MID for the EQ- 5D utility  index score in cancer 
subjects is 0.08, an d the MI D for EQ -5D VAS is 7.43,44
Each of the five dimensions of the EQ -5D-5L, the VAS and overall utility  score will be 
calculated using the EuroQol scoring manual, and summarized (mean, std. dev., med ian) 
at each assessment.  The impact of treatment over time will be assessed b y calculating the 
change in score from baseline at each assessment time point.

5.6 Discussi on and Justification of Study  Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
Study  M15 -550 is being conducted primarily to assess the efficacy  of venetoclax 
monotherap y.  This study is a single -arm trial; therefore, there is no control grou p or 
treatment blinding.  The study  will be conducted at multiple study  centers globally  to 
ensure a broad representation of the patient population and clinical care settings. 
5.6.[ADDRESS_1227912] statistical, clinical, and laboratory  procedures will be utilized in this study .

M15 -550 Protocol Amendment [IP_ADDRESS].01 (ROW)
EudraCT [ADDRESS_1227913] Population
Venetoclax monotherap y has shown favorable activity in relapsed/refractory CLL subjects 
including subjects with 17p deletions.  Venetoclax is expected to be as active in subjects 
selected for TP53 mutations as these patient populations overlap and the oncogenic effect 
of both genetic defects occurs via p53 abrogation.  I n addition, venetoclax has shown 
activity  in subjects with relapsed or refractory  CLL who have been previously  treated with 
a B-cell receptor inhibitor.  These subjects can participate in this study  and may  have 
relapsed or be refractory  to ibrutinib, or idelalisib containing regimen.
All subjects enrolled in the study will have adequate performance status and hemato logic, 
renal and hepatic function to undergo venetoclax treatment.  
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
Venetoclax dosing will be introduced at an initial dose of 20 mg QD and escalated to a 
final dose of 400 mg QD.  The maximum dose of venetoclax for this pr otocol will not 
exceed 400 mg per day .  The daily  dose will be titrated in the following weekly  
increments, as tolerated:  20 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg.  The 400 mg final 
dose was selected for the ongoing, Phase 2 stud y of venetoclax monotherap y in 
relapsed/refractory  CLL subjects with 17p deletion (Study  M13 -982) based on 
time-to-response and logistic regression modelling of data from CLL/SLL subjects 
enrolled in the Phase 1 Study  M12 -175.
The initial 20 mg venetoclax dose and weekl y incrementa l increases in the dose -titration 
phase were implemented for Study  M13 -982 to reduce the risk of TLS.  Preliminary  
safet y data from that study indicate the initial dose, the dose -titration phase and the final 
maximum dose are tolerable.

6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, wh ether or not the event is considered causally  related to the use of the product.

EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
73
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  A ny 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity  of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adve rse 
events only  if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8 Toxicity  
Management) or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
For this protocol, disease progression is an efficacy endpoint.  These data will be captured 
as efficacy  assessment data only .  Thus, events that are clearly consistent with the 
expected pattern of progression of the underl ying disease (such as transformation to more 
aggressive histology ) will result in discontinuation from the study  and should not be 
recorded as adverse events but reported on the Study Complet ion eCRF.  However, if a 
subject experiences an adverse event (e.g., pneumonia, pyrexia, fatigue, etc.) and is also 
found to have disease progression, report the adverse event.  If there is an y uncertaint y as 
to whether an event is due to disease progressi on, it should be reported as an adverse 
event.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and 
the surgery /procedure has be en pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery /procedure is bein g done, will be considered an adverse event.
A treatment -emergent AE is defined as an y AE reported by a subject with onset or 
worsening from the time that the first dose of venetoclax is administered until [ADDRESS_1227916] elapsed following discontinuation of venetoclax administration.

important medical event.  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, bl ood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.  Deaths related to disease progression will 
not be recorded as serious adverse events (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a subject to allow observation and management (e.g., for IV h ydration) 
for the purpose of TLS prophy laxis will not be captured as an SAE, unless there is an 
additional reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878894] (e.g., abnormal post -dose TL S laboratories that necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, etc.).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a subject following the 30 -Day Safety  Follow -Up visit due to a 
subsequent line of therapy will not be captured as a SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Commonly  Associated with CLL Study 
Population and/or Progression of CLL
Certain AEs are anticipated to occur in the stud y population at some frequency 
independent of drug exposure.  Such events include known consequences of CLL 
(e.g., symptoms, disease progression) and events unlikely  to be related to the underl ying  
Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)

disease un der investigation but common in the study  population independent of drug 
therap y (e.g., cardiovascular events in an elderl y population).
These events are listed in Appendix I.
These AEs may  occur alone or in various combinations and are considered expected for 
reporting purposes for this protocol.
Cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocy topenia) are part of the natural history  of 
CLL.  Persistent cytopenias at the same CTCAE grade as reported at baseline are not to be 
captured as adverse events, unless they  fulfill a seriousness criteria, result in permanent 
discontinuation of a study drug, or the investigator had an identifiable cause other than the 
underly ing disease.  However, all laboratory  data should be entered regardless of whether 
an adverse event is reported.
Although exempted from expedited reporting to certain Health Authorities and ECs/I RBs 
as individual cases, if an event commonly asso ciated with CLL or progression of CLL 
meets seriousness criteria, it must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours of the site being 
made aware of the SAE (as defined in Section 6.1.5 ).  However, if the event was 
unequivocall y due to disease progression, it should not be reported as an adverse event 
even if serious or fatal.  For deaths related to disease progression, the date and cause of 
death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form, but the death will not be 
expedited as an individual case safet y report (ICSR) to regulatory authorities.

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Deaths 
For this protocol, overall survival is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the 
protocol -specified adverse even t reporting period (see Section 6.1.4) that are attributed b y 
the investigator solel y to progression of CLL should be recorded ONLY on the Study  
Completion eCRF.  All other on- study  deaths, regardless of relationship to study  drug, 
must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately  reported to the Sponsor 
(see Section 6.1.5).  Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The 
event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as 
the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generall y, only one such event 
should be reported.  The term "sudden death" should be used only  for the occurrence of an 
abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a subject with or without 
preexisting heart disease, within [ADDRESS_1227925] seen alive and stable.  
If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
"unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  I f the cause of

6.1.3 Relationsh ip to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clini cal judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
For causality  assessments, events ass essed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the inv estigator has not reported causality  or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_237421], an "Other Cause" of event must be provided by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator for the SAE.

6.1.8 Toxicity  Management
[IP_ADDRESS] Prophy laxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Sy ndrome
Venetoclax can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 
5-week dose -titration phase.  Changes in electroly tes consis tent with TL S that require 
prompt management can occur as earl y as 6 
–[ADDRESS_1227930] dose of 
venetoclax and at each dose increase. 
Risk Assessment for tumor ly sis sy ndrome:   The risk of TL S is a continuum based on 
multiple factors, including tumor burden and comorbidities.  Subjects with high tumor 
burden (e.g., an y lymph node with a diameter ≥5 cm or high absolute ly mphocy te count 
[ALC >25×109/L]) are a greater risk of TLS.  Reduced renal function (creatinine 
clearance [CrCl] < 80 mL/min ) further increases the risk.  The risk may  decrease as tumor 
burden decreases with venetoclax treatment. 
Additional comorbidities may further increase the risk for TL S.
Prior to initiating venetoclax, tumor burden assessment, including radiographic evalu ation 
(refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] Study  Procedures –CT scans) must be performed for all subjects 
during Screening.  The full blood chemistry /hematology  panel (refer to Table 4Clinical 
Laboratory  Tests) should be performed in all subjects during the Screening period in order 
to assess eligibility  and to correct pre -existing abnormalities. 
If the chemistry /hematology  panel was assessed more than 72 hours prior to the 1stdose of 
venetoclax, an additional full lab panel should be performed and reviewed within 72 hours 
prior to dosing in order to make a treatment decision.
Prophy laxis for tumor lysis sy ndrome:   The prophy laxis measures listed below should be 
followed.  More intensive measures (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) should be employ ed as 
overall risk increases:

EudraCT 2015 -003667 -11
83
Hydration:  
Subjects should be adequately  hydrated prior to starting treatment with venetoclax and 
during the dose -titration phase.  The recommended volume is 1.5 to 2.0 L  
(approximately  6 to 8 glasses) of water each day .  Subjects should be instructed to 
drink water starting [ADDRESS_1227931] dose, and every time the 
dose is increased.  Int ravenous (IV) fluids should be administered as indicated based 
on overall risk of TLS or for those who cannot maintain an adequate level of oral 
hydration.  For subjects for whom volume overload is considered a significant risk, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394746] c onsidered.
Anti-hyperuricemic agents:   Anti -hyperuricemic agents should be administered 2 to 
3days prior to starting treatment with venetoclax and may  be continued through the 
titration phase. 
Laboratory  Assessments:
PRE -DOSE LABS
Prior to the initial do se of venetoclax, for all subjects:
●During the Screening Period:   For all subjects, the chemistry/hematology panel 
(see Table 4Clinical Laboratory  Tests) is required.
○Pre-existing abnormalities should be corrected
●Within 72 hours of Week 1 Day  1:  If the screening labs were more than 72h 
before the planned first dose , the chemistry /hematology  panel should be repeated.  
These results should be reviewed before dosing.
○Labs should be assessed and pre -existing abnormalities should be corrected
●On the day  of Week 1 Day  1:  Before dosing, the chemistry /hematology  panel 
should be drawn.  The results of the labs drawn on Week 1 Day  1 need to be 
reviewed prior to dosing IFan additional lab within 72 hours of the initial dose at 
Week 1 Day  1 was not drawn AND reviewed.

84
Prior to each subsequent dose increase, for all subjects :
●Within 72 hours of each subsequent dose increase:   The chemistry /hematology  
panel should be repeated.  The results should be reviewed prior to dose increasing.
●Prior to dosing, on the day of each subsequent dose increase:   Before dosing, the 
chemistry /hematology  panel should be drawn.  The results of the labs drawn on 
Day [ADDRESS_1227932] -DOSE LABS:
For all subject s, the chemistry /hematology  panel (refer to Table 4Clinical Laboratory  
Tests) should be monitored at [ADDRESS_1227933] dose of 
venetoclax (20 mg) and after the first dose increase (50 mg).  Electroly te 
abnormalities should be corrected promptl y.  The next venetoclax doses (Day 2 20 mg 
venetoclax dose and Day 2 50 mg venetoclax dose) should not be administered until 
the [ADDRESS_1227934] been evaluated.  Electroly te abnormalities should be 
corrected promptl y.  For subjects who continue to be at risk of TLS, the same lab 
monitoring schedule (i.e., [ADDRESS_1227935] dose) should be followed at the 
subsequent dose i ncreases.
This monitoring is also recommended during the re -initiation of the therapy after a 
dose interruption.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  Based on investigator assessment, some subjects, especially those at 
greater risk of TLS may  require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878895] d ay of the first dose of 
venetoclax for more intensive prophylaxis and monitoring through the first 24 hours.

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modifications Based on Toxicities
Dosing i nterruption and/or dose reduction may  be required.  See Table 7for dose 
modifications for hematologic and other toxicities related to venetoclax.  For subjects who 
have had a dosing interruption greater than [ADDRESS_1227936] 5weeks of dose 
titration or greater than 2 weeks when at the dail y dose of 400 mg, TL S risk should be 
reassessed to determine if restarting at a reduced dose is necessary (e .g., all or some levels 
of the dose titration).
Tumor Lysis Syndrome
If a subject experiences blood chemistry changes suggestive of TL S, the following day 's 
venetoclax dose should be withheld.  If resolved within [ADDRESS_1227937] dose, 
treatment with venetoclax can be resumed at the same dose.  For events of clinical TL S or 
blood chemistry  changes requiring more than 48 hours to resolve, treatment should be 
resumed at a reduced dose (see Table 7and Table 8).  When resuming treatment with 
venetoclax after interruption due to TL S, the instructions for Prophy laxis for tumor ly sis 
syndrome should be followed.
Other Toxicities
Treatment with venetoc lax should be withheld for any  grade 3 or 4 non -haematological, 
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with infection or fever, or grade 4 haematological toxicities, 
except ly mphopenia.  To reduce the risk of infection associated with neutropenia, 
granulocy te-colon y stimulating factor (G -CSF) may  be administered with venetoclax if 
clinically indicated.  Once the toxicity  has resolved to grade 1 or baseline level (recovery ), 
therap y with venetoclax may be restarted at the same dose.  If the toxicity recurs, and for 
any subsequent occurrences, the dose reduction guidelines in Table 7and Table 8should 
be followed when resuming treatment with venetoclax following resolution.  A larger 
dose reduction may  occur at the discretion of the investigator.  For subjects who require 
dose reductions to less than 100 mg for more than 2 weeks due to adverse events, 
discontinuation of venetoclax should be considered.

Nonclinical and clinical experience indicates that venetoclax may cause neutropenia.  
Subjects with a history  of neutropenia who have received multiple prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or 
have significant bone marrow involvement may  be at a particularl y high risk.
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia has been reported in subjects treated with venetoclax.  Complete 
blood counts should be monitored throughout the treatment period.  Dose interruptions or 
dose reductions are recommended for subjects with sev ere neutropenia.  Supportive 
measures including antimicrobials for an y signs of infection and proph ylactic use of 
growth factors (e.g., G -CSF) should be considered. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunization 
Live attenuated vaccines should not be administered prior to, during, or after treatment 
with venetoclax until B -cell recovery  occurs.  The safet y and efficacy of immunization 
with live attenuated vaccines during or following venetoclax therap y have not been 
studied.  Patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effect ive.

study  conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A.
9.[ADDRESS_1227955] Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study .  Prior to an y stud y-related 
screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will 
be reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, the person who administered the 
informed consent, and any  other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy  of 
the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in 
the subject's medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject's dated source 
docum ents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to an y study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjec ts who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study  can be found in the informed consent form.
In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the stud y, stored biomarker 
samples will continue to be used for research and anal ysis.  In the event that a subject 
would like to withdraw consent for research using these samples, the subject may request 
that their samples be withdrawn.  Once [COMPANY_013] receives the request, remaining biomarker 
samples will be destro yed.  If the subject change s his/her consent, and the samples have 
alread y been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data.

●IV fluids (e.g., D5 1/2 normal saline) should be initiated at a rate of at least
1mL/kg/hr rounded to the nearest 10 mL (target 150 to 200 mL /hr; not 
<50mL/hr). Modification of fluid rate should also be considered for 
individuals with specific medical needs.
●Monitor for sy mptoms or signs of TLS (e.g., fever, chills, tachycardia, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, hypotension, muscle aches, weakness, 
paresthesias, mental status changes, confusion and seizures). If any clinical 
features are observed, rec heck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine within 1 hour STAT.
●Vital signs should be taken at time of all blood draws or an y intervention.
●The management recommendations below focus on the minimum initial 
responses required. If a diagnosis of TLS is established, ongoing intensive 
monitoring and multi -disciplinary  management will be per institutional 
protocols.
In addition to the recommendations in the table below, for subjects receiving the first dose 
of vene toclax.

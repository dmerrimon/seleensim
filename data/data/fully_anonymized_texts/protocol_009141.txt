Imaging  Biomarker  
IRB Number:  A#_21-037_______   
Study Description:  This is a cross -sectional study in patients with Lewy Body Dementia (DLB) with 
two comparison groups (AD and cognitively normal controls) drawn from a 
publicly available database called ADNI -2/3.  We intend to study dysfunctional 
large scale brain networks (LSBNs) in DLB by [CONTACT_656796] (rs -fMRI) imaging data. We propose using a novel cloud -based 
automated imaging software processing program that identifies abnormal brain networks or connectomes using rs -fMRI and data from the Huma n 
Connectome Project (HCP).  
Specific Aims : 
 Specific Aim #1:  Evaluate the role of rs -fMRI and connectomic analysis as a 
diagnostic imaging biomarker for LSBN deterioration in DLB by [CONTACT_23992] a clinic population of DLB patients with pre -existing data from an ADNI 2/3 
cohort of CN and MCI/mild AD subjects  
Specific Aim #2:  C
 orrelate cross -sectional dysfunction between LSBN 
parcellations with specific neuropsychological abnormalities in DLB patients   
Outcomes : Aim 1 Outcomes: Functional connectivity (FC) scores between pairs of LSBN 
parcellations. 
Aim 2 Outcomes: Functional connectivity (FC) scores between pairs of LSBN 
parcellations vs Neurophsychological test scores   
Study Population:  Inclusions : 1) Age 40 - 90 years, 2) Established  DLB diagnosis (McKeith Criteria 
2017), 3) MMSE>15  Exclusions : 1) O
 ther forms of dementia including, but not limited to 
Alzheimer’s dementia, frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, 
NPH,  etc, 2) Inability to tolerate brain fMRI, 3) Risk of brain fMRI due to 
implants or metal.    
Sample Size:  W e plan to enroll 19 DLB patients.   38 AD and  38 CN age and 
sex-matched  subjects  will be selected from the ADNI -2/3 database.

  2 2  INTRODUCTION  
2.1 BACKGROUND & STUDY RATIONALE  
  
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common neurodegenerative condition characterized by 
[CONTACT_656797], hallucinations, and cognitive fluctuations . This disease represents the second most 
common cause of dementia, affecting 1.4 million individuals (www.lbda.org). In comparison to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), DLB is a more rapid dementia that not only results in progressive cognitive decline, but also leads to a variety of non-cognitive symptom s that include 
motoric impairment, REM sleep behavioral disorder, psychosis, and autonomic dysfunction.  Disease progression is predicated on the propagation of alpha-synuclein aggregates from peripheral nervous system locations such as the olfactory cortex and enteric nervous system to central nervous system structures that include the brainstem and 
temporal cortex,  thus resulting in 
progressive deterioration of LSBNs (H 
Braak J Neurol 200).   
Detection rates of DLB in clinical p
ractice are suboptimal (Jones & 
O'brien, 2014) . To facilitate the diagnosis of this relatively common dementia, revised criteria have been 
developed based on core clinical features, supportive clinical features, and indicative biomarkers (table 
1) (McKeith et al., 2017) .  The diagnosis of probable DLB (greatest degree of certainty in the absence of 
confirmatory brain pathology) can be made when a patient has either [ADDRESS_884831]  effects of the disease: reduced dopamine 
transporter update on a DaT scan indicates parkinsonism, abnormal cardiac uptake on a 123iodine -MIBG 
myocardial scintigraphy suggest s autonomic dysfunction, and tonic contractions during REM sleep during 
polysomnography supports REM sleep behavioral disorder.  Limitations of these tests include a lack of specificity for this diagnosis (findings can be seen in Parkinson’s disease or mul tiple system atrophy), 
relatively higher costs, and lack of insurance coverage as in the case of the DaT scan.   
 F
urther complicating matters, there  are no universal imaging tools that directly show the impact of DLB 
on the CNS.  Structural brain MRI is relatively less helpful for diagnostic classification, described as a “supportive biomarker” meaning that it has a less critical role in determining diagnosis. MRI will support 
a DLB diagnosis when there is an absence of medial temporal lobe atrophy, commonly found in 
Alzheimer’s disease.  However, the sensitivity and specificity of this diagnostic test is suboptimal: a 
Table 1: Criteria for Dementia with Lewy Bodies  
   
 
  3 multisite study with autopsy confirmation showed that MRI was 64% sensitive and 68% specific for 
differentiating DLB from AD.  Fluorodeoxyglucose positive emission tomography (FDG- PET), a functional 
biomarker that has been used to support a DLB diagnosis, shows occipi[INVESTIGATOR_656784] (83%) and specificity for 
DLB (80%) (Minoshima et al., 2001; Yamamoto et al., 2007) . 
 
The role of brain rs -fMRI, an imaging tool that maps interactions between brain regions during a resting 
state and produces a blood -oxygen -level -dependent signal, has been only preliminarily evaluated in 
patients with DLB. Currently, there is no defined pattern of LSBN deterioration in this condition.  Certain 
investigations have failed to demonstrate characteristic differences between connectivity in DLB versus AD whereas others have demonstrated subtle difference (eg. increased precuneus -medial frontal 
connectivity (Galvin, Price, Yan, Morris, & Sheline, 2011) . A study consisting of 18 DLB, 18 AD, and 15 CN 
subjects showed that posterior cingulate cortex connectivity was lower in AD than in DLB (Franciotti et 
al., 2013) .  Another study evaluated rs -fMRI functional connectivity in 15 DLB, 13, AD, and 40 controls, 
showing that functional connectivity was lower in DLB in the default mode, salience, and executive 
networks compared to the other groups (Lowther, O’Brien, Firbank, & Blamire, 2014)  whereas a second 
study failed to show significant differences in LSBN connectivity between AD and DLB (Schumacher et al., 2018) .   
 The core symptoms of DLB (hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations, parkinsonism, and REM sleep behavioral 
disorder) may offer clues to the specific LSBNs impacted by [CONTACT_53220].  To our knowledge, few studies 
have evaluated the networks responsible for th ese symptoms and then attempted to leverage findings 
for diagnostic purposes.  The locus coeruleus, a brainstem structure containing abundant noradrenergic neurons with ascending pathways throughout the central nervous system, has been found to exhibit cel l 
loss in post -mortem analysis of DLB patients (Del Tredici & Braak, 2013)  and may be responsible for the 
characteristic cognitive fluctuations (O’Dowd et al., 2019).  fMRI studies have further shown that patients 
with disorders of consciousness exhibit compromise of those connections between the locus coeruleus, 
intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus, and nucleus basalis of Meynert (Edlow, Claassen, Schiff, & Greer, 
2020) .  It has also been demonstrated that neuronal loss and Lewy bodies in the nucleus basalis of 
Meynert are correlated with the reduction of choline acetyltransferase levels in DLB (Lippa, Smith, & 
Perry, 1999) .  Thus, we suspect that the locus coerulus and its ascending projections play a significant role 
in the arousal disturbances and cognitive fluctuations in DLB.  Parkinsonism results from disruption of connections between the substantia nigra and basal gan glia structures (Young & Penney, 1984) .  
Furthermore, findings of attention/executive dysfunction in DLB correlate with the basal ganglia, 
particularly the left caudate nucleus (Botzung, Philippi, Noblet, de Sousa, & Blanc, 2019) .   Finally, 
hallucinations in Lewy body are thought to involve dysfunction in a variety of brain areas.  A systemic 
literature search of 56 neuroimaging studies in PD and DLB with visual hallucinations were reviewed —the 
main structural neuroimaging result s showed grey matter loss in the frontal areas whereas functional 
investigations revealed parietal and temporal hypometabolism in PD with hallucinations (Pezzoli, Cagnin, Bandmann, & Venneri, 2017) .  Disrupted functional connectivity was also detected in the fronto -parietal 
regions through fMRI studies. One structure, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), which connects the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_656785], has been found to be dysfunctio nal in DLB (Kantarci et al., 2010) .  
We suspect that brain regions within this pathway may be compromised in DLB patients with visual hallucinations.  Preliminary work from our group has shown from that area PH, a region located within 
the anterioinferior lateral occipi[INVESTIGATOR_656786], is associated with visual 
hallucinations in schizophrenia and has white matter connections within the ILF.  This area is a higher -
level perception region of the visual system that acts as a hub of ventral stream input, integrating “place -
specific” information, while showing little to no activity to objects or faces (Baker, Burks, Briggs, Milton, 
   
 
  4 et al., 2018) .  There are connections to other brain regions including area or hub FST, which is involved in 
integrating information related to detail, motion, and form. Thus, our study will focus on pairwise 
functional connectivity between the seven parcellations list ed in Table [ADDRESS_884832]  
Cognitive fluctuations  Ascending brainstem 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_656787], basal nucleus of Meynert, 
intralaminar nucleus of thalamus (Edlow et 
al., 2020)

Parkinsonism  Ascending brainstem 
dopamine tracts  Substantia nigra, caudate nucleus (Young & 
Penney, 1984)  
 One potential challenge for functional imaging to this point is that brain parcellations (or distinct brain partitions) have been based on outdated models such as the Broadmann map from the 19
th century (Zilles, 
2018) . In 2009, the Human Connectome Project (HCP) began one of the most ambitious neuroscientific 
initiatives to map the brain (Fox, 2018; Glasser et al., 2016). This project identified [ADDRESS_884833] time in history the ability to view the brain not merely as a structural entity, but as an individualized network system.  
  Figure 1: Infinitome Program  – Removed for CT.GoV version  
 
Omniscient, a for -profit, Sydney, Australia-based company, created the cloud -based software Infinitome, 
a program that utilizes data from the HCP together with machine learning to analyze diffusion tensor and resting -state fMRI imaging data from remote sit es (Figure 1) .  The foundation for this imaging tool is based 
upon the HCP atlas, which has also informed prior publications from our group, including the Connectomic Atlas of the Human Cerebrum (Baker, Burks, Briggs, Conner, et al., 2018).  The Infinitome program creates 
a subject specific version of the Human Connectome Project Multimodal Parcellation (HCP -MMP1) atlas 
using diffusion tractography.  Analytics are performed on both diffusion tensor imaging and rs -fMRI.  
Outlier detection us ing a tangent space connectivity matrix is performed by [CONTACT_656798] a

2.2 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
2.2.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 Study has no Intervention.  
Imaging  
Structural MRI is a routine diagnostic procedure at HealthPartners, and the resting state portion merely requires 15 minutes of scan time.   The patient may experience claustrophobia with the narrow imaging space , and hearing loud noises while inside the machine . A MRI scan does not involve radiation like 
conventional X -rays.  Instead, images are generated using a magnetic field and radio signals.  Because an 
MRI scanner uses strong magnets, subjects will be screened by [CONTACT_656799] – as for a rout ine 
MRI.  People with artificial heart valve, metal plate, pin, or other metallic objects in their body (including gun shot or shrapnel) will not be eligible for this study.  
 Cogntive Assesments   
The questions on these assessments may make participants  feel uncomfortable because some parts may 
be easy to answer, while some parts may be difficult or tiring. It  may  also cause individuals  to feel 
uncomfortable or upset.  
 Loss of Confidentiality  
There may be a slight possibility of breach of confidential information that was collected. However, the following procedures will be implemented to reduce this risk:  
• Data collection and reporting tools will be developed and stored internally.  
• Data collected and stored electronically will remain confidential and secure (e.g. secured server 
and password protected files [REDCap]).  
• Study binders will be stored in a locked file cabinet within a locked office.  
• After the study is closed, all subject identifiers will be destroyed.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_884836] the opportunity to review novel rs -fMRI brain imaging that depi[INVESTIGATOR_656788].  
 By [CONTACT_18120] a novel and innovative cloud -based program that is based on machine learning and HCP 
data, this study will serve to develop rs -fMRI as a diagnostic biomarker for DLB.  
 
2.2.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
   
 
  6 We believe the p otential risks to the participants i n this study are minimal.  A significant portion of the 
study population will come from rs -fMRI from the publically accessible ADNI 2/[ADDRESS_884837] providers and patients from the risk of breach of 
confidentiality:  
• A unique study ID code unrelated to the medical record number or other study subject -specific 
information will be assigned to each patient and used to link data from various sources and needed for analysis.  The study number will be used on the RedCap database and Infinitome Program.  All imaging data uploaded from the NSC research site will be de -identified and uploaded 
to the Infinitome cloud -based server.   
• Infinitome program uses an industrial grade cyber security that is superior to what is offered at 
the leading medical device companies.  No personal health information is stored on servers and 
only de -identified scans are stored on a dedicated edge node on  encrypted MinIO instances.  
Patient data is only accessed through authenticated calls form Kubernetes pods contained in the VPC.  The web service requires user authentication.  Only the data related to a specific facility can be retrieved through authenti cated calls and are restricted to their use.

NA 
 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
 
Pre- screening Phone Call: All potential participants will undergo a pre -screening phone  or a video  call to 
determine whether they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will be considered ineligible  if they 
do not meet one or more of the inclusion/exclusion criteria during pre -screening. We will collect 
information on why participants are ineligible or decide not to move forward with the trial.  
 
Screen failures  are defined as participants who are considered eligible during the pre -screening phone 
call, but it was subsequently determined that they do not meet one or more of the incl usion/exclusion 
criteria. We will collect information on why participants screen fail or decide not to move forward with 
the trial.  
 
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 Recruitment:  For Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), analysis will be based on data 
available from the database. As such there are no recruitment or retention activities.  rs-fMRI data as well 
as variables listed in Table 3 & 4 will be downloaded from ADNI- 2/3 for age/sex -matched mild AD (with 
supportive biomarkers) and age/sex -matched CN patients.  
 
Clinic Population: Potential DLB subjects will be referred to the study coordinator by [CONTACT_656801].  Participants with clinic visits will meet with research staff. Other patients will be mailed/e -mailed a letter and flyer/brochure.  An informed consent 
form will be provided to those individuals expressing interest in the study.  A video or phone encounter will be arranged to provide additional details of the study and informed consent. This study will be listed as one of the regional DLB investigations on the Alzheimer’s Association Trial Match website.  All referrals will be directed to study staff who will contact [CONTACT_656802].  Participation will include one virtual visit and two in -person visits at HealthPartners Neuroscience Center.  
To reach our target enrollment, we anticipate that we will need to screen 40 people,  of those 19 
individuals will sign the informed consent .  
 
Remuneration: Participants will be provided gift cards totaling $[ADDRESS_884842].  
   
 
  9 An investigator may withdraw a participant from the study if:  
• Any medical condition, event or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study 
would not be in the best interest of the subject.  
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that precludes further study participation.   
• Significant study procedure non -compliance  
• Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130]  
5.6.[ADDRESS_884843] be taken if a participant fails to attend any required study visit:  
• Study  staff  will attempt  to  contact  [CONTACT_47991],   reschedule  the  missed  visit,   counsel  
the  participant  on  the  importance  of  maintaining  the  assigned  visit  schedule  and  
ascertain  if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a  participant  is  deemed  lost  to  follow -up,  the  investigator  or  designee  will make 
every effort  to  regain  contact  [CONTACT_391327]  (where  possible,  telephone  calls  or  e -
mail –  if  no  answer  leave  a  voicemail  on  the  first  and  last  attempt).  These  contact  
[CONTACT_391328].  
• Should  the  participant  continue  to  be  unreachable,  he  or  she  will  be  considered  to  have  withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up.

7.1.4  MRI IMAGING  
Subjects will undergo MRI imaging at HealthPartners Neuroscience Center. Subjects will be screened for 
any contraindications for MRI. Subjects will undergo a protocol based on recommendation by 
[CONTACT_391331] (o8t MR Acquisition Recommendations). We anticipate 15 minutes of scan run time using a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner and the following images will be obtained.  
1) High- resolution multi-scan directional diffusion scan, which is most similar to a diffusion tensor 
image (DTI) acquisition - Specifically, diffusion weighted imaging with the following acquisition 
parameters will be used:  2 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm voxels, FOV = 25.6 cm, matrix = 128 mm x 128 
mm, slice thickness = 2.0 mm, one non- zero b -value of b = 1000, 40 directions, and gap = 0.0 
mm.

7.2 ADNI DATABASE  
A data use agreement with ADNI will be completed prior to downloading the data for analysis from the 
ADNI database  (ADNI Database) . A user login – for research staff will be used for downloading the data.  
 All necessary ADNI data for MCI, mild AD patients, and cognitively normal (CN) will be downloaded to a local secure server for further analysis.  
 Data will be obtained regarding demographics, medical history, cognitive assessments (as mentioned in earler sections), MMSE for eligibility, biomarkers and imaging ( as mentioned in the previous section). The imaging data will be uploaded and processed with the Infinitome software as stated in the previous section s.   
 
7.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
7.3.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_19819] ( OHRP ). OHRP  considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
   
 
  13 3. Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
7.3.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS REPORTING  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_199779] ( UPs) to the reviewing IRB. The UP report will include the 
following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number  
• A detailed description of the event, i ncident, experience, or outcome  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP  
 To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs will be reported to the IRB  as soon as possible, but no  later than [ADDRESS_884847] learns of the event  
 
7.3.3  REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS TO PARTICIPANTS  
 Following IRB review of any unanticipated problems, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_252044]’s recommended actions. This may include, but is not limited to, modifying the informed consent document or process, re -
consenting current participants, providing information to past or current participants (e.g. whenever the 
information may relate to the participant’s willingness to continue participants), and modifications to the 
protocol/research plan.  
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 STATISTICA L ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
Preliminary data analysis:  One-way ANOVA will be used to compare demographic and baseline clinical 
characteristics across groups. **no missing data expected, SAS, p -value  
Aim 1 Analysis: For the between -g roup analysis of functional connectivity, general linear model 
multivariate analysis of variance will be used with FC values between pairs of LSBN parcellations as 
dependent variables and group (DLB, AD, and CN) as a factor variable. Bonfe rroni post hoc test will be 
used to correct for multiple comparisons. The primary pairs of interest (see Table 4 ) based on available 
literature (see background and Table 2 ) will be analyzed first. Other combinations of these seven 
parcellat ions will be analyzed secondarily. If additional, unexpected anomalies are present between 
groups, we will test them in an exploratory fashion to advance this novel field of study.  
   
 
  14 Aim 2 Analysis:  Pearson correlation analyses will be performed between functional connectivity values 
and neuropsychological test scores to evaluate the relationship between connectivity strengths and the 
clinical phenotype of DLB. Similar to Aim 1, we will focus on pre -specified pairs of interest, but will 
explore others if they present themselves in the functional connectivity analysis.  
 
 
Table 4:  Data Variables   
Population Descriptors:  age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, measures of baseline cognition (e.g. 
MoCA)  
Aim 1: Evaluate the role of rs -fMRI and connectomic analysis as a biomarker of disease in DLB using 
data from an ADNI -2/3 population of MCI and mild AD subjects and a clinic population of DLB 
subjects  
Group variable:  DLB, AD, or CN  
Dependent variables:  Functional connectivity (FC) scores between pairs of LSBN parcellations  
• Primary pairs of interest (see background for justification of these choices):  
o Locus coeruleus v. Basal nucleus of Meynert  
o Locus coeruleus v. Intralaminar nucleus of thalamus  
o Basal nucleus of Meynert v. Intralaminar nucleus of thalamus  
o PH v. FST  
o Substantia nigra v. Caudate nucleus  
• Exploratory pairs: Other 15 combinations of the pre -specified parcellations, other pairs of 
parcellations found to be anomalies by [CONTACT_656804] 2: Correlate cross -sectional  dysfunction between LSBN parcellations with specific 
neuropsychological abnormalities in DLB Patients  
Functional connectivity (FC) scores between pairs of LSBN parcellations (same primary pairs of interest

among the means versus the alternative of equal means using an F test with a 0.[ADDRESS_884849] deviation greater than or equal to 0.02, which we anticipate being able to achieve based 
on previous research. All significant brain connection couples in Franciotti’s work had standard deviations of the group means greater than 0.06.  
For post -hoc tests, group sample sizes of 19 DLB, 38 AD, and 38 CN patients achieve 81% power to reject 
the null hypothesis of equal means when the population mean difference is 0.[ADDRESS_884850]

9 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
  
9.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
ADNI:  We are requesting a waiver of written informed consent for all ADNI data for the following reasons: 
1) The data is retrospective and will be downloaded from a database, 2) There is no additional data collection, and 3) It would be impractical to consent patients (due to large numbers) if written informed consent of patients were required. A data use agreement with ADNI will be completed prior to downloading the data for analysis from the ADNI database.   
 Clinic: All research study staff will maintain certification in human subject’s protection. All study 
investigators and staff will take an active role in developi[INVESTIGATOR_553728]- being of enrolled participants.  Potential research subjects will be 
informed that participation in this study is voluntary and will not be discriminated against if they choose not to participate. Written informed or electronic consent and assent will be obtained from participants, and f amily member/caregivers or legally authorized representatives (LAR). Participants will be asked to 
describe in their own words the study’s expectations. Subjects will be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any time and will be given a copy of the consent form. Subjects will have written 
assurance that while de -identified individual subject data may be available to other researchers for 
research purposes, or used to improve the software program, only a summary of the results will ever be publis hed or otherwise publicly released. Subjects will be assured that participation in the study will be 
strictly confidential, that any identifying information will be available to the study staff only, and that no identifying information concerning the data and results will be made known.  
 Potential research subjects will be informed that participation in this study is voluntary and that their decision to participate will not reflect upon their relationships with the Center for Memory and Aging, Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or HealthPartners. Subjects will be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any time and will be given a copy of the consent form.    With the electronic consent via REDCap the patient/caregiver providing consent will be able to review the consent form themselves and sign electronically with a stylus, touch screen, or cursor using a signature 
[CONTACT_290312]. After the individual has rec eived the link and can view the consent form, the research 
staff member will go through the consent form with the individual as would be typi[INVESTIGATOR_290302]. Following 
the consent conversation, the staff member will sign and e -mail the consent and HIPPA elec tronically to 
the patient. The patient will electronically sign, certify, and submit the consent and HIPPA in REDCap. A fully executed PDF copy of the consent and HIPPA will be provided electronically to the patient for their records as well as saved via t he auto -archiver function in REDCap.

At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_3488], Institutional policies, or sponsor /funding agency  
requirements.  
 A unique study ID code unrelated to the medical record number or other study subject -specific 
information will be assigned to each patient and used to link data from various sources and needed for analysis.  The study number will be used on the RedCap database and Infinitome Program.  All imaging data uploaded from the NSC research site will be de -identified and uploaded to the Infinitome cloud -
based server.    Infinitome program uses an industrial grade cyber security that is superior to what is offered at the leading medical device companies.  No personal health information is stored on servers and only de -identified 
scans are stored on a dedicated edge node on  encrypted MinIO instances.  Patient data is only accessed

Our primary aim was to evaluate the role of rs -fMRI and connectomic analysis as a diagnos�c 
imaging biomarker of disease for LSBN deteriora�on in DLB by [CONTACT_23992] a clinical popula�on of 
DLB pa�ents with the ADNI 2/3 cohort of CN and AD/CI subjects. Speciﬁcally, we compared FC 
scores of prespeciﬁ ed parcella�on pairs between the three groups using a one -way ANOVA. Eight 
parcella�on pairs were chosen as the primary pairs, and twenty -two as the exploratory pairs.  
 
Aim 2  
Our secondary aim (aim 2) was to correlate cross -sectional dysfunction between LSBN 
parcellations with specific neuropsychological abnormalities in DLB patients. To accomplish this, 
we performed a two -stage analysis. First, we compared cognitive test score s between groups to 
understand which successfully distinguished between the cohorts. When possible, test scores were normed, i.e., converted to a Z - or T-score adjusted for age, sex, and years of education.  
Primary Comparisons/A Priori Hypotheses:  
1) ADAS Number Cancellation Targets will be lower in DLB patients  
2) Trails B time will be higher in DLB patients  
3) Clock Drawing Tests will be lower in DLB patients  
4) ADAS construction praxis score will be lower in DLB patients  
5) Category Fluency Animals will be lower in AD patients  
6) RAVLT recognition will be lower in AD patients  
 
The remaining comparisons were  exploratory: Trails A �me, RAVLT immediate recall, RAVLT delayed recall, 
Func�onal Ac�vi�es Ques�onnaire (FAQ), Logical Memory Immediate, and Logical Memory Delayed. Digit 
Span Forward, Digit Span Backward, and [LOCATION_011] Naming Test we re either missing or highly incomplete in 
ADNI controls; therefore, they were  described in the DLB cohort only.

06 FEB 2024   PI: [INVESTIGATOR_656795] [ADDRESS_884858] scores with FC  scores  from the 
primary parcella�on group in Aim 1, within diagnosis (DLB, CN, or AD/CI) and compared these 
correla�ons across diagnosis group. As above, we prespeciﬁed [ADDRESS_884859] and consider 
the remaining correla�ons to be exploratory. Because of the h igh volume of sta�s�cal tests 
performed in the exploratory analysis, we used the Holm correc�on to adjust the p -values in the 
exploratory correla�ons only.  
 
Primary/ A Priori Hypotheses:  
1) Caudate R / Substantia Nigra R and the Clock Drawing Test will be diﬀerently correlated for DLB patients 
vs other groups.  
2) Caudate R / Substantia Nigra R and the ADAS Number Cancellation Targets will be diﬀerently correlated 
for DLB patients vs other groups.  
3) FST R/PH Rand the ADAS construction praxis will be diﬀerently correlated for DLB patients vs other 
groups. 
4) FST  R / PH  R and the Clock Drawing Test will be diﬀerently correlated for DLB patients vs other groups.  
 
With respect to the exploratory correla�ons, we used a signiﬁcance threshold of p  < 0.15, which is an 
accepted approach for detec�ng eﬀects in emerging research areas where it’s preferable to err on the 
side of iden�fying novel eﬀects versus failing to reject a null hypothesis when it is false (Type II error).

2.2 Speciﬁc Aim s 
 
1) Will postpartum women who had elevated blood pressure during pregnancy be willing to 
participate in the study, talk to a pharmacist about their health and the health of their child, and 
text us their blood pressure measurements?  
 
2) Will contact [CONTACT_142007]/or the child?  
 
3. Subject Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
3.1 Inclusion Criteria   
 
• Age 18 –  55 years  
• biological mother of a baby [CONTACT_142008] a 1- week to 6- month well -child visit,  
• received prenatal care at University of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84059],  
• had at least 2 elevated blood pressures (>= 130 mmHg systolic or >= 80 mmHg 
diastolic) during pregnancy,  
• owns a smartphone  
 
3.3 Exclusion Criteria 
• arm circumference > 17 inches,  
• prisoner status  
• unable to provide own written informed consent  
 
4. Study Design  
4.[ADDRESS_161359] will address the mother’s health concerns and monitor her blood pressure. The pharmacist will also answer questions about infant health and stress the importance of well child -visits, child immunizations, and 
breastfeeding. The pharmacist will work closely and collaboratively with the child’s pediatrician.  
 
4.2 Recruitment/Screening Procedures  
 
A member of the research team will screen the schedule of the participating clinic each day for infants attending their 1-2- week to [ADDRESS_161360] age range is identified by [CONTACT_142009], the research team member will see if the infant's biological mother has an Epic medical record, received her prenatal care at UIHC, and had at least 2 elevated blood pressur es (≥ 130 
mmHg systolic or ≥  80 mmHg diastolic) during her pregnancy. If all of these are confirmed, the 
research team member will inform the medical team that the mother is eligible for the study and ask when the best time will be to approach the mother about the study. When the medical team approves, the research team member will approach the mother and ask if she has a smartphone. If she does, they will tell her about the study. If she is interested in participating, they will present her with the informed consent, answer any questions she may have, and get 
her written informed consent.  
If the mother is not interested in participating at that time and she is not attending the 6 -month 
well-child visit, we will ask her if we can approach her again at a later date. If she answers "no", 
we will not approach her again. If she answers, "yes", we will attempt to approach her at the next well -child visit. 
 
4.3 Visit Procedures  
 
After consent, participants will complete a baseline demographic survey interview -style with the 
research team member. Then, they will be provided with a blood pressure cuff and taught how 
to use it. They will be scheduled in Boomerang (the research team's bi- directional text 
messaging system) to complete baseline blood pressure measurements [ADDRESS_161361] the mother's co- morbidities 
from her medical record.  
 
After the [ADDRESS_161362] will help the mother find a primary care 
physician if she doesn't have one, obtain health insurance if she doesn't have any, and discuss 
any health- related information about herself or her child, as needed. These pharmacist 
interactions will occur 7 days after baseline and again 1 month later (the participant will be 
asked to measure and text their blood pressure again 1 time per day for 3 days during the 
follow- up month). If the participant's blood pressures become elevated, the pharmacist will 
provide behavioral and lifestyle interventions to attempt to lower the blood pressure. They may 
also recommend medications to the participant's physician. The pharmacist will have access to 
the participant's electronic medical record to obtain any blood pressure- related medications that 
the mother is prescribed as well as throughout the follow up to ensure any health- related 
conditions can be discussed, as necessary. Each monthly call is expected to last [ADDRESS_161363], the number of participants who visit a primary care physician, the mother's BP, the number of well- child visits attended, and the number of 
vaccinations received by [CONTACT_2252].  
 We will stratify these outcomes by [CONTACT_142010]: before the [ADDRESS_161364] chosen 25 participants as this is a reasonable number to enroll during the funding window and will provide enough data to inform future 
studies.

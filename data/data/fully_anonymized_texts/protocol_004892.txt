 Significance  
Scope of the Problem  
The number of Americans  65 years and older will double in size over the next 40 years.1 Aging brings 
increased cognitive decline.2 Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is of particular 
concern to the health care system , with an expected two- fold increase in prevalence over the next [ADDRESS_807779] research investment . There is evidence that risk of cognitive 
decline can be moderated  by [CONTACT_609156],5-12 although the extent literature  
is not conclusive.13-16 Conflicting evidence is likely a result of imprecisely controlled interventions and a lack of 
understanding about key target mechanisms. There are several potential mechanisms that may relate exercise 
with brain health . Our aims are designed to specifically explore cerebral blood flow  (CBF) as a potential 
mechanism  of exercise effects on brain and cognition, and is specifically related to the APOE allele, the 
strongest genetic risk factor for late -onset AD. . Understanding how exercise promotes cognition and brain 
health is essential  to fully capi[INVESTIGATOR_609139].   
 
Exercise Represents a Promising Strategy for Reducing Risk of Cognitive Decline  
Exercise --defined as planned, repetitive physical activity -- has a biologically plausible and temporal 
relationship with heart disease,[ADDRESS_807780] 
effective tools available for chronic disease management.26 Our work along with others’ strongly suggests that 
moderate- intensity aerobic exercise benefits brain health and cognition.10,11,27-30 
 
Exercise,  Cognition and Brain Health:  Longitudinal studies suggest physical activity is positively associated 
with cognition and brain health and reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia.5,6,31-[ADDRESS_807781] repeatedly demonstrated benefits of aerobic exercise on cognition (particularly in 
executive and visuospatial function) and measures of brain health such as whole brain and hippocampal 
volume in people with and without cognitive decline.7-11,13,39-43  
 
Cerebrovascular Health is Vital for Cognitive Function and Brain Health  
The brain is  intolerant of ischemia and highly dependent on healthy blood supply, requiring up to 25% of whole 
body resting O2 consumption.[ADDRESS_807782] and during exercise ( see Figure 1) .[ADDRESS_807783] may provide a more sensitive and relevant 
measure for detecting differences in subjects at risk for AD.   
 
Cerebral Blood Flow  Improves with 
Exercise:  There is considerable interest 
in precisely defining cerebrovascular 
adaptations to aerobic exercise and 
how those adaptations may support cognitive function.
66,[ADDRESS_807784],75 and other s reporting no 
difference.76  
 Our work demonstrates  the importance of measuring dynamic response to exercise. Drs. Billinger and 
Vidoni recently described the dynamic change in a measure of CBF with onset of exercise in young and older 
individuals  (Figure 2)[ADDRESS_807785] . 
 Increased CBF can be measured by 
[CONTACT_609157] (ASL)  MRI.  Optimal 
imaging parameters to capture CBF 
response to acute exercise using ASL, identifying a 20% increase immediately 
following an acute bout of exercise.  
[ADDRESS_807786] conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (n=11) to 
examine changes in blood flow following acute exercise (50- 70% max HR) 
compared to quiet rest in smokers . ASL 
was performed ~ 30 minutes after exercise. 
Analyses revealed a pattern of increased 
CBF generally, and  in ACC and precentral 
gyrus specifically, p <0.16.  
 
This collective body of work demonstrates our ability to capture CBF change with highly coordinated, precisely 
timed acute exercise protocols. It also provides a compelling case for exploring the cerebrovascular exercise 
response in relationship to AD risk .  
 
 
Interaction of CBF, neurotrophins, and APOE Genotype:  The scientific  premise  underlying this proposal is 
that CBF and blood -based biomarkers such as VEGF, BDNF, and IGF1 are interrelated mechanisms driving 
chronic aerobic exercise effects on brain health and cognition. Several lines of evidence are now converging to 
point to these interacting factors as critical for supporting cognition and brain health into old age.  
 There are well -documented differences in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and tissue oxygenation based on age 
or APOE genotype,54,78-80 with dele terious consequences for cognition.54,81 Cerebrovas cular endothelial cells 
respond to the shear force stress on the vessel walls by [CONTACT_609158].82,83 Further, carotid occlusion 
extinguishes exercise- induced BDNF increases in the brain, strongly suggesting that increased cerebral blood 
flow is a key trigger of BDNF release.83 Therefore, maintenance or improvement in CBF is likely an important 
mediator brain health and cognitive effects as we age.75,84,85 
 Because VEGF is a salient promoter of vascularization, it is an evident candidate for association with CBF. 
Previous work demonstrates that rodent neuro- and angiogenesis are coupled with CBF following an exercise

And, though we know individuals with cognitive impairment (MCI or AD) have lower serum BDNF levels90-[ADDRESS_807788] failed to demonstrate a relationship between E4 carriage and 
circulating BDNF levels in cognitively normal individuals.93,94  
 
 
 
Approach  
We will significantly reduce participant burden and speed execution by [CONTACT_609159], one of 31  NIH-designated Alzheimer’s Centers of Excellence. The KU ADC follows over [ADDRESS_807789] research program and will enhance ou r ability to measure  acute exercise  response.  We are confident in 
our timing and are currently conducting a study that requires blood draws before and 15min after exercise.  
 
Overall Study Design: Up 90 participants will be recruited from the KU Alzheimer’s Disease Center (KU ADC)  
and the community . For this study, participants will attend one visit at the Hoglund Brain Imaging Center on the 
University of Kansas Medical Center campus . Performing all activities at the single visit reduces burden on 
participants and allows capture of  key biomarkers in temporal relationship following a rigorous, time -sensitive 
protocol.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria are further detailed in the Human Subjects section .  
 
Recruitment:  E4 carriers make up approximately 33% of the Clinical Cohort. We have an estimated  90 non-
demented individuals that we can approach with an E4 allele. Based on our experience, ~60% of eligible 
Cohort enrollees will consent to the proposed project. Additionally, [CONTACT_6318] directs a robust Outreach & 
Recruitment Core which maintains a list of 7500+ individuals who have expressed interest in dementia 
research.[ADDRESS_807790] created by [CONTACT_609160] (2 E4 carriers:1 non- carrier). A 
co-investigator not in contact [CONTACT_609161] (Morris) will monitor enrollment for E4 carriage and request contact [CONTACT_609162].  We will exclude individuals with an E2 allele. W e will 
make efforts to preferentially match APOE4 genotype groups based on sex.  
 In some instances, potential participants who have not been characterized  in the past 6  months or at all  by [CONTACT_609163] #[ADDRESS_807791] in participating . In these instances, the participant will be 
invited to identify a study partner so that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_609140], the QDRS
99. A study 
partner who knows the participant well will be required to answer the QDRS questions over the phone.  
 We will use an approved phone screening consent from the potential participant t o get basic demographic and 
screening information and the name [CONTACT_4007] a study partner who knows the potential participant well. We will then 
use an approved phone consent for the study partner and ask questions regarding the cognition and function 
of the potential participant  (approximately 10 minutes) to qualify the individual for the study. Given that all 
participants will have already been initially prescreened through our Recruitment and Eligibility Database 
(#140406) we do not believe we will encounter any individuals who cannot consent for themselves.  
  
 
Study Protocol  
After passing initial screening participants will attend a single study visit. Written informed consent will be 
provided either during the visit, or prior to the visit via the telephone or an internet meeting (e.g. Zoom). If consent is performed prior to the visit, the study team will eit her send a paper copy of the consent to the 
potential participant or provide a REDCap link to a REDCap for with the consent downloadable one week 
before the visit. If the participant chooses to have a paper copy mailed, the staff member will perform 
consenting as usual over the phone or internet and the participant will return the consent to the staff before or 
at the visit. If the potential participant  chooses to receive an email link, the staff member will perform 
consenting as usual over the phone and t he participant will electronically sign the REDCap form using a 
signature [CONTACT_72392].  
 
Strict timing of the protocol is necessary  to capture response to acute exercise for CBF [ASL] (Table 1). ASL 
measures are time -sensitive and have been planned based on prior work.  
 
Table 1. Steps in the Protocol are Highly Time -dependent (Exercise warm -up start begins timing 
[T0]) Time  
1. Staff conduct informed consent  and MRI safety screen.  Then  the participant changes into 
approved MRI compliant clothing.  Variable  
2. Cognitive tests  are administered  on an iPad.  Some participants who have not had a recent 
Clinical Cohort evaluation may be required to complete additional paper based cognitive 
assessments (~ 20 minutes) to index cognitive function.  Variable  
3. The participant is escorted to the MRI suite, situated on the imaging table and a baseline 
scanning is performed  for about 20 minutes . Variable  
 
4. Vitals are taken. A catheter is placed in the antecubital or other appropriate vein for ~10mL blood 
draw  (if participant declines or is unable, repeated sticks may be used) . An additional ~6mL blood 
draw will be taken for those not previously genotyped.  Variable  
5. The participant moves to the space  with exercise device . Seat height is adjusted, and participant 
is familiarized with device  and cadence.    
6. The participant  works  at a certain  cadence  and resistance according to an algorithm  for a 2 min 
warm- up.64 Then, staff increases workload incrementally over 3 min to reach 65- 75% of age 
predicted heart rate maximum (APHRmax).  T0-T5 
7. The participant maintains cadence while study staff titrate workload to maintain 6 5-75% 
APHRmax for 15 min. After 15 min, ~ 10mL blood and vitals  are taken immediately. T he 
participant cools -down self -selected cadence  and low load  for [ADDRESS_807792] allotted 8 minutes for repositioning 
understanding that this population may need additional time to maximize comfort.  T28-T36 
9. At time T36,  additional MRI  sequences in succession are acquired.  Scan time is approximately 24 
minutes   T36-T60 
10. At time T60, participants return to the testing room for cognitive testing and  ~10mL blood draw 
and vitals.  Variable  
 
Exercise Dose:  Several different aerobic workloads (from  ~50%100 to 100% of maximum  capacity101,102 and 
durations (15 minutes103,104 to 4 hours 105) have been used in prior studies of response to acute exercise. Our 
experience informs the selected exercise parameters as  achievable by [CONTACT_21140].34,46,96,106 
 Participants will exercise for 15 minutes at 65 -75% of age- predicted heart rate maximum (APHRmax) 
calculated as 208 -0.7*Age or 220 minus age to be determined by [CONTACT_609164], age, and 
perceived fitness level .107  We will use either an electronically braked cycle ergometer (Lode, Groningen, 
Nederland) or a NuStep recumbent stepper (NuStep, Ann Arbor, MI) to maintain precise control over workload 
and heart rate.[ADDRESS_807793] blood volume measured by [CONTACT_9268]. 
 
Blood Draw:  Following catheter placement prior to exercise, blood ( ~10mL) will be drawn into a serum -
separating vacutainer tube. An identical blood draw will be performed immediately after exercise and after 
post-exercise cognitive testing.  Serum will be processed and frozen at -80C until further analysis using 
colorimetric ELISA for our identified blood- based biomarkers. Some blood will be banked for future analysis.  
 Blood draws will be performed at Hoglund by [CONTACT_65384]. If the participant has not previously 
been genotyped as part of a KU ADC study, an additional ~ 6mL of blood will be drawn at baseline for the 
purposes of genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
Imaging Parameters : The investigative team has extensive ex perience with imaging and preliminary evidence 
to demonstrate the necessary skill set for capturing time -dependent ASL changes due to exercise. We will 
employ imaging sequences most suited to capture anatomical and brain blood flow, lasting ~20 minutes bef ore 
exercise and ~30 minutes after exercise.  
 
Cognitive Testing:  Evidence suggests that subtle, transient cognitive effects of exercise are detectable 
immediately following an acute exercise bout in older adults.108-110 We will employ a short battery of cognitive 
tests to capture exercise- related change in: executive control, epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], and processing speed. The 
battery w ill last ~[ADDRESS_807794] is an executive function task that measures inhibitory control 111,112 with a well- documented 
history of indexing change following exercise intervention40,112-117 (our long term goal), and early in AD.118,119  
 
 
Aim 1: Characterize CBF change after exercise. Our primary outcome of interest for Aim [ADDRESS_807795] to immediately after exercise. S econdary outcomes will be absolute 
change in CBF  (ml/100g tissue/min)  and spatial coefficient of variation (an indirect measure of arterial transit 
time).[ADDRESS_807796] blunted exercise -induced change in CBF.  
 
Aim 1 Statistical Analyses : Custom software utilizing the ASL Toolbox for SPM 12 will quantify global CBF.120 
Our primary and secondary outcome measures are continuous, and thus we will use linear mixed models 
(LMM).  We will include a random intercept coefficient to allow for each pre -post exercise pair to account for 
individual baseline differences . Age group  will be modeled as  a fixed effect . Other analysis techniques may be 
employed as they become available.  
 
Sample Size:  To our knowledge, there are currently no peer -reviewed reports of genotype- based CBF 
differences in response to acute exercise. However, perfusion measures in genetic risk for AD (APOE e4)  have  
been performed previously and can form the basis of a reasonable power analyses. Thus, our  sample size was 
determined based primarily on feasibility and preliminary data.  First,  KU is uniquely suited to perform this 
study. W e have had success in recruiting and characterizing individuals for imaging and exercise studies under  
complex protocols. Second, two prior cross -sectional estimates of the relationship of perfusion and e4 carriage 
have delivered similar effect sizes  (d=1.0).78,[ADDRESS_807797] to be able to discern differences 
between sex, and between older adults with and w ithout cognitive impairment.  
 
 
Exploratory Aim: Describe the relationship between CBF and cognitive performance after acute 
exercise. Our primary outcome will be the response time on the Eriksen Flanker Task. We will explore these 
cognitive effects in individuals, assessing how CBF and our blood- based biomarkers relate to cognitive 
improvements . These data will set the stage for future w ork assessing who responds to habitual exercise with 
cognitive improvemen ts, and through what mechanisms.  
 
Exploratory  Aim Statistical Analyses:  We will use the same least squares regression approach as in Aim 2.  
 
Data Management:  Study data will be collected and managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap) web -based, electronic data capture tools .121 Imaging data will be archived and backed up on a 
dedicated XNAT server operated by [CONTACT_609165]. Hoglund also maintains an imaging 
analysis server that provides researcher s access to up- to-date imaging software (e.g. SPM). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_306640] 
[ADDRESS_807798] role- based access  and regular backup .  
 
 Participant Compensation  
Participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_807799] system.  
 
Protection of Human Participants   
a. Human Participants  Involvement and Characteristics:   
For this study , we plan to enroll  up to 80 participants from our sc reening population (the KU ADC Clinical 
Cohort , and Recruitment Database ), other research databases on the KUMC campus (e.g. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_609141])  and the community . Goal enrollment is:  
 1) up to 20 individuals , age 18- 65 
 3) 60, age 65- 85  ( approximately equal APOE4 carrier  and APOE4 non -carrier)  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
• Age 18- 85 (inclusive)   
• English speaking  
• Normal or corrected hearing or vision,  
 
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
• Cognitive impairment  (adjudication can include CDR> [ADDRESS_807800] 6 months ) unless 
under age 50 for which cognitive adjudication by [CONTACT_609166]).   
• Clinically significant cognitive or psychiatric illness , or other n eurological disorders that have the potential 
to impair cognition (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, stroke defined as a clinical epi[INVESTIGATOR_609142]).  
• Myocar dial infarction or symptoms of coronary artery disease (e.g. angina) in the last 2 years.  
• ACSM Cardiac Risk stratification of High Risk, unless confirmation of doctor that moderate exercise is 
appropriate.  
• Significant pain, metabolic,  or musculoskeletal di sorder that would contraindicate exercise . 
• MRI exclusions or claustrophobia 
• Any clinician prescribed activity restrictions  unless clearance is obtained for study  
• Anti-coagulant use  
 
 
 
b. Sources of Materials:   
Description of research materials : Magnetic resonance images , blood/genotype, and cognitive performance  will 
be the only material collected for analyses. Health information such as heal th/medical history, medication, and 
medical records  will be collected  with consent . Participant  data will b e coded, and only the study team  will have 
access to the codes. All data will be collected for this research study under conditions approved by [CONTACT_609167]. 
 
Management, analysis and protection of materials, including data management plan:  The study will be 
submitted for review to the KUMC IRB, and will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and HIPPA guidelines. Participants will provide written informed consent prior to entering the study.  All identifiable 
files, data, and tissue will be coded and stored in secure locations. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_609143]. The REDCap database system 
uses data validation and review algorithms to support data quality. There is no billing of participants, their 
families, or third party payers for the research assessments.  
 c. Potential risks:   
Moderate -Intensity Exercise:  Potential risks of the exercise stimulus as well as the exercise intervention 
include unpredictable changes in blood pressure or heart rhythm, myocardial infarction and death as well as the less serious problems of fatigue, muscle soreness, trippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], falli ng, and other injury to tendons, ligaments, 
joints, and muscles. This protocol requires effort well below maximal and is within standard exercise prescription for healthy adults. Risk is minimized by [CONTACT_609168] .  There is no statistical information regarding serious 
complications during exercise testing in patients without ischemic coronary heart disease.  A review of the 
experience of 30 cardiac rehabilitat ion programs reported information on 13,750 participants who accumulated 
1,629,634 patient hours of supervised exercise.  A total of 50 cardiac arrests were observed, 42 of which were successfully resuscitated while 8 were fatal. E vents are extremely rare,  and participants  will be screened for 
risk of cardiovascular disease and symptoms. Emergency equipment, including defibrillator, and ambulance 
plan are available for all participants .  
 
Neuroimaging:  MRI scanning is not generally ass ociated with any healt h risks. Trained technicians at the 
Hoglund Brain Imaging Center thoroughly screen all individuals before scans. Claustrophobia and non-
compatible implanted devices are listed as exclusion criteria. The confined space and loud noise can be 
uncomfortable. The study team will prepare the imaging table in advance and provide ear plugs to ensure 
comfort.  Blood draw:  Routine risks involving laboratory testing include minor pain, bruising, and swelling at the 
needle site, discomfort of hunger or thirst due to fas ting. Less likely is the possibility of lightheadedness, or 
even briefly feeling faint during the blood drawing procedure.  
 
Genotype. APOE e4 genotype data will be requested from the KU ADC (HSC #[ZIP_CODE]) for subjects who 
participate in the KU ADC Clinical Cohort or other studies that share this information back to the Clinical 
Cohort, and will be generated from all other participants. In some instances, we will also generate the genotype 
as part of this study. There is potential negative impact if this infor mation were to become known. Thus, this 
information will be stored electronically in a secure password protected REDCap database and any paper 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_609144] 
a secure badge- access file room at the KU CRC.  
 Adverse Events:  Adverse events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in study participants or 
others, which does not necessarily have to be a causal relationship with the study treatment. The seriousness 
of the adverse event will be determined using the National  Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0, and any adverse event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  Adverse events will be 
assessed only at the visit, but  the consent form will have contact [CONTACT_609169]. Serious Adverse Events will be reported per KUMC requirements.  
 Safety of the study will be monitored in an ongoing manner by a DSM C  according to the DSM C charter  
and Independent Safety Officer according to a Safety Plan.   
 
 
 
Adequacy of Protection Against Risk  
a. Recruitment and Informed Consent:  Recruitment occurs by [CONTACT_609170], public service announcements through media, physician referral , other KUMC 
recruitment sources , and word of mouth. We will also recruit from our pre -existing ADC coh ort of participants 
who have previously given consent to be contact[CONTACT_7678]. We are very sensitive to issues related to the participant ’s ability to understand the elements of consent and their capacity to make decisions . We 
employ a “teach- back” method to confirm understanding of the procedures . Initial screening consent will be 
acquired verbally over the phone. Written  informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or designated staff 
for the visit procedures , and the purposes of the study, its assessment procedures, and risks and benefits will 
be explained. The original signed consent form is kept with the participant ’s confidential file and a copy is given 
to the participant .  
 
b. Protection Against Risk:  All research data are maintained confidentially in password -protected  databases. 
All paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_609145]. 
Confidentiality is strictly safeguarded by [CONTACT_2373] -compliant standards .  
 Additionally, the following policies will be adopted to assure the safety of the participants in this study:  
1. Strict adherence to institutional regulations for conducting clinical research 
2. The involved support staff will be adequately trained to conduct  human research and will 
have completed the necessary institutional web- based training prior to the study  
3.  We will comply with HIPPA regulation and commit to maintaining the patient confidentiality.  
4. Any research presentations or publications from the proposed studies will not disclose any  
personal identity information . 
 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Participants and Others  
Others may benefit for the information gained from this research. In particular, research scientists and clinician s may be able to use the knowledge gained from this study because it will increase our understanding 
of AD etiology and potentially aid in the design of future therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
Society benefits from research advances i n aging and the maintenance of cognitive and brain health. This 
study will enhance our understanding of the role of cellular metabolism in promoting healthy brain aging. 
Potential benefits outweigh the risks of this research.

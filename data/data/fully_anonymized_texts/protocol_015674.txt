Title:   ACT I: Assessment of C ancer Related Brain Fog using the Test of Strategic Learning  
 
Short Title :  ACT I. 
 Rationale:  To determine the ability of the Test of Strategic Learning (TOSL) to detect cognitive 
impairment in people complaining of brain fog.  
 Objectives:  We hypothesize that we can recruit [ADDRESS_203694] high 
correlation  with PAOFI higher level cognition subscore.  The primary objectives are:  T ime to recruit 
the first 10 patients and the correlation of TOSL Synthesizing Summary score with PAOFI score at 
time 0 
 
Study Type:   This is a prospective observational cohort  
 Study Design:   [ADDRESS_203695] 5 years and who can operate a computer and read and 
understand English. 
 
Study Methodology:  Participants will complete the TOSL, the PAOFI, and the FACT -COG at 
enrollment and then 3 months later.  Completion can be done in person or on a computer.   
 Statistical Methodology: After the 1st 10 people we will pause to consider the recruitment rate and feasibility.   If we can recruit 10 people in 4 months (recruitment rate 2.5 people/month) that will be considered sufficient recruitment rate to proceed to the full study. If the recruitment rate and dropout rate are sufficient for completing the main study in the allotted time, we will proceed to stage 2, which is the full study. We will use a Spearman correlation coefficient to compare the TOSL subscales with the PAOFI subscales.  50 people will also give 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of [ADDRESS_203696] 0.4, at a significance level of 0.05.  Assuming 10 percent drop out, we will recruit 55 people.  
 
 
                                                                                                             
         
                                        
                           
INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1. Specific Aims  
Aim 1:  To demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting patients to a brain fog study at Inova 
Aim 2:  To correlate BHI gist reasoning and complex narrative memory domains with overall Patient 
Reported Outcome measures at baseline  
Aim 3: To correlate change in BHI gist reasoning and complex narrative memory domains with change 
in Patient Reported Outcome Measures  
 
1.2. Hypothesis  
We hypothesize that the Brain Health Index domains of gist reasoning and complex narrative memory 
will negatively correlate with higher cognitive subscale of the PAOFI and changes in BHI will negatively 
correlate with changes in the higher cognitive subscale of the PAOFI  
 
1.3. Background and Significance   
 
1.3.1.  BACKGROUND  
Breast cancer remains the most common cancer in women, with an estimated incidence of 2,261,[ADDRESS_203697] cancer in men is rare; in 2019 in the [LOCATION_002], less t han 1% of new 
breast cancer diagnosis occurred in men.  Cancer -related cognitive impairment (CRCI) in breast cancer 
patients, sometimes called “brain fog” is now a recognizable concern, and an important problem to address. In 
2018, 3.[ADDRESS_203698] cancer in the [LOCATION_002] and up to 75% experience 
CRCI.  CRCI in patients with breast cancer causes problems with attention, working memory, executive 
function linked to a region in the brain called the prefrontal cortex, as well as processing speed.  CRCI has a 
negative impact on quality of life (QOL) and detrimental effects on daily activities.     The etiology of CRCI is not yet well understood, it can be related to the disease or treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, 
radiation, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy.   
 Patient complaints of CRCI symptoms have been reported and documented mostly by [CONTACT_136494] -Assessments, 
directly from patients, and Patient -reported outcomes (PROs). One of the few formal neuropsychological tests 
that assesses a spectrum of cognitive abilities in breast cancer patients is the Patient’s Assessment of Own 
Functioning Inventory (PAOFI).  PROs have consistently documented brain fog. However, there is a lack of 
evidence of detec ted concordance between CRCI self- reported complaints and formal neuropsychological 
assessments that are currently being implemented. In addition, the specific attribution of PAOFI to 
standardized neurocognitive metrics is not well examined and understood.  Further, analyses the correlation of 
PAOFI to “objective” standardized neurocognitive assessments. The study also aims to examine the ability of 
standardized psychometrics to detect CRCI complaints, thus establishing a strong agreement between cognitive 
complaints and neuropsychological performance. 
 
1.3.2. B ACKGROUND ON PAOFI and FACT -COG  
 The Patient Assessment of Own Functioning Inventory (PAOFI) is a subjective measure of cognitive function. 
PAOFI is a widely used application in a diverse set of clinical population. The PAOFI was developed in 
reflection of commonly reported complaints and the cognitive domains typi[INVESTIGATOR_174399]. The PAOFI consists of 33 categories designed to assess the different aspects 
of cognitive function with the goal of capturing the diverse characteristics of self -assessed cognitive 
complaints. Categories are aggregated into four subscales: Higher Level Cognitive and Intellectual Functions (HLC) tappi[INVESTIGATOR_174400] (nine questions); Memory (ten questions); Language (nine questions); 
and Motor/Sensory- Perceptual (five questions).   Items are rated on a Likely scale from 1 (“almost always”) to 
6 (“almost never”). The scoring system involves summing only the items with high severity number  (i.e., 
scores of 1, 2, or 3) into a domain score. There have been limited studies evaluating the psychometric properties 
and reliability/validity of PAOFI.  To better understand its usefulness in this patient population, a study 
conducted by [CONTACT_174405]. examined the scaling structure, reliability, and construct validity of the PAOFI in 
breast cancer survivors. The study found that certain aspects of the assessment, such as the scoring method are 
not sensitive enough to detect the more subtle cognitive c hanges that are frequently reported by [CONTACT_174406].   
 
Self-reporting instruments have been widely administered across a diverse range of clinical settings. This 
approach has been regularly applied in experimental studies and is validated by [CONTACT_174407] a practical and 
effective method for collecting data (Van Dyk et al., 2017). The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -
Cognitive (FACT -Cog) is a certified method for identifying patients’ cancer -related cognitive impairments. 
FACT -Cog is a self -reported questionnaire designed for cancer patients to assess perceived cognitive function 
and its impact on quality of life (Costa et al., 2018). The FACT system was first developed in 1980 by [CONTACT_174408], a postdoctoral student in Memorial Sloan Can cer Center ( www.facit.org ). FACT has now become a 
licensed measurement system with many categories of assessments, one being the FACT -COG.  The FACT -
COG consists of 37 questions evaluating four different components of perceived cognitive function; perceived 
cognitive impairments (CogPCI: 20 items); perceived cognitive abilities (CogPCA: 9 items); comments from 
others (CogOth: 4 items); and the impact of perceived cognitive impairments on quality of life (CogQOL: 4 
items ). It is aimed at assessing patients’ memory, attention, concentration, language, and thinking skills and 
the impact of cognition disturbances on the quality of life. Participants’ rate the question based on how many 
times a given situation has occurred th e past week. This is constructed on a five- point scale, from never/not at 
all (0) to several times a day/very much (4).  The total FACT -Cog score is the sum of the four subscales and 
ranges from 0- 148. The higher the total score, the better the cognitive function, and the lower the impact on 
patients’ quality of life (Hajj et al. 2020, Costa et al. 2018).  Studies evaluating the FACT -Cog found 
appropriate construct validity for the total score of neuropsychological weaknesses in cancer patients and survivor s. The assessment has specific strengths in detecting signs of depression and anxiety rather than 
cognition function, such as memory. (Hajj et al. 2020) Thus in orders to detect cognitive dysfunction, suggestions have been made to refine the assessment. A recommended best approach is incorporating assessing 
cognitive abilities (Dyk et al., 2017). Others found the calculation structure uncertain, and a big consideration was tailored to future efforts focusing on scoring specific cognitive domains separately (Van Dyk et al., 2020). 
Overall, there are significant concerns in regard to the FACT- Cog lacking targeted subjective abilities.
 
 1.3.3.       BACKGROUND ON BHI  
 
The Brain Health Index (BHI) is a standardized performance benchmark that was developed by [CONTACT_174409].  BHI was designed to assess whole brain deterioration and help 
predict cognitive function. BHI has been successful in detecting cognitive decline in stroke patients 
significantly more ac curate than methods that were previously established.  This performance benchmark 
allows an effective observation of changes in key cognitive abilities over time. BHI includes various 
assessment domains that incorporate a series of written and verbal tasks , specifically targeting the frontal lobe. 
It aims at to determining the performance of critical frontal lobe processes, which are responsible for executive functions such as planning, decision making, and problem solving. 
 
An assessment domain of BHI call ed the Test of Strategic Learning (TOSL) measures gist reasoning, an 
assessment that directs participants to construct as many abstract ideas as possible from a lengthy text. The scoring is based on the number of abstract ideas the participants cultivated.   TOSL also includes a measurement 
of memory for text details called the Memory for Details. Participants are asked to recall specific details of the 
text used to assess gist. Previous studies have found that the gist reasoning test may be sensitive enough to 
help clinicians identify previously undedicated subtle cognitive changes that could explain the difficulties of daily life experienced by [CONTACT_174410]. This was found to be true in patients with 
traumatic brain injury. Gist reaso ning is also found to be a subsequently guide for appropriate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
The Visual Selective Learning Task (VSLT) is a selective learning task in which the participant’s ability to 
learn select information among other items is assessed (Hanten et al., 2 004; Hanten, Zhang, & Levin, 2002). 
Individuals are presented with multiple trials of single words, [ADDRESS_203699] SEL ECTION

STUDY METHODS AND PROCEDURES  
 
3.1. Setting/Location 
 
3.2.   Recruitment  
 
In close collaboration with ISCI breast clinical physicians ([CONTACT_174419], [CONTACT_174420], and [CONTACT_174421]) and breast surgery clinic ([CONTACT_174422]). CRC can also prescreen physician schedule and contact [CONTACT_174411]. 
The patient advocate will also assist in outreach efforts to community organizations. 
 
3.3. Study Treatment/Intervention  
 This is a non- interventional study.  
 At both time points, patients will be administered the TOSL, the PAOFI, and the FACT -COG. Testing will take 
approximately [ADDRESS_203703]:  
The VSLT will be administered to examine the ability  to filter low -value and select high value information. 
In the VSLT the examinee is presented with a series of words, one at a time. Some words are in all caps and some are in all lower case.  There are three rounds. In two of the rounds, words in all caps are valued at [ADDRESS_203704] of Strategic Learning:  
The Test of Strategic Learning (TOSL, Chapman, Gamino, & Cook, under review; S. Chapman, J. Hart, H. Levin, L. Cook, J. Gamine, unpublished data, 2009) will be adm inistered to examine the higher -order cognitive 
control function of gist reasoning (the ability to abstract novel integrative interpretations from complex 
information) and to examine memory for core details/facts.   
 The TOSL consists of a one -page text in the form of an expository, biographical narrative. The narrative is 
dense with details of the person’s life. Taken beyond the surface level, the texts contain multiple high- level 
themes that encapsulate the key concepts within the story. For example, one of the TOSL texts was about a man (John Pi[INVESTIGATOR_174401]’s) life and the eight jobs he attempted throughout his life in an effort to improve life for 
others (Chapman et al. 2002). The text also contained detailed information about the reasons for his failure in 
each career.  There are 3 different TOSL text narratives which can be used alternately: Malcolm Muggeridge, Sarah Hale, John Pi[INVESTIGATOR_91915]. One of the texts can be used at time point 1 and a different text can be used at 
time point 2 to minimize practice effects. 
 
 
The three components of the TOSL are:  
1) A high- level overview of the text.   
2) Life lessons or take- away messages that could be learned from the text (Interpretive statements)  
3) Detail -level questions about the text 
The first two components yield two measurements of the ability to use gist reasoning to abstract the central 
message and glean interpretations from complex information. The third component provides a measure of the 
ability to recall the important fact s/details.  
 Participants will be tested individually in a quiet room by a trained examiner. Before presenting the text, the examiner familiarizes participants with the task. The participants are informed: “ The text conveys a lot of high-
level meanings. Af ter reading the passage, I will first ask you to write a high-level overview. Then I will ask 
you to generate numerous lessons that can be learned. So be thinking about the bigger ideas as you read the 
text. Also, I will ask you some specific questions.”
 
 
Participants are then provided with a copy of the narrative text to read. Participants read the text silently. The 
participant is allowed to re -read the narrative and may underline or take notes if they desire, but they are 
informed they will not be allowe d to refer back to the text once they are done reading.  Upon completion, the text 
is removed from sight so that participants do not have the option to refer to it further. The participant is then 
asked to write a condensed version of the passage they just  read that includes as many high -level ideas as 
possible within a 6- minute time limit. They are instructed they do not need to include all of the details, but 
instead to write highlights that convey ideas of substance from the text. If participants begin making a list or 
writing down bullet points of information, they are cued to instead write down their ideas in the form of a 
paragraph. In addition to the abstracted overview/synopsis, to further assess the ability to abstract meaning, 
participants derive o ne-sentence interpretive statements from the text. The participant is next asked to write 
down as many lessons or take -home messages that can be gleaned from the information as he or she can 
think of within a 6 -minute time limit.  
 
Subsequently, the partic i pant is given the “memory for detail” recall measure of the TOSL, which entails a 
series of cued questions to assess recall of specific details from the complex narrative text that was used to 
assess gist reasoning. Participants are first asked a question  that requires listing key points from the text. 
They are then asked [ADDRESS_203705] asked to recall all the careers that John Pi[INVESTIGATOR_174402]. They are then asked cued questions to specify what 
happened in each of the 8 careers.  
 
The TOSL has a manualized objective scoring system in which written overviews/synopses conveying 
abstracted gist meanings receive a higher score than those that focused on the stated details of the text. 
Participants receive 1 point for each key thematic concept/abstracted idea conveyed in their overview of the 
text in their own words; verbatim or pa raphrased ideas receive no points. With regard to scoring the 
interpretive statements, concrete interpretations of the text that were directly tied to the explicit content also receive no points. Abstract interpretations that express a generalized takeaway  that can be inferred from the 
narrative and are stated in the client’s own words rather than via a cliché or rote saying receive 1 point. When 
scoring the “memory for detail’ recall measure of the TOSL, a cumulative score can range from [ADDRESS_203706] possible score. One point is given for each of the 8 
possible key points recalled. In addition, for each prompt to provide more specific detail about the key 
points, participants can receive a score from 0 to 2 points depending on the accuracy and completeness of the response. Participants receive 2 points for providing 2 or more details specific to the given prompt, 1 point 
for accurately capturing one detail, and no points for incorrectly recalled details.  For example, on the TOSL 
text about John Pi[INVESTIGATOR_174401], participants receive 1 point for each of the eight careers they recall and 2 points for giving a complete reason for each career’s failure, [ADDRESS_203707] reason.  
 Two trained raters independently score the TOSL overviews, interpretative statements, and responses to probes about their memory for details. Disagreements between raters are resolved through discussion and mutual 
consensus. The scoring  will be discussed with a clinician from the Center for BrainHealth at UT Dallas over 
telephone or video call, with no identifying patient information provided. Raters are blinded to the participants’ scores on the patient -reported outcome measures.  
 
Resp onses to detail -level questions about the text (TOSL Part 3) will be tape- recorded and later transcribed 
for verbatim scoring for all participants. Written responses will be elicited for the overviews/synopses and interpretive statements (TOSL Parts 1 and 2) for all participants except for those who are unable to write their 
responses due to physical constraints. For these participants, oral responses on these tasks will also be audio -
recorded and later transcribed for verbatim scoring. Participants will al so be asked to read aloud their written 
overviews/synopses and interpretive statements for audio- recording and later transcription if their handwriting is 
difficult to read. Audio recordings will be deleted after transcription.

be kept in a study binder. No study procedures will occur prior to obtaining informed consent.  
 
 
3.6.   Monitoring Subjects and Criteria for Withdrawal of Subjects from the Study.    
 
Subjects may voluntarily stop at any time.  
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS/DATA ANALYSIS  
 
4.1.   Sample Size   
 
Stage 1 (internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]): 
 
After the 1st 10 people we will pause to consider the recruitment rate and feasibility.   
 10 people with also give 80% confidence that we will encounter in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_174403] a probability of 15%. (Vichtbauer 2015)  
We will estimate the recruitment rate as 10 divided by [CONTACT_174413] 10 people.  For the 
full study to recruit 55 people in 18 months requires an average recruitment of 3 people per month.  If we can 
recruit 10 people in 4 months (recruitment rate 2.5 people/month) that will be considered sufficient 
recruitment rate to proceed to the full study.  
10 people will also allow an estimate of the dropout/noncompletion rate. If the observed dropout rate is 10%, 
a sample size of 1 0 people will provide an 80% two-sided confidence interval of 1 to 34%. 
 If the recruitment rate and dropout rate are sufficient for completing the main study in the allotted time, we 
will proceed to stage 2, which is the full study.  
 
Stage 2  
The TOSL less ons score is a numeric score from 0 to 10 that can then be split in quartiles.  In cognitively 
normal seniors, the mean score is 3.35 with SD 1.29.  The complex narrative memory subscale is a numeric 
score from 0 to 24.  In cognitively normal seniors, the mean score is 16.35 with SD 3.88. (Anand 2010) The 
PAOFI has [ADDRESS_203709] deviation 0.9.  The Higher Level Cognition subscore has a Spearman correlation of ~ 0.47- 0.[ADDRESS_203710] 95% confidence interval width of 0.33 or less, we need 50 people.  50 people will al so give ~85% power to reject 
the null hypothesis of [ADDRESS_203711] -COG will be scored using the version 3 scoring document ( https :
//www.facit.org/measures -scoring-
downloads/fact-cog- scoring-downloads ) without scoring the 4 items indicated as “NOT CURRENTLY 
SCORED.” 
 
Study participants’ VSLT score, TOSL score, the PAOFI score, FACT- COG score and their subscale score 
at baseline and follow -up will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, min, max, mean, median, SD).  
  
The following Spearman’s correlation coefficients will be calculated  
between the TOSL Lessons score/VSLT score and the PAOFI higher level cognition s ubscale score  
between the TOSL lessons score/VSLT score and the PAOFI total score, the FACT -COG cognitive 
impairment subscale score and total score  
between TOSL synthesizing summary score, TOSL memory for details score and the PAOFI higher level cognition score, PAOFI total score, FACT- COG cognitive impairments subscale score and total score at 
baseline.  
between the change (from baseline to follow -up assessments) in the VSLT score, TOSL Lessons score, 
synthesizing summary score, memory score and t he change (from baseline to follow -up assessments) in 
PAOFI total score, higher level cognition subscale score, the FACT -COG cognitive impairment subscale 
score and total score.  
 
4.2.   Data Storage   
 
4.2.1.  Data Management 
 
Information about patients will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Privacy and confidentiality of all patients 
enrolled must be maintained.     
Study data will be collected and managed using RE DCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Inova Health 
System. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web -based application designed to support 
data capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive interface for validated data ent ry; 2) audit trails for 
tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data 
downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources. 
 
The VSLT and TOSL will be admi nistered through Qualtrics hosted on the UT Dallas server.  This Qulatrics 
server is password protected and HIPAA compliant.  The subject records on that server will be coded by [CONTACT_12929], and the key will be kept at Inova in the REDCap EDC, so no identifiable information will 
be stored at UT Dallas.  
 
4.2.2.    Records Retention  
 
Data will be stored for three years following study completion and then destroyed. If data is used for future 
research and analysis, all identifiers will be removed.

4 RISK – BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
The potential risks and benefits of participation in this study are clearly identified in the  subject 
Informed Consent Form (ICF) and are the same as detailed in the LEVANT 2 Randomized 
protocol , reference section 4.1 – 4.3 of the LEVANT 2 Randomized protocol for complete  risk-
benefit analysis . 
 
4.1 EARLY  TERMINATION  
Lutonix, Inc. ( Sponsor ) and the Clinical Events Committee  will monitor the progression of the 
continuation access study.  If warranted, the study may be  suspended or discontinued  if there is 
an observation of seri ous adverse reactions presenting an unreasonable risk to the study 
population.  
 
The Sponsor may terminate Investigator and site participation in the study for issues including 
but not limited to the following issues:  
• Evidence of an Investigator’s failure to maintain adequate clinical standards  
• Evidence of an Investigator or staff’s failure to comply with the protocol  
• Inaccuracy or late submission of data forms and core lab images  
• Conditions of approval imposed by [CONTACT_3488]/EC and/or regulatory age ncies  
• Evidence of safety concerns or protocol non -compliance  
• Change of staff at s ite that adversely impacts study  conduct   
Any evident pattern of non -compliance with respect to these standards will be cause for the site 
to be put on probation.  If correct ive actions are not subsequently undertaken, the clinical site 
will be as ked to withdraw from the study and their site may be replaced . 
 
Notification of suspension or termination will occur no later than five (5) working days after the 
Sponsor  makes the de termination.  In the event of study suspension or termination, the Sponsor  
will send a report outlining the circumstances to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics 
Committee (EC), and all Investigator s and Regulatory Authorities as required by [CONTACT_157008].  A

26 March 2012  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 of 23 5.1 SCREENING  PROCEDURES  
For sites participating in the Randomized portion of the trial, enrollment in this registry will not 
start until the full randomized cohort (47 6 subjects) has been enrolled.  
All patients admitted for a percutaneous revascu larization of a femoropopliteal artery should be 
screened for study eligibility.  If inclusion criteria are met and no exclusion criteria are present at 
the time of screening, the patient should be entered into a study Screening Log.  Once the 
patient’s eligibility has been determined, the Investigator  will discuss the study and ask the 
patient to participate .  Prior to enrollment, the patient must sign the LEVANT 2 Continued 
Access informed consent form approved for use by [CONTACT_1201]/EC  or other appropriate committee.  
A copy of the signed and dated Informed Consent will be provided to the subject .  Subject s will 
be assured that they may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.   The 
background and purpose of the study , participation requirements,  as well as the potential benefits 
and risks of the procedure(s) must  be explained to the subject . 
 
If not already performed as standard practice, t he same  assessments and tests must be performed 
as listed in the m ost recently approved LEVANT 2 r andomized protocol after obtaining informed 
consent and prior to the index procedure (within 30 days unless otherwise noted ) to verify and 
complete eligibility.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_372899] s are expected to remain available (geographically stable) for the duration of the study 
follow -up period .  If any subject  moves away, every effort must be made to maintain the follow -
up schedule including having an appropriate physician follow the subject .  The Investigator  is 
responsible for ensuring that each follow -up visit occurs at the specified time and that all 
applicable data is reviewed and entered into the electronic case report form system (eCRF) in a 
timely fashion.  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_372900] undergo formal Moxy procedure proctoring with a 
sponsor representative (or designee) during their initial study Moxy case(s)  if it was not

• Baseline angiographic confirmation that the target lesion meets all appropriate 
inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Defined  pre-dilatation balloon inflation has begun.  
Subjects  that do not meet post -predilatation  criteria are enrolled  but treated per standard practice  
and followed for safety for [ADDRESS_372903] s with target lesions 
that, after baseline angiography , do not meet all inclusion/exclusio n criteria and are not pre -
dilated per protocol are considered screen failures  and will not be enrolled or treated with the 
Moxy Drug Coated Balloon in this  study.  
 
6.2 PRE -DILATATION  
Always refer to the current IFU packaged with the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon f or complete pre -
dilatation requirements.  
 
Lesion (s) pre-dilatation(s) is required for all patients.  The predilatation  balloon should be a 
standard PTA balloon inflated to a diameter approximately 1 mm less than the reference vessel 
diameter (RVD).  Always limit the longitudinal length of the pre -dilatation balloon to avoid 
creating a region of vessel injury that is outsi de the boundaries of the area to be treated by [CONTACT_304660] (i.e. geographical miss) .  In order to reduce dissections and potential 
subject allocation to the standard practice arm after pre -dilatation, careful and controlled pre -
dilatation (s) inflations should be performed and recorded  (on film) .  
 
See Table 2 for an overview of lesion assessment .  If, after pre -dilatation, the lesion sit e has a 
major flow -limiting dissection  or residual stenosis >70% , the subject will not be treated with the 
Moxy Drug Coated Balloon  but is instead treated per in stitutional standard practice.  S ubjects 
excluded  from treatment with the Moxy Drug Coated Ball oon after pre -dilatation will be 
followed for 30 days for safety and then withdrawn.

6.3 TREATMENT  
 
6.3.1 LUTONIX MOXY  DRUG COATED BALLOON   
Please refer to the current Moxy Drug Coated Balloon IFU for detailed information on device 
use. 
 
The Investigator should determine the appropriate size of the balloon to be used by [CONTACT_304661] 
(if possible) or by [CONTACT_13729].  The Moxy Drug Coated Balloon should extend at least [ADDRESS_372904]  TREATMENT  AND  PROVISIONAL  (BAILOUT)  STENTING  
PROCEDURES  
The rate of provisional (i.e. bailout) stenting in prior SFA clinical trials, including those 
investigating drug coated balloons , has varied considerably.  In particular, a discrepancy has 
been noted in bailout rates between control and treatment arms  in previous studies .  This 
discrepancy is likely attributable to investigator bias that the control arm is less likely to succeed 
and thus the threshold for stenting test -device treated subjects is lower.  There is no consensus or 
established objective criteria that are validated regarding the appropriate threshold for 
provisional SFA stenting.  In the absence of an established thresho ld, the determination to bailout 
has previously been based on criteria that are either subjective or largely left to the discretion of 
the individual operator and his/her judgment.  
 
The current study  design is intended to minimize the need for bailout stentin g.  Due to the need 
within the medical community to establish validated criteria for provisional stenting, this study  
will utilize more rigorous criteria for bailout st enting.  Specifically, the s tudy will employ the 
additional requirement of a pressure gradient measurement to document an unsatisfactory 
balloon -only outcome (obtained by [CONTACT_304662] 2 Continued Access Registry  
CL0002 -09  Revision 01  
26 March 2012  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 23 simultaneously).  The minimum pressure gradient threshold f or bailout stenting ( Table 3) has 
been established by [CONTACT_304663] a number of experts who have extensive experience with SFA 
intervention, some of whom utilize pressur e gradients routinely in their practices.  Requiring 
confirmation of a baseline pressure gradient prior to stenting establishes objective criteria that 
must be met for bailout stenting (and should reduce the rate in this study).  
 
TABLE 3: PROVISIONAL (BAILOUT ) CRITERIA  
Bailout Prevention  
 Treatment requirement prior to bailout stenting:  
• Prolonged (>2 minutes) balloon inflation(s)  
• Vasodilators and/or thrombolytic agents per investigator discretion  
Bailout Criteria  
• Residual stenosis of  >50%  (based on careful in -lab review of angiograms including 
QVA if available)  or  major flow -limiting dissection  (Record angiography in 2 
orthogonal views)  
and 
• Documented translesional pressure gradient of >20mmHg ( using ≤4F end -hole catheter) 
or >10mmHg (pressure wire)  measured immediately distal to the target lesion  
 
These criteria are set as the minimum  baseline pressure gradient requirement for allowing bailout 
stenting; however, bailout stenting is not required for pressures equal to or exceeding these 
thresholds (i.e. presence of a gradient at/above these thresholds does not require that the operator 
place a stent).  Rather, these thresholds are seen as minimum requirements for bailout stenting; 
below these thresholds, bailout stenting is not allowed . 
 
If the criteria for bailout stenting are fulfilled, placement of a bare nitinol stent approved by [CONTACT_304664].  T he physician should use the shortest stent possible to treat 
only the clinically significant dissection or residual stenosis and not the e ntire target lesion. 
Antiplatelet therapy should be prescribed per the stent manu facturer’s IFU . 
 
The angiographic core lab and study steering committee will be monitoring cases of bailout 
stenting throughout the course of the study  for compliance to provisional (bailout) criteria listed 
in this section.

7 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject.  This 
definition does not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the device 
under investigation.  See Appendix A  of the LEVANT [ADDRESS_372907] be reported to Lutonix or desig nee within 24 hours of knowledge .  All 
adverse events will be reported to the IRB/EC per local requirements.  
 
[ADDRESS_372908] s can withdraw from the study at any time  for any reason ; the reason for withdrawal will 
be documented.  All da ta available at the time of withdrawal (if any) will be used for analysis. 
There will be no further follow -up (per this study protocol) on the subject  who has withdrawn.   
If a visit is missed, the site is required to document a minimum of three (3) attemp ts to contact 
[CONTACT_304666] -up window.  If the subject only misses one protocol required visit, 
the site should repeat the three (3) attempts to contact [CONTACT_304667] a certified letter.  
When a subject misses two (2) consecutive follow -up visits with failure of all contact [CONTACT_14386], 
the subject may then be considered lost to follow up and exited from the study.  
 
9 DATA  COLL ECTION  AND  MONITORING  
 
9.1   DATA  COLLECTION  
The Investigator  (or designated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]) will assure primary data collection based on 
source -documente d hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174175] .  These documents will be completed in an expedited 
fashion.  
 
9.1.1 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS (ECRF)  
All required clinical data for this tria l will be collected in web -based standardized eCRF .  The 
same electronic data capture system and the same DCB treatment eCRF as in the LEVANT 2 
randomized protocol will be utilized  (minus those data points associated with items excluded in 
section 6.3) .  Clinical  trial data will be collected in accordance with the Guidance for Industry: 
Collection of Race and Ethnicity Data in Clinical Trials.  Subject  personal information should be 
LEV ANT [ADDRESS_372909]  information 
throughout the study.  
 
The eCRF is designed to accommodate the specific features of the study design.  Modification of 
the eCRF will only be made if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_304668] /or the appropriate regulatory 
body.   
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_372910] an initiation visit  or call  performed by a study team member prior to initiation  
of enrollment into the conti nuation access study .  This visit  or call  will ensure that the 
investigator understands his/her responsibility for conducting this study at his/her center.  This 
includes, but is not limited to, device accountability, protocol compliance, informed consent 
process, enrolling appropriate subjects, and IRB/EC submissions, approvals, and continuing 
reviews.  
 
Monitoring will be perform ed on  original medical records of all enrolled su bjects .  Sites will be 
monitored according to the approved monitoring plan.  M onitoring personnel will monitor for 
accuracy and timely submission of data forms and core lab images , and compliance with the 
study protocol, applicable regulations, the signed Investigator  Agreement and any conditions of 
approval imposed by [CONTACT_54232]/EC  and/or regulatory agencies.   Monitoring personnel 
will also confirm documentation of the informed consent process, missing visits or examinations, 
and the reason for any subject failing to complete the study.    
 
Any evident pattern of non -compliance with respect to these standards will be cause for the site 
to be put on probation.  If corrective actions are not subsequently undertaken, the clinical site 
will be asked to stop enrollment and complete outstanding fol low-up visits for subjects already 
enrolled at their site.   
 
LEV ANT [ADDRESS_372911] deficiencies .  Specifically, the Study Monitors will review:  
• Screening Procedures  
• Discontinuation of Treatment  
• Source Data  
• Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event Recording and Reporting  
• Investigational Device Reconcili ation  
• Study Data  and Core Lab Data Submission  
• Protocol Deviations  
At the close of the study at an investigational site, appropriately trained personnel appointed by 
[CONTACT_304669] a final on -site visit.  The purpose of this visit is to collect all outst anding 
study data documents, ensure that the Investigator 's files are accurate and complete, review 
record retention requirements with the Investigator , make a final accounting of all study supplies 
shipped to the Investigator , provide for appropriate disp osition of any remaining supplies, and 
ensure that all applicable requirements are met for the study.  The observations and actions made 
at this visit will be documented and communicated to the Investigator . 
 
9.3   SOURCE  DOCUMENTATION  
Auditors, monitors, medi cal IRB/ECs, the study Sponsor  and regulatory authorities may have 
access to the medical records related to this study .  Original or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_304657], observations, and other activities throughout the clinical investigatio n must be 
recorded and maintained in the medical file o f each enrolled subject .  (No source documentation 
will be recorded directly on a CRF) .  At a minimum, the following must be included in each 
subject ’s file:  
• Sufficient medical history and current phys ical condition, including any medication(s) 
the subject  is taking at the time of the procedure to assess the subject ’s eligibility;  
• The medical file should reveal the subject ’s participation in this study, including start 
and expected follow -up time;  
• Dated  report of the investigational procedure including medication, material usage, 
and complications, if applicable;

some of these records may be available in computerized form from the CRO, but the final 
responsibility for maintaining study records remains with the Investigator .  These include:  
• All correspondence with another Investigator , an IRB/EC , a Core Laboratory, 
Lutonix, a monitor, or regulatory agency, including required reports ; 
• Records of receipt, us e, or disposition of the investigational device, including receipt 
dates, serial and/or lot numbers, names of all persons who received or used the 
device, why and how many devices were returned to or otherwise disposed of.  
Device reconciliation logs shoul d be kept current and available to Lutonix and 
monitor upon request ; 
• Records of each subject 's case history,  source documents , evidence of informed 
consent, all re levant  observations of adverse study device  effects, the condition of 
each subject  upon enter ing and during the course of the investigation, re levant  
medical history, the results of all diagnostic testing, and the date of each study 
treatment ; 
• Screening  log, enrollment log, study personnel visit log; 
• Any other records that the regulations require to be maintained . 
 
9.5   STUDY  PROCESSING  
 
9.5.1  COMMUNICATION

[ADDRESS_372913] be stored in a locked storage facility to 
which only the Investigator  and/or designated study staff will have access .  The Investigator  is 
responsible for device accountability at the trial site .  The Investigator  may assign the 
respon sibility for the device accountability to an appropriate study staff member, but remains the 
final responsible person .  The Investigator  must ensure that the device is used only in accordance 
with the protocol  and current IFU .  The Investigator must  mainta in records that document device 
delivery to the trial site, the inventory at the site and administration to each subject .  These 
records must include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], and the unique 
code numbers assigned to the tri al subject s.  The Investigator  must  maintain records that 
adequately document which device  the subject  received according to the protocol and the 
assigned randomization .  In the case where a device has failed, the Investigator  must make every 
possible effort to return the device to Lutonix ; instructions for this procedure will be provided in 
the Manual of Operating Procedures.

The Steering Committee  (SC) and Clinical Events Committee will continue to function in the 
same manner as in the LEVANT 2 Randomized protocol.   
 
11.2  IRB/EC  APPROVAL  
Investigator s must submit th e study protocol to their IRB/EC  and obtain written approval before 
being allowed to conduct and participate in the continued access study.  Annual re -approval must 
also be obtained.  The Investigator  is also responsible for fulfilling any conditions of ap proval 
LEV ANT 2 Continued Access Registry  
CL0002 -09  Revision 01  
26 March 2012  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 23 imposed by [CONTACT_1201]/EC , such as regular safety reporting, study timing, etc.  The Investigator  will 
provide Lutonix or designee with copi[INVESTIGATOR_252473].  
 
Any amendments to the protocol, as well as possible associated information and  consent form 
changes, will be submitted to the IRB/EC  and written approval obtained prior to implementation.  
 
11.3   INFORMED  CONSENT  
Part of the IRB/EC approval must include approval of an Informed Consent Form (ICF) that is 
specific to the continued access study and approved by [CONTACT_304672].  The  Investigator  must administer this approved ICF to each prospective study 
subject , and obtain the subject 's signature [CONTACT_304674].  The ICF  
may be modified to suit the requirements of the individual site.  The Investigator  will provide 
Lutonix or designee with a copy of the approved ICF for his/her site.  Lutonix or designee must 
pre-approve each ICF prior to initial submission to the IRB/EC; major changes must be approved 
by [CONTACT_1622].  
 
The study must be explained in a language that is understandable to the subject  and he/she must 
be allowed sufficient time to decide whether to participate .  All subjec ts will be assured that they 
have the right to withdraw from the study at any time during the course of the protocol and this 
decision will not influence his/her relationship with the Investigator  (treating physician) and/or 
study staff.  
 
11.4   INVESTIGATOR’S  RESPONSIBILITIES  
Each  Investigator  is responsible for ensuring the investigation is conducted according to all 
signed agreements, the Investigational Plan and applicable laws and regulations .  The site 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_304658] -inves tigators at each site  and will maintain 
responsibility for oversight of all procedures and data collection.  All co -investigators must be 
trained on all aspects of the protocol prior to enrolling and performing procedures .  All 
interv entionalists performin g procedures must be trained as co -investigators in the study.  
The Investigator  may not begin enrollment  in the continued access study until Lutonix or 
designee receives appropriate IRB/EC approval and any other applicable document (revised 
investigator agreement, etc.)

efficacy information of the Lutonix Moxy  Drug Coated Balloon  for treatment of stenosis or 
occlusion of the femoral and popliteal arteries  in a large population of sub jects.  The LEVANT2 
Continued Access Study is an open -label registry study of the Drug Coated Balloon.  
 
Approximately 975 subjects will be enrolled in order to include a total of 650 subjects treated 
with the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon  after successful pred ilatation .  Subjects are considered 
enrolled in the study after being consented and the defined pre -dilatation balloon inflation has 
begun.  Based on angiographic results after predilatation, up to 1/[ADDRESS_372915] subjects  randomized to drug coated balloon .  
Allowing for up to 15% loss -to-follow -up, an evaluable sample size of [ADDRESS_372916] subjects is 
expected .  If the observed  rare adverse event rate is 1%, then the upper limit of the 95% 
Confidence Interval is 1.8%  (PASS2008: Exact Clopper -Pearson) .  Assuming an expected 1% 
incidence rate, Power is > 95% to observe  at least 4 unexpected SAEs  (PASS2008: Post -
Marketing Surveillance) .  Similarly, if the observed rate is 2%, then the upper limit of the 95% 
Confidence Interval is 3.0% .  Assuming an expected 2% incidence rate, Power is >  95% to 
observe  at least [ADDRESS_372917] and describe the 
rate of rare unant icipated adverse events with some precision.

adequate sampling of both US and non -US subjects.  
 
13.3   ANALYSIS   
Data from all the subjects treated with DCB in the LEVANT 2 Randomized protocol (roll -in and 
randomized to DCB) and in the LEVANT 2 Continued Access registry will be combined and 
analyzed using descriptive statistics .  To assess the consistency of results under different 
analyses, secondary as -treated (AT) and per -protocol (PP) analyses will be performed for the 
primary and secondary endpoints.  An additional supportive analysis of patients with and without 
bailout stenting will also be performed based on d escriptive statistics, and data will further be 
presented for PP analysis of subjects with and without bailout stenting.   Poolability by [CONTACT_304673] (LEVANT2 roll -ins, randomized subjects, and continued access subjects) will 
also be evaluat ed. 
 
In addition to the primary endpoint, all secondary endpoints will also be analyzed using 
descriptive statistics .

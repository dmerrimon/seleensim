Background/Significance  
The [LOCATION_002] is currently experiencing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_805959].[1] Along with mortality, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_805960], as well as a rise in ED visits and substance -abuse treatment 
admissions. [1, 2] Perioperative pain is often managed by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_2438] [3 -5]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_805961].[6] Commonly prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_805962], hydrocodone, and 
morphine. However, post surgical pain management with opi[INVESTIGATOR_805963]- term 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].[7,8] This prolonged opi[INVESTIGATOR_805964]- naive.[8] In addition, 
diversion of these opi[INVESTIGATOR_805965] a portion of the prescribed  medication  is 
taken; in fact, 67% of urologic patients had a surplus of opi[INVESTIGATOR_805966] a survey of 210 patients who underwent surgery.[9] Besides dependence and 
addiction, opi[INVESTIGATOR_805967], as well as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, ileus, and constipation.[6] As an alternative  to opi[INVESTIGATOR_805968],  non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_805969].[10] NSAIDs and acetaminophen are often utilized as alternatives to opi[INVESTIGATOR_83269], and have an increased efficacy when combined.[11] They both have been proven to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_805970] -induced adverse events.[12, 13] Non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], including 
ketorolac (Toradol) and acetaminophen (Tylenol), are often used alone or in combination with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_805971].[14] Ketorolac (Toradol) is an NSAID with strong analgesic activity that works by [CONTACT_244396], and provides similar pain relief to that of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]; the analgesic effect is slightly delayed but persists longer than that of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. It has 
been shown to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_805972] a decrease in opi[INVESTIGATOR_805973]:  2018 -9031

 events, shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], and a faster return to normal gastrointestinal function than that of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].[15] It does not alter gastric motility or adversely affect respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and it is not 
associated with abuse or addiction as opi[INVESTIGATOR_307533].[15] Common side effects of ketorolac include 
prolonged bleeding times, GI ulceration and hemorrhage, nephropathies, and allergic reactions.[15] Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a centrally acting analgesic that has been confirmed 
to be effective for acute pain, and has been shown to display opi[INVESTIGATOR_263067].[6] A 
common side effect of acetaminophen is hepatotoxicity.[6] In this randomized clinical trial, we intend to investigate pain outcomes after ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients who are treated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_805974] a non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_805975]. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy and ureteroscopy are minimally invasive 
surgical  techniques to surgically  remove kidney stones. This trial will seek to determine  whether 
non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_805976] 11-point numeric rating scale, in which [ADDRESS_1112598] will be checked to determine if the p atient underwent a routine history and physical, as well if 
pre-operative imaging such as a plain abdominal film, renal/bladder sonogram, or non- contrast 
enhanced CT was obtained. Additionally, the chart will be reviewed to determine if there was a pre-operative urinalysis and culture. Patients will then be randomized to control (opi[INVESTIGATOR_172664]) or non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_805977], and given this medication at discharge. Percocet 
(Oral, 5 mg tablet: 1 tablet every 4-6 hours, or as needed; 10 tablets prescribed) will be the medication for the opi[INVESTIGATOR_652868], and Acetaminophen (Oral; patient directed as needed and not prescribed) and Ketorolac (Oral, 10 mg tablet: 1 tablet every 6 hours, or as needed; 20 tablets 
prescribed)  will be the medications  for the non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_652868]. The plan for randomization will be 
to use a random number generator to allot subjects to opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_805978]. For all 
patients, we will record the age, sex, location of stone, stone burden (maximal diameter on CT 
scan), stone size, length of surgery, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and pain medications administered 
after the surgery  but prior to  discharge.  This  is a non- inferiority  trial in which  primary  outcomes 
are pain outcomes as measured by [CONTACT_805991]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_805979].  The patient  will be asked,  over telephone call,  to complete  a 
questionnaire rating their satisfaction with pain relief, current pain intensity level, worst and 
average pain intensity levels, and their belief of an acceptable pain intensity level since the surgical procedure; these will be measured on an 11-point ordinal scale.[16] The mean of these

 values  will be evaluated  as the main  analysis;  secondary analysis  will evaluate individual values. 
One week post-op, the patient will also be asked, via telephone call, about any adverse events 
experienced since the surgery, and how many medication pi[INVESTIGATOR_548390]. As a secondary 
outcome, rates  of constipation  and rates  of unused medications  by [CONTACT_805992]- call one 
week after the surgery will be measured. Patients will be considered to complete the study after 
the follow up phone call, which occurs one week postoperatively.

 analgesia utilized  after undergoing ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Patients  will 
be given all the available information regarding the risks and benefits of the type of analgesia, 
and they will be given the choice as to whether they would like to be enrolled in the study. 
Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_3462]. All consent will be obtained in the Urology clinic (Hutchinson clinic or preoperative clinic) at the patient’s regularly scheduled 
appointment once a patient  chooses to undergo ureteroscopy or percutaneous  nephrolithotomy. 
 
Risk/Benefit  
The risks associated with participation in the study include the known risk factors of 
ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy, as well as that of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], Ketorolac, and 
Acetaminophen  use. The known risk factors  for ureteroscopy  and percutaneous nephrolithotomy 
include infection, bleeding, ureteral damage or perforation, or injury to other organs. Common 
adverse events  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_805980], vomiting, nausea,  constipation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_36645], 
urinary retention, and physical dependence. Possible risks of Ketorolac include peptic ulcers, 
gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and volume 
depletion. A possible risks of acetaminophen is liver damage. Possible benefits to inclusion in 
the study include less opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-induced side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_805981]. Broader benefits of the study include identifying 
whether non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_805982]. Perioperative outcomes may allow future patients to be spared side effects and the possibility of physical dependence that comes with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Additionally, the greater use of non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_22395]-operatively can be a modulating factor in reducing the current widespread 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817]. 
 
Data Analysis  
Statistical Analysis  
Analysis will be based on the null hypothesis that there is no difference among opi[INVESTIGATOR_805983].  The alternate 
hypothesis is that there is a difference in regards to these [ADDRESS_1112600] (DSMB). The monitoring group will consist of three independent physicians in the 
Montefiore Urology department: [CONTACT_805996], [CONTACT_805997] and [CONTACT_805998]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_805984]. This report will also 
include an analysis of protocol deviations, violations and adverse events. 
IRB NUMBER:  2018 -9031

occur in the interim, but the research assistant will monitor the literature (via pubmed) on 
nonopi[INVESTIGATOR_805985]. 
 
Determination  of Sample  Size 
The primary outcome in this study will be pain intensity as measured by [CONTACT_805993].  Other  reported  randomized trials  measuring similar  outcomes utilized  a 
non-inferiority  margin  of 1.3. [17] Assuming a power  of 80% with  a 95% confidence interval,  as 
well as a standard  deviation of 2.6, each  arm must contain  51 patients  (total of 102) as  calculated 
using PASS Software. Assuming a 36% attrition rate, we will recruit 140 patients (70 for the opi[INVESTIGATOR_652868], 70 for the non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_652868]). 
 
Data  Quality  Control and Database Management  
All data will be kept on a secured, password- protected server that only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_805986]. All data will be entered  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_805987].  Data will be 
submitted in a de-identified manner (without name, MRN, zip code, or date of birth) to the DSMB  to ensure quality  of data e ntry on a monthly basis.  Data collected  for analysis  will contain 
only de-identified patient information. The identifier log will only be able to be accessed by 
[CONTACT_40221]. Once all patient data is collected and the study is over for three 
years, all patient identifiers will be removed from the database.

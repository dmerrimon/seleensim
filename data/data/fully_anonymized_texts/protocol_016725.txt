CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 2 of 137VERSION HISTORY
Version 4, 20 September 2021
Version 4 is a substantial amendment to the Clinical Study Protocol (CSP). The purpose of 
the substantial amendment is to inform of a d ecision to hold further study recruitment, 
remove the interim analysis, and remove a treatment arm (24 mg verinurad in combin ation 
with allopurinol) that was previously planned to  be included (CSP version 3). There was a 
decision taken to hold recruitment at the original number of patients targeted for the interim analysis, i.e. reducing the sample size from n=435 to approximately 150 patients. This smaller sample size is considered to be enough for the evaluation of the primary efficacy objective, and the interim analysis is no longer needed. The reduction of the sample size and the removal of the treatment arm were not based on safety concerns, and the safety profile remains unchanged. Should results indicate a need for a larger study, as was originally 
planned, the CSP may be amended to restart recruitment, understanding the potential 
limitations of the added data.
The substantial changes and all other changes in this amendment are summarised below.

A Phase 2, Mult icentre, Double -Blind, Pl acebo and Act ive Control Efficacy and Safet y Study  
to Eval uate Verinurad combined with Allopurino l in Heart Failure with Preserved Eject ion 
Fract ion
Short title:AMETHYST
Rationale
Evidence shows independent associat ions between hyperuricaemia and the risk of cardio -renal 
condi tions, including heart failure (HF) ( Anker et al 2003 , Grayson et al 2011, Ko dama et al  
2009, Levya et al 1998, Nakagawa et al 2006 ). Serum uric acid (sUA) is also a strong 
prognosti c factor and correl ates wi th other m arkers of poor prognosis in HF patients with 
preserved eject ion fraction (HFpEF), and an est imated 1/2 -2/[ADDRESS_634427] 
hyperuricaemia 
(Odden et al 2014, Pal azzuo li et al 2017 ). Uri c acid transporter 1 (URAT1) is 
responsible for reabsorption of uric acid (UA) in the proximal tubule. Inhibit ion of URAT1 
resul ts in increased urinary excretion of UA. Verinurad is a novel URAT1 inhibitor in Phase 2 
development for chronic kidney di sease (CKD) and HF. Verinurad combined with the 
xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors (XOI) febuxostat or allopurino l has been shown to lower 
sUA in pat ients with recurrent gout in Phase 2 studies by [CONTACT_422906] 82% . HFpEF i s 
a microvascular disease lik ely partly driven by  [CONTACT_493198]. Uric acid crystals have been identified in coronary  vessel walls in so me 
hyperuricaemic patients 
(Andrés et al 2016, Park et al 2014 ). The primary aim o f this Phase 2 
study  is to eval uate the effects of substant ial UA lowering on functional endpo ints in 
hyperuricaemic HFpEF patients, using a combinat ion of verinurad and allopurino l.

Overall design
A randomised, multicentre, global, double-bli nd, parallel arm, active- and placebo-controlled, 
Phase 2 study to assess safety and efficacy of 12 mg verinurad and 300 mg all opurinol on 
functional endpoints in patients with hyperuricaemia (sUA > 6 mg/dL) and HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥45%). Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be 
randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to verinurad/ allopurinol combinatio n, allopurinol, or placebo.
There will be matching placebo for both the verinurad and allopurinol. The verinurad placebo 
will be iden tical in appearance to verinurad and likewise the allopurinol p lacebo to 
allopurinol.CCI

Data Monitoring Committee
The Data Monitoring Co mmit tee (DMC) will be responsible for monitoring the safet y of the 
study  patients and making appropriate recommendations based on the available data. The 
DMC will funct ion independent ly of all other individuals associated with the conduct of the 
study , including A straZeneca (AZ). The committee will operate in accordance with a DMC 
Charter.
Adjudication committee
The study  will engage an independent clinical event adjudication (CEA) committee to 
independent ly review, interpret and adjudicate potent ial CV events that are experienced by [CONTACT_493200].
Statistical methods
The primary  endpoint is absol ute change from  baseline in peak VO 2at Week 32 and will be 
analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model wit h change from baseline in 
peak VO 2at Week [ADDRESS_634434] ive of whether the patient has discontinued study treatment or received other 
medicat ions. Mi ssing peak VO 2values at Week 32 will be imputed using a dropout reason-
based mult iple imputation approach.
The key secondary  endpoint is change from  baseline to Week 32 in KCCQ- TSS and will be 
analysed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) m odel.
The primary  and secondary  object ives will be analysed using the Full analysis set.
Clinical Study Protocol [COMPANY_008]
D5496C00005 [ADDRESS_634435] sequence will be used for the confirmatory analysis of the primary and 
secondary objectives in order to address the issue of multiple testing. Statistical significance will be assessed in the following sequence:
!Comparison between verinurad + allopurinol and placebo in change from baseline in peak 
VO
2at Week 32
!Comparison between verinurad + allopurinol and allopurinol monotherapy in change
from baseline in peak VO 2at Week 32

KCCQ-TSS at Week 32
!Comparison between verinurad + allopurinol and allopurinol monotherapy in change 
from baseline in KCCQ-TSS at Week 32
The testing procedure will continue down the hierarchy if the preceding endpoint is rejected at 
a two-sided 0.05 level and will stop if the preceding endpoint is not rejected at a two-sided 0.05 level.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 34of 1372 INTRODUCTION
2.1 Study Rationale
Chronic HF (CHF) isa maj orcause of mortali ty,hospi [INVESTIGATOR_493171] y of life. Even 
with the best possible treatment, the five-year survival  rate f or HF pati ents i s worse than for 
most cancers ( Braunwald 2015 ). Moreover, the prevalence for CHF continues to increase 
globally . An est imated [ADDRESS_634436] e are affected worldwide ( Braunwald 2015) with over 
1 millio n hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493172] ( Ambrosy et al 2014 ). The 
annual glo bal economic burden in 2012 was estimated to be $108 billio n (Cook et al 2014);  
this will increase dramat ically as the populat ion ages.
HF is characterised by[CONTACT_103433], fatigue, and pulmo nary congest ion and/or 
peripheral oedema due to fluid retention. Patients with sign s and symptom s of HF 
arecategori sed, based on measurement of LVEF, as having HF wit h reduced LVEF (HFrEF) 
or HF wi th preserved LVEF (HFpEF). Approximately half of all HF pat ients have HFpEF 
(Oktay  et al  2013 ). The ri sk of death for HFpEF patients i s high, wi than annualised mortalit y 
rate up to 15% in co mmunit y settings ( Lam et al  2011 ). Pati ents wi thHFpEF have a 
particularly significant unmet medical need given that outcome studies hitherto performed 
have not resulted in any  approved pharm acotherapy specifically  for thi s condi tion. 
Conversely , outcom e studi es have provided evidence for treatments for HFrEF that can 
improve symptoms and haemodynamics and reduce hospi [INVESTIGATOR_493173] y. 
These treatm ents include diuret ics, angiotensin convert ing enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), 
angiotensin II receptor bl ockers (ARB), ARB neprilysin inhibitors, mineralocortico id receptor 
antagonists, and beta -blockers ( Iwaz et al 2016 )
.
Serum  UA is a strong prognosti c factor and correlates with other markers of poor 
prognosis in HFpEF pat ients. An estimated 1/2- 2/[ADDRESS_634437] hyperuricaemia 
(Odden et al 2014, Palazzuo li et al 2017) . Evidence shows independent associat ions between 
hyperuricaemia and the risk of hypertensio n, myo cardi al infarct ion, CKD, ty pe 2 di abetes, HF, 
and metabo lic syndrome, including obesit y (Nakagawa et al  2006 , Grayson et al 2011, 
Kodama et al  2009 , Levya et al 1998, Anker et al 2003 ).
A recent prospective crossover trial suggested that HFpEF parameters improved in pat ients 
treated with UA- lowering therapy  (Ogino et al  2019 ). The exact mechanism by [CONTACT_493201] -
lowering therapy  may improve HFpEF remains to be established, but the presence of 
proinflammatory  UA crystals in cardiac vessel walls ( Andrés et al 2016) m ay contribute to 
endothelial dysfunct ion, a hallmark of HFpEF. Uric aci d-lowering therapy  has been proven to 
improve endothelial function, albeit not tested to date in subjects with HFpEF (SURPHER 
study  presented by [CONTACT_493202] [ EULAR] 2019, data is 
in agreement with data from previous study  with allopurinol  in NYHA II/III subjects 
inTousoulis et al 
(Tousoulis et al 2011 )).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 35 of 137URAT1 is responsible for reabsorption of UA in the proximal tubule. Inhibition of 
URAT1 results in increased urinary excretion of UA. Verinurad is a novel URAT1 inhibitor in Phase 2 development for CKD and HF. Verinurad combined with the XOIs febuxostat or allopurinol has been shown to lower sUA in patien ts with recurrent gout in Phase 2 studies by 
[CONTACT_422906] 82% (see Investigator’s Brochure [IB], Section 5.2.1).
The purpose of this Phase [ADDRESS_634438] of a combination of verinurad and 
allopurinol on exercise capacity and well-being in patients with HFpEF.  
 
Monotherapy with potent URAT1 inhibitors has been associated with creatinine elevation in 
some patients, potentially related to increased peak concentrations of urinary UA (uUA) in the 
proximal tubuli of the kidney. Verinurad is theref ore given as an extended release formulation 
(ER8), as a low maximum concentration is expected to further reduce the risk of creatinine elevations. More importantly, verinurad is to be developed exclusively in a fixed-dose combination with an XOI, which will also reduce the production of UA. Treatment with 
verinurad combined with allopurinol or febuxostat has not been associated with an increased incidence of creatinine elevations compared to placebo in the studies conducted to date (see IB, Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
The clinical evidence to date suggests that the combination of verinurad and allopurinol has an 
acceptable safety profile across multiple patient populations, and there may be a therapeutic 
benefit associated with UA-lowering therapy in HFpEF. Hence, a global, randomised, Phase 2 study is planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of verinurad and allopurinol in patients with HFpEF and hyperuricaemia.
2.2 Background
Verinurad is a novel URAT1 inhibitor in Phase 2 development. Verinurad combined with the XOI allopurinol has been shown to lower sUA by > 70% in patients with recurrent gout in Phase 2 studies. A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of verinurad is provided in the IB.

Study RDEA3170-206 was a Phase 2a, randomised, open-label, multicentre study to assess 
the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and safety of verinurad administered in combination with allopurinol (300 mg qd) compared with allopurinol administered alone 
(300 mg once daily, 300 mg twice daily, or 600 mg  once daily) in adu lt patients with gout. 
There were 40 male patients and 1 female patient randomised into the study. Serum UA was CCI

verinurad ranging from 2.5 to 20 mg given as the MR4 tablet in combina tion wi th allopurinol  
300mg. All verinurad and allopurino l 300mg combinat ion treatments resulted in greater 
reducti ons in sUA compared with allopurino l 300mg dosed al one.
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
More detailed informat ion about the known and expected ben efits and ri sks and safet y profile 
of verinurad may be found in the IB.
The study  design aims to minimise potential risks to patients and to ensure adequate 
monitoring. A dual -inhibit ion approach using lower doses of two agents with complementary  
mechanisms of act ion is expected to synergist ically improve efficacy  outcom es while reducing 
potenti al safety  issues that would be of concern with higher doses of each agent alone.
The m ain toxici ty of concern noted with verinurad mo notherapy  is creatinine elevat ions 
>1.5× baseline occurring in 6.2% of Caucasian patients in Study RDEA3170 -201, and in 
17.1% of Japanese pat ients in Study  RDEA3170- 203. When verinurad was combined wit h a 
XOI in Studies RDEA3170 -204, RDEA3170- 205 and RDEA3170 -206, no creatinine
elevations were reported. In the current study , verinurad will therefore exclusively be 
administered in combinat ion with allopurinol . In the Phase 2a study  D5495C00007, in which 
patients wi th diabetes and albuminuria were recruited, the combinat ion of ver inurad and 
febuxostat resulted in two creatinine elevat ion events in both the active treatment group and in 
the placebo control group.
The cumulat ive safet y data observed in the clinical studies conducted in the verinurad clinical 
development programme ind icate that verinurad in combination wit h allopurino l is generally  
well tolerated.
Patients wi th HFpEF are at increased risk to experience CV events. Furthermore, major CV 
events (MACE) have been ident ified as a potential risk for lesinurad, which is an app roved 
drug wi th a similar mechanism of act ion as verinurad. The overall incidence of MACE in the 
lesinurad programme was low, with comparable rates for lesinurad 200 mg in co mbinat ion 
with an XOI and an XOI alone. The rate was also low, but numerically hig her, with lesinurad 
400 m g; however, no causal relationship has been established. The small number of MACE 
observed in the pooled analysis o f data from  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_493174] -associ ated differences in MACE risk and a post-
approval  prospective observat ional cohort study  is planned to further evaluate this risk. There 
is no evidence of a CV safet y signal in the verinurad clinical programme to date. Important 
actions aiming to minimise th e CV risk to patients in this study  include using allopurino l 
instead of febuxostat, as allopurino l treatm ent is associ ated wi th a lower risk of CV death 
(White et al 2018 ). Also, high- risk patients such as patients with recent CV events or 
Clinical Study Protocol [COMPANY_008]
D5496C00005 [ADDRESS_634439] ions, will be minimised by [CONTACT_493203] -risk human l eukocy te ant igen-B (HLA -B) *58:01 allele and by [CONTACT_2329] a low 
starting dose and slow dose titration of allopurino l.
Patients wi th gout m ay experience an acu te gout flare event with init iation of UA -lowering 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014] (Borstad et al 2004 ). To prevent thi s, the manufacturer’s prescribing information for 
UA-lowering therapi [INVESTIGATOR_493175], allopurino l and febuxostat, as well as the EULAR, 
American Co llege of Rheumatology, and Brit ish Societ y of Rheumatol ogy treatment 
guidelines ( Jordan et al  2007 , Khanna et al 2012, Zhang et al 2006) recommend acute gout 
flare prophyla xis with co lchicine, steroi ds, or a nonsteroidal ant i-inflammatory drug (NSAID) 
when init iating or increasing the dose of such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Thus, to prevent increased 
inflammat ion due to rapi d cry stal dissol ution, and to reduce the risk of HFpEF exacerbat ion
due to an inflammatory  state, col chicine prophylaxis will be given during the titration period 
(8 weeks) and during the first 4 weeks of treatment at target dose (12 weeks total). Colchicine 
will be administered in all three treatm entgroups to ensure any difference in effect is not due 
to col chicine therapy . 
There i s a significant unmet medical need for HFpEF patients with hyperuricaemia as there 
are currently no available pharmaco logical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_493176]. Preliminary  evidence suggests verinurad combined with allopurinol may  dem onstrate 
a meaningful benefit, but it cannot be assumed that recruited patients will derive any benefit 
from the treatm ent administered.
To further safeguard the interests of the pati ents, a DMC will be established. Refer to Section 
9.4.[ADDRESS_634440] been carefully considered in light of the 
target patient populat ion. The potential benefit s of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new treatment for HFpEF 
with hyperuri caemia therefore outweigh the limited risks to the patients exposed to treatment 
with verinur ad and allopurino l in this tri al.

4.[ADDRESS_634443] of substantial UA lowering on 
functional endpoints in hyperuricaemic HFpEF patients, using a combination of verinurad and allopurinol for 24 weeks, plus 8 weeks titration. The study w ill be a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo- and active-controlled study.
Since the URAT1 inhibitor verinurad plus a XOI such as febuxostat or allopurinol can lower 
sUA up to approximately 82%, the crystals formed due  to high levels of UA are likely to be 
dissolved, which in turn is believed to lead to better clinical outcomes in HFpEF.
The duration of the study was set to approximately 8 months since microcrystals are expected 
to dissolve and hence inflammation to be redu ced within that time. An 8-week titration was 
chosen for the safety of allopurinol. Colchicin e prophylaxis will be used to prevent 
inflammation due to microcrystal dissolution.
4.2.1 Main Inclusion Criteria Rationale
In a study by [CONTACT_493204] (Palazzuoli et al 2017)  where hyperuricaemia was defined as ≥6 
mg/dL in women and ≥7 mg/dL in men, the results showed that the non-hyperuricaemic 
HFpEF group showed a statistically significant difference in the outcome of HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493177] [ADDRESS_634444] a strong rationale for adjusting sUA levels for gender, the current study will CCI

with a meaningful  benefi t.
Since the primary  endpoint is peak VO 2, a NYHA cl ass II -III has been chosen. Class I was 
excluded since a benefit will be difficult to demonstrate since the class I patients by  [CONTACT_493205]. Class IV pati ents are excluded since they  will 
probably  not be able to perform the CPET.
An NT -proBNP level o f ≥125 pg/mL for patients without ongoing atrial fibrillat ion/flutter, 
and ≥250 pg/m L for pati ents wi th ongoing atrial fibrillat ion or fl utter, wi th the al ternat ive of 
docum ented pulm onary capi[INVESTIGATOR_493178] > 15 or pulmo nary capi[INVESTIGATOR_493179] > 20 , was chosen according to the European Societ y of 
Cardi ology criteria (Ponikowski  et al  2016 ) because of good sensit ivity and specificit y for 
ident ificat ion of HFpEF ( Ho et al  2019 ).
As there is current ly no consensus wit hin academia or industry , a LVEF of ≥45% was chosen 
as the definit ion of HFpEF for this trial. Patients who had a known history of a documented 
LVEF < 40% will be excluded from the stud y to enrich for patients with HFpEF -dominant 
disease.
4.2.[ADDRESS_634445] to other methods to assess 
exercise capacit y (eg, [ADDRESS_634446]), CPET enables quant ificat ion of the effort the 
patient has applied during the test.
Patients wi th HF experience debilitat ing symptom s that substant ially impact daily  functioning, 
physical capacit y and quali ty of life. For these reasons, it is important to measure the impact 
of new HF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_493180]’s symptoms and funct ioning ( Zanna d et al  2013 ). The 
KCCQ instrument quant ifies both the frequency of four cardinal HF symptoms (fatigue, 
peripheral  oedema, dy spnoea, and orthopnoea) and how distressing are three of the cardinal 
HF sympt oms (fatigue, peripheral oedema and dyspnoea). The KCCQ also assesses HF -
related physical limitat ions, soci al limi tations, self -efficacy , and heal th-related quali ty of life. 
First devel oped in 1996 ( Green et al 2000 , Spertus et al 2005), over the fo llowing two decades 
experience wit h the KCCQ has grown in industry -sponsored and academ ic studies and it is 
now the most commo n disease patient -reported outcome (PRO) instrument collected in HF 
studi es.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 47of 1374.3 Justification for Dose
The verinurad and allopurino l combinat ion therapy doses and regimen selected for this study 
are based on the well -established dose -response relationship between verinurad in 
combinat ion with allopurinol  and sUA. The suggested verinurad dose (12 mg) was chosen 
based on PK, pharmacodynamic, and safet y data from  previ ous studi es in heal thy volunteers 
and Phase 2 studies in patients with gout or hy peruri caemia with albuminuria.
Verinurad combined wit h allopurino l (300 m g once daily ) dose -dependently lowered sUA 
from 47% up to 74% at verinurad doses of 2.5 to 20 mg (given as the MR4 tablet) in pat ients 
with recurrent gout ( Fleischmann et al  2018a ). A dose of 20 m g of the MR4 tabl et is 
equivalent to 12 mg of the ER8 capsule used in this study . Allopurinol  alone given as 300 mg 
once daily  lowered sUA by  40% in the same study. All doses tested in the study  were 
considered tolerable and safe. Hence verinurad [ADDRESS_634447] ill 
being known to be safe and tolerable in earlier studies.
Verinurad monotherapy  dose -dependent ly increases peak uUA excret ion (Hall et al 2018 ), but 
peak uUA excret ion is comparable to or lower than before any treatment when verinurad is 
given in co mbinat ion with an appropriately  dosed XOI ( Fleischmann et al  2018a , Fleischmann 
et al 2018b ). Verinurad i s therefore combined with allopurino l [ADDRESS_634448] ions. The starting dose of allopurino l will be 100 mg once daily , titrated up to 
200 m g once daily, and finally  titrated to 300 m g once daily , the target dose, which is in line 
with guideline recommendat ions for treatm ent of  gout and recent literature ( Khanna et al 
2012, Stamp et al 2016 , Richette et al  2017 ) . Verinurad will be titrated along wit h allopurino l.

Each patient will be randomised to receive 12mg verinurad plus 300 mg allopurino l, 300 m g 
allopurino l,or placebo for 24 weeks at target dose after 8 weeks of titration (Table 4).
Titration will occur in discrete steps of [ADDRESS_634466] 4 weeks of treatment 
at target dose (12 weeks total) and will be distributed as available, current ly 500 μg within the 
EU and 600 μg within the US. For dosing, see the below dosing schedule 
(Table 4). The 
allopurino l/placebo tablet and verinurad/placebo capsule(s) will be taken orally together once
daily . 
Study  treatm ents will  be titrated in discrete steps as shown in Table 4.Titration steps will be 
spaced at 4 -week (28 days ± 3 days) intervals to minimise the risk of adverse rea ctions to 
allopurino l. Patients unable to tolerate the stepped dosage may be down -titrated only by

Only patients enrolled in the study  may receive study  treatm ent and only authorised site staff 
may supply  or administer study  treatm ent. All  study  treatm ents m ust be stored in a sec ure, 
environmentally  controlled, and m onitored (m anual  or autom ated) area i n accordance with the

Further gui dance and information for the final disposit ion of unused study  treatment are 
provi ded in the Pharmacy Manual.
6.3 Measures to Minimise Bias: Randomisation and Blinding
All patients will be centrally assigned to randomised study  treatm ent using an interactive web 
response system (IWRS ). Randomisat ion to study  treatm ent will be performed in balanced 
blocks to ensure approximate balance between the three treatm entgroups verinurad plus 
allopurino l, allopurinol  alone,or placebo (1:1:1) . The randomisat ion codes will be co mputer 
generated and loaded into the IWRS database. Before the study is init iated, the l og-in 
inform ation and di rections for the IWRS will be provided to each site.
The IWRS system should ensure that a baseline peak VO 2 measurement is available for the 
patient before randomisat ion is allowed.
If a patient withdraws fro m the study , then his/her enrolment/randomisat ion code cannot be 
reused. Withdrawn pat ients will not be replaced.
The IWRS will provide to the Invest igator(s) or pharmacists the kit ident ificat ion number to 
be allocated to the pat ient at the dispensing visit. Routines for this will be described in the 
IWRS user manual that will be provided to each centre. For patients who need down titration, 
the Invest igator will need to use the IWRS for allo cation of  new study  drug ki ts for the l ower 
dose.
Every  effort shoul d be taken to discuss the decisio n related to down ti tration wi th AZ Study  
Physician prior to IWRS allocat ion of new study  drug ki t.
The rando misat ion code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the 
appropriate management of the patient requires knowledge o f the treatment rando misat ion. 
The Investigator documents and reports the action to AZ, without revealing the treatment 
given to patient to the AZ staff.
AZ retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be 
causally  related to a study  treatment and that potentially  require expedi ted reporti ng to 
regul atory  authori ties. Rando misat ion codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of 
data until all decisio ns on the eval uabili ty of the data from  each individual pat ient have been 
made and documented.

Treatment compliance: The pat ient will be asked about compliance at each study  visit starting 
from Visit 3 onwards. When study  medicat ion is returned, compliance will be assessed based 
upon pati ent’s interview and a count of the tablets retur ned. Compliance should be between 
≥80% and ≤120% of that prescribed. Patients judged to be non- compliant m ay continue in the 
study , but shoul d be counselled on the importance of taking their study  medicat ion and 
applicable ancillary  medicati ons as prescrib ed. The invest igator (or designee) will record the 
amounts of study  medicat ion dispensed and returned at each visit as described inTable SoA
andTable 1, as well as document reasons for non -compliance in the source document. The 
dates of all study  medicat ion dosing, including interruptions, missed doses, or overdose, must 
be recorded on the eCRF. The ad ministration of all study drugs (including invest igational 
products and colchicine prophylaxis) should be recorded in the appropriate sections o f the 
CRF as well as any change fro m the dosing schedule, dose interruptions, dose reductions, dose 
discontinuat ions. Each time study  drug/col chicine prophylaxis are dispensed, compliance will 
be reinforced. If any pat ient found to be non -compliant, he/she will be counselled on the 
importance of taking their IP/colchicine as prescribed.

time frame defined in the SoA.
8.1 Efficacy Assessments
Primary and secondary efficacy assessments include peak VO 2as assessed during CPET and 
patient-reported outcomes as assessed using the KCCQ (Total Symptom Score domain).
8.1.[ADDRESS_634478] Outcomes
CPET will be used to assess the change fro m baseline at Week 32 in peak VO 2consumpt ion 
(primary  objective). In addi tion, the fo llowing parameters will be assessed: Change from  
baseline in vent ilatory effic iency  as m easured by V E/VCO2
VO 2at anaerobic thresho ld
VO 2kinet ics at recovery  phase
Exercise time
All patients will undergo a CPET with gas -exchange analysis. The methodology  will be 
standardised across all part icipating sites, as described in the CPET Manual. Testing will 
include cont inuous ECG monitoring by [CONTACT_493215]. The primary  modali ty for exercise tests will be 
either a m otor- driven treadmill or cy cle ergom eter. Patients must use the same testing 
modality and the same exercise equipment for all exercise tests during the study .
Whenever possible, CPET should be administered by [CONTACT_493216][INVESTIGATOR_13959] o f equipment and performed after the other study procedures on that visit day (including 
PROs, NYHA class, acute coronary  syndrom e signs and symptom s, vital signs, ECG, bl ood 
sampling, study  treatm ent administration). Patients naïve to exercise protocols (cy cle 
ergom eter, treadmill, and measuremen t of oxygen consumpti on) will be familiarised wit h the 
technique during screening. All CPETs will be symptom -limited and patients will be strongly 
encouraged to perform a maximum test as indicated by  a RER ≥1.05. Pati ents will be eligible 
for the study  ifthey achieve a RER of ≥ 1.05. Eligible subjects must also have impaired peak 
VO 2. Peak VO 2achieved must be ≤75% of  predicted for age and gender when using a

device; paper quest ionnair es are not allowed in this study .
Each site must allocate the responsibilit y for the administrati on of  the PROs to a specific site 
personnel and, if possible, assign a backup person to cover if that individual is absent. A key  
aspect of study  success is to have high PRO compliance. Therefo re, it is essent ial that site 
personnel fo llow the
 SoA and ensure that the device is charged and set up properly  before the 
first pati ent com es for PRO baseline visit (Visit 3) in order to minimise missing data.
If pat ients have any medical problems, they  shoul d discuss them wit h their doctor or research 
nurse separately fro m the PRO assessment.
The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind patients there are no right or wrong 
answers and that the value and relevance of PRO data is to hear direct ly from patients, wi thout 
interpretati on from heal th care professio nals or others, how they  function and feel.
The fo llowing best practice guidelines should be followed:
The PRO questionna ires must be com pleted before any  other study  procedures are 
conducted, including being seen by  [CONTACT_3170]. 
The appointed site personnel must show patients how to use the electronic PRO device, in 
accordance with the instructions provided.
To avoi d bias, patients must not receive help fro m relatives, friends or site staff to answer 
or to cl arify the PRO questi onnaires.
The PRO questionnaires must be completed by  [CONTACT_103454].
The patient should be given enough time to complete the PRO questionnaires at his or her 
own speed.
On co mpletion of the questionnaires, the tablet should be handed back to the designated 
responsible person, who should check that all questionnaires, relevant for the specific 
visit ( SoA), were com pleted. If any  PRO questi onnai re was not completed, the si te

The following PROs will be used in this study:
!KCCQ
!PGIS
!PGIC
It will take approximately 10 -15 minutes to complete.
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire
The KCCQ (Appendix G)  is a 23-item, self-administered  disease-specific instrument that has 
shown to be a valid, reliable and responsive measure for patients with HF ( Green et al 2000,  
Spertus et al 2005) .
The KCCQ was developed to measure the patients’ perception of their health status 
independently, which includes HF-related symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), impact on physical and social function, self -efficacy and knowledge, and how the patients’ HF 
affects their quality of life. Scores are transformed to a range of 0 to 100. Higher scores represent a better outcome.
The 23 items in KCCQ can be merged into 10 summary scores. In this study, the KCCQ-Total 
Symptom Score (TSS), KCCQ-Clinical Summary Score (CSS) and KCCQ-Overall Summary Score (OSS) will be used.
Patient global impression of change
The PGIC (Appendix H)  item is one question and assesses how a patient perceives his or her 
overall change in HF symptoms since the start of the study. Patients will choose from 7 response options, ranging from ‘much worse’ to ‘much better.’
Patient global impression of severity
The PGIS (Appendix I)  item is one question and assesses how a patient perceives his or her 
overall current severity of HF symptoms. Pa tients will choose from 6 response options, 
ranging from ‘no symptoms’ to ‘very severe.’

events that meet the definit ion of an AE or SAE. For informat ion on how to fo llow/up AEs 
refer to Section 8.3.3 .
8.3.1 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal quest ioning of the patient is the preferred m ethod to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.
8.3.[ADDRESS_634486] igator learns o f any SAE, including a death, at any  time after a pati ent’s l ast visi t 
and he/she considers the event to be reasonab ly related to the Study  treatm ent or study  
participat ion, the invest igator may notify the sponsor.
The m ethod of recording, evaluat ing, and assessing causalit y of AE and SAE and the 
procedures for complet ing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix B.
8.3.3 Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
After the init ial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively fo lloweach pat ient 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs will be fo llowed unt il reso lution, stabilisat ion, the event 
is otherwi se explained or the patient is lost to follo w-up.

ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessa ry.
8.3.4 Adverse Event Data Collection
The fo llowing variables will be collected for each AE:

Date of discharge
Probable cause of death
Date of death
Autopsy  performed
Causalit y assessment in relat ion to Study  procedure(s)
Causalit y assessment to other medicat ion
8.3.5 Causality Collection
The Investi gator will assess causal relat ionship between Study  treatm ent and each AE, and
answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consider that there is a reasonable possibilit y that 
the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_415564]?’
For SAEs, causal relationship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures. 
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any  study  procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is foun d in Appendix Bto the CSP.
8.3.6 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_72992]: ‘Have y ou had any heal th probl ems since the previous visit/y ou were 
last asked?’ or revealed by [CONTACT_493221]. When 
collect ing AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (w hen possible) to recording a list of 
signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms 
Clinical Study Protocol [COMPANY_008]
D5496C00005 20 September 2021
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 75 of 137that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.
8.3.7 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests
The results from the CSP mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the clinical study report (CSR). Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory value or vital signs should therefore onl y be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the 
SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinua tion of treatment with the study treatment.
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE  and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting Investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
8.3.8 Hy’s Law
Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN may need 
to be reported as SAEs. Refer to  Appendix E for further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.
 
 
 
8.3.10 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_11012] a SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulato ry requirements relating to safety reporting 
to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC and investigators.
For all studies except those u tilising medical devices investigator safety reports must be 
prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory
requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.CCI

8.9 Guidelines, Study Assessments, and Procedures During 
COVID-19 Pandemic
In view of the ongoing and emerging novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spreading 
worldwide, the safety and well-being of our study  participants is of primary importance. To 
protect the safety and well-being of study participants, this section will provide guidelines on 
study assessments and procedures during this period.
1 Every effort should be made to follow the clin ical study protocol (CSP). Participant safety 
is paramount, and the investigator should continue to reassess the risk/benefit of continued study involvement for each study participant.

they should follow the local area treatment and quarantine guidance.
(a) Please accurately document all diagnoses, procedures, assessments, dosing 
interruptions, and sequ elae in the eCRFs. All AEs/SAEs should be reported in line 
with instructions for safety reporting documented in the CSP.
(b) Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection with moderate to severe 
symptoms may be at risk of dehydration or hypoxia. In case of such events the PI [INVESTIGATOR_493188]. 
(c) If a COVID-19 AE/SAE is reported, the investigator should determine whether the 
participant’s investigational product should continue, be interrupted, or stopped.
4 If a study participant is unable to attend clinic visits, and/or receive study intervention, the 
site staff should keep in close contact [CONTACT_230188](s), preferably through 
telephone calls, to maintain awareness of their status.
5 If a patient cannot be seen on site, please consider the following options:
(a) Conducting the visits in the patient’s home by [CONTACT_493223]. In addition, third party ve ndor personnel may be utilised to conduct 
assessments.CCI

transported between site and patient. The collection and analysis of safety blood samples at an alternative healthcare facility s hould be c onsidered. Local lab results 
will not be collected or stored in the study database but will help the investigator to assess patient safety.
(c) Visits 4, 5 and 6 may be conducted in th e patient’s home if site is closed or local 
regulations prohibit patients from travelling to site due to COVID-19. Safety laboratory tests are required.  
(d) If labs collected for safety assessments cannot be collected the IP should be 
temporarily interrupted. With the absence of safety labs as described in the above case, IP will not be dispensed. However, if it is interrupted for greater than one month, the investigator should discuss with the Study Physician how to re-start 
treatment and titrate the IP to maintenance treatment.
(e) Visits by [CONTACT_493224]’s house might  be performed solely due to COVID-[ADDRESS_634497] to be performed at the site.

To assess effect of verinurad + allopurinol compared to placebo and compared to allopurinol monotherapy on KCCQ-TSS.No difference in mean change from baseline at 32 
weeks in KCCQ total symptom score between treatment groups
9.2 Sample Size Determination
The study will employ a 1:1:1 randomisation ratio between 12 mg verinurad + allopurinol, 
allopurinol, and placebo. Based on this design with 50 patients randomised to the verinurad + allopurinol group and to the place bo group, respectively, and assuming a standard deviation 
for the primary endpoint of 2 mL/kg/min, the width of 95% confidence intervals for estimated differences between treatments will be about 1.57 ml/kg/min. The minimum detectable 
treatment difference for statist ical signif icance in a two-group t-test with a two-sided 
significance level of 5% given the a ssumptions above is 0.794 mL/kg/min. 
The assumed standard deviation of 2 mL/kg/min is derived from Borlaug (Borlaug et al 2018)  
and from Redfield ( Redfield et al 2013) .
For approximately 3 × 50 = 150 patients to be  randomised, up to 500 patients should be 
screened, matching an assumed proportion of screening failures of up to 65%.
9.3 Populations for Analyses
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined:
Table 8 Analysis Populations
Analysis set Description
Enrolled All patients who sign the main ICF
Full Analysis Set (FAS) All patients who have been randomised to study treatment, irrespective of 
their protocol adherence and continued participation in the study.
Patients will be analysed according to their randomised study treatment 
assignment, irrespective of the treatment actually received.
The FAS will be considered the primary analysis set for the primary and 
secondary variables  CCI
Clinical Study Protocol [COMPANY_008]
D5496C00005 [ADDRESS_634499] ical analysis plan ( SAP) for the analyses to be included in the CSR will 
be developed and finalised before the final d ata base lock. This section is a summary of the 
planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints. Any deviations from this plan will be reported in the CSR.
9.4.1 Efficacy Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of the Primary Objective
The primary efficacy variable for the analysis of  the primary objective is the absolute change 
from baseline in peak VO 2at Week 32, calculated as the value at Week [ADDRESS_634500] before randomisation.
The analysis will include data from all patients at Week 32 irrespective of whether the patient 
has discontinued study drug or received other medications. Missing peak VO 2values at 
Week 32 will be imputed using a dropout reason-based multiple imputation approach; missing 
data in the verinurad + allopurinol group  following the intercurrent events death, withdrawal 
of consent, loss to follow-up or premature disc ontinuation of study drug due to an AE will be 
imputed based on the peak VO 2 values in the p lacebo group wh ereas missing values for all 
other patients will be imputed assuming missing at random, ie, based on the peak VO 2 values 
in their own respective treatment group.CCI

causal relat ionship with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and 
unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest 
pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medi cinal  product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. 
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may  occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout peri ods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
B 2 Definitions of Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study  phase ( ie, run-in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -subject hospi [INVESTIGATOR_103421] 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty
Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may require medical 
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Adverse Events (AEs) for malignant tumours reported during a study  shoul d generally  be 
assessed as Serious AEs. If no othe r seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Important Medical Event’ 
criterion shoul d be used. In certain situat ions, however, medical judgement on an individual 
event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant tumour event should be assessed 
and reporte d as a non -serious AE. For example, if the tumour is included as medical history 
and progression occurs during the study , but the progressi on does not change treatment and/or 
prognosi s of the m alignant tum our, the AE m ay not fulfilthe attributes for being assessed as 
Serious, al though reporting of the progression of the malignant tumouras an AE is valid and 
shoul d occur. Al so, som e types of  malignant tum ours, whi ch do not spread remotely after a 
routi ne treatm ent that does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913], may be assessed as non -serious; 
examples include Stage 1 basal cell carcino ma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer removed via 
cone biopsy.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 101of 137B 3 Life Threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
subject’s death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not m ean that had an AE occurred in a more severe

operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AE s if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
B [ADDRESS_634524] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone

Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm

B 7 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possi bility’that an AE m ay have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the subject actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wi th known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experien ce. Di d the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_122570]?
No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_73011], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally reco mmend or support a re -
challenge.
Laboratory  tests. A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recognised feature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidenc e for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general
, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient informat ion in the 
case, i t is likely  that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.

D5496C00005 [ADDRESS_634525] shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
B 8 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in
the treatment process for an AZ study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the participant or has the 
potenti al to cause harm  to the parti cipant. 
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the d rug is in control of the study  site staff or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error. 
occurred
was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
did not occur, but circumstances were recognise that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  given to 
the participant
Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet 
Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature 
Wrong participant received the medicat ion (excluding IWRS errors)
Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IWRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IWRS -including those which lead to one of the above 
listed events that would otherwise have been a medicat ion error 
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Parti cipant fa iled to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging
Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in 
open l abel studi es, even if an AZ product

C 1 Chain of Custody of Biological Samples
A full chain o f custody  is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The Investigator at each centre keeps full traceability  of collected biological sam ples f rom the 
patients while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate).
The sample receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples while in storage and during use unt il 
used or disposed of or until further shipme nt and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.
[COMPANY_008] will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, 
monitoring of study  sites, audi ting or process checks, and contractual requirements of external 
laboratory  provi ders
Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AZ- assigned bi obanks and will be 
registered by  [CONTACT_493230].
If required, AZ will ensure that remaining bio logical  samples are returned to the site according 
to local regulat ions or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner.
C 2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples 
If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical samples, the sam ples will  be 
disposed of/destroy ed, an d the acti on documented. If samples are already analysed ,AZ is not 
obliged to destroy  the resul ts of this research.
As collect ion of the bio logical sample(s) i s an integral  part of the study , then the pati ent is 
withdrawn from  further study  parti cipat ion.
The Investigator:
Ensures pat ients’ withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
notified immediately to AZ
Ensures that bio logical samples from that patient, if stored at the study  site, are 
immediately  identified, disposed of /destroy ed, and the action documented
Ensures the organisation(s) ho lding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn 
consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroy ed, the acti on docum ented 
and the signed document returned to the study  site
Ensur es that the pati ent and AZ are informed about the sample disposal

and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
E 1 Introduction
This Appendix describe s the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) cases and Hy’s Law (HL) cases. It is not intended to be a 
comprehensive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries. 
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry . The Investi gator i s responsible for determining whether a patient meets 
potenti al PHL cri teria at any  point duri ng the study.
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate fo r the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other vi sits including central  and all 
local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visit s; for exam ple, PHL 
criteria coul d be m et by [CONTACT_96724]  a central  laboratory  and/or elevated TBL fro m 
a local laboratory . 
The Investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate 
elevations in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events.
The Investigato r participates, together with AZ clinical project representatives, in review and 
assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria are met. 
HL cri teria are m et if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver 
biochemistry  other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_415564]. 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs) according to t he 
outcom e of the review and assessment in line wit h standard safet y reporting processes.
E 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3× Upper Limit of 
Norm al (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥2× ULN at any  point during the study

same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
E 3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perfor m a com prehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who m eets any  of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
ALT ≥3× ULN
AST ≥3× ULN
TBL ≥2× ULN
Central laboratories being used:
When a pat ient meets any of the PHL identificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in co mbinat ion, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to AZ 
representative). 
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the PHL 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
Notify  the AZ representative
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_244994]
Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  CRF m odule(s) with the ori ginal  local 
laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (refer to Section 2 within this Appendix
for definit ion) by [CONTACT_309583] (including both 
central  and l ocal laboratory  resul ts)
Local laboratories being used:
The Investigator will wit hout delay review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will:
Notify  the AZ representative
Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (refer to Section 2 Definit ions wi thin 
this Appendix for definit ion) by [CONTACT_244995] m all previous visit s

E 4 Follow -up
E4.1 Potential Hy’s Law criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
Inform  the AZ representative that the patient has not met PHL criteria
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided in 
the Clinical Study  Protocol
E4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investi gator will:
Notify  the AZ representative who will then inform the central Study  Team .
Within [ADDRESS_634529] igator will report the case as an SAE of 
Potenti al Hy’s Law; seri ous cri teria ‘Im portant m edical event’ and causalit y assessment 
‘yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
For pati ents that m et PHL cri teria prior to starting study  treatm ent, the investigator is not 
requi red to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change# in the patient’s 
condi tion.
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach fo r the study  patients’ follow-up (including any  further l aboratory  testing) and 
the continuous review o f data.
Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_73016]:
Moni tor the pati ent until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and si gns return to norm al or baseline levels, or as l ong as m edically 
indicated. Completes fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician. This includes deciding which the tests available 
in the Hy’s law lab kit should be used.
Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available. 
# A ‘significant’ change in the pat ient’s condit ion refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in iso lation or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the Invest igator, thi s 
may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 114of 137E 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by [CONTACT_493231], to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorities within [ADDRESS_634530] and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternat ive explanatio n is an AE will be made and 
subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/ SAE: update the previously submitted Potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE CRFs accordingly wit h the new information (reassessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the study  treatm ent:
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AZ standard processes. 
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious criteria 
apply
Asthere is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned
If there is an unavo idable delay o f over 15 cal endar days in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then i t is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to study  
treatm ent and seri ousness cri teria is m edically important, according to CSP process for 
SAE reporting.

whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and 
amending the reported term if an alternati ve explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.

nephro lithiasis (eg, flank pain or haematuria), he/she should be evaluated by  a physician, and 
serum  creat inine, blood urea nitrogen, and urinalysis should be measured via central 
laboratory  testing (preferred) a nd/or l ocal laboratory  testing, as appropri ate, to determine renal 
funct ion. Imaging (intravenous urogram, renal ultrasound, or MRI) is recommended to 
confirm or exclude any urinary tract calculus. Abnormal result s should be treated as medically 
appropriat e by [CONTACT_1963]. All symptoms, testing, and results will be documented 
in source documents and the CRF.
If a patient develops a urinary  tract calcul us (as confi rmed and documented by  [CONTACT_493232] o f a stone) at any  time during the study , the pati ent will discont inue rando mised study  
medicat ion and be encouraged to remain in the study  for continued safet y assessments. If the 
urinary  tract calculus is passed, it should be collected and submitted to path ology  for analysis 
of chemical  com position.
F2Deterioration of Renal Function
This study  will have at l east 2 pre-dose serum creatinine measurements. The (higher) of all 
creatinine measurements collected before rando misation will be considered the baseline serum 
creatinine for renal safet y monitoring.
This study  enro ls pat ients with chronic kidney  disease (CKD). These patients may have 
changes in serum creat inine and est imated glo merular filtration rate (eGFR) that may be due 
to vari ous causes such as: deterioration of renal funct ion due to the underlying cause of CKD, 
volume depletion, hypotensio n, intercurrent medical condit ions such as worsening heart 
failure, concomitant drugs that alter renal tubular creatinine secret ion or reabsorption, or 
change in glo merular filtration rate via haemodyna mic effects. 
The CKD- EPI f ormula (Levey et al) should be used to estimate GFR for enrolment criteria, 
baseline value and subsequent on -study  measurements.
The Investigator should assess each patient carefully to determine the most likely cause for the 
det
erioration of renal funct ion. Fo llowing a thorough assessment, the patient should be 
managed according to local medical pract ice. Potent ially-treatabl e causes such as volume

F 2.1 Patients With Baseline eGFR ≥40 m L/min/1.73 m2
F 2.1.1 Serum Creatinine Increase to ≥ 1.5-fold From Baseline
Assess the patient to ident ify and manage any potent ial contribut ing factor. Correct any 
dehydrat ion and ensure the patient is well  hydrated pri or to next renal  safet y monitoring 
visit.
At the Invest igator’s discret ion, the patient may cont inue with study treatment, and retest 
of serum  creat inine should be performed the fo llowing week. If the underlying cause (eg, 
dehyd ration) is still present at the next evaluat ion, the Invest igator should carefully 
consider if the retesting should be postponed for another week.
Patient shoul d attend the fo llowing week for repeat serum creatinine measurement. If an 
underlying potentiall y treatabl e cause (eg, dehy dration) is still present, the Invest igator 
shoul d treat thi s appropri ately and postpone testing for up to a week. 
Subsequent management will depend on the repeat measurement(s):
If serum creatinine < 1.5-fold of baseline value for two successive measurements, the 
patient may  restart/continue with study  treatm ent and the original study  visit 
schedule.
If repeat serum creatinine is between ≥1.5 to < 2.0-fold of baseline value, the patient 
shoul d be evaluated every  [ADDRESS_634533] igator’s discretion. 
If serum creatinine is < 1.5-fold of baseline value during the evaluat ion peri od, study

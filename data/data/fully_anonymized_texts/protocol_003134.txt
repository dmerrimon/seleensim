Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_892217] places on the face to show signs of aging, in the 
form of lateral canthal lines or Crow’s Feet. Genetic differences and environmental 
toxins, predominantly ultraviolet light exposure and cigarette smoking, may alter  the rate 
of this normal aging process2. 
 
Over the past two decades, there has been increasing demand for aesthetic procedures 
to reverse the effects of aging, particularly in the facial area, and treatment of Crow's 
Feet is among the most frequent of cor rective treatment requests. A number of 
techniques have been developed to meet the increasing demand for aesthetic 
procedures to reverse the signs of aging . The se include:  incisional and excisional  
surgery, various resurfacing procedures, and the use of temporary or semi -permanent , 
injectable dermal fillers such as allogeneic or xenogeneic collagen, hyaluronic acid, and 
autologous fat cells. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l agents, such as r etinoic acids, glycolic acids  and lactic 
acids, are other common methods to minimize Crow’s Feet and other facial wrinkles.   
 
Injection of botulinum  toxin type A (BoNT A) is now one of the most common  aesthetic 
procedures performed  and there is a considerable body of medical literature 
demonstrating its safety  and efficacy in aesthetic indications3. On a molecular level, 
botulinum  toxin prevents the release of preformed mediators, such as acetylcholine, 
from motor nerve endings leading to a flaccid paralysis.  
 
BoNTA  is an effective treatment for Crow’s Feet  and is associated with high subject 
satisfaction . However, the treatment re quires multiple injections  into a well innervated, 
sensitive area that is prone to bleeding and bruising and close to delicate organs  such 
as the eyes  and lachrymal glands . In addition, misplacement of injection can lead to 
unwanted effects in non -target a reas. Therefore, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_177490], avoiding the discomforts and potential side effects of 
injections, would be highly desirable.

The treatment area  will be preconditioned with  AdminStamp  900. ET-01 will be applied 
immediately after pre -conditioning.  
3.3 Efficacy Parameters  and Timing  
Efficacy will be assessed using the Crow’s Feet Wrinkle Scale (CFW), which is a 
published validated, photo -numeric guide that grades severity of lateral canthal lines 
into one of the five categories of 0=none, 1=mi nimal , 2=mild, 3= moderate, and 
4=severe. (see  Appendix  A for details). Using the same scale, assessments will be 
made by [CONTACT_17588], t he investigator (IGA) and the subjects (SSA). Assessments are made 
“static” to avoid recall bias.

In general, the treatment region begins on the bony rim of the orbit, extending laterally 
to approximately one centimeter from the exterior edge of the hairline, 1 - 1.5 cm above 
and 1.5 – 2 cm below a horizontal line emanating from the lateral canthus to the 
hairline. This area of application is illustrated by [CONTACT_177510][INVESTIGATOR_50615]:

Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_892223]’s treatment. In no case, however, should 
ET-01 ever be applied within the area circumscribed by [CONTACT_661509]. 
 
The clinical investigator will wipe the periorbital region with an alcohol wipe and then dry 
thoroughly with a cotton swab. The treatment area will be pre -conditioned by [CONTACT_661510] , applying approximately 3 -4 pounds of pressure, to the skin. The 
location of the areas of pre -conditioning are illustrated by [CONTACT_661511] 2. 
There will be three (3)  impressions made along the bony rim of  the orbital cavity and 
one (1) impression  distal and inferior to the horizontal mid -line. After all four impressions 
have been made, the micro -needle array will be rotated by [CONTACT_3450] 90 ° and the 
process is repeated.   
 
Immediately thereafter, u sing a gloved finger, the investigator will massage [ADDRESS_892224] will be positioned on an examination table or 
fully reclined examination chair such that his/her temple will slightly slant backwards and 
to the side, directing any run -off away from the eyes and into the hairline. The subject 
will be instructed to close his/her eyes which will then be covered with eye covers, e.g., 
IPL-Aid™ Disposable Eye Shields, and an absorbent paper or cloth.  
 
There are [ADDRESS_892225] Article

Phase 2: Creaming  the sample becomes more viscous, is white in color, and 
sticky.  
Phase 3: Absorption  the sample becomes clear in color and has  a glossy smooth 
finish. There is no visible residue left on the skin after 
absorption.  
 
The process of treatment application will take at least  5 -10 minutes  each  and may, in 
some cases, take up to 15 mins to complete for each periorbital region . This pro cedure 
will be completed when there is no liquid visible on the surface of the skin.

6.1.9  Study Exit / Early Termination  
The scheduled Study Exit is at Week 26. However, if a subject should discontinue 
prematurely, the following will be performed in addit ion to the procedures scheduled for 
the patient’s terminating visit:  
 
• collect non -fasting blood samples for laboratory safety testing  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_892240] the investigator or may be called in for additional unscheduled 
visits due to safety reasons or at the discretion of the investigator or Sponsor. All 
unscheduled visits will describe the reason for the visit in the  electronic  Case Report 
Form. Some of the procedures that may be completed at an Unscheduled Study Visit 
are as f ollows:  
 
• Review of adverse events and concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• Collection of  blood samples for laboratory safety testing  
• Urine pregnancy testing  
 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_892241]  will participate for up to 26 weeks. There will be a (Qualifying) Baseline 
Visit on Week  0 and seven  in-office visits at Week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 , and 26. 
7.3 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_177500] a sequential, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_42970], dose -escalation trial. 
Enrollment will be halted after each cohort until a safety review has been completed.  
 
• Enrollment will be halted in the event that one serious adverse event  (SAE) , 
considered to be probably or d efinitely related to the administration of study 
medication, is observed.  
 
• Enrollment will be halted in the event that one AE is observed considered to be 
indicative of distant spread of study medication or unintended exposure to other 
beings.  
 
• The Sponsor may stop the study in its entirety or discontinue individual study 
center s at its discretion for any reason or, e.g. if it is observed that the protocol or 
sound clinical practices are not being followed, or for any other reasons.  
 
The study protocol calls for only one single application of study medication at Baseline 
(Week 0) . Since there is no continuous treatment, no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_661505] 26. 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_892242] s will be queried with regards t o concomitant medication at all study visits.  
 
8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Adverse event reporting will be handled in accordance with the IRB requirements and 
the requirements of other regulatory authorities that may apply, e.g. the Food and Drug 
Administratio n. 
 
Adverse Events reporting will be solicited by [CONTACT_105] -leading "How Do You Feel" questions. 
Subtle symptoms of local or systemic spread of toxin effect would be unlikely to be 
recognized by [CONTACT_177517]. Therefore, study participants  will be 
asked if they experienced weakness, lethargy, or difficulty swallowing or breathing. In 
addition, information derived from change in concomitant medications, laboratory 
analyses, and clinical observations will be evaluated for possible indications  for side 
effects. Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses or reactions to concurrent 
medications will also be recorded. The Investigator must monitor the condition of the 
subject throughout the study from the time of obtaining informed consent until the final 
study visit.  
 
Any adverse event, including both observed and volunteered problems, complaints, and 
symptoms, will be recorded on the Adverse Event page s of the electronic Case Report 
Form. When an adverse event occurs, the following information and assessments 
should be recorded in the adverse event section of the eCRF:  
 
• The signs, symptoms or diagnosis or the event,  
• The date and time of onset of the event using the 24 -hour clock where midnight is 
00:00 and noon is 12:00. Onset is the date when the first sign or symptoms were 
first noted.  
• Date of recovery/ resolution  
• The adverse event severity/ intensity using the criteria outlined in Section 8.1.2  
• The relationship of the event to the study drug as outlined in Section 8.1.1   
• Any other actions required  such as therapy, medication, treatment or diagnostic 
procedure  
• Seriousness of the event using the criteria outlined in Section 8.1.3  
• Outcome (recovered, recovered with sequelae, not yet recovered, death)  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_892243] should be conducted until resolution of the adverse event or until 
the medical condition is stable. The investigator is responsibl e for the appropriate 
medical management of all adverse events.  
 
Adverse events will be analyzed and reported after unblinding of the treatment code 
within the clinical study report. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported by [CONTACT_152245] [ADDRESS_892244] that occurs during use of the study drug, whether or not consider ed related to 
the drug; this includes accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug 
and/or dose), and reasons for surgical procedures. It is to be noted that procedures are 
not adverse events. Abnormal laboratory values or clinically sign ificant changes in 
laboratory values are not adverse events, but the underlying reasons are. Regardless of 
the severity or relationship to the investigational drug, all adverse events occurring 
during the study period must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF .  
 
An unexpected adverse event is one that has not been previously observed, or one that 
is of a specificity or severity not consistent with the current Investigator Brochure.  
8.1.1  Relationship to Study Drug  
The following definitions to assess the causal rela tionship between an adverse event 
and the study drug should be used:   
 
Not Related : The event is clearly related to other factors such as a subject’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant 
medications.  
 
Possibly Related :  The event has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug 
administration and follows a known response pattern to the study 
drug. However, a potential alternate etiology may be responsible 
for the event.  
 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-207 Aug. 6 , 2018 Page 26 of 42 
 
 Confidential    Related :  The event follows a clear -cut tempor al sequence from the time of 
drug administration and follows a known response pattern to the 
study drug and either occurs immediately following study drug 
administration, or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478], or reappears on 
repeat exposure.  
8.1.2  Adverse Event Seve rity 
Mild: A mild adverse event is one that the symptoms are barely 
noticeable to a subject. It does not influence performance or 
prevent a subject from carrying on with normal life activities.  
 
Moderate :  A moderate adverse event is one that the symptoms make the 
subject uncomfortable and causes some impairment to normal life 
activities. Treatment for symptom(s) may be required.  
 
Severe :  A severe adverse event is one that the symptoms cause severe 
discomfort to the subject and severely limits the subject’ s normal 
daily activities. Treatment for symptom(s) is given.  
 
Note that “serious ” and “severe ” are not synonymous. A serious 
adverse event must fulfill the requirements listed in the definition 
below, see section 8.1.3 . 
 
When intensity change s or occurs more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event will be listed. If the intensity category changes over a number of 
days, then these mini -events or changes will be recorded separately (i.e., having distinct 
onset days).  
8.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is an event that is:  
• fatal / results in death  
• life-threatening  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• requires or prolongs subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109]  
• is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 
Life Threatening  is defined as an event in which a subject is at risk of death at the time 
of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if 
it was more severe.  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-207 Aug. 6 , 2018 Page 27 of 42 
 
 Confidential    Death : The death of an enrolled subject is no t an event, but an outcome. It is the event 
that resulted in a fatal outcome that must be reported.  
Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
 
ANY SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT, INCLUDING DEATH DUE TO ANY CAUSE, 
WHICH OCCURS DURING THIS INVESTIGATION, WHETHER OR NOT RELATED 
TO THE STUDY MEDICATION, MUST BE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY (DURING 
NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS, 9 AM TO 5 PM, ET) TO THE SPONSOR/MEDICAL 
MONITOR.  
 
Any serious adverse event should be report ed to Eirion Therapeutics  by [CONTACT_18623] 
e-mail within [ADDRESS_892245]  be sent to Eirion 
Therapeutics . The original SAE report form should be maintained in the Regulatory 
Binder. It is the Sponsor’s responsibility to fulfill reporting obligations to the FDA . 
 
Reports of serious adverse events should be ma de by [CONTACT_183434]:  
 
Eirion Therapeutics  Clinical Development Department:  [PHONE_3833]  
or [PHONE_3834]  
Serious adverse events associated with the use of the study medication will be reported 
to appropriate regulatory agencies, investigators, and the IRB by [CONTACT_1034].  
8.1.4  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Unanticipated problems involv ing risk to subjects or others are:  
• Any serious event (including on -site and off -site adverse events, injuries, side 
effects, deaths or other problems) which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_661506], involved risk to subjects or others, a nd was possibly related to 
the research procedures.  
• Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved protocol that 
involves risk or has the potential to recur.  
• Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazard to a research subject.  
• Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or others.  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-207 Aug. 6 , 2018 Page 28 of 42 
 
 Confidential    • Any other serious and possibly related event which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_177503].

Medically accepted methods of birth control are surgical sterilization (tubal sterilization 
or hysterectomy), vaginal ring contraceptive, patch contraceptive, injectable 
contraceptive, implantable contraceptive, Intrauterine Device (IUD), diaphragm, 
condom , or spermicidal gel or foam. Oral contraceptives (prescribed birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) 
are also acceptable provided this method has been used for at least [ADDRESS_892247] Population(s) for Analysis  
9.1.[ADDRESS_892248] (LOCF) procedure will be used for each post -
baseline visit with missing data. The exception to this procedure will be the treatment of 
missing data only on one side of the face, as discussed  below. Subjects who are lost to 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_892249] -baseline visit will not be included in the 
analysis.  
 
An additional analysis may be performed in the per protocol population. Subjects will be 
considered “per protocol” if the y complete the final visit  evaluation without a major  
protocol violation. No data imputations will be made for this analysis.  
9.2 Statistical Methods  
9.2.1  Study Population  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic characteristics (age, 
gender, ra ce, height and weight) and background characteristics for all randomized 
subjects by [CONTACT_1570]. Past/coexistent medical history information for all 
randomized subjects will be presented in a by -subject listing. Baseline assessments of 
LCL severity wi ll also be presented as background characteristics of the population and 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
 
Demographic data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Categorical 
measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335]. Continuous measure s will be 
summarized with means, standard deviations and ranges (min and max).  
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize study medication compliance and 
exposure for all randomized subjects. Prior and concomitant medication information for 
all enro lled subjects will be presented in a by -subject listing.  
9.2.2  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The IGA and SSA scores (Crow’s Feet Wrinkle scale) are evaluations performed by [CONTACT_177519], respectively, measured both at rest and on contraction. For  
analysis purposes they will be averaged between left and right sides prior to analysis. In 
the event one side has missing data for a visit, the result from the side with non -missing 
data will be used instead of an average value. These scores will be treat ed as 
continuous measures for calculating means and performing ANOVA analyses, and they 
will be used as described below to derive binary indicators of treatment success, which 
will be analyzed as dichotomous measures.  
 
Efficacy analyses will be  based on th e assessments  from the treatment area s, i.e. the 
lateral canthal area only. Alpha will be set at 0.05 using two -tailed tests. The Crow’s 
Feet Wrinkle scale  is an ordinal categorical scale  ranging from 0 to 4. As described 
above, left - and right -side values will be averaged, and the averaged values will be used 
for analysis.  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-207 Aug. 6 , 2018 Page 30 of 42 
 
 Confidential     
The Investigator’s Global A ssessment (IGA) is the primary efficacy parameter , and the 
evaluation of each active drug group  vs. vehicle will be the primary comparison s. A 
compariso n between the two active drug groups will also be performed , along with a 
comparison between the two active drug groups pooled vs vehicle . Results will be 
summarized for each treatment group and at each visit using frequency distributions.  
 
For the primar y efficacy analysis , "IGA on contraction" (IGA -C) data will be analyzed at 
each visit  to evaluate the proportion of patients achieving treatment success  
(responder) . For this analysis, a respon se will be defined as a reduction from baseline in 
IGA-C by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_892250] -baseline visit to evaluate the proportion of 
patients achieving a composite treatment success, defined as a response on both  the 
IGA-C and SSA -C scales. The analysis model s for the primary efficacy analysis will be 
used.  
 
Treatment success based on the SSA alone will also be analyzed using the above 
definition and analysis model s. 
 
In addition, mean c hange from Baseline IGA will b e analyzed using a n analysis of 
variance ( ANOVA ) model.  The first model contrast s will be separate  evaluation s of the  
effect of each active group vs. vehicle.  Additional contrast s will be performed  comparing 
pooled active treatment groups vs. vehicle , and comparing the two active treatment 
groups . Contrasts will be made within the ANOVA model using LSMeans and the 
appropriate pooled error term, with no alpha adjustment for multiple comparisons. An 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline average IGA score as the 
covariate will be used if it yields greater sensitivity than the ANOVA model.  
 
A similar model will be used to analyze mean change from baseline SSA.  
 
Primary and secondary analyses will also be performed based on IGA and SSA 
evaluations made at rest.  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-207 Aug. 6 , 2018 Page 31 of 42 
 
 Confidential     
9.2.4  Safety Analysis  
The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events. 
Other safety data (e.g., vital signs and special tests) will be summarized as appropriate.  
Adverse events will be coded using a cur rent MedDRA dictionary and summarized by 
[CONTACT_1601], for each treatment group, the number and percentage of subjects having 
any adverse event, having an adverse event in each body system (System Organ 
Class), and having each coded individual adverse event.  Other adverse event 
information collected (e.g., severity/intensity or relationship to study medication) will be 
listed as appropriate.  
Data from other tests will be listed, notable values will be flagged, and any other 
information collected will be liste d as appropriate. No inferential statistical tests are 
planned for safety data but may be performed on an ad -hoc basis to highlight any 
comparisons that may warrant further consideration.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_892251] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTATION  
Data reflecting subject experience with the drug under investigation will be recorded on 
appropriate source documents  and in the eCRF . The investigator understands that the 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_892252]’s identification, evaluate the progress 
of the study, verify the accuracy and completeness of the eCRF s, assure compliance 
with protocol requirements, applicable FDA regula tions, IRB and ICH -GCP Guidelines, 
confirm that investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled, and resolve any inconsistencies 
in the study records. The sponsor may stop the study if it is observed that the protocol 
or sound clinical practices are not bei ng followed.  
 
[ADDRESS_892253] comply with all the requirements set forth in 21 
CFR § 56. The IRB is responsible for the initial approval, any amendments, 
advertisements, and continuing review of the proposed clinical study. The IRB will 
review any wr itten materials given to the subject and the Informed Consent Forms. The 
investigator must retain a copy of the approval letter that contains the study number, 
protocol title and identification of all documents approved. A copy of the letter must be 
sent t o the sponsor prior to drug shipment to the investigator.  
 
The investigator agrees to promptly report to the IRB all unanticipated problems 
involving risks to human subjects or others.  
 
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conf ormity with the 
principles of the "Declaration of Helsinki" and with the laws and regulations of the 
participating countries, whichever affords the greater protection to the individual. It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to obtain informed consen t in written form (according to 
local legal requirements) from each subject participating in this study. All subject s will be 
informed of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards and 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_892254] before he/ she is exposed to any study -related procedure, 
including screening tests for eligibility. The subject will r eceive a copy of the signed 
consent. The subject should be informed if new information becomes available that may 
be relevant to his/ her willingness to continue participation in the study. Each subject will 
be informed that the monitor, in accordance with  applicable regulatory requirements, 
may review his/ her medical records and data.  
 
Periodic status reports must be submitted at least yearly to the IRB. Within three 
months after completion or termination of the study, a final report should be submitted t o 
the IRB and the Sponsor. The investigator must maintain an accurate and complete 
record of all submissions made to the IRB including a list of all reports and documents 
submitted.  
  
The investigator is responsible for maintaining all the records which en able the conduct 
of the study at the site to be fully understood in compliance with the ICH -GCP filing 
standard. The investigator is responsible for the completion and maintenance of the 
confidential subject identification code which provides the sole link  between named 
subject  source records and the eCRF data. The investigator must arrange for the 
retention of study records for [ADDRESS_892255] keepi[INVESTIGATOR_177505]. After monitoring , source verification and authentication by [CONTACT_661515], the eCRF will be locked. The study specific data in the eCRF are 
the sole property of the Sponsor.  
 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all 
data in the eCRF and source documents. At all times, the Investigator has final 
responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered 
on the eCRF and source document.  
 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_892256] be completed or marked intentionally blank as appropriate 
following the instruc tions on the eCRF. eCRFs will be electronically signed and dated by 
[CONTACT_1720] a designated representative. If an entry on an eCRF already 
submitted requires change, the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will capture the 
reason for the change a nd then the correction will be made according to the procedures 
dictated by [CONTACT_27950].  
 
The investigator will maintain adequate records for the study including subject’s eCRFs, 
medical records, laboratory reports, informed consent forms, drug accounta bility 
records, safety reports, information regarding subjects who discontinued, and any other 
pertinent data.

 Confidential    Appendix  C: Procedure for Color Photography  
 
 
Equipment:  Digital Camera , Log Book ,  Subject -Specific Index Card  
 
Procedure:  In these clinical photographs, for the duration of the study, the only 
variable allowed to change is the skin condition itself. Therefore, anythin g 
extraneous to the condition (jewelry, makeup, clothing, furniture, walls, 
etc.) is to be eliminated from the fields to be photographed, from baseline 
through the final photographs. The necessity of good photos should be 
stressed to the subject s to ensure  their cooperation. Camera, lighting, 
framing, and exposure must be held consistent.  In the end, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_661507] a time -lapse movie.  
 
Ask the subject  to stand against a light background, away from any 
window or other source of external light. The subject  should hold a white 
index card  with his/her  identification number and initials. The photographer 
should stand about [ADDRESS_892258]  and set the camera for 
minimum zoom  and take 5 photographs : 1 full  frontal face photo,  and one 
45° view of each of the right and left periorbital region, both, “at rest” and 
“on contraction” .  
 
For the “at rest” pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] s, ask the subject to have a relaxed, 
expressionless composure . In the frontal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], the subject should hold 
an index card with subject ID , date  and initials . The ID card is not required 
for the 45 ° views. For the “on contraction ” pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], ask the subject to 
produce a smile that is maximally exaggerated by [CONTACT_661516] t o 
make the biggest smile possible.  An attempt should be made to 
consistently produce the same degree of smile in all photograph s. This 
can be guided by [CONTACT_661517].  
 
Maintain a Log Book that includes the following information:  
• Protocol Number  
• Investigator Name  
• Subject  Initials  
• Subject  ID Number  
• Visit week  
• Date of Visit  
• Photographer’s Initials

 Confidential    Appendix  D: Irritation Scoring  
 
 
For the irritation assessment, the following scale will be utilized : 
 
Numeric Grades:  
0 = no evidence of irritation  
1 = minimal erythema, barely perceptible  
2 = definite erythema, readily visible; or minimal edema; or minimal papular 
response  
3 = erythema and papules  
4 = definite edema  
5 = erythema, edema, and papules  
6 = vesicular eruption  
7 = strong reaction spreading  beyond test site  
 
All clinically significant skin responses observed with the test products or any score of 3 
or higher will be reported as an adverse event.

Objectives  
Mesolimbic dopamine (DA) release is a key signal for drug reward, and endogenous 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_306441]. 
A functional µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736] (OPRM1) A118G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
has been associated with increased risk for heroin addiction in some studies.  This 
polymorphism has been shown to confer differen tial pain sensitivity and to alter the 
release of DA following an alcohol challenge. The objective of this study is to examine 
the role of the A118G OPRM1 polymorphism for responses to a challenge of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] 
(morphine ) with regard to psycho -physiological  variables measured in the laboratory and 
for brain dopamine release measured by [11C]raclopride PET.  
Study population  
Healthy male participants who have had experience with oral prescription analgesics 
(e.g., Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet, oxycodone) will be recruited for the study.  These  
volunteers will be screened to obtain samples of two groups of subjects: 1) persons 
homozygous for the major 118A  allele (118AA genotype); 2) persons carrying one or 
two copi[INVESTIGATOR_306442] 118G allele (118AG or 118GG g enotype, hereafter called 
118GX).   We will recruit up to 120 participants to obtain 40 completers per genotype for 
the study.  
Design  
We will compare the response of these groups to a challenge with morphine  given 
intravenously. Participants will receive a  standardized IV challenge of morphine  (10.0 
mg/70 kg over 1 minute; morphine concentration 2 mg/ml).  Pre and post injecti on 
measures will be made in two areas: 1) subjective response as measured by [CONTACT_306544], and 2) measures of physiolo gical response, including pupil response to 
light, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oxygen saturation and a pain rating from putting a hand in cold 
water and blood chemistries. In addition, during this visit, participants will wear the 
AutoSense mobile physiological moni tor; parameters measured by [CONTACT_306545][INVESTIGATOR_1487], heart rate, heart -rate variability, skin conductance, and activity level.  The 
injection will be repeated in all participants in the PET scanner, once with  morphine and 
once with  normal saline.   Dopamine release will be assess ed by [CONTACT_306546] [11C]raclopride, a positron emitter labeled 
ligand which binds preferentially to D2 receptors  during saline administration and its 
binding potential during morphine administration .  
Outcome measures  
We hypothesize that 118GX subjects will have significantly different subjective response 
to the challenge than 118AA subjects as observed in participants receiving alcohol in a 
similar study  (Ramchandani et al. 2011) .  However, the genotype effect on the response 
may be opposite from the effect of genotype on the alcohol response.  We also 
hypothesize that the PET studies with [11C]raclopride  will show that 118GX subjec ts 
have less dopamine release during morphine administration than 118 AA subjects.

page 5 of 62 1. Introduction/ Scientific Rationale  
Background  
Dependence on oral prescription analgesics has become an increasing problem for young 
people in the US.  Among adolescents, prescription and over -the-counter medications 
account for most of the commonly abuse d illicit drugs by [CONTACT_306547] 
(http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] -in-brief/prescription -drug-abuse ).  
Prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_306445] µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328] . All opi[INVESTIGATOR_306446] (e.g., snorting or injecting) can intensify the 
effect.  Furthermore some abusers of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_306447].   
Of all abused substances, opi[INVESTIGATOR_306448] (Callaghan 
et al. 2012) .  Abuse or dependence on prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_306449] 
1.9 million people in the U.S.  Furthermore, men were more likely than women to 
endorse addictive behaviors related to prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (early prescription refills, 
physician refusal to prescribe because of abuse concerns; odds ratio 1.95; (Glass et al. 
1993) ).  
The h eritability  for opi[INVESTIGATOR_306450] 50% (Tsuang et al. 
1996;Tsuang et al. 1998) .  Genetic variation at the µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (OPRM -1) gene locus is an 
important candidate factor for s usceptibility to alcoholism, differential alcohol responses, 
and differential treatment responses to pharmacological treatments  and is also thought to 
be a factor in opi[INVESTIGATOR_96182] . The endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_306451], a physiological system likely 
involved in the reinforcing properties of all drugs of abuse with the exception of sedative -
hypnotics (Kreek et al. 2002;Contet et al. 2004) .  Quantitative trait locus studies and 
experiments with OPRM1 knockout mice have demonstrated the critical role played by 
[CONTACT_306548][INVESTIGATOR_306452] -administration (Becker et al. 2000;Belknap 
and Cr abbe 1992;LaForge et al. 2000;Matthes et al. 1996;Roberts et al. 2000) .  
A common functional A118G single -nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been identified 
in the coding region of exon 1 of the OPRM1 gene which has a high -enough frequency 
(10.5 % in a [LOCATION_001] City population (Bond et al. 1998) , 26% in a European population 
(Bart et al. 2004) , 24% in a European -American  population  (Zhang et al. 2006) , 40% in a 
study of a Chinese population (Zhang et al. 2007) , and up to 60% in some Asian 
populations (Tan et al. 2003) ) to make it a practical candidate for prospective research .  
In one study the A/G genotype was present in significantly more heroin users t han in 
controls (25.6% vs. 3.8%) (Drakenberg et al. 2006) , but another study did not find a 
greater incidence of the A/G genotype in either heroin or alcohol abusers (Franke et al. 
2001) .   
Human association studies have been inconsistent in demonstrating a relationship 
between and heroin addiction and the A118G SNP.  Szeto et al.  (2001)  found a 
significant association with the 118G variant among 200 heroin addicts in Hong Kong 
compared to 97 healthy controls.  The G allele was present in 39.5% of the addict 
population, vs. 29.4% of controls, with 16.5% of the addicts being GG homozygotes vs. 
11.3% in  controls (p=0.02).  Tan et al.  (2003)  found highly significant differences 
between ethnic groups  among  four different Asian populations in allele and g enotype 
frequencies; however, t he only significant association between heroin dependence and 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 6 of 62 genotype distribution (p=0.024) and allele frequency (p=0.009)  was in  Indians.   Bart et 
al. (2004)  as well as Drakenberg et al. (2006)  found and association between G -allele 
carrier status and heroin dependence, but another study did not find a greater frequency 
of the G allele in either heroin or alcohol abusers (Franke et al. 2001) . Inconsistent 
findings in association studies are common in psychiatric genetics, in part due to limited 
power of highly heterogeneous categorical disease phenot ypes. Experimentally based 
intermediate phenotype approaches are therefore an important complement to association 
studies.   
In that context, a [11C]raclopride PET study showed a robust release of dopamine 
following an alcohol challenge compared to placebo  in social drinkers who carried the G 
allele (Ramchandani et al. 2011) .  The effect of the G allele on µ opi[INVESTIGATOR_306453] [11C]carfentanil has been studied in alcohol -dependent participants and in 
smokers (Weerts et al. 2012;Ray et al. 2011) .  There was no effect of alcohol dependence 
on the binding of [11C]carfentanil, but carriers of the G allele had lower global binding 
potential (BP ND) for the  radioligand (Weerts et al. 2012) .  A similar lo wer binding 
potential was observed in smokers carrying the G allele, and the lower binding potential 
in some of the regions assayed was associated with greater subjective reward from 
smoking (Ray et al. 2011) .   
The effect of the G al lele on pain perception has been studied in various conditions.  
Fillingim et al. (2005)  demonstrated a significant difference in pressure pain thr eshold in 
individuals with the 118G variant SNP. Interestingly, this threshold difference was higher 
among men and lower among women with the 118G SNP as compared to controls .  
Nonetheless, the effect of fentanyl on perceived labor pain was greater in women 
carrying the G allele than in women homozygous for A resulting in the need for less 
analgesic (Landau et al. 2008) .  However the effect was opposite in a study by [CONTACT_306549]. (2008) . 
Bond et al. (1998)  using Xenopus oocyte  cells, found that receptors encoded by [CONTACT_306550] 118G allele showed increased affinity for the endogenous -opi[INVESTIGATOR_306454] -
endorphin in vitro, leading to increased activation of G -protein activated inwardly 
rectifying potassium channels following bindi ng of -endorphin (Bond et al. 1998) .  
However, Befort et al. (2001)  found no difference in binding affinity of -endorphin 
between wild type and A118G -coded -opi[INVESTIGATOR_306455] .  Similarly, Beyer et al. (2001)  found no difference in -opi[INVESTIGATOR_306456] A118G coded receptors using an in vitro  HEK 293 cell model.  
These discrepant in vitro  results reinforce the importance of examining the functional ro le 
of the -opi[INVESTIGATOR_306457], both at the cellular level, where coupling , 
etc. may be  determined by [CONTACT_306551], and at the level of the integrated organism.  
Using mouse lines that were modified to express either the human A allele or G allele for 
the OPRM1, Ramchandani et al. (2011) , found a 4 -fold greater dopamine release from an 
ethanol infusions in the mice carrying the G allele.  However, in vitro  autoradiography of 
the -opi[INVESTIGATOR_306458] r with [3H]DAMGO showed no difference between mouse lines.  
Current studies in collaboration with Drs. Shippenberg and Chefer at the NIDA IRP are 
testing dopamine release by [CONTACT_306552]. J. Elliot Robinson at the 
University of North Carolina are testing the effects on intracranial self stimulation (ICSS) 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 7 of 62 in these mouse lines in response to various opi[INVESTIGATOR_74453].  The results of these studies 
showed that morphine, but not fentanyl, oxycodone or buprenorphine reduced the 
threshold for ICSS in the mice homozygous for the A allele, but not in those mice 
homozygous for the G allele.  The microdialysis studies with morphine were consistent 
with the effects on ICSS; morphine induced release of dopamine was lower in the G/G 
mice than in the A/A mice.  These results suggest that the discrepant results observed in 
genetically engineered cells designed  to evaluate the effect of the 118G allele on -
endorphin binding and G -protein mediated intracellular effects  (Bond et al. 1998;Beyer et 
al. 2004)  may have been a result of using cells artificially modified to express the 
A118G -coded receptor and thus may be an artifact of the cell line or genetic engineering 
model selected.  
The mixed results in human population studies of the relationship between the A118G 
polymorphism and substance dependence may be confounded by [CONTACT_306553].  
First is the inher ent difficulty of isolating a small factor such as SNP genotype in a large 
and diverse population .  Second, the role played by [CONTACT_941] A118G SNP in heroin 
dependence (if any exists) may be more evident in the initia tion or development of the 
drug-taking behavi or in younger or more naïve populations than its maintenance in 
mature or dependent populations.  A previous [11C]raclopride PET study showed a robust 
release of dopamine following an alcohol challenge compared to placebo in social 
drinkers who carried the  G allele (Ramchandani et al. 2011) .  PET studies of dopamine 
release after an opi[INVESTIGATOR_306459] (Spreckelmeyer et al. 
2011;Hagelberg et al. 20 02;Daglish et al. 2008) .  The reasons for these inconsistencies 
are unknown, but may be due to the genetic makeup of the participants, which was not 
tested or to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_306460].  In the study by [CONTACT_306554]. (2011) , 
remifentanil (0.3 g/kg)  was used and the authors suggest that this drug is most similar to 
the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], -endorphin.  No human studies to date have tested the effect of 
morphine on dopamine release, but it is expected to cause dopamine release as observed 
with mi crodialysis in rodents.  
As the study outlined in the present protocol aims to examine whether OPRM1 A118G 
variation moderates the mesolimbic DA response to µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_306461] , it is 
important that we have a signal that could be modified . Using no n-human primates, it 
was previously found that the rhesus ortholog of the human OPRM1 A118G SNP only 
moderated alcohol -induced psychomotor stimulation (a marker of mesolimbic DA 
activation) in males but not in females (Barr et al. 2007) . This difference was presumably 
due to the negligible overall psychomotor response in the latter group. In agreement with 
those observations, a subsequent human PET stu dy (Urban et al. 2010;Barr et al. 2007)  
found only marginal alcohol -induced DA release (measured as % change in 
[11C]raclopride binding potential ) in females , while a robust response was present in 
males. Alcoh ol activates mesolimbic DA neurons indirectly, through release of 
endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_306462] µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328] (Heilig et al. 2011;Urban et al. 
2010) . Because endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_306463]  (Mitchell et al. 2012) , it must be concluded that the observed sex 
differences are likely to be postsynaptic. A similar sexual dimorphism is therefore l ikely 
to exist for actions of an exogenous µ-agonist. Taken together, these observations thus 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 8 of 62 make it unlikely that the hypothesis of the present study can be addressed in females, 
providing a compelling scientific rationale for restricting recruitment to males.  
We will  therefore  examine the role of the A118G SNP for subjective and objective 
responses to a standardized intravenous morphine challenge  in opi[INVESTIGATOR_113031], non-
dependent  males.  Subjective psychological and objective psycho -physiological 
responses, as well as brain dopamine release will be examined in response to the 
challenge, all using well -established methods as described below. To effectively 
investigate a relationship between this polymorphism (A118G) and the endophenotype in 
question (pe rsons likely to abuse/become dependent on opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]), we plan to  identify an 
adequate sample of subjects  with and without the genotype  in question , but without 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_9825],  and compare their responses to an opi[INVESTIGATOR_306464].   
As the f requency of the G allele varies among ethnic populations, we will obtain self -
reports of race and ethnicity and obtain ancestry scores from large SNP panels to control 
for potential differences between carriers of the G allele and A allele homozygotes.  
The following tests are known to be sensitive to opi[INVESTIGATOR_306465]:  
1. McGill Pain – Cold Pressor Test  (Posner et al. 1985)  
2. Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_306466]  
3. Drug Effect Questionnaire (DEQ) (Holdstock and de Wit 1999)  
4. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_13581]  
5. Pulse Oximetry (a measure of oxygen saturation in blood).  
  
Name [CONTACT_306604](s):  [11C] raclopride will be administered under an 
IND held by [CONTACT_306555].  
Morphine (10 mg/70 kg) will be  administered as a sterile soluti on of 2 mg/ml over 1 
minute.    
Subjects will also receive an MRI (about 5 minutes) for co -registration with the PET.   In 
addition, a  resting scan (approximately 5 minutes) to assess connectivity of brain regions 
at rest  and a  diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)  scan (about 7 minutes) to assess white matter 
integrity  will be acquired.   The purpose of these MRI scans is t o determine if there is an 
effect of the OPRM1 genotype on brain connectivity (resting state), and its relationship to 
genetic -induced alteration s in dopamine release. In addition, the structural MRI is 
required for the PET scan (and functional scan) alignments. These tests will be done only 
once and not performed while the participant is receiving the opi[INVESTIGATOR_306467].  The DTI 
scans are being per formed to examine the relationship of white matter integrity to the 
above dependent variables.  
Statement of GCP: The study will be carried out following standard guidelines for good 
clinical practice.   
2. Study objectives or hypotheses  
a. Hypotheses:  
Homozygo us carriers of the 118 A allele of the -opi[INVESTIGATOR_306468] (rev 9.21.11)    
page 9 of 62 118G allele (118GX) , paralleled by [CONTACT_306556] [11C] raclopride  following 
morphine injection  because of greater do pamine release than c arriers of the G allele.    
Objectives:  
a.Primary objectives : To examine the role of the -opi[INVESTIGATOR_306469]1 A118G on the subjective and objective effects, 
including dopamine release,  of the -opi[INVESTIGATOR_306470] . 
b.Secondary objectives : A number of exploratory analyses will be carried 
out with the collected data to generate hypotheses on the relation of patient 
characteristics (e.g. family history of alcohol/drug use disorders , pain, mood, 
etc.), physiologic al opi[INVESTIGATOR_306471] ( e.g., pupil constriction, cardiovascular 
parameters  such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_1521] % oxygen saturation as measured by 
[CONTACT_306557] ), endocrine responses ( cortisol, ACTH ), pain threshold (measured 
by [CONTACT_306558]), MRI scans, and positive psycholo gical effects (as 
measured via visual analog scale) with DA release measured by [CONTACT_10052].  
3. Subjects  
a. Description of study populations  
i. Brief  description of subject groups  
Subjects will be 21-[ADDRESS_375302], but are not currently taking 
them or dependent on them. All participants will be in good health , non -smokers  or light 
smokers (< 20 cigarettes/week) , current non drinkers or social drinkers ; participants 
should not meet DSM IV criteria for alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.   Subjects will 
be recruited into two groups: 1) subject s homozygous for the major 118A allele (118AA 
genotype) of the OPRM 1 polymorphism; 2) subject s carrying one or two co pi[INVESTIGATOR_306472] 118G allele (118AG or 118GG genotype, hereafter called 118GX) of the OPRM [ADDRESS_375303] had negative experiences (e.g., allergic response, excessive nausea and/or vomiting, 
itching) as  these side effect s could make ob taining the PET scan difficult.  The 
experience of an individual who has taken even one or two prescription pain pi[INVESTIGATOR_306473].  In additio n, participants will be excluded if they have 
used pi[INVESTIGATOR_306474] (> 6 weeks) or recently (within the previous 3 months).  The 
purpose of these criteria is to remove possible residual effects on the receptor.   
We have chosen to restrict the study popul ation to ages 21-55 years to reduce age -related 
variability in the study. Since the ventral striatum shrinks an average of 3.6 to 3.7% per 
decade (Gunning -Dixon et al. 1998) , a wider age range introduces significant and

We have chosen to restrict the stud y to men only based on the lack of an effect in women

8. Presence of certain implanted devices (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, 
some artificial joints, metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], surgical clips or other implanted metal parts), 
body morphology, or claustrophobia. Justificatio n: Implanted devices may 
increase the risk of MRI scanning and/or adversely affect the quality of the data; 
body morphology may prevent optimal positioning in the scanner and thus affect 
the quality of the data; participants with  claustrophobia may find th e MRI scan 
too unpleasant and may exhibit excess movement that will adversely affect the 
quality of the data. Assessment tool(s): Prospective participants will fill out an 
MRI screening questionnaire and undergo an interview with an MR technologist.  
Quest ions concerning suitability for scan ning will be referred to the Medical 
Advisory Investigator.  Prospective participants will be questioned about 
symptoms of claustrophobia and placed in the mock scanner during their first visit 
to assess for possible dif ficulty tolerating the confinement of the scanner and for 
ability to fit into the scanner.  
9. Conditions restricting participant’s  ability to lie flat for up to two hours (such as  
coagulopathies, superficial or deep vein thrombosis, or musculoskeletal 
abnorma lities).   Justification: PET scanning sessions require participants to lie 
flat on their backs and  remain perfectly still for approximately two hours. 
Therefore, conditions that would make  that difficult (e.g. chronic back pain, 
significant scoliosis) or d angerous (e.g. familial  hypercoagulability syndrome, 
history of thrombosis) will be exclusionary. Assessment  tool(s): History and 
physical examination by a qualified IRP clinician, supplemented with  a trial of 
lying in the mock scanner to assess comfort.  
10. Head trauma leading to loss of consciousness for more than 5 min or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]

study tracer, would result in cumulative exposure of >5 rem within the previous 
12 month p eriod.  
12. Self-reported and/or observed signs, symptoms, or diagnosis of Raynaud’s or 
Buerger’s disease (e.g., pain in hands or feet at times of rest, during/following 
cold exposure or stress, any significant color changes in hands or toes).  
Additionally, me dical staff will be present to watch for these symptoms during the 
actual cold pressor test. 
 
4. Study Design  and Methods  
a. Study overview  – 
The study will require at least [ADDRESS_375304] 
approximately 5 -8 hours .  Visits 1 (consent visit) and 2 (toleration visit) will be at the 
BRC in Baltimore, the other two visits (Visits 3 and 4)  will be conducted in the NIAAA 
Outpatient clinic and the PET scanning facility of the Clinical Center  in Bethesda.  The 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page [ADDRESS_375305] (1SE Unit) at the NIH 
Clinical Center.  
During the screening visit performed under the screening protocol (06 -DA-N415), MMG  
will screen healthy participants from a population  who have had experience with oral 
prescription analgesics to obtain samples of two groups of subject s: 1) subject s 
homozygous for the major 118A allele (118AA genotype) of the OPRM 1 polymorphism; 
2) subject s carrying one or two copi[INVESTIGATOR_306442] 118G allele (118AG or 118GG 
genotype, hereafter called 118GX) of the OPRM 1 polymorphism.  At the time of c onsent 
to 13 -AA-0061  the entire study will be explained and the  participant  given the 
opportunity to enroll in the study.  During the consent visit (hereafter called Visit 1 of the 
protocol) or the next visit, participants will be given a questionnaire to evaluate his 
previous response to  oral prescription analgesics (See Appendix I).   During Visit 1  or 
another visit, the participant will undergo the MRI portion of the study.  
During Visit 2, participants , who successfully pass the initial screening and enro ll in the 
study after the consent interview, will receive a placebo injection and subsequently a  
standardized opi[INVESTIGATOR_306467] . The opi[INVESTIGATOR_306478] a standardized IV in jection  of 
morphine , (10.0 mg/70 kg; 2 mg/ml) administered over [ADDRESS_375306]-placebo)  and post -morphine injection  measures will be made in two areas: 1) 
subjective response as measured by a standardized q uestionnaire (DEQ), and 2) objective 
measures response . We will determine their response to a cold pressor pain test, and a 
measurement of their pupi[INVESTIGATOR_306479], including continuous Pulse Ox monitoring and intermittent monitoring 
of their respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, EKG and blood pressure. Blood will be col lected to 
measure plasma ACTH and cortisol levels as they may be suppressed by [CONTACT_306561] 
−opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736]. Retrospectively, participants will be asked to evaluate their peak 
experience to the morphine on a Likert -like visual analog scale (VAS), which will 
include sedation, euphoria, dizziness, fatigue, depression, tremors, anxiousness, upset 
stomach/nausea, dry mouth, and headache, which are common side effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_306480] ( Appendix I ).  We hypothesize that [ADDRESS_375307] a week apart (Visits 3 and 4), participants will report 
to the Clinical Center in Bethesda for an overnight stay before each PET scan.  W e will 
repeat the  injection  procedure in all participants twice in the PET scanner, once injecting  
morphine and once injecting  saline, and assess the binding potential of [11C]raclopride, a 
positron emitter labeled ligand which binds preferentially to D2 dopamine receptors.  The 
difference between the binding potential following the saline inject ion and that during the 
morphine injection will provide a measure of dopamine release.  We hypothesize that 
118AA subjects will have a lower binding potential with [11C]raclopride from the 
morphine injection  relative to placebo, indicating greater amounts of dopamine release  
than those subjects carrying one or two copi[INVESTIGATOR_1093] G allele .

page 13 of 62 b. Recruitment  
This study employs an experiment of nature, i.e. genetic variability, as a basis for group 
assignment. To obtain the respective groups, this protocol will b e conducted in the 
following phases:   
1. Recruitment of potential participants through approved advertis ing media (see 
draft ad in Appendix II) . 
2. Thorough screening of selected participants according to 06-DA-N415 
(“Screening Protocol for the Evaluation of Po tential Research Subjects”).  
3. Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], which will allocate subjects into two groups: A) 118AA 
homozygotes, and B) 118AG heterozygotes, and 118GG homozygotes  
4. An invitation to members of each group to join the study with an effort to balance 
the groups dem ographically, most likely by [CONTACT_306562] B.  
Ads will be placed in approved media seeking healthy volunteers between ages 21-[ADDRESS_375308] had experience with prescription 
analgesics (e.g., Oxycontin, Vic odin, oxycodone), but are no longer needing these 
medications.  They must be willing to undergo genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_306481], het erozygous, or negative for the 118G SNP (as per methodology of Skarke 
et al. (2004) ). 
c. Screening  
An initial screen will be accomplished by [CONTACT_306563].  
If the participants appear to qualify based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, they 
will be invited for an in -person screening visit , consisting of informed  consent 
procedures, blood draw s for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_306482]/exclusion criteria .  The screenin g evaluation will include:  
1. medical history  
2. drinking and drug use history using the Drug Use Survey  
3. Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID) psychiatric diagnoses including 
alcohol or drug dependence  as currently administered by [CONTACT_306564].  
4. physical examin ation, including EKG  
5. fasting blood samples for routine blood chemistry, complete blood count (CBC), 
liver function , hepatitis B and hepatitis C, a serum HIV screen , and TSH   
6. urine sample for illicit drug screen  
7. MRI screen . 
8. The determination of a lack of ni cotine dependence will be based on the potential  
participant’s stated ability to regularly abstain from smoking for 1 -2 days/week.   
9. Tuberculin skin testing   
The study will be open to participants of all races. All participants will be recruited 
through approved advertising media . Participants  go through a consent interview during 
which the study will be fully explained.  If they chose to enroll, they  will sign the 
informed consent form prior to enrollment in the study .  
d. Study Procedures  
Study Overview:  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 14 of 62 Visit 1 – This visit will involve reviewing the consent and if the person agrees to 
participate, may involve additional questionnaires and the MRI scans.  It may be 
necessary to schedule these procedures on a separate day.  
Visits [ADDRESS_375309] injection will be placebo 
(normal saline) and the second will be morphine to measure its subjective and 
physiological effects prior to th e PET sessions; the other two injections, morphine or  
placebo , will be given  while  the participant is  undergoing a PET scan s with 
[11C]raclopride  (Visits 3 and 4) . The in jections  during Visit 2  will be conducted at the 
BRC . The in jections  during Visits 3 a nd 4 will be conducted during PET in the Nuclear 
Medicine department  at the NIH Clinical Center . 
During the study visits  that do not involve the PET scans , participants will arrive at the 
BRC by 8:00AM on the morning of testing, following an overnight fast , and after 
abstaining from alcohol and all medications for 72 hours. To minimize variance in 
caffeine consumption, patients will be asked to report to the clinic having had no 
caffeinated coffee, tea, or soda in the morning.  
On days when participants cou ld receive morphine (Visits 2, 3 or 4), they will be brought 
to the BRC or C linical Center  in a taxi paid for by [CONTACT_4289]. Participants will receive a light 
breakfast (~300 cal). A breathalyzer test will be performed to ensure a zero breath alcohol 
concentratio n and a CO test for recent smoking or exposure to second hand smoke (a CO 
over 15 ppm indicates likely recent smoking and participant will be disqualified).  For 
subjects reporting use of  e-cigarettes, recent use will be assessed by [CONTACT_746] a cotinine 
salivary test such as NicAlert (a cotinine value over 1 indicates likely recent e -cigarette 
use and participant will be disqualified).  
During Visit 1 after giving informed consent or in a subsequent separate visit (herein  
termed Visit 1a), participants will  complete a ssessments of baseline pain, sleep, and 
depression/anxiety as these may impact subjective assessment of drug effects  - Brief Pain 
Inventory ( BPI), abbreviated Comprehensive Psychopathology Rating Scales  (aCPRS ), 
WHO QOL Bref, Sleep Disorders Que stionnaire, and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] 
(PSQI) .  The MRI scans, which will be completed before Visits 3 and 4 , may occur 
during Visit 1 or 1a.  
During Visit 2, physiological responses (RR, HR, EKG and oxygen saturation) will be 
monitored using standa rd instrumentation (EKG, pulse oximetry) continuously for [ADDRESS_375310].  Santosh Kumar.  Parameters measured by [CONTACT_306545][INVESTIGATOR_1487], heart rate, heart -rate variability, skin conductance, and activity level.  
The sensors are hosted on a tiny  computing platform called a wireless sensor mote (with 
dimensions simila r to those of the memory cards used in digital cameras).  Sensors are 
attached to an elastic belt that is worn around the chest.  Two electrodes, similar to those 
used in ECGs, are placed on the chest and connected to the sensors in the belt.   Data are

MRI scans:  
All MRI scans will be performed in the Trio at the BRC . The participants will not receive 
any drug before these scans.  Under this protocol or [ADDRESS_375312] already been performed 
and will be used for this protocol.   
Repeating the MRI scans - Because excessive head movement is an obstacle to obtaining 
quality fMRI data, participants who generate unusable data (or if there is an equipment 
failure) during t heir scanning session may be asked to repeat the session.  Repeating the 
session will maximize the risk/benefit ratio of the MRI scanning as it will allow 
completion of all aspects of the study.   
Participant s will be given a meal once collection of depend ent measures is complete.   
After the meal, orthostatic vitals will be obtained and if there is no evidence of 
symptomatic orthostasis the participant will be discharged.   
Visit 2  Morphine injection with subjective and physiological measures (Toleration 
Study):  
The purpose of this visit is two -fold.  The first is to reduce the likelihood that side effects  
like vomiting will occur in the PET scanner.  The second is to obtain data on the 
participant ’s responses (pain response and pupil response) to morphine a t a time when the 
participant is not in the scanner when such measurements would be more difficult to 
acquire.  Following a prestudy nursing assessment, which includes urine toxicology,  
breathalyzer, CO monitoring, HR, BP, RR, and weight, t wo indwelling in travenous 
catheters will be i nserted, one each into the ante cubital vein of the arm using sterile 
technique. The following table summarizes the prestudy nursing assessments obtained:  
 
Measurement  Parameter(s) to proceed  
Breathalyzer  Negative  
CO test  ≤ 15 ppm 
Urine toxicology  Negative  
Heart rate*  ≥50 bpm and ≤105 bpm  
Systolic blood pressure*  ≥95 mmHg and ≤135 mmHg  
Diastolic blood pressure*  ≥60 mmHg and ≤90 mmHg  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]*  ≥8 and ≤24 breaths per minute  
Oxygen saturation*  ≥94%  
 
One catheter wil l be used for the placebo and morphine injections  and the other will be 
used for blood sampling.   A nurse will monitor HR, BP, RR, ECG and blood oxygen 
saturation throughout the study.  Measurements will be recorded at [ADDRESS_375313] 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page [ADDRESS_375314] the 
AutoSense ECG electrodes and respi[INVESTIGATOR_306484]’s chest for continuous 
physiologic al monitoring throughout the session.  Monitoring by [CONTACT_306565].  
Baseline measurements (as described below) will then be obtained. After this, the placebo 
injection (normal saline in a volume equa l to that used for the morphine injection) will be 
given (at approximately 9:45AM).   
At baseline as well as during and after the in jection , the following measures will be 
obtained, following the schedule outlined in the study -session flow -sheet (Table 1):  
Subjective questionnaires: a visual analog scale of high and intoxication See Appendix I. 
for Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) (Holdstock and de Wit 1999) .  The DEQ consists 
of four visual analog scales used to describe current drug effects (feel drug effects, none 
(0) to a lot (l00)]; like the effects they feel, dislike (0) to neutral (50) to  like extremely 
(l00); feel high, not at all (0) to a lot (l00); and (4) would like more not at all (0) to a lot 
(100).   
Objective Measurements: 1) Pupil constriction (Grace et al. 2010) , cold pressor test 
(Posner 1991) , and 2) Blood will be drawn at baseline and at 10 min after the injection  
for analysis of blood chemistries potentially responsive to an opi[INVESTIGATOR_306467] (including, 
but not limited to ACTH and cortisol)  (Jaffe 1985) .  
Cold Pressor Test: The cold water  pressor test evaluates discomfort or pain when the 
nondominant hand  is first placed in a warm water bath (37° C) for 2 min, then transferred 
to an ice water bath (0 ° C).  The participant is instructed to immerse his/her hand in the 
ice water for up to [ADDRESS_375315] sensed pain.  This 
time measures pain threshold.  Time to withdrawal measures pain endurance  (Posner 
1991) . See scoring sheet in Appendix I.  
Pupil constriction test: Participants will be instructed to sit  quietly, blinking as little as 
possible while the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_306485].  While 
the participant focuses on a fixed point. The resting pupil diameter will be measured for [ADDRESS_375316] is a modification of a previously reported 
method (Grace et al. 2010)  to remain within  the time of the expected drug effect and will 
commence four minutes after the participant puts his hand in the cold water.  
The participant will be returned to the lounge for a relaxation period and a snack or 
lunch.  In early afternoon, the participant wi ll return to the study room for the morphine 
injection,  which will be administered by [CONTACT_306566].  Participants will receive an injection of 10 mg/70 kg morphine (2 mg/ml) 
administered by [CONTACT_306567] [ADDRESS_375317] returned to 
normal ranges.  Values will be recorded  approximately every 5 min (+/ - 1) for the next [ADDRESS_375318] returned to normal ranges.

Visits 3 and 4: PET studies of [11C]raclopride binding with and without morphine:  
Participant will be brought to the Clinical Center via taxi during the afternoon or early 
evening of each day before the scheduled PET studies.  
Outline of PET session procedures : 
1) Two IV lines will be started, one for in jection  of [11C]raclopride, the other for the 
morphine or placebo (normal saline in a volume equal to that used for the morphin e 
injection) injection . 
2) Subjects will be placed in the PET scanner and administered a bolus of 
[11C]raclopride.  
3) Subject s will be administered either a  morphine or a placebo (normal saline) in jection  
using the procedure identical to that used in sessi on 0.  
4) The subjective questionnaires will be administered at baseline and during the morphine 
or placebo (normal saline) challenge, identical to the procedures used in Visit 2 .  Blood 
samples for blood chemistries will be drawn as described for Visit 2 .  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 18 of 62 Detailed description of PET procedure:  
Scans will be performed with the GE Advance tomograph that acquires [ADDRESS_375320] to gently immobilize the head while in the scanner. Each 
individual's mask  will be used for each PET scan in that individual, to ensure similar 
head positioning.  First, a  transmission scan lasting approximately 8-min will be acquired 
with two rotating rod sources for the purpose of attenuation correction.  The tracer will be 
prepared and tested for purity just prior to use.   
At 5 min following the morphine, which will be administered by [CONTACT_306568], or placebo injection, up to 12 mCi [11C]raclopride 
will be administered as a bolus over one minute into the  IV line in the opposite arm.   
Monitoring of HR, RR, BP, EKG and oxygen saturation will begin immediately by [CONTACT_306569].  Values will be recorded every 5 min for the duration of the 
PET scan by [CONTACT_306570].  The participant will be 
asked how he feels in addition to the administration of the DEQ in the event he feels 
nauseous or needs to vomit.  He will also be encouraged to tell the study staff at any time 
if he feels nauseous or needs to vomit.  I n the event that the participant experiences either 
of these side effects, he will be removed from the scanner until the effects subside or if 
they do not, the study will be discontinued.  As the participant cannot easily view the 
DEQ in paper form or on a  computer while he is in the scanner, he will be asked to 
provide a number between 0 and 100 in response to the four DEQ questions. An NIH 
Credentialed physician with ACLS certification, will continue to monitor these values for 
60 min or until the values return to normal ranges.  Dynamic PET scans will begin with 
the [11C]raclopride injection and continue approximately 90 minutes to obtain optimal 
signal.   
The PET data from the placebo day will be used as a measure of baseline raclopride 
binding potential , using the Simplified Reference Tissue Model outlined by [CONTACT_306571] (1996) . PET meas urements taken following the morphine injection  will be 
compared to that derived from placebo in jection  to measure the reduction in specific 
binding due to competition with dopamine endogenously released by [CONTACT_306572]. The percent change from b aseline has been shown to be proportional to the 
magnitude of dopamine release (Watabe et al. 2000) .

*Please note monitoring of these parameters will be continuous throughout the scan and 
recording of these parameters will continue at [ADDRESS_375321] 
not returned to normal ranges .  It is expected that during the visit in which the participant 
receives placebo, these values will be normal throughout the study, but they will be 
monitored for  the same duration and at the same frequency as that for the morphine 
session . 
After the study is completed, subjects will return to the NIAAA inpatient area (1 SE) 
where they undergo a post scan assessment . If any medical complaints or concerns are 
voiced, appropriate medical attention will be provided. Subjects will be taken home by 
[CONTACT_306573] r by [CONTACT_306574] .  
End of Participation  
Participants will undergo a post -study assessment, typi[INVESTIGATOR_306488]  
(Visit 4). The evaluation will include vital signs, EKG, CBC and blood chemistr y. This  
evaluation will occur after the participant has been cleared for discharge.  
Visit 5 (by [CONTACT_648]) The Lead Investigator or her designate will contact [CONTACT_306575]. No other need for re -contact [CONTACT_306576]. However, should 
the need arise for any reason, the names and contact [CONTACT_306577].  No information on the results of the g enetics 
test or the results of the PET scans will be shared with the participants.  
5. Storage of data and samples:  
Plasma s amples for cortisol and ACTH collected at the BRC will be stored temporarily in 
a freezer located in the Freezer room.  Plasma s ample s for cortisol and ACTH collected at 
the Clinical Center will be stored in a controlled access freezer room at the LCTS inside 
the NIH Clinical Center.  Samples collected at the BRC will be transferred to the Clinical 
Center by [CONTACT_306578] (once every month to two months 
depending on the number of participants ).  The samples will be kept until they are 
analyzed, which is expected to be when all participants have completed the protocol.    All 
sample and data analyses are expected  to be completed within [ADDRESS_375322] PET -
scan.  
Collection of blood for OPMR1 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_306489] ( 06-DA-N415 ).  Samples will be used to identify carriers of the G 
allele and those individuals who  are homozygous for the A allele.   The DNA will also be 
collected during Visit 1.  It will be used to determine ancestry scores from large SNP 
panels.   Biological specimens obtained at the Clinical Center and those sent from the 
BRC will be stored in coded  form (serial numeric codes) in freezers located in the access 
controlled Building 10 Hatfield CRC 1SE laboratory area of NIAAA/LCTS.  
Blood collected for genetic testing will be kept indefinitely for future analysis of relevant 
gene polymorphisms about wh ich new data may emerge in the future literature. Blood 
obtained as part of this protocol will be stored in coded form (serial numeric codes) in a 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 20 of 62 freezer in the NIDA Freezer Room until they are shipped to NIAAA for analysis.   Once 
they are at NIAAA, they will be stored in freezers located in the access controlled 
Building 10 Hatfield CRC 1SE laboratory area of NIAAA/LCTS.   They will be analyzed 
for various biomarkers (at the NIAAA Lab of Clinical and Translational Studies).    
De-identified data from the Au toSense and age, gender, and drug use history will be sent 
to [CONTACT_72117] at the University of Memphis (Material Transfer Agreement #[ZIP_CODE] -10; 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] 7/29/2016) and to [CONTACT_306605] at Washington University (Data 
Transfer Agreement in process) for analysis.  
6. Additional Considerations  
a. Research with investigational drugs or devices  
i. Medications/devices requiring IND/IDE:  
The radiotracer, 11C raclopride , will be administered under IND  
#[ZIP_CODE]  held by [CONTACT_306579] -PET Imaging Department  
The radi ation exposure is for research purposes only.  
ii. Source of materials/storage/handling  
The radiotracers will be made by [CONTACT_306580].  
iii. Attach investigator’s brochure  
No investigator’s brochure is available.  
b. Gene Therapy  
i. Identify if ge ne therapy is used (if so, attach RAC documentation)  
No gene therapy will be done.  
7. Risks/ discomforts  
Known risks and discomforts associated with study procedures and medications:  
Morphine  injection : 
Side effects from opi[INVESTIGATOR_306490], eupho ria, dizziness, fatigue, depression, 
tremors, sleeplessness, anxiousness, flu -like symptoms, upset stomach, vomiting, dry 
mouth, pupil constriction, itching , transient rash, hallucination, delirium, sweating, 
muscle and bone pain, confusion, extreme irrita bility , constipation and muscle spasms. 
Severe side effects can include severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], confusion or stupor, coma, 
clammy skin, circulatory collapse and cardiac arrest.  So metimes, even in the case of 
individuals who later become addicted, i nitial injections may produce unpleasant 
sensations such as headache, dizziness, and nausea .  Participants will be encouraged to 
take extra fluids to avoid constipation.  
With the exception of allergic reactions, adverse effects of morphine are largely dose -
dependent, and the level of risk is therefore associated with the dose chosen. The FDA 
approved label recommends i.v. morphine doses between 4 – 10 mg/70 kg that can be 
repeated every 4 hours. In the present study, subjects will receive no more than a sin gle 
morphine dose of 10  mg/70 kg on any given day. A literature search shows that when this 
dose was previously used in research volunteers, these experienced several central 
morphine effects, such as for instance feeling sleepy, clumsy, dizzy, high or int oxicated 
(Zacny et al. 1994a;Zacny et al. 1994b;Zacny et al. 1997a;Zacny et al. 1997b;Stoops et 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 21 of 62 al. 2012) . It is therefore to be expected that some or all of these effects will be 
experienced by [CONTACT_306581] s. These effects are reversible, may cause discomfort, but 
do not pose a significant medical safety concern.  
The most important adverse effect of morphine, which does pose a significant medical 
risk, is that the drug can depress or stop breathing. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_306491]. Unless properly monitored and treated, it may lead to death. The five studies 
cited above together exposed 65 subjects to 10 mg morphine / 70 kg (Zacny et al. 
1994a;Zacny et al.  1994b;Zacny et al. 1997a;Zacny et al. 1997b;Stoops et al. 2012) .  One 
of the studies (Stoops et al. 2012)  also included a 20 mg/70  kg dose, and demonstrated an 
orderly and linear dose -respo nse relationship for end -tidal CO 2, such that that 10 mg dose 
was intermediate between the 5 and 20 mg doses. The latter study also exposed subjects 
to multiple doses. No serious adverse events were observed after the 10 mg/70 kg 
morphine dose in any of th e 65 published cases, and no serious adverse events were 
encountered in the paper using a 20 mg dose. In people receiving morphine after surgery, 
the incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_306492] a hundred 
subjects (Dahan et al. 2010) . 
i. Steps taken to minimize risk  
Participants will be screened for a history of nega tive effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_306493] , and 
excluded if such a history is present. As all participants will have had experience with 
pain pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], it is expected that they will come to the study with knowledge of their previous 
experiences.  Participants will  be excluded if they have used pi[INVESTIGATOR_306474] (> 6 weeks) 
or recently (within the previous 3 months).  The purpose of these criteria is to remove the 
possibility of residual effects on the receptor.  
The potential adverse consequences of the morphine inj ection primarily involve  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], skeletal muscle rigidity, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, 
dizziness or other impairment.  Following the morphine injection, oxygen saturation, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and heart rate will be monito red continuously by [CONTACT_306582] [ADDRESS_375323] diss ipated (e.g., vital signs in normal range and no signs of 
impairment) and the participant reports that they are not experiencing any drug effects at 
which time they should be able to safely to leave the NIH premises and will be taken 
home in a taxi arrange d and paid for by [CONTACT_18121].  
PET scan:  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page [ADDRESS_375324] reported a sense of claus trophobia or panic in reaction to 
placement in an MRI or PET scanner. Participants will be instructed to report such 
feelings so they can be removed from the apparatus and will not be required to continue 
with the session if they are uncomfortable with the  procedure. If they cannot continue, 
this will require withdrawal from the study, and they will be paid for their participation 
up to that point.  
In summary, t he risk / discomfort of the morphine injection procedure represents more 
than a minor increase ov er minimal, but is well justified by [CONTACT_306583].  
MRI:  
MRI scans are routinely carried out both for clinical and research purposes. Individuals 
will complete an MRI safety checklist.  Subjects with metal objects in their body may be 
negatively aff ected, and are therefore excluded from this study. The enclosed space of the 
scanner can provoke anxiety in some individuals. If so, the scan is discontinued, where 
upon the anxiety resolves. Finally, MRI is a noisy process, so we require participants to 
wear foam earplugs while inside the scanner.   The risk / discomfort of this procedure is 
judged to be minimal.   
Genetic testing:  
No adverse events are anticipated as a result of the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  However, to protect 
confidentiality no genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_306494]. 
No CLIA [Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act] certified genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_306495] a 
clinical diagnostic or insuranc e purpose will be performed. In the study, there will be no 
identification of genetic diseases, and subsequently, and consequently, no relevant 
information to report to the participants .  The participants will be told that the medical 
relevance of the geno typi[INVESTIGATOR_306496], while other information ( e.g. 
a positive family history of drug problems ) is a known indicator of susceptibility . 
Thus, this is considered a minimal risk / discomfort procedure.  
Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_306497] : 
This test is a widely used psychophysiological measure with minimal risk and 
discomfort.  
Cold pressor test : 
Participants may remove their hands when the pain becomes too much to continue.  
There is a 3 min cut -off, which eliminates any potential damage to the han d.  The 
participa nt is instructed to immerse his  hand in the ice water for up to 3 min, but could 
withdraw the hand at any time if the pain becomes too great.  Participants are instructed 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page [ADDRESS_375325] sensed pain.  This time measures pain threshold.  Time 
to withdrawal measures pain endurance.  
IV placement and Blood sampling:  
Minor discomfort is expected to result from blood draws and placement of IV lines. 
These procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_306584] , 
nurses, or technicians. Pressure will be applied to IV sites after lines are withdrawn to 
prevent subcutaneous bleeding. This follows standard clinical routine, and is considered 
to be a minimal risk/discomfort procedure.  Less than 450 ml of blood will be drawn as 
part of this research study.  
Autosense:  
Wearing the AutoSense belt may be inconvenient.  Participants may also experience 
slight discomfort and/or minor skin irritation while wearing the belt and electrodes.  
8. Subject  monitoring  
Participants  will be monitored by [CONTACT_44686], nursing and research staff for any 
untoward effect and the study session will be terminated for the participant if any major 
or unexpected adverse events occur. Oxygen saturation and heart rate will be monitored 
continuou sly throughout the study session.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_306498] [ADDRESS_375326] received clearance from attending study 
investigator (MD).  Any imp airment in locomotor coordination or judgment will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_306585].  The participant will be sent home in a cab 
paid for by [CONTACT_18121].   
To evaluate for the possibility of adverse events, a safety assessment evaluation will be 
conducted at the completion of the last of the PET scan / in jection  study sessions.  This 
assessment will include vital sign determination, EKG, CBC, and blood chemistry. The 
Lead Investigator or her designate will contact [CONTACT_40744], approxim ately 
one week after the completion of the study to evaluate for the possibility of any 
unexpected adverse events.  
Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they do not follow the instructions 
outlined in the protocol and informed consent form. Part icipants will also be withdrawn if 
they cannot tolerate the morphine  injection  and demonstrate any signs of untoward 
effects. Participants may also, at any time, choose to discontinue their participation in the 
study.  
9. Outcome  measures  
a. The two primary  outcome measures are:  
1) [11C]raclopride binding potential in striatal areas of the brain  
2) Subjective perceptions of  morphine intoxication and opi[INVESTIGATOR_306499].  
b. Secondary measures are:  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 24 of 62 1) levels of neuroendocrine measures (ACTH, cortisol)  
2) pupi[INVESTIGATOR_238344] , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pain response  
10. Statistical  Analysis  
 a. Analysis of data/ study outcomes  
For the primary analyses, dependent variables (subjective and objective responses in the 
laboratory, post -morphine injection  raclopride binding potential) will be analyzed using 
analysis of variance, with genotype as the independent factor. The role of drug and 
alcohol drinking history and family history of drug abuse/ alcoholism as well as self -
reports of ancestry and genetically derived ancestry scores will be e valuated as covariates 
in the analysis. The level of significance will be set at 0.05.  
PET Analysis will be based on a Region of Interest (ROI) methodology. MR I scans will 
be performed on each participant , and co -registered with the participant ’s PET scans . 
ROIs will be drawn in the nucleus accumbens, dorsal and ventral caudate and putamen, 
these being the main areas of post -synaptic dopamine release.  An ROI will also be 
placed on the cerebellum as this region is thought to be devoid of dopamine receptors and 
is used as the reference region because it provides a measure of nonspecific binding 
(Lammertsma and Hume 1 996).  Dopamine release will be estimated by [CONTACT_23992] 
[11C]raclopride binding potential derived using a bolus injection and the simplified 
reference tissue model (SRTM) under two different conditions (baseline vs. morphine ) 
during separate scans conducte d in randomized order.  
Baseline binding potential, changes in binding potential following morphine challenge, 
and subjective effects of the challenge  as measured by [CONTACT_306586] ( opi[INVESTIGATOR_306500]. 
placebo) will be correlated.   
a. Power analysis  
Sample size:  
In a study that evaluated the effect of remifentanil administration on D2 dopamine 
receptor availability using a different PET radioligand in detoxified alcohol dependent 
participants (N=11) and controls (N=11) found a significantly reduced dopamine D2/3 
receptor availability after administration compared with baseline in the ventral striatum 
(9.5%)  and the dorsal putamen (8.3%)  in both groups (Spreckelmeyer et al. 2011) .  We 
can expect similar reductions due to DA release after morphine in one or both research 
groups (118A homozy gotes; 118GX).  A study that evaluated the effect of the variants of 
the OPRM1 genotype in social drin kers compared during placebo and alcohol infusions 
found a significantly greater DA release as measured by binding potential in those 
participants who carried the G allele (N=12) compared to the 118 homozygotes (N=16) 
(Ramchandani et al. 2011) .  However, results of the studies in the humanized mouse 
strains of thes e two genotypes yielded opposite effects of genotype on DA release from 
morphine.  
If the results of this study yield similar results, [ADDRESS_375327], taking into account screening/ dropouts

11. Human  Subjects Protection  
a. Subject selection  
This study will be conducted in healthy 21-55 year -old male participants. The 
specific i nclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in a previous section.  
Females will not be recruited .  As this study aims to examine whether OPRM1 
A118G variation moderates the mesolimbic DA response to µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_306501] , it is important that we hav e a signal that could be modified . Using non -
human primates, it was previously found that the rhesus ortholog of the human 
OPRM1 A118G SNP only moderated alcohol -induced psychomotor stimulation 

  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 26 of 62 (a marker of mesolimbic DA activation) in males but not in fem ales (Barr et al. 
2007) . This difference was presumably due to the negligible overall psychomotor 
response in the latter group. In agreement with tho se observations, a subsequent 
human PET study (Urban et al. 2010)  found only marginal alcohol -induced DA 
release, (measured as % change in [11C]raclopride binding potential ) in females 
while a robust response w as present in males. Alcohol activates mesolimbic DA 
neurons indirectly, through release of endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_306462] µ-
opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328] (Heilig et al. 2011;Urban et al. 2010) . Because endogenous 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_306502] 
(Mitchell et al. 2012) , it must be concluded that the observed sex differences are 
likely to be postsynaptic. A similar sexual  dimorphism is therefore likely to exist 
for actions of an exogenous µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2641]. Taken together, these observations 
thus make it unlikely that the hypothesis of the present study can be addressed in 
females, providing a compelling scientific rational e for restricting recruitment to 
males.  
Participants will be recruited through advertisement in local media (electronic and 
print) at NIH and in the greater Baltimore and Washington DC area s. The study 
will be open to all racial and ethnic groups, without targeting any specific group.

13. Summary / classification of risk:  
This study is classified as “more than minimal risk”.  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 29 of 62 The overall risk of participation in this study is low, and e very precaution and protection 
to minimize any risks will be taken as described in a previous section. The study is 
expected to provide important information about the pharmacological effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] , 
and the role of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736] (OPRM 1) polymorp hism, in humans. We believe the 
benefit:risk ratio of the proposed study is favorable.  
14. Consent  documents and process  
a. Designation of those obtaining consent  
Study investigators designated as able to obtain consent in section 11f above will obtain 
inform ed consent.  
b. Consent procedures  
All participants  will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension 
of the purposes, procedures and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research 
participants. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written 
consent form and ask questions regarding this study prior to signing.  
c. Consent documents  
The consent form contains all required elements.   We will use an “Evaluation to Sign 
Consent” which has been tailore d to this protocol in lieu of a consent quiz as the method 
to ensure participant understanding of the study.   
15. Data and Safety monitoring  
a. Data and Safety Monitor  
This is a small, single -site Phase 2a / physiologic study  of short duration. It is carried  out 
in healthy research volunteers, a population that is neither vulnerable, nor at elevated risk 
for death or other serious outcomes. The study involves administration of morphine, an 
FDA approved medication, at a dose that is at the high end, but within  the range of what 
is recommended on the FDA approved label. Accordingly, previous studies administering 
this dose to healthy research volunteers have not reported any serious adverse events.  
Although t he study therefore does not meet any of the FDA crite ria (FDA 2013)  for the 
need for a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), we will utilize the standard 
DSMB for protocols reviewed by [CONTACT_306589] I RB.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_306504].   
b. Data and safety monitoring plan  
Data and safety monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_978], the MAI, and the DSMB for 
Addictions IRB, which will have access to unblinde d data.  
Data to be monitored   
1) Participant accrual  
2) Safety data  
3) Adverse events; serious, nonserious, expected, and unexpected  
4) Study dropout, including the reason(s) for dropout (adverse 
event, treatment failure, etc.)  
Materials submitted to the DSMB  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page [ADDRESS_375336] 5 participants in each 
group.  The purpose of this analysis is to ens ure that dopamine release as 
evidenced by a reduction in binding potential for [11C]raclopride by [CONTACT_306590], at least in those participants who are homozygous for the A 
allele .  If no participant (regardless of genotype) exhibits d opamine release, the 
study will be stopped.  I f an alternative approach to the study is deemed more 
likely to allow the measurement dopamine release, such as the use of a different 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_306505], a revised protocol may be submitted.  
DSMB Reports  
The DSMB will make findings and interpret the data, then report to the PI, IRB, 
and Clinical Director about continuation, modification, suspension, or termination 
of the protocol based on observed beneficial or adverse effects of the 
experimen tal treatment under study.  The DSMB will act promptly on any 
findings indicating the need for an amendment to the protocol or affecting the 
continuation of the protocol.  
Review Schedule  
The DSMB will examine the safety data after the first [ADDRESS_375337] 
completed the study. Additional reviews will occur each time the number of study 
completers (or dropouts) has increased by 20.  Additional reviews will be 
conducted if warranted by [CONTACT_306591] y by [CONTACT_4318].  
c. Criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_306506] (80) of participants  who complete the study .  The study will be stopped 
prior to that p oint if an interim analysis does not show any effect of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_306507].  If there are any serious adverse events 
following the administration of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_306508], the 
protocol will be su spended until the safety of continuing the protocol can be 
established or stopped if the safety of continuing the protocol cannot be 
established.  
16. Quality Assurance  
a. Quality assurance monitor  
The Principal Investigator, Lead Investigator and the MAI will be monitoring data 
collection and the study on an ongoing basis.  Quality assurance (QA) will be performed 
by [CONTACT_306592] . 
b. Quality assurance plan  
Quality assurance, including monitoring of Compliance with Good Clinical Practice  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 31 of 62 standards, will be carried out by [CONTACT_306593] . Monitors  will review 
individual Clinical Research Files and establish their agreement with relevant source 
documents , will review the study Regulatory Binder for completeness and relevant 
updates, and will confirm compliance with all regulatory requirements including 
appropriate reporting of AE’s. Monitors will bring any deficiencies encountered to the 
attention of the PI,and will follow up on these through resolution.  
17. Adverse  event reporting  
Serious or unexpected adverse events and other unanticipated problems will be reported 
orally as soon as possible and in writing within [ADDRESS_375338] 
at the NIAAA/LCTS and NIDA intramural program s to protect electronic repositories of 
patient data as well as other clinical patient related material. It is reasonably expected that 
these safeguards will protect participants' medical and personal health information, 
ensuring their privacy.    
Information obtained in the course of being screened for or participating in this protocol 
will become part of the patie nt's NIH medical record. This includes potentially sensitive 
information, such as urine tests positive for illicit drugs. Access to this information may 
be requested by [CONTACT_26404]. Such access will not be granted without the explicit, written 
consent of  the subjects. However, failure on the part of the subject to provide access to 
the information may in itself be to the disadvantage of the subject, e.g. in the case of a 
potential employer or insurer requesting the information. This  situation will be  made  
clear in the consent.  
Samples and data will be stored using codes that we assign.  Data will be kept in 
password protected computers.  Samples will be kept in locked storage.  Only study 
personnel  will have access to the samples and data.  
20. Conflict  of Interest  
Statement of conflict of interest of investigators:  
NIH guidelines on conflict of interest have been distributed to all investigators. There are 
no conflicts -of-interest to report.   There is no commercial sponsor or company for this

Individual probe placements in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dialysate DA levels in response to 
systemic morphine (3’ 10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) in h/mOPRM1 -118AA and h/mOPRM1 -118GG mice.  
Repeated measures AN OVA (with genotype as a between -factor and drug doses and time as within -factors) 
conducted for DA time course data showed significant main effect of dose ( F(3,6) = 34.6; p < 0.001)  and 
genotype ( F(1,6) = 8.98; p = 0.024) , indicating that NAc DA increased dose -dependently following morphine 
injections and overall response was different between two genotypes. Repeated measures ANOVA 
(genotype – between -factor, dose – within -factor) conducted for area under the curve (AUC) DA data 
revealed significant main ef fect of genotype ( F(1,14) = 4.38; p = 0.05)  and dose x genotype interaction ( F(2,14) 
= 4.06; p = 0.037), as well as significant simple effect of genotype for DA response to the second drug dose 
(F(1,14) = 7.31; p = 0.02).  Overall, these results indicate th at NAc DA response to systemic morphine was 
significantly reduced in h/mOPRM1 -118GG genotype as compared with h/mOPRM1 -118AA genotype.  
Repeated measures ANOVA (genotype – between -factor, dose and time – within -factors) conducted for 
LMA time course data re vealed significant main effect of dose ( F(3,18) = 62.5; p < 0.001) and dose x genotype 
interaction ( F(3,18) = 3.62; p = 0.05). Repeated measures ANOVA (genotype – between -factor, dose – within -
factor) conducted for LMA AUC data also showed significant main  effect of dose ( F(2,18) = 68.9; p < 0.001)  
and dose x genotype interaction ( F(2,18) = 4.5; p = 0.035) ; however, simple effects of genotype for each dose 
separately were not significant. Overall , these results indicate that systemic morphine administration  dose -
dependently increased LMA and these increases were reduced in h/mOPRM1 -118GG  genotype as 
compared with h/mOPRM1 -118AA genotype.

National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Individuals admitted 
to (1SE) take part in clinical research studies with the National Institute on Alc ohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This information has 
been prepared for you to help you adjust to our inpatient research setting. You will also receive a 
general Welcome Book when you are admitted to 1SE to  help address any other questions you 
may have concerning your stay with us. Your specific protocol consent form will identify and 
explain what research activities you will be involved in. Thank you for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_306536].  
General Unit Information  
Overview  
 (1SE) is set up as a therapeutic alcohol treatment program. This treatment program is 
approximately a month long and involves many structured activities that are focused on 
alcoholism recovery.  As a non -treatment seeking research participant, you are a guest in this 
community, and will not be participating in the recovery program.  
You will be on [ADDRESS_375355] time to fill. Please think ahead and bring 
items (for example, personal computers and DVD players) to use this time comfortably. Our 
Recreational T herapy staff may provide some diversional activities.  
You will be accompanied by a member of our research or nursing team at all times while off the 
unit. We provide you with this extra attention to make sure that the research is done the same 
way with eac h of you. This allows the scientists to compare your results with confidence to that 
of all of the other participants, thus maintaining the integrity of our research protocols.  
Medications from Home  
As part of our safety routines, we ask all research part icipants to tell us what medications that 
they are taking on admission.  If you bring any of your medication with you, your nurse will 
collect it from you and store it in a secure location until your discharge. While you are an 
inpatient, all of your medic ations will be dispensed by [CONTACT_306600], including your own 
medications as well as the study medication(s) which may be part of your research protocol. 
Because of our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], you will not be allowed to keep any medication in your room.          
Sharps Objects and Toiletries  
Upon admission your personal belongings will be searched. For everyone’s safety, no sharp 
objects such as razors, nail clippers, knives or keys can be kept in your room. Personal care items 
containing alcohol such as after -shave lotions, colognes, and perfumes also will be stored in the 
nurses’ station. You may ask for them when you need them for short -term use, and return them 
to a nurse after each use. Your belongings will be returned to you upon discharge.  
Activity/Privilege L evels  
Because (1 SE) is a locked unit, your ability to leave the unit is dependent on your 
physical/mental status and the requirements of your research protocol. The 1SE privilege levels 
are as follows:  Level 1 – Restricted to Unit, Level 2 – Staff Accomp anied while off the unit, 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 9.21.11)    
page 58 of 62 Level 3 – May leave the unit alone in the CRC or on the NIH Grounds. All patients are required 
to sign out and sign back in upon return to the unit.  
Smoking Policy  
NIH is a smoke free campus. However, (1 SE) patients are permitte d to smoke if they have a 
Physician’s order, in a restricted area designated only for smoking. Your Nurse will show you 
where this is located should you be interested. Please be aware that your research protocol 
requirements may limit your ability to smoke . 
Food  
For regular meals, you will have a choice of menus. You may eat your meals in your room or at 
the communal tables in the day room area. Visitors may bring food items to you but they must be 
checked by [CONTACT_60397]. Please be aware that certain research protocols have dietary 
requirements that impact the type of diet you might be on as well as the times that you may eat. 
This type of specific dietary information is covered in your protocol consent form. Research staff 
will also review this inform ation with you individually. Generally, meals are served at the 
following times: Breakfast: 7:30 AM -8:00 AM, Lunch: 11:30 AM – 12:15 PM, Dinner: 4:45 
PM – 5:15 PM.  
Cell Phones and Laptops  
You may use your cell phone on the unit. However, we ask that you d o not talk on your cell 
phone in the day room area where other patients might be involved in treatment or recreational 
activities. Additionally, we ask that you do not bring your cell phone to any research related 
activities. You may use your laptop in you r room and in the common areas.  
Rooms  
1SE has two single rooms and six double rooms. The single rooms are generally reserved to 
accommodate patients with specific protocol and/or clinical requirements. Therefore, we cannot 
guarantee that you will be able to have a single room. Each room is equipped with a full 
bathroom, a comfortable bed, dressers and closet space. The staff of 1SE will make every effort 
to maintain your privacy. However, due to unit safety requirements, 1SE nurses make safety 
rounds on pa tients every [ADDRESS_375356] any additional questions or concerns please 
ask your nurse.  
We thank you in advance for your participation and welcome  you to our research care unit. With 
24 -hour Nursing care and Research team members available to you; we are working to offer you 
a safe, comfortable and meaningful stay with us.

(including a suction device), [ADDRESS_375357] been provided to our 
ACLS physicia n to be held by [CONTACT_11384] M.D. on hand for the duration of the study session, 
including Naloxone, Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_306539].  
6. A bell will be given to the participant once in the PET Scanner with proper 
instructions to use at any point in time during the study ses sion as a means to signal 
distress in addition to free verbal expressions.

20. Electrocardiogram machine  
Plan:  
1. Personnel w ith NIH medical credentials (MD, NP, or RN) and ACLS certification as well as the 
investigator administering the tests will be in the room with the participant from 5 minutes 
before the injection until 60 minutes after the injection.   
2. Participant’s respir atory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood pressure will be 
continuously monitored.   
3. If participant’s oxygen saturation level drops below 94% for >1 -2 minutes, he will be given 
supplemental oxygen which will be adjusted to reach a target saturati on of 94% or higher.  If 
the oxygen saturation level improves, the participant will be allowed to continue the study.  
4. If participant’s oxygen saturation level drops and remains below 90% for >1 -2 minutes or his 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_306538] 8 breaths/min, o r s/he becomes sedated and difficult to arouse 
the following will be done:  
a. Discontinue drug administration if still ongoing, terminate study session, and 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_306542] a position that allows adequate 
observation and access for procedures.  
b. Administer supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_306602], adjusting it to achieve a 
target saturation of 94%  or higher If no improvement, administer Naloxone 
0.4mg IV/IM/SC   and call the Code team.  
c. Observe for signs of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_306543]. If no signs of withdrawal, additional Naloxone 0.4 -
2.0 mg IV/IM/SC may be administered every 2 -3 minutes if no response.  Given 
the short half -life of naloxone (30 -90 mins), naloxone will be repeate d if vital 
signs or participant condition indicates re -sedation prior to arrival of emergency 
personnel.  
5. If participant displays clinically significant bradycardia, hypotension or a clinically 
significant combination thereof, Initiation of the standard AC LS algorithm and  the Code 
team will be called for treatment of these conditions, i.e. atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 0.5mg IV push, may repeat 
up to a total dose of 3mg. If there is not an adequate response to this intervention, consider 
initiating the next step of the standar d ACLS algorithm, i.e. administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
and initiating IV fluid.  
6. If participant displays any of the problems above, vomits or feels excessively nauseous, or 
displays any other adverse reactions such as e.g. excessive sedation, anxiety or all ergic 
symptoms and these cannot be adequately managed, (the subject will be removed from the 
scanner [note: Clinical Center version]) any ongoing research procedures will be 
discontinued, and subject will be placed in a position that ensures free airways, adequate 
observation, and access for procedures .

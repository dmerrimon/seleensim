tDCS for Inhibitory Control Deficits: A Test in OCD. Alternate title (Consent Form): 
Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation  Augmented Exposure and Response Prevention  
 for Obsessive -Compulsive Disorder  
 
NCT [ADDRESS_134855] recently revised ( 02/16/18 ) 
 Page [ADDRESS_134856] current stimulation ( tDCS ) over right inferior frontal gyrus ( rIFG ) as an adjunct to 
exposure a nd response prevention ( ERP) for obsessive -compulsive disorder ( OCD ) patients. The 
rationale for this proposal is that effectively enhancing inhibitory control in OCD patients may allow 
them to better engage in ERP, resulting in improved treatment outcomes . The objectives will be 
achieved by [CONTACT_120450]:  
Aim 1: Establish feasibility and acceptability of research procedures and clinical 
intervention.  
Hypothesis: Patients with OCD will tolerate this combined ERP + tDCS treatment and will fi nd it 
acceptable, as determined by [CONTACT_120451] , treatment completion, and patient report.  
Aim 2: Gather evidence on preliminary efficacy of tDCS over rIFG as an adjunct to ERP for 
OCD.  
Hypothesis: Patients in the group receiving ERP + active tDCS will show greater reduction in 
symptom severity over 10 sessions of the combined treatment than those receiving ERP + sham tDCS.  
Aim 3: Characterize the relationship between measures of inhibitory control and outcome 
of the combined intervention.  
Hypotheses: a) Response inhibition, as measured by [CONTACT_120452] ( SST), will improve more 
after ERP plus active vs sham tDCS; b) Improvement in OCD severity will correspond to improved 
inhibitory control on the SST; and c) Patients receiving ERP plu s active tDCS will report less difficulty 
inhibiting compulsions during ERP exercises than those receiving ERP plus sham tDCS.  
 
B.  Background   
Deficient inhibitory control is a hallmark of many types of psychopathology, including 
attention deficit hyperac tivity disorder, substance abuse and dependence, and obsessive -compulsive 
and related disorders. As of yet, there are no established interventions broadly targeting deficits in 
inhibitory control. Addressing inhibitory control deficits is now a tractable p roblem. The 
neurocircuitry underlying behavioral inhibition is becoming increasingly well understood while, 
simultaneously, non -invasive methods of modulating brain functioning, such as transcranial direct 
current stimulation (tDCS) are seeing a resurgence  in both clinical and research settings. The time is 
right to begin leveraging findings in neuroscience to develop a neurocircuit -based method to address 
disorders of inhibitory control.  
Obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) patients are one group with well -established deficits in 
behavioral inhibition. The ritualistic compulsions which characterize this disorder clearly indicate 
difficulty with inhibitory control. In inhibition paradigms, OCD patients consistently perform worse 
than healthy individuals on t asks requiring inhibition of a prepotent response (e.g., stop -signal task, 
go/no -go task). A recent study by [CONTACT_120453]. also found that patients with OCD continue responding 
in a way they have learned will avoid punishment despi[INVESTIGATOR_120425] t punishment is no 
longer possible.  
IRB v. [ADDRESS_134857] recently revised ( 02/16/18 ) 
 Page 3 of 18  Paradoxically (given these deficits), successful inhibitory control is also an essential 
component of the first -line psychosocial treatment for OCD – exposure and response prevention 
(ERP). During ERP, patients face sit uations which trigger irrational fear or discomfort (i.e., exposure), 
while simultaneously inhibiting their compulsions (i.e., response prevention). ERP is effective at 
reducing symptom severity for many patients who complete a full course of the treatment ; however, 
few patients are “cured” of their symptoms following ERP and many patients are unwilling or unable 
to complete a full course of this challenging treatment. Although this is the best known treatment, it 
is, unfortunately, far from perfect in its outcomes.  
Enhancing inhibitory control via non -invasive neurostimulation may improve the efficacy and 
efficiency of ERP for OCD. The right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) is a particularly promising target for 
such an approach. This region is a key node in neurocircui try underlying inhibition of a prepotent 
response. The location of rIFG makes it easily accessible to tDCS , a type of non -invasive 
neurostimulation delivering a weak electrical current (1 -2 mA) via two electrodes placed on the scalp. 
Neurostimulation via t DCS modulates neuronal excitability by [CONTACT_120454]. In healthy individuals, tDCS over rIFG improves inhibitory control 
of a prepotent response during the SST, a well -established response inhibition par adigm. Such effects 
have been seen after a single tDCS session, and when stimulation over rIFG was delivered during a 
course of inhibition training sessions over four days. We propose to extend this approach by [CONTACT_120455], i.e., ERP, to inhibit compulsive behaviors in OCD.  
 
C.  Experimental  Method  
 1.  Brief  Description  of Subjects  
For the TIES (Therapy Integrating Exposure and Stimulation) study we will recruit 32 patients with a 
primary diagnosis of OCD , aged 18 -65, with clinically significant OCD symptoms ( Y-BOCS total score 
of ≥16 ). Participants will be naïve to tDCS and will never have completed a minimally adequate trial 
of ERP (see human subjects section below for additional inclusion/exclusion criteria).   
 2.  Study  Design  
For this study we will recruit 32 patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD. Each participant will 
undergo an assessment which will include a structured clinical interview, brief assessments of 
depression, anxiety, OCD symptoms, and medication and tr eatment history. Participants will be 
randomized to one of two combination interventions: Exposure and response prevention (ERP) plus 
active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) or ERP 
plus sham tDCS over rIFG. Each group will complete [ADDRESS_134858] -treatment and one month follow -up assessment.  
 3.  Spec ific Procedures  or Treatments  
Screening. Interested individuals will be screened via brief telephone interviews and those meeting 
entry criteria will be invited to participate. After providing informed consent to trained study 
personnel, patients will comp lete a thorough screening interview which will include the following 
measures: the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID -IV) will be used to verify a DSM -IV 
diagnosis of OCD, as well as to assess for comorbid Axis I diagnoses which constitute exclusion from 
the study (see “Participants”) . We will supplement the SCID by [CONTACT_7939]  a few additional questions  as 
part of the semi -structured interview  to assess new specifiers added to the DSM -5 OCD diagnosis 
(e.g., tic -related OCD and absent insight) ; a modified version of the OCD Database ,[ADDRESS_134859] recently revised ( 02/16/18 ) 
 Page 4 of 18  structured clinical interview, will be used to gather information about demographic and clinical 
features of OCD  and assess medication and treatment history ; the Hoarding Rating Scale will be used 
to assess  any hoarding symptoms endorsed on the Y -BOCS -SC; the Yale -Brown Obsessive 
Compulsive Scale -- Symptom Checklist (Y -BOCS -SC), a [ADDRESS_134860], will be used to assess 
presence/absence of specific current and past OCD symptoms43, 44; the Yale -Brown Obses sive 
Compulsive Scale (Y -BOCS)  will be used to assess OCD symptom severity43, 44; the Beck Depression 
Inventory -II (BDI -II)45 will be used to assess depressive symptoms, including suicidality ; the  
Cognitive -Behavioral Treatment History Form  (Abramowitz, 2006) , will be used to  assess whether a 
patient has had an adequate course of CBT for OCD .  
 
Monitoring Assessments. 
To monitor for symptom 
change, short 
assessments will be 
given at baseline, and 
approximate weekly  (see 
Table 1)  during  
treatment  (for clinical 
symptoms monitoring) , 
post -treatment, and 1 -
month after treatment, 
using the Y -BOCS43, 44; 
BDI-II45 (see “Screening,” 
above); and the Beck 
Anxiety Inventory 
(BAI),46 to assess general 
anxiety symptoms. The 
Patient Ex/RP Adherence Scale (PEAS)47 will be used at each ERP session to assess adherence to ERP 
homework, since adherence relates to treatment outcome.48 Patients will also complete the 8 -item 
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ -8)[ADDRESS_134861] -treatment and 1 -month follow -up to assess 
satisfaction with the intervention. A modified version of t he Systematic Assessment for Treatment 
Emergent Events -Specific Inquiry (SAFTEE -SI) will be administered assess for emergent side -effects. 
This is a self -report measure which inquires about the presence and severity of [ADDRESS_134862] or evaluator will also inquire in an open -ended fashion about any other 
adverse effects experienced which are not listed on the SAFTEE -SI and will document the nature and 
tolerability of any additional side -effects reported. For any item rated "severe," or if the participant 
reports that side effects are interfering with daily activities "markedly," the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120426] . [Name]  MD (PI) (or covering physician) immediately and Dr. [Name]  (or covering 
physician) will provide further evaluation as medically necessary. Any item rated as "moderate" or Table 1. Schedule of Assessments

weekly meetings of study staff. Additionally, the following self-report measures  will be given at 
baseline , post -treatment , and 1-month follow -up: the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale 
(FMPS) , to assess  dimensions of perfectionism ; the Pathological Ob sessive -Compulsive Personality 
Scale (POPS) , to assess current Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder ; the Obsessional Be liefs 
Questionnaire (OBQ) , to assess dysfunctional beliefs typi[INVESTIGATOR_120428] ; the Intolerance of 
Uncertainty Scale (IUS) , to assess reactions to uncertainty, ambiguous situations, and the future ; and 
the Obsessive -Compulsive Trait Core Dimensions Que stionnaire (OC-TCDQ) , a measure of ha rm 
avoidance and incompleteness. Finally, at the post -treatment assessment, we will use a questionnaire 
to probe the integrity of the blind.  
 
Measures of Inhibitory Control . Stop -signal task (SST).  We will evaluate the impact of active vs sham 
tDCS plus ERP on a laboratory measure of inhibitory control (Aim 3). Participants will be tested using 
the SST50 at baseline, post -treatment, and [ADDRESS_134865], participants will 
see i mages of either a right - or left -pointing arrow on a computer screen. They develop a prepotent 
response (based on instruction) to press a button with their right or left index finger, congruent with 
the direction of the arrow. On a small percent of trials,  participants will hear a beep, indicating they 
should try to stop themselves from pressing the button. The primary outcome variable  used to assess 
inhibitory control  is stop -signal reaction time (SSRT), which is the estimated time it takes to inhibit the 
prepotent response. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) . To evaluate the impact of active vs sham tDCS plus 
ERP on participants’ clinical state, we will use a self -report, asking them to rate their ability to resist 
engaging compulsive behavior during the ERP exerci ses. Immediately after each ERP exercise, they 
will rate their experience on a standard VAS, a face -valid assessment of inhibitory control in the 
clinical context.  
 
tDCS procedures . tDCS delivers brain stimulation noninvasively. While cellular and molecula r 
mechanisms of tDCS are still under investigation, it is known to modulate the excitability of 
underlying cortex.53, 54 During tDCS, the low amplitude current (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 1 -2 mA) is delivered via two 
scalp electrodes.54 This low -level current passes from t he positive electrode, or anode, to the negative 
electrode, or cathode. When current passes from anode to cathode, it simultaneously enhances 
excitability of the cortex by [CONTACT_120456]53, 54 If tDCS is 
delivered for  a sufficient duration (e.g., >10 min,) these excitability changes have been found to persist 
for up to [ADDRESS_134866] in basic and systems neuroscience,54 and in neurotherapeutics research.58 A recent review of 
clinical research with tDCS40 noted that “tDCS has been tested in thousands of subjects world -wide 
with no evidence of toxic effects to date.” The most common side effects include mild local sensations 
at the electrode sites, including tingling or itching, and moderate fatigue, and headache.40, [ADDRESS_134867] recently revised ( 02/16/18 ) 
 Page 6 of 18  during or after stimulation.59 Notably, adverse effects did not differ between healthy individuals and 
patients.59 Additional safety information is detailed in Human Subjects.  
  In the present study, each participant will undergo 10 separate 20 -minute sessions of either 
active or sham tDCS in a between -subjects design. Each session of tDCS will be immediately followed 
by a behavioral intervention (see “Behavioral Intervention” sec tion below). Active tDCS intensity will 
be 1.5 mA. The anode and cathode are each contained in a 5x 5cm rectangular sponge ( 25 cm2). 
Electrode placements will follow Jacobson et al.19: the anode will be over rIFG, defined as the 
intersection between T4 -Fz and F8 -Cz in the EEG 10 -20 system and the cathode over the left eyebrow 
(over lOFC).  Small marks may be placed on the scalp with a washable, non -toxic marker  to aid in the 
correct placement of the electrodes .  tDCS will be delivered via two saline -soaked su rface sponge 
electrodes and a battery -driven, constant current stimulator ( NeuroConn DC -Stimulator Plus ). For 
those randomized to sham tDCS, electrodes will be placed in the same locations as for active tDCS. To 
simulate the sensation of active tDCS, stimu lation will be ramped up and back down over a 30 -second 
period at the beginning of sham tDCS. This “ramp up/ramp down” sham approach has been found to 
be an effective sham condition in previous studies using tDCS at 1 -2mA.60-62 Immediately following 
the 20 -minute tDCS period participants will undergo the following behavioral intervention:  
 
Behavioral Intervention: Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is a specific type of CBT that has 
been shown to be effective at reducing symptom severity in OCD. ERP inv olves individuals placing 
themselves in anxiety -provoking situations (exposure) and inhibiting their compulsions (response 
prevention). Compulsive behaviors usually serve as an attempt to reduce distress. By [CONTACT_120457], participants gain c orrective information that the feared situation is not dangerous. ERP 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_120429] a graded manner, as it will here, beginning with exposure to more manageable 
situations and progressing to more difficult situations as treatment continues. The beh avioral 
intervention here includes 11 sessions in total: one [ADDRESS_134868] be completed 
with in a maximum of  seven weeks . Between sessions, self -directed ERP will be assigned as 
homework . During each of the 10 ERP sessions, tDCS will be delivered for 20 min immediately prior 
to the ERP exercise. We selected a 10 -session ERP intervention (plus 1 session of psychoeducation and 
treatment planning) in an attempt to balance feasibility with allowing sufficient sessions t o evaluate 
treatment effects. While [ADDRESS_134869] often been used to evaluate the 
efficacy of augmentation of ERP with pha rmacoth erapy  including D -cycloserine (Kushner et al., 2007; 
Storch et al., 2010; Wilhelm et al., 2008). All sessions will be audio recorded  using digital voice 
recorders  in order to assess for treatment fidelity.  As stated below, 15% of sessions will be re viewed to 
ensure adherence to the treatment protocol . In order to obtain an unbiased assessment of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120430], participants will not be allowed to opt out of session recording. (Handling 
of digital audio recordings to protect ag ainst loss of confidentiality and privacy is outlined below 
under III. Human Subjects.)  
 
Assessment Training and Monitoring of Treatment Integrity. Assessments will be completed by a 
trained, supervised, advanced (i.e., BA or higher) evaluator who will be kept blind to participant’s 
group assignment. The evaluator will initially be trained to an inter -rater reliability of ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_134870] recently revised ( 02/16/18 ) 
 Page 7 of 18  ensure fidelity to the intervention and consistency between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120431] -going cases. 
Treatment sessions will be  audio  recorded and a randomly selected 15% of session s will be reviewed 
to ensure adherence to the treatment protocol.  
 
Participant Withdrawal. Participants may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following 
reasons: 1) A significantly deteriorating clinical course, such as the emergence of active sui cidal 
ideation or a need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 2) Significant adverse reaction to tDCS, assessed using a 
modified version of the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE), 3) Serious 
physical illness, 4) Missing two consecutive study visi ts, 5) Initiation or reinstitution of other 
treatment (psychosocial treatment with proven efficacy, psychotropic medication changes) during the 
acute treatment phase, 6) Investigators’ decision that withdrawal from the study is in the participant’s 
best interest, 7) Participant’s decision to withdraw. Reasons for withdrawal will be documented, 
participants will be referred for appropriate treatment, and we will make every attempt to conduct 
scheduled follow -ups with those who withdraw. The current study wil l employ several measures to 
minimize attrition, including frequent contact [CONTACT_120458]’ time for post -treatment and follow -up assessment visits.  
  
 4.  Data  Analysis   
Original Data Anal ysis Plan:  
Preliminary and Primary Data Analyses. As the proposed study is a small -sample pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], our 
primary focus will be on examining feasibility, acceptability, and direction of effects. Additionally, all 
randomized participants will be used in an  intent -to-treat analysis. We will use chi -square and t -tests 
to evaluate any differences between the two conditions at baseline on demographic and other relevant 
variables, such as initial symptom severity, comorbid depression, or patient adherence to ERP  
homework. If significant differences exist, we will covary for these variables in our analyses (though 
we do not anticipate significant group differences at baseline, as urn randomization tends to result in 
balanced samples.)  
 
Aim 1: Establish feasibility and acceptability of research procedures and clinical intervention. 
Hypothesis: Patients with OCD will tolerate this combined ERP + tDCS treatment and will find it 
acceptable, as determined by [CONTACT_120459] r etention , treatment completion, and patient report. For Aim 1, 
we will chi -square or t -test to compare treatment conditions on rates of re tention , session attendance, 
homework and treatment completion, and patient satisfaction on the CSQ -8.  
 
Aim 2: Gather evidence on prelimi nary efficacy of tDCS over rIFG as an adjunct to ERP for OCD. 
Hypothesis: Patients in the group receiving ERP + active tDCS will show greater reduction in 
symptom severity over 10 sessions of the combined treatment than those receiving ERP + sham tDCS.  
For Aim 2, we will use repeated -measures ANOVA with a between -group factor (condition) to 
evaluate differences in Y -BOCS severity between groups across assessment timepoints . Since this is a 
small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (N=32), we will also examine group means and dire ction of effects across all 
timepoints, not relying solely on statistical approaches which may be underpowered to detect a 
significant effect.  
 
IRB v. [ADDRESS_134871] recently revised ( 02/16/18 ) 
 Page 8 of 18  Aim 3: Characterize the relationship between measures of inhibitory control and outcome of the 
combined interve ntion. Hypotheses: a) Response inhibition, as measured by [CONTACT_120460], will improve 
more after ERP plus active vs sham tDCS; b) Improvement in OCD severity will correspond to 
improved inhibitory control on the SST; and c) Patients receiving ERP plus active tDC S will report 
less difficulty inhibiting compulsions during ERP exercises than those receiving ERP plus sham tDCS.  
To test our hypotheses for Aim 3, we will: a) use independent measures t -tests to compare change in 
SSRT from pre - to post -treatment between  conditions, and from pre -treatment to follow -up; b) 
compute a correlation between percent change in Y -BOCS score and percent change in SSRT from 
baseline to post -treatment, and from baseline to 1 -month follow -up, c) use an independent measures 
t-test to c ompare self -reported mean difficulty inhibiting compulsions (VAS) during ERP across 
stimulation conditions.  
 
Revised Data Analysis Plan:  
Preliminary and Primary Data Analyses. Given that this study  resulted in a smaller than 
anticipated final sample size, we created a revised analysis plan, appropriate for the smaller 
sample. Consistent with the original plan for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  our primary focus will be on examining 
feasibility, acceptability, an d direction of effects. Additionally, all randomized participants will be 
used in an intent -to-treat analysis. Analyses will focus on descriptive statistics (e.g., means or 
proportions ) with between -group effect sizes calculated, as appropriate.  
 
Aim 1: E stablish feasibility and acceptability of research procedures and clinical intervention. 
Hypothesis: Patients with OCD will tolerate this combined ERP + tDCS treatment and will find it 
acceptable, as determined by [CONTACT_120459] r etention , treatment completion, and patient report. Our 
primary feasibility outcome of interest is rates of  session  completion. Our primary acceptability 
outcome is patient -reported client satisfaction .  
 
Aim 2: Gather evidence on preliminary efficacy of tDCS over rIFG as an adjunct to ERP for OCD. 
Hypothesis: Patients in the group receiving ERP + active tDCS will show greater reduction in 
symptom severity over 10 sessions of the combined treatment than tho se receiving ERP + sham tDCS.  
For Aim 2, w e will  examine group means  on the Y -BOCS and direction of effects at post -treatment, 
and [ADDRESS_134872]. The Y-BOCS is our primary clinical outcome.  
 
Aim 3: Characterize the relationship between measures of inhibitory control and outcome of the 
combined intervention. Hypotheses: a) Response inhibition, as measured by [CONTACT_120460], will improve 
more after ERP plus active vs sham tDC S; b) Improvement in OCD severity will correspond to 
improved inhibitory control on the SST; and c) Patients receiving ERP plus active tDCS will report 
less difficulty inhibiting compulsions during ERP exercises than those receiving ERP plus sham tDCS. 
We regard aim 3 and related hypotheses to be largely exploratory. To investigate  our hypotheses for 
Aim 3, we will:   a) calculate mean  change in SSRT from pre - to post -treatm ent, and from pre -
treatment to follow -up for both conditions, and between groups effe ct size ; b) compute a correlation 
between percent change in Y -BOCS score and percent change in SSRT from baseline to post -
treatment, and from baseline to 1 -month follow -up, c) calculate  self-reported mean difficulty 
inhibiting compulsions (VAS) during ERP  and direction of effects  across stimulation conditions.

E.   Training  of Research  Personnel  
All research personnel will be trained to properly administer the study instruments by [CONTACT_24478] -PIs. All 
research staff will have completed research ethics training —including data management and 
procedures for maintaining data confidentiality and safety —before being allowed to work on the 
project.  Postdoctoral t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_120432] g in ERP will include assigned readings, listening to training 
sessions, role play, and weekly supervision. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120433]. A physician with advanced training in neuromodulation 
techniques (Dr. [Name]  or another qualified research physician) will oversee all tDCS administration 
and will be immediately available for management of emergent events. Prior to administering tDCS 
in this protocol, all research clinicians will be required to undergo training and demonstrate 
competence in the safe delivery of tDCS. There are multiple components of training for a research 
clinician to be qualified for administering tDCS:  
 
(1) The PI [Initials]  will provide initial didactic training to introduce concepts critical to tDCS. 
Reading materials and lecture format will be used to teach the basic electrophysiology principles that 
underlie the mechanism of tDCS for modulating neuronal activity. Visual a ids will be used to convey 
anatomical guidelines used for identifying targets for electrode placement. Theoretical considerations 
for choice of stimulation targets, electrode size and montage, and stimulation parameters will be 
reviewed (though these facto rs will not vary in the current study). Training will include methods for 
identifying and managing potential side effects from the tDCS procedure, and review of procedures 
for managing a patient found to have significant clinical deterioration that could p ut him or others at 
risk for harm.  
 
(2) Research staff will observe each of the following activities with a minimum of 3 participants: a) 
administration of a safety screening questionnaire and interviewing prospective study participants to 
assess possible  contraindications to the method; b) administration of tDCS following standard 
methods; c) “debriefing” of participants immediately following the tDCS and evaluation of any 
treatment -emergent adverse effects.  
 
(3) Research staff will have ample opportunit y to practice the various steps of setting 
up/administering tDCS and conducting pre/post treatment clinical evaluations, on non -patient 
volunteers. Practice will include role play session for administering the modified SAFTEE instrument 
IRB v. [ADDRESS_134877] recently revised ( 02/16/18 ) 
 Page 10 of 18  as part of routine safety assessment, role -play of scenarios in which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_120434].  
 
(4) Research staff will demonstrate competency in all aspects of relevant subject assessmen t and in 
administration of the entire tDCS procedure on a minimum of [ADDRESS_134878] observation 
by [CONTACT_978] [Initials] . Competence in specific aspects of the procedure comprising best practice 
standards for tDCS will be documented in line with [Name] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361] .  
 
(5) Subject feedback will be solicited to further aid training and refine the skills of research staff 
delivering tDCS in this protocol.

during study participation.  Medically acceptable birth control  inclu des: established oral, injected, 
implanted , or vaginal ring hormonal contraception, an intrauterine device (IUD), two barrier 
contraception methods (condom or occlusive cap with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository), 
or having a vasectomized partner , (10) use of anticonvulsant medications (including depakote, 
gabapentin, tegretol, dilantin, lamictal)  and/or glutamate -acting agents (including n -acetylcysteine, 
riluzole, amantadine, memantine).  
 
B.  Recruitment  and Consent  Procedures  
Participants will be primarily recruited from the [Name]  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120435] [ADDRESS_134880] recently revised ( 02/16/18 ) 
 Page [ADDRESS_134881] information, should any questions 
or concerns arise at a later time.  
 
C.  Potential  Risks    
There are relatively few risks involved in the proposed study. Potential risks to all subjects include: 
(1) Coercion . Subjects may feel coerced to participate, (2) Breach of confidentiality or loss of privacy . 
In the course of this study we will collect sensitive information which, if released, may cause shame, 
embarrassment, or distress; (3) Distress due to assessment procedures . During the assessments we 
will ask participant s about their thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and symptoms. It is possible that 
asking participants about this information may increase distress or discomfort. (4) Risks due to tDCS . 
There is some inherent risk with tDCS, mainly risk of skin irritation and,  as in a small number of case 
reports, local skin burns where the electrodes are attached. Such cases have typi[INVESTIGATOR_120436] (Palm, 2008), or after unintentional abrasion of the 
skin with alcohol s wabs prior to stimulation (Loo, 2011). Though a possible risk, skin burns are rare. 
In a recent review of clinical research with tDCS, Brunoni and colleagues  (2011) noted that “tDCS has 
been tested in thousands of subjects world -wide with no evidence of to xic effects to date.” In 
addition, we are aware of reports of a small percentage of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_120437] a daily tDCS protocol for depression  targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . 
It is unclear whether this i s a risk for tDCS targeting rIFG or with the electrode montage used in this 
study.  The most common side effects include mild local sensations at the electrode sites, including 
tingling or itching, and moderate fatigue, and headache (Brunoni, 2011; Poreisz,  2007). In general, 
these effects have paralleled those of sham stimulation. In research experience totaling 567 tDCS 
sessions, no participants requested tDCS be stopped or required any medical intervention during or 
after stimulation. Notably, adverse eff ects did not differ between healthy individuals and patients 
(Poreisz, 2007). Safety testing of tDCS has found high tolerability and no reports of discomfort by 
[CONTACT_120462] 20 minutes at either 1 or 2mA for 20 minutes (Iyer, 2005). (5 ) 
Distress due to treatment procedures . Treatment of OCD with ERP involves patients facing situations 
which make them anxious, both directly and in their imaginations.  
 
D.  Protection  of the Subject  (include measures to minimize potential risks and to ensure 
 confidentiality)  
 
D.1. Measures to minimize potential risks  
The following procedures will be followed to minimize r isks to all participants: (1) To minimize risk 
of coercion , standard procedures  will be followed in obtaining written informed consent. The 
voluntary nature of participation will be emphasized. Risks and benefits of participation will be 
explained, along with the rights of the participant, including the right to withdraw from the stu dy at 
any time. Additionally, participants will be informed that should they choose to withdraw from the 
study, this will in no way affect care they receive at [Name]  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120438] v. [ADDRESS_134882] recently revised ( 02/16/18 ) 
 Page 12 of 18  future research studies. ( 2) To minimize the risk of distress arising from the assessment procedure , 
study staff that has been adequately trained in the assessment battery will complete all assessments, 
and [the PIs]  will supervise all assessors. ( 3) To minimize risks due to tDCS , all participants wi ll be 
carefully screened prior to tDCS for contraindications to tDCS. Moreover, we will obtain a release to 
gather information from participants’ current medical providers  for screening purposes and ongoing 
clinical record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] . All tDCS  will be adminis tered by a trained member of the research staff under 
the supervision of a credentialed physician (Dr. [Name]  or covering physician). Use of an electrically 
isolated power source (i.e., battery -powered DC stimulation device) also protects against delivery of 
more intense currents than intended. Participants will be closely observed for signs of skin burns, 
discomfort, or other stress. Participants will be closely monitored to ensuring the electrode sponges 
stay moist with saline in order to help prevent bur ns by [CONTACT_120463] -to-skin contact. 
Participants will have the option of discontinuing the study at any time and will be explicitly 
instructed to inform the experimenters immediately if they experience any discomfort. The 
experimenter will inform th e supervising physician about any participant who has significant skin 
discomfort or a skin lesion after current delivery. If there is any doubt about the mental or physical 
status of an individual after testing, the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_120439] a recommendation for follow -up care, if required. Telephone or in -person 
follow -up will be arranged as needed and will not be considered a protocol deviation. Adverse effects 
will be monitored regularly using the SAFTEE -SI. This measure includes symptoms of hypomania, 
including feeling hyper, unable to sit still, changes in appetite, and sleep disturbance , as well as a 
number of frequently reported side effects in clinical trials.  Any participant judged on clinical 
grounds  to have suffered adverse effects will thus be evaluated and treated as necessary and 
withdrawn from the study , if necessary . For each SAFTEE item, participants are asked to report how 
bothersome each symptom on the form has been for him/her in the past we ek, with response options 
"None," "Mild," "Moderate," or "Severe." Additionally, a single item inquires about how much all 
reported side -effects have bothered the participant or interfered with daily activities (response 
options: "No side effects," "Mildly ," "Moderately," or "Markedly"). The SAFTEE -SI will be 
administered at baseline, once per week during the 5.[ADDRESS_134883] or 
evaluator will also inquire in an open -ended fashion about any other adverse effects experienced 
which are not listed on the SAFTEE -SI and will document the natur e and tolerability of any additional 
side-effects reported. For any item rated "severe," or if the participant reports that side effects are 
interfering with daily activities "markedly," the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120440].  [Name]  MD (PI) 
(or coverin g physician) immediately . Dr. [Name]  (or covering physician) will provide further 
evaluation as medically necessary  and we  will take appropriate safety measures such as study 
withdrawal  and/ or referral to  higher level of clinical care, if necessary. Any item rated as "moderate" 
or "moderately" interfering will be reported to Dr. [Name]  by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_120441] [ADDRESS_134884]. [Name]  
during weekly meetings of stu dy staff. Follow -up or further evaluation will occur as medically 
necessary.   (4) To minimize the risk of distress due to treatment procedures , we have selected a 
treatment which has been shown to be efficacious in reducing OCD symptoms. While this treatme nt 
involves clients placing themselves in situations which provoke anxiety, this is necessary and 
effective for clinical improvement and generally represents no more distress than in experienced in 
daily living for these individuals. Participants will be i nformed that they will be encouraged to 
IRB v. [ADDRESS_134885] recently revised ( 02/16/18 ) 
 Page [ADDRESS_134886] numbers, including phone numbers for local mental health care providers 
([Hospit al Names])  One of the PIs  or a covering clinician will also be available at all times to study 
participants in the event of a clinical emergency. All participants will be given oral and written 
information on how to reach the PIs in the case of such an eme rgency; participants will be told to 
contact [CONTACT_120464], and may be seen for an additional evaluation, which will not be considered a protocol 
violation. We will asse ss suicide risk at baseline and every week using item 9 on the BDI -II to screen 
for suicidal ideation. Any presence (BDI -II item 9 > 0) or increase in suicidal ideation will result in a 
clinical assessment for suicide risk by [CONTACT_120465] a ppropriate steps will be taken (e.g., 
creating a plan for safety or higher level of clinical care, if necessary). We will monitor clinical 
symptoms weekly using the BDI, BAI, and Y -BOCS. In the event that a participant experiences 
significant symptom worse ning (i.e., 25% increase of pre -randomization Y -BOCS), he or she will be 
more thoroughly evaluated and we will take appropriate safety measures such as study withdrawal 
or a higher level of clinical care, if necessary. Participants will be offered referral s to alternative 
treatment at study discontinuation.  
 
D.2. Measures to ensure confidentiality  
(2) To protect against breaches of confidentiality , all information collected from participants will be 
handled by [CONTACT_120466] n for Research Teams training. Audio recordings of sessions will be immediately uploaded 
onto a secure research server and deleted from the audio recording device – these recordings will be 
identified by [CONTACT_120467]. All study forms and data will be i dentified only by [CONTACT_63903], 
and will be stored in locked file cabinets or on secure research servers. Identifying information 
(contact [CONTACT_3031], name, consent documents) will be separated from the research data and be 
stored separately in a differen t locked file cabinet. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)  will be 
used for data collection, entry and management.  REDCap, maintained by [Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]]  Data Center, is a 
secure, web application designed to support data capture for research studies, prov iding user -
friendly web -based case report forms, real -time data entry validation (e.g. for data types and range 
checks), audit trails and a de -identified data export mechanism to common statistical packages (SPSS, 
SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus).  All data collected  and entered into REDCap will be identified only by [CONTACT_120468]; No PHI will be stored in REDCap.  All other computerized data, including digital audio files of 
assessments and treatment sessions, will be stored on a secure drive, password -protected, and wi ll 
accessible only to research staff. These files will be transferred to the secure drive immediately 
following assessments and treatment sessions and deleted from the digital recording device. Digital  
audio files will be labeled only with subject ID numbe r. Digital audio files will be erased at the end of 
IRB v. [ADDRESS_134887] recently revised ( 02/16/18 ) 
 Page [ADDRESS_134888] participant conf identiality are described above (section D.2.).  [The PIs]  will be 
responsible for supervision of data entry and management and training of study personnel. Hard 
copy data will be stored in a filing cabinet in one of the PI’s locked offices. Digital audio files will be 
stored on a secure server, and labeled only with participant unique identification code. In order to 
maintain anonymity in computer data files participants will be only listed with their unique 
identification code. The PI’s will monitor procedures for assuring participant privacy and 
confidentiality, and the quality and integrity of data collected.  Corrective action will be taken as 
needed.  Should any adverse events arise, the PI’s will be responsible for completing an Adverse 
Events Form and reporting Serious Adverse Events to the [Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120442]]  IRB within 24 hours of 
having received notice of the event. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_120443]. Any subsequent action will be documented and reported 
to the  [Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120444]]  IRB. 
 
This study has also appointed a data safety monitoring board (DSMB). Members of the DSMB include 
[Name]  (who will serve as DSMB Chair), [Name] , and [Name] . Dr.  [Name] , of [Affiliation] , has 
expertise in behavior therapy for OCD and statistics. Dr. [Name] , of the [Affiliation] , has expertise in  
OCD, neuromodulation, and clinical trials. Dr. [Name]  has expertise in clinical bioethics, with a focus 
on neuroethics. This board convenes twice per year (unless more frequent meetings are deemed 
necessary) and is responsible for reviewing the research protocol and plans for data and safety 
monitoring, eval uating the progress of the trial, and inquiring for further information as necessary to 
accomplish their mission, and maintaining confidentiality during all phases of the trial including the 
monitoring, preparation of interim results, review and response t o monitoring recommendation.  As 
they deem necessary, the members of the DSMB will evaluate whether the presence of side effects or 
adverse consequences are significant enough to warrant amendment, suspension, or early termination 
of the study and will inde pendently make recommendations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_120445], to amend or to 
terminate the trial.  
 
E.  Potential  Benefits  
The assessments included in this study are not intended to be diagnostic in nature and therefore will 
not be of any direct benefit to participants. Participants in the OCD group may receive benefit from 
receiving a treatment which has previously been shown  to be efficacious in reducing OCD symptoms; 
however, response to treatment cannot be guaranteed.  
 
F.  Risk -Benefit  Ratio  
Knowledge gained from this study has the potential to inform further development of improved 
treatment approaches for OCD, and futur e development of neurostimulation -based treatments for 
disorders of inhibitory control. Given the chronic and impairing nature of OCD and other disorders of 
inhibitory control, high patient burden, and high number of individuals who respond less than 
optim ally to available treatments, the benefit of this knowledge clearly outweighs potential risks 
involved.

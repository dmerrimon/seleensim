The secondary objec tives of this study include:  
• Evaluate the clinical effect of A -101 45% when applied to all treated  warts (Target plus Non -
Target Warts)  twice a week  
• Dura tion of response  in all treated Warts ( Target Warts plus Non-Target Warts ) 
• Safety of A-101 45%  
Study D esign:   
This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of A -101 4 5% vs 
Vehicle in subjects with common warts  on the trunk or extremities .  Subjects may have up to a total of [ADDRESS_764198] s will be randomized to one of 2 treatment arms in a 1: [ADDRESS_764199] study medication treatment.   
 
Safety will be evaluated based on clinical laboratory studies (hematology and clinical chemistry), vital 
signs, assessment of local skin reactions (LSRs), assessment of adverse events (AEs), and concomitant 
medication review.   
 
Efficacy will be evaluated based on assessment of each Target  and Non -Target Wart  according to the

2.1. Summar y 
Warts are benign proliferations of the skin and mucosa that are caused by [CONTACT_160815][INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) family.  Cutaneous HPV 
subtypes are a subset of this large group of the DNA papi[INVESTIGATOR_581280]. HPVs are ubiquitous in the environment and 
infection occurs most commonly through direct contact [CONTACT_581289] r the virus 
clinically (evident  lesions) or subclinically, indirectly thro ugh exposure to contaminated 
surfaces, or even by [CONTACT_160817]. Cutaneous manifestations of HPV infection include common warts (verruca vulgaris), 
palmar and plantar warts, mosaic warts, flat warts, and butcher’s warts. Common warts are 
generally small, rounded, hyperkeratotic, exophytic dome -shaped papules or nodules and are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_160768] 1, [ADDRESS_764214] commonly located o n the fingers (including periungual and subungual regions), dorsal 
surfaces of the hands, and sites prone to trauma ( e.g., knees, elbows), but commonly occur at 
virtually any other anatomical location, potentially spreading by [CONTACT_581290]/hand  lesions.  
In immunocompetent individuals, many common cutaneous warts (up to 2/3rds in some 
reports) may spontaneously resolve in less than [ADDRESS_764215] for many 
years, may be large and/or cosmetically unsightly ( e.g., face, hands), spread to distant 
anatomical regions by [CONTACT_160819], be painful and/or prone to trauma, and, importantly, 
provide a significant reservoir of HPV infection in the community, placing (especially 
immunocompromised) individuals at risk for signific ant morbidity.

efficacy, and are generally directed towards either the direct physical destruction of the lesions 
with locally destructive or ablative modalities such as cryotherapy, electrosurgery, curettage, 
application of acids ( e.g., salicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid); locally cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such 
as topi[INVESTIGATOR_160769], cantharidin, topi[INVESTIGATOR_160770] 5 -fluorouracil, or bleomycin; topi [INVESTIGATOR_160771] ( e.g., topi[INVESTIGATOR_160772], intralesional candida antigen, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_160773]) or lesion removal. Several of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_160774] -the-counter (OTC) wart therapi[INVESTIGATOR_581281] ( e.g., topi[INVESTIGATOR_160776], home freezing kits). Systemic therapy with 
agents such as cimetidine, and even local occlusion with duct tape have also been anecdotally 
reported to be effective in some cases. Wh ile these methods may achieve cure in some cases, 
many require multiple visits to a physician’s office, and may require providers with specialized 
training and the use of expensive equipment. Such procedures can be painful, may require 
anesthesia and/or an algesia, and they can be complicated by [CONTACT_160820], as well as the typi[INVESTIGATOR_17396] -surgical risks of bleeding and 
infection. No one therapy is consistently effective in all cases and, in fact, there is g reat 
variability among practitioners in the methods employed using each of these techniques with 
great variability of the  results.  
 
Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a compound that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is the simplest 
peroxide and a potent oxidi zing agent commonly used in innumerable household goods including 
chlorine -free bleaches, general -purpose cleaning products, and disinfectants. Additionally, H 2O2 
has been employed as the oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has been used in oral hygiene 
products and tooth -whitening systems for many years. In industry, it is employed in the treatment 
of wastewater. In high concentrations, it is used in bleaching paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, 
in addition to its use as an oral topi[INVESTIGATOR_581282], H 2O2 is widely employed at low 
concentrations ( e.g., 3%-6%) as a wound irrigant and topi[INVESTIGATOR_113380]/disinfectant, and has been 
in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by [CONTACT_160821] 1858.  (Schumb

complete clearance of the Target Wart during the investigation, and data from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_581283] a stat istically significant trend towards clearing warts in the A -101 40% group 
when compared with the vehicle. It was the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_160781] “[ADDRESS_764219] A -101 40% treated warts were “Near Clear” at the end of 
the four -week study”. The administration of A -101 40% over four applications one week apart 
showed no untoward effects and the treatment was well tolerated by [CONTACT_35668]. The data and 
clinical observations suggest that a larger study allowing greater than four drug applications and 
evaluating additional doses of A -101 topi[INVESTIGATOR_160782].  
 
2.2. Study Rationale   
A phase 2 clinical trial was conducted in which subjects were randomized to receive A -101 40%, 
A-101 45% or Vehicle for the treatment of common warts.  Study A -101-WART -201 
randomized a total of 98 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of common warts.  Subjects received 
up to 8 weekly treatments with A -101 study medication.   
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of the mean change fro m baseline to Visit  10 on 
the Physician Wart Assessment (PWA) and the proportion of PWA responders at Visit 10, which 
was defined as target warts judged to be clear or to be clear or mild, demonstrated superiority of 
A-101 45%, but not 40%, versus vehicle.    
Both concentrations of A -101 evaluated were well tolerated. The only TEAEs considered to be 
treatment -related were application site pain for 2 subjects (all events were considered to be mild 
and resolved on the same day without intervention) and chlamyd ial infection for [ADDRESS_764220]. There 
were no clinically significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital signs.  
A-101 solution 45% demonstrated superiority versus the matching A -101 solution vehicle (and 
A-101 40%) in physician evaluat ions of efficacy in treating target warts on the trunk or 
extremities  and was well tolerated with occurrence of local skin reactions that were generally 
transient.   Based on these results a phase 2 study comparing A -101 45% vs Vehicle is warranted .

the A -[ADDRESS_764263]/parent/legal guardian will return to the clinic with the used A -
101 study medication applicator that has been placed in a biohazardous material bag .    
 
At Visit 3-9, any Target  or Non -Target  Wart  that has a PWA grade of >[ADDRESS_764264] a P WA grade of >[ADDRESS_764265] receive study medication 
treatment UNLESS any of the following criteria apply to the Target or Non -Target Wart : 
• The Target or the Non -Target Wart  has a pre-treatment LSR grade of 3  (severe) for any sign 
or symptom AND the grade has increased compared to the previous visit.  
• The Target  or the Non -Target Wart  is, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], not appropriate for a 
retreatment (the investigator must note the reason on the subject’s Com ments CRF page).  
• The Target  or the Non -Target Wart, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], cannot be visualized so 
the Investigator cannot assess the PWA.   
 
7.6.1.  Preparing the Study Medication for Application  
To perform a study medication treatment for Target  and Non -Target  Wart s a staff member will 
select the appropriate study medication applicator  from the identified subject’s kit . The following 
instructions  outline the procedure for application of the study medication to the Target and Non -
Target Warts .  During each  in-office treatment visit, the Investigational Study Staff will be 
responsible for reviewing the following instructions with the subject/parent/legal guardian and 
ensure that they understand how to properly prepare the applicator and apply the A -101 study  
medication :  
• For the in -office treatment applications, the I nvestigational Study Staff member will p repare 
the A -101 study medication applicator for all subjects, regardless of age by: 
o Washing their  hands prior to, and after completing the study medicatio n treatments  
o Wear safety glasses and nitrile or vinyl examination gloves during the treatment; 
latex gloves are prohibited  (All subjects will be supplied with safety glasses 
and nitrile or vinyl examination gloves to be used for at home applications)  
o Visu ally inspect the applicator for damage:  
▪ If the applicator appears damaged do not use it for the treatment, contact [CONTACT_581294]: A -101-WART -203 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

7.6.2.  Applying Study Medication to Target and Non -Target Warts  on the Trunk and 
Extremities  
All s ubjects that are between the ages of [ADDRESS_764267] their A -101 study medication applied 
by a parent /legal guardian  to all Target and Non -Target Warts on the Trunk and Extremities.    For 
in-office visits, the subject’s parent or legal guardian will apply the A -101 study medication in front 
of a member of the investigational study staff to ensure there i s a clear understanding regarding how 
the study medication should be handled.   
 
Subjects 18 years of age and older will apply  their A -101 study medication  to his/her identified 
Target and Non -Target Warts in the presence of the treating physician or membe r of the 
investigational staff  during in -office visits .  The second weekly application will be performed at 
home.   
 
The following instructions will be used by [CONTACT_35668]/parents/legal guardians  applying A -101 study 
medication to all Target and Non -Targe t Warts:    
• Do not apply the study medications to eyes, nose, mouth, mucous membranes, or open 
wounds  
• Thoroughly cleanse the Target and Non -Target Warts  by [CONTACT_160830] a swab/wipe 
wetted with 70% isopropyl alcohol  
• Using firm pressure  and with the t ip of the applicator held over the wart , squeez e in the 
middle of the applicator  to apply one drop of study medication onto the Target Wart.  
Using the smaller side of the applicator  tip, move the applicator around in a circular 
motion to fully saturate th e lesion.  Apply the study medication for approximately 15 
seconds.   
• Minimize exposure to the surrounding normal skin  
• During the treatment process remove excess study medication from the surrounding skin 
using a clean absorbent wipe

8. ASSESSMENTS OF CLINICAL EFFICACY  
8.1. Target  and Non -Target Wart Identification  
At Visit 1, the inve stigator will identify up one Target Wart and up to [ADDRESS_764272] for treatment and evaluation.  
 
For this study,  the trunk  and extremities are defined as:  
• The front and back of the torso from the  clavicle to the hips, including the buttocks and 
excluding the genitals and anus  
• The arms from the shoulder to the fingertips, excluding periungual and subungual areas  
• The legs from the hip to the ankles  (including the dorsal side of the foot) . 
 
At Visit 1, each Target  and Non -Target  Wart  must:  
• Have a longest axis that is ≥3  mm and  ≤8 mm 
• Have a thickness  ≤3mm  
• Be a discrete  lesion  
• Be, when centered in the circular cutout of the provided template, the only 
common wart present (Refer to Figure 2) 
• Not be periungual, subungual, genital , anal, mosaic, plantar, flat or filiform  
• Not be covered with hair which, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would interfere with 
the study medication treatments or the study evaluations  
• Not b e in an area that may be occluded ( e.g., by [CONTACT_160834] a  skin fold).  
 
Record the location of the Target  and Non -Target  Wart on the body charts in the CRFs indicating 
landmarks and distances to assist with confirming the location of the Targ et and Non -Target 
Wart s at subsequent visits.

              ID Sticker  
Figure 2 Target /Non -Target Wart  Identification  
 
At Visits 2 -13, an investigational staff member (other than the evaluating investigator) will 
confirm the location of each Target /Non -Target  Wart  using an appropriate combination of the 
Visit [ADDRESS_764273] -copy reference prints, Visit 2 photographs and the body charts. The staff member 
will identify the Target /Non -Target  Warts  by [CONTACT_1299] 2 appropriately colored ID stickers, with 
the Target /Non -Target Wart  number written on one sticker, approximately 180 degrees opposite 
each other with the identified wart  in the center of area outlined by [CONTACT_160835].  
8.2. Standardized photography  
At Visits 1, 2 , 4, 9, 10, and 13 a  qualified inve stigational center staff member will take 
standardized color photographs of each Target  and Non -Target  Wart .  
 
The photographs are to document the appearance and location of the subjects’ Target  and Non -
Target  Warts.  The subject’s identity will not be revealed in the study photographs.  
 
At Visit 2, the photographs must be taken prior to the study medication application . 
 
Care must be taken to ensure the same lighting, backg round, subject positioning relative to the 
camera and camera settings are used for each photograph.

Target Lesion photographs.  D etailed instructions for obtaining  and managin g the photographs 
will be documented in the study specific Photography Manual and provided to the site at the 
study initiation visit.    
 
8.3. Physician’s Wart Assessment  (PWA)  
The Physician’s Wart Assessment (PWA) is the Investigator’s assessment o f the severity of each 
Target  and Non -Target  Wart at a particular time point. The Investigator should NOT refer to any 
other assessments to assist with this evaluation. This evaluation IS NOT a comparison with the 
PWA at any other  visit.  
At every study vis it, the Investigator will assess the Target  and Non -Target  Wart s and report the 
one integer that best describes the Target and Non -Target Wart severity using the following scale. 
At any visit where a study medication treatment is performed, the PWA must be  completed 
prior to the treatment.  
 
Physician’s  Wart Assessment  
Grade  Descri ptor 
0 Clear: No  visible wart.   No further treatment is indicated  
  
1 Near  Clear:  a visible wart that is less than 3mm in maximal diameter (or length)  
2 A visible wart  ≥ 3mm  and < 6 mm in maximal diameter (or length)  
3 A visible wart ≥ 6mm  in maximal diameter (or length)  
At Visit [ADDRESS_764274] a PWA grade ≥ 2. 
At Vis its 3-9, Target  and Non -Target  Warts must have a PWA > 0 to be retreated. If the 
Investigator cannot assess the PWA for a Target or Non -Target Wart ( e.g., the Target /Non -
Target Wart cannot be visualized because of an LSR such as edema, scabbing, etc.) she /he must 
report the reason in the subject’s CRFs. The Target /Non -Target  Wart must not be retreated at that 
visit, and the subject should be seen at the next scheduled visit. 
8.4. Subject Instructions  
An investigational center staff member will dispense a Subjec t Instruction Sheet to each subject 
at Visit 1 ( Refer to Appendix 15.1). 
 
Throughout the study, the subjects should:  
• Continue their routine cleansing regimen except they should avoid vigorous scrubbing of 
the Ta rget/Non -Target Warts  (e.g., loofah, back brushes, scrubbing straps, abrasive 
washcloths, sponges and cleansing pads, etc.)  
• Continue their routine cosmetics and skin care products

radiation ( e.g., sunlight, tanning beds) and use sunscreen on the Target /Non -Target  
Warts , if excessive exposure cannot be avoided  
• Avoid activities that might irritate the Target /Non -Target  Wart  
• Avoid the use of self -tanning lotions and spray  tans near the Target and Non -Target 
Warts . 
• Bring the subject instruction sheet  and subject diary  with them to each visit.  
• Follow all instructions for the proper application of the A -[ADDRESS_764275] at home.  
 
On study visit days , the subjects should:  
• When appropriate for the Target /Non -Target  Wart  location wear loose fitting clothing to 
the visit (Note: clothing that comes in contact [CONTACT_160836])  
• Starting with Visit 2, not apply any topi[INVESTIGATOR_160801] /Non -Target  Wart  
within 12 hours  prior to the visit (Note: routine cleansing products are allowed)  
• After the completion of any study visit where a study medication treatment was 
performed DO NOT:  
o Wash/submerge the Target or Non -Target Warts  for at least [ADDRESS_764276] 6 
hours .

9.1. Local Skin Reactions (LSR)  
The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s assessment of the signs and the subject’s assessment of 
the symptoms associated with irritation at the Target /Non -Target Wart site ( i.e., the Target /Non -
Target Wart and the skin immediately surrounding the Target /Non -Target  Wart exposed to study 
medication). The Investigator may refer previous photographs to assist with these assessments  
only AFTER  the PWA has been performed.  
The Local Skin Reaction signs to be assessed are:  
• Erythema  
• Edema  
• Erosion  
• Ulceration  
• Vesicles/b ullae 
• Excoriations  
• Scabbing  
 
The Local Skin Reaction symptoms to be assessed (by [CONTACT_31388]) are:  
• Stinging/burning  
• Pruritus (itch)  
At Visits 2 -13, the Investigator will evaluate the LSR signs  at the Target /Non -Target  Wart 
site(s) as follows:  
• At visits whe re a study medication treatment or retreatment is  performed:  
o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication  application  
and 
o For treated Target  and Non -Target  Warts perform an LSR assessment 20 (±4) 
minutes after the Treatment Completion  Time.  
 
At Visits [ADDRESS_764278] will assess the LSR symptoms at the Target/Non -Target Wart site(s) 
as follows:  
• At visits where a study medication treatment or retreatment is performed:  
o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application  
▪ and 
o For ev ery treated Target and Non -Target Wart site, 10 (±4) minutes after the 
Treatment Completion Time, report the average of the severity of the LSR for all 
symptoms since completion of the study medication treatment.  
 
• At visits where no study medication treatm ent is  performed:  
o Perform an LSR  assessment.

9.2. Vital signs  
Vital signs will be measured by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 9 and Visit 13 . The 
following items will be measured:  
• Body temperature  
• Pulse rate  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]  
• Blood pressu re (systolic and diastolic) after the subject sits quietly for at least 5 minutes  
• Height (at Visit 1 only)  
• Weight (at Visit 1 only)  
 
Any measure that is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], abnormal AND clinically significant  (CS 
must be recorded as histor y if found prior to the first study medication treatment or as an AE if 
found after the first study medication treatment begins (Section 10.1).  
 
A systolic blood pressure >140mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure  >90mm Hg is considered 
abnormal and therefore must be defined as CS or not clinically significant  (NCS ) on the CRFs.  
9.3. Clinical laboratory sampling  
Non-fasting blood samples for clinical laboratory analysis will be collected by a qualified staff 
member at Visit 1 , Visit 9 and Visit 13 . Approximately 7.5 mL of blood will be collected for 
each chemistry sample  and 3 ml of blood will be collected for each complete blood count (CBC). 
These blood samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis.  Refer to the study specific 
laboratory manual for instructions regarding handling of the blood samples and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3930].   
 
The following tests, at a minimum, will be conducted:

The results of the clinical labo ratory tests will be reported on the central laboratory’s standard 
reports. These laboratory results will be sent to the investigator via fax.  The investigator must 
review all laboratory reports in a timely manner and note NC S or C S to define the clinical  
relevance of any result that is outside the normal range for the laboratory. The investigator must 
date and initial every laboratory report.  
 
The investigator must review the Visit [ADDRESS_764280]’s pregnancy documented and followed  as outlined in

10. ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1. Definitions  
10.1.1.  Adverse events (AE)  
• An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient that develops 
or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study of a pharmaceutical 
product and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug.  An 
adverse event can, therefore,  be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, 
symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the 
course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease under study (or any 
concurrent disease), whether or not consider ed related to the study drug.   
Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following:  
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to concomitant medication  
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre -existing conditions.  (N OTE: A condition, recorded as pre -existing, 
that is intermittently symptomatic [e.g., headache] and which occurs during the study 
should be recorded as an adverse event.)  
• drug interactions  
• events  occurring during diagnostic procedures or any washout phase of the study  
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities occurring after the start of the study (i.e., 
after screening and once confirmed by [CONTACT_15013]) that results in the withdrawal of 
the patient from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, 
or is considered by [CONTACT_160837].  NOTE: 
Abnormal laboratory test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from 
entering the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events, but 
will be recorded to monitor data  from patients who do not meet screening criteria.  
Worsening of any of the Target or Non -Target Wart  assessments should be reported as an 
AE ONLY if the use of the study medication is interrupted or discontinued or if therapy is 
required to manage the event.  
 
Protocol: A -101-WART -203 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
 
Page 43 of 57 
Version 3: [ADDRESS_764284] 
in detail to determine if there are any confounding  factors ( e.g., irritation by [CONTACT_160838], sunburn) for any such AE.  
 
The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or 
clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, s igns, 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE.  
 
Any C S abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication treatment should be reported 
as medical history, not as an AE.  
 
10.1.2.  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
A Serious Adverse Ev ent is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect  or 
• Is an important medical event  
 
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more 
severe.  
 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_160804] -patient basis, even if released the same day. Prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_160805] . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10912] a pre -existing 
condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.    
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but are clearly of ma jor clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. These 
should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emerg ency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
10.1.3.  Adverse event reporting period  
The investigator must start reporting non -serious AEs starting with the subject’s first study 
medication t reatment continuing until Visit [ADDRESS_764285] application of study medication will be reported 
as medical history.   
 
Protocol: A -101-WART -203 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
 
Page 44 of 57 
Version 3: [ADDRESS_764286] signs the  informed con sent and continues until Visit 
11 (regardless of relationship to study medication).  If a subject  experiences a SAE after Visit [ADDRESS_764287] appropriate according to her/his medical judgment.  
 
Mild  – Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate  – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe  – Incapacitating with inability to per form usual activity.  
 
10.1.5.  Relationship to study medication  
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and 
consider all rele vant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject’s 
relevant medical history, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_118199]) to determine the 
relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define the rel ationship of an 
AE to the study medication by [CONTACT_118238]:  
 
Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
study medication and the AE.  
 
Not Related  – There is not a reasonable poss ibility that there is a causal relationship 
between the study medication and the AE.  
 
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A).  
 
10.2. Repo rting Procedures  
10.2.1.  Procedures for reporting adverse events  
At each post enrollment visit, the investigator or designee will question the subject to elicit AEs 
using a non -directive question such as “Has there been any change in your health since the 
previous  study visit?”   
 
The Investigator/designee will monitor the subject for at least 20 minutes after the Treatment 
Completion Time at any visit during which a study medication treatment is performed to elicit 
AEs in a similar manner.  
Protocol: A -101-WART -203 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
 
Page 45 of 57 
Version 3: [ADDRESS_764288]’s response to non -directed questioning regarding AEs, the 
investigator or designee will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations.  
 
Any AE noted during the reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on t he 
appropriate AE CRF.  
 
AEs that are defined as “Not Related” to the study medications will be followed until they are 
resolved or until the subject’s last study visit. AEs that are defined as “Related” to the study 
medications will be followed until they  are resolved or, if not resolved after the subject’s last 
study visit, until in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome 
with or without sequelae.  
 
10.2.2.  Procedure for reporting a serious adverse event  
Upon becoming aware of a  SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or not related 
to the study medications, the investigator must:  
 
1. Take the appropriate medical action to ensure the subject’s safety  
2. Immediately inform th e Medical Monitor of the SAE:  
Evyan Cord -Cruz, M D 
Symbio  
Main Number:  631 -403-5126  
Office Number:  516 -338-0647  
Mobile Number:  516 -982-0677  
Serious Adverse Event Facsimile:  484 -324-2359  
Email:  ecruz@symbioresearch .com  
 
3. Within 24 -hours of becoming aware of the event, a SAE report form, an AE CRF and any 
other relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication CRF, medical history CRF, 
laboratory test results) must be faxed to the SAE Fax line listed above.  
4. Monitor and document the progress of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after the 
subject’s last study visit, until in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_118200] a clinically 
stable outcome with or without sequelae AND the investigator and Medical Monitor agree 
that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved.  
5. Inform the Medical Monitor of SAE updates by [CONTACT_160839] e -mail.  
6. Comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. 
instructions regarding reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)  or Ethics Committee (EC).  
 
10.2.3.  Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event  
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from study drug at any time at 
the discretion of the investigator.  If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an

Version 3: [ADDRESS_764289] be provided when requested . 
11. PREGNANCY  
 
WOCBP  include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone 
successful surgical sterilization ( e.g., hysterectomy,  bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral 
oophorectomy) or is not postmeno pausal. Postmenopausal is defined as ≥12 months with no 
menses without an alternative medical cause. Women who are WOCBP and are using an active 
method of birth control, are practicing abstinence or where the partner is sterile ( e.g., 
vasectomy), should be  considered to be WOCBP.  
  
All WOCBP must use an effective  method of birth control during the course of the study, in a 
manner such that risk of failure is minimized . 
 
 If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study m edication 
administration, the study medication must be withheld until the results of a pregnancy test are 
available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study medication and must be 
discharged from the study.  
 
If, following study medi cation administration, it is determined that the subject may have been or 
was pregnant at the time of study medication exposure (including at least 2 days after study 
medication administration) the investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor a nd 
record the event on a pregnancy surveillance form. While not an AE or SAE, the investigator 
must report every pregnancy using a pregnancy surveillance form and follow the reporting 
procedures described for SAE reporting (Section  10.2.2 ). 
 
Protocol -required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] ( e.g., x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow -up procedures should be considered if indicat ed. In addition, the investigator must report 
to the Medical Monitor on the pregnancy surveillance form, follow -up information regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed 
for a minimum of six weeks.  
  
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1. Sample Size and Power Considerati on 
Based on efficacy results from the previous study and the active study medication specified in 
the current protocol for the same indication , sample size for the current study is antici pated to 
provide greater than 90% power to achieve statistical significance in the primary efficacy 
analysis.

Page 47 of 57 
Version 3: [ADDRESS_764290] (LOCF) procedure.   A determination as to the performance of analyses using the 
Intent to Treat  population will be based on t he number and pattern of visits  missed  by 
[CONTACT_160840].   Exploratory analy ses using models specified below  may also be performed 
for separate age groups, depending on enrollment outcomes.  
 
For all analyses, two -tail alp ha will be set to 0.[ADDRESS_764291] has completed V isit 10 the database will be validated, locked 
through Visit 10 and unbli nded for the purpose of analyzing  efficacy data through Visit 10.  
Those analyses are not considered to be interim analyses as the results will be final.  Data will 
continue to be col lected through Visit 13 for all subjects,  and the full database will subsequently  
be locked for efficacy analysis ( including durabili ty of response) beyond Visit 10, and for the 
analysis of safety  and all other clinical  data. 
 
The primary efficacy analysis  will be a comparison between treatment groups based on the mean 
change in Target Wart PWA from Baseline (Visit 2) to Visit 10, using Analysis of Covariance 
with Baseline PWA as the covariate.   
 
Secondary efficacy analyses will include comparisons between  treatment groups based on the 
following:  the proportion of subjects with the Target Wart Clear (PWA = 0) at Visit 10 using 
Fisher’s Exact Test; the proportion of subjects with all treated warts Clear at Visit [ADDRESS_764292] strat ified by [CONTACT_160812]; and the mean of per -subject 
percentages  of treated warts that are clear at Visit [ADDRESS_764293] 
stratified by [CONTACT_160812].    
 
Durability of response in the Active treatment group will be evaluated by [CONTACT_160842] a PWA  status of Clear at Visit 10 which continue to

Target Warts, and for all treated warts.  The 95% confidence limits around the calculated 
proportions will also be calculated in order to estimate the population lower limit value of the 
observed s ample proportions.  
 
Exploratory analyses will be conducted using a subset of the above analysis models, based on the 
following baseline wart classifications:   warts that are determined to be tr eatment -naive vs. 
recalcitrant.  
 
12.3. Statistical Analysis of Safet y Data  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated on the safety parameters using the ITT population. The 
proportion of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events will be tabulated and presented by 
[CONTACT_581296] (MedDRA) System Organ Class. 
Vital signs, LSR scores and clinically relevant abnormal laboratory results will also be tabulated 
and presented by [CONTACT_160844]. No inferential testing will be performed.  
 
Data from all randomized subjects will be pres ented and summarized. Safety summaries by [CONTACT_160845], and changes from  pre-application values in vital signs. 
Adverse event summaries w ill be presented by  [CONTACT_118245], both  overall and by [CONTACT_7204].  
12.4. Interim Analysis  
An interim Analysis will not be conducted for this study.     
 
13. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1. Protocol Amendments  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB, except when necessary to 
eliminate immediate safety concerns  to the  study subjects  or when the change involves only 
logistics or administration.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_160806] . 
 
13.2. Protocol Deviations, Violations and Exceptions  
A protocol deviation  is non -adherence to prot ocol-specific study procedures or schedules that 
does not involve inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, and/or GCP  
guidelines.  Deviations are considered minor and do not impact the study.   Deviations include 
study procedures t hat occurred outside the treatment windows (except for treatment application 
days) .  
 
A protocol violation  is defined as any divergence from the protocol -specific inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, subject is administered a p rohibited medication , primary object ive variable criteria,

As a matter of policy, sponsor/CRO will not grant exceptions  to protocol -specific entry criteria 
to allow patients t o enter a study.  If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered 
ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular patient, prior approval from 
sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, in accordance with the Sponsor/CROs S tandard 
Operating Procedure (SOP), is required before the patient will be allowed to enter the study.  If 
investigative center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol eligibility criteria 
was entered in a study (a protocol violation), they  must immediately inform sponsor/CRO.  Such 
subjects  will be discontinued from the study,  except in a rare instance following review and 
written approval by [CONTACT_3211]/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP . 
13.3. Training  
For each investi gational center, there will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study 
subjects.  
 
It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study 
coordinators or other applicable personnel attend this visit.  During this v isit, participants will be 
trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the CRFs.  Those unable to attend the 
initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appropriately trained individual prior to 
participating in any of the procedures  and evaluations in this study.  
 
Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to 
study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), 
the protocol and other study spec ific items.  Team organization, communication and operational 
issues will also be discussed.  
 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide an investigational center file to each center.  
 
13.4. Monitoring  
The conduct of the study will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_581297], Inc. study 
monitor /CRO to verify adherence to ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, applicable 
SOPs, the protocol, other written instructions and regulatory guidelines.   
The investigator will allow the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. r epresentatives designee and/or and 
any regulatory agency to have direct access to all study records, CRFs, corresponding subject 
medical records, study medication dispensing records and study medication storage area, and any 
other documents considered sour ce documentation.  The investigator also agrees to assist the 
representative, if required .

Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study.  The data 
collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data  management system (CDMS) that meets 
the technical requirements described in US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11.  The 
CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical 
requirements of the study bef ore it is used to capture data from this study.  Before using the 
CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study specific training.  After they are 
trained, users will be provided with individual system access rights.  
The handling of data, i ncluding data quality assurance, will comply with regulatory guidelines, 
including ICH and GCP, and the sponsor/CRO SOPs and working instructions.  Data 
management and control processes specific to this study will be described in a data management 
plan.    At the end of the study, the database will be locked and the data will be released for  
reporting and statistical analysis  
13.6. Quality Assurance  
The study is conducted under the sponsorship of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. in compliance with 
the applicable regula tory requirements as well as applicable ICH guidelines, Helsinki 
Declaration, and in respect of the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and/or sub -contractor SOPs for study 
conduct and monitoring.  
Audits may be carried out by [CONTACT_160846], Inc. or Aclar is Therapeutics, Inc.’s 
representatives and inspections may be performed by [CONTACT_118247]/ECs before, 
during or after the study.  The investigator will provide the auditing/inspecting group direct 
access to all study records ( e.g., CRFs, su bject medical records, study medication dispensing 
records) and the investigational center study facilities. The investigator and study staff will be 
available and will assist the auditing/inspecting groups as appropriate.  
13.7. Record Retention  
All pertinent d ata, samples, photographs, correspondence, original or amended protocol, reports 
and all other material relating to the study will be maintained securely in Aclaris Therapeutics, 
Inc./CRO /investigator archives for the legally required duration for archivin g. 
The investigator should maintain the essential study documents as specified in ICH GCP, and in 
compliance with all regulatory requirements. The investigator should ensure these documents are 
protected from accidental destruction or disposal.  
If the Inve stigator needs to re -assign responsibility for maintaining these documents ( e.g., due to 
retirement) it must be transferred to a person willing to accept this responsibility.  The 
investigator must notify Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc., in writing, of the name  [CONTACT_542841].  
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigative site for any or 
all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the 
Sponsor to store these in seal ed containers in an off -site storage location so that they can be 
returned to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  Where source documents are required 
for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_581288] -site storage.

14. ETHICS AND GENERAL STUDY CONDUCT CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Ethics Committee (EC)  
This protocol and any accompanying material, including information that will be pr ovided to 
prospective patients (such as advertisements, patient information sheets, or study descriptions 
used to induce study participation or obtain informed consent) must be submitted to the Central  
IRB for approval .  Approval of each such submission mu st be obtained from the committee 
before it may be used in the study and must be documented in a written notification to the 
Investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, documents reviewed, and date on 
which the committee met and granted the approval.  In particular, each informed consent 
document must bear clear evidence (written, stamp, date of approval, etc.) of IRB approval 
before it may be presented to prospective (or ongoing, as appropriate) study patients for 
signature.  
Written evid ence of the approval must be made available to the Sponsor.  Any modifications 
made to the protocol and of correspondingly modified informed consent documents made after 
receipt of Central IRB approval must also be submitted to the committee for approval b efore 
implementation unless the modification is made on an emergency basis to protect the welfare of 
study patients.  In the latter case, the Central IRB must be notified promptly and their written 
approval must be obtained as soon after the fact as possib le. 
Appropriate reports on the progress of the study will be made to the Central IRB and the Sponsor 
by [CONTACT_581298] r.  The shortest time interval between 
required reports required by [CONTACT_160848].  
The Investigator at each investigative site, or his/her nominee, will be responsible for reporting 
any SAEs to the Central IRB as soon as possi ble, and in accordance with the guidelines of the 
Central IRB.  
The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting all serious, life threatening or fatal adverse study 
drug events with a causal relationship to the study drug to appropriate regulatory agencies wi thin 
their required timelines.  
 The Investigator is responsible for obtaining written, informed consent(s) from each prospective 
patient interested in participating in this study before performing any study -related procedures.  
Written informed consent mus t be obtained after adequate, thorough, and clear explanation of the

• Visually ins pect the applicator for damage. If the applicator appears damaged do not use 
it for the treatment.  
• Do not apply the study medications to eyes, nose, mouth, mucous membranes, or open 
wounds.  
• Thoroughly cleanse the Target/Non -Target Wart  by [CONTACT_581300] a swab/wipe 
wetted with 70% isopropyl alcohol that was provided to you by [CONTACT_4904].  
• Using firm pressure and with the tip of the applicator held over the wart, squeeze in the 
middle of the applicator to apply one drop of study medication onto the Targ et Wart.  
Using the smaller side of the applicator tip, firmly move the applicator around in a 
circular motion to fully saturate the lesion.  Apply the study medication for 
approximately 15 seconds.  
• Minimize exposure to the surrounding normal skin.  
• During the treatment process remove excess study medication from the surrounding skin 
using a clean absorbent wipe.  
• Ensure the each identified wart is fully saturated with study medication at the end of the 
approximately 15 second application.  
• Allow the treated w art to remain undisturbed for approximately 15 seconds.  
• After approximately 15 seconds repeat the approximately 15 second application 
process.  
• Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study medication has been applied to each 
identified wart up to 3 times.  
• Absorb any remaining A -101 study medication and dry the Target Wart and the 
surrounding skin without wipi[INVESTIGATOR_274273].  
• Document the number of times each identified wart is treated during a treatment.

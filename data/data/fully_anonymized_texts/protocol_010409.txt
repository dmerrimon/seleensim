 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement and postural disorder due to lesion to immature brain. 
Spasticity is the most common movement disorder in children with cerebral palsy  (CDC) and 
causes difficulty with walking, musculoskeletal complications such as hip dislocation, scoliosis 
and joint contracture, pain and balance issues ( Balaban et al., 2012) . Spastic muscles  are stiff and 
weak (Campbell & Ball, 1978). A combination of spasticity and  weakness in children with CP 
makes them walk difficult and less efficient. Spasticity management has been very important for 
children with CP for activity of daily living including walking  (Massin & Allington, n.d.) Using 
botulinum toxin  A (BoNT-A) injections to control spastic lower limbs became almost  first line 
treatment for children with CP to improve gait, range of motion and quality of life.  (Ade-Hall & 
Moore, 2000 ). Several studies reported that children with CP showed higher energy expenditure 
during walking compared to typi[INVESTIGATOR_336666]. (Balaban 2007 & Rose et al 1990  Steele 
K et al 2017) This increase is due to combination of the mechanical inefficiencies during 
ambulation caused by [CONTACT_336674]  (Reddihough et al., 2002) , muscle co-contraction  ((Balaban et 
al., 2012) , limited range of motion, muscle weakness and loss of balance (Norman, 2004).   
Perhaps, improving coordination of walking by [CONTACT_336675] -A may 
improve energy expenditure by [CONTACT_336676] (Wakeling et al, 2010) . Energy expenditure is an objective measure of 
evaluating the energy cost required for movement  (Rose et al., n.d.)  Generally, the oxygen 
consumption (VO2) is us ed to measure energy expenditure and one of the most significant 
markers of aerobic fitness and endurance (ACSM’s Advanced Exercise Physiology , 2006). The 
rate of oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) was significantly higher in the children with diplegia 
than in those with hemiplegia or with spi[INVESTIGATOR_336667] (Rose et al., n.d.) . 
Oxygen cost (mL/kg/m) was significantly higher, and velocity was significantly slower in all the 
groups with disability than in the healthy children  (Duffy and Graham 2014) . Balaban et al 
showed that botulinum toxin A injections to spastic gastric muscles decreased VO2 and gait 
parameters at 2-month post injections.  We hypothesized that BoNT -A injections to spastic lower 
limbs of ambulant spastic CP decrease ener gy expenditure during walking. The aim of this study 
is to investigate the effect of spasticity management using Dysport®  (AbobotulinumtoxinA ) on 
the walking efficiency , oxygen consumption  and gross motor function and gait parameters  of 
children with CP.

 2.2 Outcome Measures  
 
Primary Question: Does single event multi level chemoneurolysis (SEMLC) have an effect  
on energy expenditure and walking efficiency as measured by [CONTACT_336678] (VO2)  
and gait parameters during the [ADDRESS_416016] in 15 children diagnosed with cerebral  
palsy (CP)?  
Hypothesis: If 15 children receive SEMLC, then energy expenditure (VO2) will decrease due to  
increased walking efficiency and gait parameters during the [ADDRESS_416017]. 
 
Secondary Question: Does SEMLC have an effect on 6 minute walking distance in 15 children  
diagnosed with CP?  
Hypothesis: SEMLC will increase the distance walked during the [ADDRESS_416018].  
 
Secondary Question: Does SEMLC have an effect on the Gros s Motor Functional Classification  
System (GMFCS) classification in 15 children diagnosed with CP?  
Hypothesis: SEMLC will decrease a child's GMFCS classification due to increased physical  
function. 
 
Secondary Question: Does SEMLC have an effect on ankle musc le spasticity as measured by  
[CONTACT_336679] (MAS) and the modified Tardieu Scale?  
Hypothesis: SEMLC will decrease ankle muscle spasticity and in turn improve MAS and 
modified Tardieu Scale scores.  
 
Secondary Question: Does SEMLC have an effect on dynamic balance during walking in 15  
children diagnosed with CP?  
Hypothesis: SEMLC will increase dynamic balance during walking.  
 
2.3 Procedures  
 
Baseline (within 1 week prior to Dysport® treatment):  
 
Before initiating any study procedures the informed consent will be discussed and signed wit h 
the parent(s) of the  participants and the researcher will answer any questions. If capable of 
providing assent (>7 years old), the participant  will sign the assent form. Once the consent and 
assent forms are discussed and signed the following assessments  will be performed: 
demographics, height, weight, calculated body mass index (BMI), Modified Ashworth Scale 
(MAS), modified Tardieu Scale, range of motion of major joints (i.e., hip, knee, ankle), the 
Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life  Questionnaire (CP QOL)  for Children (9 -12 years) or Adolescents 
(13-18 years), and the CP QOL for caregivers, [ADDRESS_416019] (with mobile oxygen 
consumption), and gait analysis.  
 
Degree of spasticity/tone in the lower limbs will be measured by [CONTACT_336680][INVESTIGATOR_2547] (1). If testing a muscle that primarily 
flexes the hip, knee, or ankle joint the  investigator will place the joint in a maximally flexed 
position and move the joint to a position of maximal extension  over one second. If testing a 
muscle that primarily extends the hip, knee, or ankle joint the investigator will place the  
4 
 joint in a maximally extended position and move the joint to a position of maximal flexion over 
one second.  
 
The Modified Tardieu Scal e will be used to assess spasticity by [CONTACT_336681] a passive force (2). Two angles will be measured from each major 
joint (i.e., hip, knee, ankle): R1, the  angle in which clonus was felt during a quick passi ve stretch 
of the muscle; R2, the angle of full passive range of  motion. The difference between the two 
angles (R2 – R1) will be recorded for each muscle group. The participant will  be lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_336669].  
 
Range of motion of the lower l imbs (hip, knee, ankle) will be measured by [CONTACT_336682]’s joint to a  point of resistance where then the jo int angle will be measured by a 
goniometer. Hip flexion will be measured with the  patient lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Knee flexion and 
extension wi ll be measured with the patient lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Ankle dorsiflexion will  be measured 
with the knee extended in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. The Thomas Test will also be used to assess hip 
flexion with the patient lying in supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (3).  
 
The CP QOL for children, adolesce nts, and caregivers will be used to assess quality of life and 
wellbeing across  multiple domains of life (4). For children [ADDRESS_416020] (6MWT) with oxygen consumption measurement 
(energy expenditure)  will be performed in the Department of Rehab by [CONTACT_141968]. 
Children will be given at least a ten minute  rest between measures.  
 
Gait analysis will be measured with the GAITRite® mat, a commercially available instrumented 
mat for collection of  gait data. The GAITRite system is an electronic walkway that connects to a 
computer, and automates the  measurement of temporal (timing) and spatial (d istance) gait 
parameters, such as cadence, step length and velocity.  The standard GAITRite walkway is (5m 
long) and contains [ADDRESS_416021] is portable, can be l aid over any flat surface and requires no  
placement of any devices on the patient. GAITRite uses no radiation, electricity or ultrasound to 
measure these  parameters and is therefore a safe method for evaluating walking function, even 
during pregnancy. The system has  been validated for use in healthy children and children with 
movement disorders (such as cerebral palsy, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_336670]) (5, 6). The laboratory 
consists of a [ADDRESS_416022] if the child cannot walk without  it. Subjects will be asked to 
begin walking at a starting position located 1.5 meters  from the mat and walk at their preferred 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_336671] a termination position marked on the floor (1.5m from the  end of the mat). 
Each subject will perform five tr ials of walking at their preferred speed. We will compute gait 
[ADDRESS_416023], oxygen consumption via the breath -by-breath method usi ng a 
portable spi[INVESTIGATOR_336672] (Cosmed K5; COSMED [LOCATION_003] Inc, Concord, CA) will be determined 
while the participant performs the 6MWT  (7). After instruction th e participant will don the face 
mask and a [ADDRESS_416024] period will be given while resting heart rate (HR) and  
oxygen consumption (VO2) is measured. After the three minute rest, the participant will begin 
the 6MWT while the K5  mobile device collects gas  exchange variables [VO2, VCO2, respi[INVESTIGATOR_63760] (RER)] and HR will be  monitored via the 12 -lead ECG as well as cardiac rhythm. 
Participants will be instructed to walk at their normal walking  pace as far as they can for six 
minutes. They will be allowed to walk with any orthoses and/or assistive devices  however the 
same orthoses and/or devices will be used throughout the study. The participant can stop at any 
time if they feel dizzy or fatigued to the point of increased risk of falling. The total distance 
walked (meters) will be recorded at  six minutes . 
 
(Dysport® Injection/Treatment)  
The procedures for Single Event Multi Level Chemon eurolysis (SEMLC) with Dysport® will 
mimic those currently used  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kim in the pediatric rehab clinic (8). The study drug, Dysport, 
will be provided by [CONTACT_336683]. Dysport ® is currently FDA -approved for pediatric  patients 2 years and 
older to treat lower limb spasticity (gastrocnemius and soleus). Selected dose of medication will  
be determined by [CONTACT_336684](s), severity of spasticity, and the patient’s body weight. We 
will follow the  recommended total Dysport dose of 10 -15 units/kg per limb, not to exceed 15  
units/kg for unilateral lower limb, 30  units/kg for bilateral lower l imb, or a total of 1000 units, 
whichever is lower in a given session. The research pharmacy  will be responsible for housing 
and preparing all Dysport® vials according to manufacturer (prescribing information  sheet 
attached). The research pharmacy will also  be responsible for study drug disposal at end of 
study. Electrical  stimulation and/or ultrasound will be used for guidance of injection point. 
General anesthesia will be used to prevent  pain and anxiety in adolescents if extensive multi -
level injections a re planned. All injection procedures will take place in  the pediatric Endoscopy 
Suite (CHONY), and will be led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kim (PI).  
 
([ADDRESS_416025] Treatment)  
All procedures during the [ADDRESS_416026] treatment will mimic those conducted during the baseline 
visit (i.e., Modified  Ashworth Scale, Modified Tardieu Scale , range of motion, CP QOL, gait 
analysis, 6MWT with oxygen consumption).  
 
([ADDRESS_416027] Treatment)  
All procedures during the [ADDRESS_416028] treatment day 1 will mimic those conducted during the 
baseline day 1 visit  (i.e., Modified Ashworth Scale, Modified Tardieu Scale, range of motion, CP 
QOL, gait analysis, 6MWT with oxygen  consumption).

CONFIDENTIAL  7 11/30/20 1. STUDY  SUMMARY  
Study Number  OPI-NYXP-201 
Clinical Phase  Phase 2 
Type of Study  Randomized, placebo -controlled, double -masked study of the 
safety and efficacy of Nyxol® Eye Drops  (0.75% Phentolamine 
Ophthalmic Solution  [POS] ) with Low -Dose (0.4%) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_245439] (LDP) in subjects  with presby[CONTACT_245476] – 0.75% P OS (Treatment 1)  
0.4%  LDP (Treatment 2)  
Duration of Study  Approximately 5 to 9 days, including Visit 1  (Screening/Baseline) , 
Visit 2  (Treatment) , and Visit 3 (Safety Follow -Up Call ) 
Rationale  Presby[CONTACT_245477] -related condition typi[INVESTIGATOR_245440]  
[ADDRESS_298574] of a car. There are no current pharmacological 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_245441] , but there is some evidence that decreasing 
pupil diameter  (PD) , especially to a size of 1.6 to 2 mm to create a 
“pi[INVESTIGATOR_21828]” effect, can improve visual acuity  (VA)  by [CONTACT_245478].  
The combination of Nyxol ( 0.75% POS ) and 0.4% LDP  (Nyxol + 
LDP) could be a potential treatment option for presby[CONTACT_19555] . 
Specifically, Nyxol would be  dosed once  daily  at or near bedtime 
and LDP dosed in the morning . Nyxol + LDP dosing can 
potentially reduce PD to ≤ 2.0 mm, which has the potential to 
improve near VA due to a “pi[INVESTIGATOR_21828]” effect.  
Phentolamine is a non -selective alpha -[ADDRESS_298575] that inhibits contraction of the  iris dilat or 
muscle , resulting in a smaller pupil size.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_245442] a cholinergic , parasympathomimetic 
agent which acts through stimulation of muscarinic receptors on 
smooth muscle s such as the iris and secretory glands. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_245443].  
In a Phase 2 trial , a statistically significant number of  presby[CONTACT_245479] ≥ 1 line of improvement 
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  8 11/30/20 in distance -corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA ) compared to 
Placebo -treated subjects , with a trend for a 2-line improvement at 
all timepoints . In these studies, Nyxol was generally well  tolerated 
in the eye (most common complaint was mild -to-moderate ocular 
hyperemia) and there were no clinically meaningful systemic 
effects , as measured by [CONTACT_4701] (HR) and blood pressure (BP).  
Study Objectives  The objectives of this study  are: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol + LDP to improve 
DCNVA  compared to Placebo alone  in subjects with 
presby[CONTACT_19555]  
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol + LDP to prevent < 1 
line of loss of BCDVA  
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol + LDP to improve 
DCNVA compared to  Nyxol alone or  LDP  alone    
• To evaluate the ability of Nyxol + LDP to produce  the 
“pi[INVESTIGATOR_21828]” pupil size (approximately 1.6 -2 mm)  
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol + LDP to improve 
BCIVA and BCDVA  
• To evaluate the effect of iris color on  the efficacy of Nyxol 
+ LDP  
• To evaluate the ocular and systemic safety of Nyxol + LDP  
and each component individually  
The Sponsor intends to use this Phase 2 study  to evaluate Nyxol  + 
LDP for the  chronic  indication  of “temporary treatment of 
presby[CONTACT_19555] .” 
Design  This is a p lacebo -controlled, double -masked , multiple -dose, Phase 
2 study in approximately 152 randomized subjects with presby[CONTACT_19555] 
(approx imately  140 evaluable for efficacy ), evaluat ed for  safety 
and efficacy following  administration of masked Nyxol  or Placebo  
(Treatment 1)  at or near bedtime for 3 to 4 days,  with 
administration of LDP  or No Treatment (Treatment 2) at the next 
visit (Visit  2) in the morning . Measurements  will be made at 
multiple visits and timepoints , and analysis will consist of 
comparison across 4 treatment arms:  
• Nyxol  + LDP  
• Nyxol  + No Treatment  2 (Nyxol  alone)  
• Placebo  + LDP  
• Placebo  + No Treatment  2 (Placebo  alone ) 
Subjects will be randomized 4:3:3:4 into the above groups.  
Randomization  will be str atified 1:1 by [CONTACT_60245] .

Investigational Sites  Approximately  20 sites 
Estimated Total 
Sample Size  Approximately 152 randomized subjects, with approximately 140 
subjects  evaluable for efficacy  
Sample Size 
Justification  A sample size of approximately  140 subjects (40 for Nyxol + LDP 
and Placebo alone  arms and 30 for each of the other 2 arms) who 
are evaluable for efficacy  is needed for the study. The primary 
treatment comparison will be Nyxol + LDP compared to Placebo 
alone . Using α = 0.[ADDRESS_298586], 76 total 
subjects ( 38 subjects each in the Nyxol + LDP and Placebo alone  
arms)  
 
 
 
  
Subjects will be randomized 4:3:3:4 to Nyxol + LDP , Nyxol + No 
Treatment 2 (Nyxol alone) , Placebo  + LDP , and Placebo + No 
Treatment 2 (Placebo alone) , respectively . 
It is assumed that there will be a pproximately  7% drop -out 
between Visit 1 and end of Visit 2. To account for this drop -out, a 
total of approximately 152 subjects will be randomized into the 
study.

All of the efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed by [CONTACT_245484] -to-Treat (mITT) and Per Protocol (PP)  population s. 
Safety Endpoints  The primary safety measures are conjunctival hyperemia, 
subjective ocular tolerability  (Visit 2), and A Es.  
Analysis for conjunctival hyperemia includes  change from 
Baseline  (Visit  1) in the conjunctival hyperemia grading scale 
(CCLRU images)  at each visit, for study eye and fellow  eye. Any 
increase of 2 units in conjunctival hyperemia between consecutive 
visits  is considered an AE.  
Other safety measures include IOP , biomicroscopy, 
ophthalmoscopy,  and systemic safety as measured by [CONTACT_60231]. 
Urine pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential will be 
conducted.  
Measurements:  
• Conjunctival hyperemia  will b e assessed visually with  a 
grading scale (0 -3) using images from the CCLRU  
• Subjective ocular tolerability will be measured on a 4 -
point scale (0 -3) 
• IOP will be  measured with the Tono -Pen

CONFIDENTIAL  20 11/30/20 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Investigational  Products  
The combination of Nyxol (0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution [ POS]) and Low-Dose 
(0.4%) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_245446]  (LDP ) is to be studied for the indication of “ temporary 
treatment of presby[CONTACT_5060] a.” Specifically, Nyxol would be dosed once daily at or near bedtime and 
LDP dosed in the morning . Nyxol + LDP dosing can potentially reduce pupil diameter (PD)  size 
to ≤ 2.0 mm, which has the potential to improve near visual acuity (VA) due to a “pi[INVESTIGATOR_21828]” 
effect. In this trial, Nyxol  and Placebo  are referred to as Treatment 1, and LDP  and No Treatment  
are referred to as Treatment 2.  
Treatment 1  (Masked)  
The test product is Nyxol® Eye Drops – 0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution (Nyxol), a 
non-selective alph a-[ADDRESS_298593]  that inhibits contraction of the 
iris dilator muscle, resulting in a smaller pupil size . Note that the concentration of 0.75% refers 
to phentolamine free base and is the same —and used in place of —1% phentolamine mesylate 
drug substance, which was how Nyxol had been described in  all prior studies.  
Placebo control is Nyxol vehicle alone.  
One drop of Nyxol  or Placebo  will be administered  in each eye daily  at or near bedtime  
(approximately  8PM -10PM)  starting  the night  of Visit  1 (Screening/Baseline)  or at the appropriate  
evening  in order  for Treatment  1 to be taken  daily  for 3 to 4 consecutive  days immediately  prior  to 
Visit  2.  
Subjects  will be given  enough  Nyxol  or Placebo  for 4 doses . 
Treatment 2  (Unmasked)  
Low-Dose (0.4%) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_245446] (LDP)  is a direct -acting cholinergic , 
parasympathomimetic agent which acts through direct stimulation of muscarinic receptors and 
smooth muscle such as the iris and secretory glands.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_245447].  
For those who receive LDP, one drop of LDP will be administered in each eye by [CONTACT_245487] 0 minutes  during Visit 2. 
For those who receive No Treatment, no drop of LDP  will be administered  by [CONTACT_245488] 
0 minutes  during  Visit  2. 
2.2. Findings  From  Nonclinical  and Clinical  Studies  
Nyxol  
Detailed findings from nonclinical and clinical studies and potential risk are prov ided in the 
Investigators’ Brochure (IB ) (2020).  
Nyxol has been assessed in [ADDRESS_298594] one dose of 
Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution . The data presented below are from Nyxol alone.  
In prior clinical trials, Nyxol  has demonstrate d a consistent ability to decrease PD by 
[CONTACT_3450] 20% (~1 -1.5 mm) in both mesopic and photopic conditions . Nyxol has been 
found to be efficacious for more than 24 hours with an onset of action of approximately 30 to 60 
minutes. Key PD data are summari zed below ( Table  1).

Nyxol was observed to be well  tolerated at single doses up to and including 1.0% daily in each 
eye. This includes 59 subjects who received multiple doses of up to 1% Nyxol for at least 
14 days. Safety of the subjects in these trials was evaluated by [CONTACT_60235] ( AE) monitoring, 
physical examinations, and vital sign assessments. Across all trials, no healthy volunteers or 
subjects reported a treatment -emergent serious adverse event ( SAE ). No deaths occurred in any 
of the trials. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in physical examinations or vital 
signs, including blood pressure  (BP)  and heart rate  (HR) . AEs reported were mild to moderate in 
intensity with the most common being transient conjunctival hyperem ia and ocular irritation; 
however, Nyxol dosing at or near bedtime was observed to mitigate or minimize these side 
effects during the daytime.  
Phase 2  Trial in a Glaucomatous and Presby[CONTACT_245489]  (ORION -1, NYXG -201):  
ORION -1 (NYXG -201) was a double -masked, randomized, placebo -controlled, multi -center trial 
of 1% Nyxol compared with placebo ophthalmic solution for 14 days in subjects  with open -angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension. After screening was performed based on  inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, a total of 39 elderly subjects  (median age of 63) were randomized into the trial 
(Nyxol arm, n = 19; placebo arm, n = 20). These subjects  were either treatment -naïve or were 
previously taking intraocular pressure (IOP) -lowering medication and were washed out for 30 
days prior to dosing. Subjects  took their study medication (Nyxol or placebo) in both eyes  (OU)  
between 8PM and 10PM every evening for 14 days. Assessments were made on Day 1, Day 8, 
Day 15, and Day 16. The prim ary efficacy endpoint was change  from baseline  in mean diurnal 
IOP at Day 15. Mean diurnal IOP is the mean of the IOP measurements at 3 timepoints (8AM, 
10AM, 4PM). Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in PD, change in distance -corrected 
near visua l acuity (DCNVA), and change in best -corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA), as 
well as additional IOP analyses. Safety assessments included measurements of conjunctival 
hyperemia  (using the Cornea and Contact [CONTACT_60232] [CCLRU ] grading 4 -point s cale 
[0-3]), AE s, HR, BP, concomitant medications, and pregnancy . 
In summary , Nyxol  had statistically  significant  reductions  in PD under  photopic  and mesopic  
conditions  that were  sustained  for [ADDRESS_298595]-dosing  (Table  1). A statistically  significant  
number  of subjects  treated  with Nyxol  compared  to placebo  demonstrated  ≥ 1 line of 
improvement  in DCNVA  (63.2%  with Nyxol  vs 20.0%  with placebo) , with a trend  for a 2-line 
improvement  at all timepoints.  There  was no statistical  difference  in conjunctival  hyperemia  
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  22 11/30/[ADDRESS_298596] s, which  is relevant  to the VEGA -1 
trial. 
Regarding safety, Nyxol 1% was well tolerated and there were no major ocular or systemic 
safety issues. An evening dose regimen minimized eye redness during  the daytime while 
benefiting near VA in an elderly population. The  incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs ) was higher in the Nyxol arm compared with the placebo arm (31.6% v ersus 5.0%) but 
all TEAEs were mild in severity, with no serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to withdrawal or 
study medication discontinuation. Most TEAEs were considered related to study medication , 
with the most frequent being conjunctival hyperemia and burning on instillation ( each seen in 
16% of subject s treated with Nyxol) . Although conjunctival redness scores increased in the 
Nyxol arm at Day 8, Day 15, and Day 16, the scores in the Nyxol arm at any post -baseline 
timepoint did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference from scores in the placebo 
arm. Mean systolic and diastolic BPs and HRs were relatively unchanged and remained within 
normal range throughout the duration of the trial and were similar between arms. Neither 
biomicroscopic nor ophthalmoscopic examination showed any clinically significant  
abnormalities at Screening or at Day 15. There was no worsening of distance VA, near VA, or 
IOP.  
Phase 2  Trial in Patients With Severe NVD (NYX -SNV):  
NYX -SNV was a double -masked, randomized, placebo -controlled, single -dose trial assessing the 
tolerability and effect of a single topi[INVESTIGATOR_245448] 1.0% solution of phentolamine mesylate in 
Tears Naturale II in each eye or Tears Naturale II (placebo) on PD, c ontrast sensitivity (CS), VA, 
and wavefront aberrometry. A total of 24 patients (median age of 39) with severe night vision 
(SNV) complaints were randomly assigned 2:1 to treatment groups (active treatment, n = 16; 
placebo control, n = 8). Each group was t reated with one drop of test article in each eye. The 
primary endpoint was a statistically significant improvement in the mean change in monocular 
CS scores under mesopic conditions at each of [ADDRESS_298597] visual acuity ( LCVA ) under mesopic and photopic 
conditions, change in PD, and percent of subjects with an improvement in CS (at multiple 
frequencies), which were recorded at baseline (prior to treatment administration) and 
approximate ly 2 hours after administration.  
 
In summary, in NYX -SNV, 1% Nyxol demonstrated  statistically significant reductions in PD and 
improvement in LCVA under photopic and mesopic lighting conditions, as well as individual CS 
frequency improvements. Treatment wi th 1% Nyxol further exhibited a statistically significant 
reduction in aberration errors (errors that affect light transmission in specific PD sizes). 
Additionally, mean PD decreased an average of 1.3  mm (p < 0.0001), or ~20%, for phentolamine 
mesylate –treated patients, whereas mean PD of placebo -treated patients did not significantly 
change between pre -treatment and post -treatment. The difference in mean PD change between 
treatment groups was also statistically significant (1.1 mm ; p < 0.0001) ( Table  1). 
 
No SAEs  or other AEs were reported during the trial. Overall, study treatment appeared to be 
well tolerated. No meaningful differences in mean HR or mean systolic and diastolic BP between 
treatment groups were observed. Treatment with phentolamine mesylate caused a statistically 
significant elevation in mean change from baseline in conjunctival hyperemia  between the 2 
treatment groups (+38.6 mm versus +12.1 mm for placebo; p  < 0.0004; range,  0 mm  [no redness ] 
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  23 11/30/20 – 100 mm [maximal redness ]). The mean change in IOP of phentolamine mesylate –treated eyes 
from screening to [ADDRESS_298598] -treatment ( -1.8 mmHg) was statistically significant (p < 
0.0004).  
 
It is important to note that similar results  were found in NYX -01a2, which was a 15 -day, double -
masked, randomized, placebo -controlled trial in patients with severe dim light vision 
disturbances ( DLD ). The NYX -01a2 trial demonstrated a dose response favoring 1% Nyxol. 
Further, statistically significant reductions in PD, trends in improvement in LCVA under bright 
and dim lighting conditions were shown. Durability of effect on PD was observed [ADDRESS_298599] label, properties, and potential risk are provided in 
the IB (2020) . 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_245449].  However,  
there  is extensive  literature  on its ability,  at various  concentrations,  to reduce  PD. These pupil -
constricting  effects  are counteracted  by a dose-dependent  side effect  profile , notably  browache  
and stinging  in the eye upon  topi[INVESTIGATOR_245450].   
In an effort  to better  characterize  an efficacious  dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_245451],  Ocuphire  conducted  an expansive  review  of the medical  literature  concerning  
experiment s of various  doses  of pi[INVESTIGATOR_245452] . 
Leavitt  et al. found  that normal  pupi[INVESTIGATOR_245453] 0.25% or 0.125%  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227]  (1.7 and 0.6 mm, respectively)  but constrict  insignificantly  at concentrations  of 
0.0313%  or 0.0625%  (4). These  decreases  in PD were  found  to occur  within  15 minutes  of 
dosing  and peak  pupil  size reduction  occurred  at 30 to 60 minutes  (4). On the other  hand,  2% 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] , although  efficacious  in decreasing  PD by [CONTACT_245490] 3 mm, caused  significant  side 
effects  including  worsened  visual  field and acuity  (5). 
When  considering  the effects  on PD and the potential  side effects  of higher  doses  of pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227],  
Ocuphire  found  that a range  of 0.3%  to 0.6%  pi[INVESTIGATOR_245454] . Moreover,  based on these  data,  Ocuphire  hypothesizes  that the 
combination  of 0.4%  pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227],  when  added  to phentolamine  mesylate,  can have  an additive  or 
synergistic  effect  to produce  a long duration  of pupil  reduction  in an optimal  range  of PD for 
treating  presby[CONTACT_245491] , eye stinging,  
or browache . 
2.3. Design  Justification  
Presby[CONTACT_245477] -related condition with onset most common in people over 40 years old (6). 
Patients  experience blurred near vision , difficulty seeing in dim light, and eye strain. In young 
healthy eyes, lenses are able to focus light from objects at different distances by a process called 
accommodation. During accommodation, muscles surrounding the lens contract, causing the lens 
to change shape , thus  increasing the focusing power of the eye. This allows for dynamic, clear 
vision at both near and far distances. With increasing age, the lens becomes stiffer , which l imits 
the eye’s ability to adjust its focus for reading or for other ta sks that require clear vision at near 
distances.  
Presby[CONTACT_245492] a significantly negative impact on quality of life  (7), interfering with daily 
activities such as reading, use of computers or hand -held devices,  and seeing the dashboard of a

Limitations of Existing Treatments for Presby[CONTACT_245494][INVESTIGATOR_121321], there are currently no noninvasive, pharmacological treatments for 
presby[CONTACT_245495]  (FDA ). The 
available  treatments for presby[CONTACT_245496], bifocals, gradients, bifocal contact 
[CONTACT_13276], and multifocal intraocular lenses  (IOLs) . Reading glasses can be inconvenient and must 
be taken off and put on frequently throughout the day to see objects at far and near distances, 
respectively. Many patients express frustration with losing or forgetting their reading glasses.  
Moreover , some patients find glasses unflattering , and c ontact lenses for presby[CONTACT_245497].  
A small portion of patients elect surgical intervention, including laser treatment to achieve 
monovision and insertion of KAMRA Inlays , a plastic implant into the cornea of the non -
dominant eye to increase its d epth of field. The risks of such interventions are those associated 
with all ocular surgeries, such as a potential decrease in CS and the creation or worsening of 
DLD .  
Nyxol Opportunity in Presby[CONTACT_245498] a promising strategy and an 
intense area of focus by [CONTACT_245499]. Nyxol alone has shown in 
multiple Phase 2 trials the ability to reduce PD size by 15 % to 20% and imp rove near VA by [ADDRESS_298601] consistently demonstrated that reducing pupil size to a diameter of 1.6 to 2 mm range 
(“pi[INVESTIGATOR_21828]”) will lead to significant improvement  in presby[CONTACT_245500] (9-11). The creation of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_21828] -sized pupil can allow the eye to focus on near objects 
with less dependence on reading adds or lenses.  To achieve the pi[INVESTIGATOR_21828], Ocuphire plans to 
evaluate the efficacy of a kit combination of Nyxol (dosed in the evening  offering a 20% 
reduction in PD) and LDP  (dosed in the daytime  with an expected additional 20% reduction in 
PD).  
2.4. Route  of Administration,  Dosage  Regimen,  and Treatment  Period  
As the intended route of administration for Nyxol , Placebo , and pi[INVESTIGATOR_245455] , this is the route to be used in this study.  
The dose for one drop of Nyxol selected for this study, 0.75%, was based upon : 1) preclinical 
safety studies , 2) the results of the previous ophthalmic clinical studies  described above  and in 
the IB, and 3) cl inical studies conducted with varying doses of drugs in the same class  (12). 
Note that 0.75% P OS, which expresses the phentolamine mesylate concentration as the  free base, 
is the new nomenclature being used in place of 1% Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution, 
which was how Nyxol had been described in prior studies , including ORION -1. 
The dose for one drop of pi[INVESTIGATOR_245456] 0.4% . 
All treatments will be administered OU. 
2.5. Compliance  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and in accordance with Good 
Clinical Practice  (GCP) , the ethical principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki , and with 
the US Code of Federal  Regulations  (CFR) .

4. STUDY  DESIGN  
This is a placebo -controlled, double -masked, multiple -dose, Phase 2 study in approximately 152 
randomized subjects with presby[CONTACT_19555] ( appro ximately 140 evaluable for efficacy), evaluat ed for  
safety and efficacy following administration of masked  Nyxol or Placebo (Treatment 1)  at or 
near bedtime for 3 to 4 days, with administration of LDP or No Treatment (Treatment 2) at the 
next visit (Visit 2) in the morning. Measurements will be made at multiple visits and timepoints, 
and analysis will consist of comparison across 4 treatment arms:  
• Nyxol  + LDP  
• Nyxol  + No Treatment  2 (Nyxol  alone)  
• Placebo  + LDP  
• Placebo  + No Treatment  2 (Placebo  alone)  
Subjects will be randomized 4:3:3:4 into the above groups.  
After randomization, masked Treatment 1 study medicat ions (Nyxol or Placebo ) will be 
dispensed. Treatment [ADDRESS_298604] at or near bedtime 
(approximately 8PM -10PM) starting the night of Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline) or at the 
appropriate evening in order for Treatment 1 to be  taken daily for 3 to 4 consecutive days 
immediately prior to Visit 2 . 
Treatment 2 (LDP or No Treatment) is unmasked and will be administered  at Visit [ADDRESS_298605] from the Site Staff member recording 
measurement s/assessments.  
Treatment 1 (Nyxol or Placebo) will be administered to both eyes (OU) by [CONTACT_423].  
Treatment 2 (LDP or No Treatment) will be administered OU by [CONTACT_112746].  
The study eye is defined as the eye with worse Baseline DCNVA. In the case where both eyes 
have the same Baseline DCNVA, the study eye will be the right eye (OD). The non -study eye 
will be the fellow eye. The study eye and fellow eye will both be evaluated at all assessments . 
4.1.Primary  and Secondary  Endpoints  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent of subjects with ≥ 15 letters of improvement in 
photopic binocular DCNVA on Visit 2 at 1 hour with Nyxol + LDP compared to Placebo alone . 
The improvement in binocular DCNVA for each subject is relative to the su bject’s own Baseline 
value (Visit  1). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints ( for the study eye, the fellow eye, and binocular ) will include:

also be recorded in the eCRF.  
7. ASSESSMENT  OF EFFICACY  
7.1.Specification  of the Efficacy  Parameters  
The pri mary efficacy endpoint is the percent of subjects with ≥ 15 letters  of improvement in 
photopic binocular  DCNVA  on Visit 2 at 1 hour with Nyxol + LDP compared to Placebo alone . 
The improvement in binocular  DCNVA for each subject is relative to the subject’s own Baseline  
value (Visit  1). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints , which will be assessed for the study eye, the fellow  eye, and 
binocular  can be found in Section 4.1.  
All of the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed overall and by [CONTACT_60230]/dark irides at all timepoints.  
All of the efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed by [CONTACT_245510] s. 
7.2.Assessing , Recording,  and Analyzing  of Efficacy  Parameters  
VA and PD assessments will be measured at Visit 1  (Screening/Baseline)  and Visit 2  
(Treatment) , as described in Section 4.[ADDRESS_298629] s will be allowed to acclimate t o these lighting conditions (with 
the eyes open normally for a  to the  set of  PD, DCNVA, BC DVA , 
and BC IVA). Subject s will sit in the exam chair facing directly  at the illuminated  chart  during 
the acclimation period and for all assessments.  
Room lights may be turned on for the scheduled remaining safety assessments (e.g. , conjunctival 
hyperemia, AEs, subject questionnaire, etc.). The subject should  be in the same room for all 
assessment s, and every effort will be made to have the same person perform the measurements at 
all visits . 
7.2.1. Visit  1 (Screening /Baseline ) – Day 1 
Individuals who are potential subjects are identified by [CONTACT_245511]. The Screening Visit shall occur the same day as the Baseline Visit.

The subject will then undergo several VA measurements, including photopic BCDVA  as well as 
mesopic and photopic DCNVA (  In addition, subjects will undergo 
measurement of photopic best -corrected intermediate visual acuity (BCIVA) and mesopic 
BCDVA.  
The screening assessment will also include an ophthalmic exami nation that includes assessment 
of PD, biomicroscopy, dry eye examination with tear break -up time testing and corneal 
fluorescein staining  ( ), intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement (using a 
Tono -Pen), and direct or indirect ophthalmo scopy without dilation.  
In addition, conjunctival hyperemia will be assessed visually with a 4-point grading scale using 
images from the CCLRU  ( ).  
If all eligibility criteria are met, the subject will be randomized into the study.  
After randomization , masked Treatment 1 study medications (Nyxol or Placebo ) will be 
dispensed.  
All treatments and assessments will be administered OU.

7.2.5.  Visit  Variation  
Visit  2 may occur 3 to 5 days after Visit 1. Visit 3 occur s 1 to 3 days (any time) after Visit 2.  
8. ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
8.1.Specification  of Safety  Parameters  
The primary safety measures are conjunctival hyperemia, subject -evaluated  ocular tolerability, 
and AEs. Other safety measures include biomicroscopy, IOP (as measured with the Tono -Pen), 
and systemic safety  (as measured by [CONTACT_60231] ). Urine pregnancy tests for females of 
childbearing potential will be conducted.  
The assessment of safety will be evaluated by:  
• Conjunctival hyperemia  measured with CCLRU images  using a 4-point scale  (0-3) 
(Appendix 4). 
o None (0) = Normal . Appears white with a small number of con junctival blood 
vessel s easily observed  
o Mild (+1) = Prominent , pi[INVESTIGATOR_60207] -red color of both the bulbar and palpebral 
conjunctiva  
o Moderate (+2) = Bright, scarlet red color of the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva  
o Severe (+3) = Beefy red with petechiae, dark red bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva 
with evidence of subconjunctival  hemorrhage

The timing for recording safety parameters may be found in Table 2 . 
8.3.Adverse  Events  and Serious  Adverse  Events  
All AEs and SAEs that occur following consent and until the final study visit should be collected 
and recorde d on the AE or SAE eCRF page . Only TEAEs will be summarized  (Section  8.3.1 ). 
All AEs/adverse reactions occurring during the study (i .e., once the subject  has signed the 
informed consent ) must be documented, regardless of the assumption of causal relationship, on 
the respective eCRF. All  TEAEs/treatment -emergent adverse reactions must be documented 
from the time the subject  receives the study medication until the subject ’s participation in the 
study has been completed. If a subject  has ongoing AEs/adverse reactions at the time of study 
completion  or discontinuation from the study , the ongoing AEs/adverse reactions must  be 
followed  up and provided appropriate medical care until the signs and symptoms have remitted 
or stabilized or until medical assessments  have returned to acceptable or pre -study limits.  
Documentation of AEs/adverse reactions includes start date and end date, severit y, relationship 
to study medications , action(s) taken, seriousness , and outcome.  
8.3.1.  Adverse  Event  Definitions  
The following definitions of terms apply to this section:  
Adverse event . An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a study 
medication  in humans, whether or not  it is considered drug related . An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease 
temporari ly associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the study 
medication. Study medication includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the 
comparator product or vehicle placebo that is given or administered during any p hase of the 
study.  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investigational treatment are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test results 
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  44 11/30/[ADDRESS_298634] at each visit 
during the study. At each clinic assessment /visit, study personnel should ask the follo wing 
question: “Have you had any problems since your last assessment /visit?” AEs also may be 
detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_245512].  
Life-threatening adverse event or life -threatening suspect ed adverse reaction . An AE or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Ocuphire , its occurrence places the subject  or subject  at immediate risk of death. 
It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.  
Serious adverse event or serious suspected adverse reaction . An AE or suspected adverse 
reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Ocuphire,  it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  AE 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088]  
• Persistent  or significant  incapacit y or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  normal  
life functions   
• Congenital  anomaly/birth  defect   
• Other  medically  important  serious  event  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31437] a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition  that is 
unrel ated to the medication under study and has not worsened since the start of the study, is not 
considered an SAE.  
Suspected adverse reaction  means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigati onal New Drug ( IND) safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, whic h means any AE caused by a drug.  
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction . An AE or suspected 
adverse reaction is considered  “unexpected ” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also 
refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a 
class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
The study medication relationship  for each AE/adverse reaction should be determined by [CONTACT_245513]:  
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  45 11/30/20 • Not related  
• Unlikely related  
• Possibly related  
• Probably related  
• Definitely related  
• Unknown  
Unless the relationship is considered to be “Not related” or “Unlikely related” and there is any 
valid reason, even if undetermined , for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship 
between the study medication and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered 
“related .”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined by 
[CONTACT_245514] “Not related ” or “Unlikely related ,” the event will be 
considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory 
reporting.  
Severity  of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort of an AE as is 
determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423] . The assessment of severity  
is made irrespective of study medication relationship or seriousness of the event and should be 
evaluated according to the following scale:  
• 1 = Mild: Present, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily activity  
• 2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
• 3 = Severe: Incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
A ch ange in severity for a reported AE will require a n end date for the previous severity and a 
new start and end date for the new severity. For example, a change in severity may go from mild 
to severe  or from severe to moderate. In either case the start or  end times/ dates should be 
recorded.  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an event/reaction; the event/reaction itself 
may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache) . This is not the same 
as a “ serious” AE, which is based on a subject/event outcome  or action criteria usually associated 
with events that pose a threat to the subject’s life or vital functions. “Seriousness ” (NOT 
severity) serves as a guide f or defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form and emailed 
to , as well as in the eCRF. Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as 
an AE unless there is a suspic ion that an investigational product may have interfered with the 
effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study . 
Action  taken in response to an AE is coded as:  
• Dose  increased : An indication  that a medication  schedule  was modified  by [CONTACT_60267];  
either  by [CONTACT_245515],  strength , or amount.  

Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  46 11/30/20 • Dose  not changed:  An indication  that a medication  schedule  was maintained.  
• Dose  reduced:  An indication  that a medication  schedule  was modified  by [CONTACT_58413],  
either  by [CONTACT_245515],  strength , or amount.  
• Dose  interrupted:  An indication  that a medication  schedule  was modified  by [CONTACT_245516]  a prescribed  regimen  of medication.  
• Drug  withdrawn:  An indication  that a medication  schedule  was modified  through  
termination  of a prescribed  regimen  of medication.  
• Not applicable:  Determination  of a value  is not relevant  in the current  context . 
• Unknown:  Not known,  not observed,  not recorded,  or refused . 
Additional other action taken : 
• Concomitant  medication  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_245469] a s: 
• Fatal : The termination  of life as a result  of an AE. 
• Not recovered/not  resolved : One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  that indicates  
that the event  has not improved  or the subject  has not recuperated . 
• Recovered/resolved : One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  that indicates  that the 
event  has improved  or the subject  has recuperated . 
• Recovered/ resolved  with sequelae : One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  where  
the subject  recuperated  but retained  pathological  conditions  resulting  from  the prior  
disease  or injury . 
• Recovering/resolving:  One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  that indicates  that 
the event  is improving . 
• Unknown:  Not known,  not observed,  not recorded,  or refused . 
In previous clinical studies of Nyxol , the most frequently reported AE was conjunctival 
hyperemia.  
In the present study,  any increase of 2 units in conjunctival hyperemia between consecutive 
timepoints is considered an AE.  
Investigators are cautioned to use the appropriate verbatim term on the AE form to describe this 
observation:  
• Redness related to instillation that is transient (i .e., is no longer present 2  hours after 
instillation) = “conjunctival erythema upon instillati on.” 
• Redness that is NOT transient (i .e., is present 2 hours after instillation) = “conjunctival 
hyperemia .” 
Expedited reporting of serious and unexpected adverse  events : All SAEs (related and 
unrelated) will be recorded following subject signature [CONTACT_245534] -Up Call (Visit 3/Day 5) . Any SAEs “suspected” to be related to the study 
medication  and discovered by [CONTACT_245517].  
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  47 11/30/[ADDRESS_298635]  should be maintained at the site with a copy emailed 
to VEGA1 _Safety @Oculoscr.com . The Investigator must assess the SAE relationship and 
complete the SAE eCRF . The CRO  may request additional information. Follow -up information 
(e.g., discharge summary) will be retained in the subject ’s chart and a copy will be emailed  to 
VEGA1 _Safety @Oculoscr.com . In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the AE eCRF page 
with the serious question  marked “Yes .” 
It is the Investigator’s responsibilit y to notify the approving IRB of any SAEs on a timely basis 
as instructed by [CONTACT_245518] ’s determination of causality. All subjects  who 
experience an SAE should be followed clinically and undergo the appropriate diagnostic 
evaluations until  stabilization or resolution of the event. Ocuphire  will report all SAEs to the 
FDA on the appropriate schedule depending if the event is drug related or not drug related, 
expected, or unexpected (based on the available information in the I B). 
Any death oc curring during the study and follow -up period must  be reported as an SAE. For any 
death occurring through the end of the study, regardless of the degree of relationship to study 
medication , the SAE resulting in the death must be reported to the CRO . A death occurring after 
completion of the study including the Safety Follow -Up Call, that is not reasonably associated 
with study medication administration, does not require completion of the SA E form.  
8.3.2.  Follow -Up of Subjects  After  Adverse  Events  
If an AE/adverse reaction occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treatment as 
deemed appropriate. All SAEs  ongoing  at the time of the last visit or discontinuation from the 
study will be f ollowed up  until the AE/adverse reaction is resolved or stabilized, the subject is 
lost to follow -up, or there is other resolution to the event.  
 
9. STATISTICS  
9.1.Sample  Size 
A sample size of approximately  140 subjects ( 40 for Nyxol + LDP and Placebo alone  arms and 
30 for each of the other 2 arms ) who are evaluable for efficacy  is needed for the study. The 
primary treatment comparison will be Nyxol + LDP compared to Placebo alone . Using α = 0.[ADDRESS_298636], 76 total subjects ( 38 subjects each in the Nyxol + LDP and 
Placebo alone  arms) evaluable for efficacy will provide at  
 
 
  
Subjects will be randomized 4:3:3:4 to Nyxol + LDP , Nyxol + No Treatment 2 (Nyxol alone ), 
Placebo + LDP , and Placebo + No Treatment 2 (Placebo alone ), respectively . 
It is assumed that there will be a pproximately  7% drop -out between Visit 1 and end of Visit 2 . 
To account for this drop -out, a total of approximately 152  subjects will be randomized into the 
study. 
A diagram outli ning treatment arms can be found in Appendix 5.

Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be coded using  MedDRA.  Only TEAEs  (those  that occur after 
the first dose of study medication or increasing in severity  after initiation of study medication ) 
will be summarized . TEAEs and SAEs will be summarized  by [CONTACT_1570], by [CONTACT_70244] (SOC) , severity, and relationship to study medication. Deaths, withdrawal from study 
medication due to AEs, and withdrawal from the study due to AEs will each by [CONTACT_245525]. Note that in MedDRA, ocular events are coded to the SOC of “special senses .” 
Thus , using SOC in the summaries will provide a separation of ocular and non -ocular AEs. 
All safety data will be provided in by -subject  listings.   
9.4. Procedure  for Accounting  for Missing,  Unused,  or Spurious  Data  
For the summarization and analysis of  efficacy data, the focus will be on observed case data 
only. As appropriate, confirmatory efficacy analyses will be performed using imputation for 
missing data; details of the imputation , if performed,  will be included in the study Statistical 
Analysis Pl an. For the summarization of safety data, observed case data only will be used . 
9.5.Procedure  for Reporting  Deviations  From  the Statistical  Plan  
Any deviations from the statistical plan will be described and a justification given in the final 
Clinical Study Re port.

12.3. Protocol  Deviations/Violations  
The Investigator should not deviate from the requirements of this protocol without prior written 
approval of the Medical Monitor or Sponsor , except in the event of a medical emergency.  
A reportable protocol deviation is defined as nonadherence to the protocol that involves 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, affects subject safety, rights or welfare, or has the potential to affect 
the integrity of t he data. Examples of major protocol deviations  include study enrollment  by 
[CONTACT_60285] , loss of key data such as equipment  malfunction  (e.g., pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187]), and/or use  
of a prohibited medication during the study .  
All protocol deviations will be rep orted by [CONTACT_60286]. 
Protocol deviations should be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB -specific guidelines. If 
there is any question as to whether the deviation is reportable, Ocuphire or designee and the IRB 
should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].

Title: Academic Achievement in Children with Asthma  
Date: June 22, [ADDRESS_574697]  
Background: Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood with a prevalence that is 
1.6 times greater in African American (AA) children than in Non -Hispanic White children.1  
Nationally, 700,000 children are seen for asthma in Emergency Departments (ED) every year, 
1% of which are seen at Children’s National Health System  (CN) in Washington, DC.  School 
performance and school attendance has not been well studied in urban children with asthma, 
especially at the middle school level.  
Objective: Our purpose is to test the hypothesis that children with asthma have worse school 
performance  than middle school children without asthma in Washington DC  public  schools.  
Methods: We will conduct a cross -sectional observation al study of children in 3rd-8th grade in the 
[ADDRESS_574698] demographic information, asthma 
severity information (for cases), and request that parents mail report cards and standardized 
test scores directly to the invest igators. We will use multivariable linear and logistic regression to 
determine if the presence of asthma is associated with  school performance . 
  
[ADDRESS_574699] common chronic disease of childhood with a prev alence that is 1.6 
times greater in African American (AA) children than in Non -Hispanic White children.1  
Nationally, 700,000 children are seen for asthma in Emergency Departments (ED) every year, 
1% of which are seen at Children’s National Medical Center ( CN) in Washington, DC. The 
asthma prevalence rate among African America (AA) children and teens in Washington, DC is 
20% higher than the national rate2 and overall ED utilization rates for asthma are 4.[ADDRESS_574700] and resources available. Availability of skilled nursing differ s 
between schools , impacting children with asthma ; Hillemeier’s study of  children with asthma in 
Pennsylvania schools showed that less than half of secondary schools had adequate school 
nurse coverage, and that this reduced services provided to children with asthma.6 Children 
whose asthma is not managed at school may be absent more often.  Parental education also 
plays a part in a child’s school performance. Tsakiris et al, showed that in Greece, lower 
parental education level was independently asso ciated with p oor school performance in children  
with asthma .5  
Early adolescence (ages 10 -13) is identified as a time of  great  transition with both 
developmental and biologic changes; in this time period male children with asthma generally 
improve and female wi th asthma develop worsening asthma, likely due to hormone effects. I t 
has been shown that programs to reduce asthma symptoms in both younger children 
(elementary school) and older children (high school) do not work well in early adolescent 
children (middle  school) .7   
In addition, despi[INVESTIGATOR_450751] (NAEPP, 2007) 
guidelines that encourage the assessment of the q uality of life (QOL) in children, there has been 
minimal research on QOL in children with asthma.   
Given the scarcity o f informatio n on the association between pediatric asthma and 
academic achievement, school attendance, and the QOL, and the need to establish baselines 
within individual communities, we have designed a study to examine the association between 
asthma in children in grades [ADDRESS_574701] worse school performance  
compared to children without asthma.     
Specific Aim 1:  To determine the association between asthma  and school performance  by 
[CONTACT_450768] s (GPA) in children from 3rd-8th grade  with and without asthma. 
We will enroll an additional 60  children in grades 3-8 with asthma (cases) from the ED/ IMPACT 
DC and  compare them with a group of 60 children in grades 3-8 without asthma (controls) 
recruited from the E D.  Report cards will be collected between May [ADDRESS_574702] lower GPAs .  
4 
 
B.  
Significance:  
School achievement in  elementary and  middle school students with asthma is not well 
understood; this study will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_450752] -asthmatic counterparts.  
 
C. Preliminary studies  
We have not previously studied academic success in children with asthma.  
 
D. Research Design  and Methods  
 
We are proposing a cross -sectional  case -control observational study of children in grades 3 -8 to 
compare academic achievement and school attendance between children with and without 
asthma . 60 children with asthma (cases) will be recruited from the I MPACT  DC clinic and/or ED  
and 60 children without as thma (controls) will be recruited  from the ED . Recruitment will occur 
from May [ADDRESS_574703] (1) be in grade 
level 3-8 in the 2015-2016 school year , attend  public school in Washington, DC (DCPS) and 
reside in their school district ;(2) be accompanie d by [CONTACT_19285]. Exclusion 
criteria for cases and controls will be (1) presence of a chronic medic al condition other than 
asthma or (2)  a family that do es not speak English or Spanish . 
 
Demographic Data for Cases and Controls  
Demographic information will be obtained by a structured interview; the questionnaire (Appendix 
A) will be used on both cases and controls: the parent/caregiver will be asked about the child’s 
age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance type. health care utiliz ation, medications usage,  highest 
level of educatio n of the parent/ caregiver, income of the household , and parental report of 
school services .  Cases will complete an additional [ADDRESS_574704] (ACT) score (Appendix F and G).    
 
We will u tilize the child’s electronic medical record (Cerner for ED charts and eClinicalWorks for  
the IMPACT DC charts) to determine insurance type  and health care utilization. We will also 
determine e ach participant’s weight and height from the medical record and will access medical 
records for the period of time we are collecting report cards for to determine clinical information, 
such as number of ED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176165] 1 4 month peri od that the  report cards 
cover (August 2015 -November 2016 ).  
 
Reporting of Academic Achievement and School Attendance  
At the time of recruitment, families will be given a self -addressed, stamped envelope to send the 
child’s [ADDRESS_574705] term (if available) , standardized test score report (if available),  and final report 
card to the research team. All report cards /score reports  will be returned to the family  via US 
Mail. Academic achievement, standardized test scores, and  school attendance will be recorded 
from the report cards.  All report cards in the DCPS system use the same grading scale. . 
 
The Self -Perception Profile  
The self -perception profile is a reliable validated 6 question questionnaire for children in grades 
6-8 that allows a child to self -evaluate their feelings about their engagement in school and their 
own school performance.  
5 
 
 
Reporting of the Quality of Lif e using the Peds QL 4.0 Form  
QOL will be measured using the  validated  PedsQL 4.0 for children, teens, and parents 
(Appendices B, C, D, and E).   The PedsQL 4.0 has four scales wi th 23 questions which 
ascertain physical functioning , emotional functioning , social functioning,  and school functioning .   
A 5-point Likert scale is used in the child self -report and for the parent proxy reports . Items are 
reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 
4=0), so hig her scor es indicate better QOL .  
 
E. Statistical analysis  Descriptive statistics will be  used to analyze demographic variable s 
(rates, proportions, means, medians, ranges). Univariate comparisons will be performed 
using appropriate categorical or continuous statistic al analyses. Multivariate testing will 
be performed using logistic and/or liner regression where appropriate.  
 
Sample Size: The study will be powered on the proportion of patients in each group with 
a grade point average >3.0. The overall proportion of DC public middle school students 
in the 2012 -2013 school year with a GPA >3.0 was approximately 35 %. Assuming that 
this figure is similar for children without as thma (controls), we will need [ADDRESS_574706] 80% power detect a 20 % absolute dif ference in the proportion of 
children with asthma (cases) with a grade point average >3.0 (alpha = 0.05, two -sided).  
 
We have chosen to include [ADDRESS_574707] that less than 50% of all included patients will return their final year report cards 
via the self -addressed, stamped envelope.  
 
F. Human Subjects  
A convenience sample of potential participants’ guardians will be approached in the 
temporal sequence that they are available either in the emergency depart ment or in the 
IMPACT DC Asthma Clinic, informed about the research study, and invited to participate.  
Informed consent will obtained from all guardians.  
 
After obtaining informed consent, trained research assistants and/or the investigators will 
use e xtant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_450753].  
 
1. The risks of this study include inadvertent disclosure of protected health 
information. This risk does not exceed the daily risk of inadvertent disclosure of 
patients’ protected health information during ED operations where patients’ 
records are accessed t hrough the ED tracking system of Logicare and the 
electronic medical records of EPRS.  
2. There is the risk of feeling uncomfortable during the questionnaires; families will 
be told that some of the questions may make them uncomfortable and they are 
welcome to  leave the study at any time, without penalty, if they feel 
uncomfortable. Alternatively, they may choose to leave questions unanswered.  
3. There are no direct benefits to study participants. However, the knowledge 
gained from this study may allow us to ident ify a cohort of patients at special 
risk, for whom a targeted intervention would be appropriate.  
6 
 
4. Therefore, the risks are reasonable in relation to the benefits.  
 
G. Risks and Side Effects  
Questionnaires  
Participants may find some of the questionnaires too personal ; they will be offered the 
opportunity to re fuse to an swer any questions that make them  feel uncomfortable.   
There is also the risk of breach of confidentiality; all participants will be assigned a 
random study number. This  study number will be us ed to identify all questionnaires. 
Coding for the study numbers will be secured on a password protected file on the PI’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -issued laptop and stored on the secure CNMC server.  We will store the study 
data in locked cabinets or offices .  
 
H. Benefits  
 
There are no direct benefits to participants.  
 
I. Outside Consultants/Collaborators   
 
 None.  
  
J. Contractual Agreements      
 
 None.  
 
K. Costs To Subjects:  
 
 There is no cost to subjects.   
 
L. Conflicts Of Interest:  
 
There are no conflicts o f interest.  
 
M. Confidentiality:  
The investigators will use reasonable measures to assure the security of these data, 
including locked office doors and file cabinets where paper records are stored, and secure, 
password -protected, computer software systems where electro nic data are stored.  The 
major risks to patients are the risks to confidentiality by [CONTACT_450769]. All paper data will be kept in the PI’s locked office in locked file cabinets, 
to which only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_450754]. All protected health information will be secured in 
password protected databases on the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_450755] 
(EMTC) drive. All research data will be de -identified and coded to further protect patient 
confidentiality. Code numbe rs and they respective medical record numbers will be kept in a 
separate password -protected database on the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s EMTC server. Passwords will only 
be known to the PI. These risks are reasonable in relation to the future anticipated benefits, 
which inc lude identifying a future cohort of patients who might benefit from targeted 
interventions. The risk of inadvertent disclosure of protected health information is no more 
than minimal and no more than encountered on any patient visit to the ED.  
  
 
[ADDRESS_574708] Compensation:  
 There will be no compensation for subjects on the expanded continuing portion of this study.  
O. Facilities and Equipment  
 Existing departmental facilities will be used.

1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This is a single  institution  phase  II trial designed  to assess  the therapeutic  activity  of CMVpp65  
specific  T-cells (CMVpp65 -CTL)  for the treatment  of CMV  infection  or persistent  CMV  viremia  after 
allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation.   T-cells for infusion  will be generated  from the 
seropositive  transplant  donor  by [CONTACT_761642] a pool of 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_761603]65.  
2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
Primary  Objectives:  
1. To assess in a single  arm Phase  II trial, the therapeutic  activity  of transplant  donor  derived  
CMVpp65 -CTL for the treatment  of clinically  overt  CMV  infection  or CMV  viremia  that is persistent  
despi[INVESTIGATOR_040]  2 weeks  of treatment  with antiviral  agents  such  as Ganciclovir  and /or foscarnet.  
2. Determine  the risk of inducing  GvHD  or increasing  its severity  by [CONTACT_761643]65 -CTL. 
Secondary  Objectives:  
 
1. Determine  the individual  efficacy  of transplant  donor  derived  CMVpp65 -CTLs  in decreasing  viral 
load by [CONTACT_761644].  
2. Examine  the dynamics  of in-vivo proliferation  and survival  of adoptively  transferred  donor  derived  
CMVpp65 -CTLs  by [CONTACT_761645].  
3. Determine  the degree  to which  treatment  with CMVpp65 -CTLs  can eliminate  or reduce  the exposure  
to antiviral  agents  such  as ganciclovir  and fosrcarnet  and thus reduce  the associated  morbidity  from 
organ  specific  toxicity  of antiviral  agents.  
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
Reactivation  of latent  cytomegalovirus  infections  remains  a major  cause  of morbidity  and mortality  
following  allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplants  (HSCT).   Although  prophylactic  or 
preemptive  treatment  with ganciclovir  or foscarnet  has reduced  the incidence  and mortality  of early 
CMV  infections  in HLA-matched  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (1,2 ), in 6-30% of cases,  treatment  may be hampered  or 
cannot  be sustained  due to complicating  myelosuppression  or nephrotoxicity  (3,4 ).  Prolonged  anti- 
viral treatment  may also delay  the recovery  of virus -specific  immune  responses,  leading  to a 
significant  incidence  of late onset  disease.   After 3 months  of treatment  with ganciclovir,  late CMV  
infection  was reported  by [CONTACT_761646]. in 17.8%  of 146 seropositive  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93013]-matched  
unmodified  marrow  transplants  (5,6).   These  late infections  were  lethal  in 46% of cases,  and were  
asscociated  with persistent  deficiencies  in absolute  numbers  of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and CMV - 
specific  T-cells (5,6).   In our own study  of 255 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93013]-matched  CD34+E- T-cell depleted  
HSCT  who did not receive  post transplant  immunosuppression,  the cumulative  incidence  of CMV  
reactivation  among  seropositive  patients  was similar  to that reported  following  unmodified  HSCT  
(58%  vs 40-60%),  and only 12% developed  clinically  overt  disease  (7).  Similar  to findings  reported

for unmodified  allo HSCTs,  deficiencies  of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were  significantly  associated  with 
disease  (6,7).  
CMV  infections  are particularly  dangerous  in seropositive  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761604]-identical  HSCT.  For 
example,  while  the overall  mortality  of CMV  infections  in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93013]-matched  HSCT  has been  
reduced  to 3-5%, (9,10)  mortality  rates  of 13-16% have been  reported  among  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93013]- 
haplotype  disparate  Tcell depleted  grafts  (11). Similarly,  for seropositive  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761605]ïve  cord blood  transplants,  the cumulative  incidence  of clinically  
significant  CMV  disease  has been  reported  to be as high as 29%,  with mortality  rates  of 6% to 9% 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_761606]  (12-14). 
 
Adoptive  Immunotherapy  for CMV  
Healthy  seropositive  individuals  contain  high frequencies  of CMV  and EBV-specific  CD4 [+] and CD8 
[+] T-cells,  ranging  from 0.4 - 3% of the total T-cell population,  that play a critical  role in controlling  in 
these  latent  viral infections  (8). The potential  of virus-specific  T-cells to control  CMV  and EBV 
infections  was initially  suggested  by [CONTACT_761647]-specific  CD8+  cytotoxic  T-cells and the potential  of allogeneic  HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761607]-induced  disease  (15-17). Subsequently,  we and others  have demonstrated  that adoptive  
transfer  of in vitro generated  transplant  donor -derived  virus specific  T-cells can clear  life-threatening  
clinical  CMV  infections  and induce  durable  remissions  of clonal  EBV-induced  lymphomas  emerging  
after allogeneic  HSCT  (18-30).  Our group  provided  the first demonstration  of the potential  of DLI to 
treat EBV lymphomas  in 1994  (25). Since  then,  we have been  conducting  a trial of transplant  donor  
derived  EBV-specific  T-cells in the treatment  of biopsy  proven  monoclonal  EBV lymphomas  post 
allogeneic  HSCT.  In our initial  experience,  three  weekly  infusions  of 106  EBVCTL/Kg  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761608] 13/19  (68%)  patients  treated  (22,23).  
 
Riddell  et al.(26)  were  the first to demonstrate  the feasibility  and clinical  efficacy  of CMV  specific  T- 
cells for the prophylaxis  and treatment  of CMV  reactivation  in post transplant  patients.  In this study,  
14 patients  with persistent  CMV  viremia  or those  at high risk were  treated  with 4 escalating  weekly  
doses  of CMV -specific  CD8+  T-cell clones  (107, 3x 107, 108  and 109/m2) using  donor  peripheral   
blood  mononuclear  cells (PBMC)  sensitized  with autologous  CMV  infected  fibroblasts.   All [ADDRESS_1042947]  treated  for persistent  CMV  viremia  
unresponsive  to antiviral  drugs  with infusion  of  5 x 105  – 1 x 106  CMV  specific  T-cells/kg   or 103- 104 
CMVpp65  responsive  IFNγ+   T-cells/kg  (21,27 -29).  Thus  studies  by [CONTACT_353375] (21), and Einsele  et 
al (27), used  1 x 105/kg (Peggs)  or 3.3 x 105/kg(Einsele ) CMV  specific  T-cells for treating  CMV  
viremia  or infections  in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761609] 19/24  
treated  patients,  with no grade  2 or greater  GvHD.   Micklethwaite  et al (28) prophylactically  infused  5 
x 105CMVpp65 -CTL/kg    for prevention  of CMV  infections  in [ADDRESS_1042948]  with only 4/12 patients  developi[INVESTIGATOR_761610]. Feuchtinger  et al (29) treated  [ADDRESS_1042949] from HLA–mismatched/  haploidentical  or HLA–matched  unrelated  donors   
with 2 x 104 IFNγ+   polyclonal  CMVpp65 -CTL /kg, 15/18  cleared  CMV  and there  was no reported

approach  employs  the isolation  of interferon -γ+  T-cells CliniMACS  using  IFNγ capture  microbeads  
(Miltenyi   Biotec)  (29). 
 
Our phase  I trial of transplant  donor -derived  CMVpp65  peptide  specific  T-cells (05-065) has 
completed  accrual  and required  follow  up and is being  readied  for publication.   Overall,  8/10 
evaluable  patients  that had failed  ganciclovir  and/or  foscarnet  durably,  cleared  CMV  viremia  after 
single  doses  of 0.5, 1 or 2 x 106 CMVpp65 -CTLs/kg;  all 46 patients  treated  with 3 weekly  doses  of 1 
x 106/kg CMVpp65  CTLs  cleared  CMV  viremia.   Elimination  of CMV  was consistently  correlated  with 
increments  in circulating  CMVpp65 -CTL of the same  epi[INVESTIGATOR_761611] Vβ usage  as the infused  
CMVpp65 -CTL. Detectable  numbers  of CMVpp65  CTLs  were  sustained  for 2-4 months.   Acute  
toxicities  were  rare, no patient  developed  de novo GvHD.  
We now propose  a single -armed  Phase  II trial to evaluate  transplant  donor  derived  derived  
CMVpp65CTL  in the treatment  of CMV  infections.  This study  will allow  us to evaluate  the ability  of 
this treatment  modality  to prevent  or limit the use of anti-viral drugs  with their associated  toxicities  in 
patients  treated  with donor  derived  CMVpp65  T-cells.  
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1042951] an 
active  CMV  infection  or persistent  CMV  viremia  for ≥ [ADDRESS_1042952] previously  provided  leukocytes  for 
generation  of CMVpp65 -CTL and for whom  such  CMVpp65 -CTL are available.  
CTLs  for infusion  will be generated  by [CONTACT_761648]  T-cells over 28 days 
using  autologous  dendritic  cells (DCs)  or EBV transformed  B cells loaded  with a pool of 138 
synthetic  peptides  spanning  the sequence  of CMVpp65.  (confer  section  5.[ADDRESS_1042953]  
Operating  Procedures).  
Concurrent  Therapy  : Antivirals  and Immunosuppression  
 
All patients  receiving  anti-viral drugs  may be maintained  at their current  doses  during  treatment  with 
CTLs.  Patients  can continue  treatment  with rapamycin  and calcineurin  inhibitors.   However,  steroid

IRB Number: 12 -086 A(23)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1042954]  be adjusted  so that:  Patients  are receiving  no more  than 0.3 mg/kg  of prednisone  or its 
equivalent.  
Characterization  and Monitoring   of CMV  Infections  and T-cell Responses:  
 
Prior to and at specific  intervals  following  infusion  of CMVpp65 -CTL, patients  wil be monitored  for : 
1) vital signs  and clinical  and radiologic  responses  at sites of CMV  infection,  2) level of circulating  
CMV  DNA by [CONTACT_954],  and levels  of CMVpp65 -CTL in the blood  as measured  by [CONTACT_761649],  CMVpp65 -specific  IFNγ+ T-cells (35 ), or epi[INVESTIGATOR_761612] -T-cells binding  
HLA-peptide  tetramers  (36).  The CMVpp65 -CTL infused  will also be characterized  as to TCR Vβ 
usage  and the sequence  of immunodominant  T-cells defined  so as to be able to track  disposition,  
and longevity  of these  T-cells post infusion.   Patients  will also be monitored  for any toxicities  as 
described  in section  11.0.  
4.3 Intervention  
 
The T-cells to be infused  will be selected  based  on criteria  mentioned  in section  4.0 from our bank of 
GMP  grade  CMVpp65 -CTL.  T-cells will be administered  by [CONTACT_761650].   In this  
phase  II trial, patients  will be treated  at doses  of 1 x 106 CMVpp65 -CTL/kg/dose/week  for 3 weeks.  
Patients  will be observed  for the following  3 weeks.   Additional  3 week  courses of CMVpp65 -CTL 
may be administered  if levels  of CMV  DNA in blood  are still detectable  despi[INVESTIGATOR_761613].  
The rationale  for the doses  of T-cells proposed  for treatment  stems  not only from our Phase  I trial  
but also from our own studies  of quantitating  doses  of unselected  T-cells required  to induce  GvHD  
and the doses  of EBV –CTLs  required  to induce  regressions  of EBV lymphomas  following  allogeneic  
HSCT.   Our studies  of the incidence  of GvHD  in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93059] T-cell depleted  matched  or [ADDRESS_1042955]  that  a dose  of ≥ 105 allo cytotoxic  T-cell (CTLp)/kg,  as quantitated  by 
[CONTACT_353387],  represents  the threshold  dose  for development  of grade  II or greater  GvHD  
(39).  In-vitro sensitization  of T-cells against  CMV  or EBV for a period  of [ADDRESS_1042956] 100 fold (34).  Therefore,  in the doses  of CMVpp65 -CTL proposed  for treatment  in this 
trial (1x 106/kg x 3 T-cells /kg), the doses  of potentially  alloreactive  T-cells administered  would  be 
estimated  to be below  the GvHD  threshold.   In practice,  the CMVpp65CTL  after this culture  period   
do not contain  detectable  allocytoxic  activity  against  patient  or fully allogeneic  PHA blasts.   Indeed,  
this lack of alloreactivity  is a release  criterion  that must  be met to use the cells for treatment.  
Our clinical  experience  also confirms  this. In our Phase  I trial of CMVpp65CTL,  no patient  developed  
GVHD.  Similarly,  none  of the 19 patients  with EBV lymphomas  in our study  developed  GvHD  when  
treated  with EBV specific  T-cells sensitized  for 4 weeks  with irradiated  autologous  EBV BLCLs  at 
doses  ranging  from 15-150 x 105 T-cells/kg  (21).  Rooney  et al (19 ), also observed  no cases  of 
GvHD  among  39 patients  treated  prophylactically  with transplant  donor  derived  EBV specific  T-cells 
generated  by a similar  technique  over a dose  range  of 3.3 – 33 x 105  T-cells /kg. 
Thus,  based  on our own experience,  as well as data from published  series,  the risk of GvHD  is 
expected  to be very low, and the doses  of infused  CMVpp65 -CTLs  will provide  enough  numbers  of 
CMV  reactive  T-cells to produce  effective  responses  against  CMV  infection.

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
 
5.1 Donors  of CMV -Specific  T-cells  
 
The CMV -specific  T-cell lines to be used  for treatment  in this protocol  and to be maintained  
cryopreserved  under  GMP  conditions  in the Adoptive  Immune  Cell Therapy  Facility  at MSKCC,  will 
be derived  fromthe  groups  listed  below:  
 
1. Normal,  HLA-typed,   CMV -seropositive  donors  of allogeneic  hematopoietic  progenitor  cell 
allografts,  who previously  consented  and gave blood  or leukocytes  to establish  CMV -specific  T- 
cells to be used  to treat a CMV  infection  were  it to develop  in the patient  to whom  they donated  a 
hematopoietic  cell graft.  Once  that patient  has reconstituted  immune  function  and is no longer  at 
risk for CMV,  the donors  will be asked  for consent,  in writing,  for the use of these  T-cells to treat 
CMV  in a patient  other  than the patient  for whom  they were  originally  intended.  
 
2. Normal,  HLA typed,  CMV -seropositive  related  and unrelated  hematopoietic  cell transplant  donors  
who consent  to provide  blood  or blood  white  cells to make  CMV -specific  T-cells for treatment  of 
CMV  in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761614] -specific  T cell line 
generated  can be used  for another  patient,  at such  time as the transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761615].  
 
3. Normal,  HLA typed,  CMV -seropositive  volunteer  blood  donors  whose  T cells may add to the HLA 
diversity  of the T cells available  in the Adoptive  Immune  Cell Therapy  Bank.  
 
Adequate  health  for donation  as determined  by [CONTACT_240825]  (related  donor)  or NMDP  (unrelated  
donor)  guidelines.   Normal  donors  will be evaluated  for evidence  of prior sensitization  to CMV  by

Clinical  studies  for donors  are obtained  within  [ADDRESS_1042958]  be within  a range  that would  not preclude  
donating  blood  or undergoing  leukapheresis.  Infectious  disease  markers  will be performed  as per 
each  department’s  guidelines  or at the discretion  of the treating  attending.  
For prospective  transplant  donors,  an informed  consent  will be obtained  and up to 2 blood  samples  
will be collected:  
 
i. An initial  donation  of 25 ml blood  (heparin  ACD)  to be used  for establishing  a B cell line 
transformed  with the B95.8  laboratory  strain  of EBV.   This EBV+  B cell line (EBV  BLCL)  will 
be used  as an antigen  presenting  cell for T-cell sensitization.   When  loaded  with the pool of 
CMVpp65  peptides,  the EBV BLCL  efficiently  sensitize  T-cells from the same  donors  against  
CMV  as well as EBV.  
 
The establishment  of the EBVBLCL  line requires  4-[ADDRESS_1042959] 2-3 months,  this blood  sample  should  be collected  prior to the donation  of the 
hematopoietic  progenitor  cell transplant  whenever  possible.

Generation  of  Antigen  Presenting  cells (Dendritic  cells and EBV BLCL  ) and Peptide  Loading  of 
APCs  
 
The DCs to be used  for T-cell sensitization  are generated  from PBMCs  isolated  from blood  
leucocytes  by [CONTACT_138789] -Hypaque  gradient  separation  and enriched  for monocytes  by [CONTACT_761655]14  clinical  grade  microbeads  
(miltenyi)  if the frozen/thawed  PBMC  is used.   The monocytes  are then re-suspended  at a 
concentration  of 1 x 106  cells/ml  in RPMI  supplemented  with 1% heat inactivated  autologous  serum  
(if available)  or prescreened  heat inactivated  human  AB serum  (Gemini)  clinical  grade  GMCSF  
(2000  IU/ml)  and interleukin -4 (1000  IU/ml).   The cultures  are be supplemented  with these  cytokines  
on days 2 and 4 in fresh  medium as  indicated  by [CONTACT_353390].   On days 5 or 6, 5 ng/ml  of TNFα , 2.5 
mg/ml  of IL-1β, 75 µg/ml of IL-6 and 0.5µg/ml PGE -2 are be added  for 48 hours  to induce  maturation  
of dendritic  cells.  Thereafter,  the dendritic  cells are be washed,  adjusted  to a concentration  of 1 x

peptides  (Invitrogen,  [LOCATION_011]  Massachussetts) in serum  free medium  at 37ºC  for 3 hours  and used  
for T-cell sensitization  as described  below.  
EBV transformed  B cells are be generated  as described  previously  (33 ), adjusted  to a concentration  
of 1 x 106/ml, and loaded  with 25µg CMVpp65  peptide  pool/ml  in serum free medium  at 37ºC  for 3 
hours  and used  for T-cell sensitization.  
 
Generation  of CMVpp65  Specific  T-cells 
 
T-cells will be generated  as described  in published  reports  and detailed  in the appendices  (34). 
Briefly,  CD3+  enriched  T-cell fractions  are initially  isolated  by [CONTACT_153531]-hypaque  gradient  separation  of 
peripheral  blood  leucocytes.   Thereafter,  monocytes  are depleted  by [CONTACT_761656]14  immunomagnetic  microbeads  
(Miltenyi  Biotechnology,  Gmbh,  Gladback,  [LOCATION_013])  if done  from frozen/thawed  PBMC.   The CD56+ 
NK+  cells and B cells are then removed  by [CONTACT_761657]56  and CD19  respectively  (CliniMACS  
CD56  reagent,  Miltenyi  Biotechnology,  Gmbh,  Gladback,  [LOCATION_013]).   Aliquots  of 1 x 106 T-cells /ml 
will then be stimulated  with 0.5 x 105/ml autologous  irradiated  monocyte - derived  DC or with EBV 
BLCL  previously  loaded  with a pool of 138 synthetic  overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_761617]65.   The stimulated  T-cells will then be cultured  in modified  Yssel’s medium  
supplemented  with 5% pre-screened  heat inactivated  human  AB serum  in sterile  flasks  at 37ºC,  with 
5% CO2 in air.  The culture  will be re-stimulated  with the peptide  loaded  DCs or EBV BLCL  at an 
effector  to target  ratio of 10:1 at 7 day intervals  for 21-28 days.   Clinical  grade  IL-2 (Chiron)  will be 
added  to a concentration  of 10-80 IU/ml  every  3 days,  beginning  on day 7 and IL-15 weekly  at the 
dose  of 10ng/ml  (stimulation  with DCs does not potentiate  significant  expansion  of T-cells.  The 
earlier  initiation  of cytokine  stimulation  at higher  doses  permits  generation  of higher  numbers  of T- 
cells to meet  the dose  requirements  in the protocol.   IL-15 has been  described  as a potent  stimulator  
of T-cell expansion  in-vitro. After 21-28 days in culture,  the T-cells will be harvested,  counted  and 
tested  for potency,  specificity  and lack of alloreactivity,  microbiological  sterility,  and for levels  of 
endotoxin  (confer  appended  Standard  operating  procedures).   If a sufficient  number  of T-cells is 
obtained,  the T-cells will then be aliquoted  into sterile  vials in calculated  doses  tested  as detailed  
below  and cryopreserved  for subsequent  administration  to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761618]’s  HSCT  or for a 
third party  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761619].   If additional  
numbers  of T-cells are required,  the pre-generated  CMVpp65 -CTLs  will be further  expanded  using  
OKT3,  IL2 and autologous  feeders  as described  in our currently  active  clinical  trial using  WT1  CTLs  
(IRB#07 -055) 
The dendritic  cells,  EBV BLCL  and T-cell lines will be generated  in the designated  Adoptive  Immune  
Cell Therapy  facility  of MSKCC  under  controlled  GMP  conditions.  
Characterization  of CMVpp65 -specific  T-cells 
 
Depending  on their growth,  T-cell cultures  will be evaluated  after 21-28 days of culture  for the 
proportion  of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and content  of CD3- CD56+  NK cells and CD20+  Cells.   They  
will also be evaluated  for their content  of CMVpp65  specific  IFNγ+   CD8+/CD4+ T-cells in response  to 
short   secondary  stimulation  with autologous  PBMC  loaded  with CMVpp65  peptide  pool.  Specificity

will also be ascertained  by [CONTACT_761658][INVESTIGATOR_761620],  as well as fully allogeneic  EBV BLCL.  
The matrix  of pentadecapeptide  subpools  approach  described  by [CONTACT_203623]  (34) will be used  to 
identify  specific  epi[INVESTIGATOR_761621]γ responses  with the CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells.   The T-cells will 
also be tested  for their capacity  to lyse both CMVpp65  peptide  loaded  targets  and CMV -infected  
donor  and patient  PHA blasts.   In addition,  a panel  of single  HLA matched  EBV BLCL,  both loaded  
and unloaded  with CMVpp65,    will be used  as targets  for in-vitro cytotoxicity  to determine  the HLA 
restriction  of the CMV  specific  T-cells generated  (34, 36).

responses  to unloaded  donor  and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761622].   Immediately  prior to cryopreservation,  T-cells will be tested  by [CONTACT_761659],  absence  of mycoplasma,  and absence  or acceptably  low levels  of 
endotoxin  (confer  appended  standard  operating  procedures).  T-cells will be considered  acceptable  
for administration  if: 
1. They  are microbiologuically  sterile,  free of mycoplasma  and contain  ≤ 5 EU of endotoxin/kg  
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22599]/dose/hour  infusion  of T-cell culture  
2. The T-cells can specifically  lyse CMV -peptide  loaded  donor  and /or host APCs.  
3. The T-cells do not lyse unmodified  PHA blasts  of the transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761623], if not evaluable,  
PHA blasts  from a fully allogeneic  blood  donor  above  levels  of cytotoxicity  detected  against  
autologous  PHA blasts.  
4. Whenever  possible,  aliquots  of these  T-cells will be saved  to determine  the T-cell receptor  
Vβ repertoire  of T-cells reactive  against  specific  epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].  
Unused  T-cells will be maintained  cryopreserved  under  GMP  conditions  in the Adoptive  Immune  Cell 
Therapy  facility  at MSKCC  after the patient’s  transplant,  after which  they will be used  (i) as 3rd party  
CMV  or EBV specific T-cells if consented  to by [CONTACT_183947],  for the treatment  of other  patients  such  as

supervision  of the allogeneic  marrow  transplant  services  in Medicine  and Pediatrics.  
Prior to receiving  treatment,  some  patients  may undergo  diagnostic  and/or  other  testing  of their 
tissue,  if available,  to determine  if their CMV  infected  cells are likely to respond  to treatment  with 
CMV  specific  T cells.  Alternatively,   blood  samples  may be required  for research  tests  to ascertain  
that the CMV -specific  T-cells do not contain  any cells that could  react  against  the patient.  These  
patients  will sign a separate  pre-treatment  consent.  
Eligible  patients  will be interviewed  prior to enrollment  on this study,  to explain  the purpose  and the 
involved  treatments  and procedures.   The risks and benefits  of participating  in the trial and 
receiving  CMVpp65 -CTL infusions  will be presented  and discussed.  These  explanatory

7.1.2a  Donors  in Group  1 (Historical  Donors)  
 
Because  historical  donors  were  only under  the care of MSKCC  for the period  in which  they 
donated  cells for their primary  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761626],  they will be mailed  a copy 
of the consent  form to review  during  the consent  discussion,  which  will occur  over the phone.  If 
they agree  to 3rd party  use of their cells,  the consent  will be signed  and sent back via MSKCC  
provided  pre-paid/addressed  envelope.  
 
The registration  process  is outline  in section  15.1.  
 
7.1.2b  Donors  in Groups  2 & 3 (Prospective  and Volunteer  Donors)  
 
A similar  but separate  discussion  that occurs  with patients  will also take place  with the prospective  
donors  of the T-cells,  defining  the risks of blood  and/or  white  cell donations  required  for the 
generation  of the T-cells to be used  for adoptive  immunotherapy,  and the clinical  indications  for 
which  the T-cells will be used.   Following  this discussion,  the donor  will be asked  to sign a written  
consent  to donate  the blood  cells to be used  to generate  CMVpp65 -CTLs  for adoptive  
immunotherapy.  
7.2 Inclusion  of Women  and Minorities  
 
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  has filed form HHS 441 (re: Civil Rights),  form HHS 641 
(handicapped  individuals),  and form 639-A (re: Sex Discrimination).   In selecting  patients  for study  
in the projects  proposed  in this protocol,  we have taken  due notice  of NIH/ADAMHA   policies  
concerning  inclusion  of women  and minorities  in clinical  research  populations.   We expect  that the 
study  population  will be fully representative  of the range  of patients  seen  at Memorial  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_761627], gender,  or ethnic  background.   Based  on a January  1, 2001 - 
December  2005  analysis  of patient  populations  on allogeneic  transplant  protocols  at this Center,  
the racial  distributions  were  24% African  American,  Hispanic  or Asian,  and 76% Caucasian.  The 
gender  distribution  was 41% female  and 59% male.  The protocol  is open  to all patients   
irrespective  of gender  or ethnic  background.  The population  of patients  transplanted  reflects  the 
distribution  of the patients  in our tri-state  referral  area.  However,  it is anticipated  that the 
distribution  of patients  by [CONTACT_761662],  but that a higher  proportion  of individuals  from minority  racial  groups  will be 
accrued  to the cord blood  transplant  protocols,  both because  of the greater  HLA disparity  
permissible  and the concerted  efforts  of these  banks  to obtain  donor  units from populations  
underrepresented  in the NMDP.   Given  the highly  specific  patient  population  that is subject/eligible  
for this treatment,  the trial will be registered  under  clinical  trials.gov  to enable  other  transplant  
centers  to review  and refer patients  for treatment.   No other  specific  outreach  efforts  are planned  
for accrual.  
 
Pregnant  women  are excluded  from this study.   There  are no age restrictions  for this study,  and 
eligible  children  will be enrolled  if appropriate  consents  are obtained  from parents  and /or 
guardians.

Prior to T cell infusion,  eligible  and consenting  patients  will be clinically  assessed  for their general  
condition  and for extent  of CMV  infection.  Tests/exams  will be obtained  within  3 days of infusion  
(whenever  possible).  Certain  tests  may be omitted  at the discretion  of the treating  physician:  
 
 
• Clinical  history  and Physical  examination  
• Chest  x-ray (not necessary  if CT scan  is done)  
• CT scan  is not required  prior to treatment,  but should  be done,  whenever  possible,  within  3 
days of T cell infusion  
• Ophthalmologic  exam  for CMV  retinitis,  if clinically  indicated  
• Colonoscopy  for CMV  colitis,  if clinically  indicated  
• ECHO  and/or  EKG,  if clinically  indicated  
• CBC  with differential  
• Comprehensive  Panel  
• Cultures  of affected  body fluids  or tissues  will be obtained  whenever  possible  
• CMV  viremia  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_761663]+  blood  leukocytes  and by 
[CONTACT_761664].  
• Lymphocyte  immunophenotype  (BMT  short  panel)  and T cell responses  to PHA and Candida  
Albicans  
 
In addition,  T cell responses  to CMV  will be evaluated  in Dr. O’Reilly’s  laboratory  by: 
• Assessment  of T cell proliferation  in response  to CMV  antigens  and 
• Quantitation  of T cells generating  IFNγ in response  to stimulation  with a pool of CMV  
pentadecapeptides   and 
• In patients  expressing  HLA-A0201,  B0701  or B0801  T cells binding  CMV  peptide  – HLA A2, 
B7 or A24 tetramers  
• Analysis  of TCR Vβ repertoire  will also be performed  
 
 
9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
This is a single  institution   phase  II trial designed  to assess  the therapeutic  activity  of primary  
donor  derived  CMVpp65  specific  T-cells (CMVpp65 -CTL)  for the treatment  of CMV  infection  or 
persistent  CMV  viremia  after allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation.   The T-cells will 
be generated  from healthy,  CMV  seropositive  donors  by [CONTACT_761665],  
cytokine -activated   monocytes  loaded   with a pool of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_761628]65.  
9.[ADDRESS_1042970]  is cryopreserved  in a volume  of 1-2 ml. This will be drawn  up in a sterile  
syringe  containing  30 ml of normosol  for intravenous  administration  and administered  by [CONTACT_761666]  5 minutes.  
 
In this phase  II trial, patients  will be treated  at doses of 1 x 106  CMVpp65 -CTL/kg/dose/week  for 3 
weeks  (+/- 20% variability  of total dose).  Patients  will be observed  for the following  3 weeks.  
Additional  3 week  courses of CMVpp65 -CTL may be administered  if levels  of CMV  DNA in blood  are 
still detectable  despi[INVESTIGATOR_761629].

given  to ensure  that the total combined  volume  of the [ADDRESS_1042972] previously  provided  
leucocytes  for generation  of CMVpp65 -CTL and for whom  such  CMVpp65 -CTL are available.  
9.3 Selection  of CMVpp65 -CTL 
 
Patients  will be treated  with CMVpp65 -CTL generated  from their transplant  donor.  
 
10.0 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
The timing  of evaluations  below  is approximate.  The schedule  of tests  described  should  be adhered  
to whenever  possible.  However,  in certain  situations,  particularly  late after treatment,  circumstances  
may preclude  assessments  at the times  specified,  at which  point they may be held the discretion  of 
the treating  physician:  
 
• Patients  will be evaluated  clinically  by [CONTACT_761667]-infusion,  post,  and at approximately  1, 
2, 3, and 4 following  initiation  of each  infusion  of CMV -specific  T-cells 
 
• The patient  should  be followed  weekly  for the first [ADDRESS_1042973] initial  infusion.  Patients  will receive  interim  
history,  review  of systems,  and physical  exam  (including  GvHD  evaluations)  on the day of 
infusions,  and on days 1, 8 and 15 whenever  possible.  
 
• Patients  should  be monitored  by [CONTACT_761668] [ADDRESS_1042974] initial  infusion.  
 
• Tests quantitating  CMV  viremia  by [CONTACT_761669][INVESTIGATOR_761630] [ADDRESS_1042975] initial  infusion  
 
• Quantifications  of T cells generating  IFNγ in response  to pooled  CMV  pentadecapeptides  or 
T cells specific  for single  pentadecapeptides  known  to be contained  in the T cells infused  
should  be measured  weekly  for the first [ADDRESS_1042976] initial  infusion.  If the T cells infused  are known  to 
contain  T cells that can bind specific  CMV  peptide/HLA  tetramers,  these  T cells will also be 
quantitated.

• When  possible,  pre-initial  infusion  and at week  [ADDRESS_1042978] initial  infusion,  if >1% of 
the circulating  T cells are found  to be reactive  against  specific  epi[INVESTIGATOR_761631],  
these  CMV -pp65 -reactive  T cells will, if possible,  be characterized  as to their T cell receptor  
Vβ repertoires,  to determine  whether and to what degree,  the T cells expanding  in vivo 
resemble  (and,  therefore,  are likely to be derived  from)  the CMV -specific  T cells infused  at 
the time of adoptive  transfer  
 
• If there  are clinical  indications,  research  samples  may be collected  testing  for cytokines.  
 
• Flow Cytometry  [ADDRESS_1042979] initial  infusion

be obtained  pre-initial  infusion  and may also be monitored  at approximately  2, 4, and [ADDRESS_1042980] initial  infusion  as a measure  of general  immune  function.  
 
• Patients  with CMV  pneumonia  should  be monitored  by [CONTACT_761670]/or  O2 saturations  until normalized  and weekly  chest  films together  with CT scans  
at pre-infusion  and approximately  every  2-4 weeks  until clear.  
 
• Ophthalmologic  evaluations  will be made  to document  responses  of CMV  retinitis.   These  
evaluations  will ideally  be done  every  2 weeks.  
 
• Patients  with known  CMV  enteritis  should  be monitored  by [CONTACT_761671] 24 hour stool volumes,  stool guaiacs  and cultures  for CMV.   If acceptable  
to the patient,  colonoscopy  should  be repeated  approximately  three  weeks  after the dose  of 
T cells to assess  response.  
 
• If the CMV  infection  affects  the CNS,  lung, or abdominal  organs,  and virus has been  
detected  (e.g.:  in pleural  or peritoneal  fluids),  appropriate  tissue  and/or  CSF may be collected  
(if indicated  and possible)  and tested  for the presence  of CMV  and CMV  specific T-cells.  
These  tests  should  occur  between  3-[ADDRESS_1042981] initiation  of treatment,  whenever  possible.

11.0   TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
In this study,  we will be capturing  and tracking  Grade  3-[ADDRESS_1042983]-infusion.  Patients  who 
might  subsequently  receive  donor  lymphocytes,  boosts,  or a secondary  transplant  will be evaluable  
up until that time point.  Toxicities  which  are attributable  to underlying  malignancy  and/or  were  present  
prior to initiation  of therapy  will not be tracked.  Please  see section  17.2 for Serious  Adverse  Event  
reporting.  
 
1. Acute  T oxicities  and Transfusion  Reactions.  The infusion  of CMV -peptide  specific  T-cells 
might  cause  an acute  transfusion  reaction  or an allergic  reaction  to the cell infusion  manifested  by [CONTACT_761674]:  fever,  shaking  chills,  difficulty  breathing,  a drop 
in the blood  pressure,  skin rash or swelling  of the mucus  membranes  in the mouth  or vaginal  tract,  or 
impairment  of kidney  function.  Based  on prior experience  with infusions  of T-cells at our own and other  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 12 -086 A(23)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1042984]-2019  
Page  19 of 30  
  
 
 
institutions,  the risk of such  immediate  toxicities  is anticipated  to be small.  However,  each  patient  will 
be closely  monitored  for vital signs  and clinical  symptoms  prior to and following  T-cell infusion.  
Reactions  will be treated  as clinically  indicated.  
2. Specific  Immune   Reactions.   The CMV  peptide -specific  T-cells are expected  to migrate  to 
sites where  CMV  infected  cells are concentrated,  and to begin  to kill these  CMV  infected  cell 
populations.  These  cells may be concentrated  in the lung, liver, retina/central  nervous  system,  or 
intestinal  tract.  While  it is expected  that the small  doses  of T-cells administered  will take time to 
replicate,  and will exert  their antiviral  effects  over a time period  of days to weeks,  it is possible  that 
these  cells could  concentrate  in an infected  tissue  and cause  more  severe  inflammation  as they attack  
virus infected  cells.  This could  transiently  increase  the severity  of a pneumonia  or a CMV  –induced  
encephalitis,  retinitis,  hepatitis  or intestinal  infection,  and could  even be life-threatening.  Additionally,  
patients  with pre-existing  pulmonary  conditions  maybe  at increased  risk for development  of pulmonary  
toxicity  including  diffuse  alveolar  hemorrhage.  For patients  treated  for drug resistant  CMV -retinitis  , 
these  T cells could  potentially  cause  partial  or complete  blindness.  If this were  the case,  
immunosuppressive  drugs  might  be required  to halt such  a reaction,  and eliminate  the T-cells.  Were  
this required,  the antiviral  activity  of the T-cells would  be removed  and the infection  could  progress  in 
the absence  of any specific  resistance.  
3. Graft  versus  Host  Disease.  The CMV  peptide -specific  T-cells have been  cultured  for over [ADDRESS_1042985] Disease  (GvHD).This  immune  reaction  against  the 
host can cause  skin rash,  hepatitis,  and enteritis.  In its most  severe  form,  it can be fatal. Were  
moderate  to severe  GvHD  (Grade  2-4) to develop,  the patient  will be treated  with high doses  of 
glucocorticosteroids.  Additional  immunosuppressive  agents  may be used  if the GvHD  does not 
respond  to steroid  treatment.  
4. Infection.  There  is a potential  that transfusions  of white  cells or T-lymphocytes  may also serve  
as vectors  of serious  infection.  All precautions  to maintain  sterility  will be taken.  
5. Autoimmune  Hemolytic Anemia. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been reported in 2 
out of 75 (2.6%)  patients  treated  with CMV  peptide -specific  T-cells in prior phase  [ADDRESS_1042986].  
Discussion  with the medical  monitor  is encouraged.  
 
 
11.1 Donor  Toxicity/Side  Effects  
 
Risks  of blood  donation  are minimal  and include:  minor  discomfort  at site of blood  draw,  some  
bleeding  and/or  bruising,  and lightheadedness.  
Risks  of Leukapheresis  include:  The agent  used  to prevent  clotting  of blood  during  a leukapheresis  
may cause  low levels  of calcium in the blood  and result  in the lack of feeling  or tingling  of fingertips  
or around  mouth,  which  normally  last only a short  time,  and can, potentially,  progress  to cramps.  
This is normally  treated  with a calcium  supplement.  
 
Other  leukapheresis  side effects  include:  
- Pain

- Bruising  at the needle  insertion  sites 
- Dizziness  
- Nausea  
- Fainting  due to temporary  lowering  of the blood  pressure  (rare)  
- Infection  (rare)  
 
Platelet  count  may drop during  the leukapheresis  and will be measured  after the collection.  If platelet  
count  falls enough  to place  the donor  in danger  of bleeding,  count  will be checked  daily until it 
returns  to normal.  
 
The leukapheresis  requires  that a needle  be placed  in a vein in each  arm. About  15% of the time,  we 
are unable  to use the donor’s  arm veins.  The donor  may be asked  to go through  a minor  surgical  
procedure  to place  a central  line. The donor  will be asked  to sign another  consent  form if a central 
line needs  to be put in. 
 
12.0   CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
The primary  endpoint  of this study  is to assess  whether  the infusion  of the CMVpp65 -CTLs  has 
therapeutic  activity  in curing  CMV  infections  in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_761633].  This study  specifically  will evaluate  
the therapeutic  efficacy  and persistence  after infusion  of CMVpp65 -CTLs  derived  from the HSCT  
transplant  donor  for the treatment  of CMV  infections.  The second  clinical  end point of this study  is the 
evaluation  of GvHD  induction  after infusion  of donor  derived  CMVpp65 -CTLs.   . 
 
The responses  of CMV  infections  will be clinically  monitored  as detailed  under  section  10. Responses  
to adoptively  transferred  T-cells are usually  not observed  until the T-cells have had time to expand  
within  the transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841],  a period  of at least [ADDRESS_1042988] resolved  
and/or  the patient  no longer  has detectable  CMV  DNA by [CONTACT_954].  
 
A partial  response  will be defined  as a 2xLog 10 reduction  in the level of CMV  DNA detected  in the 
patients  blood  and/or  improvement  in clinical  parameters  of CMV  infection  such  that the patient  is 
symptom -free. 
 
Stable  disease  will be defined  as no change  in the clinic  severity  of disease  in any organ.  
 
Progressive  disease  will be defined  as disease  progression  by [CONTACT_761675],  
ascribable  to CMV  infection  in any affected  organ,  with unchanged  or increased  levels  of CMV  DNA.  
 
Graft  versus  Host Disease  initially  developi[INVESTIGATOR_761634] [ADDRESS_1042989]  criteria  of the IBMTR/NMDP  Consensus  Panel.  Whenever,  
possible,  the diagnosis  will be confirmed  by [CONTACT_761676],  using  the 
pathological  criteria  of Woodruff  et al.  Patients  with preexisting  GvHD  of grade  1 severity  not requiring

13.0     CRITERIAFOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
In accordance  with the Declaration   of Helsinki,   ICH Good  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines,   and the 
US FDA Regulations,   a patient  has the right to withdraw  from the study  at any time for any 
reason  without  prejudice   to his/her  future  medical  care by [CONTACT_353409].   The 
Investigator   also has the right to withdraw  patients   from the study  (see below).  Should  a patient  
(or a patient’s   legally   authorized   representative)   decide  to withdraw,  all efforts  will be made  to 
complete  and report  the observations   as thoroughly   as possible.  
 
A complete  final evaluation  should  be made  at the time of the patient’s  withdrawal,  the Study  Status  
Outcome  form in the case report  form should  be completed  with an explanation  of why the patient  is 
withdrawing,  and an attempt  should  be made  to perform  a follow -up evaluation.  
 
Patients  may be removed  from study  if one or more  of the following  events  occur:  
• Significant  noncompliance  on the part of the patient  
• Refusal  of the patient  to continue  treatment  or observations  
• Unacceptable  toxicity  (i.e.: grade  3-4 toxicity  related  to CMV  CTL infusion).  Removal  for unacceptable  
toxicity  does not necessarily  preclude  continued  follow -up. 
• Progressive  disease  that in the Investigator’s   opi[INVESTIGATOR_761635]  
• Decision  by [CONTACT_127145]’s  best medical  interest  
• Unrelated  medical  illness  or complication  
• Lost to follow -up.

related  Clinical  Research  Policy  and Procedure  #401  (Protocol  Participant  Registration).  
15.3 Randomization  
 
There  is no randomization  in this study.  
 
16.1 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
This is a single  institution  trial and all patients  will be treated  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  
Center.  
 
A Clinical  Research  Coordinator  (CRC)  will be assigned  to this study.  The responsibilities  of the 
CRC  include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  
monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinate  the activities  of the protocol  study  
team.  The data manager  will also monitor  laboratory  compliance  through  out the study.  Laboratory  
data will be tabulated  and summarized  based  on MSKCC  normal  ranges.  
 
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into the MSKCC  Clinical  Research  Data Base  
(CRDB).  
 
16.[ADDRESS_1042998]  align with the MSK DSM Plan,  
where  applicable.  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  were  approved  by [CONTACT_353411]  2018.  The plans  address  the new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_633147]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of 
Clinical  Trials.”  
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_84854],  safety  and 
quality.  At a departmental/PI  [INVESTIGATOR_761636](s).  Institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  include  protocol  monitoring,

compliance  and data verification  audits,  staff education  on clinical  research  QA and two institutional  
committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.  The 
committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the 
Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the Deputy  
Physician -in-Chief,  Clinical  Research.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its level of 
risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  
 
The MSK DSMB  monitors  phase  III trials and the DSMC  monitors  non-phase  III trials.   The DSMB/C  
have oversight  over the following  trials:  
 
• MSK Investigator  Initiated  Trials  (IITs;  MSK as sponsor)  
• External  studies  where  MSK is the data coordinating  center  
• Low risk studies  identified  as requiring  DSMB/C  review  
 
The DSMC  will initiate  review  following  the enrollment  of the first participant/or  by [CONTACT_761678].  The DSMB  will initiate  review  once  the protocol  is 
open  to accrual.  
 
 
 
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
17.2 Privacy

17.2.2  Definition  of SAE 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or participant  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  starts  investigational  
treatment/intervention.   SAE reporting  is required  for 30-days after the participant’s  last 
investigational  treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occur  after the 30-day period  that is 
unexpected  and at least possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
 
Please  note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention  
and is related  to a screening  test or procedure  (i.e., a screening  biopsy)  must  be reported.  
 
The SAE report  should  be completed  as per above  instructions.   If appropriate,  the report  will 
be forwarded  to the FDA by [CONTACT_761679]: 12 -086 A(23)

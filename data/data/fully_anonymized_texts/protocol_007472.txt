Accessible Chiropractic Care and an Integrated Multidisciplinary Chronic Pain Team: 
Observational Study of Strategies to Manage  Chronic Spi[INVESTIGATOR_83205] a Federally Qualified  Health Center  
 
Date: July 1, [ADDRESS_90729] common complaints encountered in the U nited States 
health system (16 -18). One multi -center  study determined that 31% of primary care visits in 
community settings involved chronic  lower back or neck  pain ( 18). Furthermore, t he annual 
prevalence of nonspecific neck pain in a Canadian study was estimated to be between 30 and 
50% (26) ; the global point prevalence of low back pain (LBP)  is estimated at around 9% , with an 
estimat ed 80% lifetime prevalence (9, 10 ). Ou t of all [ADDRESS_90730] in terms of disability (years lived with 
disability), and sixth in terms of disability adjusted life -years (DALYs)  (9). In addition to the 
effect on patients, LB P costs the medical system an estimated $[ADDRESS_90731] (6,7 ).  
The treatment of chronic spi[INVESTIGATOR_83206] a stepwise approach that includes non -
steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), rest, exercise, physical therapy, a nd sometimes 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] s (11, 26). Unfortunately, opi[INVESTIGATOR_83207] -
term efficacy in managing chronic pain, at the cost of numerous adverse effects, i ncluding 
addiction and overdose  (3). Now at the forefront of public health challenges, o pi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related 
deaths have quadrup led from 1999 -2015, with 33,091 deaths attributed to opi[INVESTIGATOR_83208] 
2015 (11,  12).  
As a response , there have been multiple efforts to study the effects of non-pharmacologic 
treatments  for chronic spi[INVESTIGATOR_18172]. Patients seeking these modalities have been shown to have 
higher satisfaction with their management and lower costs to the health system (14, -16, 19). 
Chiropractic physicians manage patients with chronic spi[INVESTIGATOR_83209] -pharmacologic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], namely spi[INVESTIGATOR_83210], work/activity modification, and exercise 
and lifestyle advice . Chiropractic care is a clinically -proven safe and effective strategy for 
managing spi[INVESTIGATOR_83211]  (16, 20, 21, 24). In a recent systematic review, chiropractic care was 
equally effective as ph ysical therapy,  but there is only limited evidence of equali ty with medical 
care (23 ).  
Low-income patients might be  underrepresented in chiropractic clinics . Although there have 
been numerous cited attempts to include underserved patients in chiropractic care, there are  few 
studies reporting efficacy of such programs. One Canadian study demonstrated that an urban 
chiropractic clinic could achieve sustainability and effectively reduce spi[INVESTIGATOR_18172] ( 25). 
Furthermore, on -site chiropractic care in the workplace has been proven to reduce overall 
healthcare utilization, including emergency department visits, outpatient visits, and radiologic 
images ( 13). Although no such study known to these authors has been p ublished integrating 
chiropractic care within a federally qualified health center  (FQHC) , it can be hypothesized that 
this model would improve patient outcomes and satisfaction, while reducing healthcare costs and 
potentially reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155].  
Affinia Healthcare is a multi -site FQHC in St. Louis, Missouri serving more than 40 ,000 patients 
per year. Recently, this organization has developed two unique strategies to manage  chronic 
pain: 1) a multidisciplinary  pain team and 2) chiropractic care. In 2016, Logan University 
College of Chiropractic began partnering with FQHCs, including Affinia Healthcare, whereby 
[CONTACT_83229]. Using a flat rate of $[ADDRESS_90732] endorsed this model for its acceptability, affordability, and feasibility 
among the  primary care team members (1,2,4,5 ). These have focused on qualitative outcomes, 
and did not focus on endpoints of opi[INVESTIGATOR_83212]. In 
order to assess the effectiveness  of the integrated pain team , this study will investigate pain and 
disability score reductions and opi[INVESTIGATOR_83213].  
In order to best assess both pain and functional status, this  study will use the Pain Disability 
Questionnaire (PDQ) as its validated quantitative assessment tool. As opposed to traditional pain 
scales, it incorporates both psychosocial and functional status com ponents; because of this it is a 
useful survey to asses s the impact of interventions to reduce  pain and improve function , 
including chronic spi[INVESTIGATOR_18172] (27, 28).

reducing chronic pain and decreasing opi[INVESTIGATOR_83223] a FQHC . 
Primary Objectives:  
i. Determine the PDQ score  change over time with either intervention  
ii. Determine the proportion of patients who successfully wean off prescription 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_83224]:  
i. Identify clinical and demographic factors associated with treatment success  
ii. Identify patients who can successfully red uce their morphine equivalent dose if 
not able to fully wean from opi[INVESTIGATOR_83225]. Determine the proportion of eligible patients that adhere to the recommended 
treatments (by [CONTACT_83230])  
 
2. Methods  
a. Design: This study will be a prospective observational st udy. There will be no 
randomization. Patients and their primary care p rovider  (PCP)  will determine 
their health plans outside of the influence of this proposed study. Once 
determined by [CONTACT_83231] (chiropractic care or interdisciplinary pain team), they will be 
scheduled an appropriate appointment. On the day of their appointment, all 
patients will be reviewed by [CONTACT_83232]. If eligible, they 
will be offered the consent document to enroll in the study.  The clinician will then 
be blinded to which patients have consented to participation so as to minimize 
bias. Patients concurrently enrolled in both intervention groups will be included in 
a final sub group analysis.  
 
b. Control group: For this proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], there will be no control group. 
Ideally, a standard care group could be analyzed, but currently, Affinia does not 
have the administrative or IT support to incorporate the PDQ in its workflow or  
medical records. Future studies could be designed and planned with this in mind if 
the initial studies have impactful results.  
 
c. Inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Inclusion criteria:  Individuals with chronic (>90 days) spi[INVESTIGATOR_83226].  
Exclusion criteria:  Patients deemed to have non -mechanical spi[INVESTIGATOR_83227], compression fracture, or inflammatory spondylo arthropathy.   
d. The target number of enrolled patients per treatment is 30. Thus approximately 60 
patients will be enrolled.  Enrollment period is estimated to be three months, and 
will end when the targe t participant number  is achieved. Patients will be followed 
a total of 6 months. Data analysis may take an additional 3 months. Thus this study 
will take approximately 12 months.  
 
e. Data will be stored both electronically and paper -format. A hardcopy of t he Patient 
Disability Questionnaire (PDQ) will be provided. This hardcopy will be used to 
help guide clinical decisions during the visit, and then scanned into the electronic 
health record (EHR). Medications, including opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155] , will be recorded 
in the EHR. A list o f enrolled patients will be kept in Microsoft Excel.  
 
f. Enrolled participants will be tracked in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to be stored 
in Affinia Healthcare’s user -specific and password -protected desktop computers  
with drive encryption . In order to trac k opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155], the enrolled patient list 
can be exported to Affinia’s IT department to run a medication search. This 
information will be relayed to the study team to enter in the database. Any 
discrepancies, suspected to be minimal, will require a  manual chart review. This 
will be done by [CONTACT_83233]. Prior to final data analysis, data will be de -identified. All data 
transactions will be done through secure, encrypted serve r e-mail.  
 
g. Will the data set include any sensitive information (e.g., HIV status, psychiatric 
diagnosis)? No.  
 
h. Will the data set include any genomic data?  No. 
 
i. Will your data be used in collaborative efforts with other institutions? Yes. Patrick 
Battaglia , DC, DACBR and  Barry Wiese, DC, MHA, DIBCN, will be co -
investigator from Logan University . The faculty of Logan University who have 
patient privileges at Affinia Healthcare have access to the same EHR  and servers, 
and data will remain in the same secure, encrypted locations.  
 
3. Study Statistics  
Primary outcome variable:  
i. Difference in PDQ (functional and psychosocial scores ) 
ii. Proportion of patients weaned from opi[INVESTIGATOR_83228]:  
i. Odds of treatment success  by [CONTACT_83234] (age, sex, origin,  other 
musculoskeletal pain diagnoses,  etc.) 
ii. Proportion of patients successfully  reduced  on morphine equivalent dose  (any 
reduction)  
iii. Proportion of eligible patients who adhere to treatment (show rates)  
 
Analysis plan (sample size justification and interim analysis)  
Sample size calculations will be technically challenging due to the observational 
nature of the dual -intervention study design. We will estimate that standard care 
results in 90% failure rate to positiv ely change PDQ scores or wean opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. We 
will estimate the true relative risk of treatment failure is 0.5. Using the null 
hypothesis that there is no difference between the treatments and that there is no 
difference between either treatment and standard c are, our calculations predict that  
16 experimental subjects will be needed per intervention. The proportion of cross -
over patients is unknown, so a conservative 50% will be used, and thus 32 (30 for 
ease of estimation) patients will be needed per group to reject the null ( α=0.05 , 
power=0.8). We will use the chi-squared statistic to evaluate this null hypothesis. 
Two-sample t -test and multiple  linear regression will be conducted to determine the 
demographic and clinical features associated with outcomes . Most demographic 
factors will be binary or categorical, including age.  
Variables to collect  
i. Age (categorical)  
ii. Sex 
iii. Preferred language  
iv. Country of origin  
v. Insurance (categorical)  
vi. Type of spi[INVESTIGATOR_18172] (cervical, lumbar)  
vii. Morphine equivalent dose  
viii. Other musculoskeletal pain diagnoses (hip pain, shoulder pain, etc.)  
 
 
4. Risks  
a. Address the risk of loss of confidentiality.  
b. Discuss the steps you are taking to minimize this risk.  
c. Discuss your plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations  
 
There ar e no anticipated medical, legal, or financial risks to the participants.  
There is no randomization and no placebo. Patients will be studied as part of a treatment 
plan dictated independently by [CONTACT_83235]. Risks to confidentiality will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_83236]: study records will be accessible only to 
authorized study staff, and the generated data report for analysis will be de -identified.  
Chart reviews will be conducted for enrolled study participants, gathering pre -selected 
variables.  
This study relies upon a steady referral stream to Affinia chiropractic care and the 
pain team. Currently, these are accessible and well -utilized services, but there is no way 
to predict the future trend of these referrals . Any unanticipated change in providers, 
access to the pain team  or chiropractic services , or patients refusing participation will 
extend the enrollment period.

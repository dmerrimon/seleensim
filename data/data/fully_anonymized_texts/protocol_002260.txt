Revise d 9/2/14 Brief Summary of Research (250-400 words): 
Patients who receive autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the treatment of 
Multiple Myeloma (MM) are typi[INVESTIGATOR_135606] 14-[ADDRESS_1134124] in the treatment of MM will be recruited in the weeks to 
months prior to their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Light therapy incorporating ambient systematic programmed light 
illumination (sPI) will be used in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60916] (during scheduled transplant) to control cancer-
related fatigue (CRF) . The FDA has certified that light therapy, like that used in this study, is a low-risk 
intervention. After initial assessment of CRF, depression, and sleep quality/quantity (baseline 
assessments), participants will be randomized to one of two treatment conditions : one with an active 
intervention, and one with a non-active comparison . During inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the active 
intervention will consist of the following regimen: high intensity bright-white light (1300 lux at the eyes ) 
during morning hours (7AM to 10AM) . The non-active comparison condition will receive half the intensity 
dim-white light of  the active group (i.e., 90 lux at the eyes ) during 7AM-10AM. These differences in lux 
intensity are not easily discernable. Following baseline, assessment of fatigue, sleep activity, depression, 
circadian rhythms, and quality of life will continue through the course of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (14-[ADDRESS_1134125] of sPI), then repeat at one month and threemonths post-
discharge follow-ups (to determine lasting effects). Outcomes will be assessed through standardized 
scales (e.g., FACIT-Fatigue Scale) and objective measures (e.g., actigraphy, daysimeter for light monitoring, 
melatonin from urine collection, blood inflammatory markers, all explained below). This trial will: 1) be 
the first randomized clinical trial ( RCT) to investigate the effects of sPI [INVESTIGATOR_818904]; 2) focus on a distinct, relatively homogenous patient population 
(MM-HSCT patients) with high prevalence of CRF; and 3) explore possible circadian rhythm mediation via 
melatonin analysis and blood analysis. This investigation will have major public health relevance as it will 
determine if an inexpensive and low patient burden intervention (sPI) is able to control fatigue associated 
with medical illness es and related problems.

before and during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818918]. Hypothesis 3 f: Monitoring of light exposure via
Daysimeter data among HSCT patients will be acceptable as an assessment method before and
during HSCT.
2)Backgrou nd
Debilitating fatigue – a persistent sense of exhaustion frequently associated with a number of serious 
medical conditions, including cancer – can interfere with mood, activities of daily living, treatment 
compliance. Such fatigue is often associated with sleep problems, depression, quality of life, and 
agitation. Unfortunately, currently available interventions for CRF are, at best, only modestly effective. 
Pharmacologic al agents have been studied for CRF, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend their 
use. Non-pharmacologic al interventions have shown clinical benefit, but they can be labor-intensive, 
expensive, and cumbersome for patients. A promising alternative is light therapy.  
Although CRF is well documented, it is difficult to characterize because it has a poorly delineated etiology. 
Circadian rhythm disruption ( CRD) has been hypothesized to play an important role in the etiology of CRF 
by [CONTACT_818960]. Circadian rhythms are 
genera ted and regulated by [CONTACT_818961]; they  are biological cycles (e.g., changes in hormone secretion, body temperature, and 
sleep -wake activity cycles) that are slightly longer than [ADDRESS_1134126] synchronizers of circadian rhythms, which are maintained through 
entrainment by [CONTACT_818962]. Light therapy incorporating systematic exposure to bluish-

Revise d 9/2/[ADDRESS_1134127] sleep quantity and quality, depression, and fatigue among cancer patients. The proposed research 
will investigate the delivery of sPI [INVESTIGATOR_67078] a novel delivery system to treat CRF, experienced by [CONTACT_8622] 80% of all 
cancer patients. Although CRF has been found to be related to CRD and it is known that bright light 
improves rhythms, the effect of sPI [INVESTIGATOR_818919]. Further, CRF has been found to be 
related to sleep disturbances, as well as to depression, yet the effect of sPI [INVESTIGATOR_818920]. 
Inflammatory response have been proposed to underlie CRF.  There is an association between CRF among 
cancer patients and activation of pro-inflammatory signaling. For example, breast cancer survivors with 
persistent fatigue have elevated levels of markers associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine activity 
including Interleukin-[ADDRESS_1134128] (IL-1ra), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 
type II (sTNF-RII), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP) . It has also 
been shown that chemotherapy leads to significant elevations in inflammation which is associated with 
increases in fatigue.  
In the proposed preliminary feasibility research, sPI [INVESTIGATOR_818921], low-level, 
bluish-white light to patients during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818922]. We have selected cancer patients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818923]: (1) is relatively homogenous with a high prevalence of CRF, (2) can be studied 
prospectively across the course of HSCT, (3) permits careful monitoring of circadian rhythm entrainment 
through analysis of melatonin from urine obtained before, during and after HSCT, (4) regularly has blood 
drawn for clinical purposes and (5) allows assessment and control of confounding variables.  
Preliminary research: 
The proposed exploratory study bui lds on Redd’s, Figueiro’s, and Ancoli -Israel’s  complementary areas of 
research. Redd, Ancoli- Israel and colleagues’ ongoing investigation of BWL to treat CRF in cancer 
(including HSCT) survivors has formed the conceptual template for the proposed study and points to the 
potential importance of s PI [INVESTIGATOR_818924] . In previous studies, they were able to 
retain 71% of participants, a retention rate that we also expect for the proposed protocol.  
Both Redd’s and Ancoli- Israel’s work supports the proposed study in 6 ways: (1) It provides the conceptual 
rationale for light as an intervention for negative sequelae of cancer treatment ; (2) It established the 
acceptability of light treatment by [CONTACT_76428]; (3) It determined the overall feasibility of lighting 
interventions with a cancer population, indicating that patients were: a) able to implement the light 
intervention with minimal involvement by [CONTACT_3647], b) adherent to home-based treatment regimens, 
and c) able to successfully complete all study assessments; (4) It confirms a low-lux light treatment as an

Revise d 9/2/14 appropriate comparison condition; (5) It provides clear procedural guidelines; (6) It demonstrates the 
importance of examining sPI [INVESTIGATOR_818925].  
Figueiro has shown that using an ambient light treatment can improve sleep and behavior in patients with 
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia . Using knowledge of human circadian phototransduction, which 
is how the retina converts light signals into neural signals to the brain, Figueiro was able to provide most 
of the ambient light’s radiant power in a range that has the greatest effect on circadian rhythms. This 
allows us to reduce overall sPI [INVESTIGATOR_818926], 
possibly increasing treatment compliance.  
 
Recent work by [CONTACT_818963] -Israel, Redd, and Liu revealed that breast cancer and HSCT patients were light -
deprived. Compared to healthy adults in an illumination study who received [ADDRESS_1134129] patients in our preliminary light exposure study for cancer -related fatigue only received 30 minutes 
of bright light per day. Their findings provide additiona l evidence that sPI [INVESTIGATOR_818927].

Research procedures will be performed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (MSH) and the 
Rensselaer ’s Lighting Research Center (RLC) .  
 
The RPI [INVESTIGATOR_818928], informing and 
assisting with all protocols performed at MSH, processing and analyzing data, and writing reports. The IRB 
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is a full board review, and will assess and approve the proposed 
research protocol at one of their regularly scheduled meetings.  
 
Mount Sinai's Human Immune Monitoring Core Shared Resource Facility staff will be responsible for 
storing and processing blood samples.  
 
4) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research 
Cancer survivors who will receive  autologous  HSCT for treatment of MM  will be recruited from Mount 
Sinai. All patients will be randomly assigned to either the active  or comparison condition. We expect to

[CONTACT_4490] a supervising licensed psychologist.  T he research team will look at each subject’s CES -D scores at all 
timepoints to determine if they are at risk for severe depression. The protocol states that if a CES-D score is 
above 16, then the supervising psychologist will call the patient to determine if they need to be referred to 
get professional help regarding potential clinical depression. The BDI-II also can be used as a screener for 
depression. If a subject endorses suicidal ideation (by [CONTACT_49419] 2 or 3 for question 9, or scores in the 
severely depressed range between 29-63), then the supervising psychologist will also call the patient.

Revise d 9/2/[ADDRESS_1134135] admissions 
to treat MM  at the MSH  bone marrow transplant  (BMT) clinic . Our previous research has demonstrated 
that at least 40% of this group either suffers from or will develop clinically significant fatigue related to 
cancer or its treatment.  
d) Study Timelines 
Total participation in this study is  16-18 week s, and may vary by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_063], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210], and expediency of returning study related materials.   
Endpoints 
The primary endpoints in the proposed study are: 1) Fatigue as measured by a simple Graphic Rating 
Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue FACIT Fatigue Scale, and The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]; 3) 
Depression as measured by [CONTACT_150216]-D; 4) Quality of Life measured by [CONTACT_20763]-36 scale; 5)Sleep/wake 
activity measured using a nactigraph; and 7) Biological variables melatonin and inflammatory markers (i.e.,  
IL-1ra, IL-6, MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1a/CCL3, sTNFr1, sIL-6R, CRP ) as obtained via urine and blood analysis.  
 
The secondary endpoints include: 1) the amount of light received by [CONTACT_818965];2) treatment satisfaction using the FACIT- TS-G scale, and 3) Psychological moderators (e.g., 
emotions, symptom burden ) that may affect for whom the treatment is effective. 
 
With regard to safety endpoints, there are no known major risks associated with the use of bright white 
light in the treatment of either fatigue or depression. However, we will monitor those who decide to 
cease treatment because they find the treatment approach unacceptable along with their concerns 
regarding treatment. 
  
e) Procedures Involved in the Human Research 
Approach:  We will explore the acceptability, feasibility and potential efficacy of s PI [INVESTIGATOR_818932], as provided during  their inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818933]. We will also determine the feasibility of investigating 
biological  markers (i.e.  melatonin , inflammatory markers ) as mediators of the clinical impact on CRF. 
Urine samples  will be collected  at two timepoints  to assess melatonin rhythmicity. Blood samples will be 
collected at four timepoints to assess the inflammatory response  in relationship to the light treatment.  
The proposed approach will be informed by [CONTACT_818966]’s patients. Additionally, we will be building on our previously established 
protocols to inform our ability to research s PI [CONTACT_3148]. The two teams of investigators will work closely, 
carrying out weekly conference calls and quarterly face-to -face meetings alternating between MSH and 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ( RPI). The MSH team will recruit study participants and oversee use of the 
light fixtures, monitoring equipment, assessment scales , and facilitate with Figueiro’s laboratory regarding 
proper storage and analysis of urine samples.  MSH will also collaborate with the Mount Sinai's Human

Methods: MM patients who will receive an autologous HSCT as part of their treatment plan will be 
recruited from MSH , and will be randomly assigned to either the BWL or the DWL  conditions. Participants 
in both treatment arms will complete baseline 1 assessment at the time they are recruited.  If Baseline 1 is 
completed more than two months before transplant participants will complete baseline 2 approximately 
one month before their transplant.  After the baseline(s) assessment partic ipants will be assessed: (A) 
during the inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818934], day + 2, day +  7; (B) engraftment day 3 (most likely 
during week 2 -3): (C)  one month  after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] ; and (D) three months after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] . 
Outcome mea sures include standardized questionnaire measures of CRF , depression , sleep quality, and 
quality of life, as well as analysis of urinary melatonin  and blood inflammatory marker levels  at both 
outpatient and inpatient timepoints to monitor the biological pr ocesses believed to be influenced by [CONTACT_818967].  
This assessment schedule will allow us to evaluate the immediate and post -treatment benefits of the sPI 
[CONTACT_3148].  
The proposed statistical analyses examine a number of  related questions. The first consists of a 
comparison of the impact of the sPI [INVESTIGATOR_818935] a comparison condition on CRF , depression, 
sleep q
uality, circadian rhythmicity , and quality of life  using both the self- report  and objective out come 
measures  (i.e. actigraphy data)  in MM patients  undergoing autologous HSCT . The second will examine the 
possible mediating role of depression , sleep quality,  circadian activity rhythms, and  fatigue  on the effects 
of sPI . Lastly , the third  will assess the feasibility  and acceptability  of an sPI [INVESTIGATOR_818936], actigraphy, urine 
melatonin analysis, and light exposure monitoring during HSCT.   We will also look at possible co -
moderators that may influence for whom the treatment works as defined by [CONTACT_818968]. In addition,  we will explore whether the light treatment improves fatigue and 
depression through biological mediators analyzed in blood, i.e. inflammatory markers.  
Please see the Data Safety and Monitoring Plan in section 5h for procedures taken to lessen the 
probability or magnitude of risks.  
Data about subjects will be collected from medical charts, urine samples, blood samples,  questionnaires 
that the participants will fill out, and output from the equipment (i.e., Actigraph and Daysimeter data).

throughout the entire study. It will be in the judgment of the consenting professional and/or as per medical 
record to determine if a patient may have severe psychopathology or cognitive impairment likely to interfere with 
the participation or completion of the protocol or ability to provide meaningful information. In this case, 
professional will decide not to include potential participant in the study.  
The following questionnaires will be completed during the study: 
Background Measures: 
Background Information Questionnaire – Socio-demographic data regarding gender, age, ethnicity,
religion, income, marital status, and employment status will be gathered during the screening
assessment and any changes in information will be gathered at the follow-up assessments. We will
assess co-morbid medical conditions and current prescription sleep-related and non-sleep-related
medications.
Chronotype (MEQ) – We will collect data on baseline circadian predispositions using the Morningness-
Eveningness Questionnaire, a 19-item self-rated survey designed to measure wh ether a person’s peak
alertness is in the morning or the evening. Takes approximately 2 minutes to complete.
Credibility Measures: 
Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire – This questionnaire will ask whether the patient feels the light
box is a useful and/or effective treatment for CRF.
Sleep and Fatigue Measures: 
Sleep Log – The sleep log will ask the participant to note what time she/he went to bed, what time
she/he got out of bed, any times the Daysimeter and/or Actiwatch was removed, and whether she/h e
spent any time sitting very still (such as at the movies). The sleep log will be used to help edit
actigraphy data.
FACIT-Fatigue Scale – The FACIT-Fatigue scale will be used both for selection of patients into the study
and as an outcome measure of fatigue. Smith et al. (1999) report that this [ADDRESS_1134138] reliability (r = 0.90) and internal consistency reliability (alpha = 0.93-0.95). In addition,
criterion related validity studies using objective measures of physical function as the outcome show

Fatigue score equal to or less than 33 constitutes clinically significant fatigue. 
Fatigue Line Scale – Simple numeric graphic rating scale, marked on a line numbering 0-100. Replaces
the FACIT fatigue scale for daily fatigue assessment during inpatient procedures.
Multidimensional Fatigue --The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20-item self-report
instrument designed to measure fatigue. It covers the following dimensions: General Fatigue, Physical
Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motivation and Reduced Activity. Tested for its psychometric
properties in cancer patients receiving radiotherapy, patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome,
psychology students, medical students, army recruits and junior physicians, it was found to have good
Test-retest Reliability (r=0.80) and great Internal Consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92).
The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] – The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_464553] 19 self-rated items.
Scale reli ability is excellent using both an internal consistency criterion (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.83) and
test-retest reliability (r = 0.85). The validity of the instrument is based on its ability to discriminate
patients (those having either sleep problems and/or depressive symptoms) from controls (healthy
participants without sleep complaints).

Tempus tubes, delivered within 30 minutes, and processed immediately in the laboratories of Mount 
Sinai's Human Immune Monitoring Core Shared Resource Facility according to established blood 
processing protocols. 
g)Data Management and Confidentiality
All data obtained will be placed into individual research participant folders and stored in a locked file 
cabinet in the department of Oncological Sciences. Only study personnel will have access to this file 
cabinet. All folders and data pertaining to individual subjects will be identified only by a code number and 
only the PI (Redd)  and Co-investigator (Valdimarsdottir)  the research coordinator s will have access to 
electronic file that links the numbers to patient identities. Upon completion of the study, the file tha t links 
patients to the codes will be deleted.  
Data sent between RPI, Mount Sinai, and the participants will be shipped via UPS. Patient names and 
dates of birth will not be included in mailed data to protect patient privacy. Mailed data will only be 
identified with study-ID numbers. RPI [INVESTIGATOR_818942], and will not receive any 
protected health information (PHI) other than the results of the biological assessments as well as 
assessments taken over the course of the study.  
Data from any web -based assessment tools will be accessible to research study team using password 
protection and will only be identified by [CONTACT_236158]. Paper files and printouts of assessment 
scores will be kept in a locked cabinet with access only by [CONTACT_818969]. The use of 
email will be in accordance with MSH policy (i.e. secure email, obtaining consent from subject to send 
email, etc.). 
Urine and blood samples will be marked only by [CONTACT_818970]. 
Data Analysis: 
Descriptive statistics will be calculated both for the entire group and separately for each treatment group. 
T-tests and Fisher’s exact tests will be used to assess group differences at baseline for possible 
confounders (i.e., demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and medications). Any variables showing 
differences between the two groups will be used as covariates in subsequent analyses. Since there is no 
known seasonality effect to measures of fatigue or to measures of sleep, which are our main outcome 
measures, seasonality will not be controlled in these analyses.  For the primary outcome (Fatigue),   the

with repeated measures. Besides time (linear and possibly quadratic trends to allow for possible nonlinear 
trends), any covariates identified in the preliminary analyses and intervention group will be assessed in a 
fixed effects model. Each model will also include a random intercept. Post-hoc comparisons will be Tukey-
adjusted. Since there are multiple secondary outcomes, the p-values will be Sidak adjusted for correlate d 
multiple comparisons. Any variations in length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (i.e., length of intervention) will be used as 
a covariate in all analyses. This is highly unexpected since 90% of ASCT patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] 14 
days. In the Analysis of Aim 2, we will establish that the treatment is a significant predictor of the primary 
outcome (CRF) as well as the hypothesized mediators. Next, we will first examine the role of each of the 
mediators of the effects of sPI [INVESTIGATOR_818943], the treatment main effect, and the time by [CONTACT_9866]. Each mediator which is a 
significant predictor of CRF in this equation will then be combined with any other significant mediating 
predictor of CRF into a single equation. We predict the introduction of each significant mediator will result

Data, Safety, and Monitoring Plan 
The following plan addresses the four essential elements noted in NCI’s 2001 outline: “Essential Elements 
of a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for Clinical Trials Funded by [CONTACT_29630].”  
1.Monitoring the progress of trials and the safety of participants.
The proposed research is a low-risk behavioral trial. Study staff will be available to participants who have 
any difficulty with their equipment or any unexpected reaction during the intervention period. Study staff 
will be required to report all serious adverse events (SAEs) to the Mount Sinai IRB according to policies 
and procedures outlined by [CONTACT_464613]. Study staff members are also responsible to report all SAEs to the 
study PI [CONTACT_23982]. As per Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai ’s IRB policies, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_818947]. The study staff PIs will monitor the progress of the trial and safety of participants on an ongoing 
basis. The procedures of this study will ensure discussion and reporting of all possible outcomes including 
adverse events. If the adverse event is due to the intervention and is unexpected, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9965] a safety 
report and send a copy to the Mount Sinai IRB. The IRB committee will serve as an objective review 
mechanism. This policy/procedure means that any potential conflict of interest inherent in the PI [INVESTIGATOR_818948]. 
We will use screening procedures from our prior grants to assess depression/suicidality. If risk of 
suicidality or severe depression is revealed, a licensed clinical psychologist in [LOCATION_001] State, will contact 
[CONTACT_464614], taking emergency steps and making referrals as needed.  
2. Plans for assuring adherence with requirements regarding the reporting of adverse events
(AEs). 
All serious AEs (e.g., medical occurrences resulting in either hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059]) that occur during the 
study defined by [CONTACT_62325], regardless of the relation to the research, must be reported to the 
IRB by [CONTACT_756], e-mail or fax within 24 hou rs of the investigator’s awareness of the occurrence of the

Revise d 9/2/14 event. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_818949]. These safety reports are a written account of an SAE determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_818950]. Serious AEs 
will be summarized annually in the IRB application for continuation or termination of research. 
All expected non-serious AEs that occur at a greater frequency or severity than anticipated and all 
unexpected non-serious AEs will be reported to the Mount Sinai IRB within 15 working days of the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_223305]. Adverse events that will be reported include suicidal ideation, which will be 
monitoring at each check-in. These AEs are also summarized annually in the IRB application for 
continuation or termination of the research.   
3. Plans for assuring that any action resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of an
NCI-funded clinical trial is reported to the NCI grant program director responsible for the grant. 
The Director of the Grants and Contracts Office at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will provide 
prompt written notification of any action resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of this 
protocol to the NCI grant program director responsible for the grant.  
4. Plans for assuring data accuracy and protocol adherence.
Data that will be collected from study participants will be in the form of self-report measures, actigraphy 
data, urine collection, and information from Daysimeter light monitors. These measures will generate 
information concerning: 1) fatigue; 2) sleep patterns; 3) depression; 4) biological mediators of the 
investigated symptoms; 6) general quality- of-life and information on common cancer treatment-related 
sequelae; and 5) socio-demographic and medical variables. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_818951]. The research team will have 
conference calls as stated above to monitor any adherence or accuracy problems that may arise in the 
course of the study. To ensure the validity and integrity of study data, a research coordinator will be 
blinded to the treatment assignment. The blinded research coordinator will oversee data management 
responsibilities (e.g., data entry and data checking) while the unblinded research coordinator will oversee 
the active and comparison light intervention . All research coordinators and Meschian will discuss data 
accuracy and management issues with the study PI. RAs will be in close communication with RPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_818952].

Revise d 9/2/14  If used incorrectly (e.g. such as staring directly into the light) it may cause eye discomfort or eye strain 
 Likelihood of Harm : There will be minimal risk to the participants. Light levels will be much lower than 
those experienced when subjects are outdoors during a bright sunny day. The subjects will not be exposed 
to ultraviolet radiation.   
 Light levels used in this experiment are lower than the levels produced by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_818953]-light boxes (which 
is 10,000 lux) or produced at midday in a clear sunny day (about 100,000 lux). Using hazardous light 
exposure levels specified by [CONTACT_818979],  one would 
need to be exposed to this light source for more than 10 hours continuously before it becomes a risk. 
 Major research has not found increased risks of using light therapy for most major eye diseases. However, 
in the unlikely event the participant feels that the light is affecting their eyes or vision, they will be advised 
to contact [CONTACT_818980]. 
 Previous research suggests that light therapy can improve the effectiveness of some antidepressant drugs.  
No evidence to date suggests that it decreases the effectiveness. If the participant is concerned about 
this, they will be advised to consult their physician.    
 Completing questionnaires during the study may cause some distress or discomfort, however, past 
research has shown that such distress is usually minimal and transient. 
 Wearing the light monitor (Daysimeter) and/or activity monitor (Actigraph) may cause discomfort. If this 
discomfort is unmanageable, the participant will be asked to  report such discomfort to the research 
coordinator. 
 Risks associated with blood draws: There is a minimal risk of pain, bruising, swelling, dizziness, or 
infection when blood is drawn from your arm. Some people feel dizzy or may faint during or after 
a blood draw. To minimize risk, blood for research purposes will only be drawn at the same time 
as routine clinical blood draws.  
 
7) Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury 
 
The proposed project is a low-risk behavioral study. We will inform participants during the consent 
process that there is a chance that they will experience potential side effects of light therapy, e.g., sleep 
disturbance, headache, eyestrain, nausea, and hyperactivity, and in very rare instances, photic 
maculopathy, photophobia, hypomania, and suicidal ideation/suicide attempts have occurred (in those 
with pre-existing severe depression). They will be informed that such side effects are usually minimal if 
the light is positioned correctly and when they do occur, resolve within a few days. During the course of 
the protocol, if after [ADDRESS_1134147] even after discontinuation of the light exposure. Medical concerns will 
be billed according to other procedures occurring during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], since this is an inpatient study.

We will also inform patients during the consent process that there is a chance participants will feel some 
distress or discomfort as a result of answering some questions asked during the study or completing the 
neuropsychological assessment. Participants will be assured that they can refuse to answer any questions 
or withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. Participants’ psychological symptoms will be 
monitored throughout the study. If any participant expresses severe suicidal ideation, evidences acute or 
emergency psychiatric symptoms, or asks for psychiatric care, a referral will be made. The RA will be 
trained to identify participants who may be experiencing such problems and discuss them with Meschian 
(a Ph.D.-level licensed clinical psychologist). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_818954], if necessary. If additional psychiatric care is warranted, participation in 
the study will be discontinued. Any participants presenting with physical complaints will be referred to 
their oncologist for evaluation so that the oncologist can rule out organic causes and/or make additional 
referrals, if needed. Participants who are assessed as having significant cognitive impairment and 
significant sleep dysfunction will also be referred to their oncologist for evaluation.

treatment. Subject fatigue may return after they stop s PI [INVESTIGATOR_818955].  
9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects 
 
All study data collected will be also stored electronically. The data will be stored on a MSH  network drive, 
accessible only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_335992]. The data will be password protected. During 
data summarization and analysis, individual participants will be identified by [CONTACT_120467]. No data 
identifying individual participants will be published or disclosed to third parties without prior consent of 
the participant.  A list matching names with code numbers will be kept in a separate computer file and 
folder from the one where the data is stored.  
 
If a participant  agrees to participate in the study, all questionnaires will be labeled with the participants’ 
study ID number, not their name [CONTACT_818987]. Subjects will be informed that 
they can choose to not answer any questions t hat make them feel uncomfortable. Subjects will need to 
give study personnel their home addresses to which the study materials and questionnaires can be sent. 
This data will be kept private on the MSH  network drive in a password protected spreadsheet. Subj ects 
will mail back all study materials in a pre -paid envelope with an ID number and an MSH  address as the 
return address.  
 
Participants  will provide the study team with a telephone number on which we can call them to 
administer questionnaires and help wi th any issues. If we need to leave a message, we will ensure that no

10) Economic Impact on Subjects 
We do not expect the subjects to incur any foreseeable costs through their participation in our study. We 
will be shippi[INVESTIGATOR_818956]’s home at our expense.  Lights, actigraphs, a nd 
daysimeters will be provided to clients at no cost during the study. Blood draws at Mount Sinai will be 
scheduled on days of routine clinical visits, eliminating any additional transportation or cost to the 
subject. 
 
11) Payments to Subjects 
Study participants will receive a $25 reimbursement for each time-point (study is divided into five time 
points – baseline 1, baseline 2, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 1-month post and 3- months post). For a participant who 
completes the entire study this will come to a total of $125 paid in two check installments of $50 (or $ [ADDRESS_1134148] installment if  baseline 2 administered). This payment plan was established because subjects 
will not need to come into Mount Sinai specifically for the research study. Therefore, it will be more 
practical to request and send participants two checks, rather than five/six different checks throughout the 
duration of the study.   
12) Consent Process 
Informed consent will be obtained from participants in person before the collection of any data - Eligible 
patients will be contact[CONTACT_818982] ( time to transplant varies between 
patients) to MSH and given information on the study. The study coordinator will then administer the 
informed consent process. The R C will: describe the stud y, give the subject’s time to read the consent 
form, allow the subjects to discuss their decision with whomever they like, allow the subjects to digest the 
information, and allow the patients to ask the member of the study team any additional questions the y 
might have.  
 
All consented participants will be informed about study procedures, extent of participation, and potential 
risks and that their participation is voluntary and will not jeopardize their relationship and participation in 
any activity they conduct or care that they receive at MSH. Participants will also be provided with a 
telephone number where they can call if they have any questions or concerns about the study or the 
consent form.  
 
13) Process to Document Consent in Writing 
We will be asking participants to sign the standard PPHS consent template.  
14) Vulnerable Populations 
Indicate specifically whether you will include (target) or exclude each of the following populations:

15) Multi-Site Human Research (Coordinating Center) 
All information will be stored and managed by [CONTACT_818983] . Actigraphs, Daysimeters , sampling materials, 
and questionnaires  will be mailed between the participants and the study team at MSH . No identifying 
information will be included on the equipment and questionnaires will only include code numbers. MSH  
will send  RPI [INVESTIGATOR_818957]. Blood samples will be analyzed at 
Mount Sinai's Human Immune Monitoring Core Shared Resource Facility . Urine samples will be analyzed 
at the laboratory at RPI [INVESTIGATOR_818958] . Samples will only be identified by [CONTACT_4317]' study -ID numbers.

17) Sharing of Results with Subjects 
If patients request information about the study results (i.e., whether light exposure was clinically effective 
in reducing cancer related fatigue ), we will provide them with a copy of the publication that details the 
results.  
18) External IRB Review History

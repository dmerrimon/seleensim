71.OBJECTIVES
1.1Study Design
Within the gastroenterology practice of [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH), we will conduct 
a prospective, single-arm clinical trial to measure the effects of daily 4-gram eicosapentaenoic 
acid (EPA), through treatment with AMR101 (VASCEPA, icosapent ethyl) on urine, stool and 
tissue biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer. 
1.2Primary Objectives
To measure the effect of daily 4-gram AMR101 treatment on fatty acid composition in colorectal 
tissue among individuals with a history of colorectal adenoma.
1.3Secondary Objectives
To measure the effect of EPA treatment on the gut microbiome and metabolome, urinary 
prostaglandin metabolites (PGE-M) and gene expression profile of colorectal tissue among 
individuals with a history of colorectal adenoma.
2.BACKGROUND
2.1Study Disease(s)
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
in the U.S. In 2016, an estimated 95,[ADDRESS_1177580] a slightly higher lifetime probability of receiving a colorectal cancer diagnosis (5.0%) 
compared to women (4.7%).[ADDRESS_1177581] two decades; and at a slightly higher 
rate over the last [ADDRESS_1177582] among all cancer deaths with only an approximate 65% five-year 
survival rate, necessitating further advances in cancer prevention.2
2.2IND Agent(s)
N/A; Exempt.
This study will investigate the effects of standard-dose EPA treatment using the FDA-approved 
drug AMR101, and meets the five exemption criteria as laid out by 21 CFR 312.2(b):
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
8The drug product is lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002].
The drug AMR101 used for the study is FDA approved and lawfully marketed in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
The investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well-controlled study in 
support of a new indication and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant 
change in the labeling of the drug.
The end points of the study are mechanistic biomarkers related to EPA and are not 
used in any clinical context.
In the case of a prescription drug, the investigation is not intended to support a significant 
change in the advertising for the drug.
The study aims to investigate the potential anti-cancer mechanisms of EPA and is not 
intended to support any change in the advertising for the drug AMR101.
The investigation does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or 
other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk) 
associated with the use of the drug product (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)).
AMR101 used in the proposed study is made of ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which are natural substances found in the oil of certain 
fish, and will be orally administered in a standard dose (4 g/day) in people who are 
being evaluated for colorectal cancer.   
The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by [CONTACT_2717] 
(21 CFR part 56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50).
The protocol will be submitted to the Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center IRB, who 
will also review the informed consent documents.

investigation is not intended to promote or commercialize the drug product).
The study is not intended to promote or commercialize any drug product.
Our application for an IND exempt has been approved by [CONTACT_846907] 2 
(DOP2) of the FDA (see the attached formal letter, IND 141418. Please note that the name [CONTACT_846948]). 
2.3Other Agent(s)
AMR101
AMR101 (icosapent ethyl) is a prescription medicine for adults to lower blood levels of 
triglycerides. It is supplied as a liquid-filled gel capsule for oral administration. The standard 
dose is 4 g per day (administered as 8 half-gram capsules). Each 0.5-gram capsule of AMR101 
contains 0.5 gram of icosapent ethyl, which is an ethyl ester of the omega-3 fatty acid 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). 
EPA possesses triglyceride-lowering and anti-inflammatory activities, and has been suggested to 
be beneficial for a variety of health outcomes in adults, including coronary heart disease,[ADDRESS_1177583] of EPA.9 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
9Besides EPA, AMR101 capsules also contain the following inactive ingredients: tocopherol, 
gelatin, glycerin, maltitol, sorbitol, and purified water.
2.4Rationale
Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US.[ADDRESS_1177584] of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, EPA supplement of 2 g daily for 6 
months reduces the number and size of polyps by 20-30%, an effect comparable to that by [CONTACT_1556]-approved prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2, also known as COX-2) 
inhibitors.[ADDRESS_1177585] of EPA may be related to its multifaceted immunomodulatory activity 
mediated by [CONTACT_846908].14 These changes alter gene expression and the activities of several key immune 
signaling pathways, such as PTGS2 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B 
cells (NF-κB), and modify downstream metabolite production, including a decrease in 
proinflammatory eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandin E 2; PGE 2) and an increase in pro-resolving 
lipid mediators (e.g., resolvin and protectin).14-[ADDRESS_1177586] by [CONTACT_846909] (e.g., reduction of IL-10 
expression).[ADDRESS_1177587] of 60 patients with solid tumors, supplementation of EPA increased the 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
10ratio of T-helper cells to T-suppressor cells in the peripheral blood of the malnourished patients, 
and prolonged the survival of all the patients.23 
Our recent observational study indicated that high EPA intake was associated with lower risk of 
colorectal cancer that is infiltrated with a high density of FOXP3+ T cells, but not tumors with 
low densities of FOXP3+ T cells.[ADDRESS_1177588] proliferation of T effector (Teff) cells.24 
Consistent with our human findings, we found that EPA treatment decreased the suppressive 
activity of FOXP3+ Treg cells in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, the suppressive effect of 
EPA leveled off at around [ADDRESS_1177589] that the gut microbiota play an important role in colorectal cancer 
development and progression, possibly by [CONTACT_846910].25 Among all potential shapi[INVESTIGATOR_173326], diet is particularly important for the gut 
microbial composition and function. Compared to other types of fat, EPA has been associated 
with enhanced intestinal microbiota diversity and EPA-rich diet ameliorates omega-6 fatty acids- 
or antibiotics-induced dysbiosis.26-29 Animal studies indicate that EPA supplements increase the 
abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria, such as lactic acid-producing bacteria (mainly 
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium), and decrease the abundance of immunosuppressive and pro-
inflammatory bacteria, such as F. nucleatum, Escherichia coli, and Akkermansia. Administration 
of Bifidobacterium has been shown to improve patients’ response to cancer immunotherapy,[ADDRESS_1177590] immune response.  
 
3.PARTICIPANT SELECTION
Patients that meet the eligibility criteria will be identified through investigators during their routine 
clinical practice, supplemented by a periodic query of the MGH endoscopy (Provation) and 
pathology database. Patients also may be identified using Natural Language Processing clinical 
software that queries medical records. The MGH gastroenterologist that performed the procedure 
or saw the patient for outpatient care as follow-up to the patient’s colonoscopy procedure will be 
notified and asked for permission to contact [CONTACT_195345]. We plan to recruit patients who have 
undergone a colonoscopy by [CONTACT_846911]. In some cases, these physicians may not be members of the study team. 
However, non-study physicians will not perform study-related procedures. 
For appropriate patients, we will identify their preference for contact [CONTACT_846912] 
(Research Opportunities Direct to You [RODY] status) through queries of the Research Patient 
Data Registry (RPDR). Participants with a RODY YES response will be contact[CONTACT_426] a letter 
(attached recruitment letter for RODY YES patients) from the study PI. Patients with a RODY 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
11NO response or without RODY designation will be contact[CONTACT_426] a different letter (attached 
recruitment letter for RODY NO patients). If the colonoscopy was performed at MGH, after an 
adenoma is resected from a patient at MGH, all gastroenterologists routinely contact [CONTACT_846913]. The recruitment letter will be included with 
the pathology results when possible, or it will be sent separately after the pathology report. If the 
colonoscopy and polypectomy were performed at another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the MGH gastroenterologist 
will confirm the prior diagnosis of an adenoma through review of pathology reports. Their 
treating MGH gastroenterologist, regardless of whether the physician is study personnel, will 
sign the letter. If no response is received to this recruitment letter within two weeks (10 business 
days) a follow-up phone call or email will be placed by a research assistant/study coordinator 
(phone script/sample email attached). In some cases, the treating gastroenterologist may 
approach the patient following the colonoscopy that identified a polyp if he/she feels the patient 
would be a good candidate for the study. In these cases, the patients may not receive a 
recruitment letter as the primary method of contact. Instead, they will be directly contact[CONTACT_617672] (see call script/sample email) from a member of the research team prior to 
mailing the letter (if requested). Potential participants will have additional opportunities to ask 
any questions by [CONTACT_846914] a trained research coordinator. If the participant is 
interested in participating, eligibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_9137] (see script) and 
confirmed by [CONTACT_846915]’ medical record (see 
“Investigator Representation for Review of Protected Health Information Preparatory to 
Research” form). If eligibility is confirmed, the patient will be scheduled for their initial study 
visit and registered with OnCore by [CONTACT_5984]. The informed consent form will be mailed to 
the patient prior to the initial visit so that he or she can read it in detail, if requested by [CONTACT_2416]. Eligible participants will provide written informed consent at the baseline visit prior 
to participation in the study. The consenting process will be performed by [CONTACT_846916]’s 
clinical investigators.

Bivalirudin, Argatroban, Lepi[INVESTIGATOR_8412], Heparin Sodium, Heparin/Dextrose, and an 
unwillingness or inability to discontinue anticoagulants.
3.2.10 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or 
psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/[ADDRESS_1177595] agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or 
barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of 
study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she 
is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. 
Similarly, lactating women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but 
potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother 
with AMR101. Consequently, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is 
enrolled on the study.
3.2.[ADDRESS_1177596] for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, or 
acute or chronic hepatitis B infection.
Participants with these infections are ineligible because they are at increased risk of 
significant complications in the perioperative period, and because fresh tissue from 
patients with these infections cannot be harvested for research purposes, per 
institutional policy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving 
combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
3.3Inclusion of Women and Minorities
Women and minorities will be eligible for this study without alteration in eligibility criteria. 
Enrollment of these underrepresented populations to this trial will be encouraged.
4.REGISTRATION PROCEDURES
4.1General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) 
OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of protocol therapy. Any participant not 
registered to the protocol before protocol therapy begins will be considered ineligible and 
registration will be denied.
An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the 
protocol-specific eligibility checklist.
The study staff will register the participant in OnCore.
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
14Following registration, participants may begin protocol-specific therapy and/or intervention. 
Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal 
Investigator (PI). If the subject does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the 
subject must be taken off-study in the CTMS (OnCore) with an appropriate date and reason 
entered.

5.TREATMENT PLAN
5.1Treatment Regimen
After study registration, eligible participants will be assigned unique study identification numbers. 
The investigator will contact [CONTACT_846917]. The MGH 
Research Pharmacy will dispense study capsules, obtained from Amarin Pharma (Bedminster, NJ), 
containing 0.5-gram of AMR101. The assigned dosage will not change over the course of the study 
unless dose reduction is indicated (See Section 6). The first dose of the study medication will be 
given to patients after the initial flexible sigmoidoscopy. Participants will be expected to take 4 
capsules orally, twice a day, until the return for their final visit (minimum 8 weeks, maximum 12 
weeks). The final visit, 8-12 weeks from the baseline visit, will be scheduled during or before the 
baseline visit. The MGH Research Pharmacy will assign the participant three bottles of AMR101 
each containing 240 capsules (12 weeks, 8 capsules/day) and participants will return any unused 
capsules and the bottle to the study staff at their final visit. The bottle will be labeled with their 
participant ID. The participant number must be recorded on the drug dispensation form  and in the 
participants case report form (CRF). These numbers are unique to each participant and must not 
be re-assigned. Remaining capsules will be counted as a measure of compliance, the number 
recorded and then the remaining capsules will be immediately destroyed. Weekly calls will be 
used to monitor adherence and adverse events. Patients who initiate fish oil supplements during 
the study will be withdrawn and an exit visit performed.
Compliance will be assessed based on drug diary and pi[INVESTIGATOR_734040], as well as blood measurement 
of EPA levels. Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7. No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_846871]. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_846872]’ data periodically throughout the 
duration of the study for quality, validity and integrity assurance and for adherence to the IRB

5.3Agent Administration
5.3.1 AMR101
Participants will self-administer eight AMR101 capsules by [CONTACT_1966] (4 capsules twice a day), and 
will be instructed to keep a drug diary. The dose should be taken with food and a full glass of 
water. If a daily dose is missed, the dose should be skipped. A dose is considered missed if more 
than 24 hours has elapsed since the prior dose.

5.5General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines
Throughout the study, treating investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments 
deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care. However, participants may not receive: 
Other investigational agents;
Anticoagulant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including Heparin, Warfarin, Dalteparin sodium, Bivalirudin, 
Argatroban, Lepi[INVESTIGATOR_8412], Heparin Sodium, Heparin/Dextrose, and other anticoagulant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];
Any supplements that contain EPA.
All prescribed and non-prescription concomitant medications that are ingested, applied, or injected 
on an ongoing basis from signing of the informed consent, as well as changes in such concomitant 
medications, and any new concomitant medication taken while the participant is on study, should

7.ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an 
observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited reporting in 
addition to routine reporting.
7.1Expected Toxicities
AMR101 may produce a hypersensitivity reaction in individuals with known hypersensitivity to 
shellfish/fish. Because AMR101 contains ethyl esters of omega-3 fatty acid, patients taking other 
anticoagulants may be at risk to develop a prolonged bleeding time; the risk of active bleeding is 
unknown.
7.1.1Adverse Events List(s)
7.1.1.1Adverse Event List(s) for AMR101
AMR101 is usually well tolerated. According to Micromedex, arthralgia was one of the most 
commonly reported adverse events associated with the use of AMR101 occurring in 2.3% (14/622) 
of patients compared with 1% (3/109) in placebo in pooled data from 2 double-blind clinical trials, 
which included patients with triglyceride values of 200 to 2000 mg/dL. An additional adverse 
effect from clinical studies was oropharyngeal pain. Mild to moderate GI-related adverse events

9.BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES
9.1Biomarker Studies
9.1.1Background
We hypothesize that EPA modulates the gut microbiota to preserve gut immune homeostasis and 
suppress colorectal cancer. The proposed study will assess the influence of EPA treatment on the 
tissue fatty acid composition, the gut microbiome and metabolome, gene expression in colorectal 
cancer tissue, and urinary PGE-M. In doing so, we aim to provide causality for the anticancer 
mechanisms of EPA established by [CONTACT_7714]. We and others have put forth considerable 
efforts to determine measurable biomarkers implicated in the microbial and immune mechanisms 
linking EPA and colorectal cancer. A discussion of these biomarkers and their significance is 
provided below:
9.1.1.1EPA in colorectal tissue
Increasing data suggest that the anticancer effect of EPA relates to its incorporation into the cell 
membrane phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_846877].34,35 High 
intake of EPA results in increased incorporation of EPA and replacement of arachidonic acid 
(AA) in membrane phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. This alteration has two consequences: 1) suppressed 
biosynthesis of AA-derived inflammatory eicosanoids in favor of EPA-derived prostanoids; 2) 
enhanced competition with omega-[ADDRESS_1177606] tumorigenesis.36 Moreover, EPA can 
modify membrane lipid rafts, which are lipi[INVESTIGATOR_846878], cholesterol, and glycerophospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_846879].37 These 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/[ADDRESS_1177607] been associated with enhanced intestinal 
microbiota diversity and EPA-rich diet ameliorates ω-6 PUFAs- or antibiotics-induced 
dysbiosis.26-29 Animal studies indicate that EPA supplements increase the abundance of anti-
inflammatory bacteria, such as lactic acid-producing bacteria (mainly Lactobacillus and 
Bifidobacteria), and decrease the abundance of immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory 
bacteria, such as F. nucleatum, Escherichia coli, and Akkermansia. Likewise, changes in the gut 
microbiota have been linked to CRC, with an enrichment of F. nucleatum, Escherichia coli, and 
Enterobacteriaceae; and a depletion of Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus in CRC patients.46-[ADDRESS_1177608] immunity and CRC

9.1.1.3EPA, microbiota, and stool metabolomics
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/[ADDRESS_1177610] been implicated in 
polyunsaturated fatty acid saturation, a detoxifying mechanism that transforms bacterial growth-
inhibiting polyunsaturated fatty acids into less toxic fatty acids, such as hydroxyl fatty acids.86-92 
These microbial metabolites may help preserve intestinal barrier integrity, reduce oxidative 
stress, and lower inflammation.93,94 Interestingly, Lactobacillus is selectively enriched by [CONTACT_103114] 
(Table 2), suggesting a reciprocal mechanism by [CONTACT_846925]. Moreover, a cross-feeding effect has been 
noted between human Bifidobacterium, which produces lactate and acetate, and the butyrate-
producing species, such as Eubacterium rectale, which convert lactate to butyrate.95-[ADDRESS_1177611] cell metabolites can be shed into the gut lumen, including 
a series of EPA-derived eicosanoids (e.g., PGE 3, lipoxin, leukotriene [LT], thromboxane [TX], 
and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [HETE]) and lipid mediators (including resolvin, protectin, and 
maresin) that possess anti-inflammatory activities and may mediate the anticancer effect of 
EPA.100-105 Of note, some lipid mediators, such as resolvin, may alter the gut microbial 
composition by [CONTACT_846926][INVESTIGATOR_846880], such as intestinal 
alkaline phosphatase (IAP),106 a transmissible factor with lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-detoxifying 
activities.78  Thus, stool metabolomics provides a critical tool to examine the products and 
functionality of the diet – gut microbiota – host interaction. 
9.1.1.4Gene expression profile – immune and inflammatory pathways
Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-[ADDRESS_1177612] 
multifaceted roles in immune regulation.15 High EPA intake has been associated with lower 
circulating inflammatory markers (e.g., TNFα and IL6).109,[ADDRESS_1177613] tissue expression of chemokine C-C 
motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2),[ADDRESS_1177614] of EPA treatment on 
the gene expression profile of colorectal tissue. We hypothesize that EPA treatment reduces the 
gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., TNF, IL6 and CCL2).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinary PGE-M
A mechanism underlying EPA’s immunomodulatory effect may be related to reduced synthesis 
of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) by [CONTACT_337346][INVESTIGATOR_39560]/or tumoral stromal cells.35 PGE 2 
promotes tumor cell survival and is higher in cancer cells than in normal cells.113  PGE 2 
contributes to a shift in the tumor microenvironment from anti-tumor to tumor-permissive.20 
PGE 2 may promote immunosuppression by [CONTACT_846927]3 expression in naïve T cells114-116 
and inducing differentiation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Both 
animal17,18,117,118 and human RCTs14,119 indicate that EPA treatment reduces circulating and 
colonic tissue PGE 2 levels. A clinical trial showed that EPA treatment reduced urinary 
prostaglandin metabolites (PGE-M), a marker of systemic PGE 2 production, by 27.6% compared 
with a 27.9% increase in the placebo group.120 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/[ADDRESS_1177615] meet all eligibility 
requirements and none of the exclusion criteria as outlined in Section 3: Eligibility criteria. 
9.1.2.1Prior to the initial visit
No bowel preparation will be necessary for the procedure since the sigmoidoscope will only be 
advanced to the distal sigmoid colon.
9.1.2.2Initial (baseline) Visit
At the initial visit,  the study physician will obtain written, informed consent for the study as well 
as a standard clinical consent for a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Following OnCore registration, 
participants will be asked to complete with a study coordinator a brief lifestyle questionnaire as 
well as a nutritional survey on a research iPad via VioScreenTM, a validated web-based dietary 
assessment tool developed by [CONTACT_846928], Inc (See appendix for VioScreen security overview, the 
assessed food list, and sample screens).[ADDRESS_1177616] 
will then perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy, advancing to the level of the distal sigmoid colon. No 
more than a total of 24 mucosal biopsies will be taken from the rectum and sigmoid and 
immediately placed in collection tubes. In the MGH GI Unit, we routinely perform endoscopic 
biopsies regardless of concurrent AMR101 use, a practice consistent with recommended 
guidelines.122 A study of the safety of multiple endoscopic biopsies in research subjects from a 
National Institutes of Health series found that performing large numbers of endoscopic biopsies 
(mean number = 38.2 ± 15.6 biopsies per procedure) are “well tolerated and appears to have no 
more than minimal risk without appreciably increasing the risk of otherwise routine endoscopy.”123 
Furthermore, there is no statistically significant association between risk of complications and the 
number of biopsies, type of procedure (flexible sigmoidoscopy vs. colonoscopy), colonic location 
of biopsy, operator, or polypectomy.123 The number of biopsies is also consistent with our existing 
study protocols and has never been associated with any adverse events (See: “Endoscopy Protocol: 
Tissue Specific Immunity Against HIV-1”; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_792570], Ragon Institute). We have estimated that 
24 biopsies will be necessary to complete the proposed analyses. The RNAseq experiments 
proposed require a minimum of 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_846881]. The additional biopsies will be 
required for validation experiments based on the results of genomic and metagenomic analyses 
using targeted sequencing approaches. Due to the small number of cells obtained from pi[INVESTIGATOR_846882], we may use tissue culture techniques to 
expand cell populations. This will allow us to perform these comprehensive analyses without 
additional burden to the participants (i.e. increasing tissue yields by [CONTACT_846929]). 
During flexible sigmoidoscopy, stool will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_846883] a Roth net 
and snap-frozen. . Following the visit, questionnaire data will be transferred to the Partners secure

26REDCap electronic database system. Also, REDCap will be used to store data from the study 
including endoscopy data, medical history information, sample collection, and more.
Participants will be provided with $100 (US) compensation and free parking for up to 4 hours for 
this initial visit.  The final visit will be scheduled with the patient at his or her convenience.
9.1.2.3Final Visit
Participants will return for a second and final visit between 8 and 12 weeks from their initial visit. 
An abbreviated lifestyle questionnaire and a full nutritional survey via VioScreen will be 
administered to update information from the baseline visit. Participants will also provide blood 
and urine samples and undergo a second flexible sigmoidoscopy procedure with mucosal biopsies. 
A bowel preparation will not be necessary for the follow-up flexible sigmoidoscopy. Up to 24 
mucosal biopsies will be taken, as described for the baseline visit. A stool specimen will also be 
collected, as previously described. 
Participants will be provided with an additional $100 (US) compensation and free parking for up 
to 4 hours for this final visit. Total compensation will equal $200 (US) for successful completion 
with the study. 
9.1.3Collection and Processing of Biospecimens
Immediately following each flexible sigmoidoscopy, urine specimens will be aliquoted and 
blood specimens will be centrifuged into plasma and buffy coat. Stool specimens will be stored 
in a cryovial and immediately frozen. Colon biopsies will be immediately frozen for future 
RNA-seq analysis. Yield from these procedures typi[INVESTIGATOR_846884]-seq. 
Thus, any excess colon tissue will be banked for future studies. All aliquots of stool, urine, 
plasma, buffy coat, and tissue will be frozen at -80°C until analysis. We may access FFPE blocks 
of polyps/adenomas removed during the participant’s qualifying colonoscopy with 
accompanying pathology reports to correlate our findings with tissue-specific markers in the 
original adenoma.
Blood samples will be collected in two-6 mL EDTA/purple top tubes at each visit, stored on ice 
until processing and freezing (within 3 hours of collection). Immediately upon receipt, urine 
specimens will be aliquoted into 1.2 mL aliquots and stool samples will be homogenized, 
aliquoted into 100 mg aliquots, and frozen for long-term storage. Fresh tissue will be collected in 
the pathology laboratory immediately following resection, transported on wet ice and 
immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. We may access archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) blocks of any biopsies or tissue specimens collected during the participant’s 
procedures that led to their diagnosis of colon cancer if the diagnostic procedures occurred at 
MGH. If the diagnostic procedures occurred at an external site, formal requests in writing will be 
made to the corresponding pathology department to release and ship tissue to study staff. We will 
request whole tissue blocks or 10-[ADDRESS_1177617]. Chan’s laboratory will supervise all storage of coded specimens. All

11.MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT
This study only uses laboratory-based endpoints to measure the effect of AMR101 treatment. 
There are no clinically observable metrics that will be used as a primary or secondary endpoint or 
primary or secondary effect measure in this study. The primary efficacy endpoint is EPA levels in 
mucosal tissue. A detailed discussion of laboratory endpoints is included in section 9.

13.STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
This study is a single-arm clinical trial that will measure the effects of EPA treatment on specific 
biomarkers related to EPA incorporation, gut microbiota, gut metabolome, and immune response. 
In doing so, we aim to provide causality for the microbial and immune mechanisms that potentially 
mediate the beneficial effect of EPA for colorectal cancer prevention. We and others have put forth 
considerable effort to determine measurable biomarkers implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. 
A comprehensive discussion of these biomarkers and their significance is provided in Section 9. 
We will recruit [ADDRESS_1177629] a single-arm trial of EPA (AMR101, 4 g/day) treatment for 2 months. The 
rationale for selection of this EPA preparation is because it 1) is FDA approved; 2) has good 
comparability across production lots; 3) has been previously used in several trials of EPA.111,132 
The rationale for selection of this dose is because it is 1) the prescription dose approved by [CONTACT_8415]; 
2) consistent with other RCTs of EPA in colorectal neoplasia;13,120,133 and 3) can provide the best 
balance of efficacy and safety. 
13.1Study Design/Endpoints
This study is a single-arm trial of EPA treatment in patients with a history of colorectal adenoma. 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
34The single-arm design is chosen for the following reasons: 1) Based on our prior experience, 
short-term dietary supplementation is unlikely to lead to substantial changes in lifestyle. 2) Any 
major lifestyle changes will be documented by [CONTACT_846933] (pre-intervention) and final (post-
intervention) visits to allow for statistical adjustment in the analysis. Moreover, as described in 
the protocol, we will measure EPA content in red blood cells to further assess compliance and 
changes in omega-3 fatty acid intake. 3) Given the high dose (4 g/day) of highly purified and 
specially formulated omega-3 fatty acid used in the study (AMR101), even modest changes in 
lifestyle is unlikely to introduce significant confounding on the intervention effect of interest. For 
example, one serving (3 oz.) of Atlantic salmon only contains 1-2g of marine omega-[ADDRESS_1177630] 3 servings of salmon per day to achieve the 
intervention dose used in the study. 4) Given the fishy odor and oily appearance of the study 
drug, our MGH Research Pharmacy is unable to provide a visually identical, blinded placebo 
capsule for the study drug. Therefore, given all of these considerations as well as the biomarker-
based nature of the study, we believe that the single-arm design is the best use of the limited 
resources for the study.
The primary aim is to assess the effect of AMR101 treatment on our primary efficacy endpoint, 
mucosal tissue EPA. A detailed discussion of the background of this biomarker is provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Briefly, we will determine the effect of AMR101 at standard dose on mucosal 
tissue EPA content through pre- and post-treatment comparison. The rationale for selection of 
this primary endpoint is to specifically test the effect of EPA on colonic tissue, which will build 
the mechanistic foundation for testing downstream endpoints within the local environment. 
Additional endpoints will include the gut microbiome, metabolome, urinary PGE-M and gene 
expression profile of mucosal tissue. Our study design for each of these endpoints is 
comprehensively discussed in Section 9. Statistical considerations relating to these endpoints are 
provided in the following sections. 
13.2Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration
Patients will be accrued in one stage with no early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. The total sample size is [ADDRESS_1177631] accrual to be 6-7 participants per month and complete the enrollment 
process within one year. This accrual rate is based upon accruals under our recently completed 
IRB-approved protocol (Protocol # 14-496; [CONTACT_299819], PI) for a similar trial of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_846892]. Each patient will be followed for at minimum 8 weeks and at 
maximum 12 weeks. This total sample size accounts for participant drop out, as endoscopy studies 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_341250] a drop-out rate of approximately 10%.
The sample size is based upon the primary efficacy endpoint of M3PUFA supplement at 4 g/d 
increasing mucosal MO3PUFA composition from pre- to post-treatment period by a mean of 3.0%, 
according to previous studies.13,134 The null hypothesis is H 0: Δpost – Δ pre = 0 versus H A: Δpost – Δ pre 
≠ 0, where Δ pre and Δ post are the measurement of mucosal MO3PUFA composition before and after 
the intervention, respectively. Based on prior studies, we assume the standard deviation (SD) of 
9.0% for the paired difference in MO3PUFA measurement. With 80% power and the significance 
level of 0.[ADDRESS_1177632] the mean change 
of 3.0% in MO3PUFA level from pre- to post-treatment period. To account for possible drop out

Our accrual target rates for ethnic and racial minorities will likely be consistent with the rate at 
which we see these minorities in the gastroenterology practice at MGH. (See table on next page)

13.5Analysis of Primary Endpoints
Analysis of mucosal tissue EPA (primary endpoint): Our primary biostatistician, [CONTACT_846951], will 
supervise statistical analyses assessing the change in EPA levels in mucosal tissue after AMR101 
treatment, using a paired t-test. In secondary analyses, we will use mixed linear regression 
models to adjust for duration of treatment and other major factors that may influence the gut 
microbiome, including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34308], antibiotic use, and major dietary and lifestyle patterns (e.g., 
fiber intake, physical activity, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol intake). A robust variance 
estimate will be used to eliminate any normality assumptions for the residuals.
13.6Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Microbiome analysis: [CONTACT_846952] will supervise the gut microbiome analysis. Stool 
specimens collected before and after treatment will undergo metagenomics and 
metatranscriptomics sequencing to assess the influence of EPA intervention on the gut microbial

Protocol Version Date: 12/10/[ADDRESS_1177633]. Huttenhower, a 
leading authority in microbiome data analysis ( http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/biobakery).  
We will associate treatment status with the microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) 
determined by [CONTACT_846934]135 using biomarker discovery tests: LEfSe (Linear Discriminant 
Analysis Effect Size),136 a univariate class comparison method; and MaAsLin (Multivariate 
Analysis by [CONTACT_846935]),[ADDRESS_1177634] been 
previously correlated with an increased risk of colon cancer. 
Analysis of gene expression profiles: [CONTACT_846952] will supervise gene expression analysis. 
Tissues collected after treatment will undergo RNA-sequencing analysis to assess the influence 
of EPA intervention on gene expression profile of colon cancer. Samples are quantified and 
RNA quality is evaluated using Agilent's Bioanalyzer 2100. The percentage of fragments with a 
size greater than 200 nucleotides (DV 200) are calculated; samples with a DV 200 score < 30% are 
included, as the likelihood of success is dramatically reduced. 100ng of RNA is used as the input 
for first strand cDNA synthesis using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) 
and Illumina’s TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit. Synthesis of the second strand of 
cDNA is followed by [CONTACT_846936]. Subsequent PCR amplification enriches for 
adapted fragments. The amplified libraries are quantified using a Qubit assay (Life 
Technologies) and assessed for quality on an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer (DNA 
1000 chip). 200ng of each cDNA library is combined into two 4-plex pools. Illumina’s Coding 
Exome Oligos that target the exome are added and hybridized on a thermacycler. Following 
hybridization, streptavidin beads are used to capture probes that are hybridized. Two wash steps 
effectively remove any non-specifically bound products. These hybridization, capture, and wash 
steps are repeated to assure high specificity. A second round of amplification enriches the 
captured libraries. qPCR is performed on the pooled libraries and normalized to 2nM. The 
normalized, pooled libraries are loaded onto a HiSeq2500 for a target of 50 million 2x76bp 
paired reads per sample. RNA-Seq libraries will be analyzed using Tophat, Cufflinks140 and 
other new statistical packages to identify consistent differences in the end-of-treatment changes 
in transcript levels between tissues before and after EPA treatment at pre-determined FDRs on 
the order of 0.01. Stringent tests for statistically significant differences in RNA levels between 
samples are built into the algorithms for RNA-seq analysis.
Analysis of stool metabolomics: We will use both the non-targeted Global Metabolomics and the 
TrueMass™ Complex Lipid Panel (Metabolon, Inc.) to examine the effect of intervention on the 
stool metabolite profile.  The Global Metabolomics platform quickly and accurately identifies 
and quantitates more than 1,000 metabolites with less than 4.5% median process variability and 
is compatible with almost any sample type. The TrueMass™ Complex Lipid Panel provides 
absolute quantitation of 14 lipid classes, including principle phospholipid, sphingolipid and 
neutral lipid classes. It also provides molecular species concentrations and complete fatty acid
composition of each lipid class, thereby [CONTACT_846937][INVESTIGATOR_33771]. The

visualization and easier interpretation. We will also use the MetaboLync® Client Portal provided 
by [CONTACT_299142], Inc. to perform comprehensive, in-depth analysis, such as the heat map tool, the 
pathway enrichment tool, and the Pathway Visualizations Tool. The treatment effect on 
metabolites (log-transformed whenever needed) will be first assessed by [CONTACT_54959] t-test and then by 
[CONTACT_846938] (pre/post-treatment), duration of 
treatment, and other major factors that may influence the metabolomics, including major dietary 
and lifestyle patterns (e.g., fiber intake, physical activity, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol 
intake).
Analysis of Urinary PGE-M: We will measure PGE-M (11a-hydroxy-9, 15-dioxo-2,3,4,5-
tetranor-prostane 1,20-dioic acid) levels in baseline/pre-treatment and post-treatment urine 
samples using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) as previously described.[ADDRESS_1177635] (custom synthesis). Liquid chromatography (LC) 
will be performed on an Acquity BEH C18 column (2.0 × [ADDRESS_1177636], MA, [LOCATION_003]) connected to a Waters Acquity I-Class UPLC system and 
delivered to a Waters Xevo TQ-S Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters 
Corporation, Milford, MA, [LOCATION_003]).

Protocol Version Date: 12/10/[ADDRESS_1177643]’s dietary behavior in about [ADDRESS_1177644] lists “coffee,” VioScreen prompts to see if 
sugar or milk is added and, if so, what kind of milk.
Subject responses are digitally stored in real time, verified for completeness, and analyzed to 
create an accurate and detailed nutritional profile with over 160 nutrient and food components, 
top foods with key nutrients, current and recommended eating patterns, Body Mass Index and 
Estimated Energy Requirement. Responses and analysis are immediately accessible to the 
researcher via VioScreen’s administrative interface. This straight through process eliminates the 
need for lengthy and costly interviews or error prone paper-based questionnaire processing.
VioScreen’s administrative interface is not just for data access, it makes the management of the 
entire process easy. Researchers are able to define organizations and protocols, assign user roles, 
import subject data, view results and export results to a standard file format for import to 
analytical software.
Hosting Environment & Backup
All data is stored in the latest version of Microsoft SQL Server database. The web server and 
database server reside on their own secure environments separated from other servers through a 
secure router implementation. All server access requires individual user level access via VPN, 
each user is required to update their password after 45 days, and all access is logged and 
reported. The application and database is backed up through highly secure cloud based services. 
The servers are cloud based and each server’s operating system (Windows OS) is updated as new 
patches are released. HIPAA compliance is supported through the use of tools like Idera's SQL 
Server Compliance Manager for auditing sensitive data, monitoring alerts, and potential threat 
detection. Any unauthorized access to any environment or application is reported and tracked 
within the Windows OS.
System & Data Access
VioScreen is web-based application so there is nothing to install or manage. It has interactive 
data input and retrieval over the internet via transport layer security so the only requirement is an 
internet connection and access to www.vioscreen.com. All access to the application is secured 
through encrypted password access and each session is timed out after 15 minutes of inactivity

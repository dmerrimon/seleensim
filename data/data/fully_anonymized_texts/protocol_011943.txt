SPECIFIC AIMS  
Concisely state the objectives of the study and the hypothesis being tested.  
 
The aim of this program to:  
 
1.) Create a remote, or “virtual” diabetes management platform to improve adherence to new guidelines 
regarding use of glucose -lowering medications with cardiovascular and renal benefit for patients with 
type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular and/or renal risk.  
  
2.) Increase patient disease knowledge, activation, and engagement.  
 3.) Evaluate optimal timing of patient education within the program. 
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, 2014    2  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Provide a brief paragraph summarizing prior experience important for understanding the 
proposed study and procedures. 
 
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease when 
compared to patients without diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP1 receptor agonists (GLP1 -
RA) are glucose-lowering medications that have also demon strated improved cardiovascular and renal 
outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease, at high risk for cardiovascular disease, and with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, to date, there has been slow clinical uptake of these medications, even 
in patients at high cardiovascular and renal risk. Utilizing a navigator -driven approach with a 
collaborative practice agreement -based clinical algorithm will allow for a cost -effective and scalable 
approach to medication optimization in patients with diabete s and cardiovascular disease, increased risk 
of cardiovascular disease, and/or CKD.   
A navigator -driven, pharmacist led, remote disease management approach has been shown to be efficient 
and effective in patients who suffer from hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and heart failure (HF) with 
reduced ejection fraction within multiple MGB settings . To date, we have enrolled almost 10,[ADDRESS_231835] 4 years. The goal of the proposed program is to expand to patients with diabetes who are at increased risk of poor clinical outcomes. The overarching goal of these 
progr ams is to partner with and support primary care physicians to help overcome the well -recognized 
therapeutic inertia that often delays adoption of new evidence -based therapy and prevents patients from 
achieving recommended care targets. Our programs utilize collaborative drug therapy management 
(CDTM) agreements, statutory legislation that allows pharmacists to start, titrate, and optimize therapy when using treatment algorithms designed by [CONTACT_13922]. These CDTM agreements are approved by [CONTACT_195335].  
 
In this project, we will use a CDTM agreement to allow a pharmacist, in collaboration with a patient 
navigator, to initiate, discontinue, and titrate SGLT2i, GLP1 -RA, and other diabetes medications based on 
an algorithm developed by [CONTACT_13922].  
 Importantly, medication selection in this program is guided by [CONTACT_195336]-making. In this project, the 
patient will decide whether to start a new medication and which medication to start if there is equipoise 
between medications. Patients are not “assigned” to take a medication in any of the navigator -CDTM 
interventions.  
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Briefly describe study design and anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled 
by [CONTACT_17839] -wide and by [CONTACT_17840].  Provide a brief summary of the 
eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gender, medical condition ).  Include any local site 
restrictions, for example, “Enrollment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s 
protocol is open to both children and adults.”
 
Eligible patients will be identified prospectively utilizing a search paradigm previously described in Phase 
[ADDRESS_231836] (Reference Protocol 2020E000255). Eligible patients will be selected from several 
sources, including the EHR and the Digital Care Transformation (DCT) cohorts, which are groups of 
patients who previously participated or are currently participating in medication titration for management of hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and HF with reduced ejection fraction. These patients will be scr eened 
for eligibility for inclusion in this program.  
 
Inclusion Criteria : Patient is eligible if they meet ALL the following criteria. 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, 2014    3  • Type 2 diabetes currently on, or intolerant to, metformin (treated with diet,  DPP4 inhibitor, 
sulfonylurea, pi[INVESTIGATOR_051], glinides, and/or basal insulin);  
• Age 27-79 years;  
• Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 6.5 -8.9% at the time of screening;  
o Participants whose baseline HbA1c after enrollment is 5.7 -6.4% or 9.0-9.9% will remain 
in the program.  
• At elevated cardiovascular and/or renal risk defined as any atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) ¹, estimated ASCVD risk > 10%, HF, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
<60 mL/min/ 1.73m2, urine albumin -to-creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg/g,  or non -alcoholic 
fatty liver disease, and those aged [ADDRESS_231837] two of: tobacco use, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, or abdominal obesity.  
 
Exclusion Criteria : Patient is ineligible if they meet any ONE of the following criteria. 
• Type 1 diabetes, type 3c diabetes (pancreatogenous), maturity onset diabetes of the young 
(MODY)  
• Currently prescribed an SGLT2i or GLP1 -RA;  
• Currently prescribed basal and bolus  insulin;  
• History of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)  
• History of hypoglycemia²;  
• Frequent hypoglycemia (as defined as >2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_11630] 1 week)², OR  
• Prior liquid or solid organ transplant  
• Limited life expectancy, difficulty managing one’s medications, or any competing medical 
condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_195331] (i.e., active malignancy)  
• Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or without adequate birth control utilization  
• eGFR below 15 ml/min/m2 
• eGFR below 30 ml/min/m2 with a history of pancreatitis  
 
¹ ASCVD for this project is defined as history of myocardial infarction, angina, unstable angina, coronary 
revascularization, percutaneous coronary intervention, transient ischemic attack (TIA) stroke, peripheral 
artery disease, carotid artery disease (>50 % luminal obstruction)  
² Hypoglycemia for this project is defined as a blood sugar < 70 mg/dL  
 Patients recruited into the program will enter either 1) a gradual education period for [ADDRESS_231838] and navigator -based medication titration, or 2) rapid education in conjunction with 
pharmacist and navigator -based medication titration via a Collaborative Drug Therapy Management 
(CDTM) algorithm designed to improve medical therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with 
cardiorenal comorbidities. The CDTM will be approved by [CONTACT_195337]. We will use A/B testing to optimize the timing of the educational program. Outcomes will 
include percentage of patients prescribed SGLT2i or GLP1 -RA, percentage of prescriptions filled, 
HbA1c, change in the diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire short (DTSQs) score, and Patient 
Activation Measure (PAM) at enrollment and completion of the program.  
 
Participants whose HbA1c rises to 9.0 -9.9% following enrollment as part of their program baseline labs 
will automatically be assigned to immediate pharmacist and navigator -based medical titration and rapid 
education. As a result, participants with baseline HbA1c between 9.0 -9.9% will remain in the program but 
will not be part of the A/B testing. 
  
We will generate prototype software to guide DM medication changes based on patient -specific 
information and to longitudinally monitor each participant's progress through the algorithm and document 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, 2014    4  clinical and laboratory information. Basic patient demographic, laboratory, medication, and medical 
history data will be housed in a secure platform database for clinical management and communication.  
Briefly describe study procedures.  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Subjects 
enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study.”  Describe 
study endpoints.
 
Potential participants will be screened for eligibility through CardioCompass –  an application housing 
medical data currently in use at DCT –  as well as the EHR as described in protocol 2020E000255. If 
eligible, the patients will be contact[CONTACT_195338], who will 
ask them whether they would be willing to participate.  
 Participants who agree to participate will enter either early pharmacist and navigator -led medical titration 
and concurrent education, or a gradual titration, through which patients will undergo [ADDRESS_231839] diabetes self -management education curricula, 
focusing on medication adherence, the role and benefit of medical therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and other self -management behaviors. W e will offer written materials of current guideline 
recommendations and an online web portal with short educational videos about diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and lifestyle and medical interventions. Educational videos produced by [CONTACT_195339] ( www.mytonomy.com
) web -based portal. In addition, 
materials from https://knowdiabetesby[CONTACT_135682].org/  – a collaboration between the American Heart 
Association and the American Diabetes Association –  will be shared with patients virtually. We will also 
offer live webinar, question/answer sessions for patients and providers to gain education and ask questio ns regarding the medications and program.  
 
Once each participant has been followed for six months, the intervention will conclude with formal 
written handoff to the patient’s primary care provider (PCP), and the ongoing monitoring of labs, disease 
management, health care utilization, health outcome s, and medications will continue beyond the program 
period as per the patient’s PCP.  
 If an enrolled participant decides that they no longer want to take the medication prescribed within the 
program, they will be asked whether they can be contact[CONTACT_195340] a few questions about 
their current health and the program. This contact [CONTACT_195341].  
 
For studies involving treatment or diagnosis, provide information about standard of care at 
Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from standard care.  
Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedures, or methods of diagnosis.
 
Current standard of care at Mass General Brigham (MGB) includes an individual’s PCP, endocrinologist, 
nephrologist, or cardiologist being aware of the available treatment options, the benefits of the 
medications as demonstrated by [CONTACT_195342], recogni zing the patient’s eligibility for the medication, 
the risks and benefits of utilizing and not utilizing the medication, prescribing the medication, and 
following up laboratory and symptoms to assess for efficacy and further medication titration.  
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, [ADDRESS_231840] from the study, for example, objective criteria for worsening disease/lack of 
improvement and/or unacceptable adverse events.  The inclu sion of objective drop criteria is 
especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups.
 
The program requires that particular prescriptions and titrations be accompanied by [CONTACT_195343]. In parallel with the laboratory draws, navigators will routinely ask participants to 
report potential adverse events. Program pharmacists carry out all prescribing decisions per standardized protocol, and physicians oversee the process and are available for consultation on any patient as needed. 
All dosing information as well as reported medication side effects and/or intolerances will  be entered into 
the EHR. Moreover, all medications in this program are FDA-approved and being used according the 
prescribing instructions and guidelines.  
 
FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects.  Include those 
related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/performed solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and ris ks related to privacy and 
confidentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_17779].
 
All digital health technologies containing participant data will be secure according to MGB standards. 
Patient-identifying data will be accessible only to those assigned to the protocol who require this data to 
ensure patient safety. All health information  is stored on MGB encrypted computers.  
 
EXPECTED BENEFITS  
Describe both the expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the research and the 
importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provide 
a brief, realistic summary of potential benefits to subjects, for example, “It is hoped that the 
treatment will result in a partial reduction in  tumor size in at least 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  
Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being 
studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledge of human physiology or behavior, 
improved safety, or technological advances.  
 
Clinical trials have demonstrated that SGLT2i and GLP1 -RA can improve cardiovascular and renal 
outcomes. The EMPA -REG OUTCOME, DECLARE -TIMI 58, CANVAS, and VERTIS-CV trials 
demonstrated, in aggregate, a reduction in mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, HF events, and renal adverse events for patients with type 2 diabetes and ASCVD and CKD (1, 2, 3, 4). The LEADER, 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, 2014    6  EXSCEL, Harmony Outcomes, and REWIND trials, in aggregate, similarly demonstrated a reduction in 
mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events for patients with type 2 diabetes and ASCVD (5, 6, 7, 
8). With these benefits, the American Diabetes Associat ion (ADA) and European Association for the 
Study of Diabetes (EASD), American College of Cardiology (ACC), and Kidney Disease: Improving 
Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines have recommended these two classes of medication for patients with ASCVD, HF, or CKD  (9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Registries, however, have found low utilization of these 
classes of medications, including in the MGB health system (14, 15).  
 
EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS  
The risks and benefits of the research must be fairly distributed among the populations that stand 
to benefit from it.  No group of persons, for example, men, women, pregnant women, children, 
and minorities, should be categorically excluded from the resear ch without a good scientific or 
ethical reason to do so.  Please provide the basis for concluding that the study population is 
representative of the population that stands to potentially benefit from this research.
 
The study population will be drawn from the EHR and/or the BWH Innovation database of patients, and 
eligible patients will be consecutively contact[CONTACT_195344]. We will focus on 
enrolling patients at high cardiovascular and renal risk (based on the presence of ASCVD, high ASCVD 
risk score, and/or a known diagnosis of HF  or CKD) in whom these medications have FDA indication and 
the support of society guidelines for their use.  
 
When people who do not speak English are excluded from participation in the research, provide 
the scientific rationale for doing so.  Individuals who do not speak English should not be denied 
participation in research simply because it is inconvenient to t ranslate the consent form in 
different languages and to have an interpreter present.
 
Our navigators are fluent in English. For patients who do not speak English, MGB’s interpreter services 
will be used for both the initial enrollment call and all future verbal communications. A written consent 
form will not be used, as detailed in the Cons ent Procedures section.  
 
For guidance, refer to the following Partners policy:  
          Obtaining and Documenting Informed Consent of Subjects who do not Speak English
          https://www.partners.org/Assets/Documents/Medical -Research/Clinical -
Research/Non -English -Speaking -Subjects.pdf  
 
 
 
RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail the specific methodology that will be used to recruit subjects.  Specifically 
address how, when, where and by [CONTACT_94878].  Include any specific recruitment methods used to enhance recruitment of women 
and minorit ies.
 
• The study population will be recruited through both A) an algorithm designed specifically for this 
protocol that identifies eligible patients within the MGB EHR and B) the existing BWH 
Innovation cohort defined earlier.  
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, 2014    7  • Through email or the Epic in -basket, the navigator will notify each potential participant’s PCP of 
their patient’s eligibility and the program details. The PCP can choose to tell the study team not to 
contact [CONTACT_195345]. 
• The navigator will then send a Patient Gateway or email message to the patient informing them of 
the program details, requesting they take a brief Intake Survey, and notifying them that they will contact [CONTACT_195346].  
o Prior to sending program information via an email message, the navigator will first send 
the IRB-approved Email Consent email message.  
• Lastly, the navigator will call the patient. 
 
 
Provide details of remuneration, when applicable.  Even when subjects may derive medical 
benefit from participation, it is often the case that extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], meals at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
parking fees or other inconveniences will result in additional out -of-pocket expenses related to 
study participation.  Investigators may wish to consider providing reimbursement for such 
expenses when funding is available
 
Participants will not be paid or receive any type of remuneration / compensation for their time and 
expenses. Participants will pay for laboratory draws in accordance with their personal health 
insurance plans.

CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_17844], and the timing of consent 
(i.e., how long subjects will be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more 
than minimal risk and all studies involving investigational drugs/devices, a licensed physician 
investigator must obtain informed consent.  When subjects are to be enrolled from among the 
investigators’ own patients, describe how the potential for coercion will be avoided.
 
Potential participants will be notified by [CONTACT_195347] a 
call from a navigator about possible enrollment into the program.  
 
The navigator will review the program details with the participant over the phone. The participant can 
agree to participate during this initial phone call but will also be given the opportunity to ask questions, 
review written materials, and/or separately speak to their PCP prior to enrollment. There is no time 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, [ADDRESS_231841] 200 patients who agree to participate. The patient’s decision to participate or not to participate in this 
program will be documented in the EHR.  The patient will be informed that the decision to participate or 
not will not affect the care they receive from other providers.  
 
As this project is using FDA-approved medications prescribed according to guideline recommendations 
and therefore the primary risk to subjects is no more than minimal and no different from standard of care, 
the study will be conducted with a waiver of consent/authorization.  
 
NOTE: When subjects are unable to give consent due to age (minors) or impaired decision-
making capacity, complete the forms for Research Involving Children as Subjects of Research 
and/or Research Involving Individuals with Impaired Decision- making Capacity , available on 
the New Submissions page on the PHRC website:

DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
Describe the plan for monitoring the data to ensure the safety of subjects.  The plan should 
include a brief description of (1) the safety and/or efficacy data that will be reviewed; (2) the 
planned frequency of review; and (3) who will be responsible for this review and for determining 
whether the research should be altered or stopped.  Include a brief description of any stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_94859], when appropriate.  Depending upon the risk, size and complexity of the 
study, the investigator, an expert g roup, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) or others might be assigned primary responsibility for this monitoring activity.        
 
NOTE: Regardless of data and safety monitoring plans by [CONTACT_17846], the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17782], safety, and welfare of subjects 
under his/her care.  
 
The study team  will review laboratory results and potential adverse event data, as needed, within 3  
weeks of initiation or titration, and for the period the program is responsible for the medication and until 
diabetes care is handed back to his/her PCP. Participants will also be encouraged and asked to report any 
side effects that they experience while in the program. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_195332].  
 
Describe the plan to be followed by [CONTACT_079]/study staff for review of adverse 
events experienced by [CONTACT_17847]/her care, and when applicable, for review of sponsor 
safety reports and DSMB reports.  Describe the plan for reporting  adverse events to the sponsor 
and the Partners’ IRB and, when applicable, for submitting sponsor safety reports and DSMB 
reports to the Partners’ IRBs.  When the investigator is also the sponsor of the IND/IDE, include 
the plan for reporting of adverse events to the FDA and, when applicable, to investigators at 
other sites.   
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October  15, 2014    9   
NOTE: In addition to the adverse event reporting requirements of the sponsor, the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_195333]. For those taking SGLT2i, we expect DKA ~0.2%, 
hypoglycemia ~3%, UTI, and/or mycotic infections at a rate of ~6%  and will prospectively collect and 
monitor clinical data related to this program. We will also review the EHR for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. GLP1 -RA 
are known to cause gastrointestinal side effects in ~20% of users; these are mitigated by [CONTACT_195348]. 
More seri ous AEs such as gallbladder events are rarer and occur at a frequency lower than may be 
observed in a sample of this size. The details of the management protocol, including monitoring for 
safety, will be based on existing guidelines. This will be submitted  separately to the P&T committee. 
HbA1c will be checked at 3 and 6 months after the initiation of therapy per ADA guidelines for usual care 
after diabetes medication change.  
 
MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Describe the plan to be followed by [CONTACT_458]/study staff to monitor and assure 
the validity and integrity of the data and adherence to the IRB -approved protocol.  Specify who 
will be responsible for monitoring, and the planned frequency of monitoring.  For example, 
specify who will review the accuracy and completeness of case report form entries, source 
documents, and informed consent.   
 
NOTE: Regardless of monitoring plans by [CONTACT_17846], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_145478]/her investigative site in 
accordance with the IRB -approved protocol, and applicable regulati ons and requirements of the 
IRB.
 
The study data will be monitored regularly by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_195334], supported by [CONTACT_195349].

confidentiality of data, and storing research records in a secure location.   
 
NOTE: Additional measures, such as obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality, should be 
considered and are strongly encouraged when the research involves the collection of sensitive 
data, such as sexual, criminal or illegal behaviors.
 
All digital health technologies containing participant data will be secure according to MGB standards. Patient-identifying data will be accessible only to those assigned to the protocol who require these data to 
ensure patient safety. All health informatio n is stored on MGB encrypted computers.  
 
SENDING SPECIMENS/DATA TO RESEARCH COLLABORATORS OUTSIDE 
PARTNERS  
Specimens or data collected by [CONTACT_94883], indicate to whom specimens/data will be sent, what information will be sent, 
and whether the specimens/data will contain identifiers that could be used by [CONTACT_94884]/data to individual subjects.
 
Identifiable information will not be shared with persons or entities outside of MGB. Research 
collaborators will be provided with high -level tables that do not include any patient identifiable 
information.  
 
Specifically address whether specimens/data will be stored at collaborating sites outside 
Partners for future use not described in the protocol.  Include whether subjects can withdraw 
their specimens/data, and how they would do so.  When appropriate, submi t documentation of 
IRB approval from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_17787].
 
No specimens or data will be stored at collaborating sites outside of MGB for future use.  
 
Participants can withdraw their participation from the study. However, since the study is done in 
collaboration with patients’ PCPs and all data is entered within the EHR, their data will not be removed.  
RECEIVING SPECIMENS/DATA FROM RESEARCH COLLABORATORS OUTSIDE 
PARTNERS  
When specimens or data collected by [CONTACT_94885], indicate from where the specimens/data will be obtained and whether the 
specimens/data will contain identifiers that could be used by [CONTACT_94886]/data to individual subjects.  When appropriate, submit documentation of IRB 
approval and a copy of the IRB -approved consent form from the institution where the 
specimens/data were collected.
 
Specimens will not be obtained from outside MGB.

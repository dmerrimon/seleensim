Study Design and Methodology:  
This is an open -label, 2 -period, fixed -sequence, single -dose study in 6 healthy adult male 
participant s. 
On Day  1 of Period  1 (ABA Study Period), participant s will receive a single unlabeled oral 
300 mg dose of TAK -935 in tablet form (three 100 mg tablets). At 0. 17 hours ( 10 minutes) 
post oral dosing (ie , 15 minutes prior to the median t max for the oral unlabeled dose 
[~ 0.42 hours or 25 minutes ]), participants will receive a 15- minute IV infusion of a 
microdose of 50 µg (approximately equivalent to ~1  µCi) [14C]TAK -935. Serial blood sampling 
will be perf ormed up to 48 hours (Day  3) to determine the PK of TAK- 935 and M- I 
metabolite (and others , if applicable ) in plasma for the oral dose and [14C]-total radioactivity 
and PK of [14C]TAK -[ADDRESS_24182]  dose to determine [14C]-total radioactivity. Collection of 
urine and fec al samples will continue until one of the release criteria (participants remain in 
the clinical research unit [ CRU ]) is met (ie,  80% or greater of the total dose of radioactivity 
administered is recovered in urine and fecal samples or the excretion of radioactivity in the urine and feces combined has declined to ≤1% of the total administered radioactivity for at 
least 2 consecutive intervals where both a urine and fecal sample are collected) or up to Day 8, but no less than Day 6 , for [
14C]-total radioactivity excretion in urine and feces . 
Participant s who meet release criteria be fore Day 8 will remain confined in the CRU until 
Day - 1 of Period 2 and throughout Period 2 (until Period 2 discharge criteria are met).  
There will be a washout period of at least [ADDRESS_24183] dose in Period 1 and the 
dose in Period  2.

 On Day 1 of Period 2 (ADME Study Period), participants  will receive a single oral dose of 
300 mg (~100  μCi) [14C]TAK -935 in solution. Serial blood sampling will be performed and 
urine and feces will be collected to determine the PK of TAK -935 and M -I metab olite  (and 
others, if applicable)  in plasma and urine, and total radioactivity in plasma, whole blood, 
urine, and feces, and to characterize the metabolite profiles of TAK --935 in plasma, urine, 
and feces. Complete urinary and fecal output will be collected during the confinement period until discharge criteria are met (anticipated to be [ADDRESS_24184]  dose  or less).  
In Period 2, participants will be confined to the CRU for at least [ADDRESS_24185]  dose  (ie, 
120 hours ) and until 90% or greater of the total dose of radioactivity administered is 
recovered in urine and fecal samples. If less than 90% of the total dose of radioactivity 
administered is recovered in urine and fecal samples the participant will continue to stay at 
the CRU until a discharge criterion is met (ie , 90% or greater of the total dose of 
radioactivity administered is recovered in urine and fecal samples or the excretion of 
radioactivity in the urine and feces combined has declined to ≤1% of the total administered 
radioactivity per [ADDRESS_24186] 2  consecutive intervals where both a urine and 
fecal sample are collected ) or up to Day 11  (ie, 240 hours).  
Since up to an approximate [ADDRESS_24187] all participant s (including participant s who terminate the study early) 
30 ± [ADDRESS_24188] study drug administration to determine if any adverse events (AEs) 
have occurred since the last study visit.

 Statistical methods:  
PK Analysis:  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the total radioactivity (whole blood, plasma, urine, 
feces, and if applicable, emesis), plasma and urine TAK -935 concentrations and PK 
parameters, and [14C]TAK935 plasma, urine, and feces radioactivity concentration 
equivalent, using appropriate summary statistics to be fully specified in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).  
ABA of TAK -935 will be estimated u sing a ninety percent (90%) confidence interval (CI) 
constructed for the difference in least squares mean (LSM) on the log scale for dose 
normalized AUC ∞ between a single oral dose and the IV microdose. Exponentiating  the log -
scale 90% CI will provide a 90% CI for the dose -normalized AUC ∞ geometric mean ratio 
(TAK -935 administered as oral dose / [14C]TAK -935 administered as IV microdose). AUC last 
will be analyzed in a similar fashion if AUC ∞ cannot be calculated.  
Mass balance will be calculated as a sum of the percent of the total radioactivity recovered 
in urine and feces plus any radioactivity dose due to emesis (if any occurred) relative to the administered radioactivity dose.  
Safety: 
Safety will be monitored through AEs, 12 -lead ECGs, vital sign measurements, C -SSRS, 
clinical laboratory tests, and physical examination s. AEs will be tabulated and summary 
statistics for the 12 -lead ECGs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests may be computed and 
provided, as deemed  clinically appropriate.  
Sample Size Justification :  The sample size of 6 healthy adult male participants was selected 
without statistical considerations and is deemed adequate to meet the study objectives. In addition, this sample size is limited based on clinical considerations for this type of study and in order to limit exposure to radioactivity.  
Interim Analysis: Not Applicable

4.1. Background 
TAK-935 is a potent and selective cholesterol 24 S hydroxylase (CH24H) inhibitor currently in 
development for adjunct treatment of developm ental and epi[INVESTIGATOR_25280] (DEEs). 
In the brain, cholesterol is metabolized by [CONTACT_25292] 24H, which is specifically and constitutively 
expressed in neurons, to 24 S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC). This  cholesterol metabolite, 24HC, 
leaves the brain via lipoproteins and is excreted  in bile. Aberrant cholesterol metabolism is 
implicated in epi[INVESTIGATOR_25281]. 
TAK-[ADDRESS_24205]-in-class therapeutic candidate that has the potential to control seizures in 
treatment-resistant participants with epi[INVESTIGATOR_25282]-activated glutamate signaling.

The PK, safety, and tolerability of TAK-[ADDRESS_24206] b een evaluated in 4 Phase 1 clinical studies in 
healthy participants and 1 Phase 1b/2 a study in participants with DEE. 
TAK-935 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_25283]-dose (15 to 1350 mg) and multiple-dose 
(100 to 600 mg) oral administration as a soluti on or tablet formulation under fasted conditions 
in healthy participants. TAK-935 plasma concen tration reached maximal levels within median 
0.25 to 0.52 hours following sing le doses. Following multiple do ses (10 or 14 da ys) of TAK-935 
100 mg once daily (QD), 300 mg QD, 300 mg twice daily (BID), 400 mg QD and 600 mg QD 
(without up-titration) as solution under fasted condition, TAK-935 had rapid absorption with 
median t max of 0.33 to 0.5 hour s. Mean TAK-935 t ½z was similar between Day 1 and Day 14, 
ranging from 3.49 to 4.83 hour s. Over the 4-fold dose rang e of 100 to 400 mg QD after 
multiple-dose administration, mean TAK-935 C max and AUC ʏ on Day 14 increased by 6.08 and 
6.12 folds, respectively. Dose s of 100 or 400 mg QD for 14 days did not show apparent 
exposure accumulation on Day 14 when compared  with Day 1, while 300 mg QD for 14 days 
showed about 1.74- and 1.42-fold increase of C max and AUC ʏ on Day 14, respectively. 
Approximately 0.08% to 0.25% of the administer ed TAK-[ADDRESS_24207] of food on the PK of TAK-935 was investigated. Food decreased TAK-935 C max by 60%, 
but had little impact on the total TAK-[ADDRESS_24208] and 
AUCьdecreased by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] 11%. After single oral dose of TAK-935 15 to 1350 mg or multiple oral 
dose of TAK-935 100 to  600 mg, a generally dose-depe ndent decrease in plasma 24HC 
concentrations was observed, with more pr ofound decreases at higher doses. In the CCI

The PK, metabolic pathways, and routes of elimin ation of TAK-[ADDRESS_24210] been evaluated in vitro 
and in vivo in preclinical specie s, being summarized in the IB ( IB Ed 5 ). Further, PK of non-
radiolabeled TAK-[ADDRESS_24211] been evaluated in humans in multiple studies (summarized in the 
IB Ed 5 ). 
The primary purposes of the present study are to characterize the ABA (Period 1) and the 
absorption, metabolism, excr etion, and mass balance of TAK-935 after single oral 
administration (Period 2) in healthy adult male  participants by [CONTACT_25293], urine, and 
feces samples for drug concentration analysis (via radioisotopic quantitation), and plasma, 
whole blood, urine, and fecal samples for total ra dioactivity analysis and metabolic profiling, as 
appropriate. The study will provide data re quired to evaluate the mass balance and the 
metabolic profile of TAK-[ADDRESS_24212] of the 
radioactivity from a [14C]TAK-[ADDRESS_24213] dose in dogs; thus, more than 90% of the radioactivity in humans should be 
eliminated within [ADDRESS_24214] dose.

 6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is an open -label, 2 -period, fixed -sequence, single -dose study in 6 healthy adult male 
participant s. 
On Day  1 of Period  1 (ABA Study Period), participant s will receive a single unlabeled oral 300  mg 
dose of TAK -935 in tablet form (three 100 mg tablets) . At 0.17  hours ( 10 minutes) post oral 
dosing (i e, 15 minutes prior to the median t max for the oral unlabeled dose [~ 0.42  hours or 
25 minutes ]), participant s will receive a 15 -minute IV infusion of a microdose of 50  µg 
(equivalent to ~1  µCi) [14C]TAK -935. Serial blood sampling will be performed up to 48 hours 
(Day 3) to determine the PK of TAK- 935 and M -I metabolite  (and others, if applicable)  in plasma 
for the oral dose and [14C]-total radioactivity and PK of [14C]TAK -[ADDRESS_24215]  dose to determine [14C]-
total radioactivit y. Collection of urine and fecal  samples will continue until one of the release 
criteria ( participant s remain in CRU)  is met (ie,  80% or greater of the total dose of radioactivity 
administered is recovered in urine and fecal samples or the excretion of radioactivity in the urine and feces combined has declined to ≤1% of the total administered radioactivity for  at 
least 2 consecutive intervals where both a urine and fecal sample are collected) or up to Day  8
, 
but no less than Day 6,  for [14C]-total radioactivity excretion in urine and feces. Participant s who 
meet release criteria before Day 8 , but no less than Day 6, will remain confined in the CRU until 
Day - 1 of Period 2 and throughout Period 2 (until Period 2 discharge criteria are met).  
There will be a washout period of at least [ADDRESS_24216] dose in Period 1 and the dose 
in Period  2. 
On Day 1 of Period 2 (ADME Study Period), participants will receive a single oral dose of 300  mg 
(~100 μCi) [14C]TAK -935 in solution . Serial blood sampling will be performed and urine and feces 
will be collected to determine the PK of TAK- 935 and M- I metabolite in plasma and urine, and 
total radioactivity in plasma, whole blood, urine, and feces, and to characterize the metabolite 
profiles of TAK -935 in plasma, urine, and feces. Complete urinary and fecal output will be 
collected during the confinement peri od until discharge criteria are met (anticipated to be 
[ADDRESS_24217]  dose or less).  
In Period 2, participant s will be confined in the CRU for at least [ADDRESS_24218]  dose  (ie, 120 hours) 
and until 90% or greater of the total dose of radioactivity administered is recovered in urine 
and fecal samples. If less than 90% of the total dose of radioactivity administered is recovered in urine and fecal samples, participant s will be confined in the clinic until a discharge criterion is 
met (ie, 90% or greater of the total dose of radioactivity administered is recovered in urine and fecal samples or the excretion of radioactivity in the urine and feces combined has declined to

 6.1.1.  Confinement  
In Period 1, participant s will be confined in the CRU from Day - 1 of Period  1 and throughout 
Period  2. Participant s may be asked to come to CRU earlier in Period 1 to undergo additional 
COVID -19 precaution procedures. All participant s, including participant s who meet one of the 
release criteria (ie, 80% or greater of the total dose of radioactivity administered is recovered in 
urine and fecal samples or the excretion of radioactivity in the urine and feces combined has declined to ≤1% of the total administered radioactivity for at least 2 consecutive intervals 
where both a urine and fecal sample are collected) before Day [ADDRESS_24222]  dose (ie, 120 hours of Period  2) 
and until ≥90% of the total dose of radioactivity administered has been recovered in the urine and feces  samples . 
If less than 90% of the total dose of radioactivity administered is recovered in urine and fecal samples, the participant  will continue to stay at the CRU until a discharge criterion is met. 
Participant s will be eligible for discharge if they meet either one of the following discharge 
criteria or up to Day 11 (ie, 240 hours ) of Period 2:  
 ≥90% of the total dose of radioactivity administered has been recovered in the urine and 
feces; or  
 There is ≤1% of the total administered radioactivity in each of two consecutive 24  hour 
intervals where both a urine and fecal sample is provided.  
All urine and fecal collections will be analyzed for radioactivity levels to determine if the discharge criteria are met.  
It is expected that the majority (≥90%) of the administered radioactivity will be recovered within [ADDRESS_24223]  dose or less. 
Release  of participant s who do not meet a discharge criterion by 240 hours (Period 2) will be 
reviewed on a case -by-case basis.  
Since up to an approximate 24 -hour time lag is anticipated for radioactivity counting of 
samples, actual participant release from the C RU may occur 1  day after discharge criteria are 
met. 
At all times, a participant  may be required to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion of 
the Investigator or designee.

 6.2. Discussion of Design and Control  
In Period 1 of the study, the ABA of TAK- 935 will be estimated using a labeled IV microdose 
infusion administered 0. 17 hours ( 10 minutes) after an unlabeled oral dose in order to  
characterize the disposition properties of TAK -935. In Period 1, characterization of ABA will be 
achieved by [CONTACT_25295], and plasma, urine, and 
fecal samples for total radioactivity analysis following unlabeled oral dose and labelled IV 
microdose of TAK -935. In order to determine ABA accurately and reliably, a healthy adult 
population is chosen.  
Characterization of the disposition of a drug following IV administration facilitates the understanding of fundamental aspects of TAK -935’s PK that cannot be determined from oral 
dosing alone, including bioavailability, intrinsic clearance, and volume of distribution. The results of this study will contribute to a robust understanding of the PK characteristics of 
TAK-935. 
In Period 2 of the study, characterization of the ADME and mass balance of TAK -935 after oral 
administration of a single 300 mg (~100  μCi) [
14C]TAK -935 will be achieved by [CONTACT_25296], and plasma, urine, and  fecal samples for total 
radioactivity analysis and metabolic profiling. The study will provide data required to evaluate 
the mass balance and the metaboli c profile of TAK -935 in humans.

Sponsor for reasons related to participant safety. 
For this study, the collections for blood, urine, and feces for total radioactivity, plasma and 
urine concentrations, and metabolite profiling for TAK-[ADDRESS_24247] time poin t as possible. All other procedures should be 
completed as close to the prescribed/scheduled time as possible but can be performed prior or 
after the prescribed/scheduled time. 
Any nonscheduled procedures required for ur gent evaluation of safety concerns take 
precedence over all routine scheduled procedures. 
9.1. Safety Assessments  
9.1.1. Physical Examination
A full physical examination will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures 
(Appendix 1 ). Each examination will include the fo llowing assessments: general appearance; 
skin; head, ear, eye, nose, and throat; neck; ly mph node; chest; heart; abdominal cavity; limb; 
central nervous system; and musculoskeletal. 
If clinically significant changes from Scre ening/Baseline are noted, the changes will be 
documented as AEs in the AE CRF. Screenin g/Baseline events will be documented in the 
Medical History CRF. Clinical significance is defi ned as any variation in physical findings that has 
medical relevance and may result in an alteration  in medical care. The Investigator will continue 
to monitor the participant until the parameter returns to Baseline or until the Investigator determines that follow-up is no  longer medically necessary.

 Laboratory assessments for safety will be tested at a central laboratory facility. Laboratory reports will be made available to the Investigators in a timely manner for clinical management of participant s. 
It is anticipated that some laboratory values may be outside of the normal value range due to the underlying disease. As in routine practice, the Investigators should use their medical 
judgment when assessing clinical significance. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in 
laboratory measurements which has medical relevance and which results in a change in medical care. If clinically significant laboratory changes from Baseline are noted, the changes will be documented as AEs in the AE CRF. The Investigator will also assess the relationship to s tudy 
treatment for all clinically significant out of range values. The Investigator will continue to monitor the participant  with additional laboratory assessments until (1) values have reached 
normal range and/or Baseline, or (2) in the judgment of the Investigator, out of range values 
are not related to the administration of study drug or other protocol -specific procedures . 
 If participant s experience ALT or AST >3 ×ULN, follow -up laboratory tests (at a minimum, 
serum alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, gamma- glutamyl transferase  (GGT ), and 
INR) should be performed within a maximum of 7 days and preferably within 48 -72 hours after 
the abnormality was noted. (Refer to Section 7.5.2 and Section  9.2.3 for the appropriate 
guidance on reporting abnormal liver function tests.)  
If ALT or AST remains elevated >3 ×ULN on these [ADDRESS_24249] the Medical Monitor for consideration of additional testing, close  monitoring, possible

Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
9.1.7.  12-Lead ECG  
Single 12 -lead ECGs will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures 
(Appendix 1 ). Additional ECGs may be taken at any other times, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_25309].  
ECGs will be performed with participant s in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. All ECG tracings will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_18370].  ECGs will be measured within [ADDRESS_24250] dose, ECGs will be performed 
within approximately 20  minutes of the scheduled time point. 
Study drug should be discontinued immedia tely with appropriate clinical follow -up if a QTcF 
interval >500 ms is detected by [CONTACT_25310] a repeat ECG. Appropriate clinical 
follow -up includes a repeat ECG  (Refer to Section 7.5.2  and Section [IP_ADDRESS] for the appropriate

9.2. Safety Evaluations 
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of participants who have entered this 
study and for alerting Ovid or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the participant. 
The investigator is responsible for the appropriat e medical care of participants during the study. 
The investigator remains responsible for following , through an appropriate health care option, 
AEs that are serious, considered related to the st udy treatment or the study, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue before completing th e study. The participant should be followed until 
the event is resolved or explained. Frequency of follow-up evaluation is left to the discretion of 
the Investigator. 
9.2.1. Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical study participant 
administered a medicinal product and which does  not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable or unintended sign (for example, 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or di sease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether considered related to this medicinal product. 
The definition of an AE also covers medication errors and uses outside wh at is foreseen in the 
protocol only if an AE results from the error, including intentional misuse, abuse, and overdose 
of the product.

Protocol TAK-935-20-001 (OV935)    
[ADDRESS_24251] the occurrence and 
nature of each participant’s pre -existing conditions, including clinically significant signs and 
symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study.  
After the  informed consent form (ICF) is signed, site personnel will record any change in the 
condition(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AEs.  If a participant  experiences an AE after 
signing informed consent, but prior to receiving investigational product, the event will be reported, but will be classified as a pre -treatment AE unless the investigator feels the event 
may have been caused by a protocol procedure.  
In addition, all AEs occurring after the participant  receives the first dose of investigational 
product must be reported to Ovid  or its designee via the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Severity Assessment  
Investigators will be instructed to rate the severity of AEs using the following criteria:  
Mild   Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s 
daily activities.  
Moderate  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concerns with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functio ning. 
Severe  Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Change in severity of an AE should be documented based on specific guidelines in the CRF  
Completion Guidelines.  
Severity and seriousness must be differentiated: severity describes the intensity of an AE, while the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met the criteria for an SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Causality Assessment  
Investigators will be instructed to report to Ovid or its designee their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure and/or study drug via the CRF.  
An Investigator causality assessment (Not Related, Unlikely Related , Possibly Related or 
Related) must be provided fo r all AEs (both serious and non -serious). This assessment must be 
recorded in the CRF and any additional forms as appropriate.  
Relationship of AEs to the defined study treatment, will be determined by [CONTACT_25311]. P lease note that not all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a particular relationship

 Not Related  Exposure to the defined study treatment did not occur, or the occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related in time.   
Unlikely Related  The AE occurred in a reasonable time after the defined study treatment and is doubtfully related to the investigational agent/procedure   
Possibly Related  The defined study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, and the AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_25312], and the AE was more likely explained by [CONTACT_25313], or t he defined study treatment was the most likely 
cause of the AE   
If a participant ’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site 
personnel must clearly report to Ovid or its designee via CRF the circumstances and data 
leading to any such dosage reduction or discontinuation of treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse event collection begins after the participant  has signed informed consent. If a 
participant  experiences an SAE after signing informed consent, but prior to receiving 
investigational product, the event will be reported, but will be classified as a pre -treatment SAE 
unless the investigator feels the event may have been caused by a protocol procedure.  
Planned surgeries and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25287].  
An SAE is any AE from this study that results in one or more of the following outcomes:  
 Results in death  
 Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Is life threatening (that is, immediate risk of dying)  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect

 Page 52 of 78 xOther medically important serious event 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25288], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the part icipant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Serious adverse events occurring up to and includ ing the participant’s last study visit will be 
collected, regardless of the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289]. 
Information on SAEs expected in the study popul ation independent of drug exposure and that 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_25314] ( IB Ed 5 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S [LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the investigator identifies as  related to investigationa l product or procedure. 
[LOCATION_002] 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the 
associated detailed guidance or national regu latory requirements in participating countries 
require the reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs. Ovid has proc edures that will be followed for the recording 
and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with global regulations and the 
associated detailed guidance. 
[IP_ADDRESS].Reporting Adverse Events 
All non-serious AEs must be recorded in the CRF upon awareness.  Any AE that meets SAE criteria ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) must immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) be sent 
to the Sponsor upon learning of any SAE that occu rs (whether or not attributable to the study 
drug). It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that SAE reportin g procedures are followed 
appropriately. All SAE reports and any revisions to  an SAE report must be sent to the following 
email. All supporting source inform ation concerning the SAE (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]) should also 
be provided by [CONTACT_6968].  
Email:   
If there is a question concerning an SAE, the site  needs guidance regarding reporting of an SAE, 
the site is returning a call from the Sponsor’s sa fety specialist, or the site urgently needs to 
report an SAE or make the Sponsor aware of an SAE, the safety hotline should be used.

immediately (ie , within 1 business day) after site personnel first learns about the event in 
addition to emailing the SAE Report form.  
All SAEs must be reported starting from the time that informed consent for study participation 
is provided. If the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE within 30 days after the participant’s 
last dose of study drug or within [ADDRESS_24253] be followed until the event resolves, the event or sequelae stabilize, or it is unlikely that additional information can be obtained after demonstration of due diligence with follow -up efforts (i.e., the participant  or health care practitioner is unable to provide additional 
information, or the participant  is lost to follow up). Serious AEs that occur more than [ADDRESS_24254] dose of study drug need not be reported unless the Investigator considers them 
related to study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sponsor Reporting Requirements  
The Sponsor or its legal representative is responsib le for notifying the relevant regulatory 
authorities of SAEs meeting the reporting criteria. This protocol will use the current IB  as the 
Reference Safety Document. The expectedness and reporting criteria of an SAE will be 
determined by [CONTACT_25315] ( IB Ed 5). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The Investigator must fulfill all local regulatory obligations required for the study Investigators. It is the PI’s responsibility to notify  the IRB or IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site. 
Investigators will also be notified of all S[LOCATION_003]R events that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying its IR B/IEC of these additional SAEs.  
9.2.2.  Exposure During Pregnancy and/or Lactation 
Exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in -utero) can be the result of either 
maternal exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following paternal exposure.  
If a participant’s partner becomes pregnant while treated or exposed to study drug, the investigator must submit a pregnancy form to Ovid  via the same method as SAE reporting. 
Pharmacovigilance will supply the Investigator with a copy of a “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form/Breast Feeding.” When the outcome of the pregnancy becomes known, the form should be completed and returned to Ovid  or Ovid  Pharmacovigilance delegate. If 
additional follow -up is required, the Investigator will be requested to provide the information.

 10. STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSES  
10.1. General Considerations  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will be documented in a SAP. The SAP will be prepared and finalized before database lock. This document will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis 
methodology to address all study objectives. Additional statistical analyse s other than those 
described in this section may be performed if deemed appropriate.  
10.2. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of 6 male healthy participants was selected without statistical considerations 
and is deemed adequate to meet the study objectives. In addition, this sample size is limited based on clinical considerations for this type of study and in order to limit exposure to radioactivity.  
10.3. Analysis Sets 
10.3.1.  Pharmacokinetic Set 
All participants who comply sufficiently with the protocol and display  an evaluable PK profile 
(eg, exposure to treatment, availability of measurements and absence of major protocol 
violations) will be included in the statistical analyses.  
10.3.2.  Safety Set  
All participants who received at least one dose of the study drug will be included in the safety 
evaluations.  
10.4. Demograph ics and Other Baseline Characteristics
 
Continuous demographic data (ie, age, weight, height, and BMI) will be listed and summarized using appropriate summary statistics. Categorical demographic data (ie, sex, race, and ethnicity) will also be listed and tabulated.  
10.5. Participant Disposition  
All participants who discontinue from the study will be identified, and the extent of their 
participation in the study will be reported. If known, a reason for their discontinuation will be given.

 10.6. Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the total radioactivity (whole blood, plasma, urine, feces, and if applicable, emesis), TAK -935 concentrations and PK parameters (plasma and 
urine), and [
14C]TAK -935 pl asma, urine, feces radioactivity concentrations equivalent, using 
appropriate summary statistics to be fully specified in the SAP.  
PK parameters for whole blood and plasma concentrations (as appropriate) and total radioactivity will be calculated as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and for urine and feces, as 
described in Sections 9.3.3 and 9.3.4, respectively.  
ABA of TAK -935 (Period 1) will be estimated using a 90% CI co nstructed for the difference in LS 
mean on the log scale for dose normalized AUC
∞ between a single oral dose and the IV 
microdose. Exponentiating the log -scale 90% CI will provide a 90% CI for the dose normalized 
AUC ∞ geometric mean ratio (TAK -935 administered as oral dose / [14C]TAK -935 administered as 
IV microdose). AUC last will be analyzed in a similar fashion if AUC ∞ cannot be calculated.  
10.6.1.  Analysis of Mass Balance  
In Period 2, mass balance will be calculated as a sum of the percent of the total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces plus any radioactivity dose lost due to emesis (if any occurred) relative to the a dministered radioactivity dose.  
10.6.2.  Whole Blood to Plasma Partitioning Ratio  
In Period 2, ratios of the concentration of [
14C] radioactivity and  TAK-935 in whole blood 
relative to plasma will be estimated (eg,  whole blood:plasma partitioning ratio). The ratio of 
AUC ∞ total radioactivity in blood and plasma will also be calculated.  
10.6.3.  Metabolite Profiling  
In Period 2, TAK -935 metabolite profiling will be performed in plasma, urine, and feces 
containing sufficient amounts of radioactivity. The percent of dose represented by [CONTACT_25318], if any, will be calculated using the radioactivity concentration equivalent data combined with the metabol ite profiling data. The percentage of each identified metabolite, if 
any, to total radioactivity in the plasma will be estimated based on plasma metabolite profiling data.

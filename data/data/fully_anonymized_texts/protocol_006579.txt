Statistical Methodology  We will enroll 84 patients with Ann Arbor score  2 or 3 GVHD which 
provides 80% power to detect a 15% difference in day 28 CR rates (to 
57.5% compared to the historical rate of 42.5%), assuming a Type I error 
rate of 0.05.  
 
Secondary outcomes for efficacy, [e.g., overall response rate (CR+PR), 
the incidence of steroid refractory GVHD, the incidence of severe GI 
GVHD (stage 3 or 4), non- relapse mortality, relapse rates, overall  survival ], 
and for safety [e.g. serious infections and other adverse events] will be 
analyzed using descriptive statistics (cumulative incidence curves, 
Kaplan -Meier, etc. ) and compared to historical control s. Outcomes will be 
analyzed for all patients and separately according to Ann Arbor GVHD score.  
 
Historical controls for this study consists of 256 patients who met the 
criteria for Ann Arbor  score  2 or 3 GVHD (see background and rationale) 
and who were either (1) diagnosed at the University of Michigan or the 
University of Regensburg or (2) participated in the MAGIC consortium 
observational study between 2013- 2017. Approximately 75% of these 
patients were diagnosed and treated since 2010, thus the historical control 
population is comprised primarily of fairly recently transplanted patients . 
 
  
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page [ADDRESS_15751] disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HCT) is the major cause of non- relapse mortality (NRM) and ~25%  of 
patients with GVHD will die from this complication, yet it has been graded and treated in the same way for almost 40 years. The GVHD grading system  [Przepi[INVESTIGATOR_16485] a 1995] uses only 
clinical symptom severity which imposes major limitations. Maximal GVHD grade, which 
includes response to treatment, correlates with NRM; however the grade of acute GVHD 
at diagnosis does not correlate with outcome sufficiently to guide treatment. Thus, treatment is not intensified until primary therapy has failed. This is one reason why the treatment of acute GVHD has not advanced.  
 Although acute GVHD can develop in the skin, liver or gastrointestinal (GI) tract, it is GI 
GVHD that  is the primary driver of NRM. T he vast majority of patients who develop GI 
GVHD that does not respond to high dose systemic steroids, the only effective treatment, will die  [MacMillan 2012].  Unfortunately, the presence of GI GVHD symptoms at diagnosis 
does not predict well for NRM because the majority of these patients are steroid responsive. Patients with GI GVHD at diagnosis treated in the US and [LOCATION_009] (n=894, personal communication, Daniel Weisdorf) experienced NRM of 28%, which was not 
significantly different from patients with an isolated skin GVHD presentation (NRM=25%).  
 Ann Arbor GVHD Scoring 
 
Given the limitations of the current GVHD clinical staging system, we strategized to develop 
a GVHD grading system at onset that possessed the following four key attributes: (1) 
reproducible across different BMT centers and practices, (2) objective, that is, uses biomarkers only, (3) simple, and (4) each score  should crisply define a risk group (low, 
medium, high).  GVHD response to steroids  strongly correlates to NRM. Most clinical trials, 
including this one, use day 28 response rates for the primary endpoint as it is a surrogate 
for GVHD survival  [Levine 2010 , MacMillan 2010, Saliba 2012]. U se of the standard day 
28 response endpoint will facilitate  comparisons with other trials  of GVHD treatment  
reported in the literature. However, analysis of multi -center data has shown that grading of 
clinical GVHD is often inaccurate without the adjudication of expert panels  [Weisdorf 2003] , 
which is impractical during the conduct of a clinical trial. The vast majority (>90% , primarily 
due to steroid refractory GI GVHD) of 6 month NRM is due to GVHD that fails to respond to steroids. We therefore chose to define risk for Ann Arbor scoring according to 6 mont h 
NRM instead of GVHD treatment response because they are closely correlated and because NRM is more objective. Furthermore, steroid refractory GI GVHD alone accounts 
for >80% of [ADDRESS_15752] a 6 month NRM <10%, similar to the 
6% NRM seen in patients transplanted at the University  of Michigan  who do not develop 
acute GVHD. We then conferred with national GVHD experts to recommend the NRM risk that would be sufficiently high to warrant experimental treatments as primary GVHD therapy. The consensus opi[INVESTIGATOR_16486]  3 GVHD should be defined as a 6 month 
NRM ≥40%. We therefore allowed score  [ADDRESS_15753] named 
Ann Arbor GVHD Scoring, we measured the concentrations of five validated biomarkers 
[Paczesny 2009, Paczesny 2010, Ferrara 2011 , Vander Lugt 2013] with the strongest 
individual correlations with NRM (TNFR1, IL2Rα, elafin, REG3α, and ST2) in samples obtained at diagnosis of new onset acute GVHD grades I -IV  in 492 patients from  either 
the University of Michigan or the University of Regensburg, [LOCATION_013] . We randomly divided 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 7 of 44 
 the samples into a training set (328 patients) and an independent validation set (164 
patients). We then used competing risks regression, with relapse after GVHD onset as the 
competing risk, to model 6 month NRM using combinations of the log- transformed absolute 
values of the five biomarkers. A model using three biomarkers (TNFR1, REG3α, and ST2) 
fit the training data well, and the fit was not significantly improved by [CONTACT_16519] (elafin and IL2Rα). Thus, we selected the simplest, three biomarker model, for further development. We then ordered the [ADDRESS_15754] according to their predicted probability  (p̂), of NRM within 6 months of GVHD onset, 
and selected thresholds that stratified patients into NRM risk groups as defined above ( Fig 
1). Notably, there was more than one threshold that met our defined criteria; therefore we 
selected thresholds within the middle of the acceptable range. The 6 month NRM rates 
(score  1, 9%; score  2, 28%; score  3, 47%) were highly statistically different from each other 
(Panel A).  When we applied the Ann Arbor scoring system to the independent validation 
set the results were remarkably similar ( score  1, 9%; score 2, 27%; score  3, 45%) ( Panel 
B). 
 
 
 The gold standard for reproducibility of a grading system is its performance in the multi -
center setting. Therefore, we analyzed samples from 300 patients enrolled in two multicenter trials of primary treatment for acute GVHD conducted by [CONTACT_16520] (0302  
and 0802) [Alousi 2009, Bolanos -Meade 2014]. The eligibility criteria for these studies were 
new onset acute GVHD grades I -IV. Patients were randomized to prednisone 2 mg/kg/d 
(or methylprednisolone IV equivalent) and either etanercept, denileukin diftitox, pentostatin, mycophenolate or placebo. There were no significant differences in complete response rates or survival with any of the treatment arms. Panel C shows that in this 
second independent validation cohort the Ann Arbor scoring system provides reproducible 
6 month NRM rates ( score  1, 5%; score  2, 19% ; score  3, 43%). Importantly, the post -GVHD 
relapse rate of ~14% was evenly distributed across all 3 Ann Arbor GVHD scores  in all 
cohorts, so the overall survival curves closely mirror the NRM curves . Finally, we confirmed 
score

 that Ann Arbor GVHD scores correspond to early treatment response rates, which is 
important for clinical trial design ( Fig 2 ).  
 
 
 
   
 
     
 
     
 
  Ann Arbor score [ADDRESS_15755] diagnosed. For example, the NRM of Ann Arbor high risk 
GVHD is 45%. The vast majority of these deaths (85%) are from steroid resistant GI 
GVHD, even though 50% of high risk patients do not have clinical GI symptoms at diagnosis.  This clinical trial will use the day [ADDRESS_15756] an increase from the 30% CR rate (in red, Fig 2 ) to 45%  [Levine 2015] . 
 
1.2 Revised Ann Arbor Scoring Algorithm (April 2017)  
 A biomarker algorithm that uses only two biomarkers (ST2 and REG3α) to predict lethal GVHD on day 7 after BMT was developed and validated in a large multicenter study population of 1287 patients [Hartwell 2017]. The two biomarker algorithm was then shown to accurately predict outcomes at diagnosis of acute GVHD as well as at other time points post-BMT (such as one week after the initiation of steroid treatment for GVHD) [Major -
Monfried 2016]. The two biomarker algorithm has been adapted to produce identical scores to the original Ann Arbor scoring algorithm and replaces the three biomarker algorithm previously used for eligibility for this trial  
 
1.3 Rationale for Inclusion of Ann Arbor 2 GVHD ( August 2018)  
Outcomes for patients with Ann Arbor 3 GVHD are dismal, with a 45% non- relapse 
mortality rate within 6 months of diagnosis. Outcomes for  patients with Ann Arbor 2 GVHD  
are also poor with unacceptably high rates of treatment failure (49%) and NRM (27%) as 
shown in Figures [ADDRESS_15757] not improved 
recently by [CONTACT_16521] 120 MAGIC  patients with Ann Arbor 2 GVHD since 
2015. The six month NRM rate in these patients remains stubbornly high at 24%. Patients 
with Ann Arbor [ADDRESS_15758] screened 229 patients with newly diagnosed GVHD . The 
proportion of patients with Ann Arbor 3 GVHD is somewhat lower than expected (13%

Page 9 of 44 
 compared to an expected 20%). Ann Arbor 2 GVHD comprises 21% of all patients 
screened. While an intervention that improves outcomes for  Ann Arbor 3 GVHD would 
represent a significant advance in the field, an effective intervention for all patients with high risk GVHD (Ann Arbor  2 and 3) is highly desirable . We have therefore redesigned the 
statistical plan (section 11) such that we can retain the knowledge gained from the patients with Ann Arbor 3 GVHD already enrolled on this trial and expand the eligibility to patients 
with An n Arbor 2 GVHD. The expanded eligibility will shorten the time to complete 
enrollment by 50%.  
1.4 Study Agent(s) Background and Associated Known Toxicities  
GI GVHD requires T cells to home to the intestinal mucosa [ Snider and Liang 2001] . Thus 
it is unsurprising that blocking T cell trafficking to the intestine abrogates GVHD mortality in animal models. This can be accomplished by [CONTACT_16522] [Choi 
2007 ] or the integrin- ligand interactions  [Murai 2003 , Waldman 2006 , Ueha 2007] that are 
necessary for T cells to migrate into the intestinal mucosa. The α4β7- MAdCAM -1 (mucosal 
vascu lar addressin) interaction is key in this regard.  
 The mechanism of action of the monoclonal antibody natalizumab makes it an attractive agent to study for patients at high risk for steroid refractory GI GVHD. Natalizumab binds to the α4 component of the α4β7 integrin and thus inhibits T -cell mediated damage to the 
GI tract [ Yu 2013] . Multiple studies have shown natalizumab to be an effective treatment 
for active, treatment resistant, Crohn’s disease, in which the intestinal tissues are injured, 
similar to GVHD for >10 years [Gordon 2001, Ghosh 2003, Sandborn 2005, Targan 2007, 
Kane 2012, Juillerat 2013, Sakuraba 2013]. The most important of these studies was the 
ENCORE trial which randomized 509 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease to receive  natalizumab 300 mg or placebo intravenously at weeks 0, 4, and 8. The 
primary endpoint was induction of response. Additional efficacy endpoints included the proportion of patients with sustained remission and response or remission over time. Response at Week 8 sustained through Week 12 occurred in 48% of natalizumab- treated 
patients and 32% of patients receiving placebo (P < .001). Sustained remission occurred in 26% of natalizumab- treated patients and 16% of patients receiving placebo (P = .002). 
Week 4 response rates were 51% for natalizumab and 37% for placebo (P = .001). 
Responses remained significantly higher at subsequent assessments (P < .001) in natalizumab- treated patients. Natalizumab- treated patients also had significantly higher 
remission  rates at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 (P < or = .009). The frequency and types of adverse 
events were similar between treatment groups [Targan 2007]. Natal izumab was FDA -
approved in 2008  for use in for the treatment of moderate- to-severe Crohn's disease in 
patients with evidence of inflammation who have had an inadequate response to, or are 
unable to tolerate, conventional Crohn's disease therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 
A recent meta- analysis included 5 randomize d clinical trials of 1,771 patients who received 
natalizumab or placebo in order to induce remission in active Crohn’s disease. Failure to achieve remission occurred in 810 (65.4%) of 1,238 patients receiving natalizumab at 2 to 
12 weeks, compared with 412 (77.3%) of 533 randomized to placebo. The RR of not achieving remission was reduced with natalizumab (0.88; 95% CI 0.83– 0.94, I
2=0%, 
P=0.72), with no statistically significant funnel plot asymmetry (Egger test, P=0.29)  [Ford

The safety profile of natalizumab has been extensively evaluated with ~100,000 patients 
treated since FDA approval in 2004 for multiple sclerosis and in 2008 for Crohn’s disease. 
Progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML) is a serious but rare complication that has 
been reported in patients treated with natalizumab for either conditi on.  Risk factors include 
concomitant immunosuppression and seropositivity for JC virus but long duration of treatment (>2 years) is the primary risk factor. It is reassuring that the incidence of PML in patients treated with natalizumab for fewer than 12 months was 4/100,000 [Bloomgren 
2012 ].  The risk of PML in patients treated with immunosuppression is 2/1000  [Biogen

1.5 Safety Data for Natalizumab Generated in this S tudy  (August 2018)  
To date, no toxicities observed on this study have been attributed as probably or definitely 
related to natalizumab. There have been no serious cardiac, pulmonary or liver toxicities. One patient developed renal failure seven months after completion of study treatment in the context of severe chronic GVHD and failure to thrive . This complication was considered 
unrelated to natalizumab.  
 Infections have been carefully monitored on this study. Enrollment to this  trial was paused 
once a predetermined threshold of serious infections was observed in order t o allow for 
analysis and safety assessment. The analysis concluded that natalizumab was not contributing to the incidence of serious infections.  
 Fifteen serious infections were observed in 12 patients  (out of 32 study subjects)  which 
include bacterial (n=9), fungal (n=3) and viral (n=3). The most common i nfection was  
bacterial sepsis with an enteric organism (Klebsiella, n=5, E coli, n=2; E. faecium, n=1). In 7/8 cases , the bacterial sepsis developed in the context of steroid- refractory stage 4 GI 
GVHD, a setting in which the intestinal architecture is extensively damaged and bacterial translocation is a well -known complication. One case of Klebsiella sepsis that developed 
on study day 8 in a patient responding to the combination of high dose steroids and 
natalizumab and was considered possibly related to natalizumab. The median time to develop a serious bacterial infection  was study day 25 (range 2- 85 days).  The majority of 
these infections developed after additional immunosuppression had been given for lack of response to GVHD treatment. One presumed aspi[INVESTIGATOR_16487] [ADDRESS_15760] dose of natalizumab 
(one case each of EBV PTLD and HHV6 encephalitis) . Both of these cases were 
considered unrelated to natalizumab. One case of CMV colitis that developed on study day 
[ADDRESS_15761],  the timing 
relative to nata lizumab infusions and the occurrence often after initiation of additional 
immunosuppression led investigators to attribute these 13/15 infections to causes other 
than natalizumab. This assessment is consistent with a recent report that GI GVHD treated 
with steroids is the major risk factor for bacterial and fungal sepsis after allogeneic BMT  
[Mori 2018]. The two infections  that were considered  possibly related to do not significantly 
alter the risk -benefit ratio for this study.

 1.6 Other Agents  
Prednisone (or methylprednisolone) will be co -administered with natalizumab. Systemic 
corticosteroid therapy has been the standard treatment for acute GVHD for 40 years and 
its efficacy and risks are well understood [Martin 2012]. Detailed information on adverse 
events and potential risks are detailed in section 9.0.  
1.7 Rationale  
The newly developed Ann Arbor GVHD scoring system risk -stratifies patients at diagnosis.  
Patients with Ann Arbor score 3 GVHD represent a high risk strata enriched for the 
development of steroid refractory GI GVHD and early death. The six month NRM for patients with Ann Arbor score 3 GVHD is 1.6 times that of those with GI GVHD at diagnosis 
(45% vs. 28%). Early identification of patients at high risk for steroid refractory GI GVHD is important as early treatment is more likely to be effective. Furthermore, the low complete response rates (30%) and high NRM rates in patients with Ann Arbor score [ADDRESS_15762] and has shown exceptional efficacy in Crohn’s disease with response rates 16% higher than placebo after a single dose. The administration of an agent that inhibits T -cell 
trafficking to the GI tract to patients with Ann Arbor score [ADDRESS_15763] not yet done so, is an attractive approac h to a highly lethal disease.  
 
The clinical response on day 28 of treatment correlates with long term survival in patients 
with GVHD [Levine 2010, MacMillan 2010]. Therefore, we chose the day 28 CR rate as the trial’s primary endpoint. Because we expect improvements in day 28 CR to translate into better long- term outcomes, 1 year NRM and 1 year survival will be secondary endpoints. 
Additional secondary endpoints related to efficacy will include the day 28 overall response 
rate (CR + PR), the proportion of patients who develop treatment -refractory GVHD (defined 
as those who do not achieve CR or PR by [CONTACT_4475] 28 or who receive additional 
immunosuppression prior to day 28), time to discontinuation of steroid therapy, number of 
lines of GVHD therapy, and cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD. Secondary endpoints 
related to safety include [ADDRESS_15764] previously shown that GI pathologic grade [Ferrara 2011] and more 
recently, that Paneth cell numbers from GI biopsies correlate with GI GVHD outcomes [Levine 2013].  However, major gaps exist in our understanding of how pathologic changes 
correlate with clinical outcomes  such as treatment response and NRM.  While not mandated 
as part of study participation, endoscopic evaluations with biopsies are routinely performed in patients with suspected GVHD and GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.). 
When consent is provided, w e will analyze small and large bowel biopsy samples obtained 
from these patients using immunohistochemical staining for cells and proteins with known associations with GI GVHD including Paneth cells, intestinal stem cells, RORγt+ NKp46+ 
cells pr oducing IL- 22, regulatory T cells, α4β7T -cells, and cellular expression of toll -like 
receptors, NOD -like receptors, α -defensins, and Reg3α.  
 
Furthermore, a recent publication showed that repeating endoscopic evaluations in patients with persistent GI symptoms is helpful [Martinez 2012] . In that retros pective study, 
histological findings of repeat endoscopic biopsies led to a change in clinical management 
in 77% of the cases, such as altering the intensity of immunosuppression and/or adding 
specific treatment for a coexisting infectious disease. From the 84 study patients with Ann Arbor score 2 or 3 GVHD, we estimate that onset biopsies will be available for 90% of the 
42 patients with GI symptoms at onset, or 38 patients. We further estimate that 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 12 of 44 
 approximately 40% of these patients, or 15, will undergo repeat endoscopic evaluation at 
day 28 for persistent GI symptoms.  
 
Serial se rum biomarkers. GVHD biomarkers measured during treatment correlate with 
clinical outcomes such as treatment response and survival [Levine 2008, Levine 2012 ].  
For example, a biomarker panel on day [ADDRESS_15765] likely to experience a GVHD flare [Levine 2012 ]. Therefore, we expect  that GVHD 
biomarker concentrations during treatment measure GVHD alloreactivity independently of 
clinical symptoms. We will collect and store serum samples  during treatment for these 
future analyses  from consenting patients .

3.2.[ADDRESS_15770] 
patients will be recruited from centers participating in the Mount Sinai  Acute GVHD International 
Consortium (MAGIC) and will already have consented prior to transplant for clinical data and 
research blood sample submission to the Ferrara Lab a t pre- specified time points post -BMT  as well 
as at the onset of acute GVHD. Thus, written informed consent for the pre-screening process to 
determine eligibility will already have been obtained at each center on a separate, IRB -approved 
protocol.  Patients who initially were not offered or declined to participate in the MAGIC study who 
consent at the time of onset of acute GVHD can provide the pre- screening research sample needed 
for Ann Arbor scoring. Because the vast majority of patients consent at time of transplant to the 
sample collection protocols, this latter option will be infrequently utilized.  
 
The pre- screening process is outlined in the figure below. Pre-screening takes place entirely under 
the previously provided informed consent detailed above. The process is explained here for 
completeness. Five m L of serum will be collected from patients with new onset acute GVHD on the 
day of diagnosis of GVHD (preferable) or up to [ADDRESS_15771] be initiated within 3 days after the start of steroid 
treatment for GVHD.  Exceptions to this timeline can be made on a case- by-case basis with 
Sponsor -Investigator approval. Once a sample has been collected, it will be (1) registered in the 
remote data entry system using the unique natalizumab  identification number  assigned to the 
patient at time of registration in the database and (2) shipped priority overnight to the laboratory of 
[CONTACT_16550] for early AM arr ival (see MAGIC Sample Collection and Storage manual  for 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_4585] ). Samples can be received Tuesday through Saturday.  Once received in 
the laboratory, the GVHD biomarkers used to assign the Ann Arbor GVHD score will be measured 
by [CONTACT_16525] ( see Appendix A for details ). Processing, 
measuring, and confirming the ELISA assay results take 4.5 hours (range 4- 6 hours). Once the 
Ann Arbor score  is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ferrara (or [CONTACT_16551] in [CONTACT_16552]’s absence), the 
investigator at the participating center will be notified of the Ann Arbor score  by [CONTACT_16526]. Only patients with confirmed Ann Arbor score  [ADDRESS_15772] be complete 
by [CONTACT_2671] 3 day  window;  therefore investigators are encouraged to begin the informed 
consent process at the same time as the pre- screening research serum sample is obtained . 
Patients who sign informed consent but are not eligible to participate because they do not have 
Ann Arbor score 2 or 3 GVHD  will be considered screen failures as  well as  any patient who does 
not meet  all the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 Patient registration for this trial will be centrally managed by [CONTACT_16527]:  
 
A potential study subject who has been screened for the trial and who has signed the Informed 
Consent document will be initially documented by [CONTACT_16528]  (DCC).  
 
It is the responsibility of the local site investigator to confirm  patient  eligibility for the clinical trial. 
Confirmation of Ann Arbor score [ADDRESS_15773]. Levine or designee. All other eligibility criteria 
will be provided by [CONTACT_16529].  After patient eligibility has been determined, a copy of the 
completed  Eligibility form will be submitted by [CONTACT_16530] [EMAIL_281]  with local site investigator signature [CONTACT_16549] .  
 The MAGIC Coordinator, who acts as the registrar, will review the submitted documents and 
process the registration. Sites should inform the MAGIC  Coordinator of a potential registration once 
a research sample has been submitted for Ann Arbor score assignment given the time sensitivities 
in this study.    
 An email will be sent by [CONTACT_16531]. 

________________________________________________________________________ 
Page [ADDRESS_15774] start within  3 days of initiation of systemic steroid  treatment 
for acute GVHD . For example, a patient diagnosed with acute GVHD  who starts systemic 
steroid treatment  on Monday (day 0), who has a research sample shipped to the Ferrara 
Lab on Tuesday (day 1), will have their Ann Arbor score  assigned on Wednesday (day 2). 
Such a patient should  begin study treatment no later than Thursday (day 3).  Exceptions 
to this time line can be made on a case- by-case basis with Sponsor -Investigator approval.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_15775] of two drugs : Prednisone (or methylprednisolone) 
which is standard treatment for acute GVHD and natalizumab, the drug under 
study.  
5.1.2  Corticosteroid dosing and taper  
All patients enrolled on this trial will receive steroids at a dose of prednisone 2 mg/kg/day orally (or IV methylprednisolone) . Centers may use a starting dose of 2 
mg/kg of methylprednisolone if that is their institutional practice.  The dose of steroids cannot be tapered before study day 2  (day [ADDRESS_15776] dose of natalizumab), but  afterwards local institutional tapering practices can 
be followed.  Steroid therapy can also be given up to [ADDRESS_15777] dose 
of natalizumab (day -3 to -1), i.e., during the period from the initiation of systemic 
steroid treatment for  acute GVHD until study therapy begins . 
 The following is a suggested steroid taper (identical to that used in Blood and 
Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network primary GVHD therapy studies):  
 
2 mg/kg/day of steroid  divided once or twice/day days 1 -6 
1.5 mg/kg/day once daily days 7 -13 
1 mg/kg/day once daily days 14 -21 
0.5 mg/kg/day once daily days 22 -28 
Patients should be tapered as tolerated to no less than 0.5 mg/kg/day.  
Then taper according to institutional guidelines with a goal to reach ≤0.2 mg/per/kg per day of prednisone or ≤0.16 mg/per/kg per day of methylprednisolone by [CONTACT_4475] 56.

basis with Sponsor -Investigator approval.  
 Natalizumab will be administered at a dose of  300 mg intravenously on days 0 and 
14. If, for reasons other than toxicity, the second dose cannot be administered on 
day 14, the acceptable window for administration is day 1 2-16. 
5.1.4  GVHD Prophylaxis Medications  
Medications such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus,  sirolimus (if used as GVHD 
prophylaxis when acute GVHD developed) should be continued at therapeutic doses (according to institutional standards) adjusted as necessary for renal, central nervous system (CNS) or other toxicity using conventional management  
guidelines.   
 
5.1.5  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_16490] -absorbable steroids for GI 
GVHD are  allowed.  
Ancillary/supportive care measures for acute GVHD such as the use of anti- motility 
agents for diarrhea, including octreotide, is allowed at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  Use of ursodiol to prevent/reduce gall bladder sludging, or prevent 
hepatic transplant complications is also allowed according to institutional guidelines  
5.1.6  Supportive Care Guidel ines 
In addition to prescribed study drug plus corticosteroids, all patients should receive the following:  
 
• Transfusion support per institutional practice  
• Anti-infective prophylaxis against herpes virus is required but otherwise 
institutional practice can be followed.  
• Anti-infective prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci , bacterial and 
fungal infections according to standard institutional guidelines.  
• Pre-emptive monitoring and treatment for CMV  and EBV  infections are 
required but otherwise institutional practice can be followed.  
5.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity . Each 
patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the Time and Events 
Table ( Section 6.4) . Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology  
Crite ria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dose adjustments should be made 
according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity .  
 The dose of natalizumab will not be modified on this study for toxicities or co- morbidities 
that develop between the first and second dose. In the event that a toxicity develops that 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 19 of 44 
 the treating physician deems  poses an unacceptable risk to administering natalizumab, the 
dose should not be given and the patient will be removed from study therapy.  
 
The second dose of natalizumab should be administered on day 14 of the study. However, if for reasons other than toxicity the second dose cannot be administered on day 14, the acceptable window is day 1 2-16. 
5.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
Concomitant use of other investigational agents is not permitted during the treatment phase 
of the study.

5.5 Infection Prophylaxis (August 2017)  
This trial originally expected a 24% incidence of severe infections (BMT CTN grade 3) 
based on an expected distribution of enrollment of 25% grade 1 (mild skin) GVHD, 50% grade II (moderate skin and or mild GI) and 25% grade III/IV (primarily severe GI) GVHD. However, this trial has disproportionately enrolled patients with severe GVHD grade III/IV 
(12/20, 60%). Patients with severe GI GVHD have considerable damage to the GI mucosa 
and are at increased risk of translocation of enteric bacteria from the GI lumen into the bloodstream and sepsis. As a result, the incidence of BMT CTN grade [ADDRESS_15780] 20 patients enrolled on this trial (45%) significantly exceeded the expected 24% rate, because more patients at high risk for this complication enrolled than expected. To reduce 
the risk of this complication, the study DSMC required the protocol include mandatory gram 
negative antibiotic coverage (fluoroquinolone or institutional preference) from study day 0 
to study day 42, which encompasses this high risk period. Antibiotic prophylaxis can be continued beyond day 42 per institutional preference.  
5.6 Duration of Therapy  
The duration of protocol therapy on this study is 14 days (two doses of natalizumab 
administered on day 0 and 14). Protocol therapy will end after the second dose of 
natalizumab has been administered or if any of the following criteria apply:  
 
• Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Patient voluntarily withdraws from treatment OR 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investig ator

Evaluable for response: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity  and response from 
the time of their first treatment with natalizumab. 
 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 24 of 44 
 Complete Response (CR): All evaluable organs (skin, liver, GI tract) stage 0.  For 
a response to be scored as CR on day 28, the patient must be in CR on that day 
and have had no intervening addition al GVHD therapy.  
 
Partial Response (PR): An improvement in one or more organ involved with GVHD 
symptoms without worsening in others. For a response to be scored as PR on day 
28, the patient must be in PR on that day and have had no intervening additional GVHD therapy.  
 
No response (NR): All responses that are not CR or PR. Patients who receive any 
GVHD therapy other than steroid therapy, natalizumab, non-absorbable oral 
steroid therapy, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_16493] 28 regardless of 
organ staging.   
7.1.2  Proportion of CR and CR+PR  
Scoring of CR and PR on day 28 are in comparison to the patient’s acute GVHD staging on day 0 of the study.  
7.1.3  Treatment refractory GVHD  
Patients who are scored as no response on day 28 or who receive additional 
immunosuppression prior to day 28 (i.e., no response) will be considered treatment refractory.  
7.1.4  Steroid discontinuation  
The date of discontinuation of steroid therapy will be recorded.  
7.1.5  Lines of GVHD therapy  
Any new acute GVHD therapy will be considered a line of therapy.  Resumption or 
changes in GVHD prophylaxis are not considered new lines of therapy.  
7.1.6  Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM)  
Any death that occurs after onset of GVHD not attributable to relapse of the underlying disease will be considered a non- relapse death.  
7.1.7  Chronic GVHD  
The occurrence of chronic GVHD, including date of diagnosis, will be recorded.  
7.1.8  Relapse  
Relapse, including date of relapse,  of the underlying malignancy will be recorded.  
7.2 SAFETY/TOXICITY DEFINITIONS  
7.2.1  Known or plausible toxicities that may be related to natalizumab will reported. 
Guidance of determining whether a toxicity is an adverse event attributable to natalizumab is provided in section 8.  
7.2.2  Hepatotoxicity  
Elevated hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST) and/or total bilirubin > 1.5 times the baseline 
values on day 0 or higher than the upper limit of normal, whichever is higher, will 
be considered evidence of hepatoxicity.  
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 25 of 44 
 7.2.3  Hematologic abnormalities

8.1.[ADDRESS_15796] had a hypersensitivity reaction to natalizumab 
8.1.2  Special Warnings and Precautions for Use  
• Herpes encephalitis and meningitis: Life- threatening and fatal cases have 
occurred.  
• Hepatotoxicity: Significant liver injury, including liver failure requiring transplant, 
has occurred.  
• Hypersensitivity reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) have occurred.  
• Immunosuppression/Infections: Natalizumab may increase the risk for certain 
infections.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_15797] serious adverse reactions with natalizumab are:  
• Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)  
• Hypersensitivity  
• Immunosuppression/Infections  
 The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 10%) were headache and fatigue in both multiple sclerosis (MS) and Crohn’s disease (CD) studies. Other common adverse reactions (inc idence ≥ 10%) in the MS population were 
arthralgia, urinary tract infection, lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], gastroenteritis, vaginitis, depression, pain in extremity, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea NOS, and rash. Other common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 10%) in the CD population were upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_16495].  
 The most frequently reported adverse reactions resulting in clinical intervention 
(i.e., discontinuation of natalizumab), in the MS studies were urticaria (1%) and 
other hy persensitivity reactions (1%), and in the CD studies were the exacerbation 
of Crohn’s disease (4.2%) and acute hypersensitivity reactions (1.5%).  
 
Infections  
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) occurred in three patients who received natalizumab in clinical trials. Two cases of PML were observed in the [ADDRESS_15798] case occurred after eight doses in one of the 1043 patients with Crohn’s disease who were evaluated for PML. In the post marketing setting, additional 
cases of PML have been reported in natalizumab- treated multiple sclerosis and 
Crohn’s disease patients who were not receiving concomitant immunomodulatory therapy.  
 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page [ADDRESS_15799] infections. In one multiple sclerosis study, the incidence of serious infection was approximately 3% in both natalizumab- treated patients 
and placebo- treated patients. Most patients did not interrupt treat ment with 
natalizumab during infections. The only opportunistic infection in the multiple  
sclerosis clinical trials was a case of cryptosporidial gastroenteritis with a 
prolonged course.  
 
In Crohn’s disease studies, the rate of any type of infection was 1.[ADDRESS_15800] infection,  and influenza. The majority of patients did not interrupt natalizumab 
therapy during infections and recovery occurred with appropriate treatment. Concurrent use of natalizumab in CD clinical trials with chronic steroids and/or methotrexate, 6- MP, and azat hioprine did not result in an increase in overall 
infections compared to natalizumab alone; however, the concomitant use of such agents could lead to an increased risk of serious infections.  
 
In two CD studies , the incidence of serious infection was approximately 2.1% in 
both natalizumab- treated patients and placebo- treated patients. In a third CD 
study , the incidence of serious  infection was approximately 3.3% in natalizumab-
treated patients and approximately 2.8% in placebo- treated patients.  In clinical 
studies for CD, opportunistic infections ( Pneumocystis carinii  pneumonia, 
pulmonary  Mycobacterium  avium intracellulare, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, 
and Burkholderia cepacia) have been observed in <1% of natalizumab- treated 
patients; some of these patients were receiving concurrent immunosuppressants.  
Two serious nonbacterial  meningitides occurred in natalizumab- treated patients 
compared to none in placebo treated patients.  
 
Infusion- related Reactions  
An infusion- related reaction was defined in clinical trials as any adverse event 
occurring within two hours of the start of an infusion.  Observe subjects for one hour 
after end of infusion.  In MS clinical trials, approximately 24% of natalizumab-
treated multiple sclerosis patients experienced an infusi on-related reaction, 
compared to 18% of placebo- treated patients. In the controlled CD clinical trials, 
infusion- related reactions occurred in approximately 11% of patients treated with 
natalizumab compared to 7% of placebo- treated patients. Reactions more 
common in the natalizumab- treated MS patients compared to the placebo- treated 
MS patients included headache, dizziness, fatigue, urticaria, pruritus, and rigors.  
 Acute urticaria was observed in approximately 2% of patients. Other 
hypersensitivity reactions were observed in 1% of patients receiving natalizumab. Serious systemic hypersensitivity infusion reactions occurred in <1% of patients. All patients recovered with treatment and/or discontinuation of the infusion.  
 Infusion- related reactions more common in CD patients receiving natalizumab 
than those receiving placebo included headache, nausea, urticaria, pruritus, and flushing. Serious infusion reactions occurred in CD studies at an incidence of <1% in natalizumab- treated patients.  
 MS and CD patients who became persistently positive for antibodies to natalizumab were more likely to have an infusion- related reaction than those who 
were antibody -negative.

 8.2 Adverse Event  Reporting Requirements  
Adverse event  (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial  and is 
done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll 
in future studies using similar agents . Data on adverse events will be collected from the 
time of the initial study treatment (day 0) through  [ADDRESS_15801] also be reported. Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) will  continue to be followed until : 
• Resolution or the symptoms or signs that constitute the serious adverse event 
return to baseline;  
• There is satisfactory explanation other than the study  treatment for the changes 
observed; or  
• Death.  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation, grading and assignment of attribution of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions of AEs and SAEs are given below . It is the responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16496].  
Any medical condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before initial study 
treatment administration is considered to be pre- existing in nature. Any known pre-existing 
conditions that are ongoing at time of study entry should be considered medical history.  
All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE (CTCAE grade 3 or higher) or SAE, 
as defined in Section 8.3,  occurring from the initial study treatment administration through 
[ADDRESS_15802] be 
recorded as an adverse event in the patient’s source documents and on the CRF 
regardless of frequency, or  assessed relationship to the study treatment.  
In addition to new events, any increase in the frequency or severity ( i.e., toxicity grade) of 
a pre- existing condition that occurs after the patient begins study treatment is also 
considered an adverse event  and must be reported if the severity is CTCAE grade 3 or 
higher . 
8.3 Definitions  
8.3.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  
 
• Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive (i.e. , surgical) 
procedures will not be reported as adverse events . However, the medical 
condition for which the procedure was performed must be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event unless it is a pr e-existing (prior to protocol 
treatment) condition.  
 
• Event reporting for GVHD treatment protocols can be complicated and confusing for investigators, data managers, and regulatory oversight bodies because patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_16497]. Furthermore, transplant -
related complications often occur both simultaneously and in series, as one 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 29 of 44 
 complication leads to a series of downstream events. Therefore, a well -
conceived event reporting plan separates background transplant and GVHD 
noise as might be seen with any transplant where GVHD develops from study 
related events that are relevant to patient safety. On this study , we will not 
report CTCAE grade 1 and 2 adverse events (which make up the majority of events) unless the investigator determines the event should be reported to protect subject safety.  
 
• Symptoms of the original or targeted disease are not to be considered adverse events for this study. The following symptoms are indicative of the underlying 
disease, GVHD, and will not be reported as adverse events (unless the event 
is considered serious  or deemed by [CONTACT_2418] a natalizumab 
infusion reaction):  
 
• Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia  
• Skin rash 
• Fever  
 
• Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy.  They are to be captured 
under the signs, symptoms or diagnoses associated with them.  
8.3.2  Serious Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator , it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
  
o Death  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be reported as event (SAE) itself.  
 
o A life -threatening adverse event  
An adverse event  is considered ‘life- threatening’ if, in the view of either the 
investigator, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
 
o Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] > [ADDRESS_15803] normal life functions  
 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
o Important medical event  
Any event that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition of “Serious Adverse Event”. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home; convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16498].  
 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 30 of 44 
 Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries should 
not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened 
during the course of  the study. Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16499]’s medical history at 
the time of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16500] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (for example, for the administration of study therapy or other protocol -required procedure) should 
not be considered SAEs. However, if the preexisting condition worsened during 
the course of the study, it should be reported as an SAE.  
 
8.3.3  Expected Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if:  
• For approved and marketed drugs or devices, those adverse events  are 
described in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
• For investigational new drugs or devices, those adverse events are 
described in the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.  
• In clinical research studies, information on expected adverse events is 
also summarized in the protocol and in the consent document.  See 
section 9.[ADDRESS_15804] of expected adverse events  related to the drug under 
study.  
8.3.4  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “unexpected” if it is not described in the Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in published medical literature, in the protocol, or in the informed consent document.  
8.4 Adverse Event  Characteristics  
8.4.1  CTCAE T erm 
(AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4. [ADDRESS_15805] access to a 
copy of the CTCAE  version  4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4. 0 can be down 
loaded from the CTEP web site. (http://ctep.cancer.gov
) 
8.4.2  Attribution of the AE  
The investigator or co- investigator is responsible for assignment of attribution.  
Definite  – The AE is clearly related  to the study  treatment.  
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
Unrelated  – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment .

or possible to study treatment administration) to the local IRB as per local IRB 
policy .  
8.5.4  All Serious Adverse Events whether expected or unexpected and possibly related  
(definite, probable or possible) to study treatment administration will be reported using the Serious Adverse Event form within [ADDRESS_15810] awareness of the event to the MAGIC Data Coordinating Center . A copy of the form should be sent to the 
MAGIC Coordinator via email to 
[EMAIL_281] . 
 
The MAGIC Data Coordinating Center  will disseminate information regarding 
serious adverse events to the participating sites within 5 days of review of the 
information by [CONTACT_6283]. Ferrara or Levine only in the case that the event(s) is believed to be related (i.e. probably, or definitely)  to the study medication. All other Serious 
Adverse Events will be discussed on monthly webinars held with all participating 
centers (see section 12).  
 
The Sponsor Investigator  will be responsible for reporting of events to the FDA and 
supporters, as appro priate  and defined in the regulations under 21 CFR 312.32.   
8.6 Routine Reporting
 
All other adverse events  that are not SAEs as defined in section 8.3—such as those that 
are expected, or are unlikely or definitely not related to the study participation—are to be 
reported annually as part of regular data submission and as per the local IRB policies .

Page 32 of 44 
 8.7 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems  
Upon becoming aware of any incident, experience, or outcome (not related to an adverse 
event) that may represent an unanticipated  problem  involving risks to subjects or others , 
the investigator should assess whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem . The incident, experience or outcomes are considered unanticipated 
if it meets all of the following criteria:  
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency);  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized.  
If the investigator determines that the incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem, the investigator must report it to the MAGIC Data Coordinating 
Center  within [ADDRESS_15811] treatment 
and 6 month non- relapse mortality (32% in AA2 and AA3 patients combined) experienced 
by [CONTACT_16535]. 
 The following risks were considered in the development of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. P rogressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a serious , potential ly lethal  complication and is listed as 
a black box warning on the prescribing information brochure for natalizumab. Other serious infections, including herpes encephalitis and meningitis, have been reported with 
natalizumab. Patients with GVHD and on immunosuppression are already at increased risk 
for development of serious infections. The degree to which natalizumab may further increase that risk is unknown. Therefore we will follow the below  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16501].  
 
STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16502] #1: PML  
The clinical study will be stopped if one case of PML develops. Notification from the site to 
the Sponsor Investigator must occur within 24 hours  of event .  A webinar will be scheduled 
within 3 days of Sponsor knowledge for the participating sites to discuss the case.  In the 
event of one case, the informed consent will be revised to inform potential subjects  that a 
case of PML was observed  on this clinical trial. The trial will only be re- opened to accrual 
with approval by [CONTACT_16536] (TCI)  DSMC , the external advisory board,  and 
the FDA after review of all safety data available and after any additional safety measures 
are implemented. If a second case of PML develops, the study will be closed to accrual and no further doses of natalizumab will be administered to any patient currently undergoing treatment.  
 
STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16502] #2: EXCESS NON -RELAPSE MORTALITY  
Although we do not expect natalizumab to increase the incidence of fatal infections or 
contribute to increased mortality, for safety reasons we will continuously monitor the incidence of non- relapse mortality throughout the study. If natalizumab adversely affects 
the risk of non- relapse mortality we expect that effect to manifest itself during the early 
follow -up period after administration of the drug.  
 We will continuously monitor non- relapse mortality occurring within 100 days of study 
administration. If the incidence of NRM occurring within 100 days of study administration is greater than the associated boundary value b
k listed in the table below, among the k 
patients enrolled in the trial, then accrual will be halted for safety considerations.  We 
________________________________________________________________________

An enrollment rule to prevent an excessive number of toxicities as described in Song and Ivanova will be used to inform us of the number of additional patients we can recruit when the current patient has not yet completed follow -up[Song and Ivanova 2015]. Formally, the 
trial can enroll  m new patients such that  r + x + m ≤b
n+m + M, r + x + m– 1 < bn+m−1 + M, 
and n + m ≤ K where r  is defined as the number of patients that have not completed follow -
up and are still being followed for toxicity;  x is the number of patients that have experienced 
toxicity n is the total number of patients enrolled to date and M is the fixed design 
parameter. To be able to complete the study in a timely manner, we allow M to be 26.

• Mode of action: Natalizumab binds to the α4- subunit of α4β1 and α4β7 integrins 
expressed on the surface of all leukocytes except neutrophils, and inhibits the α4-
mediated adhesion of leukocytes to their counter -receptor(s).  
 
• Pharmacokinetics: In patients with CD, following the repeat intravenous administration of a 300 mg dose of natalizumab, the mean ± SD maximum observed serum 
concentration was 101 ± 34 mcg/mL. The mean ± SD average steady -state trough 
concentration was 10 ± 9 mcg/mL. The estimated time to steady -state was 
approximately 16 to 24 weeks after every four weeks of dosing. The mean ± SD half -
life, volume of distribution, and clearance of natalizumab were 10 ± 7 days, 5.2 ± 2.8 
L, and 22 ± 22 mL/hour, respectively. The effects of total body weight, age, gender, 
race, selected hematology and serum chemistry measures, co- administered 
medications (infliximab, immunosuppressants, or steroids), and the presence of anti -
natalizumab antibodies were investigated in a population pharmacokinetic analysis 
(n=1156). The presence of anti -natalizumab antibodies was observed to increase 
nataliz umab clearance. Pharmacokinetics of natalizumab in patients with renal or 
hepatic insufficiency have not been studied.  
 
• Side effects: See section 8.1 of this document for complete listing of adverse effects.  
 
• Drug Interactions: Natalizumab interacts with immunosuppressant agents and increases the risk of infection.  
 
• Storage and stability: TYSABRI single- use vials must be refrigerated between 2 to 8°C 
(36° to 46°F). Do not use beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_16507]. DO NOT SHAKE OR FREEZE. Protect from light. Natalizumab must be stored in a secure, limited access area.   
 
• Preparation and Dispensing:  
 1. Use aseptic technique when preparing natalizumab solution for intravenous infusion. Each vial is intended for single use only.  
2. Natalizumab is a colorless, clear to slightly opalescent concentrate.  Inspect the 
natalizumab vial for particulate material and discoloration prior to dilution and 
administration. If visible particulates are observed and/or the liquid in the vial is 
discolored, the vial must not be used.  
3. To prepare the solution, withdraw [ADDRESS_15813] the concentrate into 100 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. No other IV diluents may be used to prepare the natalizumab solution.  
4. Gently invert the natalizumab solution to mix completely. Do not shake. Inspect the solution visually for particulate material prior to administration.  
5. The final dosage solution has a concentration of 2.6 mg/mL.  
6. Following dilution, infuse natalizumab solution immediately, or refrigerat e solution 
at 2 to 8°C, and use within 8 hours. If stored at 2 to 8°C, allow the solution to warm to room temperature prior to infusion. DO NOT FREEZE.

• Administration:  
1. Infuse natalizumab 300 mg in 100 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, over 
approxim ately one hour (infusion rate approximately 5 mg per minute). Do not 
administer natalizumab as an intravenous push or bolus injection. After the infusion is complete, flush with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  
2. Observe patients during the infusion and for one hour after the infusion is complete. Promptly discontinue the infusion upon the first observation of any signs 
or symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity -type reaction  
3. Use of filtration devices during administration has not been evaluated. Other 
medications should not be injected into infusion set side ports or mixed with natalizumab.  
 
• Availability : Provided by [CONTACT_16537] , Inc. 
• Return and Retention of Study Drug:  
Any remaining/expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]/used is to be destroyed on site according to the institution standard operating procedure for drug destruction and documented on the drug accountability logs.  
 
• Drug Accountability:  
The principal investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093], must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of the investigational drug, natalizumab. The drug accountability records will capture drug receipt, drug dispensing, drug return and final disposition.   
9.2 CORTICOSTEROIDS (Prednisone and Methylprednisolone)  
Glucocorticoids produce widespread and diverse physiologic effects on carbohydrate, 
protein, and lipid metabolism, electrolyte and water balance, functions of the cardiovascular system, kidney, skeletal muscle, and the nervous systems. Glucocorticoids reduce the concentration of thymus - dependent lymphocytes (T -lymphocytes), monocytes, and 
eosinophils. Glucocorticoids selectively bind to the cortisol receptors on human lymphoid cells. They also decrease binding of immunoglobulin to cell surface receptors and inhibit 
the synthesis and/or release of interleukins, thereby [CONTACT_16538] T -lymphocyte 
blastogenesis and reducing expansion of the primary immune response. The specific 
cellular mechanisms that act to halt DNA synthesis are thought to be related to inhibition of glucose transport or phosphorylation, retardation of mitosis, and inhibition of protein synthesis.

10.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL STUDIES  
The goal of the planned laboratory correlative studies is to improve our understanding of the 
biological processes that drive GVHD and its clinical outcomes.  
 
10.1 Sample Collection Guidelines  
The correlative sample collection schedule is detailed in section 6.4 above. Serum will be 
collected in no additive, silicone coated glass  or plastic  tubes  containing no anticoagulant 
(red or gold top tube). Samples will be processed at the participating center and batch 
shipped to Ferrara Laboratory quarterly for storage. Sample processing details are found in Appendix A. Instructions for quarterly batch shippi[INVESTIGATOR_16508]. 
10.[ADDRESS_15814] of care purposes, provided that this tissue is 
no longer needed for further clinical use. These biopsies will be requested and batch 
shipped after  the tissue is no longer needed for further clinical use (minimum six months 
from biopsy acquisition) . 
 
Drs. Ferrara  and Levine will be responsible for reviewing and approving requests for clinical 
specimen from potential research collaborators from within the MAGIC consortium.  
 
The specimens, DNA, and their derivatives may have significant therapeutic or commercial 
value . The Informed Consent form contains this information and informs the subject that 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page [ADDRESS_15815]'s medical record may be provided to research collaborators when specimens are made available:   
• Diagnosis  
• Collection time in relation to study treatment  
• Clinical o utcome – if available  
• Demographic data  
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is a phase II open label multicenter clinical trial. The primary study endpoint is day [ADDRESS_15816] improvements in day 28 CR to translate into better l ong-term 
outcomes, secondary endpoints include 1 year NRM and 1 year survival.  Additional 
secondary endpoints related to efficacy will include the day 28 overall response rate (CR 
+ PR), the proportion of patients who develop treatment -refractory GVHD (defined as not 
CR/PR by [CONTACT_4475] 28 of treatment or who receive additional immunosuppression prior to day 28), time to discontinuation of steroid therapy, number of lines of GVHD therapy, and cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD. Secondary endpoints related to safety include [ADDRESS_15817] developed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16509]. A single case of PML will cause suspension of study enrollment until (1) a safety review has been conducted and (2) the informed consent is modified to include that a case of PML developed on this study. A second case of PML will cause the study to terminate.  
 .  Because we are changing the design of the study and enrolling another cohort in addition 
to the patients currently enrolled, the planned interim analysis will not be applicable. We 
therefore calculated the conditional power, i.e., the probability that the study r esults will 
be statistically significant given the data observed thus far. We have so far enrolled [ADDRESS_15818] sufficient follow -up for the primary endpoint  
assessment  (28 day response). We observed 12 CRs, 6 PRs and 10 NR s. Given  these 
data, the conditional power of the study based on the previous design ([ADDRESS_15819] the null 
hypothesis) is 0.[ADDRESS_15820].  Therefore, our conditional power 
analysis indicates that the new study design is sufficiently powered.  
 
 The historical controls for this study consists of  256 patients who met the criteria for Ann 
Arbor score  2 (n=142) or  3 (n=114)  GVHD and who were either (1) diagnosed at the 
University of Michigan or the University of Regensburg or (2) participated in the MAGIC consortium observational study between 2013- 2017. Approximately 75% of these patients 
were diagnosed and treated since 2010, thus the historical control population is comprised primarily of fairly recently transplanted patients.  
11.[ADDRESS_15821] fixed the 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 38 of 44 
 numbers of patients with Ann Arbor 2 and Ann Arbor 3 GVHD to provide a final study ratio 
of 1:1. This allows us to weight the two GVHD scores equally for the calculation of the 
predicted magnitude of improvement and the accompanying power and sample size.  eWe 
maintained a conservative estimate of 15% for the magnitude of improvement in weighted 
day 28 CR (from 42.5% to 57.5%), similar to the 14% effect size seen within 4 weeks (i.e. 
after one dose of natalizumab) in active Crohn’s disease. We chose our sample size based 
on both feasibility and power requirements.  A sample size of 84 (42 AA2 and 42 AA3 
patients) will provide 80% power to detect a 15% difference in CR rates, with a Type I error rate of 0.05. Finally , we have re- estimated the historical day [ADDRESS_15822] up-
to-date data available  (256 patients transplanted up until 7/2017) . 
 
11.3 Data Analyses Plans  
The primary endpoint is day 28 CR rate. Death, lack of CR at day 28, or initiation of 
additional immunosuppressive therapy will be considered failures for this endpoint. The day 28 CR rate in the study patients will be compared to the historical control rate of 42.5%.  
 
Secondary outcomes such as the overall response rate (CR+PR), the incidence of steroid refractory GVHD, the incidence of severe GI GVHD (stage 3 or 4), non- relapse mortality, 
relapse rates, overall survival, will be analyzed using descriptive statistics (c umulative 
incidence curves, Kaplan- Meier, etc. ) and compared to historical controls.  Outcomes will 
be analyzed for all patients and separately according to Ann Arbor GVHD score.  
  
12.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
The safety of subjects is paramount and supersedes all other concerns. This study will employ 
several layers of oversight to ensure that patient safety is protected.  These layers (described in 
more detail further below) are:  
 
1. The local Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at each site which will be responsible for monthly reviews of patient data at each site  
2. The Protocol Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), composed of the individual site 
PI’s which will review all facets of study conduct at all sites on monthly webinars  
3. The External Advisory Board (see below for membership), which is composed of national 
experts in BMT and GVHD who will be responsible to (1) review and advise on the interim analysis when performed and (2) recommend whether the study can reopen whenever a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16510] (see section 8.8). A meeting of the EAB will be scheduled in a timely fashion as needed in order to accomplish these review functions and subsequently these 
recommendations will be provided to the TCI DSMC  and to each IRB.  
4. The Tisch Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee ( TCI DSM C) of the Mount 
Sinai Health System  is the DSMB of record for this study. The DSMB  will be compliant with the 
NIH approved DSMP Charter. This  committee will be responsible for monitoring the safety and 
data integrity of the trial. It is a DSMB entirely composed of members with no connection to this 
clinical trial. The DSMB will have final authority on interpreting the interim analysis and whether 
the study can reopen whenever a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16511].  
5. The IRBs at each participating site and the Mount  Sinai Health System.  
6. The FDA which will receive safety reporting as required by [CONTACT_16539] (21 CFR 312.3).  
 Thus, the investigators conducting the trial will review the trial conduct at their own site as well as 
each other’s sites on a monthly basis, thereby [CONTACT_1541] a high level of attention to any safety 
concerns that may develop. Additionally, authority is v ested in three independent bodies (the 
External Advisory Board, the TCI DSMC, and the IRBs) to monitor, and if safety concerns warrant, 
close the clinical trial. Lastly, this trial will be conducted in a manner compliant with the Federal regulations pertaining to clinical trials conducted under an IND.  
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 39 of 44 
  
Local DSMC: Each participating site is required to have its own Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) for the study.  This committee will be composed of the local site principal 
investigator, site co-i nvestigator(s), site data manager or study coordinator and other members of 
the study staff involved in the conduct of the trial.   
 During the committee’s monthly  meeting, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16512]:  
 
 Enrollment rate relative to expectations, characteristics of participants  
 Safety of study participants (Serious Adverse Event & Adverse Event reporting)  
 Adherence to protocol (protocol deviations)  
 Completeness, validity and integrity of study data  
 Retention of study participant s 
 These meetings are to be documented by [CONTACT_16540] (DSMR), signed by [CONTACT_16541] .  Each site is required to submit the completed DSMR to the MAGIC Coordinator at  the 
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  on a monthly basis together with other pertinent 
documents.  
 
Similarly, protocol deviations are to be documented using the Notice of Protocol Deviation Form 
and requires the signatures of both the site ’s data manager or study coordinator and the site 
principal investigator. These reports are to be sent to the MAGIC Coordinator at the Icahn School 
of Medicine at Mount Sinai  within 7 calendar days of awareness of the event and on a monthly  
basis with the Protocol Specific Data and Safety Monitoring Report.  
 
Protocol DSMB: The centers participating in this study are collaborating centers in MAGIC ( Mount 
Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium) which has been holding monthly webinars to review 
GVHD clinical data from each of these sites  since January 2013. The local site principal 
investigator, data manager, and study coordinator participates in these monthly webinars.  While 
this study is open, in addition to the local DSMC meetings, the monthly MAGIC webinars will provide 
an additional forum for discussion of the above matters, which will keep all participating centers 
current on all data and safety issues that arise, thereby [CONTACT_16542].  
 The MAGIC Data Coordinating Center  is responsible for collating all the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Reports from all the participating sites, and providing the information to the TCI Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee. 
 
External Advisory Board:  The scientific  advisory board is composed of national experts in BMT 
and GVHD. The members are Chair -; Joseph Antin, MD, Chief, Adult Oncology Hematopoietic 
Stem Cell Transplantation Program, Dana- Farber Cancer Institute, Nelson Chao, MD, Chief, 
Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy/BMT , Duke Cancer Institute and 
Steven Burakoff, MD, Dean for Cancer Innovation at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai . 
 TCI DSMC: The TCI DSMC  serves as the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) for investigator 
initiated studies conducted under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_16513] (TCI) at the Mount 
Sinai Health System . It is compliant with the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer 
Institute charter for DSMBs. This board will be responsible for monitoring the safety and data 
integrity of the trial. It is a DSMB entirely composed of members with no connection to this clinical trial. 
 
12.1 Multisite Clinical Monitoring Procedure s 
This clinical study will be coordinated by [CONTACT_16543] (DCC) of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. As such it will be conducted in accordance 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 40 of 44 
 with the ethical principles that are consistent with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and in 
compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements.  
 This study will be monitored by a representative of the  MAGIC Data Coordinating Center . 
Monitoring visits will be made during the conduct of the study and at study close- out. 
 Prior to subject recruitment, a participating site will undergo site initiation meeting to be conducted by [CONTACT_15791]. This will be done as an act ual site visit , teleconference, 
videoconference, or web- based meeting after the site has been given access to the study 
database and assembled a study reference binder.  The site’s principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16514]. Study -
related questions or issues identified during the site initiation meeting will be followed- up 
by [CONTACT_16544].  
 
Monitoring of this study will include both ‘Centralized Monitoring’, the review of source 
documents at the DCC and ‘On -site Monitoring’, an actual site visit.  The first ‘Centralized’ 
visit will occur after the first subject enrolled completes treatment (i.e., two doses of 
natalizumab) .  The study site will send the de- identified source documents to the DCC for 
monitoring.  ‘Centralized’ monitoring may be requested by [CONTACT_16545]. The site will send in pertinent de- identified 
source documents, as defined by [CONTACT_16546].  
 
The first annual ‘On- site’ monitoring visit should occur after the first five study participants 
are enrolled or twelve months after a study opens, whichever occurs first.  The annual visit may be conducted as a ‘Centralized’ visit if less than three subjects have enrolled at the 
study site.  The type of visit is at the discretion of the DCC.  At a minimum, a routine 
monitoring visit will be done at least once a year, or once during the course of the study  if 
the study duration is less than 12 months. The purpose of these visits is to verify:  
 
 Adherence to the protocol  
 Completeness and accuracy of study data and samples collected  
 Proper storage, dispensing and inventory of study medication  
 Compliance with r egulations  
 During a monitoring visit to a site, access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16515].  While most 
patient cases will be selected from patients accrued since the previous monitoring visit, 
any patient case has the potential for review.  At least one or more unannounced cases will be reviewed, if the total accruals warrant selection of unannounced cases.  
 The MAGIC Data Coordinating Center ( DCC) expects the relevant investigational staff to 
be available to facilitate the conduct of the visit, that source documents are available at the time of the visit, and that a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related 
documents. Any issues identified during these visits will be communicated to the site and are expected to be resolved by [CONTACT_16547] a timely manner.  For review of study -related 
documents at the DCC, the site will be required to ship or fax documents to be reviewed.   
 
Participating site will also undergo a site close- out upon completion, termination or 
cancellation of a study to ensure fulfillment of study obligations during the conduct of the 
study, and that the site Investigator is aware of his/her ongoing responsibilit ies. In general, 
a site close- out is conducted during a site visit; however, site close- out can occur without 
a site visit if all of the following apply:  
 
 No patient has signed the Informed Consent Form and has enrolled into the study  
 Investigational agent  has not been dispensed  
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 41 of 44 
  All investigational agent and materials have been returned as defined for the study 
or destroyed and accounted for properly.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_15823] a ‘for cause’ audit of the trial if the board identifies a need for a more rigorous evaluation of study -related issues. A “for cause” audit would be 
conducted by [CONTACT_16548] g Center . 
 A regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) may also wish to conduct an inspection of the study, during its 
conduct or even after its completion. If an inspection has been requested by a regulatory 
authority, the site investigator must immediately inform the MAGIC Data Coordinating Center  that 
such a request has been made.

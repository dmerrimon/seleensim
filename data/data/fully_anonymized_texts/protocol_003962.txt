This document  is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted in accordance with US 
government research regulations, and applicable international standards of Good Clinical Practice, and 
institutional research policies and procedures.
1.1 Background
In addition  to significant morbidity from RA morbidity, the risk of myocardial infarction is increased nearly 2-
fold in the setting of RA.(Meune et al., 2010; Solomon et al., 2006) Rheumatoid arthritis induced activation of 
systemic inflammatory pathways and endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in this increased risk.(Sattar 
et al., 2003) Inflammation mediates many aspects of disease pathogenesis in atherosclerosis, involving 
diverse cell types and mediating signals.(Hansson, 2005) Platelets have been implicated in atherosclerosis 
because of their pro-inflammatory and thrombogenic effects.(Gawaz et al., 2005) Moreover, pathological and 
clinical studies demonstrated the importance of platelet activity in cardiovascular events.  It is likely that 
increased platelet reactivity in patients with RA contributes to the increased risk of myocardial infarction and 
also contributes to the joint inflammation as well. 
1.[ADDRESS_1173536],that is approved for the treatment of 
patients with acute coronary syndrome and prior myocardial infarction.  In addition to its antiplatelet effects, 
ticagrelor can inhibit adenosine cell uptake, likely through inhibition of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 
1. Ticagrelor also significantly increases coronary blood flow velocity via an adenosine mediated mechanism.
1.3 Preclinical  Data
Methotrexate (MTX)  is the anchor drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) although many patients 
will not achieve a complete response to MTX alone. (Weinblatt, 2013) In general, the onset of action of MTX 
is delayed (onset by 2-3 months) although generally most physicians will not add another agent for the 
treatment of RA until three months after the patient started MTX therapy and has not achieved a significant 
clinical response. (Weinblatt, 2013) In prior studies we have shown (Chan and Cronstein, 2013) that many, if 
not most, of the anti-inflammatory effects of MTX are mediated by [CONTACT_844336], a potent anti-inflammatory agent acting at its receptors (primarily A2A and A3). We postulate that 
insufficient levels of adenosine to suppress inflammation are reached in many patients not achieving an 
adequate response to MTX therapy; generally speaking these patients will be prescribed biologic agents (e.g. 
anti-TNF agents). Because ticagrelor blocks adenosine uptake (Cattaneo et al., 2014) and adenosine 
contributes to the therapeutic effects of ticagrelor we further hypothesize that ticagrelor will enhance the anti-
inflammatory effects of MTX in the treatment of RA. Thus, if addition of ticagrelor enhances MTX response 
then it may be possible for patients to avoid use of a biologic therapy.
1.4 Dose Rationale
Ticagrelor 90  mg twice daily will be used in this study. This dose was chosen based on ticagrelor’s antiplatelet 
effect at this dose and use in other indications (acute coronary syndrome, prior myocardial infarction). In 
addition, there is a concentration-dependent response for ticagrelor in vitro in terms of conservation of added 
adenosine to whole blood.  There is also an effect on adenosine induced coronary blood flow of a 180mg 
loading dose of ticagrelor in healthy subjects (Wittfeldt 2013) and after 90mg in ACS patients (Alexopolous 
2013). This effect is mediated by [CONTACT_844337]1 (type 1 equilibrative nucleoside 
transporter), which provides protection for adenosine from intracellular metabolism, thus increasing its 
concentration and biological activity.  Study medication will be taken orally, twice a day. Safety and tolerability 
will be monitored closely during the study. The 30-day study duration is considered sufficient to investigate 
acute safety and efficacy in ticagrelor in RA.

discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery) it should be restarted as soon as possible. 
Because the primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism, patients with severe hepatic 
impairment should not use ticagrelor. 
1.5.2 Risks of all study  related procedures 
Blood draw:  Possible side effects from drawing blood include: faintness, inflammation of the vein, pain, 
bruising, or bleeding  at the site of puncture. There is also a slight possibility of infection.
Risk of brachial artery reactivity  test: There are no known risks associated with the procedures for 
measurement of flow-  mediated vasodilation. Inflation of a blood pressure cuff for [ADDRESS_1173538] < 30 minutes. To minimize risk of hypotension, 
nitroglycerin will not be administered if resting systolic blood pressure is <100 mmHg.
Loss of  privacy and confidentiality: As with participation in any research study, there is always a risk that 
confidential or  private information can be compromised. To minimize this risk, the study team will de-identify 
your samples and replace your identifying information, such as your name, with a bar code label that will not 
be associated with any date related to you (for example, your birthday or street address).
Risk of  Genetic Testing: Any type of genetic evaluation can generate information about your personal health 
risks and  can cause or increase anxiety, damage family relationships, and/or compromise insurability, 
employability and can even lead to discrimination. In order to protect against loss of confidentiality, sensitive 
information will be kept on a secured database and the samples will be de-identified before they are used in 
research. Your name [CONTACT_844351], thereby [CONTACT_844338], such

ticagrelor added to MTX for 30 days.  The primary outcome is improvement in the Disease Activity Score for 
28-joint counts (DAS28, with scores ranging from 2 to 10 and higher scores indicating more disease activity) 
at 30 days.

3.1 General  Design
This is  an open label study to assess the improvement in the Disease Activity Score for 28-joint counts 
(DAS28) with ticagrelor given at [ADDRESS_1173540] active disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_441211] (as defined by [CONTACT_26141]/exclusion criteria).  There will also be a cross sectional analysis of 
baseline platelet activity in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Subjects in the OA cohort will 
not receive any study medication, and will only have one study visit. 
Patients will  receive [ADDRESS_1173541] of care and the dose will remain stable throughout the 
study duration.
A summary of  the study design is noted in the Supplemental Figure of Study Design. Briefly, there are 2 major 
goals: 1) we would like to demonstrate the heightened cardiovascular risk in RA by [CONTACT_844339], 
inflammation and endothelial function in baseline rheumatoid arthritis versus age- and sex-matched patients 
with osteoarthritis; and 2) we would like to demonstrate the effect of ticagrelor in rheumatoid arthritis by [CONTACT_195226]- and post- measures of clinical RA severity, platelet activity, inflammation and endothelial function in 
rheumatoid arthritis before and after ticagrelor therapy.
3.2 Secondary  Study Endpoints
The primary  outcomes of this study are: (1) investigate the heightened platelet profile in subjects with RA 
versus those with osteoarthritis, and (2) demonstrate the improvement in the Disease Activity Score for 28-
joint counts (DAS28, with scores ranging from 2 to 10 and higher scores indicating more disease activity) at 
30 days.  The DAS28 is a composite index of the number of swollen and tender joints, the erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, and a patient-reported disease activity.(Prevoo et al., 1995) A decrease in the DAS28 of 
1.2 or more is considered to be a clinically meaningful improvement.(van Gestel et al., 1996) 
3.3 Secondary  Study Endpoints
Rheumatoid Arthritis  Severity
To assess  whether ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily for 30 days improves:
American  College of Radiology (ACR) 20, 50, and 70 responses, indicating 20%, 50%, and 70% 
reductions, respectively, in the number of both tender and swollen joints and equivalent improvement 
in at least three of five other criteria
Responses  on the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), which is a composite score of the sum of 
tender and swollen joints (28 joints) and the patient and physician global assessments (each scored 
with the use of a scale ranging from 0 to 10), and 
Responses  on the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), which is a composite 
score of the sum of physical function, pain and patient global estimate
Functional  outcomes, as measured with the use of the Multi-dimensional Health Assessment 
Questionnaire (MDHAQ)
Adenosine Activity
To assess  whether ticagrelor for 30 days improves:
Vascular  endothelial dysfunction 
Endothelial function will  be measured by [CONTACT_844340] (BART) before and after 
30 days of therapy because a) this measure has been shown to improve in response to short-term 
therapy in other inflammatory conditions,(Flammer et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2008; Patti et al., 2011; 
Warnholtz et al., 2009) b) it is a validated noninvasive and minimal risk measure of cardiovascular 
health,(Liang et al., 1998; Sorensen et al., 1995) and c) it is predictive of incident cardiovascular 
events and mortality.(Celermajer et al., 1992)
Adenosine  receptor expression on PBMCs

following markers:
ADP-induced platelet aggregation  
Vasodilator-stimulated  phosphoprotein (VASP) index
Monocyte  – platelet aggregation
3.4 Primary Safety  Endpoints
A safety  objective of this study will be to assess the safety and tolerability of ticagrelor in participants with 
active RA despi[INVESTIGATOR_441205].  Bleeding events will be analyzed using accepted bleeding definitions 
(PLATO, ISTH and BARC). Other adverse events will be reviewed within the context of the earlier safety 
experience with the drug.
3.[ADDRESS_1173542](s) of adding ticagrelor for 30-days to participants with active RA after MTX failure on 
the following exploratory objectives:
Soluble  markers of inflammation, platelet and immune activation: IL-6, sCD14, hs-CRP, sCD40L, 
and sP-selectin, sCD163, and CXCL10/IP10. 
Intracellular cytokine concentration  (TNF∝ and IL-6 from PBMCs)
Contingent  upon significant improvement in the primary objective and additional funding, 
measurements of inflammatory transcripts may be performed upon stored frozen PBMCs by 
[CONTACT_844342].

4.[ADDRESS_1173545]  Recruitment and Screening
Recruitment of  patients will come mainly through routine clinical care visits by [CONTACT_844343]. NYU is home to the Center for Musculoskeletal Care and has 
a special emphasis on Arthritis and Autoimmunity.  Over 20,000 rheumatology visits a year are captured at 
NYU Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53066]. Approximately 70 new patients are seen each week in rheumatology clinics 
and practices which can provide 4 to 5 new RA patients a week. Subjects will be recruited by [CONTACT_744772]. Recruitment of patients will come mainly through routine clinical care visits by [CONTACT_844344]. Physicians at 
clinical sites will be aware of the current protocol and will be encouraged to speak with their patients. If there 
is a need for additional patient materials, a separate advertisement will be placed with prior IRB approval. 
Letters to affiliate physicians may also be written that also would be submitted for IRB approval. Management 
of DataCore will also be mining the database for our specific recruitment needs.
Target patient population
The target  study population is male and female participants over the age of 18 who meet the 1987 American 
College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for RA (Arnett et al., 1988) or OA (Altman et al., 1991; 
Altman et al., 1990; Altman et al., 1986)  fulfilling all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. This 
study aims to have 25 subjects in the RA cohort complete all study activities, and 10 subjects with OA to

8 Statistical  Plan
The primary  end point of the trial is the Disease Activity Score for 28-joint counts (DAS28) at 30 days after 
randomization. The DAS28 is a composite index of the number of swollen and tender joints, the erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, and a visual-analogue scale of patient-reported disease activity.(Prevoo et al., 1995) A 
decrease in the DAS28 of 1.2 or more is considered to be a clinically meaningful improvement.(van Gestel et 
al., 1996; Ward et al., 2014) A total of [ADDRESS_1173552] 90% power to detect a before- and 
after difference of 1.2 in the DAS28 at 30 days (assuming a SD of 1.5), with a two-sided type I error of 5%, 
and a 20% attrition rate. 
Power and  sample size analysis was performed to investigate appropriate sample size for evaluating platelet 
activity markers in subjects with RA versus age- and sex matched OA controls. Since patients with RA have a 
heightened inflammatory phenotype and at higher cardiovascular risk than osteoarthritis, we hypothesize that 
the mean measurement of platelet markers for RA is 35% greater (similar to previously demonstrated 
differences in high risk phenotypes) than age- and sex matched OA controls for each measurement. Based 
on two-sided two-sample t-tests with 25 patients in the RA group and 10 patients in the OA group, our power 
is listed in the table for each measure of platelet measure at the 0.05 significance level using mean/SDs from 
preliminary data in healthy controls.

9 Safety and  Adverse Events
9.1 Definitions
Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risk to Subjects or Others
Any incident, experience,  or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
Unexpected  in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study-related documents such as 
the IRB-approved  protocol or consent form, package insert, etc)
Related or possibly  related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that  the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])
Suggests  that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or  social harm).
Adverse Event
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:
results in  study withdrawal
is  associated with a serious adverse event
is  associated with clinical signs or symptoms
leads  to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests
is  considered by [CONTACT_844348]-serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is: 
fatal
immediately  life-threatening
requires  or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]
results in  persistent or significant disability or incapacity
a  congenital anomaly or birth defect
an important  medical event
Important medical events are  those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in 
in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_844328]. 
All adverse  events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events . 
Adverse Event  Reporting Period
The study  period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the 
initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow-up.  For this study, the study 
treatment follow-up is defined as [ADDRESS_1173554] administration of study treatment. 
Preexisting Condition
A preexisting  condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the 
study period.

writing by [CONTACT_844349],  any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end 
of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event 
must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
Post-study Adverse  Event
All unresolved  adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject 
is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator 
should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal 
physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator should notify 
the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or 
terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should also be 
notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a 
subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study. 
Abnormal Laboratory  Values
A clinical  laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following 
conditions is  met: 
The  laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality
The  abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity
The  abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation 
of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.

responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and 
adverse event. 
Neither the  condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event 
in the following circumstances:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267848] a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819726].
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819727], unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].

immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded 
in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.
All adverse  events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be 
recorded and reported immediately.

be reported are those that are:
related to  study participation,
unexpected,  and 
serious  or involve risks to subjects or others 
(see definitions,  section 8.1).  
At the time an  SAE is reported to the FDA via MedWatch, a copy of the report must be concurrently faxed to 
[COMPANY_008] at the time the event is reported to the FDA.  Use the cover page provided by [CONTACT_844350] 
a copy of the MedWatch form.  The cover page will contain the following:
•              External  Sponsored Research (ESR)
•             The  investigator’s name [CONTACT_3816]
•             The  trial name/title and [COMPANY_008] ESR reference number
Investigative site  must also indicate, either in the SAE report or the cover page, the causality of events in 
relation to all study medications and if the SAE is related to disease progression, as determined by [CONTACT_28824].  Send SAE report and accompanying cover page by [CONTACT_8307]’s 
designated fax line: +[PHONE_2704].  Serious adverse events that do not require expedited reporting to the 
FDA need to be reported to [COMPANY_008] at least monthly.  
For Narrative Reports  of Safety Events
If the  report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the 
initial report includes:
Study  identifier
Study  Center
Subject  number
A  description of the event
Date  of onset
Concomitant  medicationsCurrent  status
Whether  study treatment was discontinued
The reason  why the event is classified as serious
Investigator  assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment
Outcome  of the event
9.3.1 Investigator  reporting: notifying the IRB
Federal regulations require  timely reporting by [CONTACT_94106].  The following describes the NYULMC IRB reporting requirements, though 
Investigators at participating sites are responsible for meeting the specific requirements of their IRB of record. 
Report Promptly,  but no later than 5 working days:
Researchers are  required to submit reports of the following problems promptly but no later than 5 working 
days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:
Unanticipated  problems including adverse events  that are unexpected and related
–Unexpected : An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately reflected 
in the  protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, any applicable 
investigator brochure, and the current IRB-approved informed consent document and other 
relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts. 
–Related to  the research procedures: An event is related to the research procedures if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_844330], the event was more likely than not to be caused by 
[CONTACT_28821]. 
–Harmful : either caused harm to subjects or others, or placed them at increased risk
Other Reportable  events:
The following  events also require prompt reporting to the IRB, though no later than 5 working days:

writing by [CONTACT_4530]Complaint of a research  subject when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be  resolved by [CONTACT_5051].
Protocol  deviations or violations (includes intentional and accidental/unintentional deviations from 
the IRB  approved protocol) for any of the following situations: 
–one  or more participants were placed at increased risk of harm 
–the  event has the potential to occur again
–the  deviation was necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm
Breach  of confidentiality
Incarceration  of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and 
the investigator  believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.
New Information  indicating a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of 
severity or frequency.  (e.g. analysis indicates lower-than-expected response rate or a more severe or 
frequent side effect; Other research finds arm of study has no therapeutic value; FDA labeling change 
or withdrawal from market)
Reporting Process
The reportable  events noted above will be reported to the IRB using the : “Reportable New Information” 
function or as a written report of the event (including a description of the event with information regarding its 
fulfillment of the above criteria, follow-up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other study 
documentation).
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_844331].
9.4 Cases of  Pregnancy and Overdose
In case of  pregnancy the patient should discontinue study medication and the study team notify [COMPANY_008]. 
The patient  should be followed by [CONTACT_42498]. If the pregnancy ends for 
any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify [COMPANY_008]. At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy 
meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting a 
SAE.
9.5 Medical Monitoring
It is  the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as 
well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety-monitoring plan (see section 9 Auditing, 
Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of 
serious adverse events.

only 35 subjects, there are no statistical measures for suspending enrollment. In the case of any severe 
adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_844332] (or if) to proceed. Efficacy will be assessed at the end of the study, after all subjects have completed 
all study-related events.

files at the site.  Source data is defined as all information in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_1930], observations, or other activities in a clinical study necessary for the evaluation and 
reconstruction of the clinical study. Source data are contained in source documents (original records or 
certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]). These records will be retained in a secure file for the period as set forth in the Clinical Study 
Agreement. 
10.[ADDRESS_1173560] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
What protected health  information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study
Who will have  access to that information and why
Who will use  or disclose that information 
The  rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. 
In the event that  a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains 
the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that 
have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at 
least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.

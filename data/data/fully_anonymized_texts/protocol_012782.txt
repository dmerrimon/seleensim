Page 2 of 291.0  Purpose of the Study: 
This study aims to create and evaluate Mi Guia study aims , a culturally informed eHealth educational 
and psychosocial intervention for English or Spanish-speaking Hispanic women completing treatment for breast cancer. Mi Guia is grounded in evidence-based paradigms to improve our Primary 
Outcomes: Cancer-Related Symptom Burden and HRQOL and our Secondary Outcomes: cancer-specific distress, depressive symptoms, and markers of Mi Guia use. We propose a two-phase study to 
develop our Smartphone-based intervention that can be disseminated to survivors at a relatively low cost. We will use innovative methodology; MOST framework that will allow us to achieve both optimization and evaluation of Mi Guia by [CONTACT_503226]
9,10. Study components (one on breast cancer education, 
two psychosocial evidence-based components relevant to Hispanic women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer) will be paired with personal tele-coaching. 
Aim 1 (Phase 1, Year 1): Create Mi Guia , an eHealth intervention designed to improve cancer-related 
symptom burden and HRQOL. Aim 1 is further broken down into four parts. Using a mixed-methods approach, we will 1a) collect qualitative data (n= 20) on the study content, 1b) conduct usability testing on the Mi Guia Smartphone application, and 1c) conduct feasibility testing (e.g., field trial) to refine 
the content in the components and the design of the Smartphone-delivered intervention for Hispanic women. Finally, we will add one more part to Aim 1, aim 1d) to conduct interviews with community stakeholders about the Mi Guia/My Guide application. These interviews with community stakeholders will not include any questions about participants. The interviews will only include questions about the application itself and their ideas on how to improve it. 
Aim 2 (Phase 2, Years 2 & 3): Optimize components for Mi Guia through an 6-week randomized trial 
to evaluate the efficacy of Mi Guia relative to a smartphone application on health education (Mi Salud), our control condition. The health promotion application, Mi Salud, includes health education content on nutrition, and general advice on lifestyle choices and prevention. Participants will complete the same procedures regardless of randomization assignment to help minimize potential confounding factors during the intervention or control delivery. Participants will be early-stage women completing active treatment (n= 90) We hypothesize that Hispanic BCS will find the smartphone application, Mi Guia, an acceptable and feasible way of accessing post-treatment relevant information. Furthermore, we expect that, in comparison to the control condition, My Guide will have a measurable, positive impact on this population’s HRQOL and cancer-specific distress.
2.0  Background / Literature Review / Rationale for the study:
Ethnic minority and underserved populations are disproportionately burdened by [CONTACT_67380].
[ADDRESS_648048] growing ethnic minority group in the U.S., cancer is the leading cause of death whereas cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Hispanics also experience substantially lower rates of 5-year cancer-specific survival relative to non–Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Relative to NHWs, Hispanics are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of breast cancer.
[ADDRESS_648049] cancer 
diagnosis for Hispanics is 50 years, which is a decade earlier than for NHW women. Barriers to accessing and effectively engaging in health care, limited cancer information, beliefs about cancer are some factors that may contribute to these disparities.

Page 3 of 29Hispanic cancer patients in the U.S. also report significantly worse cancer-related symptom burden and 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) than NHWs, even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors.3,[ADDRESS_648050] cancer survivors (BCS) remains unknown, thus creating a critical gap in the literature
8. Hispanic women diagnosed with cancer may have difficulty 
gaining access to supportive and psychosocial services that can assist with symptom burden and HRQOL and face obstacles such as cost, lack of insurance coverage, time constraints to name a few
1,11. 
Therefore innovative approaches to providing interventions such as Smartphone technology are especially important for this patient population. Ubiquitous Smartphone use among ethnic minorities in the US provide a unique opportunity to implement a pragmatic technology- and evidence-based psychosocial intervention that overcomes some access to care barriers as well as time and logistical constraints
12. Given that Hispanics own Smartphones and seek health information online from a mobile 
device at similar or higher rates than other groups in the U.S., Smartphone interventions offer an opportunity to overcome obstacles to accessing resources and services that can be culturally informed and provide skills to improve symptom burden and HRQOL
12. We have previously shown that cancer-
related knowledge, stress management, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], and communication can negatively affect the post-treatment survivorship phase, underscoring the importance addressing these components in a psychosocial intervention

3.0  Inclusion and exclusion criteria:
Eligibility Criteria will remain mostly the same for all the phases of the study. Inclusion criteria: 1) 
Female; 2) Diagnosis of BC, non-metastatic, stage 0-IIIA; for women diagnosed with stage 0, either 
radiation or chemotherapy is required as an additional treatment to surgery 3) Completed active 
treatment for BC (surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, current hormonal treatment 
allowed); 4) No current evidence of disease; 5) Within [ADDRESS_648051]-active treatment [e.g., 
surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or combination of the two or three]; 6) at least 21 years of age; 7) 
Able to speak and read English or Spanish; 8) Able to provide informed consent; 9) Elevated score on 
breast cancer symptom burden and HRQOL, measured by [CONTACT_423069]-Breast using an established cut-off score for clinically meaningful, compromised symptom 
burden and HRQOL; 10) Self-identified Hispanic/Latina ethnicity; 11) with the exception of 
nonmelanoma skin cancer, no previous diagnosis of cancer. Exclusion criteria: 1) Visual, hearing, 
voice, or motor impairment that would prevent completion of study procedures; 2) diagnosis of an 
unmanaged psychotic or psychiatric disorder (e.g., clinical depression, anxiety, or PTSD), bipolar 
disorder, dissociative disorder, or other diagnosis for which participation in this trial is either 
inappropriate or dangerous – this includes patients who have life-threatening illness (e.g., end-stage 
kidney disease) or diagnosis of a chronic disease that is associated with a major functional impairment 
(e.g., chronic severe pain, fibromyalgia); 3) Illicit substance or alcohol dependence 4) Suicidal 
ideation, plan, intent; 5) Alzheimer’s, dementia or history of stroke. 6) Scheduled reconstruction 
surgery within [ADDRESS_648052] quality of life and/or study outcomes. To minimize 
threats to internal validity, we evaluate intervention components among a relatively homogenous 
population with regard to cancer type, stage and treatment. Patients with metastatic disease have a

of Life among Hispanic Women Completing Active Treatment for Breast Cancer
Page [ADDRESS_648053] half of the sample for Aim 1c (10 women) meet all 
eligibility criteria, but if need be use the expanded criteria just described. Since the field trial is mainly 
focused on addressing the functionality of the phone application, we have decided to expand the 
criteria since this is a phase in the project when we can be more lenient with eligibility. It is also very 
possible that women other than those with lower HRQOL or high symptom burden could benefit from 
being part of the project.  
During Aim [ADDRESS_648054] had recurrences (see screening questionnaire).
Additionally, during Aim 2, we will exclude women who only received education until the 4th grade as 
we have observed difficulties among participants with limited education that could cause more 
challenges for the participant rather than benefiting them. We will also be excluding women who will 
be traveling or who have previous scheduled events that could hinder their commitment and 
availability for the study. 
Finally, as we did during Aim 1c, in Aim [ADDRESS_648055] questionnaire (the FACT-G7-See screening questionnaire). Our goal is to have at least [ADDRESS_648056]-G7 score (-14).
Participants for Aim 1d will be community stakeholders who have worked with Latina/Hispanic breast 
cancer survivors who would like to view the application and provide feedback.
4.0  Procedures Involved:Specific Aim 1.
1a. We will begin developi[INVESTIGATOR_503207] 20 English or Spanish-speaking 
Hispanic/Latina women (women will be stratified by [CONTACT_331505]) who meet the study eligibility criteria. Individual interviews with the participants will be conducted by [CONTACT_503227] [INVESTIGATOR_503208]/bilingually trained research staff, using a semi-structured guide based on prior work from the PI. The translated final Spanish versions of all participant-facing materials for Aim 1a will be submitted prior to recruitment once the final English versions of the documents have been approved by [CONTACT_1744] #: STU00201961-MOD0034 Approved b y NU IRB for use on or after 1/22/2018 throu gh 11/6/2018 .

Page [ADDRESS_648057] resubmission of documents due to any changes 
requested prior to final approval. 
Potential subjects at the Northwestern site will be identified by [CONTACT_503228] (EDW) 
and EPIC (all oncologists specializing in breast cancer at NU will be informed of this project via email). Study staff will have IRB/HIPAA compliant approval to access electronic medical records (EMR) systems. EDW will release up to [ADDRESS_648058] a phone eligibility screening. 
Participants for Aim 1a and 1b will be recruited from the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer 
Center (RHLCCC). Once we receive IRB approval to add the University of Illinois as a recruitment site for Aim 1c and Aim 2, we will begin recruiting form UIC as well. An IAA will be submitted to the Northwestern IRB prior to recruitment at UIC. Patients will be identified either by [CONTACT_503229].  Across all Aims, participants will also be recruited through Judy Guitelman, the associate director of the Latina Association of Breast Cancer, who is a study community consultant and breast cancer advocate. Once a patient is identified as potentially eligible based on the EMR screening or physician referral, and following physician approval to make contact [CONTACT_10970], prospective participants will be contact[CONTACT_61936] a mailed pre-recruitment letter. Study staff will send the potential participant this letter, which introduces the study. One week later, unless the potential participant contacts the study staff to opt out of the study, the study staff will call the potentially eligible participant to provide additional information about the study. During this call, if the potential participant expresses interest, bilingual and bicultural study staff will proceed with a brief eligibility phone screening to determine further eligibility. Potential subjects recruited from the Latina Association of Breast Cancer will be identified by [CONTACT_503230], the association director. [CONTACT_503265] is informed of the study goals, procedures, and eligibility. [CONTACT_503265] will briefly discuss the study goals and procedures with potentially interested women, and provide them with a study brochure. The study staff will call the women that express interest and agree to being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. During this call, research staff will provide the potentially eligible participant with additional information about the study, if the potential participant expresses interest, bilingual and bicultural study staff will proceed with a brief eligibility phone screening to determine further eligibility.
In order to minimize the possibility of coercion, the UIC PI, [CONTACT_306294]-Tamayo, will be involved in 
identifying potentially eligible participants from her practice, but neither she nor her staff, Yvette Castro, will be involved in consenting participants. Any other member of the study staff will be involved in consenting patients recruited from UIC. This recruitment and consent structure will minimize possibility of coercion for participants recruited by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Perez-Tamayo, the UIC site PI.
The phone screening is a short-answer and multiple choice questionnaire that is estimated to last about 
10 minutes with each participant. The questions address all the items in the inclusion/exclusion criteria above (section 3.0) to determine participant eligibility for the study. Most of the phone screening questions regarding inclusion criteria items 1-8, 10 and 11 are short-answer questions and will serve to IRB #: STU00201961-M OD0034 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 1/22/2018 through 11/6/2018 .

Page [ADDRESS_648059]-B questionnaire (version 4). For exclusion criteria items 1, 2, 5 and 6 we will ask yes/no questions to participants about the diagnosis or impairments mentioned above, and prove with a short-answer question to determine when the specific diagnosis or impairment would interfere with participation/eligibility in the study (because it is unmanaged, too severe and would make participation inappropriate, or because it would confound study outcomes). To further screen for item 2, we will exclude women who have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_503209] 12 months. To address item 3 on substance and alcohol abuse, we will ask the participant a series of short-answer questions to determine if any drug or alcohol use indicate dependence or abuse, in which case the participant would be excluded. Finally to address item 4, we will ask if the person has thoughts of harming themselves and determine the nature and imminence of the threat. Persons with suicidal ideation, plan or intent will be excluded from the study.     
In the event that a participant expresses suicidal tendencies during the screening process (see question 
3 on phone screening form), we will provide immediate assistance over the phone as appropriate and refer them for local treatment. Speaking privately with the participant, we will assess for suicidal ideation, plan of action, and likelihood of carrying out the plan. We will help the participant obtain immediate assistance in the home (e.g., ask if spouse/friend can be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]) and will encourage her to seek medical attention if she is at high risk. Local resource referrals will be kept on file to be used in the event of such an emergency. [CONTACT_503266], Northwestern site co-investigator, is a licensed clinical health psychologist, experienced in psychotherapy, and counseling of patients and families dealing with chronic and acute medical conditions, particularly cancer. Drs. Yanez and Penedo have doctorates in clinical psychology and have provided individual therapy for patients through the supportive oncology program at Northwestern.
The data collected in the EMR Extraction Screening form will not be retained as participant records. 
However, for eligible subjects that consent to participate in this study, the data collected during the eligibility phone screening will be used as study data across both aims. This will clearly be stated in in the consent forms. Using the phone screening data as study data will allow us to minimize participant burden by [CONTACT_456652]-asking the same questions post-consent.
If a participant is eligible after verifying the data collected both in the EMR Extraction Screening form 
and during the phone screening, they will be notified right away on the phone that they are eligible, and be asked if they would like to participate in the study. For participants recruited through Judy Guitelman, no EMR extraction is feasible during screening, for these patients only the phone screening will be used to determine eligibility. If a participant is eligible and would like to participate, we will try to set up a time to meet in person to conduct the consent procedures and the study interview (see interview details below and 7.0 Consent Process). If the eligible participant does not want to participate in the study, study staff will not proceed with further screening. They will thank her for her time and will not contact [CONTACT_503231]. The completed screening documents of potential participants who are deemed ineligible will be destroyed after the completion of screening.
The purpose of the interview is to further understand Latina women’s experiences with cancer and 
survivorship as well as symptom burden, quality of life and unmet needs during the cancer and survivorship experience and assess interest in a technology-assisted intervention. Participants who meet all study eligibility criteria and consent to participate will be scheduled for an in-person interview that will take approximately 60 minutes (see interview script) and take place at our laboratory space IRB #: STU00201961-M OD0034 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 1/22/2018 through 11/6/2018 .

convenient for the respondent (e.g., respondent’s home, local library). Participants will also be asked to complete a technology survey to gather information on their general comfort with technology (e.g., cell phone, smartphones, computers). During the interview, participants will also be asked complete a brief “Knowledge of Breast Cancer Questionnaire, and to review a breast cancer information packet from the National Cancer Institute (attached to the IRB application) and be asked to give the interviewer their opi[INVESTIGATOR_503210]. The demographics questionnaire, interview, Knowledge of Breast Cancer Questionnaire and technology survey are attached to the IRB application. 
Upon completion of informed consent and HIPAA authorization participants will be asked to complete 
questions on their demographics (e.g., Hispanic ancestry, age, income, education) so that we may characterize the study sample. We are also requesting HIPAA authorization in order to obtain medical and treatment-related information from participants’ medical records (e.g., stage of diagnosis, cancer treatments and dates of treatment, medical co-morbidities) as these data will be considered covariates in our data analyses and will be collected using the Post-Consent EMR Extraction form. We will also be obtaining genetic health information, specifically for BRCA susceptibility. Women who are aware of an increased risk of recurrence might experience more distress, and it is important to statistically control for this type of testing to understand the study results.  For participants recruited through Judy Guitelman, the study staff will obtain the necessary information to request the patient’s medical records by [CONTACT_503232]’s office to release the records.  Following completion of their demographics, women will complete the interview followed by [CONTACT_503233]. All interviews will be audio recorded so that they may later be transcribed and coded for thematic content. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_503211]. Participants will be paid $[ADDRESS_648060] of themes and dimensions of major ideas expressed by [CONTACT_4317]. Findings from these interviews will be used to finalize the application content before proceeding to next phase (phase 1b) of our research. We anticipate completion of the interviews by [CONTACT_378050] 2016. 
1b. Following completion of the interviews in 1a and thematic coding of the interviews, participants 
(either those who previously participated who agree to be contact[CONTACT_503234]) will participate in usability testing which is 1b. Eligibility 
criteria is the same across all study aims. Recruitment procedures for new participants are the same as in Aim 1a. However, we anticipate that most is not all women participating in Aim 1b will be participants who previously participated in Aim 1a of the project. Upon completing consent and HIPAA authorization to collect protected health information, participants will be asked to completed demographic and clinical self-reported information. We are also requesting HIPAA authorization in order to obtain medical and treatment-related information from participants’ medical records (e.g., stage of diagnosis, cancer treatments and dates of treatment, medical co-morbidities) as these data will be considered covariates in our data analyses and will be collected using the same Post-Consent EMR Extraction form used during Aim 1a. Participants who already completed demographics and information regarding their cancer treatment in Aim 1a will not be asked to completed demographic or clinical information again. Any participants who were not enrolled in Aim 1a but are now enrolled in Aim 1b as new study participants will be asked to complete their clinical and demographic information using the same forms as the IRB approved forms used in Aim 1a. Researchers Rachel Adler and Francisco Iacobelli from Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) will collaborate with the IRB #: STU00201961-M OD0034 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 1/22/2018 through 11/6/2018 .

If a participant is unable to make it to Northwestern University of usability testing, the members of the study staff will conduct a field visit to the participant’s house to conduct the usability testing. 
We will employ a task-based usability approach, where participants will complete a series of tasks with 
mockups and prototypes of the application and performance measures related to usability will be captured on their ability to complete these tasks such as the USE questionnaire (see attached measures and questions that will be asked in Aim 1b). This test will focus on several aspects of usability: learnability, memorability, ease of use, and efficiency. Participants will complete the usability testing in a controlled laboratory environment while a member of the research team guides them through the process. A second member of the research team will observe, audio record the session, and take notes during the usability test as well as record the section. The usability observer will capture quantitative metrics related to usability performance such as time on task and errors accessing content on the application (e.g., unable to find the homescreen bottom or navigate through the application). The usability observer will also capture qualitative data from think aloud related to appeal, comprehension of words and graphs and appeal of the design of the application (e.g., are the colors appealing, is the font size to small or too big). Participants will also be prompted with questions addressing technical reliability on the application (e.g. problems with the technology) and functional reliability (e.g. problems with application use, integrating the system into daily life). Usability will also be assessed with the USE questionnaire to capture quantitative feedback on the prototype of the Smartphone-based application. Participants in the usability testing will be paid $[ADDRESS_648062] resubmission of documents due to changes requested prior to approval.
1c. Following completion of the interviews in 1a and thematic coding of the interviews, as well as 
participating in usability testing for 1b, participants (either those who previously participated who agree to be contact[CONTACT_503234]) will participate in a 4-week field trial, 1c. We expect to recruit a total of [ADDRESS_648063] decided to expand the criteria. Additionally, it is 
possible that women other than those with lower HRQOL or high symptom burden could benefit from 
participation.

After completing the consent and HIPAA authorization, participants will be asked to complete a 
demographics questionnaire (unless otherwise completed in previous study phases). We are requesting HIPAA authorization in order to obtain medical and treatment-related information from participants’ medical records (e.g., stage of diagnosis, cancer treatments and dates of treatment, medical co-morbidities) as these data will be considered covariates in our data analyses. Only the information listed in the Post-Consent EMR Extraction form used in previous aims will be collected. Additionally as it was requested in previous aims, we will ask participants to let us use the information collected during the phone screening as part of the study records. This will be stated in the consent document. During the consent process, we will also ask participants if they would like to receive text message reminders for their weekly call and final appointment (see Study’s Text Messages document). This is an optional element that is not required for participation. 
Participants will then complete a multiple choice baseline assessment  consisting of 6 validated 
questionnaires:
 the Impact of Event Scale (IES), Knowledge about Breast Cancer (already approved 
and used for previous aims), the Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy scale for cancer (CASE-
cancer), the Unmet Needs Scale, the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial symptom questionnaire, and the FACT-B (already used during the phone screening, but re-administered if more than 3 weeks pass between screening and baseline assessment). This baseline assessment is estimated to take [ADDRESS_648067] meeting, which consists of the same questions as the baseline assessment. 
Once the baseline assessment is completed, participants will go through an orientation of the Mi Guia 
application. Participants will be given the option to either use their own phone to download the application, and be reimbursed $40 for data usage at the end of the trial; or they can choose to borrow a study phone (an Android Nexus 5X) with the application already downloaded. Participants who would do not have their own headset, will be given a headset at no cost. Once the participant downloads the application or is provided with a new phone, we will create a unique account with the participant. Only an email address and password is required to register. If the participant does not have an email address, we will create a temporary email address using pseudonyms, which will be deleted at the end of the trial. During the registration we will go over all the features of the application with the respondent, and address any questions. At this point we would give participants a copy of the orientation document so that they can refer to the images and instructions in the document in the future if they have questions during their individual use. 
The baseline assessment, and the protocol to be used during registration/orientation is attached to this 
IRB application. The total estimated time for completing the demographics questionnaire, baseline assessment and orientation process is 1 hour. After this initial meeting is completed, participants will receive $35, out of a possible $100. The remainder $65 will be received during the second and final meeting of Aim 1c.
Participants will then be instructed to access the application for an average of 3-4 hours per week for 
the duration of the trial (4 weeks total). All the information contained in the application has been IRB #: STU00201961-M OD0034 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 1/22/2018 through 11/6/2018 .

We will encourage these participants to explore My Guide on their own for 2-4 weeks, and to participate in 1 interview about the application that lasts about 1hr. We will use the Exit interview guide already approved for Aim 1c participants for this interview. We will not ask Aim 1d participants any questions about themselves, but only about how to improve My Guide. 
Although the application My Guide has a questionnaire built into the application (the FACT-B/see 
above), we will ask community stakeholders to review the design/interphase of the questionnaire, but to not input any personal information in the app. 
Aim 1d participants will be reimbursed $100 for their participation.Specific Aim 2.  
Aim 2 (Phase 2): Optimize components for Mi Guia through a 6-week randomized trial to evaluate the 
efficacy of Mi Guia relative to a smartphone application on health education (My Health), our control condition. Participants will complete the same procedures regardless of randomization assignment to help minimize potential confounding factors during the intervention or control delivery. Participants will be early-stage women completing active treatment (n= 90), see eligibility criteria above. A IRB #: STU00201961-M OD0034 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 1/22/2018 through 11/6/2018 .

Participants will be individually randomized, 1:1, to the health promotion application (control 
condition) or to the My Guide application (intervention condition). A longitudinal mixed effects linear model will be fit with the outcome (the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast; FACT-B) score as the dependent variable.  Type of treatment (e.g., surgery type, hormonal therapy), time since completion of active treatment, stage of diagnosis, education, marital status, language, comorbidities and age at diagnosis will examined for their associations with study outcomes for potential entry as covariates in the statistical model. Effect sizes will be calculated by [CONTACT_503238]. The potential moderating effect will be examined by [CONTACT_503239]. Similar models will be fit to examine the subscales of the FACT-B. A total of 90 participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 conditions (control or intervention), resulting in [ADDRESS_648073] of each intervention component will be evaluated by [CONTACT_503240] (n= 45) to those who did not receive the intervention (control; n=45), allowing a comparison of main effects. Participants will be compensated $100 and reimbursed up to $22 for travel and data usage. 
Technology.  
Both My Guide (Mi Guia) and My Health (Mi Salud) will be interactive study applications developed 
for use with a Nexus 6 Smartphone on the T-Mobile
© network (see Appendix). Study content will be 
delivered by a combination of text, video, and audio. The health education application, Mi Salud, includes health education content on nutrition, and general advice on lifestyle choices and prevention (see submitted Mi Salud content under supporting documents in our IRB application).We selected Smartphones due to their smaller, more discrete size, and transportable nature that we believe will provide participants with greater accessibility to lessons and assessments. Moreover, Hispanics own Smartphones, go online from a mobile device and use social networking sites at similar or higher rates than do other groups in the US
12 and Hispanic women are more likely to use the Internet to access 
health care information than men.49 Among participants already having a Smartphone with an Android 
platform (we anticipate 25% of the sample), we will evaluate compatibility to run each application to be installed by a member of the research team onto their Smartphone. Participants’ scores on assessments and application usage (e.g., logins, time spent on application) will be captured and sent wirelessly to a secure server at CBITs. All participants will be trained to use the application. 
Trial Design. 
Recruitment and screening procedures will remain the same for Aim 2 as they were for earlier Aims in 
the study (see Aim 1c procedures above, and recruitment procedures below). We will have the same study sites, and the same procedures for identifying and contact[CONTACT_503241]. 
The screening was slightly modified to address the changes to the eligibility criteria mentioned above. 
Also, as we have done in pervious Aims, the data collected in the EMR Extraction Screening form (applicable to NU participants only) will not be retained as participant records. However, for eligible subjects that consent to participate in this study, the data collected during the eligibility phone screening will be used as study data across both aims. This will clearly be stated in in the consent IRB #: STU00201961-M OD0034 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 1/22/2018 through 11/6/2018 .

Eligible participants who want to participate will be randomized to the control (My Health/Mi Salud) 
or intervention conditions (My Guide/Mi Guia) for a total of six weeks. In order to minimize potential confounding factors during the intervention or control delivery, participants will complete the same procedures regardless of randomization assignment. 
We will follow the same consenting and scheduling procedures we used for previous study aims. When 
participants are eligible and agree to participate, we will ask them to set up a time for an in-person consenting process (see consent section below) and for an initial meeting. As we did during Aim 1c, during the call when we set up a meeting for the initial interview, we will also ask participants whether they would like to borrow a study phone or use their own, and if they will need the study team to create a temporary email address to log into the phone application. These preparatory questions will help the research team have all study materials ready for the first meeting. At this point we will also tell participants they can receive a text message to remind them of the appointment location (see Study’s Text Messages and Phone Screening documents). All text messages will be sent only from a secure Northwestern’s Outlook account. 
As it was done during Aim 1c, during the first meeting after the consent and HIPAA authorization, 
participants will be asked to complete a demographics questionnaire. We are requesting HIPAA authorization in order to obtain medical and treatment-related information from participants’ medical records (e.g., stage of diagnosis, cancer treatments and dates of treatment) as these data will be considered covariates in our data analyses. Only the information listed in the Post-Consent EMR Extraction form used in previous aims will be collected. During the consent process, we will tell participants that they will receive text message reminders for their weekly call and final two appointments (see Study’s Text Messages document). 
Participants will then complete a multiple choice baseline assessment consisting of 9 validated 
questionnaires:
 the Impact of Event Scale (IES), Knowledge about Breast Cancer, the Communication 
and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy scale for cancer (CASE-cancer), the COPE, the Social Provisions Scale, 
the Nutrition Questionnaire, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and the FACT-B. This baseline assessment is estimated to take [ADDRESS_648075] of the same questions as the baseline assessment. 
Once the baseline assessment is completed, participants will go through an orientation of their 
corresponding application. 
Participants will be given the option to either use their own phone to download the application, and be 
reimbursed $15 for data usage at the end of the trial; or they can choose to borrow a study phone (an Android Nexus 5X) with the application already downloaded. Once the participant downloads the application or is provided with a new phone, we will create a unique account with the participant. Only an email address and password is required to register. If the participant does not have an email address, we will create a temporary email address using pseudonyms. During the registration we will go over all the features of the application with the respondent, and address any questions. At this point we would give participants a copy of the orientation document so that they can refer to the images and instructions in the document in the future if they have questions during their individual use.

Participants who borrowed a study phone will also receive a mailing packet with instructions on how to mail our study phone. All participants will have the option of receiving a headset to interact with the application, it will be provided free of charge. During the first meeting, participants will receive the first portion of the study incentive $30, and be reimbursed for up to $7 for transportation expenses. 
The baseline assessment, and the protocols to be used during registration/orientation is attached to this 
IRB application. The total estimated time for completing the demographics questionnaire, baseline assessment and orientation process is [ADDRESS_648077] six weeks, participants will be encouraged to use their respective application for two 
hours each week, and will be assigned weekly telecoaching calls based on their level of adherence to the recommended application use (see Figure 1). We will use a stepped-care approach to schedule telecoaching calls with participants in order to enhance adherence during the first six weeks of active application use for both control and intervention conditions. Based on this approach, participants will stop receiving regular telecoaching calls if they continue to use the application for a minimum of 1.5 hours per week. Adherent participants who continue to meet the goal will receive encouraging text messages in lieu of a call (see Study’s Text Messages document), unless they fall under the 1.[ADDRESS_648078] follow-up meeting, they will complete an assessment consisting of the same questions from the baseline questionnaire, as well as an exit interview (the baseline questionnaire, and exit interviews were previously used in Aim 1c of this study). The duration of the meeting is estimated to be under one hour. This meeting can be completed over the phone, or in person at Northwestern depending on the participant’s request. 
Two weeks later, we will contact [CONTACT_387526] a final 30-minute long assessment consisting of the 
questions same questions from the baseline which measure our primary outcomes and intervention targets. Participants will not be expected to use the phone application, and will not receive

intervention application (My Guide) have the opportunity to learn from it if they want to. Similarly, it is possible that the My Health application will be useful for My Guide participants. Participants will be promised access to the other application for [ADDRESS_648080] six weeks of active application use for both control and intervention conditions. We will use a stepped-care approach to schedule telecoaching calls with participants based on their level of adherence to the recommended application use (see Figure 1).

During the decisional balance exercise, participants will weigh the advantages and disadvantages of using the application regularly, and will set personalized weekly goals regarding their usage with their telecoaches. During subsequent calls, telecoaches will review participants’ weekly usage and will give them personalized feedback regarding goal attainment. Barriers and facilitators to usage will be discussed, and telecoaches will problem solve with participants to set future usage goals. All telecoaches will complete training on Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503213]-class training in psychosocial interventions such as motivational interviewing (see Telecaoaching Guide attached to application). Coaches will have access to participants’ activities through the study website interface. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-Investigators have prior experience from CBITs trials.

5.0 Multiple sites: 
Participants will be recruited from Northwestern during all study aims, and Northwestern will be the 
lead site throughout the duration of the study. Participants for Aims 1c and 2 will be also recruited from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Researchers at UIC will be engaged in research procedures, and will also have access to PHI. The NU IRB will be the IRB of record, we will upload documentation to corroborate this agreement, and we will add UIC researchers engaged in research to the NU IRB. We will for the most part use the same documents for UIC and NU participants. However, since recruitment and consenting documents differed significantly prior to the IAA, we will keep a unique UIC brochure and consent document. We will also submit a recruitment script with a different introduction for UIC participants who are recruited in a different way from NU participants (see Recruitment procedures). 
Northeastern Illinois University investigators Rachel Addler and Francisco Iacobelly will collaborate 
with the Northwestern team in developi[INVESTIGATOR_503214] 1b of the project only. The NEIU IRB has also agreed to make Northwestern the IRB of record (see attached agreement between the 3 institutions), and we will add NEIU researchers to the NU IRB. However please note that NEIU researchers will only access participant PHI during Aim 1b. Starting the field trial, NEIU will assist with the development of materials, but they will not access PHI, or be engaged with researching participants directly.  
DePaul University investigator Joanna Buscemi will collaborate with the Northwestern team during 
Aim 1c and Aim 2. [CONTACT_503269] will guide tele-coaching calls during Aim 1c and Aim 2, and she will be accessing PHI during these two phases of the study. Northwestern will request an IRB Authorization Agreement from DePaul University prior to [CONTACT_503269]’s engagement in the research, and upload the signed IAA form to the supporting documents page once approved. We will also upload her CITI training to the supporting documents page. 
6.0  Recruitment:
Participants for Aims 1a, 1b, 1c and 2 will be recruited from the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive 
Cancer Center (RHLCCC). During Aim 1c and 2, the University of Illinois at Chicago Cancer Center will be added as a recruitment site.  Across all Aims, participants will also be recruited through Judy Guitelman, the associate director of the Latina Association of Breast Cancer. 
During Aim 2, we will also begin recruiting from ELLAS, a breast cancer support group organized through The Resurrection Project Chicago. Araceli Lucio, the organizer of ELLAS has agreed to let us distribute brochures through her organization. However, since she works closely with, and holds meetings at various community organizations and clinics in Chicago,  she recommended a more general brochure that highlights our collaboration with ELLAS and the community. As we continue to make more relationships with community stakeholders, we hope to be able to distribute this brochure across different groups that are willing to share it with the community.

[CONTACT_503265] is informed of the study goals, procedures, and eligibility. [CONTACT_503265] will briefly discuss the study goals and procedures with potentially interested women, and provide them with a study brochure. The study staff will call the women that express interest and agree to being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  During this call, research staff will provide the potentially eligible participant with additional information about the study, if the potential participant expresses interest, bilingual and bicultural study staff will proceed with a brief eligibility phone screening to determine further eligibility. 
 7.0  Consent Process .
Upon meeting study eligibility, participants will be scheduled for an in-person visit at our laboratory 
space in the Department of Medical Social Sciences, or at a location of their choice if travel to the university is not feasible, where they will be provided additional information on the study (e.g., risks, benefits, procedures). We will assure that participants have a full understanding of the written informed consent by [CONTACT_503243] (e.g., what is your understanding of the purpose of the study? Can you briefly explain to us what is expected of you? Can you please tell us what are the risks involved? The benefits involved?).

of coercion or undue influence, all study staff who are involved in the consent process will repeatedly remind potential participants that their participation is voluntary and that participation or lack of participation in the study is not related to the receipt of their medical care. 
Written consent will be obtained for each aim of the study. Women participating in the longitudinal aspects of the study (i.e., Aims 1c and 2) will only be asked to complete consent one time. Only the PI, CO-Is, and trained members of the study staff will be able to consent participants.

Consent will be translated into Spanish by [CONTACT_503244]. [CONTACT_503270] is a native Spanish speaker and is IRB-certified to translate documented from English into Spanish. 
Community stakeholder participants for Aim 1d will be read a verbal consent to inform them about the study. There are no risks associated with this aim of the study, and many of the initial interactions with stakeholders will be via phone call or email. It would not be feasible to attain written consent prior to their use of My Guide. Additionally, the questions to these participants will not be about them, but about the application (see exit interview already being used with Aim 1c participants).
8.0  Process to Document Consent: 
As stated above, participant consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_503245]. These forms will be reviewed, discussed as needed, and then signed and dated by [CONTACT_503246] 1a, and 1b, and on the first meeting for the longitudinal portion of the study (Aims 1c and 2). The translated final Spanish versions of all participant-facing materials for Aim 1c will be submitted prior to recruitment once the final English versions of the documents have been approved by [CONTACT_1201]. This will help minimize back-and-forward resubmission of documents due to any changes requested prior to final approval.
Community stakeholder participants for Aim 1d will be read a verbal consent to inform them about the study. There are no risks associated with this aim of the study, and many of the initial interactions with stakeholders will be via phone call or email. It would not be feasible to attain written consent prior to their use of My Guide. Additionally, the questions to these participants will not be about them, but about the application (see exit interview already being used with Aim 1c participants).
9.0  Risks to Participants:
It is possible that participation in the study interviews may cause minimal psychological discomfort 
among women for some women. In our past research on breast cancer survivors, a few participants have at times become tearful when being interviewed about their experiences with cancer treatments. However, this psychological discomfort has always been brief, lasting a few minutes, and appropriate regarding the nature of the discussion.

Specifically regarding the individual (unsupervised) use of the application, we do not foresee that the 
use of the application will cause distress. This application is meant to increase self-efficacy in communication and copi[INVESTIGATOR_503215], as well as increase knowledge about breast cancer. It contains information only from legitimate sources, and it has been vetted by [CONTACT_503247]. Still, we have included disclaimers in the Aim 1c consent, the application and the scripts, reminding participants that the use of the application does not replace standard care provided by a doctor, and they are encouraged to tell their physical before about any changes to their health regimen. They are also instructed to call [ADDRESS_648085] emergency department. There is a slight risk of loss of confidentiality. While any information transmitted through the application is protected (see data security section), there is some possibility that others may see participants open the application on the smartphones. We have included language in the consent reminding participants of this potential risk. Although the application does not collect any identifiable information except for the email address during login, if they have privacy concerns, they are instructed to use the application in private.  One final foreseen risk is that patients occasionally try to access the smartphone or participate in assessments while walking or driving. Risks associated with cell phone use and walking or driving will be managed by [CONTACT_503248]. We do not anticipate the need to withdraw participants from any of the study aims without their consent. All study data that is already collected, including screening data, will be considered usable data in the event that a participants voluntarily withdraws from the study. 
There are no risks associated with participation in Aim 1d for community stakeholder participants.

There are no benefits associated with participation in Aim 1d for community stakeholder participants. 
11.0  Financial Compensation:
Participants will receive $35 dollars, in cash, for their participation in Aims 1a and 1b. Participants will 
be compensated even if they withdraw from the study before finishing. Participants will be compensated $100 for participation in Aim 1c , the field trial. Participants will be compensated $35 at the start of the trial, and will receive the remaining $65 upon completion of the trial. Participants who withdraw from the trial before finishing will not receive their remaining $65. Participants will be paid in cash. We do not foresee any costs to participants because we will cover transportation costs to our laboratory space within the Department of Medical Social Sciences (e.g., reimbursement for parking, CTA travel).

secure, locked cabinet. Participants’ identities will be protected by [CONTACT_503250]/treatment data. Participant names and phone numbers, which are obtained for the purpose of recruitment and scheduling, will be stored on a password protected FSMserver and dest royed at the end of data collection. All 
names and contact i nformation will be stored securely and separately from the completed consent 
forms and electronic data collected from the medical record. Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_503216]-based rec ords (e.g., study data, consent forms) in locked file cabinets 
located at Northwestern University in the office of [CONTACT_503271], Northwestern PI [INVESTIGATOR_503217].  No information will be stored directly on 
desktops/individual computers, but only on the server. Audio-recordings will be destroyed following data analyses
 by [CONTACT_503251], the only location where they are stored. All 
personnel involved in this project will be trained with regard to the importance of  maintaining patient 
confidentiality.
For Aim 2,  all research data will be organized and managed using REDCap electronic data capture 
tools hosted at Northwestern University. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a research management tool which enables a secure study website accessible to all IRB approved research team members regardless of study site. The REDCap website will be used to administer the screening, sociodemographics, baseline and follow-up questionnaires, and to organize medical record review data. My Guide usage data and weekly questionnaires will be captured via the CBITs My Guide interface and uploaded to REDCap to centralize all research information. Once collected, all research data will be imported into SPSS for cleaning and analysis. (The REDCap platform provides automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages.)
All data collected from participants will be kept strictly confidential, except as mandated by [CONTACT_2371]. All 
research files, including study data, are kept on secure, password protected departmental and medical school servers. All electronic data will be stored on secure servers behind firewalls meeting all security requirements of the medical school.  
For Aim 1c and Aim 2, all procedures regarding self-reported and EMR recorded data remain the same 
as were described above.  Regarding confidentiality of information collected and transmitted via the smartphone application in in Aim 1c and Aim 2 of the study, all data collected will be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption to prevent eavesdroppi[INVESTIGATOR_503218].

Development Environment, which is a development and deployment platform created and maintained 
by [CONTACT_503253] (CBITs).  This platform uses up to date security measures that are consistent with those used by [CONTACT_503254]. All data collected via the interventions and assessments are transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption to prevent eavesdroppi[INVESTIGATOR_9408]. In addition, all data stored within the intervention is de-identified with a unique key. Security measures to protect privacy threats associated with users’ computers and devices include the following measures: users are automatically logged off of intervention and assessment tools after 5 minutes of no activity; any data stored locally is automatically encrypted using 128-bit Blowfish encryption based on the user authentication information and cannot be accessed without this information. (After five failed attempts to access, this information is deleted and must be restored from remote backup).  All information collected by [CONTACT_503255], this application does not save any data to the phone’s memory.
During Aim 1c and Aim 2, each participant will login to the application with a unique password using 
an email address. Besides the email required for login, no other PHI will be collected by [CONTACT_67192], or stored/requested by [CONTACT_503256]. The FACT-G7, already administered to patients during the phone eligibility screening, will be re-administered weekly by [CONTACT_99023], however note that the FACT-G7, a multiple choice questionnaire, does not collect any PHI. Application usage (e.g., number of logins to the application) will also be collected by [CONTACT_99023]. 
Participants will be given the option to either use their own phone to download the application, or they 
can choose to borrow a study phone (an Android Nexus 5X) with the application already downloaded. Once the participant downloads the application or is provided with a study phone, we will create a unique account with the participant. Only an email address and password is required to register, if the participant does not have an email address, we will create a temporary email address using pseudonyms, which will be deleted at the end of the trial. 
At the end of participation, the application will be deleted from the participant’s phone, and no other 
information will be collected, unless the participant explicitly requests to continue using the application. Participants that elect to continue using the phone, will be instructed to not complete a weekly questionnaire. For participants that borrowed a study phone, the application will also be deleted from the phone, and the phone will be reset to the factory setting.

Page 23 of 29be transcribed by [CONTACT_503259] (a company used by [CONTACT_503260]). Five to 10% of the taped interviews will be chosen at
 random and their transcriptions checked for accuracy 
by [CONTACT_503258] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a trained research assistant working with the Northwestern PI. A code book will be developed to categorize the responses to the open-ended questions from the interviews.
Planned Analyses Aim 1: Grounded theory methods will be used to guide analyses for Specific Aim 
1a. Grounded theory is appropriate when the study of social experiences aims to explain a process. 
Recordings from the interviews will be transcribed verbatim. All data will be coded using NVivo software. Responses from the interviews will be examined systematically. Based on the principles of grounded theory, two independent raters will generate a list of themes expressed by [CONTACT_4317]. Members of the study team will participate in an iterative group process to develop a coding manual used to identify themes from the interviews. We will reduce subjectivity by [CONTACT_503261] a calculated agreement between coders (Kappa). The codes will then be compi[INVESTIGATOR_503219]. For qualitative data analysis, an analogue to
 statistical power is “data saturation,” or the point at which 
successive information serves only to  replicate previous content themes and no new information is 
obtained. Based upon recommended methods for determining saturation, we will consider a concept as “saturated” when it has been mentioned by [CONTACT_2669] 70% of the sample. Past research reveals that
 
saturation often occurs within the first ten to twelve interviews and basic elements for themes are sometimes present as early as six interviews. We therefore expect to achieve data saturation with our proposed sample of 20 women. Analyses from Aim 1b include descriptive statistics on the USE Questionnaire and qualitative summaries of participants’ comments regarding the usability of the Smartphone-based application. Information obtained from participants in Aim 1b will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-Investigator and based on these data they will make decisions to modify the Smartphone-based application, Mi Guia. Analyses for Aim 1c include descriptive statistics on the Smartphone-based application, Mi Guia (e.g., number of logins to the application, mean time spent on the application). These descriptive statistics will provide valuable information to the investigators as to how often participants are engaging with the mobile application and therefore using the intervention. 
Planned Analyses Aim 2: Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the overall sample and each 
condition. We will use Chi-square, Fisher’s exact tests, and Mann-Whitney U test for nonnormal data, 
as appropriate, to preliminarily examine differences in feasibility between the study conditions. While the sample sizes of [ADDRESS_648093] 80% power to detect 0.[ADDRESS_648094] deviation of the outcome. Follow-up scores on the outcomes, HRQoL and cancer-specific distress, as well as all intervention targets, will be compared between study conditions, adjusted for baseline score, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). We will also reference established cutoffs for clinically meaningful differences for scores on the FACT, and FACT subscales, to identify ranges and patterns of change scores in HRQoL across the study conditions from study baseline to the follow-up assessments. Mixed effects models will be used to model the study outcome scores, and all intervention targets, over time for each group. Type of treatment, time since completion of active treatment, stage of diagnosis, education, marital status, language, comorbidities and age at diagnosis will examined for their associations with study outcomes for potential entry as covariates in the statistical model.

Regarding participant safety, any occurrence of a serious adverse event (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], injury, death) will be discussed at the weekly project meeting. Adverse events will be documented, logged, and submitted to the IRB within the mandated time frame. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_503220], and a cumulative report will be submitted to the IRB on an annual basis as required for continuing review and/or final report. Interim analyses for the purposes of discontinuing the study will only be conducted if during a review of adverse events it seems that risks or complications appear to be greater than those originally stated. For Aims 1c and 2, if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_503221], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_503222]. In the unlikely event of such analyses, the IRB will be informed of these results in a timely manner. Moreover, the IRB will be informed within one working day of any temporary or permanent suspension of the protocol.

Short title: The DITO Study (Effects of Deep Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_493947])
1. PURPOSE OF STUDY 
To gain experience using Impulse Oscillometry to measure lung function in human 
subjects.
To determine if airway impedance, measured by [CONTACT_493968], is impacted 
by a deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_493948] a small cohort of healthy human subjects.
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Impulse Oscillometry (IO) is a noninvasive method of measuring respi[INVESTIGATOR_493949] 
(1).  During IO, pressure oscillations are applied at the mouth during tidal breathing across a 
range of frequencies to measure variables of resistance and reactance (2).  Unlike 
conventional pulmonary function testing that require modified breathing maneuvers like 
forced exhalation or sustained breath holding, IO is analyzed during normal tidal breathing, 
requires minimal cooperation by [CONTACT_374660], and may be advantageous in patients who 
perform poorly with traditional lung function testing.  IO also has the potential of detecting 
small changes in the periphery of the lung (3), which has generated particular interest in its 
clinical utility in obstructive lung disease.  Resistance and reactance variables measured by 
[CONTACT_493969][INVESTIGATOR_493950] (4), which has strong implications for its use in the monitoring and treatment of 
airways diseases like asthma.  Although IO has been investigated for decades in pulmonary 
physiology labs, recent improvements in technology have led to the development of handheld 
devices that can obtain accurate and reproducible measurements during a few minutes of 
tidal breathing.  Consequently, there is renewed interest in incorporating IO into routine 
pulmonary function testing, and in fact IO is currently covered under certain CPT codes.  Co-
investigator [CONTACT_493980] is the Medical Director of Pulmonary Function Labs at the URMC, 
and we are considering incorporating IO into our clinical testing protocols.  We recently 
purchased a Tremoflo C-100 Oscillometer from Thorasys, Inc., and one goal of this RSRB 
proposal is to gain preliminary experience with this procedure and device in healthy subjects.  
We considered conducting pi[INVESTIGATOR_493951] a Quality Improvement / 
Quality Control project, without a full proposal to the RSRB.  However, we realized that we 
could simultaneously conduct a small scale research project, where we address an unknown 
question in the field: what is the effect of deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_493952]?
Deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (DI) has been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on the lungs of 
healthy subjects (5). In particular, DI performed by [CONTACT_493970] (6).  This bronchoprotective 
effect of DI was not observed in patients with asthma (7), suggesting that an inability to 
modulate small airway smooth muscle is an important aspect of asthma pathophysiology.  
The bronchoprotective effect of DI has been mostly evaluated using bronchoprovocation 
testing with spi[INVESTIGATOR_493953] (8).  If the bronchoprotective effect of DI 
Page 2 of 8
Version Date: v4, 2/14/22can be reliably demonstrated in healthy subjects using oscillometry, then there is potential for 
oscillometry to detect the absence of bronchoprotection with DI in individuals with asthma.  
The capability of detecting these small airway changes has strong implications in future 
asthma pathophysiology research.  The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate whether 
there is a detectable difference in oscillometry variables before and after DI in healthy 
subjects.  Thus this RSRB proposal aims to “kill two birds with one stone”, namely to: (1) 
gain experience with a new device to measure lung function, and (2) to determine if DI 
influences respi[INVESTIGATOR_493954].
3. ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION  
The participating UR research locations for this study are:
oMary Parkes Center for Asthma, Allergy, and Pulmonary Care
oPulmonary Clinic at Strong Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]
4. STUDY DESIGN
This is a single-center study that will enroll healthy subjects from a convenient study 
population.
The aims of the study are to:
oGain experience with performing impedance oscillometry using a Tremoflo 
C-100 in healthy subjects.
oDetermine if there is a detectable difference in oscillometry variables before 
and after deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_493955].
Study outcomes:
oOscillometry measurements before and after deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_493956] (Rrs), respi[INVESTIGATOR_493957] (Xrs), and 
resonant frequency (Fres).  
4.1.SUBJECT POPULATION
Up to fifty (50) healthy subjects will be recruited from Mary Parkes Asthma and 
Allergy Center and the outpatient pulmonary clinics at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster 
Medical Center, and from the Pulmonary and Critical Care Division at the 
University of [COMPANY_002]ster.
4.2.STUDY INTERVENTIONS
Measurement of airway impedance using the Forced Oscillation Technique
oTHORASYS® tremoFlo® C-[ADDRESS_635534] Oscillometry System™ (AOS) 
This is a 510(k) FDA approved, non-significant risk device, and will be 
used according to FDA indication, which states: “The tremoFlo C-[ADDRESS_635535] Oscillometry System is intended to measure respi[INVESTIGATOR_493958] (FOT). tremoFlo C-
[ADDRESS_635536] Oscillometry System is intended for use with pediatric and 
adult patients 4 years of age or older. The device is designed to be used 
by [CONTACT_493971], general practitioners, nurses, respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175], 
laboratory technologists, medical researchers and similarly trained 
personnel in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], clinics, and private physician offices”.
This is a non-significant risk device because it does not require any 
Page 3 of 8
Version Date: v4, 2/14/22instrumentation or other procedures, and the subjects simply breathes 
normally for a few minutes into a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_493959].  
We are not seeking approval for a new indication or new patient 
population for the device.  Rather, in this study we are testing its 
effectiveness to detect differences in oscillometry before and after deep 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_493960].
The device will be stored in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical 
Care Medicine Department Office.  Only the co-investigators in this 
study will have access to the device.  The device is portable so will be 
moved to the clinic locations mentioned in section 3 where testing will 
be performed.
The device is handheld with a removable mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]/filter attachment that 
is disposable.  The subject places his/her mouth over the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_493961].  A button is pressed on the side of the device that 
begins the test.  Sound waves are generated at the mouth and 
measurements are made over several seconds.  After about 20-[ADDRESS_635537] is complete, the 
removable filter is disposed.
Data will be collected and stored using a password-protected standard 
laptop used only for this research project.
5. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA
Inclusion Criteria:
oAge ≥ [ADDRESS_635538]
oWillingness to provide basic demographic data (outlined in section 8)
oMust be able to speak and understand English.
Exclusion Criteria:
oUnable to or unwilling to provide consent, perform test, or provide basic 
demographic data.
6. RECRUITMENT METHODS
Subjects will be recruited from the outpatient clinics at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster 
Medical Center and the Mary Parkes Asthma Center.  Recruitment flyers will be posted 
at multiple locations in these sites.  The study will also be advertised to faculty and staff 
of the Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine Division by [CONTACT_493972]. There are no plans to email individual subjects directly.  Our 
outreach to faculty and staff of the Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine Division is 
justified, because they have experience in the ordering, conduct and interpretation of 
pulmonary function tests, and we think many of them will be interested in participating in 
Page 4 of 8
Version Date: v4, 2/14/22the study and learning about this new way of measuring pulmonary function.  We will 
avoid coercion by [CONTACT_493973], and that there is no penalty for deciding not to participate.
Interested participants will be asked to contact [CONTACT_493974].
We currently do not have the resources or infrastructure to enroll non-English speaking 
patients.  We will re-evaluate if this changes at a future date.
7. CONSENT PROCESS
The investigator will review the details of the study with the subject in person or by 
[CONTACT_25600].
The subject will have the opportunity to read the consent form fully and ask questions.  
The subject may wish to consider the study further and can be given a copy of the 
informed consent to take home for review.
The investigator will review with the patient that participation in the study is entirely 
voluntary.  The subject will be informed that the decision to not participate in the study 
will not affect the subject’s personal or professional relationship with the investigator.
The consent process is as follows: the consent will be distributed only as a paper copy for 
simplicity.  The subject will be presented a paper copy of the consent at the time of 
testing.  The consent will be reviewed in its entirety with the subject.  If the subject 
agrees to proceed, he or she may sign two copi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  One copy will be sent home with the 
subject and the other copy will be locked in the Pulmonary & Critical Care Fellow’s 
Office.
8. STUDY PROCEDURES
Consent and testing procedure:
oThe investigator performing the test will discuss the protocol with the subject, 
answer all questions and obtain written consent prior to study enrollment.
oSubjects will be instructed to refrain from taking deep breaths, sighs, or 
yawns, for at least 10 minutes prior to testing.  
oData collected will include oscillometry impedance data (detailed below) and 
basic demographic information.  Demographic information includes age, 
biological sex, self-reported race, and history of lung disease.  All data 
collected will be stored on the research laptop which will be password 
protected.  Data collected will be deidentified.
February 2022 revision:
oIn addition to basic demographic information, subjects will be asked to fill out 
the following validated questionnaires: The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_493962], Asthma Control Test (ACT), the STOP-BANG Score (for 
obstructive sleep apnea), and the Newcastle Laryngeal Hypersensitivity 
Questionnaire (a measure of laryngeal symptoms).
oMallampati score will be calculated by [CONTACT_493975]’s mouth and 
neck circumference will be measured by [CONTACT_2329] a disposable paper measuring 
tape.
Page 5 of 8
Version Date: v4, 2/14/22oNo data will be obtained or accessed from the medical record.
oOscillometry will be performed as follows:
A new disposable mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]/filter will be attached to the device.
A noseclip will be provided and can be self-applied by [CONTACT_423].
The subject will then place mouth over the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].
The subject will place hands over cheeks to limit upper airway artifact.
The subject is asked to breath normally.
The investigator will then press the button on the side of the device to 
begin data collection.
One run of the test is about 20-[ADDRESS_635539] 3 times to ensure repeatability.  
The subject will then be instructed to rest off of the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_493963]. 
Next, the subject will be instructed to take five sequential deep breaths 
to maximal lung inflation (TLC) and maximal lung deflation (RV).  
Subjects will be encouraged to achieve maximal values (e.g. “keep 
going!” during inhalation, and “blow, blow blow!” during exhalation). 
Then oscillometry will be repeated as above.  
Once testing has concluded, the removable mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]/filter will be 
discarded into a biohazard bin.  The device and all surfaces will be 
wiped down with a Cavi Wipe or a Hydrogen Peroxide Wipe.
Only individuals vaccinated against the COVID-[ADDRESS_635540] the COVID-19 virus.
Note that the IO procedure is not considered aerosol-generating, and 
no special procedures are needed to perform the maneuver in COVID 
vaccinated subjects (personal communication from [CONTACT_493981], 
UR Infection Prevention, 6/24/21).
Data storage: All oscillometry data will be deidentified and downloaded to the 
research laptop.  All demographic data will be deidentified and entered into the 
research laptop.  At the conclusion of the data collection phase of the study, the 
deidentified data will be analyzed on the laptop using Microsoft Excel.
Medical Record: Since this study is exploratory in nature, we do not plan to record 
subject’s participation in this study, or any IO results, in the subject’s electronic 
health record.
9. RISKS TO SUBJECTS
9.1. Potential Risks: the potential risks include possible breach of confidentiality, risk of 
Page 6 of 8
Version Date: v4, 2/14/22infection, and discomfort from wearing the nose clip or breathing into the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. 
9.2. Protection Against Risks: The risk of the breach of confidentiality will be reduced by 
[CONTACT_493976].  The risk of infection will be reduced by 
[CONTACT_2329] a disposable mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]/filter attachment, cleaning the device with a disinfectant 
between uses, screening subjects for a transmissible respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], and limiting 
the testing to individuals vaccinated against COVID-19.  Note that IO has been 
performed in tens of thousands of patients worldwide without adverse effects including 
infection.  The risk of discomfort from wearing the nose clip or breathing into the

16. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
Page 7 of 8
Version Date: v4, 2/14/22The risks from participation in this study are low.  Risks are mainly related to breach of 
confidentiality and infection.  The following steps will be taken to ensure data and safety 
monitoring.
Definitions:
Adverse Event: any untoward medical occurrence related to the study 
procedure.
Serious Adverse Event: Any adverse event resulting in an ED visit, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], significant incapacity or death or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.
Participants will be asked to contact [CONTACT_493977].
If a serious adverse event is identified or reported, a physician who is not a member 
of the study team will be asked to perform an independent review.
Adverse events will be reported as required by [CONTACT_493978].
DATA ANALYSIS PLAN
oOscillometry measurements before and after deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_493965] (Rrs), respi[INVESTIGATOR_493957] (Xrs), and 
resonant frequency (Fres).  
oWe will calculate mean and standard deviation for values obtained before DI (Pre) 
and after DI (Post).  Data will be tested for normal distribution and outlier effects. 
Differences between Pre and Post will be determined using t-test or ANOVA. 
Statistical significance will be determined as p<0.[ADDRESS_635541] twenty 
(20) subjects have completed testing.  If promising trends appear with borderline 
significance (e.g. 0.05<p<0.10) or if there are a subset of apparent responders, 
then an additional twenty subjects will be enrolled and analyzed.
oA formal power and sample size calculation was not performed for this study, 
which is exploratory in nature.

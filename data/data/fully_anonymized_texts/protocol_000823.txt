2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
A proportion of individuals receiving preventive monotherapy for migraine may continue to experience 
migraine attacks and migraine -related disabilit y.1,2A large body of evidence suggests that calcitonin 
gene -related peptide (CGRP) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of migrai ne.3,4,[ADDRESS_662699] . Atogepant has demonstrated efficacy in 
significantly reducing the number of migraine and headache days in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] 
(EM) and was recently approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for the preventive 
treatment of EM in adults .Ubrogepant is a nother potent, selective, orally active, CGRP receptor 
antagonist that has been approved by [CONTACT_512365] .
Both drugs have been shown to be safe and well tolerated.  Ubrogepant is similar in structure and 
mechanism of action to atogepant and the additive effect of combination therapy is currently unknown.  
This open -label study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the 
concomitant use of ubrogep ant for the acute treatment of breakthrough migraine headache in subjects 
taking atogepant once daily for the preventive treatment of EM .
2.[ADDRESS_662700] very similar mechanisms of action; therefore, no additional safety risk 
is expected from concomitant use.  An independent Data Moni toring Committee (DMC) will review 
safety data throughout the study and make recommendations to the sponsor including modification or 
early termination of the study.  Considering the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects 
participating in this study, the potential risks identified in association with atogepant and ubrogepant 
are justified by [CONTACT_512366].  Overall, the 
benefit risk assessment is favorable.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the current 
atogepant and ubrogepant Investigator's Brochures (IBs).4,5
Considering the coronavirus –2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects participating 
in migraine studies testing these compounds have been evaluated. Based on the limited information to 
date, no additional risk to study subjects isanticipated with the use of atogepant and ubrogepant. 
Currently, there is no data to suggest that these drugs interfere with the functioning of the immune 
system and ,therefore, an increased risk is not expected.

4INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a multicenter, open -label, Phase 4 study conducted in the [LOCATION_002] (US) to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the concomitant use of ubrogepant [ADDRESS_662701] s who continue to meet all 
entry criteria at Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1) will be assigned atogepant 60 mg once daily for the preventive 
treatment of migraine .
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the study, however, are not 
subsequently assigned to receive s tudy drug.  Rescreening of screen failures is permitted in certain 
situations, with permission from the Sponsor, however, subjects with exclusionary laboratory values at 
Visit 1 (including alanine aminotransferase [ALT]or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]> 1 x upper limit of 
normal [ULN ], total bilirubin > 1 × ULN, or serum albumin < 2.8 g/dL) are not allowed to be rescreened
(note that total bilirubin > 1 × ULN in subjects with Gilbert 's disease is not exclusionary).
The open-label atogepant treatment period will last for 12 weeks ( Visits 2-5). During this study period, 
subject s will use their usual medications for the acute treatment of breakthrough migraine headaches .  
At Visit 5, subject s who complete the open -label atogepant treatment period will c ontinue into the 
open -label atogepant + ubrogepant concomitant use period which will last for an additional 12 weeks 
(Visits 5 to 8). During this study period, subject s will continue to take atogepant 60 mg once daily and 
will also be provided ubrogepant 100 mg to treat up to 8 breakthrough migraine headaches of any pain 
intensity per 4 -week visit interval. During this time, s ubjects willtake a dose of ubro gepant 100 mg to 
treat their breakthrough migraine headache.  If after 2 hours, the migraine attack has not resolved or 
the migraine headache returns within 24 hours, subjects can choose either to take a second dose of 
ubrogepant 100 mg or any of the acute medications listed in Section 5.4.
There will be a total of 9 scheduled clinic visits: Screening/ Visit 1 ( Week -1), Baseline /Visit 2 ( Day 1 ), 
Visit 3 (Week 4), Visit 4 (Week 8), Visit 5 (Week 12), Visit 6 (Week 16), Visit 7(Week 20), Visit 8/ Early 
Termination (Week 24), and Visit 9 /Safety Follow -up(Week 28).
The total duration of study participation is 29 weeks.   Total treatment duration is 24 weeks.  See 
Section 5for information regarding eligibility criteria.

Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the judgment of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been 
fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512362]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s tay.  This does 
not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results 
in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes 
with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is 
not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenz a, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_184119] t based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anom aly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  
Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is 
considered an important medical event.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_662727] be reported within 24 hours of the time the investigator becomes aware 
of the event using the AE eCRF and the hepatic eCRF.

Treatment -emergent elevated ALT or AST lab oratory value ≥3 × ULN.
Potential Hy's law cases: elevated ALT or AST lab oratory value ≥3 × ULN and an elevated total 
bilirubin lab oratory value ≥2 × ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab oratory
value < 2 × ULN.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationshi p to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AEas mild, moderate, or severe.
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The AEis transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The AEcauses the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's 
usual activities.
Severe The AEcauses considerable interference with the subject's usual 
activities and may be incapacitating or life threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (i nformation) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_662729] be 
discont inued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject or in the partner of a study subject, 
information regarding the pregnancy and the out come will be collected.
In the event of pregnancy occurring in a subject's partner during the study, written informed consent 
from the partner must be obtained prior to collection of any such information.  [COMPANY_013] will provide a 
separate consent form for th is purpose.  Pregnancy in a subject's partners will be collected from the 
date of the first dose through 30days following the last dose of study drug.

7.7 Overall Type I Error Control
No multiplicity adjustment for overall Type I Error Control is planned for this study.
7.8 Sample Size Determination
Approximately 235 subjects will be assigned to receive open -label atogepant 60 mg once daily for the 
preventive treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_512363] /Visit 2 ( Day 1). Based on historical data from 
previously completed clinical studies, it is assumed that 15% of subject s will discontinue from the study 
during the atogepant treatment period ( Day 1toWeek 12). Therefore, approximately 200 subjects will 
be assigned to als o receive ubrogepant 100 mg for the acute treatment of migraine starting at Visit 5
(Week 12) . 
This sample size will provide estimation for AEs of interest occurring in either the open -label atogepant 
treatment period (Day 1toWeek 12) or the open -label atogepant and ubrogepant concomitant use 
treatment period (Weeks 1 2to 24) with a precision (defined as the half width of 95% confidence 
interval) of approximately ± 3% to 5%.

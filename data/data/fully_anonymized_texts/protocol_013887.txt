ECOG -ACRIN  E2108  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 10, [ADDRESS_502110] cancer is well established. However, approximately 5% of 
women with primary breast cancer in the [LOCATION_002] present with Stage IV disease. The traditional approach to this problem has been to treat with systemic therapy, and to provide therapy for the primary tumor only when palliation is required. There is presently no consensus regarding  optimal local therapy for these women, and treatment may vary 
from mastectomy (often justified as “toilette” mastectomy, in order to prevent 
uncontrolled local disease during the remainder of the patient’s life), to obtaining a 
tissue diagnosis with needle biopsy. If the primary tumor is excised for diagnosis, follow-up radiation is almost never used in the setting of distant metastases. According to the present paradigm, once metastases have occurred, local therapy provides no survival advantage, and should not be pursued. The alternative paradigm is that the primary 
tumor is a source of re- seeding of distant sites and therefore elimination of this source of 
metastasizing cells may be of benefit. Data from a SWOG trial of renal cell carcinoma 
are pertinent to this argument. The worth of nephrectomy was examined in patients with 
Stage IV disease, who were randomized to interleukin therapy, with or without nephrectomy. Results from this trial show an improvement in survival for the 
nephrectomy group, with overall median survival increasing from 8 months without 
nephrectomy, to 11 months for patients in the nephrectomy arm (1). These findings raise the possibility that aggressive local therapy may contribute to prolongation of survival in other tumors.  
Data from other tumor types may also point to a possible survival advantage for patients 
with distant metastases undergoing resection of the primary tumor. A retrospective 
analysis of patients with asymptomatic primary  colon cancer and distant metastases 
experienced longer survival following primary tumor resection (2). Resected patients 
had prolonged median (16 versus 9 months, p < 0.001) and 2-year (25% versus 6%, p < 0.001) survival compared with patients never resected. Similar results have been reported for gastric cancer (58, 59, 60, 61). These findings are undoubtedly influenced 
by a bias favoring patients who were selected for resection, but in the absence of 
randomized trials, the possibility that resection has a salutary effect on survival in patients with metastatic carcinomas of the colon or stomach remains open. 
The past seven years have witnessed a re-examination of the use of local therapy in 
women with Stage IV disease, because of an accumulation of retrospective data suggesting that local therapy may also be important in this group of women, and may 
improve survival. At least nine retrospective studies (4-12) have examined the impact of 
surgical resection of the primary tumor in the setting of metastatic disease, and eight 
show a reduction in the hazard of death that ranges from 40% to 50%. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_398529], the improvement in survival seen in the surgical group cannot be definitively attributed to the resection of the primary tumor 
since in most studies the women in the surgical groups were younger, had smaller 
tumors, fewer metastatic sites, and were more likely to have bone/soft tissue metastases rather than visceral disease. Additionally, it is not possible from these retrospective studies to assess the value of local therapy components other than resection of the primary tumor (i.e. axillary dissection and local radiotherapy). It is therefore necessary to conduct a randomized trial to formally test the hypothesis 
generated by [CONTACT_398560]. The inclusion of appropriate correlative 
science endpoints will provide unique opportunities to understand the biology of 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2108  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 10, [ADDRESS_502111] cancer. The alternative to a randomized trial is a prospective registry 
study, but such a design will serve only to reinforce existing biases (the retrospective 
data discussed below testify to the fact that current clinical decision-making seems to reliably identify women who will do better). A prospective registry trial will not allow the crucial distinction of whether women chosen for surgery have tumors that are biologically indolent, or whether the course of their tumors is being altered by [CONTACT_398561].  
The design of such a randomized trial should incorporate the standard elements of 
current therapy for metastatic breast cancer (i.e. the primacy of systemic therapy), allow flexibility in the choice of systemic therapy regimens that accommodate the biologic variation of breast cancer, and test the value of early, complete local therapy (resection with free surgical margins plus radiotherapy) against the current standard (i.e. local 
therapy at the discretion of the treating physician, only for palliation of progressive and 
symptomatic local disease) 
1.[ADDRESS_502112] cancer undergo 
surgical extirpation of the primary tumor. These studies are based on data from 
the National Cancer Database (NCDB) (4, 13) , two European Tumor Registries 
(5, 12), four large comprehensive cancer centers (6, 8, 9, 10)  , and the SEER 
database (7) and show that surgical resection of the primary tumor has been 
performed in 30-55% of women with de-novo Stage IV breast cancer. Data on the use of follow -up radiation therapy in this setting is very sparse, but a French 
study where primary radiotherapy was used for the in-breast disease shows very similar benefit (67). These studies are remarkably consistent in the finding that women who undergo surgical therapy for the primary tumor in the setting of metastatic disease fare better than those whose primary tumor is left intact. However, the entire published literature on this topic consists of retrospective 
reviews, all subject to the same selection bias: i.e., healthier women with lower 
disease burden were offered surgery.  
Evidence supporting the hypothesis that local therapy is useful in women with 
metastatic breast cancer include the time-course of local failure and metastatic disease (14) , and the survival benefit of locoregional radiotherapy when 
compared to patients treated with adjuvant systemic therapy alone (15-17) . 
These data suggest that uncontrolled local disease may act as a source of continued seeding of distant metastases. Thus local tumor burden may affect outcome for patients with local regional disease and metastases, regardless of whether those metastases are covert (Stage II-III) or overt (Stage IV). 
1.2 Observed Selection Biases  
Across the majority of studies, women treated with surgical resection of the primary tumor tend to be younger, with better access to care (in the US, this equates with European ancestry and being married), smaller tumors, single organ-system metastatic involvement, and bony or soft tissue metastases (rather than visceral metastases). In the analyses where margin data were available for a majority of patients, the presence of tumor -free margins was significantly 
associated with improved survival and benefit of surgical resection (4, 5). 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2108  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 10, [ADDRESS_502113] Studies  
These include the timing of metastatic diagnosis relative to the surgical 
procedure; the use of axillary dissection; and the use of loco-regional 
radiotherapy. The timing of the surgical procedure is important since women who underwent surgery with the diagnosis of Stage I- III breast cancer, were 
radiologically staged in the post-operative period, and found to have metastases may have a better prognosis than those who were diagnosed with metastases 
prior to surgery. This issue is not well -addressed in most of the published series, 
raises skepticism about existing retrospective data, and adds justification to the need for a randomized trial. In one small study where this distinction was clearly made, women who underwent surgery following the diagnosis of metastases derived no benefit from surgical resection of the primary (18) . In another 
retrospective analysis, three intervals were defined, following diagnosis: less 
than 3 months, 3-9 months, and > [ADDRESS_502114] three months following diagnosis had shorter survival than those undergoing tumor resection more than three months after diagnosis (19) . These authors did 
not specifically examine the timing of systemic therapy, but it is reasonable to 
assume that women undergoing immediate surgery were not known to have 
metastases, and did not receive systemic therapy prior to surgical intervention. 
These results highlight the fact that retrospective analyses will not provide an unbiased evaluation of the role of local therapy in the setting of metastatic disease, since most of the published studies describe their inclusion criterion as “stage IV at diagnosis” with no further discussion of the timing of surgery.  
If surgical resection of the primary tumor is useful for women with metastases, 
this benefit seems to require minimization of the local tumor burden (as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_398562] -free 
margins); it appears logical therefore that the excision of involved axillary nodes would also be beneficial. Such a trend towards a benefit of axillary dissection is observed in two studies but most analyses lack the data to examine this effect.   
In the NCDB study  (4), although extent of nodal disease was not significantly 
related to survival, women undergoing total mastectomy were much more likely 
to have nodal dissection, and this may have contributed to the survival advantage observed in the TM group. In the Geneva study  (5), axillary dissection 
was performed in 24% of patients, and there was a trend towards a larger benefit for women who had both negative surgical margins and axillary dissection (HR 
0.2, 95% CI 0.02-1.9). 
 Regional radiotherapy data are also lacking in the published studies, although 
local radiation was used in women undergoing breast conserving surgery in 
Geneva, and the lack of radiotherapy increased the hazard of death independently. The inability to distinguish local radiation from radiation to 
metastatic sites is a limitation of the data in the NCDB, and in the SEER 
program, where radiotherapy to local or distant sites has not been distinguishable.  In general, the use of locoregional radiotherapy is extrem ely 
variable in the reported literature, although a recent study suggests added benefit with the use of surgery plus radiotherapy [79]. S ince radiotherapy is 
clearly crucial in the local control of non-metastatic breast cancer, and adds 
survival benefit in most categories of risk [78], radiotherapy constitutes a logical 
component of a test of loco-regional therapy in the metastatic setting. In fact if 
radiotherapy is not included in such a trial, and a benefit of surgical resection is 
Rev. 7/13 
Rev. 4/14 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2108  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 10, [ADDRESS_502115] the option of making radiotherapy discretionary in such a trial; given the survival benefit attributable to the use of RT in the non-metas tatic setting, and the 
suggestion that local control is associated with improved survival in the 
metastatic setting (20).  
1.[ADDRESS_502116] Wall Outcomes  
The frequent use of surgical resection in women presenting with Stage IV 
disease is somewhat surprising.  The main justification for surgical extirpation of the primary tumor in this setting so far has been the so-called “toilette” resection, 
but many of the patients undergoing partial and total mastectomy had T1 or T2 
tumors. This trend highlights the fact that that uncontrolled local disease, with its attendant impact on quality of life, is a feared complication among both physicians and patients.  It is reasonable to assume that no (or incomplete) resection is a risk factor for the occurrence of uncontrolled chest wall disease, 
but direct data regarding this are limited (68).  A recent retrospective analysis included [ADDRESS_502117] cancer; chest wall outcomes were examined relative to the use of early (within 6 months of diagnosis) surgical resection of the primary tumor (20). The early use of surgery 
reduced the odds of symptomatic chest wall disease by 86% (adjusted OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.039,0.491), and a controlled chest wall reduced the hazard of death by 
60% (HR 0.4, 95% CI 0.260, 0.662).  In women with the analogous situation of 
synchronous local and distance recurrence following breast conserving therapy for an initial breast carcinoma, women undergoing resection of the in-breast recurren ce, whether by [CONTACT_398563], experienced 
better local control and overall survival (21) . 
1.5 Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQ L) Assessment  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_398530], surprisingly little is known regarding the frequency of disease -related symptoms from uncontrolled chest wall disease 
among women with metastatic breast cancer. None of the studies that have examined the impact of surgical therapy on survival have looked at HRQL 
outcomes. HRQL is an important question in this population because treatment 
decision-making regarding elective local therapy should be driven by [CONTACT_398564]. Based on clinical observations, it is reasonable to assume that women receiving elective local therapy will  
experience treatment-related symptoms associated with surgery and radiation 
that may adversely impact HRQL. Women in the palliative local therapy may experience decrements to their HRQL due to disease-related symptoms, namely pain due to tumor replacement of the breast, ulceration, and skin nodules. Therefore, both treatment groups may experience decrements to their HRQL but from different sources (ie. treatment- vs. disease-related) and at different points 
in time (ie. at the time of elective local treatment vs. later on with disease progression). We have designed an HRQL assessment among trial participants 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2108  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 10, [ADDRESS_502118] Trial Outcome Index 
provides a composite score which captures physical well -being, functional well -
being and disease-specific co ncerns (ie. breast cancer) and is commonly used 
as an HRQL endpoint for cancer clinical trials. The 24-item FACT-Breast Trial 
Outcome Index (FACT-B TOI) consists of the physical and functional well -being 
scales (14 items) from the FACT – General [ADDRESS_502119] Cancer Subscale 
(10 items) of the FACT.  The FACT- General consists of [ADDRESS_502120] Committee protocols (eg. E1193, E2100, E1105). Results from E1193 were used to develop 
minimally important difference scores (MIDs) for the FACT-B TOI (11). 
Secondary HRQL analyses will examine treatment arm differences on the FACT-Breast subscale score and the FACT-General score. 
Exploratory analyses will examine specific symptoms, namely lymphedema, pain 
and discomfort in the breast and chest wall, and anxiety secondary to tumor growth. These target symptoms were selected based on clinical experience of 
the study chair in consultation with expert clinicians. In addition, five items from the FACT Breast cancer subscale and four items from the FACT-G have been 
selected a priori for individual item analysis to assess differences in pain, body image, and worry between treatment arms. Given the lack of an available scale to assess these concerns in a tailored and concise manner, we have written 
additional items for the FACT Breast cancer subscale to capture these concerns. 
We added four items to assess lymphedema. We added one item to assess 
worry about tumor growth. We added two items to assess discomfort in the breast and chest wall. We added two items to assess the effects of tumor nodules and ulcers on functional well -being. Because these items are 
exploratory, we will examine the psychometric properties of each item as well as 
composite scores (eg. summation of lymphedema items) prior to calculating 
treatment arm comparisons. In addition we will use data collected from this trial to validate these items. Since no validated instruments are available for issues related to chest wall symptoms, analyses to examine specific symptoms, namely lymphedema, pain and discomfort in the breast and chest wall, and anxiety 
secondar y to tumor growth will need to be exploratory. 
1.6 Scientific questions regarding the relationship between the primary tumor and 
metastatic sites  
Data from studies going back several decades raises concerns that resection of 
the primary tumor in the setting of metastatic disease will enhance the growth of 
distant lesions (24, 25), and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_398531], so that distant lesions grow once the primary is Rev. 4/14

23 5. Treatment Plan 
5.1 Treatment 
 Patients may be registered to Step 1 (Arm S) prior to initiation of systemic 
therapy OR up to 30 weeks after start of systemic therapy. Full local and distant 
disease evaluation (clinical and radiological) must have been performed a maximum of [ADDRESS_502145] be repeated prior to 
Step 2 randomization. Patients with progressive disease per the criteria in Section 3.2.4
 will not randomize to Step 2 but will be followed for survival. Those 
with stable or responsive disease will be randomized to receive elective local therapy (Arm B) versus the palliative local therapy (Arm A) when/if needed. Systemic therapy will continue on both treatment arms as directed by [CONTACT_1963]. Patients who had advanced local disease at registration can be randomized if the local disease is now considered operable by [CONTACT_398572].  
5.1.1 Systemic Therapy (Step 1: Arm S)  
Optimal systemic therapy will be determined by [CONTACT_398573], patient age, and menopausal status. The use of NCCN or equivalent guidelines are encouraged. First-line systemic 
therapy may also be offered on a Phase II or III trial, and may be 
randomized at Step 2, as long as there is no evidence of progression (see Section 6.1
). A change in systemic therapy is allowed for toxicity 
or at physician discretion (e.g. switch from chemotherapy to 
endocrine therapy), as long as the change is not for disease progression. However, randomization at end of 1st regimen is 
encouraged.  
5.1.2 Local Therapy Treatments (Step 2: Arms A and B) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Arm A: Continued Systemic Therapy  
Systemic  therapy will continue as directed by [CONTACT_30780].  
Local therapy should be offered to patients only if needed for palliation of symptoms such as tumor ulceration, pain, 
bulky adenopathy causing arm symptoms, and other similar situations where therapy is designed specifically to address symptoms at the local site. It may consist of radiotherapy alone, surgery alone, or the combination.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Arm B: Early Local Therapy  
Surgery is to occur no later than [ADDRESS_502146] conserving therapy (BCT) or total mastectomy Rev. 7/12, 2/13

24 (TM). If BCT is chosen, free surgical margins must be 
achieved with re-excision or mastectomy (no minimum 
margin width is required). Axillary management should 
parallel that used for non -metastatic breast cancer. Axillary 
dissection is required if clinical and radiologic evaluation at initial registration was suggestive of axillary disease and axillary radiation is not planned. For women not receiving axillary dissection, sentinel node biopsy should document 
an axillary nodal burden of 1-2 involved lymph nodes (i.e. 
ACOSOG Z -11 criteria may be applied if axillary radiation 
is not planned). For women undergoing TM, reconstructive 
surgery will be allowed at the discretion of the treating physician, recognizing that this may delay the continuation 
of systemic therapy and complicate radiation planning. 
Surgical quality assurance will be coordinated with the ECOG -ACRIN Surgery Committee. 
Systemic therapy may resume after recovery from surgery as directed by [CONTACT_1963]. Systemic therapy will 
continue directed by [CONTACT_1963].  
Following surgery, radiotherapy is to be given as outlined 
in Section 5.3

5.2 Health-Related Quality of Life Assessment  
Overall health-related quality of life (physical, functional, emotional and social well-being) will be assessed by [CONTACT_398574]-G. Breast cancer -
specifi c concerns will be assessed by [CONTACT_398575]. Participants will complete the 27-item FACT- G, the 10-item FACT-
Breast subscale and [ADDRESS_502147]-B TOI is calculated by 
[CONTACT_104149] -being (7 items), functional well -being (7 items) and 
breast cancer -specific (10 items) scales from the FACT. In addition, five items 
from the FACT Breast cancer subscale and four items  from the FACT-G have 
been selected a priori for individual item analysis to assess differences in pain, body image, and worry between treatment arms. Given the lack of an available scale to assess these concerns in a tailored and concise manner, we have written additional items for the FACT Breast cancer subscale to capture these 
concerns (four items to assess lymphedema, one item to assess worry about tumor growth, two items to assess discomfort in the breast and chest wall, and two items to assess the effects of tumor nodules and ulcers on functional well -
being). Because these items are exploratory, we will examine the psychometric properties of each item as well as composite scores (eg. summation of 
lymphedema items) prior to calculating treatment arm comparisons. In addition 
we will use data collected from this trial to validate these items. 
 The FACT-Breast and additional items (referred to as the FACT-Breast + Local 
Symptoms -[ADDRESS_502148]- B + LS -9) to assess HRQL will be administered at five 
time points: step 1: registration (+/- 14 days); step 2: randomization ; six months 
post-randomization (+/- 14 days); [ADDRESS_502149]-randomization (+/- 14 days); 
and [ADDRESS_502150]-randomization (+/- 14 days). It is anticipated that

5.2.1 QOL Instrument Administration Instructions  
[IP_ADDRESS] The questionnaires must be administered at the timepoints listed above. The patient should be 
instructed to respond to the questionnaires in terms of his/her experience during the time frame specified on each questionnaire. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The CRN/CRA sh ould read the instructions printed on the questionnaire to the patient and 
ensure the patient understands the instructions. It is important to assure the patient that all material on the questionnaire is confidential and will not be shared with the health care team and that it will not become part of the medical record. It is permissible to assist the patient with the completion of the questionnaires as long as the staff person does not influence the patient’s responses.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Whenever possible, the HRQL assessment should be administered at the clinic visit before the patient is seen by [CONTACT_099], before evaluations are performed and before test results are shared with the patient. In the event that the questionnaires are not administered at the clinic visit, the HRQL data can be collected by [CONTACT_398576]. 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2108  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 10, 2015 
27 [IP_ADDRESS] Assistance in reading the questionnaire is permitted if the 
patient is unable to complete the questionnaire on his/her 
own (e.g. difficulty in reading, elderly). It is important not to 
influence the response of the patient. Note why the patient required assistance and the type of assistance given. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients should be instructed to answer all the questions regardless of whether the symptoms or conditions asked about are related to the cancer or cancer treatment. 
Discourage family members from being present during 
questionnaire completion or from influencing the patient’s responses.The questionnaires must be reviewed by [CONTACT_398577]. If the patient has marked more than one 
answer per question, ask the patient which answer best reflects how they are feeling. If the patient has skipped a question or questions, the patient should be asked if he/she would like to answer it. If the patient refuses, it 
should be indicated on the questionnaire that he/she 
declined to answer the item.  
[IP_ADDRESS] If the patient refuses or cannot complete the questionnaire at any time point, he or she should be asked to do so at the next scheduled HRQL assessment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The patient may decline to complete the HRQL 
assessment for any reason. The reason must be 
documented on the Assessment Compliance Form.  
[IP_ADDRESS] I f a patient misses an appointment on the scheduled date, 
the questionnaires may be completed by [CONTACT_398578]. If the missed scheduled date 
is on a treatment date, the quality of life assessment will be done when the patient comes for the rescheduled treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] If a patient cannot complete the quality of life questionnaires because he/she is too sick, this should be 
documented on the Assessment Compliance Form.  
5.3 Radiation Therapy  
Radiation therapy (if indicated) must begin within 12 weeks of final therapeutic 
surgical procedure (including re-excision for free margins and completion of axillary dissection). After breast conservation surgery, all patients will receive 
definitive breast irradiation. Definitive breast irradiation will include the whole 
breast. A boost to the primary tumor bed is optional, provided that the margins of excision are pathologically confirmed as negative. Nodal radiation can be added for node positive patients at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.  
After mastectomy, post mastectomy radiation treatment (PMRT) will be given at the discretion of the treating surgeon and radiation oncologist. All patients with 4 Rev. 7/12  
ECOG -ACRIN  E2108  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 10, [ADDRESS_502158] been completed (see below).  For left sided radiation treatment, the volume of 
heart included within the radiation fields should be carefully assessed.  
5.3.1 Required Benchmarks  
Centers participating in this protocol using 3D conformal techniques 
are required to complete the 3D Benchmark; those treating with IMRT must complete the IMRT Questionnaire and either the QARC 
Benchmark or irradiate the RPC’s IMRT head and neck phantom. All 
Benchmark material can be obtained from the Quality Assurance Review Center (www.QARC.org) and must be submitted before patients on this protocol can be evaluated. Contact [CONTACT_174631] (http://rpc.mdanderson.or g/rpc) for information regarding their IMRT 
phantoms. Patients will be considered unevaluable if approved 
benchmarks are not on file at QARC.  
5.3.2 Equipment 
Modality:  All patients must be treated with a linear accelerator with 
nominal photon energy between 4 to 18MV (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 6 MV). Electron 
therapy is permitted for supplemental boost to the intact breast (after 
breast conserving surgery) or to the chest wall. Co-[ADDRESS_502159]-mastectomy RT. 
Calibration:  The calibration of therapy machines used in this protocol 
shall be verified by [CONTACT_174630] (RPC).  
5.3.3 Target Dose [IP_ADDRESS] Dose Definition 
The absorbed dose is specified as Gy to muscle. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Total Dose  
For breast conserving therapy: radiation fractionation 
options for the whole breast treatment are: (a) conventional 
fractionation of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy per day to 45 - 50.4 Gy; or (b) 
accelerated whole breast radiation to a dose of 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions of 2.66 Gy each (Whelan 2002). If a boost to the primary tumor site is given using conventional fractionation, then the recommended total dose to the 
primary tumor site is 60- [ADDRESS_502160] dose is Rev. 2/13 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2108  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 10, 2015 
29 required to be either: (a) 2.0 Gy daily fractions to 50 Gy 
total dose in 25 fractions; or (b) 42.[ADDRESS_502161] mastectomy radiation therapy: Fractionation may 
be either (a) 1.[ADDRESS_502162] wall, 
and 45 Gy to the supraclavicular field or (b) 2.[ADDRESS_502163] wall, and 46 Gy to the supraclavicular field.  IMN's and full axilla may be treated at the discretion of the radiation oncologist.  A chest wall boost of up to [ADDRESS_502164].  
5.3.4 Time and Dose Considerations  
[IP_ADDRESS] Fractionation 
Patients will receive one treatment per day, five days per 
week (Monday through Friday).  All fields will be treated 
each day.  At least two fractions must be given during the 
first week of treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Interruptions  
No special considerations need to be made for treatment delays of 1 week or less.  If treatment is delayed more than 1 week but less than 2 weeks, notify the study chair.  If 
treatment delays of more than two weeks occur, the patient 
will be considered off-study. The reason(s) for any break must be clearly recorded in the treatment record.   
If there are any changes in the patient’s status (i.e., early discontinuation of protocol treatment, delay in starting 
radiotherapy, or break in radiotherapy) these should be 
communicated in writing to QARC by [CONTACT_6791] ([PHONE_8038] or email to [EMAIL_7623]
 with a copy to the Radiation 
Oncology Co-Chair.

surgery followed by [CONTACT_398579]) have been published 
by a number of expert groups or panels (70,72,76,77).  Similarly, guidelines for post mastectomy radiation treatment (PMRT) have been published by a number of expert groups or panels (70,71,73,74,77). 
It is anticipated that most patients will be planned using CT based 
planning tools. Guidelines are also presented for fluoroscopy based 
planning techniques.

•  Verification process when the 
lumpectomy cavity can be identified on CT: Review of the dose distribution 
on CT slices that include the lumpectomy 
cavity is requested to verify that the cavity, as demarcated by [CONTACT_398581], is being covered by [CONTACT_398582]. Acceptable 
WBI must demonstrate that the cavity is 
included in ≥ 90% isodose line.  If not, changes in the field width, gantry, collimator, or selection of wedges or other adjustment must be done to 
achieve this. The radiation oncology 
facility is to submit one axial CT slice 
demonstrating that the identified lumpectomy cavity is covered by > 90% isodose line and a DRR of the tangent field.  
•  Verification process when the lumpectomy cavity cannot be identified on CT: For some patients receiving WBI after chemotherapy, the lumpectomy cavity may have resolved and is no longer visible on the CT for 
radiation planning. In these instances, 
the postoperative CT submitted for registration to this  study can be used. 
The radiation oncologist can identify on the postoperative registration CT a 
representative axial slice with the 
lumpectomy cavity present. A comparable anatomic axial slice from the radiation planning CT with the isodoses present should be found and verify that the ≥ 90% isodose line is covering the 
region where the lumpectomy cavity was previously visible. Both the CT slice from

are to be submitted. A DRR of the WBI tangent fields should also be submitted. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Fluoroscopy -based PMRT treatment plan 
For patients planned using fluoroscopy -based simulation 
techniques, the chest wall will be treated from the inferior 
aspect of the clavicular head to the level of the diaphragm 
or to the level of 2cm below the contralateral inframmary fold. A wire will be placed on the chest wall scar to validate 
scar location on simulation images. Medial and lateral field edges will extend from the midline to the mid-axillary  line. 
Field edges marked on a CT scan will be submitted for review. 
For patients treated to the supraclavicular field, the inferior 
border will be matched to the superior border of the chest wall field using a non-divergent technique. The medial 
edge will  be at the lateral edge of the vertebral body. An 
angled technique is permitted to limit swallowing 
discomfort. The upper border will extend on or about to the level of C4 to cover the supraclavicular lymph nodes.. The lateral border will be lateral to the humeral head with 
blocking of the humeral head and skin folds based on 
operative findings and judgment of the treating radiation 
oncologist. This field can be treated to a depth of 3-[ADDRESS_502180] is optional.

The chest wall will be contoured from the level of the diaphragm or from the level 2cm below the contralateral inframmary fold to the inferior aspect of the clavicular head with field edges extending from the midline to the mid-axillary line. Bolus will be required, either 1cm every other day or ½cm daily.  
If irradiated, the internal mammary lymph nodes should be contoured from the inferior chest wall field edge and include the medial supraclavicular region. These lymph nodes follow the contour of the internal mammary artery. They do not have to be intentionally treated. Axillary and

5.4.4 Reporting secondary primary cancers  
All cases of second primary cancers, including acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), that occur following treatment on NCI-sponsored trials must be reported to ECOG -ACRIN : 
• A second malignancy is a cancer that is UNRELATED to 
any prior anti-cancer treatment (including the treatment on 
this protocol). Second malignancies require ONLY routine 
reporting as follows:  
1. Submit a completed Second Primary Form within [ADDRESS_502194] [LOCATION_011], MA [ZIP_CODE] 
2. Submit a copy of the pathology report to ECOG -ACRIN 
confirming the diagnosis  
3. If the patient has been diagnosed with AML/MDS, submit a copy of the cytogenetics  report (if available) to ECOG -
ACRIN  
• A secondary malignancy is a cancer CAUSED BY [CONTACT_398585]-cancer treatment (including the treatment on this 
protocol).  Secondary malignancies require both routine 
and expedited reporting as follows: 
1. Submit a completed Second Primary Form within [ADDRESS_502195] 
[LOCATION_011], MA [ZIP_CODE] 
2. Report the diagnosis via CTEP -AERS  at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov

and NCI/CTEP confirming the diagnosis.  
4. If the patient has been diagnosed with AML/MDS, submit a 
copy of the cytogenetics report (if available) to ECOG -
ACRIN and NCI/CTEP.  
NOTE : The Second Primary Form and the CTEP-AERS  report 
should not be used to report recurrence or development of 
metastatic disease.  
NOTE:  If a patient has been enrolled in more than one NCI-sponsored study, the Second Primary Form must be submitted for the most recent trial. ECOG -ACRIN must be 
provided with a copy of the form and the associated pathology report and cytogenetics report (if available) even if ECOG -ACRIN  was not the patient's most recent trial.  
NOTE:  Once data regarding survival and remission status are no longer required by [CONTACT_760], no follow -up data should be 
submitted via CTEP -AERS  or by [CONTACT_394836].  
5.5 Supportive Care  
5.5.1 All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the study. Growth factor support while on cytotoxic chemotherapy is allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. 
5.6 Duration of Study Participation  
All patients will be followed until  progression and for survival. Those randomized 
to Early Local Therapy will receive protocol -specified surgery and radiation 
immediately after randomization. Study participation will continue for 5 years unless:  
5.6.1 Patient withdraws consent. 
5.6.2 Death. 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2108  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: March 10, [ADDRESS_502196] experienced disease 
progression since the start of systemic therapy, as evidenced by [CONTACT_398586] (see 3.1.4
 for definition of baseline evaluation) compared to 
equivalent tests performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization, 
including:  
[IP_ADDRESS] No new sites of disease  
[IP_ADDRESS] No enlargement of existing sites by 20% or more (sum of the longest diameter of measurable lesions)  
[IP_ADDRESS] No symptomatic deterioration, defined as a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression. Women whose loco-regional disease remains symptomatic at the end of induction therapy (i.e. ulcerations, skin nodules or pain from replacement of the breast with tumor or chest wall invasion) so that they 
require immediate local therapy for palliation are classified 
as having symptomati c deterioration and will not be 
randomized. They will be followed for survival.  
6.2 Changes in Disease Status on Step 2 
6.2.1 Local/Regional Assessment  
The breast as well as cervical, supraclavicular, infraclavicular and 
axillary lymph nodes and chest wall disease must be assessed. 
Breast evaluation will consist of:  
a) physical examination with complete documentation of the 
following: tumor in two longest dimensions; skin invasion (yes/no) skin ulceration (yes/no); tumor mobility (free/attached to 
fascia/chest wall fixation). 
b) Breast imaging studies with mammogram OR ultrasound OR 
breast MRI measurement are requested at baseline (see 3.1.4
 
and 7.1 for definition of baseline evaluation). However, if in the 
judgment of the physician, physical exam provides sufficient 
documentation of tumor size and T stage, and breast imaging 
has not been performed in the baseline period, the patient is still 
eligible. Preferably, the same imaging studies should be 
repeated in the pre-randomization interval (within 6 weeks prior to randomization).  If the same study cannot be repeated (e.g. 
insurance denial of MRI), an equivalent study (e.g. mammogram 
or ultrasound) may be performed.

breast is replaced by [CONTACT_398588] a way that makes breast imaging not feasible. If so, physical exam documentation must reflect this. A physical exam can only be used for pre- randomization evaluation of the breast if imaging is not feasible and tumor is 
palpable: in this case, physical exam findings describing the tumor must be documented. During follow -up breast imaging studies with 
mammogram OR ultrasound OR  MRI need to be performed.

Patients with controlled chest wall will be censored at the last date of 
evaluation.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_502212] not progressed during induction systemic therapy will be randomized between the two arms: Arm A 
(control: delayed palliative local therapy for symptomatic local progression) and 
Arm B (experimental: immediate local therapy). Randomization will be conducted 
using permuted blocks within strata with dynamic balanc ing within main 
institutions and their affiliate networks. Institutions obtain treatment assignments through the ECOG -ACRIN  web registration program. Patients who progress 
during induction systemic therapy will undergo therapy at their physician’s direction and will be monitored for local and distant events.  
8.4 Sample Size 
The primary comparison will be an intention-to-treat analysis including all randomized patients. It is expected that the three-year survival in the control arm will be 30%. The primary analysis of survival will be performed using a one-sided logrank test stratified on the stratification factors including marker status and 
treatment plan, number of involved organ systems, using an overall type I error of 
5%. Allowing for the interim analysis  plan discussed below, a total accrual of 186 
responders and a total information of 110 deaths is planned, to give 85% power Rev. 7/12

Cancer Research Grou p Version Date: March 10, [ADDRESS_502213] a 19.3% difference in the three-year survival rates (i.e., 49.3 % in the 
experimental arm). To allow for 15% probability of crossover between two arms 
(sum of the probabilities of patients on the experimental arm crossing over to the 
control arm and vice versa), both numbers are inflated by a factor of 1.38 (based on the Lachin-Foulkes correction)(53) to a total accrual of 2 58 responders and a 
total information of 152 deaths. Assuming an exponential distribution, this 
difference corresponds to an improvement in median survival from 21.4 to 33.5 
months. Assuming 70% of the recruited patients are eligible and responding, a 
total of 368 patients will be needed to accrue 258  responder s. Assuming an 
accrual rate of 6 patients per month, 62 months of accrual will be needed. The 
sample size was computed using seqopr6 (part of the study design library at the 
ECOG -ACRIN Statistical Office). 
8.5 Interim Monitoring and Analysis Plan  
Interim analyses of survival will be performed for all semi -annual DSMC meetings 
beginning when approximately 23 % of the planned full information ( 36 deaths) 
has been observed; continuing until either the criterion for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_398541]. To preserve the overall type I error rate, critical values at the interim analyses will be determined using a truncated version of the 
Lan-DeMets error spending function corresponding to the O’Br ien-Fleming 
boundary (54). Boundary values at a minimal significance less than .0005 will be 
truncated at .0005, with the boundary also adjusted to preserve the overall type I 
error rate of 5%. Under the accrual and death rate assumptions above, interim analyses would be expected to occur at 28, 34, 40, 46, 52, 58 and 64 months after activation, at information times of 23 %, 33 %, 43 %, 54 %, 65 %, 77%, 89% 
with a final analysis at approximately 70 months after activation at 100% of the information time. Due to delays in initiation of accrual and delays in data submission and processing, it is likely that the actual analysis times will be 6-12 months later. 
The study will also be monitored for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_398542]-Turnbull  repeated confidence interval (RCI) (52) methodology. At 
each interim analysis the RCI on the hazard ratio will be computed using the 
critical values from the error spending function. If this RCI does not include the target alternative hazard ratio of 1.57  (control/experimental), then the study 
would be stopped early for lack of benefit. The hazard ratio of 1.[ADDRESS_502214] of noncompliance based on Lachin- Foulkes‘ modified hazards (53)

analysis will be performed when approximately [ADDRESS_502215] randomization will also be compared using the two-point 
procedure described in Freidlin, Korn, and et. al.  (51). The fraction of

described below. Rev. 7/13, 4/14

51 8.6 HRQL Power Estimate and Analysis Plan 
Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) will be assessed using the FACT-B TOI, 
FACT -G, FACT Breast cancer subscale score and the additional items added to 
the Breast Cancer Subscale. The average total score for each scale will be 
recorded for both arms at baseline, randomization, six months post-randomization, [ADDRESS_502217]-randomization and their change over time will be compared using mixed effects models. More specifically, we will fit a model with treatment assignment, 
assessment time, treatment assignment by [CONTACT_398590]. If the interaction of treatment assignment and 
assessment time is significant, then the change of HRQL  over time would be 
different for the two arms.  This model also accommodates inter -patient variability 
by [CONTACT_398591]-specific regression lines. If there is high proportion of 
informative missingness in the HRQL data, we will analyze the data using the 
joint modeling of longitudinal data (here, HRQL) and survival time as described in 
Schluchter, 1992 and Schluchter, Greene and Beck, (55, 56). We will also test whether the HRQL increase or decrease from randomization to the time of decision for local therapy for the palliative local therapy arm, using a paired t test.  
The primary endpoint for HRQL is FACT-B TOI. Looking at FACT-B TOI data, using a 2-sided t test at level 0.2 0, there is 79% power to detect a difference of 
4.5 points between the two arms with SD 14 (from E2100), assuming 69% of responders who received assigned treatment ( 89 per arm) have HRQL data at [ADDRESS_502218] will be used to 
compare the two arms if the scores are not normally distributed. 
8.7 Correlative Science (CTC) Power estimate  
Two sample t-t est/Wilcoxon test will be conducted to test whether the CTC 
burden at 6 months after randomization will be lower in Arm B than in Arm A. Cox proportional hazards (PH) model will be used to examine whether patients with lower CTC burden at [ADDRESS_502219] prolonged survival. The 
treatment assignment, CTC burden or possibly their interaction will be included in the Cox PH model. 
Assuming 60% of the patients would provide their CTC at [ADDRESS_502220] 155 evaluable patients, with 77 patients per arm. 
Assuming the standardized difference is 0.339 (difference in mean/standard 
deviation; e.g. the difference in CTC at 6 months after randomization for the two 
arms is 1 and the SD is 3), then the given sample size will pr ovide 77% power 
using a two sample t test with two-sided significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_502221]/ Wilcoxon test would be used to test whether there is a reduction 
in CTC burden from randomization to [ADDRESS_502222]/Wilcoxon test would be used to test whether the reduction in 
CTC in Arm B is larger than Arm A.   A Cox PH model will be used to evaluate 
whether a larger reduction predicts longer survival. Rev. 7/13 Rev. 7/13  Rev. 4/14

The accrual targets in individual cells are not large enough for definitive treatment comparisons to be made within these subgroups. Therefore, overall accrual to the study will not be extended to meet individual subgroup targets.  
8.9 Compliance Monitoring 
The D SMC will monitor the compliance throughout the trial. If there is large 
deviation from the assumed compliance rate, i.e., the sum of the cross -over rates 
in either direction cross 15%, the design modification or early termination of the trial will be discussed at the D SMC meeting.  We would also consider a formal 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_398544] -over rate is higher than expected after recruiting [ADDRESS_502223] of the unexpected accumulative cross -over 
rate on the power. If the accumulative cross -over rate is higher than assumed, for 
example, 20%, then the power would be reduced to 82 %. A 30% rate yields a 
power as 71 %, which might be considered as acceptable.  In a more extreme 
case, if the rate reaches 50%, then the power would be only 46 %, which is too 
low to detect any benefit for the elective local therapy. On the other hand, if the accumulative cross -over rate is lower than assumed (15%), then we would gain 
more power with the current design. For example, if the rate is 10%, the power would increase to 89%.

9.4.2 Biopsy Reimbursements  
Additional research biopsies will be obtained from the primary tumor 
(Arm A only) and metastatic site (both Arms) at randomization, as well as in cases where the metastatic biopsy at study entry is not 
considered clinically necessary.  The biopsies are reimbursable up to 
a maximum of $[ADDRESS_502230] biopsy and $2,350 per metastatic biopsy.  Rev. 7/12

59 All sites are eligible for the reimbursement for the research biopsies 
regardless of cooperative group.  However, it is up to the site to set up 
the mechanism for the ‘billing’ of these biopsies.  ECOG -ACRIN  
recommends billing the cooperative group Principal Investigator (PI) 
of the site.  Contact [CONTACT_398596]’s operations office and ask to whom this account should be named 
Please note that blocks MUST  be submitted in order to receive the 
reimbursement. Since these biopsies are being performed strictly for 
the research for this trial, blocks are required to be submitted in order 
to receive the reimbursement. 
Prior to recruiting patients to the biopsy portion, the following 
conditions must be met: 
a.  The research rates of $[ADDRESS_502231] biopsy and $2,350 per 
metastatic biopsy are deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_398597]. 
b T he research rate is reported to the institution’s financial office 
and an account established in the institution’s cooperative group principal investigator’s name.  
c.  The patient provides written consent to undergo the additional biopsies.  
NOTE:  If the above rates are not accepted by [CONTACT_398598].  Expenses  for biopsies will be paid only to participating 
institutions, not to any other persons or entities, at the stated research 
rate of $[ADDRESS_502232] biopsy and $2,350 per metastatic biopsy . 
NOTE:  Neither patients nor their insurance companies are to be billed for the collection or submission of these research 
biopsy samples.  
Distribution of the reimbursements requires:  
• Submission of the requested biopsy samples using the ECOG -
ACRIN Sample Tracking System (STS) 
• Receipt and verification of the requested biopsy samples by [CONTACT_398599] -ACRIN  Central Biorepository and Pathology Facility  via the 
ECOG -ACRIN  STS.  (Refer to Section 9.3
 for STS requirements)  
• Receipt of E2108 Biopsy Reimbursement Form ( Appendix VII ) to 
the ECO G-ACRIN Operations Office - [LOCATION_011]. 
Reimbursements will be paid from the ECOG -ACRIN Operations 
Office - [LOCATION_011] to the ECOG- ACRIN Principal Investigator (PI) of the 
submitting ECOG -ACRIN institution.   
For sites whose accruals are credited to any other cooperative group (including the CTSU), the reimbursements will be routed through the respective group’s operations office.  ECOG -ACRIN  does not dictate Rev. 7/12

office to the site.  Please verify this internal billing mechanism with the 
appropriate operations office to determine the routing procedure. 
If your site is associated with more than one cooperative group, you 
will need to determine how your accruals to this trial are credited (e.g., if your site belongs to SWOG and CTSU and your accruals are credited as CTSU, then the CTSU PI [INVESTIGATOR_398555])

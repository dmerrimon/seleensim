2.1 Background
9.5 PharmacokineticsAddition to background:
Rodatristat ethyl is a prodrug for the active tryptophan 
hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) inhibitor rodatristat.  In vitro, 
nonclinical, and human pharmac okinetic (PK) studies to 
date have provided valuab le information on the PK 
properties of rodatristat et hyl and its active moiety, 
rodatristat. Rodatristat ethyl has low to moderate oral 
bioavailability in nonclinical  species and is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_321245]. Both rodatristat ethyl 
and rodatristat are highly protein bound and little is 
excreted in the urine.  Bilia ry excretion predominates in 
rats and no further metabolism of rodatristat has been detected in human hepatocyte preparations. However, 
preliminary investigations have also identified a 
metabolite, M15, in the plasma  of dogs and humans after 
administration of rodatrista t ethyl. After single-dose 
administration, the half-life of rodatristat ethyl and 
rodatristat are approximately [ADDRESS_396476] 
exposures achieved in healt hy subjects to date were 
reached on Day 7 following 800 mg twice daily (BID) 
doses of rodatristat ethyl.
Addition of M15 metabolite in PK section.A metabolite 
profiling study 
performed in dogs led to the 
identification of 
an additional major 
metabolite, M15, 
in plasma after the start of this 
study.  Blood for 
PK samples will analyze for M15 
in addition to 
rodatristat ethyl and rodatristat.
4.5 Criteria for Study TerminationAdditional wording in Section 4.5:
The study may resume once concerns about safety, 
protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed and the IRBs/ECs and co mpetent authorities are 
satisfied. The study will only resume after prior submission and approval of the substantial amendment (if required) by [CONTACT_93434].Clarification of

thermodilution is not available) Method -Thermodilution is the pr eferred method for the 
estimation of cardiac output. At least 3 determinations that are within 10% variability of one another must be measured. Measurements must be repeated until this  reliability is met. The 
mean cardiac output will be defined as the average of these [ADDRESS_396490] of

Rationale:
Rodatristat ethyl is an orally bi oavailable prodrug that is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y converted to the active tryptophan 
hydroxylase (TPH) inhibitor rodatristat in the systemic  circulation of multiple nonclinical species and 
humans. The clinical doses and regimens selected for this study have been selected with the goal to 
achieve optimal rodatristat exposure and serotonin (5 HT ) lowering targets associated with efficacy in 
nonclinical models of pulmonary arterial hype rtension (PAH) and pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) data in healthy subjects.
Objectives
Primary Objective:
xTo evaluate the effect of rodatristat ethyl on the percent change from baseline of pulmonary 
vascular resistance (PVR), as measured by [CONTACT_137910] (RHC) in patients 
with PAH

ConfidentialDuration of Treatment and Length of Study:
The treatment duration will be [ADDRESS_396538] up to 32 weeks in duration for patients 
completing the study that do not enroll into the OLE:
xScreening period: up to 28 days
xFixed dose treatment period (including Baseline): 24 weeks
xSafety Follow-Up Visit: [ADDRESS_396539] udy are met, IP becomes commerci ally available, or the Sponsor 
stops the study for lack of effica cy or a safety signal (whichever  preceding criteria comes first). 
In no case will a patient be allowed to exceed  [ADDRESS_396540], Dosage , and Mode of Administration:
Patients will be enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment arms in  a 1:1:1 randomization, with 30 patients per arm, 
receiving placebo or IP, taken with food for 24 weeks as follows:  
xRodatristat ethyl 300 mg + matching place bo BID (1 x 300 mg + 1 x placebo BID)
xRodatristat ethyl 600 mg BID (2 x 300 mg BID)
xMatching placebo BID (2 x placebo BID)
In order to maintain the study blind, all patients will receive 2 tablets of either rodatristat ethyl and/or 
placebo in the morning and in the evening in one of the combinations noted above.
Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations  will be allowed to manage adverse events 
(AEs)/Adverse events of special interest (AESIs), in cluding gastrointestinal AEs (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, 
or vomiting) and liver enzyme elevations occurri ng during the 24-week treatment period.  Use of 
antidiarrheal and/or anti-emetic medications will  be permitted as directed by [CONTACT_737].
Patients randomized to a rodatristat ethyl arm in  the Main Study may continue at the dose level given 
during the Main Study in the OLE.  Patients random ized to placebo in the Main Study will be re-
randomized to one of the active rodatristat ethyl treatment arms (300 mg BID or 600 mg BID) during 
the OLE. Changing of treatment for all patients in the OLE, to receive either 300 mg BID or 600 mg 
BID, could depend on the timing and outcome of th e 24-week analysis from the Main Study.  
Tolerability and all accumulated safety and efficacy  data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_115376] (IDMC)  at regular intervals.
Non-Investigational Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]:
Patients will remain on their prescribed, pre-existin g background PAH medications; doses of these 
medications should remain stable during the study.  All treatment modifications (changes in dose or 
regimen) will be documented.
Any changes to background PAH therapy during th e study should be based on clear medical need and 
should be first discussed with the Medical Monitor whenever possible.

ConfidentialStatistical methods:
A detailed description of statistical methods will be provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) that will be finalized prior to database lock.
Sample Size Justification:
The planned sample size is 90 patients with 30 patient s to be randomized into 1 of the 3 treatment arms 
in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_396541] 80% power at a 
significance level of 0.05 (2-sided hypothesis) to de tect a treatment difference of 0.[ADDRESS_396542] 
deviation (SD) in the percentage change of PVR from baseline between an active arm and the placebo 
arm. For example, if the SD for PVR percent change from baseline is 24%, the study has 80% power to 
detect a difference of 18% between an active arm and the placebo arm.
Analysis Populations:Intent-to-Treat (ITT): All patients randomized into the study.  For all summaries based on the ITT 
population, patients will be assigned to the tr eatment arm to which they were randomized.
Safety: The Safety Population will consist of all patien ts who are randomized and received at least one 
dose of study medication. For all summaries based on th e safety population, patients will be assigned to 
the treatment arm corresponding to the dose they had received.
Modified Intent-to-Treat (m-ITT):  All Safety population patients that had an evaluable baseline and 
at least [ADDRESS_396543]-baseline PVR measurement.
Per Protocol (PP): All m-ITT population patients who had no major protocol deviations.
Pharmacokinetic:
All Safety Population patients with rodatris tat ethyl or rodatristat concentration data.
Efficacy Analysis:Primary efficacy analyses will be perf ormed using the m-I TT and PP populations.
Percent change from baseline in PVR will be analyzed  using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with 
baseline PVR as the covariate. Additional baseline characteristics may also be evaluated as 
covariates in the model. The estimated between-treatment differences, 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) and p-values will be presented. For patients who discontinue from the study early, the last 
observation carried forward method will be used to impute the PVR at Week 24.
Secondary efficacy analyses will be perfor med using the m-ITT and PP populations:
xChange in cardiac index, mPAP, mRAP, SvO2 at rest and PAC from baseline 
xTime to Clinical Worsening
xDeath from any cause
xChange in WHO FC from baseline
xChange in 6MWD from baseline 
xChange in NT-proBNP from baseline
xChanges in right atrial size & RV function: TAPSE, tricuspid annular systolic velocity, and
RV fractional area change from baseline
xChange in PAH-SYMPACT from baseline 
xChange in the REVEAL Lite 2 score
xChange in 5-HIAA (plasma an d spot urine concentration)

[ADDRESS_396544], randomization stratum and baseline assessment as covariates.  The estimated between treatment differences, 95% CIs and p-values will be presented.
The change in 6MWD from baseline will also be compared between groups using non-parametric 
analysis of covariance within the framework of the extended Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test.  For 
endpoints measured over time, a mixed effect of repeated measure model ma y be used as sensitivity 
analyses.  Details of statistical methods will be provided in the SAP.
The time from the first dose of IP
until to the first clinical worsening event will be  summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and 
compared between treatment groups using the log-rank test.
Safety Analysis:
A summary of rodatristat exposure will be perform ed using the safety population.  The safety and 
tolerability of rodatristat ethyl will be  evaluated by [CONTACT_321307], vital signs measurements, ECG tr acings, and the use of concomitant medication during 
the study. Adverse events (AEs) will be mapped to a Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA)-preferred term and system organ classifi cation. The occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_39815] p using MedDRA preferred terms, system organ 
classifications, and severity. Separate summaries of  treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) 
and AEs considered to be related to IP will be ge nerated. All AEs will be lis ted for individual patients
showing both verbatim and preferre d terms. Descriptive summaries of vital signs, ECG parameters, and 
clinical laboratory results will be prese nted by [CONTACT_126215].
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis:
A population PK approach will be utilized to characteri ze the PK of rodatristat ethyl and rodatristat.  A 
detailed description of the PK and any PK/PD analysis  methods used will be provided in the separate 
analysis plan.
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics: 
Demographic and baseline characteristics for the ITT population will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics.
Other Analyses:
Patient Reported Outcomes (C-SSRS, HADS and QI DS-C), PK concentration data , PD, and exploratory 
descriptive analyses will be described in the SAP finalized before database lock.
Independent Data Mo nitoring Committee:
The primary role of the IDMC which consists of inde pendent physicians with experience in the care of 
patients with PAH and the conduct of randomized cont rolled trials, and one non-vo ting biostatistician, is 
to ensure the safety of the patients enrolled in the study/OLE. A detailed description of IDMC 
procedures is provided in a separate data mon itoring committee charter maintained by [CONTACT_1034].

Confidential 2. INTRODUCTION
2.1. Background
Pulmonary arterial hypertensi on (PAH) is a severe, incura ble disease characterized by 
[CONTACT_321308], leading to elevations  in resting mean pulmonary artery 
pressures, subsequent right ventricular hypert rophy, and eventually, ri ght heart failure and 
(Agarwal & Gomberg-Maitland, 2011 ).  Current standard-of-care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321263] 
3 different pathways – namely, the endothelin- [ADDRESS_396560] – and act primarily as vasodilators.  They reduce PAH symptoms and may 
slow disease progression, but they lack  compelling disease-modifying properties.
Several lines of evidence implicate sero tonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) in the 
pathophysiology of PAH where there are findings that  5-HT plasma levels are markedly elevated 
in PAH ( Humbert et al., 2002 ); tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) 1, th e key rate-limiting enzyme in 
the biosynthesis of systemic  5-HT, is overexpressed in lung tissue of PAH patients 
(Eddahibi, 2006 ), and 5-HT acts on pulmonary artery  smooth muscle cells to induce 
vasoconstriction and proliferation ( MacLean & Dempsie, 2010 ).  In addition, 5-HT acts at the 
5-HT1B receptor and the 5-HT transporter to  mediate constriction and proliferation of 
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells ( MacLean & Dempsie, 2010 ).  Finally, genetic deletion 
and pharmacological inhibition of TPH1 protects against the development of experimentally 
induced PAH ( Abid et al., 2012; Izikki et al., 2007 ) in nonclinical pharmacology models.  In 
aggregate, these findings indica te that modulation of the 5-HT  pathway by [CONTACT_321309]1 inhibition is a 
novel approach that differentiate s itself mechanistically from cu rrent therapeutic options and 
offers the potential to  modify the underlying disease pathophysiology and progression of PAH
(Aiello et al., 2016; MacLean, 2018 ). 
A therapeutic strategy is needed to safely and effectively inhibit TPH1 activity in peripheral 
tissues, without unwanted central nervous system (CNS) effects th at result from inhibition of 
TPH2, the predominant TPH isoform in the CNS. 
Rodatristat ethyl is a peripherall y restricted TPH1/TPH2 inhibito r with little CNS penetration. 
Nonclinical data indicate that ne ither rodatristat ethyl nor rodatr istat cross the bl ood brain barrier 
to a pharmacologically relevant  level and do not lower brain levels of 5-HT in nonclinical 
pharmacodynamic studies in rats.  By [CONTACT_321310]1 in the periphery, rodatristat 
ethyl may avoid potential untow ard CNS effects that could ot herwise be a consequence of 
inhibiting TPH2-mediated CNS 5-HT production ( Kim et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2008 ). 
Rodatristat ethyl is a prodrug that  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_321264], a potent TPH inhibitor that 
reduces peripheral 5-HT levels in the gut mucosa, lung, and serum in animal models of PAH.  In 
vitro, nonclinical, and human pha rmacokinetic (PK) studies to date have provided valuable 
information on the PK properties of  rodatristat ethyl and its active moiety, rodatristat. Rodatristat 
ethyl has low to moderate oral bioavailability in nonclinical speci es and is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_321265].  Both roda tristat ethyl and roda tristat are highly prot ein bound and little is 
excreted in the urine.  Biliary  excretion predominates in ra ts and no furthe r metabolism of 
rodatristat has been detected in human hepatocyte preparations. However, preliminary 
investigations have also identi fied a metabolite, M 15, in the plasma of dogs and humans after 

[ADDRESS_396561] exposures achieved in 
healthy subjects to date were reached on Day 7 following 800 mg twice daily (BID) doses of 
rodatristat ethyl.
Rodatristat ethyl was selected fo r development in the treatment of PAH based on a range of 
criteria, including achieving efficacy endpoint s in nonclinical in vivo models of PAH, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, and biomarker endpoints related to both changes in systemic 
5-HT levels and PAH pathology. 
Reductions in biomarkers  indicative of decreased 5-HT bios ynthesis were observed in healthy 
subjects receiving repeat twice daily (BID) oral doses (range 100 to 800 mg BID) of rodatristat 
ethyl over [ADDRESS_396562] efficacy for PAH.  Re sults from nonclinical pharmacology 
studies demonstrate that rodatris tat ethyl is a potent and selective inhibitor of TPH1 with the 
potential to ameliorate disease by [CONTACT_321311].  Th rough inhibition of TPH1, rodatrista t ethyl is expected to improve 
cardiopulmonary hemodyna mics, functional capacity, PAH sy mptoms, and right ventricular 
(RV) function via its novel antiproliferative and anti-re modeling mechanism of action.
This study will evaluate rodatristat ethyl doses of 300 mg BID and 600 mg BID. Dose selection 
was guided by [CONTACT_321312] a dose/exposure efficacy relationship and was 
supported by [CONTACT_321313], toxicology, and animal model efficacy data. Results 
from Phase [ADDRESS_396563] ug exposure.  Further details 
regarding the dose rationale can be found in Section 4.7.
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
Summaries of findings from both clinical and nonclinical studies conducted with r odatristat ethyl
as well as more detailed information about th e known and expected benefits and risks and 
reasonably expected adverse events (AEs) of rodatr istat ethyl may be found in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  This section outlines the potential adve rse events of special interest (AESI; based 
either on preclinical or clinical data generated to date, the mechanism of action of rodatristat 
ethyl, or the prescribing information for telotris tat ethyl [a TPH inhibitor previously approved for 
the treatment of carcinoid syndrome-related diar rhea] and mitigation strate gies for this protocol.
The potential risk for QTc prolongation (described in the Investigator’s Br ochure) will be further 
evaluated in a definitive thorough QT study in the future. Until furthe r data are available in that 
regard, cardiac arrhythmia, related to an increas e in QT/QTc interval, will be treated as a 
potential AESI and has therefore also been incl uded in the table of potential risks below. 
Although any potential benefits to patients w ith PAH will not be known until the study is 
completed, the development of a drug with disease- modifying potential will certainly be of value 
to patients with this diagnosis.

In order to maintain the study bli nd, patients will take 2 tablets in the morning and 2 tablets in 
the evening in one of the combinations noted above.
4.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria
4.4.1. Dose Reduction
All determinations of rodatris tat ethyl dose reduction should be  discussed with the Medical 
Monitor prior to implementing unless time does not allow for safety.
Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations  will be allowed to manage AEs/AESIs (or 
other instances to be discussed with the Me dical Monitor), including gastrointestinal AEs
(e.g., diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting) or liver enzyme increase occurring during the 24 weeks of 
the study.  Judicious use of antidiarrheal and/or  anti-emetic medications  will be permitted. One 
level of dose reduction is available.
To reduce the IP, the patient will be instructed to ta ke one tablet in the mo rning and one tablet in 
the evening from the appropriate dispensed bot tles during the dose reduc tion period per dosing 
instructions supplied in a sepa rate document.  If AEs continue, the patient may stop taking the IP
completely for up to 7 days before restarting.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Diarrhea
In the event the patient experiences dia rrhea, the dose may be reduced. The Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v ersion 4.0 grading will be used to grade the 
severity of all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) of diarrhea. Management 
recommendations for diarrhea are based on the CTCAE grades and are detailed in Appendix 2.
In general, the patient should be treated with anti-d iarrheal drugs such as loperamide as clinically 
indicated. In addition to direc tly treating any diarrhea, possibl e intermittent or permanent 
interruption of IP and dose reduction will be possible, de pending upon the frequency and 
severity of diarrhea.

4.7. Justification for Dose
The dose levels selected are based on prior pharmacodynamic (PD) observa tions in nonclinical 
models of PAH and PK, PD, safety, and tolerability data in healthy subjects  receiving rodatristat 
ethyl for up to 14 days.
Disease-modifying effects of rodatristat ethyl were demonstr ated in the semaxanib (SU5416, 
SUGEN) hypoxia and the monocrotalin e (MCT) injury rat models of PAH.  In the MCT rat 
model, rodatristat ethyl decreased serum and lung 5-HT levels and reduced the extent of vascular 
remodeling. In the SU5416 hypoxia rat model, ro datristat ethyl signi ficantly reduced RV
systolic pressure, RV hypertrophy, the biomarker brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and pulmonary 
vessel wall thickness and occlusions as measured  by [CONTACT_321316], without impacting 
systolic blood pressure (SBP). These benefits were observed at GRVHVRI  100 mg/kg, which 
results in approximately a 40% re duction in 5-HT biosynthesis ( IB, 2020 ). Based on these data,
a target reduction in 5-HT (as determined by [CONTACT_321317] 5-HIAA excretion rate ) of at least 40% was 
the basis for the doses selected in the current study.
After 14 day BID administration to  healthy subjects, rodatristat ethyl at doses of 400 to 800 mg 
BID resulted in 50 to 60% reductions in urin ary 5-HIAA.  Dose-dependent increases in 
gastrointestinal treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs; notably nausea and diarrh ea) were noted with 
rodatristat ethyl, including an event of modera te diarrhea and an overa ll incidence rate of 
44% after administration of 800 mg BID ( IB, 2020 ).  Therefore, the highest dose regimen 
selected for the current study is rodatristat et hyl [ADDRESS_396579] while minimizing potential of gastrointestinal TEAEs.
The lower dose regimen of rodatr istat ethyl of 300 mg BID was sele cted to evaluate a lower dose 
to aid in defining potential dose-re sponse relationships and is expected to result in approximately 
40% reduction in 5-HIAA, equivalent to the re ductions observed at efficacious doses in 
nonclinical models ( IB, 2020 ). 

histopathologic findings of intestinal dilation with vac uolated macrophages, and increased 
mucosal thickness with regenerati on in the duodenum.  Observed liver enzyme elevations were 
not associated with adverse histopathology (h epatocellular necrosis ) and are considered 
monitorable.
Prior studies have demonstrated coadministra tion of rodatristat ethy l with food can increase 
systemic exposure of ro datristat ethyl and rodatristat from 1.1- to 1.8-fold.  Thus, the prior

(IB, 2020 ).  To maintain consistency with these studi es and therefore the expected PD effects, IP
will be administered BID with a standard meal.
Taken together, the nonclinical ph armacology and safety data, and pr ior clinical experience with 
rodatristat ethyl support the low and high BI D dose regimens (300 mg and 600 mg) to be 
evaluated in patients with PAH over the 24-week treatment period.
4.8. End of Study Definition
A patient is considered to have completed t he study if he/she has completed 24 weeks of 
treatment including the Week 24 visit and the Follow-up Visit (for patients that complete the study through Week 24 but decide not to rollover to the OLE), or the last scheduled procedureshown in the Schedule of Assessments(SoA; Section 1.3).   If the patient decides to continue 
into the OLE, subject must not participate in another interventional study until completing theET/final follow-up visit ([ADDRESS_396582] dose of study drug) according to the Schedule of Assessments OLE (Section 1.4or1.5).
The end of the study for assessment of the primary endpoint is defined as the date of the last visit 
of the last patient in the Main Study or last scheduled procedure in the Main Study shown in the 
SoA for the last patient in the study globally, regardless of dura tion of participation in the OLE.

Screen failures are defined as patients who consen t to participate in the clinical study but are not 
subsequently randomized into the study. After ob taining informed consent, study site personnel 
will enter the patient into the Interactive Res ponse Technology (IRT), and the patient will be 
assigned a unique patient number. The IRT should be updated promptly for patients who do not 
meet the criteria for participation in  the study (screen failure) and reason.
A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transp arent reporting of screen 
failure patients to meet the C onsolidated Standards of Reporti ng Trials (CONSORT) publishing
requirements and to respond to que ries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information is to be 
entered into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC ), including demography, sc reen failure details,

conditions have been maintained during trans it for all IP recei ved and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the IP.
2. Only patients enrolled in the study may rece ive IP. Accurate records must be kept of 
when and how much IP is dispensed and admin istered to each patient in the study.  Any 
reason for departure from the in structions provided in the pr otocol for dispensing of IP 
must also be recorded.  IP may be supplied at  the site, from the site to the patient via a 
Sponsor-approved courier comp any, or from the depot dir ectly to the patient where 
allowed by [CONTACT_321321].
3. All IP at a study site must be stored in  a secure, environmentally controlled, and

Patients should return all IP (including empty, partial, and full bottles) at their regularly 
scheduled clinic visits.  Reconc iliation of all IP that was dispensed, returned, or lost must be 
accounted for with documentation for any IP that was lost or missing.
Returned IP may be re-issued if the patient is continuing in the study, returned to the drug depot,
or destroyed at the site as long as the site  has procedures in place for IP destruction where
allowed by [CONTACT_427]. Otherwise, all retu rned IP will be returned to the depot at

6.4. Measures to Minimize Bias : Randomization and Blinding
This is a double-blind study. The Sponsor, Investig ator, patient, and study site personnel will be 
blinded to all treatment group assignments. The I nvestigator will have th e ability, in the IRT 
system, to unblind a patient, and the decision will reside solely with the Investigator. Prior to 
unblinding, if safety allows, the I nvestigator should contact [CONTACT_321295].
Eligible patients will be stra tified during the rand omization process based on the number of 
background PAH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321274] (1, 2 or 3) and selexipag use. The number of 
patients who are receiving a prostanoid infusion will be capped at 50% of the total number of patients enrolled. The number of patients who are receiving selexipag will  be capped at 20% of 
the total number of patients enrolled. Patients w ill be randomized 1:1:[ADDRESS_396602] comple ted the Main Study and 
the database is locked.
At the time of randomization, in the Main Study, patients will be assigned a randomization 
number.  Once this number has been as signed, it cannot be reused/reassigned.
At the time of re-randomiza tion in the OLE, patients will be assigned a new randomization 
number.  Once this number has been a ssigned, it cannot be reused/reassigned.

ConfidentialBlind Break 
(IVRS/IWRS)The Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)
will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions.  Only in case of an emergency, when knowledge of the IP is essential for the clinical  management or welfare of a specific patient, 
may the Investigator unblind a patient’s treatment assignment in IVRS/IWRS.  The 
Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a patient’s treatment 
assignment is warranted.  Patient safety must always be the first consideration in making 
such a determination.  If the Investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the 
Investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_27464] a patient’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the patient.  If a 
patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours 
after breaking the blind without revealing the patient’s study treatment assignment (unless 
important to the safety of patients in the study) and that the Investigator was unable to 
contact [CONTACT_27464].  The date and reason that the blind was broken must 
be recorded in the source documentation and electronic case report form (eCRF), as 
applicable.

[ADDRESS_396637] a patient’s b lood sample taken at the Baselin e/Day1 and the Week 24 visits for 
pharmacogenetic markers that may be predictive of the natural histor y of the disease, response to 
therapy and tolerability of thera py. If it is not collected at the Baseline/Day 1 visit, it may be 
collected at any time during the treatment period.  Providing th ese blood samples is optional and 
not required for participation in the study.
9.2.7. Optional Blood Sample for Future Research
In addition to the study-specific informed consent to be signed by [CONTACT_321336], a separate, specific si gnature will be required to docu ment a patient’s agreement to 
provide additional samples or to  allow the use of the remainder of their already collected 
biomarker specimens for optional non-genetic futu re research, once approved by [CONTACT_321337].  The specimens collect ed for optional future 
research will be used to increase our knowledge  and understanding of th e biology pathogenesis, 
progression and/or treatment outcomes, including efficacy, AE s, and the process of drug 
absorption and disposition.  
A plasma sample will be obtained from all patients at the Day 1/Ba seline visit and at the end of 
the treatment or ET (as applicable) visit of the Main Study for future  research use.  Samples will 
be collected and archived by [CONTACT_321338] 10 years.
9.2.8. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring
Rodatristat ethyl acts to decrea se peripheral 5-HT levels and it was designed to not cross the 
blood-brain barrier; therefore, CN S 5-HT levels are not expected to be significantly impacted.
However, patients being treated with IP should be  monitored appropriately  and observed closely 
for suicidal ideation and behavior  or any other unusual changes in  behavior, especially at the 
beginning and end of the course of  treatment, or at the time of dos e changes, either increases or 
decreases. IP in patients who experience signs of  suicidal ideation or behavior following a risk 
assessment (see Section 8.1) must be stopped.
Screening and Baseline assessments ( within 1 month) of su icidal ideation and behavior as well as 
potential treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behavior will be monitored during the study 
using the C-SSRS.
Suicidal ideation and behavior as well as mood a nd anxiety assessments, as detailed below, will 
be obtained at time points indi cated in the SoA in (Section 1.3).

Confidential [IP_ADDRESS]. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The C-SSRS is a valid, reliable, evidenced-based suicidal ideation and be havior rating scale,
which was developed by [CONTACT_321339], including Columbia University with National 
Institute of Mental Health support,  to evaluate suicide risk ( CLP, 2016 ).  The
rater-/clinician-administered versio ns of the C-SSRS for research assess severity and intensity of 
suicidal ideation, types of suicidal  behaviors, and lethality of suic ide attempts at time points and 
over time periods that are t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_321279]. The C-SSRS has been 
identified by [CONTACT_1622] ( FDA, 2012 ) as acceptable for use in clinical  research and has been used 
extensively in clinical studies throughout the U.S. and around the world. 
Training should be completed by [CONTACT_321340].  Online 
training is available, and a certificate of completion is issued once the training is completed and must be filed at the site.  Tr aining must be current within th e previous 2 years. The sign-up and 
training portal can be found at the following link:

(7 items) and anxiety (7 items) disorders among nonpsychiatric, medically ill, outpatient 
populations ( Zigmond & Snaith, 1983 ).  As a screening instrume nt, the HADS does not provide 
a definitive diagnosis, but is the first step in a multistage process of selecting individuals at 
elevated risk for disorder to be evaluated through clinical interview.
An example of the HADS can be found in Appendix 11.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Quick Inventory of De pressive Symptomatology 
The 16-item QIDS ( Rush et al., 2003 ) is designed to assess the se verity of depressive symptoms. 
The QIDS is available in the clinician-rated ( QIDS-C) and self-reported versions (QIDS-SR). 
Both versions assess all the criterion symptom domains designated by [CONTACT_321341] - 4th edition (DSM-IV)
(APA, 1994 ) and the 5th edition adds reference to diagnose a majo r depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The 
QIDS-C version will be used in this study.  The QIDS-C is sensit ive to change with medications, 
psychotherapy, or somatic treatments,  making it useful for both rese arch and clinical purposes.  
The psychometric properties of the QIDS-C have been estab lished in various study samples.
An example of the QIDS-C can be found in Appendix 12.

Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 14 .
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_102] (or, when a ppropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
patient’s legally authorized representative).
The Investigator and any qualified designees ar e responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for follow up
of AEs that are serious, considered related to the IP or study procedures, or that caused the 
patient to discontinue the study (see Appendix 14 ).
9.3.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest
AESIs include:
ЬSevere constipation (and/or severe, pers istent, or worsening abdominal pain)
ЬDepression/other significant mood-related disturbance (active suicidal ideation or 
behavior, severe depressive and/or anxious symptoms, othe r severe psychiatric TEAE)
ЬElevations in hepatic enzymes (see Appendix 3 )
ЬDiarrhea (see Appendix 2 )
9.3.2. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event, Adverse Events of 
Special Interest, Serious Adverse Event Information
All SAEs will be collected from the signing of  the ICF until the Follow-Up Visit at the time
points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). All AEs will be collected from the first dose of IP.
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of IP but after obtaining in formed consent will be 
recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical  Conditions section of the eCRF not the AE 
section.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to th e Sponsor or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed [ADDRESS_396639] be reported to the Sponso r should they meet the 
definition of an SAE, and a ll timelines for repor ting of SAEs should be adhered to.
Investigators are not obligate d to actively seek AEs or SA Es after conclusion of study 
participation. However, if the Investigator lear ns of any SAE, includ ing a death, at any time 
after a patient has been discharg ed from the study, and he/she  considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the IP or study participatio n, the Investigator mu st promptly notify the

Serious Adverse Events
The method of recording, evaluating, and a ssessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and tran smitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 14 .
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when  detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of  the patient is the preferre d method to inquire about AE
occurrences.
9.3.4. Follow-up of Adverse Events, Adverse Ev ents of Special Interest, and Serious 
Adverse Events
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactivel y follow each patient at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non-serious AESIs (as defined in Section 9.3.1 ), will 
be followed until resolution, stabi lization, the event is otherwise e xplained, or the patient is lost 
to follow up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow- up procedures is given in
Appendix [ADDRESS_396641] igator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsib ilities towards the safety of patients and the safety of an IP
under clinical inve stigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulator y authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of an IP under clinical inves tigation. The Sponsor will 
comply with country-specific regulatory requi rements relating to safety reporting to the 
regulatory authority, IRBs/IECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must  be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) according to local regulatory require ments and Sponsor policy and forwarded to 
investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report desc ribing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SA Es) from the Sponsor will re view and then file 
it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will  notify the IRB/IEC, if  appropriate, according 
to local requirements.
9.3.6. Pregnancy
Patients will be instructed that if they/their part ner become pregnant durin g the study, this should 
be reported to the Investigator. The Investigator  should also be notified of any pregnancy that 
occurs during the study but not confirmed until after completion of th e study for at least 
5 terminal half-lives (4 weeks) after the last dose. In the event that a patient/patient’s partner is subsequently found to be pregnant  after being included in the st udy, then consent will be sought 
from the partner and, if granted, any pregnancy w ill be followed, and the status of the mother 
and/or child will be reported to the Sponsor after delivery.

ConfidentialAny patient reporting a pregnancy during the study will be discontinued from the IP. The patient
will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of 
the mother and child will be forwarded to th e Sponsor. Generally, follow up will be no longer 
than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated deliver y date. Any premature termination of the 
pregnancy will be reported. Abnormal pregnanc y outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal 
death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4 .
9.4. Treatment of Overdose
Prior to this study, there has been no experience with rodatristat ethyl in patients with PAH. In 
healthy subjects, no safety concerns were id entified following single doses ranging from 100 mg 
to 2000 mg or following repeat dosing over 14 da ys of up to 800 mg administered BID or up to 
800 mg administered once daily (QD).
An overdose in this study is defined as a dose > 1200 mg on any single dosing occasion, or 
> 2400 mg in any 24-hour period.
Altavant Sciences GmbH does not recomm end specific treatment for an overdose.
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator should:
1. Contact [CONTACT_27465]
2. Closely monitor the patient for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities as applicable
3. Obtain an unscheduled plasma sample fo r PK analysis if requested by [CONTACT_22955] (determined on a case-by-case basis)
4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as  well as the duration of the overdose in the 
eCRF

A detailed description of statistical methods will  be provided in a separa te Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) and the SAP will be fina lized prior to database lock.
10.1. Statistical Hypotheses
No formal hypotheses are planned for the study.
10.2. Sample Size Determination
The sample size for this study was not based on a formal hypothesis testing. It is expected that 
30 patients per arm will provide sufficient da ta to assess the safety and efficacy. Power 
calculations were conducted to examine the pr obability of detecting a difference among 
treatment groups for th e percentage change of PVR from baseline.
A sample size of 90 patients with 30 patients to be  randomized into 1 of the 3 treatment arms in a 
1:1:[ADDRESS_396644] 
80% power at a significance level of 0.05 (2-sided hypothesis) to de tect a treatment difference of 
0.[ADDRESS_396645] deviation (SD) in the percentage change from baseline of PVR from 
baseline between an active arm and the placebo arm. If the SD for PVR percent change is 24%, 
the study has 80% power to detect a differenc e of 18% between an active arm and the placebo 
arm.
10.3. Populations for Analyses
For purposes of analysis, the fo llowing populations are defined:
Population Description
Enrolled All patients who sign the ICF
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) All patients randomized into the study. For all summaries based 
on the ITT population, patients w ill be assigned to the treatment 
arm to which they were randomized.
Modified Intent-to-Treat (m-ITT): All safety population patients th at had an evaluable baseline
and completed at least [ADDRESS_396646]-baseline efficacy assessment.Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment theyactuall
yreceived.
Per Protocol (PP) All m-ITT population patients who had no major protocol

female partner who becomes pregnant while the male patient is in this study. This 
applies only to male patients who receive the investigational product.
xAfter obtaining the necessary signed inform ed consent from the pregnant female 
partner directly, the Investigator will record pregnanc y information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to the Sponsor within  24 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the 
Sponsor. Generally, the follow up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless 
of fetal status (presence or absence of a nomalies) or indication for the procedure.
Female Patients who become pregnant
xThe Investigator will coll ect pregnancy information on any female patient who 
becomes pregnant while participating in th is study. Information will be recorded on 
the appropriate form and s ubmitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a 
patient's pregnancy.
xThe patient will be followed to determin e the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will collect follow-up information on the patient and the neonate, and the 
information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow up will not be 
required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.
xWhile pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event (AE) or serious 
adverse event (SAE), any pregnancy comp lication or elective termination of a 
pregnancy will be reported as an AE or  SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always 
considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any poststudy

ConfidentialStudy and Site Closure
The Sponsor’s designee reserves the right to clos e the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required docum ents and study supplies 
have been collected and a study-site  closure visit has been performed.
The Investigator may init iate study-site closure at any time , provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor or Investigator may include but are 
not limited to:
xFailure of the Investigator to comply w ith the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, th e Sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines
xInadequate recruitment of pa tients by [CONTACT_321355]. If this 
is foreseen, the Investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the 
Sponsor before submission. This allows  the Sponsor to protect proprietary 
information and to provide comments.
xThe Sponsor will comply with the requir ements for publication of study results. In 
accordance with standard editorial and ethi cal practice, the Sponsor will generally 
support publication of multicenter studies only in their entire ty and not as individual

ConfidentialTesting Conditions:
xThe patient should sit at rest in a chair, lo cated near the starting position, for at least 
[ADDRESS_396667] importance that the eligibility tests 
(Screening and Baseline) and all follow ing 6MWTs are performed under the same 
conditions:
RThe same tester should ad minister the 6MWT for a given patient throughout the trial 
whenever possible
RThe same time of day for conducting the 6MWT for a given patient should be used 
whenever possible to minimize intra-day variability
RPatients who used walking aids at the eligibility tests (Screening and Baseline,
e.g., cane or walker) need to use the same  walking aids at every subsequent 6MWT
xSite staff will need to document if a walking aid (and what type) was used at
each test, if applicable
xIf the patient
normally requires supplemental oxy gen when walking, then the test should be 
performed on the patient’s “usual” walking oxyg en flow rate at Ba seline and during all 
subsequent 6MWTs whenever possible.  If the patient usually breathes room air while 
walking, they should perfor m the test on room air.
RPatients who add supplemental oxygen after the Baseline Visit s hould walk without 
oxygen during subsequent walk tests when ever possible so that data will be 
comparable to baseline conditions. However, if this is not possible (from a patient 
safety perspective) then the 6MWT may be conducted with the supplemental oxygen 
and this should be noted in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
RFor patients on supplemental oxygen at Baseline, if the oxygen flow rate must beincreased during the trial due to wors ening gas exchange, 6MWTs should be 
conducted using the same oxygen flow rate that was used at the Baseline Visit 
whenever possible.  However, if this is not possible (from a patient safety 
perspective) then the 6MWT may be conducte d at the increased flow rate and this 
should be noted in the eCRF.
RIf the patient reduces or discontinues supplemental oxygen use during the study, the 
patient should still perform th e 6MWT with the same oxygen flow rate that was used 
at the Baseline Visit.
Instructions for the Patient and Test Administrator:
xA “warm-up” period should not be  performed before the test
xSet the lap counter to zero and the timer to 6 minutes.  Assemble all necessary equipment and 
move to the starting point.
xThe Tester/Investigator should st and near the starting line duri ng the test but should not walk 
with the patient.  Patients will be instructed to walk al one, not run, from one end of the 

[ADDRESS_396668] if the patient can no longer continue, but they should resume walking 
as soon as they feel able to do so (see below for instructive language th at should be used in 
this instance). The clock must con tinue to run during the brief rests.
xThe Tester can stop the test at any time for safety-related reasons  (e.g., chest pain, intolerable 
dyspnea, leg cramps, pale or ashen-looking appearance).
Patient Instructions Before the Test - The person administering the test will use the following 
dialog with the patient immediately before the test (repeat the entire set of instructions if the 
patient does not seem to understand):
R“The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for [ADDRESS_396669] without he sitation. Now I’m going to show you. Please 
watch the way I turn without hesitation.” ( The tester then demonstrates by [CONTACT_321356][INVESTIGATOR_180470] a cone briskly ). 
R“Are you ready to do that? I am  going to use this counter to  keep track of the number 
of laps you complete. I will c lick it each time you turn ar ound at this starting line. 
Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE fo r 6 minutes, but don’t 
run or jog.” ( The tester should position the patient  at the starting line and ask the 
patient if he/she has any questions about th e test and should confirm that the patient 
understands what he/she is expected to do.  Re peat the entire set of  instructions if the 
patient does not seem to understand).
R“Start now, or whenever you are ready.”
xPatient Instructions During the Test – As soon as the patient starts  to walk, start the timer. 
The person administering the test  should not walk with the patie nt.  The Tester should not 
talk to anyone during the tes ting. Only standardized phrases for encouragement can be used 
during the test.  To best ensure reproducibility  and consistency of the testing, standardized 
phrases should be used every minut e according to the following pattern:
RAfter the 1stminute, tell the patient the follow ing (in even tones): “You are doing 
well. You have 5 minutes to go.”
RWhen the timer shows 4 minut es remaining, tell the pati ent the following: “Keep up 
the good work. You have 4 minutes to go.”
RWhen the timer shows 3 minutes  remaining, tell the patien t the following: “You are 
doing well. You are halfway done.”
RWhen the timer shows 2 minut es remaining, tell the pati ent the following: “Keep up 
the good work. You have only 2 minutes left.”

Confidential RWhen the timer shows only 1 minute rema ining, tell the patient: “You are doing well. 
You have only 1 minute to go.” 
RDo not use other words of encouragement or  body language to get the patient to speed 
up.
RIf the patient is slowing down, stops or expr esses that he/she wants to stop, the tester 
should say: “You can lean agai nst the wall if you would lik e; then continue walking 
whenever you feel able.” Do not stop the timer.
RIf the patient stops before the 6 minutes are up and refuses to con tinue (or the Tester 
decides that they should not continue), wheel  the chair over  for the patient to sit on, 
discontinue the walk, and note on the worksh eet the distance, the time stopped, and 
the reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_224687]. 
RWhen the timer is 15 sec onds from completion, say this: “In a moment I’m going to 
tell you to stop.  When I do, just stop right  where you are, and I will come to you.”  
When the timer rings (or buzzes ), say this: “Stop!”  Walk over to the patient.  Mark 
the spot where they stopped. 
RIf the patient walked for less than 6 minutes (i.e., stops prior to 6 minutes and does 
not start again), record the time walked as well as the distance.
xPost-Test Procedures:
RThe Tester will record the number of laps from the counter and the additional distance 
covered (the number of meters  in the final lap).  Calculate the total distance walked, 
rounding to the nearest meter, a nd record it on the worksheet.
RFollowing the 6MWT, the Tester will always  obtain and record the post-walk Borg 
Dyspnea Score.

ConfidentialAPPENDIX 7. BORG SCALE AND INSTRUCTIONS
Instructions:  Use this rating scale to report how strong your perception is. It can be exertion, 
pain or something else. First l ook at the verbal expressions. Start with them and then the 
numbers. Of these ten (10) or ”Ext remely strong”, “Maximal” is a v ery important in tensity  level. 
This is the most intense percep tion or feeling yo u have ever had.
If your experience or feeling is “Very weak”, you should  say “1”, if it is “Moderate”, say “3”. 
Note that “Moderate” is “3” and thus weaker th an “Medium”, “Mean” or “Mid dle”. If the 
experience is “Strong” or “Heavy” (it feels “Difficu lt”) say “5”. Note that “Strong” is abou t half 
of “Maximal”. If your feeling is “Very strong”, choose a numbe r from 6 to 8. If your perception 
or feeling is stronger than  ”10”, - “Extremely strong”, “Maximal” – you can use a larger numb er, 
e.g. 12 or still higher (that’s why “Absolute maximum” is marked with a dot.
It's very important that you re port what you actually experience or feel, not what you think you 
should rep ort. Be as spontaneous and honest as possible and try to avoid u nder- or 
overestimatin g. Look at the verbal de scriptors and  then choose a number.
When rating exertion give a numb er that correspo nds to how hard and strenuou s you perceive the 
work to be. The perception of exer tion is mainly felt as strain a nd fatigue in your muscles and as 
breathlessness or any aches.
0 ”Nothing at all”, means that you don’t feel any exertio n wh atsoever, no muscle fatig ue, no  
breathlessness or di fficulties breathing.
1 “Very weak” means a very light exertion. As taking  a shorter walk at yo ur own  pace.
3 “Moderate” is somewhat but no t especially hard. It feels go od and not difficult to go on.
5 “Strong”. The work is hard and tiring , but con tinuing isn't terribly diff icult. Th e effo rt and  
exertion is about half as intense as “Maximal”.
7 “Very strong” is quite strenu ous. You  can still go on, but you really have to pu sh yourself and 
you are very tired.
10 “Extremely strong – Maximal” is an extremely strenuou s level. For most people th is is the 
most strenuous exertion they have ever experienced previous ly in their lives.

ConfidentialAPPENDIX 14. ADVERSE EVENTS:  DEFINITIONS AN D PROCEDURES 
FOR RECORDING, EVALUA TION, FOLLOW UP, AND 
REPORTING
Definition of Adverse Event
Adverse Event Definition
xAn adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurr ence in a patient, temporally associated with 
the use of investigational product (IP), whet her or not considered related to the IP.
xNOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of IP.
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition 
xAny abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clin ical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety 
assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram, radiological s cans, vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from Baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment
of the investigator (i.e., not relate d to progression of underlying disease).
xExacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-ex isting condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or inte nsity of the condition.
xNew conditions detected or diagnosed after IP ad ministration even though it may have been present 
before the start of the study.
xSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequel ae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.
xSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either IP or a concomitant 
medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/serious adverse event (SAE) unless it is 
an intentional overdose taken with possible suicid al/self-harming intent.  Such overdoses should be 
reported regardless of sequelae.
x“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmaco logical action” per se will not be reported as an 
AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, 
symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from l ack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if 
they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition 
xAny clinically significant abnormal laboratory fi ndings or other abnormal safety assessments 
which are associated with the underlying disease,  unless judged by [CONTACT_321357]’s condition.
xThe disease/disorder being studied or expect ed progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more se vere than expected for the patient’s condition.
xMedical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the 
procedure is the AE.
xSituations in which an untoward medical occurr ence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
xAnticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at 
the start of the study that do not worsen.

ConfidentialDefinition of Serious Adverse Event
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then  it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptom s of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).
A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
1. Results in death
2. Is life-threatening
The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious ' refers to an event in wh ich the patient was at risk 
of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to  an event, which hypothetically might have caused 
death, if it were more severe.
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321287], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321288] h as been detained (usually  involving at least an 
overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321289]/or  treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321290] y other serious criteria, 
the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-exis ting condition that did not worsen from Baseline is 
not considered an AE.
4. Results in persistent disability/incapacity
xThe term disability means a substantial disrup tion of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.
xThis definition is not intended to include experi ences of relatively minor medical significance such 
as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
6. Other situations:
xMedical or scientific judgment should be ex ercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important  medical events that may not be immediately life
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321291].
These events should usually  be considered serious.
xExamples of such events include invasive or  malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronc hospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or devel opment of drug dependency or drug abuse.

ConfidentialRecording and Follow Up of Adverse Ev ents and/or Serious Adverse Events
Adverse Event and Seriou s Adverse Event Recording
xWhen an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation 
(e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports , and diagnostics reports) related to the event.
xThe Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the case report form.
xIt is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_113502]’s medical records to 
Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE case report form page.
xThere may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_321292].
In this case, all patient identifiers, with the excep tion of the patient number, will be redacted on the 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_321293].
xThe Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnos is of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or 
other clinical information. Whenever possible, th e diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) 
will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
The Investigator will make an assessment of in tensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study 
and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
xMild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_102], causing minimal discomfort, and not 
interfering with everyday activities.
xModerate: An event that causes sufficient di scomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.
xSevere: An event that prevents normal everyday ac tivities. An AE that is assessed as severe 
should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an 
event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
xAn event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in 
the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Causality
xThe Investigator is obligated to assess the re lationship between IP and each occurrence of each 
AE/SAE.
xA “reasonable possibility” of a relationship convey s that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, ra ther than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
xThe Investigator will use clinical j udgment to determine the relationship.
xAlternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as 
well as the temporal relationship of the event to IP administration will be considered and 
investigated.
xThe Investigator will also consult the Investig ator’s Brochure and/or Product Information, for 
marketed products, in his/her assessment.
xFor each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
xThere may be situations in which an SAE h as occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.

ConfidentialAssessment of Causality
xThe Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and 
send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
xThe causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
Follow Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
xThe Investigator is obligated to perform or ar range for the conduct of s upplemental measurements 
and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as  requested by [CONTACT_321358]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as po ssible. This may include additional laboratory tests 
or investigations, histopathological examinati ons, or consultation with other health care 
professionals.
xIf a patient dies during participation in the st udy or during a recognized follow-up period, the 
Investigator will provide the Sponsor with a copy of any post-mort em findings including 
histopathology.
xNew or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed case report form.
xThe Investigator will submit any up dated SAE data to the Sponsor wi thin 24 hours of receipt of the 
information. 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Serious Adverse Event Reporting to the Spons or via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
xThe primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the Sponsor will be the electronic data collection 
tool.
xIf the electronic system is unavaila ble, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see 
next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours).
xThe site will enter the SAE data into the elect ronic system as soon as it becomes available.
xAfter the study is completed at a given site, the el ectronic data collection tool will be taken off-line 
to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
xIf a site receives a report of a new SAE from  a study patient or receives updated data on a 
previously reported SAE after the electronic data co llection tool has been taken off-line, then the 
site can report this information on a paper SAE fo rm (see next section) or to the Sponsor’s medical 
monitor/SAE coordinator by [CONTACT_756].
xContacts for SAE reporting can be foun d on the Contact [CONTACT_23774].
Serious Adverse Event Reporting to th e Sponsor via Paper Case Report Form
xEmail transmission of the SAE paper case report  form is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the Sponsor’s Medical  Monitor or the SAE Coordinator.
xIn rare circumstances and in the absence of f acsimile equipment, notifi cation by [CONTACT_20021] a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by [CONTACT_22855].
xInitial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete and sign 
the SAE case report form pages within the designated reporting time frames.
xContacts for SAE reporting can be found on the Contact [CONTACT_23774].

 Page [ADDRESS_1281217] common glomerular disease in the world.  Retrospective studies of 
affected patients reveal that the prognosis is highly variable with actuarial renal survival at 10 
years varying from 57% to 85% (D’Amico 2000).  The natural history of th e disease is not 
benign with 60% of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_912162] -stage renal disease by 20 years 
(Samuels et al., 2004).   
 There is no good animal model for IgA nephropathy.  In the [ADDRESS_1281218] 
characterized (Berger et al., 1 968), understanding the pathogenesis and causation has been a 
challenging process.  Studies to date suggest that the pathogenesis is the deposition of abnormal 
polymeric IgA1 (pI[INVESTIGATOR_912161]1) immunoglobulins in the mesangium of kidney glomeruli causing an inflammatory immune response.  Pathogenic pI[INVESTIGATOR_912161]1s in patients with IgA nephropathy have abnormal O-galactosylation at the hinge region.  The aberrant pI[INVESTIGATOR_912161]1s have a propensity to form immune complexes and accumulate in the kidney mesangium.  There is evidence of incr eased 
plasma cells secreting altered pI[INVESTIGATOR_912161]1 in the bone marrow and tonsils of subjects with IgA nephropathy (Barratt et al., 2005).  Serum IgA level is elevated in up to 50% of patients at some point in the course of the disease.   
 
Transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) mediates the inflammatory immune response 
(cytokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules) to abnormal pI[INVESTIGATOR_912161]1 deposition in the kidney 
mesangium.  Expression of NF-κB in kidney glomeruli and the interstitium correlated with 
progressive kidney tissue injury (Ashizawa et al., 2003). 
 In vitro production of IL-6 by [CONTACT_912167] (Wada et al., 2003).  Urinary IL-6 levels in subjects 
with progressive disease were significantly higher than stable subjects suggesting that elevated urinary IL-6 levels could be used to prognosticate disease (Harada et al., 2002).  
 
A switch to immunoproteasomes (iPS) was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) of patients with IgA nephropathy and significant proteinuria.  Specifically, the switch 
to iPS of the chymotrypsin-like catalytic subunits (LMP7/β5) was significantly higher in IgA 
subjects not in clinical remission (Coppo et al., 2009).   
 
The risk for progression to end-stage renal disease is highest in patients with the following risk  
factors: elevated serum creatinine at presentation, significant proteinuria (greater than 1gm/day), hypertension, and persistent microhematuria (Goto et al., 2009; Mackinnon et al., 2008; Reich et 
al., 2007).  An international consensus report also proposed pathological features (mesangial hypercellularity, tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis, segmental glomerulosclerosis) that could prognosticate renal survival (Cattran et al., 2009).

 Page 10 Optimal therapy for the high-risk group to slow the deterioration of kidney function is ill defined.  
The pathogenesis of the disease has to be further investigated but initial events eliciting abnormal pI[INVESTIGATOR_912161]1 deposition in the kidney lead to an inflammatory response, which provides a rationale for immunomodulatory therapy (Floege et al., 2008).  Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil have been investigated as possible treatment for aggressive IgA kidney disease.  A clinical trial is ongoing for a B cell modulating drug (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) as a possible therapeutic agent for high-risk individuals.  There is no consensus on the use of immunomodulato ry agents for 
severe IgA nephropathy.  Corticosteroid therapy had the most promise in a meta -analysis of 
randomized controlled trials (Samuels et al., 2004).  However, prolonged corticosteroid therapy has serious side effects including osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, significant weight gain, hypertension, and major infections.  In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we aim to investigate the effect of VELCADE in subjects with severe IgA nephropathy.  VELCADE is a proteasome inhibitor and potentially has activity against non -
cancerous plasma cells (Perry et al., 2008).  VELCADE may abrogate the production of abnormal pI[INVESTIGATOR_912161]1 in IgA nephropathy.  VELCADE may mitigate the expression of NF -κB in the 
kidney and reduce the inflammatory response to abnormal pI[INVESTIGATOR_912161]1 deposition.  Finally, VELCADE may interfere with the upregulation of iPS and promote clinical remission in severe IgA nephropathy.   
1.2 VELCADE for Injection 
1.2.1 Scientific Background 
VELCADE for injection is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by [CONTACT_149615], Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies.  VELCADE is currently approved by [CONTACT_6581] (US FDA) and it is registered in Europe for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at l east 
one prior therapy.   By [CONTACT_61670] a single molecular target, the proteasome, VELCADE affects multiple signaling pathways.  The anti-neoplastic effect of VELCADE likely involves several distinct mechanisms, including inhibition of cell growth and survival pathways, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of expression of genes that control cellular adhesion, migration and angiogenesis.  Thus, the mechanisms by [CONTACT_912168], and the extent to which each affected pathway is critical to the inhibition of tumor growth could also differ.  VELCADE has a novel pattern of cytotoxicity in National Cancer Institute (NCI) in vitro 
and in vivo assays (Adams et al., 1999).  In addition, VELCADE has cytotoxic activity in a 
variety of xenograft tumor models, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and radiation (Steiner et al., 2001; Teicher et al., 1999; Cusack et al., 2001; LeBlanc et al., 2002; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_149587]., 2002).  Notably, VELCADE induces apoptosis in cells that over express bcl-2, a

 Page 11 genetic trait that confers unregu lated growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics 
(McConkey et al., 1999). 
 VELCADE is thought to be efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear f actor 
κB (NF-κB) activation, its attenuation of interleukin -6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a direct 
apoptotic effect, and possibly anti-angiogenic and other effects (Hideshima et al., 2001).  
1.2.2 Nonclinical Pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in the rat and cynomolgus monkey.  Upon intravenous (IV) bolus administration, VELCADE displays a rapid distribution phase (t½α <10 minutes) followed by a longer elimination phase (t½ β 5–15 hours).  VELCADE 
has a large volume of distribution (range 5–50 L/kg).  The plasma PK profile is well described by a 2-compartment model.  The pharmacodynamic action of VELCADE is well established and can be measured through an ex vivo assay (20S proteasome activity) (Lightcap et al., 2000).  This  assay was used to 
determine the duration of drug effect in lieu of the PK data in the early preclinical toxicology studies as well as to set a guide for dose escalation in humans.  Following dosing with VELCADE in the rat and cynomolgus monkey, proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood had a half-life less than 24 hours, with proteasome activity returning to pretreatment baseline within 24 
hours in monkey and within 48 to 72 hours in rat after a single dose of VELCADE.  Further, intermittent but high inhibition (>70%) of proteasome activity was better tolerated than sustained inhibition.  Thus, a twice-weekly clinical dosing regimen was chosen in order to allow return of proteasome activity towards baseline between dose administrations.  
1.2.3 Nonclinical Toxicity 
Single-dose IV toxicity studies were conducted with VELCADE in the mouse, rat, dog, and monkey to establish the single-dose maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The MTDs were 0.25 mg/kg (1.5 mg/m
2) and 0.067 mg/kg (0.8 mg/m2) in the [ADDRESS_1281219] sensitive species, rat and 
monkey, respectively.  Repeat-dose multi-cycle toxicity studies of 3 and 6 months in the rat and 9 months in the monkey, each with 8-week recovery periods, were conducted to characterize the chronic toxicity of VELCADE when administered by [CONTACT_91820].  The MTD in the 6-month rat study was 0.10 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m
2) and the key target organs were the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, hematopoietic and lymphoid systems.  The MTD in the 9 -month 
monkey study was 0.05 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the key target organs were the GI tract, 
hematopoietic and lymphoid systems, peripheral nervous system, and kidney.  Full or partial reversibility was observed for each of the toxicities described to date.   
 In general, the nature of the toxicity of VELCADE is similar across species, and target organs of toxicity in animals have been largely predictive of human toxicity.  The toxicity of VELCADE in animals is characterized by a steep dose-response with mortality seen at dosages above the MTD.

(CV) effects of hypotension and vascular changes with secondary bradycardia and the cause of death in long-term studies has been attributed to GI or hemato logic toxicity.  The pharmacologic 
effects of VELCADE on the CV system have been extensively characterized and have demonstrated that indirect effects on CV function occur only at acutely lethal dosages and are abrogated by [CONTACT_91821].  Additional detailed information regarding the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of VELCADE may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.2.4 Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
The clinical pharmacology characterization of VELCADE has been determined  from phase 1 
studies in subjects with solid tumors and hematological malignancies, and confirmed in phase  2 
studies in subjects with multiple myeloma.  
 
VELCADE demonstrates multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics. Following intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m
2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose, the mean first-dose maximum observed plasma 
concentrations of VELCADE were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively in 11 subjects with multiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values >50 mL/min participating in a pharmacokinetics study.  In subsequent doses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1.0 mg/m
2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose.  The mean 
elimination half -life of VELCADE upon multiple dosing ranged from [ADDRESS_1281221] dose.  Mean Total Body Clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m
2 and 1.3 mg/m2, 
respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1.0 and 
1.3 mg/m2, respectively.  Clinical experience has shown that the change in clearance does not 
result in overt toxicity from accumulation in this multidose regimen in humans.  
 In subjects with advanced malignancies, the maximum pharmacodynamic effec t (inhibition of 
20S activity) occurred within 1-hour post dose.  At the therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/m
[ADDRESS_1281222] dose was approximately 
61%.  The time course of proteasome inhibition in  subjects is characterized by [CONTACT_151195], followed by [CONTACT_91824] 6 to 24 hours to within 50% of the pretreatment activity.  On the Day 1, 4, 8, and 11 schedule, variable (10%–30%) levels of proteasome inhibition have been observed at next scheduled dosing.  In theory, this advantage allows cells to recover proteasome activity for normal cellular housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_91780].

changes in plasma VELCADE concentration over the range of 0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL relating to large increases in the percent inhibition (0 –60%).  After that, a plateau occurs where marginal 
increases of proteasome inhibition are observed in spi[INVESTIGATOR_91781].

subjects treated through Millennium-sponsored clinical trials, Investigator-Initiated Studies, the US NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and with commercially available drug.  VELCADE has been commercially available since 13 May 2003.  
 
The overall goal of the Millennium phase 1 program was to determine the MTD and dose -
limiting toxicity (DLT) of VELCADE in a number of therapeutic settings involving subjects with various advanced malignancies.  In a Phase I trial in subjects with refractory hematologic malignancies, the MTD for a twice weekly for 4 weeks of a 42 day cycle was 1.04 mg/m
2/dose, 
with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise (Orlowski et al., 2002).  The toxicity was greatest during the third and fourth weeks of therapy. In the 3-week schedule of VELCADE monotherapy (4 doses, given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m
2/dose (3 subjects with 
Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 with peripheral sensory neuropathy).  Therefore, the MTD at this schedule was 1.3 mg/m
2/dose.  In a 35-day treatment cycle with 4 weekly doses of VELCADE 
monotherapy, the MTD was 1.6 mg/m2/dose and DLT included hypotension, tachycardia, 
diarrhea, and syncope.    In phase 1 clinical studies, anti-tumor activity was reported in subjects with NHL, multiple myeloma, Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx, bronchoalveolar carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer.  
 The safety and efficacy of VELCADE in subjects with multiple myeloma were investigated in two phase 2 clinical studies, studies M34100-024 (subjects with first relapse) (Jagannath et al, 2004) and M34100-025 (subjects with second or greater relapse and refractory to their last prior therapy) (Richardson et al, 2003).  In M34100-025, [ADDRESS_1281225] 2 previous treatments received VELCADE , 1.3 mg/m
2 
on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle. The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) response criteria, as described by [CONTACT_149617] (Blade et al., 1998) were utilized to determine disease response.  CRs were observed in 4% of subjects, with an additional 6% of subjects meeting all criteria for CR but having a positive immunofixation test.  PR or better was observed in 27% of subjects, and the overall response rate (CR, PR and minor response [MR] combined) was 35%.  Seventy percent of subjects experienced stable disease or better.   
 
The phase 3 study (M34101-039) (Richardson et al, 2005), also referred to as the APEX study,

response rate, and survival) to subjects with relapsed or refractory MM relative to treatment with high-dose dexamethasone.  The study was also designed to determine the safety and tolerability of VELCADE relative to high-dose dexamethasone, and whether treatment with VELC ADE was 
associated with superior clinical benefit and quality of life relative to high -dose dexamethasone. 
A total of 669 subjects were enrolled and 663 subjects received study drug (VELCADE: 331; dexamethasone: 332).  Subjects randomized to VELCADE received 1.3 mg/m
2 I.V. push twice 
weekly on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week cycle for up to eight treatment cycles as induction therapy, followed by 1.3 mg/m
2 VELCADE weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 5-week cycle 
for three cycles as maintenance therapy. Su bjects randomized to dexamethasone received oral 
dexamethasone 40 mg once daily on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of a 5 -week cycle for up to 
four treatment cycles as induction therapy, followed by [CONTACT_149618] 40 mg once daily on days 1 to 4 followed of a 4-week cycle for five cycles as maintenance therapy. The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) response criteria, as described by [CONTACT_149617] (Blade et al., 1998) were utilized to determine disease response.  There was a 78% increase in TTP for the VELCADE arm. Median TTP was 6.2 months for the VELCADE arm and 3.5 months for the dexamethasone arm (P<.0001). CR (complete response) + PR (partial response) was 38% with VELCADE vs. 18% with dexamethasone (P<.0001). CR was 6% with VELCADE 
vs. <1% with dexamethasone (P<.0001). The CR + nCR rate was13% with VELCADE vs. 2% 
with dexamethasone. In subjects who had received only one prior line of treatment (VELCADE: 
132; dexamethasone: 119), CR + PR was 45% with VELCADE vs. 26% with dexamethasone 
(P=.0035). With a median 8.3 months of follow -up, overall survival was significantly longer 
(P=.0013) for subjects on the VELCADE arm vs. subjects on the dexamethasone arm. The probability of survival at one year was 80% for the VELCADE arm vs. 66% for the 
dexamethasone arm, which represented a 41% decreased relative risk of death in the first year with VELCADE (P=.0005). In subjects who had received only one prior line of treatment, the probability of survival at one year was 89% for the VELCADE arm vs. 72% for the 
dexamethasone arm, which represented a 61% decreased relative risk of death in the first year with VELCADE (P=.0098). Updated response rates and survival data were reported for M34101-039 (Richardson ASH, 2005). The updated CR (complete response) + PR (partial response) rate was 43% with VELCADE. The CR + nCR rate was 16% with VELCADE. With a median 22 months of follow-up, overall survival was significantly longer for subjects on the VELCADE arm vs. subjects on the dexamethasone arm. The median overall survival was 29.8 
months (95% CI: 23.2, not estimable) for the VELCADE arm vs 23.7 months (95% CI: 18.7, 29.1) for the dexamethasone arm (hazard ratio = 0.77, P= 0.0272). The probability of survival at one year was 80% for the VELCADE arm vs. vs 67% for the dexamethasone arm (P=0.0002).

Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pr egnant while being treated with 
VELCADE.  Genotoxicity testing has shown that VELCADE is negative in the in vitro  Ames 
assay and in the in vivo  micronucleus assay, but it is a clastogen in the in vitro chromosomal 
aberration assay.   
Additional details on the potential risks of VELCADE may be found in the Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
1.3 Study rationale and selection of drug doses 
In vitro  data show that VELCADE has antitumor activity via the following mechanisms: directly 
induces apoptosis of multiple myeloma cells, inhibits activation of NF-κB in multiple myeloma 
cells and in tumor microenvironment, blocks production and intracellular signaling of IL -6. 
Clinical trials of VELCADE in renal transplant subjects without cancer suggest that it has 
activity against non-malignant plasma cells.  Proteasome inhibition by [CONTACT_912170]-malignant human plasma cells and facilitated the treatment of antibody -
mediated humoral rejection of kidney allografts (Perry et al., 2008).  In combination with immunosuppressive medications for treating antibody-mediated and cell-mediated acute rejection, VELCADE therapy reduced the levels of donor -specific antibodies with minimal 
toxicity in renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (Everly et al., 2008).  Abrogation of anti -HLA 
alloantibodies were successfully achieved with VELCADE therapy in sensitized renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (Trivedi et al., 2009). 
In IgA nephropathy, abnormal pI[INVESTIGATOR_912161]1 immunoglobulins are produced by [CONTACT_912171] (Barratt et al., 2005).  These aberrant pI[INVESTIGATOR_912161]1 antibodies have a 
tendency to form immune complexes in the mesangium and induce an inflammatory response via the NF-κB pathway (Ashizawa et al., 2003).  An intra-renal autoimmune response characterized 
by [CONTACT_912172] (such as IL-6), growth factors, and adhesion molecules are thought to 
be the cause of progressive renal damage in IgA nephropathy (Lai et al., 2009).  The ubiquitin -
proteasome pathway facilitates the translocation of transcription factor NF -κB from the cytosol 
(where it constitutively resides complexed to its inhibitory protein I κB) into the nucleus.  The 
human kidney proteasome (fully inducible to become iPS) has been purified and characterized confirming the observation that the kidney is primed a nd predisposed to inflammatory response 
in autoimmune glomerular diseases (Baldovino et al., 2006).  Subjects with significant

VELCADE® IIS Protocol X05320   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page [ADDRESS_1281230] iPS detected in PBMCs 
(Coppo et al., 2009). Taken together, there is mounting evidence to support the use of proteasome inhibitor therapy for aggressive IgA nephropathy.  
 
Investigators in kidney transplant pi[INVESTIGATOR_912164] 4 doses of VELCADE (1 cycle) for 
treating renal transplant rejection (Perry et al., 2008 ; Everly et al., 2008; Trivedi et al., 2009).  
We propose similar doses (1 cycle on days 1, 4, 8, 11) for induction therapy in subjects with IgA nephropathy.  An additional cycle will be given to non -responders following VELCADE 
induction therapy.

 Page 21 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is to investigate ability of VELCADE to induce complete or 
partial remission in subjects with severe IgA nephropathy and risk factors for progression of 
disease.  Complete remission is defined as proteinuria of less than or equal to 300 mg per day.  
Partial remission is defined as reduction in daily proteinuria of greater than 50% from baseline (enrollment) proteinuria.  A clinical relapse is defined as a rise in daily proteinuria of greater 
than 50% from nadir following successful induction therapy.  A safety analysis of the use of 
VELCADE in this study population will be performed. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of this study are to assess clinical outcomes relating to safety and  
efficacy, such as infection, malignancy, preservation of renal function, and reduction in the 
requirement of anti-hypertensive drugs; and to study mechanistic assays to predict remission.  The proportion of subjects with less than 50% reduction in daily p roteinuria or partial responders 
will be assessed.

3.3 Study Treatments 
3.3.1 Clinical Trial Materials  
VELCADE for injection is a sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution and is supplied in vials 
containing VELCADE and mannitol at a 1:10 ratio.  For example, vials containing 3.5  mg of 
VELCADE contain 35 mg of mannitol.   
3.3.2 Preparation, Handling, and Storage of Drugs 
VELCADE
 
Vials containing lyophilized VELCADE for Injection should be stored according to the label 
requirements.  For the [LOCATION_002], store at USP Controlled Room Temperature which is 25ºC (77ºF); excursions permitted from 15 to 30ºC (59 to 86ºF ).  To date, stability data indicate that 
the lyophilized drug product is stable for at least [ADDRESS_1281242] a physician after any

Drug is available in sterile, single use vials containing 3.5 mg of VELCADE.  Each vial of 
VELCADE for Injection should be reconstituted under a laminar flow biological cabinet (hood) 
within eight hours before dosing with 3.5 mL of normal (0.9%) saline, Sodium Chloride Injection USP, so that the reconstituted solution contains VELCADE at a concentration of 
1 mg/mL.  Prior to reconstitution the vials should remain in the cartons to protect them from light.  Dissolution is completed in approximately [ADDRESS_1281244] be kept of all 
disposed materials. 
VELCADE Administration and Dosage Schedule
 
VELCADE is to be administered (1 cycle) at a dose level of 1.3mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, [ADDRESS_1281245] not responded within 30 days 
after the induction cycle.  VELCADE may be administered within a window of ± [ADDRESS_1281246] 72 hours after the previous VELCADE dose.  Drug will be administered only to eligible subjects under the supervision of the investigator or identified sub -investigator(s).  
Subjects may be treated on an outpatient basis, if possible.  The pharmacist will prepare the drug under aseptic conditions.  The amount (in mg)  of drug to be administered will be determined 
based on body surface area.  Body surface area is to be calculated based on body weight using a standard nomogram (see section 8.2).  The dose should be calculated on Day 1 of each cycle; the dose administered should remain the same throughout each cycle but should be recalculated at the start of the next cycle.  If a subject experiences a notable change in weight (e.g., loss or gain of ≥8 lbs or 3.6 kg) within a cycle, as determined by [CONTACT_149624], then the subject’s dose should be recalculated at that time.  
The appropriate amount of VELCADE will be drawn from the injection vial and administered as an intravenous (IV) push over [ADDRESS_1281247] occurred after the previous dose(s).  Toxicities are to be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  3.0 (see section 8.5).   
 All previously established or new toxicities observed at any time, with the exception of neuropathic pain and peripheral sensory neuropathy, are to be managed as follows:

• If the subject experiences febrile neutropenia, a Grade 4 hema tologic toxicity (including a 
platelet count <25 × 109/L) or any ≥Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity considered by [CONTACT_912173], then drug is to be held. 
 • For non-hematologic toxicities, VELCADE is to be held for up to 2 weeks until the toxicity returns to Grade 1 or better. 
 • For hematologic toxicities, VELCADE is to be held for up to [ADDRESS_1281248] has a hemoglobin value of 8.0 g/dL, platelet value of 30 × 10

1.0 × 109/L.  
 • Dose interruption or study discontinuation is not required for lymphopenia of any grade.   
 • If, after VELCADE has been held, the toxicity does not resolve, as defined above, then drug must be discontinued. 
 If the toxicity resolves, as defined above, and VELCADE is to be restarted, the dose must be 
reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 25% as follows:  • If the subject was receiving 1.3 mg/m
2, reduce the dose to 1.0 mg/m2. 
• If the subject was receiving 1.0 mg/m2, reduce the dose to 0.7 mg/m2. 
• If the subject was receiving 0.7 mg/m2, discontinue drug, unless subject is responding, in 
which case this should be discussed with the PI.  Dose reductions below 0.7 mg/m2 should be 
avoided, but will be considered if subject is having a good response.  
 Subjects who experience VELCADE-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral sensory neuropathy are to be managed as presented in Table 3.1 Management of Patients with VELCADE-Related Neuropathic Pain and/or Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy.

The neurotoxicity-directed questionnaire (see section 8.6) is a useful tool for determining the 
presence and intensity of  neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy from the subject’s 
perspective.  Neuropathic symptoms are more prominent than abnormalities on the clinical examination.  After the subject completes the neurotoxicity -directed questionnaire, the 
questionnaire should be reviewed to assist with the evaluation of the onset and intensity of peripheral neuropathy and other neurotoxicities that may possibly require intervention or dose modification.  
Dosage in Subjects with Hepatic Impairment  
 
Subjects with mild he patic impairment do not require a starting dose adjustment and should be 
treated per the recommended VELCADE dose. Subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
should be started on VELCADE at a reduced dose of 0.7 mg/m2 
per injection during the firs t cycle, 
and a subsequent dose escalation to 1.0 mg/m2 
or further dose reduction to 0.5 mg/m2 
may be 
considered based on subject tolerance (see Table 3).

 Page 31 4 ADVERSE EVENTS 
4.1 Definitions 
4.1.1 Adverse Event Definition 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a c ausal relationship with the treatment.  
An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the drug, whether or not it is considered to be drug related.  This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of drug.  
4.1.2 Serious Adverse Event Definition 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening.  Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a persons’ ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event.  An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124495], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent on e of the outcomes 
listed in the definitions for SAEs.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
 Clarification should be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” since they ARE NOT synonymous.  The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache).  This is NOT the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria desc ribed above and are 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning.  A severe

VELCADE® IIS Protocol X05320   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 32 adverse event does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, persistent nausea 
of several hours duration may be considered severe nausea but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke resulting in only a minor degree of disability may be considered mild, but would be defined as an SAE based on the above noted criteria.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
4.[ADDRESS_1281252] report all serious adverse event (SAE) regardless of relationship with 
any study drug or expectedness to Millennium as soon as possible, but no later than 5 calendar days of the investigator-sponsor’s observation or awareness of the event.  All sub-investigators must report all SAEs to the investigator-sponsor so that the investigator-sponsor can meet his/her foregoing reporting obligations to Millennium.  
Investigator-sponsor must also provide Millennium with a copy of all communications related to the Study or Drug with the applicable regulatory authority, including, but not limited to, telephone conversation logs, as soon as possible but no later than 5 calend ar days of that 
communication.  
Millennium’s Product Safety Department will send to the investigator -sponsor a monthly listing 
of the SAE reports received for SAE verification.  Investigator -sponsor will be responsible for 
forwarding such reports to any sub-investigator(s) and providing any follow-up safety 
information requested by [CONTACT_20555].

For both serious and non-serious adverse events, the investigator or sub-investigator must determine both the intensity of the event and the relationship of the event to drug administration.  
 Relationship to drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_912174]-investigator 
responding yes or no to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the adverse event is associated with the drug? 
Intensity for each adverse event, including any lab abnormality, will be determined by [CONTACT_548987], version 3.0, as a guideline, wherever possible.  The criteria are available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html

Body surface area (BSA) should be calculated using a standard nomogram that yields the 
following results in meters squared (m2): 
BSA = 3131)( ) ( lbsWt inchesHt × 
or 
BSA = 3600)( )( kgWt cmHt × 
Creatinine clearance (CrCl) can be calculated using the Cockroft -Gault equation as follows: 
 CrCl (ml/min) =  (140-age) (actual wt in kg)               
      72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl) 
For females use 85% of calculated CrCl value.  
Note: In markedly obese subjects, the Cockroft-Gault formula will tend to overestimate the 
creatinine clearance. (Adipose tissue tends to contribute little creatinine requiring renal clearance.)

The following table presents the NYHA classification of cardiac disease:  
Class  Functiona l Capacity  Objective Assessment  
I Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of 
physical activity.  Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue 
fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain.  No objective evidence 
of cardiovascula r 
disease.  
II Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical 
activity.  They are comfortable at rest.  Ordinary physical activity 
results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain.  Objective evidence of 
minimal 
cardiovasc ular disease.  
III Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of 
physical activity.  They are comfortable at rest.  Less than ordinary 
activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain.  Objective evidence of 
moderately severe  
cardiovascular disease.  
IV Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any 
physical activity without discomfort.  Symptoms of heart failure or 
the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest.  If any physical 
activity is undertaken,  discomfort is increased.  Objective evidence of 
severe cardiovascular 
disease.

page 46 8.4   Declaration of Helsinki 
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: 
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly Helsinki, Finland, June [ADDRESS_1281267] th e health of the people.  The 
physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the words, "The health of my patient will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the patient's interest when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the patient."  
4. Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation involving human subjects. 
5. In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well being of the human subject should take precedence over the interests of sc ience and society. 
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of disease.  Even the best-proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures  involve risks and burdens. 
8. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings and protect their health and rights.  Some research populations are vulnerable and need special protection.  The particular needs of the economically and medically disadvantaged 
must be recognized.  Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse

page [ADDRESS_1281268] or to others.  This does not preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in medical research.  The design of all studies should be publicly available.

page [ADDRESS_1281269], the confidentiality of the patient's information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.  
13. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort 
it may entail.  The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in 
the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the 
subject's freely given informed consent, preferably in writing.  If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
14. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physic ian should be 
particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress.  In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well -
informed physician who is not engaged in the investigation and  who is completely 
independent of this relationship. 
15. For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law.  These groups should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons. 
16. When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative.  
17. Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or

FINAL

VELCADE® IIS Protocol X05320  CONFIDENTIAL 
page 49 advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents 
obtaining informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research populat ion.  The 
specific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the review committee.  The protocol should state t hat consent to remain in the 
research should be obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized surrogate. 
18. Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations.  In publication of the results of research, the investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results.  Negative as well as positive results should be published or otherwise publicly available.  Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication.  Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH MEDICAL CARE 
1. The physician may combine medical research w ith medical care, only to the extent that the 
research is justified by [CONTACT_54233], diagnostic or therapeutic value.  When medical research is combined with medical care, additional standards apply to protect the 
patients who are research subjects. 
2. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against 
those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods.  This does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no pro ven prophylactic, 
diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.  
3. At the conclusion of the study, every patient entered into the study should be assured of access to the best-proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by [CONTACT_1758]. 
4. The physician should fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the research.  The refusal of a patient to participate in a study must never interfere with the patient-physician relationship. 
5. In the treatment of a patient, where proven prop hylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods 
do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from the patient, must be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering.  Where possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy.  In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published.  The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

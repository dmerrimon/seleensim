nerve root (C5 -C8, T1). Local anesthetic can be deposited anywhere along the course of 
the brachial plexus, from the neck to the axilla, depending on the desired block 
distribution for surgical anesthesia . Performed at the level of the brachial plexus 
trunks/divisions, which are located just superior to the first rib and posterior to the 
subclavian artery, supraclavicular blocks can  provide dense surgical anesthesia for 
procedures below the level of the shoulder and is often called the “spi[INVESTIGATOR_418876].”  
 
The phrenic nerve, which is comprised of the anterior branches of the C3 -C5 nerve roots 
and innervates the diaphragm, typi[INVESTIGATOR_418877]. Due to its close proximity to the brachial plexus, the phrenic 
nerve is often inadvertently blocked dur ing supraclavicular blocks, resulting in ipsilateral 
hemidiaphragmatic paresis (HDP) . Although this is usually well tolerated in most 
individuals, complications (such as insufficient ventilation) may arise in those with pre -
existing pulmonary impairments.   
 
With traditional landmark -based or nerve -stimulator techniques, the incidence of HDP 
following supraclavicular blocks has been reported to be 50 -67%.1 Ultrasound -guided 
techniques are thought to facilitate more precise deposition of local anesthetic and 
enable operators to use less volume to achieve a successful block. However, even with 
the utilization of ultrasound visualization, the incidence of HDP has been reported to be 
up to 60% after supraclavicular block.1,2  Furthermore, there is no established consensus 
regarding what volume of local should be used to achieve a successful supraclavicular 
block while also minimizing HDP. Kant et al.  estimated an ED 95 of 27 cc of 0.5% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_418878] a successful supraclavicular block but did not determine the 
level of corresponding HDP.[ADDRESS_528355] provided a mechanism with which to supplement the block if 
necessary.  
 
 
1.1.2  Phrenic Nerve Palsy (PNP) and HDP  
 
The left and right phrenic nerves are derived from cervical nerve roots C3 -C5 to 
innervate the corresponding sides of the diaphragm. Phrenic nerve palsy results in 
hemidiaphragm atic paresis (partial loss of excursion) or paralysis.  In patients without 
pre-existing respi[INVESTIGATOR_418879] a supraclavicular 
block, the contralateral hemidiaphragm and accessory muscles of respi[INVESTIGATOR_418880]. 
Therefore, patients are usually asymptomatic at rest but may experience dyspnea with 
exertion. Patients with underlying lung diseases (i.e. pneumonia, chronic obstructive 
pulmo nary disease) or respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517] (i.e. patients with neuromuscular disease, 
PNP of the contralateral side) already rely heavily on the accessory respi[INVESTIGATOR_418881] a 
supr aclavicular block. These patients may have dyspnea at rest and show signs of 
ventilatory failure (i.e. hypercapnia, hypoxemia) with HDP.  
 
1.1.3   Diaphragmatic Motion Assessed by [CONTACT_418888] -mode (M -mode) ultrasonography has been shown to be a  reliable modality for 
detecting anatomical or functional diaphragmatic abnormalities by [CONTACT_418889].4 Motion of the right hemidiaphragm is more reliably imaged 
than the left due to the smaller acoustic window of the spleen compared to the liver.  
 
1.1.4   Respi[INVESTIGATOR_418882] (VC) measured in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_418883] 
55% in patients with diaphragm paralysis.5  Measuring changes in VC can quantify the 
change in lung function  resulting from unilateral diaphragmatic paresis or paralysis.  
 
1.2  Rationale and Hypothesis  
 
The rationale of this study is to investigate the dose -response relationship between local 
anesthetic volume and ipsilateral HDP in patients undergoing u ltrasound -guided 
supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks for surgeries of the right upper extremity in an 
observer -blinded, prospective trial. In this study, we hypothesize that higher volumes of 
local anesthetic will be associated with an increased inciden ce of HDP. By [CONTACT_418890], this study aims to help practitioners safely administer 
supraclavicular blocks, particularly in high -risk patients with underlying lung disease or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517].  
 
1.3.1  Primary Objective  
 
To define  the dose -response relationship between local anesthetic volume and 
ipsilateral HDP in patients undergoing ultrasound -guided supraclavicular brachial plexus 
blocks.  
 
1.4  Patient Selection  
 
30 eligible patients undergoing right upper ex tremity surgery and eligible for 
supraclavicular blocks will be recruited from the inpatient units and surgery clinics of 
NewYork -Presby[CONTACT_194840]/Weill Cornell Medical Center.   
 
1.4.[ADDRESS_528356] meet all of the following criteria:  
 
i. Undergoing right upper extremity surgery with supraclavicular block as the 
primary anesthetic  
ii. Age ≥ 18 years of age  
iii. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status [ADDRESS_528357]:  
 
i. Patient refusal for supraclavicular block  
ii. Inability to give informed consent  
iii. Allergy to local anesthetics  
iv. Hemidiaphragmatic dysfunction, suspected or known PNP  
v. Neuromuscular disease  
vi. Obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease  
vii. Medical or anatomic contraindication to supraclavicular blockade as judged 
by [CONTACT_418891]. Pregnancy  
 
1.[ADDRESS_528358],  up to 0.03 mg/kg of midazolam may 
be given for sedation prior to the block .  In cases of extreme patient anxiety 
unresponsive to 0.03 mg/kg of midazolam, additional midazolam may be administered 
up to a total dose of 0.05 mg/kg.  The patient will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_418884] t he contralateral side, and the injection site will be disinfected with a 2% 
chlorhexidine and alcohol solution. The ultrasound  will be placed in the supraclavicular 
fossa to obtain a transverse cross -sectional view of the brachial plexus and subclavian 
artery. The skin and subcutaneous tissues will be infiltrated lateral to the probe with 2% 
lidocaine. Using an in -plane technique, a [ADDRESS_528359] the “corner pocket” at the 
junction of the first rib and subclavian artery.[ADDRESS_528360] the needle and 
perform additional injections for complete coverage of the brachial plexus. The local 
anesthetic will be a 2:1 mix of 1.5% mep ivacaine and 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], and the volume 
administered  will be determined per the continual reassessment method (CRM) 
protocol described below. Per clinical routine, all injections will be made in 5cc 
increments using frequent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], to test for i nadvertent intravascular needle 
placement as well as ascertaining the absence of high resistance indicative of a possible 
intraneural injection.  
 
1.5.[ADDRESS_528361] of the medial  arm using 10 cc of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . Given that this is a 
subcutaneous field block that does not contribute to PNP and HDP, all patients will 
receive the same amount of local to ensure adequate anesthesia.     
 
1.5.[ADDRESS_528362].  Patients will be examined in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_418885] a 
low intercostal or subcostal approach using the liver as an acoustic window. Patients wi ll 
be asked to perform a “voluntary sniff” (VS) test, for which they will be asked to 
forcefully inhale through the nose in a sniffing position. The above measurement will be 
performed immediately preceding the brachial plexus blockade, and then at [ADDRESS_528363] s.  
Diaphragmatic excursion from baseline will be measured in centimeters. Three 
measurements will be made, and the average will be taken. Significant 
hemidiaphragmatic paresis will be defined as greater than 75% reduction in 
diaphragmatic excursion, no mov ement, or paradoxical movement in the VS test.  
Partial paresis will be defined as a 25 -75% reduction in diaphragmatic excursion.   If the 
two reviewers come to different conclusions regarding the diagnosis of significant 
paresis, partial paresis, or no par esis, a third blinded anesthesiologist will review the 
images and serve as a “tie -breaker”.

Expi[INVESTIGATOR_1814] 1 second (FEV 1), and Peak Expi[INVESTIGATOR_1901] (PEF) prior to the block 
and 30 minutes after the block.   
 
1.5.6 Evaluation of Supraclavicular Block  
 
At 15 and 30 minutes, we will assess sensory blockade in the axillary (lateral upper arm), 
musculocutaneous (lateral forearm), ra dial (dorsal hand), median (thenar eminenece), 
and ulnar (hypothenar eminence) distributions with the use of ice and a 3 point scale (0 
= normal sensation of cold, 1 = perception of touch/pressure but not cold, 2 = no 
perception of touch/pressure, or cold) .2  Motor function will be  evaluated at 15 and 30 
minutes in the distribution of the axillary nerve ( abduction at shoulder ), 
musculocutaneous nerve (flexion at the elbow), radial nerve (extension at the elbow), 
median nerve (flexion at the wrist and opposition of the second finger and thumb), and 
ulnar nerve (opposition of the fifth finger and thumb). Motor block in each distrib ution 
will be graded on a 3 point scale (0 = normal strength, 1 = weakness, or 2 = no 
movement).[ADDRESS_528365]. During placement of the nerve block, a "catheter over 
needle" system will be  used  to place a catheter.  This catheter will be dosed with 
additional local  anesthetic if supplemental nerve blockade is needed to  provide 
satisfactory  anesthesia.  No additional procedure will be required.  The patient will 
proceed to surgery following successful sensory blockade of the above dermatomes.  
 
We will apply a 0 -10 point verbal rating scale to assess dyspnea at 30 minutes (0 = no 
difference from baseline, 10 = extreme difficulty breathing).   Oxygen saturation will also 
be measured off of supplemental oxygen [ADDRESS_528366] before the 
transfer.  
 
 
1.5.7 Continual Reassessment Method (CRM)  
 
The Continual Reassessmen t Method (CRM), developed by O’Q uigley et al .8 is a study 
design for dose -finding/Phase I studies.  It is different from traditional dose -escalation 
studies in that it “learns” from information gained at earlier time points in order to  limit 
patient exposure to non -efficacious and potentially toxic doses.   The general idea 
behind the CRM is that an a -priori dose -response curve (DR C) is assumed and a desired 
effec t rate chosen.  The estimated DR C is updated after each subject’s outcome is 
observed, so that the next patient’s dose is based on the information about how the 
previous patient tolerated the intervention. As the number of subjects accumulates , the 
DRC becomes based on observed data instead of the a -priori assumption s. [ADDRESS_528367] developed the 
following a -priori probabilities for signi ficant HDP after various doses of local anesthetic:  
 
Dose Level  Volume of Local 
Anesthetic (mL)  Probability of HDP  
[ADDRESS_528368] C has changed less than 10% af ter the final cohort.  If 
the DR C changes by [CONTACT_726] 10% after 3 0 subjects, additional subjec ts will be 
enrolled until the change is less than 10%.  
 
We anticipate that some of the lower volumes used  may not provide surgical 
anesthesia.  We will overcome this by [CONTACT_418892]’ blocks after US scan for 
diaphragm function, and if insufficient for anesthesia, we will supplement the blocks to 
insure complete coverage for the surgical procedure.  
 
1.6 Statistical Analysis  
 
Participant characteristics, such as age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 
score, and type of surgery will be characterized by [CONTACT_3163] (standard deviations) or 
medians (interquartile ranges), as appropriate.  
 
The dose -response curve of the l ocal anesthetic on HDP, as well as sequential dose 
allocation, will be calculated using Stata 13 IC’s CRM command (StataCorp, College 
Station, TX) and the BMA -CRM Simulator (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX).  
 
 
2.0  MANAGEMENT OF INTERCURRENT EVENTS  
 
2.1 Potential Risks  
 
2.1.1  Potential Risks of Supraclavicular Blocks  
 
Ultrasound -guided supraclavicular blocks are widely used and safe. In addition to 
ipsilateral phrenic nerve palsy, potential procedure -related side effects include 
ipsilateral oculosympathetic palsy (Horner’s syndrome) (incidence 1%) and recurrent 
laryngeal nerve palsy (1%), both of which are self -limited.  Rare procedure -related 
complications include subclavian artery puncture (0.4%), and pneumothorax (<0.1%).9  
Nerve palsies a re usually self -limited, and the risk of permanent neurological damage is 
rare (<0.01%).[ADDRESS_528369] of care for isolated 
upper extremity surgeries at our institution. Therefore, eligible subjects w ill incur no 
additional risks from participating in this study.   
 
2.1.2  Other Potential Risks  
 
No psychological risks to subjects are expected . In order to prevent loss of 
confidentiality, i nvestigators will keep subjects’ participation confidential to th e extent 
permitted by [CONTACT_2371].

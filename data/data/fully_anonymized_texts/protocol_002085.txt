1.  Purpose and objectives.           List the purpose and objectives:  
 
Specific Aim 1:   To assess if intubation without flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy  is possible in conventional double 
lumen tube (DLT) vs VivaSight DLT.  
 
Primary Hypothesis:  Cases utilizing the VivaSight will need fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 30% of cases versus 100% of 
cases with a conventional DLT.  
 
Specific Aim 2:   To assess the time to successful placement of the VivaSight DLT vs conventional DLT and compare 
the incidence of tube malposition in the two types of DLTs.   
 
Secondary Hypothesis:   The VivaSight DLT will take significantly less ti me to place compared with the conventional 
DLT.  Additionally, the incidence of malposition will be significantly less with the VivaSight.  
 
Specific Aim 3:  To determine the reduction in cost associated with using VivaSight DLTs compared to conventional 
DLT. 
 
Tertiary Hypothesis:   Use of the VivaSight DLT will reduce the cost of fiberoptic bronchoscopy purchasing and 
maintenance by 50%.

a. Background  
Thoracic surgery frequently involves single lung ventilation, which is most commonly achieved  with a double lumen 
endotracheal tube (DLT). Double lumen tubes are more difficult to insert than single lumen tubes because they are 
much larger and stiffer.  Malposition can lead to problems with lung deflation, difficulty with oxygenation and 
ventilati on, or cause airway injury [1] .  As auscultation alone is unreliable, the use of a flexible fiberoptic 
bronchoscope remains the gold standard for confirming correct placement of DLTs [2].  In one study, 35% of blindly 
inserted DLTs that were thought to be in correct position were found to be malpositioned upon fiberoptic  
bronchoscopic confirmation [3].  However, fiberoptic  bronchoscopes can be costly to acquire and maintain and 
may not be available in all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89879].  The VivaSight DLT is a FDA -approved device that is 
indicated for use in thoracic surgical patients to provide single lung ventilation. The VivaSight DLT has an integrated 
camera on the distal tip of the tracheal lumen, which is attached to a screen and permits continuous visualization 
of its position in the trachea.  In many cases, this may obviate the need to use flexible fiberoptic bronchos copy to

STU2018- 0098, Moon, Form A, Mod_4, 06- 18-19 (2)  [ADDRESS_98901] shown that time to placement for the VivaSight is 
significantly decreased compared to conventional DLTs [4].   
 
Placement of the VivaSight is significantly faster than traditional DLTs because continuous visualization during insertion eliminates the need for fiberoptic confirmation in the majority of cases. Due to the continuous visualization 
of its position, displacement from repositioning or surgical manipulation can be detected more quickly and therefore 
able to be rectified faster with VivaSight DLTs.  Many patients who are undergoing thoracic procedures have preexisting pulmonary disease.  This compounded with the need for single lung ventilation makes these patients 
very intolerant to malpositioned tubes or inadequate ventilation.  Being able to continuously visualize the position 
of the DLT may thus allow earlier identification and rectification of tube malposition for this vulnerable population of patients.  
 Both conventional DLT and the VivaSight DLT are made of polyvinylchloride and have similar size bronchial and tracheal cuffs.  A dis advantage of the VivaSight is that if secretions or blood cover the lens, it can be difficult to 
dislodge and therefore the view may become obscured.  It is easier to clean the tip of a fiberoptic bronchoscope since it can be removed from the airway.  Based on 6 months of clinical practice at Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the necessity of fiberoptic bronchoscopy use with VivaSight DLT is around 20% [unpublished data].  
 
 
b. Current practice  
The current clinical practice is to use either a conventional Mallinkrodt double lumen tube or a VivaSight DLT for 
thoracic cases.  This is usually up to the discretion of the anesthesia faculty, as both types of tubes are readily 
available.   
 
 
3.  Study Design.

Screening and Informed Consent  
A member of the research team will use a screening form to look for surgical patients that meet all the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. He/she will approach potential subjects in the preoperative area and the study will be explained in 
detail in a private room.  Patients will be informed that they will receive no compensation for participating in the study 
and there will be no adverse consequences if they choose not to participate. If the subjects agree to participate,

[EMAIL_1799], for inclusion in the patient’s medical record, per Parkland regulations. The study 
duration will be from the beginning of anesthesia care to postoperati ve (POD) 1.  
 
Anesthetic Protocol  
The anesthesia team that will be caring for the subject during surgery will be given the protocol for the study, which standardizes the general anesthetic technique.   
 
Subject Group Assignment  
A randomization schedule will be created by a member of the research team that is not involved in clinical care (i.e., 
statistician).  Subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_98903] double lumen endotracheal tube or a 
VivaSight double lumen endotracheal tube.  ETT size will be selected based on gender and height -   
• A woman shorter than 5’3” should be intubated with a 35- Fr tube  
• A woman taller than 5’3” should be intubated with a 37- Fr tube  
• A man shorter than 5’5” should be intubated with a 35-Fr tube  
• A man taller than 5’5” but shorter than 5’10” should be intubated with a 39- Fr tube  
• A man taller than 5’10” should be intubated with a [ADDRESS_98904] visualization of the tube’s position will be used to guide it into the correct 
position. The time that the facemask is taken off the patient’s face will be recorded as the ‘start time’ for laryngoscopy, and the ‘end time’ will be when the double lumen tube is verified to be in the correct position.  
 
Successful DLT placement will be defined as chest rise during ventilation, a square capnography waveform, bilateral 
breath sounds, and no air leakage. Details regarding tube placement including Cormack -Lehane grade, number of 
attempts, number of operations, and use of any adjunct airway devices will be recorded.  An independent investigator 
will evaluate and record all measurements and times.  The intubator will be asked to assess the procedural difficulty 
of intubation on a scale of 1-5- 1: very easy; 2: easy; 3: some difficulty; 4: significant difficulty; 5: impossible.  
 
When single lung ventilation becomes necessary, the anesthesia provider will inflate the bronchial cuff and clamp the 
respective lumen of DLT to provide single lung ventilation.  After the pleura is opened, the surgeon will be asked to 
rate the quality of lung collapse- 1: excellent; 2: fair; 3: poor.  At the conclusion of surgery, patients who meet 
extubation criteria will be extubated and taken to the PACU or ICU.  The duration of intubation will be r ecorded.  
 If the lens of the VivaSight becomes obscured, the anesthesia provider will be asked to take the following steps:  
1. Inject 20mL air into red injection port  
2. Connect 10mL syringe filled with [ADDRESS_98905] (twice- total 4mL)  
3. Connect 10mL syringe filled with [ADDRESS_98906] (twice)  
4. Connect empty 10mL syringe and suck the saline injected (twice)  
5. Confirm correct tube position with FOB.  
 
A blinded research assistant will perform all postoperative assessments. As patient -reported outcomes have become 
increasingly important for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], treatments that have the potential to increase patient satisfaction are being studied closely.  The postoperative quality recovery scale (PQRS) is a tool that assesses recovery over time and 
compares them to baseline values.  Some of the advantages of the PQRS are that it is validated, takes less than 5 minutes to administer, has a low patient refusal rate, and is acceptable to patients across a wide range of ages.  The 
PQRS will be administered at baseline in the preoperative area, and after PACU arrival at 45 minutes and on POD 1 
(Appendix 1).

2. Demographic information (age, weight, height, BMI, gender), medical and surgical history, ASA)  
3. Intraoperative parameters  
• Baseline vital signs upon arrival to operating room  
• Time of induction and intubation  
• Intraoperative vitals (systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures, heart rate)  
• Laryngoscopy details (Cormack Lehane view, blade used)  
4.  Adverse event monitoring  
• Airway injury  
• Patient unable to be intubated (e.g., difficult airway)

between 30% for the VivaSight versus 100% for the Mallinckrodt DLT. The study will have 90% power (two- sided 
chi-square test with type I error rate = 0.05).  Accounting for patient drop out and protocol deviations, the study will 
enroll a total of 50 subjects (25 in each group).    The continuous data will be summarized as mean and standard 
deviation or median and inter -quartile range, as appropriate while categorical data will be summar ized as frequency 
and percentages.   The incidence of FOB usage in the two groups will be compared using a chi -square test or 
Fisher’s exact test.   Statistical significance is set at p=0.05.

Purpose  – “Why is this study being done?”  
When patients have surgery on one of their lungs, the anesthesiologist needs to insert a special kind of 
breathing tube called a double lumen endotracheal tube (DLT). This special tube allows the 
anesthesiologist to breathe for one of your lungs (the lung that is not being operated on) while the 
surgeon fixes the other. A traditional DLT does not have any sort of camera attachment, so we have to 
insert a separate camera called a “fiberoptic bronchoscope” to confirm the correct placement of the 
DLT. Recently, a new kind of tube called the VivaSight has come on the market. The VivaSight has a 
camera on the end that is connected to a monitor .  The Vivasight’s  camera may decrease the time to

Placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube which is standard and would have been done even if 
you were not in the study (in the same timing and frequency ).  
Confirmation of correct tube placement either through fiberoptic bronchoscopy (if you get a standard double lumen tube) versus embedded camera (if you get a VivaSight double lumen tube)  
Occasional  rechecking of tube position throughout surgery, either with a fiberoptic bronchoscope or 
through the camera of the VivaSight.  
If the camera of the VivaSight becomes obscured, we may inject air or saline down the tube to try to un-obscure the view. 
In the recovery room, you will be asked a serious of questions pertaining to your pain level, nausea, 
anxiousness, sadness, and quality of recovery.  
  
Risks – “What are the risks of participation in the research?”  
 There is minimal risk to participating in this study, since the type of surgery you are going to have necessitates a double lumen tube.  There are standard risks associated with placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube such as sore throat, hoarseness, dental damage, and displacement but these

lumen tube.    The VivaSight tube is the same size as the traditional DLT. The only difference is the embedded camera at the tip of the tube.   
Loss of Confidentiality 
Any time information is collected; there is a potential risk for loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed. 
 Other Risks 
There may possibly be other side effects that are unknown at this time. If you are concerned about 
other unknown side effects, please discuss this with the researchers.  
 Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects.  However, the study doctors are not aware of all the side effects that you may experience.  Be sure to tell your study doctor  
immediately about any side effect(s) that you have while taking part in the study.  
For more information about risks and side effects, ask one of the researchers or study staff.  
There may be unforeseeable side effects, but given all previous studies and knowledge of this device, 
the study investigators feel there is minimal risk above what would already be there by [CONTACT_4907].  
 
 
Are the re Risks related to withdrawing from the study?  
 If you decide to withdraw from this study early, please discuss your decision with the principal investigator.  The researcher may ask you to complete study withdrawal procedures at a final study 
visit.  This visit includes assessments of pain, nausea, anxiousness, and recovery up until the time of 
study withdrawal.  There is no risk to you if you do not complete the final withdrawal procedures and you can choose not to participate in them.  Are there risks if you also participate in other research studies? Being in more than one research study at the same time, or even at different times, may increase the 
risk to you.  It may also affect the results of the studies.  You should not take part in more than one 
study without approval from the researchers.   
 What if a r esearch-related injury occurs?  
The researchers have taken steps to minimize any known or expected risks.  However, you may still 
experience problems or side effects, even though the researchers are careful to avoid them.  In the event of a research -related injury or if you experience an adverse reaction, please immediately contact 
[CONTACT_6814].  See the section “Contact [CONTACT_7171]” for phone numbers and additional information.  You may also need to tell your regular doctors.  
 
If you are injured as a result of taking part in this research study, medical care will be provided. T his 
care may be billed to you or your insurance. Depending on the circumstances, this care may be 
provided at no cost to you. We have no plans to give you money if you are injured. The investigator can 
provide you with more information.

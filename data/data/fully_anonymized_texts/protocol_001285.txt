4/21/2022  3 
  
Measurements  1. Venous blood sampling for pharmacokinetics: At 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 
180, and 240 minutes from the beginning of ondansetron infusion.  
2. A CSF sample will be obtained via lumbar puncture between 30 and 180 
minutes from the beginning of ondansetron infusion , for the 
assessment of Ondansetron concentration in the CSF using population 
PK approach.  
3. Vital signs (pulse oximetry , blood pressure) : before infusion and 30, 60, 
120, 180 and 240 minutes after end of ondansetron infusion.  
4. 12-lead ECG : At baseline and prior to discharge.  
5. Troponin: prior to discharge.   
6. Intensity of spontaneous pain (on 0 -10 NRS): At baseline, and a fter 
ondansetron administration; every 10 minutes for 60 minutes, every 15 
minutes thereafter for a total of 120 minutes, every 30 minutes until 
240 minutes,  hourly on the study day until bedtime, and daily for 3 
weeks thereafter.  
7. Neuropathic Pain Symptom  Inventory (NPSI) pain descriptors: Prior to 
and 70 minutes after ondansetron administration.  
Statistical 
Methodology  Primary Outcome:   
The primary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and the tolerability  
of ondansetron and tariquidar single dose iv co -administration  (in comparison 
to ondansetron administration alone) in patients with neuropathic pain.  
 
Secondary outcomes : 
1. Change in spontaneous pain intensity (measured on 0 -10 NRS) from 
baseline to [ADDRESS_826299] (or 
Wilcoxon signed -rank test, if data no t normally distributed).  
2. Changes in NPSI total score and sub-scores  (burning pain, paroxysmal 
pain, paresthesia /dysesthesia score ) will be compared between 
treatment sessions;  
3. The association between baseline Conditioned Pain Modulation ( CPM ) 
magnitude (ΔCPM) and the % pain reduction from baseline will be 
determined by [CONTACT_620857]. A significant association between 
the two measures will be indicative of differential analgesic response as 
a function of descending pain modulation;  
4. Exploratory analyses will be performed  to determine if variables such as  
sex, weight,  baseline wind -up ratio (WUR), peak ondansetron plasma 
concentration, and P -glyco protein  genotype affect the difference in 
pain reduction  between the two study sessions .

 2.  STUDY PROTOCOL  
 
2.1 Background and Significance  
Neuropathic pain (NeuP) affects more than  16 million Americans2 and results in considerable impairment in 
quality of life.3 Five of every six patients with NeuP do not achieve adequate pain relief with currently approved 
medications;[ADDRESS_826300] major safety concerns. 
Therefore, new therapeutic approaches ar e urgently needed to reduce the burden of NeuP.  
Serotonergic 5 -HT 3 receptors  (5-HT 3R) in the central nervous system (CNS) have been identified as a promising 
pharmacological target for neuropathic pain.5,[ADDRESS_826301] dorsal horn neurons through serotonin activity.7 However, a fter peripheral nerve 
damage, neurons in the dorsal horn demonstrate overexpre ssion of 5 -HT 3R, the only (excitatory) ion channels 
among serotonin receptors.6,8 As a result, the character of descending serotonergic modulation in NeuP can shift 
from inhibitory to excitatory (facilitatory).9,[ADDRESS_826302] that currently available 5 -HT 3R antagonists are substrates of efflux 
transporters such as the P -glycoprotein (Pgp), located at the capi[INVESTIGATOR_620834] -brain barrier (BBB) and blood -spi[INVESTIGATOR_620835] (BSCB).18,[ADDRESS_826303] that this efflux limits the CNS exposure to 
systemic 5 -HT 3R antagonists, preventing neuropathic pain relief.  By[CONTACT_620858] -mediated efflux is  expected to 
increase the concentrations of these drugs at their CNS sites of action and thus provide adeq uate relief in 
neuropathic pain.  
In addition to CNS penetration, the choice of appropriate pain condition and patient somatosensory 
characteristics are important for preventing a “ translational mismatch ” between preclinical and clinical study 
design.[ADDRESS_826304] patients exhibited e fficient inhibition (and 
not facilitation).[ADDRESS_826305] been published.30  
 
 
2.2 Preliminary Data  
Our preliminary data on conditioned pain modulation (CPM), a 
surrogate measure of descending inhibition vs. facilitation ( Fig. 1 ) 
demonstrate that while in healthy adults less than 20% exhibit descending 
facilitation, 40 -50% of patients with peripheral NeuP exhibit various 
degrees of descending facilitation. We expect to have sufficient balance 
between descending inhibition and facilitation among enrolled NeuP 
patients, to determine the association between this phenotype and pain 
reduction.  In a recent pharmacokinetic study of ondansetron disposition 
in the CSF, a 7-fold difference was observed betw een plasma and CSF 
concentrations of ondansetron after a single [ADDRESS_826306] also performed a series of experiments in rats to determine the 
distribution properties of ondansetron (in plasma, heart, and brain) in the 
setting of P-glycoprotein ( Pgp) genetic knockout (KO) or Pgp in hibition 
with tariquidar (Figure 2). Plasma concentrations (2A) of ondansetron 
were not different between wild type (WT) rats, Pgp KO rats, or after pre -administration of 15mg/kg tariquidar in

 wild -type rats.  Heart concentrations (2 B) of ondansetron in Pgp  KO rats compared with WT rats were not different 
at 30 and 60 -min time points, and were lower at 15 - and 120 -min time points. In rats pre -treated with tariquidar 
(only 1 -h time point available), the heart concentrations of ondansetron were not different f rom wild -type or Pgp 
knockout.  Brain concentrations  (2C) of ondansetron were higher in Pgp KO rats and in tariquidar -treated rats, 
compared with ondansetron administered to WT rats. There was no difference in brain concentrations between 
Pgp KO rats and r ats pre -treated with tariquidar.

2.4.1 Study Design  
 
Randomization and Blinding : The study is designed as a  prospective,  randomized, double -blind, cross -over 
experiment  in patients  with neuropathic pain . After signing informed consent and meeting eligibility criteria, 
participants will receive two 16 mg IV infusions of ondansetron, approximately 3 weeks apart. Participants will be 
randomized to the order of tariquidar (4mg/kg dose  in 500mL D5W ) and place bo (D5W solution ) co-administration 
with ondansetron.  
 
2.4.[ADDRESS_826312] Louis , via 
ads in the community, Epic -based (and IRB -approved) direct recruitment tools, and through Volunteer for Health 
(VFH) organization . Once the potential subject has contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] a member of the research team, a research 
coordinator will provide a description of the project either by [CONTACT_648], email or mail, at the discreti on of the potential 
subject. Potential subjects will be asked to undergo telephone screening by a trained research coordinator to assess 
preliminary eligibility for the study, although this may be done in person at the request of the volunteer.  
 
 The follo wing screening information will be collected by [CONTACT_648]: age, height and weight, known allergies, 
complete medical history, neuropathic pain description and intensity . Name [CONTACT_620881] .  
 
 Potential subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria during the telephone screening will be scheduled 
for a screening/consent visit at Washington University/Barnes -Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_620837]. The  
following will take place at the screening/consent visit, which will occur approximately [ADDRESS_826313] 
treatment study session:  
 
 Verbal discussion of the study procedures, benefits, and potential risks  
 Subjects reads, understands, and s igns informed consent  (subjects will also be provided with a written 
copy);  
 Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing age;  
 Brief history and physical, including vital signs, height and weight measurements , pain history and intensity, 
and medications ;  
 Blood draw for troponin, comprehensive  metabolic panel ( CMP) and complete blood count (CBC) ; if 
subject’s lab tests results are available within the past 30 days, we will utilize these . 
 12-lead ECG test to rule out QTc interval > 450ms  
 Completion  of the fo llowing questionnaires: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_620838] (HADS), and P ain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) , Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) , Color -
Word Matching Stroop Test (CWMST) ; 
 Completion of standardized pain test ing: conditioned pain modulation (CPM), wind -up ratio (WUR) to 
punctate mechanical stimulation, and quantitative sensory testing (QST) for cold, heat, mechanical, and 
vibration sensitivity.  
 Pain diary to track daily pain levels.  
 
 Women of childbearing potential with positive urine pregnancy test will be excluded from the study. Women 
of childbearing potential must agree not to try to become pregnant during the study period and [ADDRESS_826314] also use a highly effective birth control method (such as oral 
contraceptives, condoms, or intrauterine device) throughout and [ADDRESS_826315] study drug 
administration . 
 
Concomitant analgesic use : 
4/21/2022  10 
 Stable doses of analgesics or adjuvant pain medications such as  gabapentin, pregabalin , around the clock opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]  
(with a total daily dose not exceeding 50mg oral morphine equivalent ), except those listed in the exclusion criteria,  
will be allowed, as long as no dose change has occurred  2 weeks prior to the study. PRN analgesic use  (NSAIDs, 
short -acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], acetaminophen)  will not be allowed [ADDRESS_826316] the participants by 
[CONTACT_223243] a week during the washout period, and for 3 weeks after the second (crossover) intervention , to address 
any questions or conce rns the participants may have .  
 
SNRI neuropathic pain medications , tramadol, fentanyl and tapentadol  will not be allowed, per exclusion criteria.   
 
2.4.3 Study Period  
Participants  will be studied in the  Washington University Pain Center, or in the  Clinica l Research Unit (CRU) 
of Washington University School of Medicine, with continued presence of research and nursing personnel. The 
study will comprise three sessions over an approximately  28-day period  (Figure 2A) . As previously described, the 
screening visit will take place within about  [ADDRESS_826317] day 1.   
Intervention : 
Each participant will receive two IV infusions of o ndansetron , 3 weeks apart, in randomized order . Placebo 
(D5W) or tariquidar (4mg/kg dose in D5W) will be administered IV over 60 minutes  according to randomization 
schedule . Ondansetron will be diluted in 100mL D5W , and tariquidar will be diluted in 500mL D5W. Starting 30 
minutes after the initiation of tariquidar/placebo, a 15-min ondansetron co -infusion will be given, to time its peak 
brain concentration with potent Pgp inhibition (Figure 3). A 3 weeks  interval between the two sessions (> 5 half -
lives) wi ll allow the elimination of the first dose of ondansetron  and tariquidar . A [ADDRESS_826318] who has a 
QTc>450ms will not receive the se cond ondansetron dose and will be withdrawn from the study. A blood sample 
will be drawn at the 240 min time point for troponin levels. If troponin levels are elevated, the patient will be 
immediately evaluated by a physician and a cardiology consult will be obtained.  Further assessment and treatment 
of these subjects is described below in section 3, “M anagement of Intercurrent Events”.  
Vital signs (pulse oximetry and 3 -lead ECG; non -invasive blood pressure) will be monitored before infusion and 
approximately 30, 60, 120, [ADDRESS_826319] is positive.  Participants will complete a brief pain assessment, as well as WUR and  CPM 
testing at baseline  (Figure 2B) . Thereafter , two IV catheters will be inserted in participants’ arms. One will be utilized 
for drug infusion and the catheter in the contralateral arm will be used for serial blood sampling.  One 5-ml blood 
sample will be obtained for P -glycoprotein polymorphism analysis. At study visit 1 and study visit 2, a n additiona l 5-
ml baseline blood sample will be obtained for future research  with participant consent . Participants  will report 
baseline spontaneous pain (0 -10 NRS) and complete a baseline  NPSI. Placebo ( D5W solution ) or tariquidar (4mg/kg 
dose) will be administered IV over 60 minutes. Starting 30 minutes after  the initiation of tariquidar/placebo, a 15 -
min ondansetron co -infusion will be given, infused via Y -site, to time its peak brain concentration with Pgp 
inhibition.  The intensity of spontaneous pain (on 0 -10 NRS) will be assessed every 10 minutes for 60 minutes, and 
every 15 minutes thereafter for a total of 120 minutes, then every 30 min  for a total of 240 minutes. WUR and CPM 
testing will be repeated 90 minutes afte r the end of ondansetron infusion  (i.e., 105 minutes after the beginning of 
ondansetron infusion) . Participants will record self -reported pain hourly on the study day until bedtime, and daily 
for 3 weeks thereafter. NPSI pain descriptors will be assessed p rior to, and 70 minutes after , the beginning of 
ondansetron  infusion . Additionally, b lood samples for ondansetron concentrations will be obtained at baseline 
(time zero) and approximately at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 , and 240  minutes from the beginning of o ndansetron 
4/21/2022  11 
 infusion  (See Table 1 for full summary of the measurement schedule.) Plasma will be processed and stored in 
aliquots at -80°C until analysis.  A 3-mL CSF sample (per participant’s consent) will be obtained via lumbar puncture 
between [ADDRESS_826320] variability. The participants  and investigators  will be blinded to treatment al location 
sequence .

-In patients who are concomitantly treated with SSRI or SNRI  medications  that are allowed for inclusion (duloxetine 
≤60mg/day, citalopram ≤20mg/day , or Escitalopram ≤10mg/day,  additional assessments will be performed at the 
time of vital sign assessments ( baseline and 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after end of ondansetron infusion ) to 
evaluate confusion, restlessness, dilated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], muscle twitching or rigidity, and sweating. This will be performed 
to identify signs suggestive of serotonin syndrome.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Outcome Measures  
Secondary outcome measures include:  
1. Change in spontaneous pain intensity (measured on 0 -10 NRS) from baseline to [ADDRESS_826321] (or Wilcoxon signed -rank test, if data not normally distributed).  
2. Changes in NPSI total score and sub-scores  (burning pain, paroxysmal pain, paresthesia/dysesthesia s core ) 
will be compared between treatment sessions;  
3. The association between baseline Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) magnitude (ΔCPM) and the % pain 
reduction from baseline will be determined by [CONTACT_620857]. A significant association between the  
two measures will be indicative of differential analgesic response as a function of descending pain 
modulation;  
Exploratory analyses  will be performed  to determine if variables such as sex, weight, baseline wind -up ratio (WUR) , 
peak ondansetron plasma concentration, and P -glyco protein  genotype affect the difference in pain reduction  
between the two study sessions . 
A population PK approach will be used to model CSF concentrations of ondansetron with and without tariquidar co -
admin istration.

** CSF sample can be obtained  anywhere between [ADDRESS_826323] protocol,32 and include the assessment of mechanical detection threshold (MDT) with Semmes -
Weinstein monofilaments, mechanical pa in thresholds (MPT) with standardized weighted metal probes, cold and 
warm detection thresholds (CDT and WDT), as well as cold and heat pain threshold (CPT and HPT) with TSA -II, and 
vibration detection threshold (with standard tuning fork). QST tests will be performed in the area of maximum pain 
and a control, non -painful area.  
 
Thermal detection and thermal pain thresholds  
Equipment:  The Thermal Sensory Analyzer (TSA -II platform - Medoc, Ramat Yishai, Israel) will be used to determine 
thermal detection and  pain thresholds. This equipment is used globally for functional assessment of pain and 
temperature -conducting nerve fibers (C and A -delta fibers).  
 
Method and Background: Using the thermal sensory analyzer, cold and warm detection thresholds (CDT and WDT,  
respectively), as well as cold and heat pain thresholds (CPT and HPT, respectively) will be determined .33,[ADDRESS_826324] area of 9.0 cm2 is applied to the tested site, and all thresholds are determined by 
[CONTACT_338229][INVESTIGATOR_338215] 32°C baseline tem perature by 1°C/s until the subject presses the ‘stop‘ 
button. Cut -off temperatures are 0°C and 50°C, to minimize thermal damage to the skin. The baseline temperature 
to which the thermode returns before each test is 32°C. The average threshold is calculat ed from three 
measurements in each area.  
 
Determination of mechanical detection threshold (MDT)  
Equipment: A set of standardised Semmes -Weinstein mono filaments (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 
256mN). The contact [CONTACT_620859] (<1 mm²) and texture.  
 
Methods and Background: Standardised Semmes -Weinstein mono filaments will be used in a modified “method of 
limits” manner using 3 series of increasing and decreasing stimulus intensities to determine the geometric average 
as the tactile detection threshold of the affected and unaffected skin areas 35. 
Monof ilaments of different stimulus intensities are used to determine the tactile detection thresholds. A  filament 
eliciting 16mN force* is applied first, followed by [CONTACT_620860]. This respective force represents the first threshold value. The order in which the 
stimuli are applied is then reversed and stimuli of consecutively greater intensity are applied until sensation is 
detected (this intensity becomes the second value). Again filaments with decreasing intensity are applied until in 
total 3 upper and lower values of detection are fulfilled from which the mechanical detection threshold can be 
determined.  
4/21/2022  14 
 * In case the first filament with  an intensity of 16mN is not detected, the next highest intensity filament which can 
be detected must be used as a starting intensity.  However, the relevant force of this stimulus is not documented. 
Filaments with consecutively lower intensity are applied until the patient cannot detect the stimulus being applied. 
The procedure is followed as above; until in total 3 upper and lower value s of detection are fulfilled from which the 
mechanical detection threshold can be determined.  
 
Determination of mechanical pain thresholds (MPT)  
Equipment:  A set of standardized weighted metal probes (Nervetest, MRC systems) exerting pressure of 8, 16, 32,  
64, 128, 256 and 512 mN.  
 
 
Methods and Background:  
The standardized metal probes will be used in a modified method of levels manner, [ADDRESS_826325] the mechanical pain threshold.  Beginning with an applied force of 8 mN, stimuli increase in 
intensity until the sensation induced by [CONTACT_405377] d pressure can be described as “sharp” . The corresponding force is 
used to represent the first MPT value. The stimuli are the applied in the descending order, until the sensation 
indu ced by [CONTACT_620861] “blunt”. The procedure is then repeated a total of 3 times and until a to tal of 6  
values are obtained, from which the mean MPT is determined.  
 
Determination of vibration detection thresholds (VDT)  
Equipment:  A standard tuni ng fork . 
Methods and Background:  
The tuning fork will be applied at the lateral malleolus, and vibration detection threshold (the moment patient stops 
feeling the vibration of the tuning fork applied to the skin) will be measured on a scale of [ADDRESS_826326] will be 
repeated a total 3 time s. VDT is determined as an average of the three measures.  
 
Determination of wind -up ratio (WUR ) 
Equipment:  A standardized weighted metal probe (Nervetest, MRC systems) exerting pressure of 256 mN. 
Methods and Background:  
Wind -up ratio (WUR)  to punctate mechanical stimulation (i.e. temporal summation) will be measured as another 
surrogate of descending facilitation. WUR will be assessed by a published protocol.32,[ADDRESS_826327] a 256mN pi[INVESTIGATOR_620839] (Nervetest, MRC systems, [LOCATION_013]) is first applied singularly and then  as a series of 10 identical stimuli with 
1Hz frequency within an area of 1 cm2. Immediately following the single and 10 stimuli, participants rate their pain 
on a 0 -10 NRS, and a ratio is calculated using these values. This procedure is repeated twice; a geometric ‘wind -up’ 
average is calculated from the two ratios.  
 
Determination of conditioned pain modulation (CPM)  
Equipment : A thermostat -controlled digital water bath; The Thermal Sensory Analyzer (TSA -II platform - Medoc, 
Ramat Yishai, Israel)  
Methods and Background:  
Conditioned pain modulation (CPM)  is a surrogate measure of descending inhibition vs. facilitation. CPM efficiency 
is derived from a patient report of pain intensity following application of a calibrated painful stimulus (called te st 
stimulus) with and without  another ongoing unpleasant stimulus (called conditioning stimulus). The intensity of the 
conditioning and pain stimulus will be determined individually by [CONTACT_620862] 30-
70 on 0 -100 NRS (con ditioning), and hot temperature that elicits pain intensity of 60 on 0 -100 NRS (test).  
The conditioning stimulus will be applied by [CONTACT_620863] -dominant  or non -affected  arm in a cold thermostat -
controlled water bath . The initial temperature will be set to +8°C. If that temperature elicits pain intensity between 
30-70 on 0 -100 NRS, the CPM protocol will use +8°C conditioning. Alternatively, water temperature will be adjusted 
in 2°C increments (lowest will be 2°C) to elicit pain in that range.  
The prev iously determined Pain -[ADDRESS_826328] stimulus will be applied at the dominant  or affected forearm, using a 3x3 
cm Peltier thermode connected to TSA -sensory analyzer (Medoc Inc, Ramat Yishai, Israel) .  
4/21/2022  15 
 The length of the conditioning is 60 seconds ; during the last  [ADDRESS_826329] stimulus intensity with and without conditioning is defined as CPM magnitude. CPM>0 (i.e. increased 
pain to test stimulus following conditioning) implies descending pain facilitation .37,38  
 
 
2.4.7   Statistical Methods  
 
All demographic, sensory, analytical and patient -reported data will be captured on case report forms, manually 
entered to a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database that will be created for the project , and will be 
verified by [CONTACT_620864] . Plasma and CSF concentrations of ondansetron will be analyzed 
using a previously validated liquid chromatography method .[ADDRESS_826330] for paired samples.  McNemar’s test will 
be used to compare paired nominal data, and Fisher’s exact test to compare non -paired nominal data.   
 
Sample size:  
Change in spontaneous pain reduction (secondary outcome) was used to determine the sample size for the study. 
The baseline pain intensity (±SD) of patients with peripheral neuropathy we have recruited to various studies over 
the past two years have been 6. 3±2.1. This proof of conc ept study expects to demonstrate a 30% difference in 
pain reduction between the two intervention sessions. Given that in a published study of IV ondansetron in NeuP 
a 20% pain reduction has been observed (although not different fro m placebo), we assume pain intensity of 
5.1+2.1 in ondansetron+placebo group, and expect  pain intensity of 4.0+2.1 in ondansetron+tariquidar group at 
the 60 -120 minute time frame . To determin e a significant difference with two-tailed α<0.05 and 85% power (e ffect 
size 0.52), [ADDRESS_826331] to  enroll 28-32 participants  to the study 
to reach 28  evaluable participants . 
 
3.0 Management of Intercurrent Events  
 
3.1 Adverse Experiences  
The investigator s will closely monitor subjects for evidence of systemic adverse events.  All adverse events will be 
reported and followed until satisfactory resolution.  The description of the adverse experience will include the time 
of onset, duration, severity, etiology , relationship to the study drug (none, unlikely, possible, probable, highly 
probable), and any treatment required.  Participants  will notify the monitoring physician/RN coordinator of any 
adverse expe rience during the study period.  
At discharge, subjects w ill be provided with contact [CONTACT_620865].

If DLT is observed in >2 participants, o ndansetron dose will be reduced to 12 mg for all new participants .  
If further DLT is observed in >2 participants receiving 12 mg ondansetron, the dose will be reduced to 8 mg for all 
new participants.  
 
3.3 Premature withdrawal  from a study for a single patient  
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detr imental to the patient’s health and/or the 
patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the participant will be withdrawn from the study  and the 
reason(s) for withdrawal  documented in the case report forms.  
 
Any participant will be withdrawn from  the study  in the following scenarios:

treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
 Suspected or confirmed pregnancy  
 Serious non -compliance with the study protocol  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Patient withdraws consent  
 Investigator removes the patient from study  
 Investigator decides to close the study  
 
4/21/[ADDRESS_826332], the study team will discuss premature termination of 
the study with Washington University IRB and the FDA.  
 
If more than 7 participants mee t the early withdrawal criteria, due to serious or non -serious adverse effects , the 
study will meet the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].  
 
3.5 Potential Risks  
 
3.5.1 Potential risks for intravenous (IV) catheter placement  
Placement of the intravenous catheter can cause a brief, generally mild period of pain lasting for a few seconds at 
the site of catheter placement. There is the potential that the first attempt at venous cannulation will be 
unsuccessful and the patient wil l require multiple attempts to place the IV. Intravenous catheter placement can 
cause a bruise, though in patients without known bleeding diathesis this is usually mild and self -resolving. Some 
individuals experience dizziness or lightheadedness. Other com plications are rarer. Infection from a cleanly -placed 
IV is rare, especially given the short anticipated duration of catheter retention. There is the chance of the catheter 
becoming dislodged from the vein and infiltrating the contents flowing through it i nto the muscle or subcutaneous 
fat. As only a minimal amount of fluid will flow through the vein and no caustic or vasoactive substances will be 
used (except in the case of a rare, potentially serious adverse event), this presents no risk to the volunteer.  
 
3.5.2 Potential risks from lumbar puncture  
Lumbar Puncture (LP) is widely used technique of CSF sample aspi[INVESTIGATOR_620840]. LP is a major diagnostic tool used in neurological clinics as relatively  safe method to obtain 
CSF sample for further analysis. The important complication of LP is post -lumbar puncture headache (PLPH) 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_233488] a week after LP. In a multisite international trial , 9% of 3868 enrolled patients reported PLPH ,40 
with  0.3% patients requiring and epi[INVESTIGATOR_122501] (procedure of introducing autologous blood into epi[INVESTIGATOR_341006]).  Other adverse events were non -specific headache (10.2%), back pain  (17%), nausea and/or vomiting (2.5%), 
dizziness 45 (1.3%). Other possible complications may include bleeding as well as temporary or permanent 
neurological damage, although these are extre mely rare. Management of these potential adverse events are 
described below in section 3.4.  
 
3.5.3 Potential risks from blood collection  
The total amount of blood collected during each study visit is approximately 60  mL (  about 10% of a standard blood 
donation) , which should not have adverse physiological effects . As described above, the IV catheter placement  
necessary for blood draws may  cause bleeding, bruising, pain,  dizziness/lightheadedness, or (very rarely) infection.    
 
3.5.[ADDRESS_826333] common reported side ef fects (~10%) include headache, constipation,  and fatigue. Less 
common (<10%) include drowsiness, diarrhea, fever, anxiety, transient liver enzyme increases, or burning at 
4/21/2022  18 
 injection site. Rare side effects (<1%) include cardiac arrhythmias, ECG changes, dry  mouth, anaphylaxis, transient 
blindness, and hypokalemia.  
The FDA has issued a drug safety communication regarding the risk of QTc prolongation and potential 
progression to torsades de pointes. The risk of cardiac side effects was determined to be dose -dependent with a 
maximum QTc prolongation by 20msec after 32mg IV administration; consequently, 32mg IV doses are no longer 
approved. 16mg IV infusion doses (as proposed in this study) are still approved and frequently used for 
chemotherapy -induced nausea a nd vomiting. Risk of arrhythmia is increased by [CONTACT_620866]: congenital 
long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking concomitant medications that 
prolong the QT interval. All such patients would be excluded b y our proposed exclusion criteria. Additionally, in our 
recent study, none of the 15 subjects who received 16mg intravenous ondansetron (meeting the same 
inclusion/exclusion criteria as in this study), experienced arrhythmias or any other serious side effe cts 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
3.5.[ADDRESS_826334] generation inhibitor of P -glycoprotein, currently in 
development by [CONTACT_620867]. In a Phase I study in healthy volunteers, intravenous tariquidar 
doses in the range of 0.1 -2mg/kg did not cause any adverse effects.41 
In healthy volunteers, a 2mg/kg intravenous dose resulted in no serious adverse effects. Two of ten 
subjects receiving this dose developed mild metallic taste during tari quidar infusion. Two subjects who received a 
4mg/kg dose experienced light -headedness and conjunctival infection. One subject developed a brief syncopal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_620841] a PET -scan procedure, resolved without sequelae.  A 6mg/kg intravenous dose resulted in mi ld 
metallic taste and nausea that resolved after the infusion was stopped.42 
In healthy volunteers receiving 4, 6  or 8mg/kg intravenous tariquidar doses, no serious adverse events 
have been observed.43 Overall , four cases of hematoma and one case of phlebitis due to cannulation , as well as 
five cases of metallic taste in the mouth occurred. Other adverse drug effects to tariquidar were vertigo (two), 
bradycardia (one) and headache (one). Heart rate, blood pressure as well as ECG did not significantly change 
during and after tariquidar administration. No subject had any significant change in blood chemistries (including 
electrolyt es, liver and renal function tests), complete blood count and coagulation over the whole study period. 
No volunteer discontinued prematurely the study. In one case, for safety reasons the infusion was stopped 20 min 
before the scheduled end due to moderate orthostatic hypotension and vertigo.43 
In an additional healthy volunteer study testing intravenous tariquidar doses in a range of 3 -8 mg/kg, 
adverse events possibly/probably related to tariquidar included 1) dysgeusia (changes in the sense of taste) in 
6/20 subjects, across 3mg/kg, 4mg/kg, 6mg/kg and 8 mg/kg doses; 2) vertigo in 3/20 subjects receiving 3mg/kg 
(n=1) and 8mg/kg (n=2) doses; 3) headache (n=1, 6mg/kg dose); and 4) hypotension and bradycardia (n=1, 
8mg/kg; infusion stopped after 7.2mg/kg w as infused).  
Seven clinical studies of the pharmacokinetics and efficacy  of tariquidar have been completed in cancer 
patients. The main use of tariquidar in these clinical trials has been to enhance BBB -penetration and tumor -
penetration of Pgp -substrate chemotherapy agents, to improve the efficacy  of cancer chemotherapy. In th ese 
studies, tariquidar have been shown to increase the severity of known side effects of chemotherapeutic agents , 
including hematological abnormalities such as anemia and thrombocytopenia . No additional side effects other 
than those known to be associated  with chemotherapy have been identified in patients who have received 
tariquidar (Tariquidar Investigator’s Brochure).  
Each ampoule of Tariquidar for injection contains 10 mL of 7.5 mg/mL tariquidar  (as the dimesylate salt, in 
a sterile solution of 20% et hanol/80% propylene glycol with a small amount of hydrochloric acid)  for a total of 75 
mg tariquidar free base per ampoule. Ampoules will be stored refrigerated (2 -8°C) and protected from light. Within 
4 hours prior to  administration, the tariquidar soluti on will be diluted aseptically  by [CONTACT_620868] 5% dextrose in water (D5W) to give a final volume of 250 mL. The diluted solution 
will be protected from light until infusion is complete.  
 
3.5.6 Potential risks from tariquidar  and ondansetron combination  
 
4/21/[ADDRESS_826335] of adverse events were not related with 
study drugs, but to intrathecal catheterization.  QTc changes ater On dansetron and Ondansetron+ Tariquidar 
administrations were insignificant: mean QTc change was -2.5 ms ( ±16.1) after Day 1 and 2.9 ms ( ±12.9) after Day 
2, p=0.67 (see Table 2).

3.5.7  Potential risks from thermal testing  
Risk of injury related to thermal pain testing is minimal.  Thermal testing is widely used and considered safe.  While 
thermal testing does produce pain, risks to the individual are minimal, because 1) the pain is transient in nature and 
generally subsides  immediately after the procedure; 2) subjects are instructed that they may stop any procedure at 
any time with no adverse consequences; and 3) the level of pain experienced by [CONTACT_252272].  
With thermal stimulation there is a ve ry slight risk of a burn, but this is minimized by [CONTACT_716]: 1) positive lockout 
of stimulus parameters above 52°C; and 2) the stimulator has built in a shut -down system to prevent the delivery of 
prolonged or high intensity stimuli.  The TSA -II therm al devices have FDA 501(k) clearance (K922052). CPM testing is 
conducted using an ice water bath at 8°C and exposure is limited, thereby [CONTACT_620869].  
 
3.[ADDRESS_826337], within the limits 
of the Washington University compensation plan.  
Subjects will be instructed at the beginning of the visit that they can alert the investigator any time they experience 
bothersome si de effects. In particular, they will be instructed to immediately report palpi[INVESTIGATOR_620842]/lightheadedness. Continuous physiologic monitoring (ECG, pulse oximetry, and intermittent non -invasive 
blood pressure) will be used from the beginning of dru g infusion until [ADDRESS_826338] to confidentiality; 1) all subjects will be assigned a study ID number, 2) Samples will be kept 
4/21/2022  20 
 confidentially.  They will be coded, with a key to the code linking code numbers to names kept at a separate location, 
under lock and key.  3) The link to identifiers will be destroyed at the end of the s tudy. 4) Data will be stored under 
lock and key (office, file cabinet) and only the investigators and research team will have access.  If data are 
published, there will be no link to identifiers.  Study data will not be revealed to any organization, indivi duals other 
than the subjects, or the subjects themselves. 5) Study data will not be entered in subjects' medical records.  
 
3.6.[ADDRESS_826339] a 12-lead ECG performed at 
the screening visit.  Subjects with QTc>450msec or any arrhythmia will be excluded. Potential subjects that would 
be at elevated risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_620843] -associated arrhythmia (e.g.,  current us e of QT -prolonging 
medication) are ineligible for this study. The ondansetron dose used (16mg IV infused over 15min) is approved and 
commonly used with chemotherapy. Subjects will be monitored with telemetry from the beginning of drug infusion 
until 2 hrs after infusion is complete. If arrhythmias or  prolonged QT develop at any time during the study, subjects 
will be immediately assessed by a physician . If ECG abnormalities are mild (e.g., infrequent premature 
atrial/ventricular contractions or QTc>450ms bu t <500ms), subjects will be monitored in the pain management 
center by [CONTACT_620870] 4 hrs. If the signs/symptoms meet the severity criteria 
described in Section 3.2 (“ Premature discontinuation of protocol for a single patient” ), the patient will be withdrawn 
from the study and sent to the Barnes -Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_620844] (ED) for further evaluation , including 
cardiology consultation or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], as needed . 
 
3.6.[ADDRESS_826340] -lumbar puncture headache (PLPH)  
Lumbar puncture and sampling procedure will conducted in a way to minimize the effect of risk factors 
contributing PLPH development. Particularly, an atraumatic needle of 25 G diameter will be used  for LP procedure.  
Passive withdrawal of CSF is known as associated with a lower risk for headache , therefore active withdraw with 
syringe will be avoided left only for  rare cases . 
 Subjects will be asked to notify clinical personnel immediately if they develop a headache while in the 
clinical research unit. Additionally, the periodic nursing assessment (see supplementary document) will include 
questions about headache. If a particip ant endorses new -onset headache, the anesthesiologist will be notified. The 
anesthesiologist will perform a brief history and physical exam to determine whether or not the symptoms suggest 
PLPH. If P LPH is likely and symptoms are mild, conservative treatme nt will be initiated. The participant  will be 
encouraged to lie in a comfortable position and drink fluids. The subject will also be offered analgesics including 
acetaminophen/butalbital/caffeine (e.g. Fioricet®), ibuprofen, or acetaminophen alone. IV flui ds or medication will 
be reserved for subjects who cannot tolerate oral administration due to nausea/vomiting. If symptoms are severe 
(e.g. uncontrollable nausea/vomiting, severe subject distress), the subject will be removed from the study and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_620845] (procedure described below).  
Discharge paperwork will include clear descriptions of P LPH and instructions about whom to contact [CONTACT_620871]. If a subject reports likely P LPH by [CONTACT_620872] a f ollow -up phone call, 
symptom severity will be assessed. Conservative  treatment (as described above) will be offered  for the first 24 -48 
hrs. If unresolved, the participants will be brought to the Clinical Research Unit for further evaluation or treatment 
per discretion of the investigators which could include a potential epi[INVESTIGATOR_620846], performed by 
[CONTACT_620873].  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_620847]. Sterile technique (including 
chlorhexidine swabs, caps, masks, and sterile gloves)  is used at all steps by [CONTACT_620874]. First, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_620848] a standard Tuohy needle and loss -of-resistance technique.  Next, 20ml of the subject’s blood 
is drawn  and then injected through the Tuohy needle.  Injection is stopped if the subject complains of pressure or 
paresthesia that could indicate compression of the cauda equina.  
 
3.6.3 Prevention of drug -drug interactions between study drugs and concomitant ly used  antidepressants  
 
Citalopram, Escitalopram and Duloxetine are not known to produce clinically meaningful interactions when 
combined with potent P -gp or CYP3A4 inhibitors. When tested specifically in combination with P -gp inhibitors such 
4/21/2022  21 
 as simeprevir, cyclo sporine, and verapamil, meaningful interactions were NOT identified for escitalopram and 
duloxetine44-46.  Given that tariquidar is a selective P -gp inhibitor (and possibly weak CYP3A4 inhibitor), we do not 
expect any meaningful interactions with citalopram, escitalopram, or duloxetine.  
 
Table 3  outlines the potential of drug interactions between SSRI/SNRI an tidepressants in the context of use with P -
gp inhibitors, and served as a basis for inclusion/exclusion of particular SSRI/SNRI antidepressants.

 For patient safety, we will limit maximally allowable doses of citalopram , escitalopram  and duloxetine  in enrolled 
participants to 50% of FDA -approved maximum dose, eg, 20mg for citalopram , 10mg for escitalopram  and 60mg 
for duloxetine . 
Due to possible interactions with other SSRI/SNRI medication, we will exclude  patients taking other SSRI/SNRI 
medications such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine . 
 
3.6.4 Prevention, diagnosis and management of other lumbar puncture -related complications  
The potential complication of epi[INVESTIGATOR_620849]40. 
To minimize the risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_110116], subjects will be asked over the phone and at the in -person screeni ng 
visit about a history of clotting disorders, easy bleeding/bruising, liver disease, or use of anticoagulants. A complete 
blood count will be drawn during the screening visit to rule out thrombocytopenia. Any potential subject with 
abnormalities on histo ry or lab work will be excluded from the study.  
To minimize the risk of infection or nerve damage  from lumbar puncture , the procedure  will be done  by 
[CONTACT_620875] (board -certified or board -eligible anesthesiologists) under sterile cond itions. 
Specifically, the subject’s lumbar region will be sterilized with a chlorhexidine swab, a sterile drape will be placed, 
the anesthesiologist will wear sterile gloves, all personnel in the room will wear a cap and mask, and a  dressing will 
be applie d after LP. Subjects will be instructed to notify the anesthesiologist of the occurrence and resolution of 
any paresthesias during LP procedure . If symptoms are severe (e.g., severe pain, motor deficits) the subject will be 
sent to the BJH ED for further e valuation including neurology consultation, imaging, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], as 
needed. Subjects with temporary, minor paresthesias during placement may continue with the study.

(DSMB) for data safety and monitoring for this study.  The potential risks are attributable to the [ADDRESS_826344] of human studies; three  board -certified 
anesthesiologists pain management specialists as co -investigators , all of them with extensive clinical experience  
and research experience .  
 
4.[ADDRESS_826345] recruitment tools,  and the Volunteer for Health organization . 
Data on comorbidities and concomitant medication use are provided by [CONTACT_1766]. Specimens include blood obtained 
exclusively for determining ondansetron  concentration , and an additional blood sample is obtained for determining 
4/21/[ADDRESS_826346] in the study . Subjects will be given verbal 
(initially) and then written descriptions of the study aims, procedures, risks, and benefits, and will be required to 
give written informe d consent. A member of the study  team provides all study descriptions, informed consent, and 
answers all questions. Subjects are informed verbally and in writing that participation is voluntary and they may 
refuse to participate and may withdraw from the study at any time without penalty.  
 
4.4 Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others  
Study subjects could potentially experience improvement in neuropathic pain. Society could  benefit from 
development  of a novel treatment for neur opathic pain . 
 
4.5 Inclusion of Women  
Both women and men suffer from neuropathic pain and thus will be included in this study.  
 
4.6 Inclusion of Minorities  
All of our studies actively encourage the participation of minorities in the research.  Our minority recruiting typi[INVESTIGATOR_620850] (78% white, 21% Black , <1 % Hispanic).  
 
4.7 Inclusion of Children  
Children <18 years of age  will not be studied in this investigation. Neuropathic pain is uncommon in this age group, 
and i ncluding children may expose them to an unnecessary risk without the benefit of generali zability of the r esults.

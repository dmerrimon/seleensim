Trial Design   
This study was a single -site, single -blind randomized controlled trial comparing home -base d 
therapy with RehabTouch  to conventional therapy for individuals in the subacute phase of stroke . 
RehabTouch  is a commercial home rehabilitation technology (sold as FitMi ® by [CONTACT_342819] ) 
designed to  put in to practice  clinically  recommended design features for at -home rehabilitation 
tech nology.  The study  was performed at Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center  in 
Downey, CA . Participants were invited for an initial assessment to confirm they met the inclusion 
criteria and to establish baseline measures.  Participants provided informed  written  consent . 
Qualifying participants were randomly assigned to either the RehabTouch  group or the 
conventional group. Participants in both groups were instructed t o perform self -guided therapy 
for at least three  hours/week for three consecutive weeks. All p articipants received weekly 
phone calls from a supervising therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] . After the three -week  exercise period, participants 
returned for a n end-of-therapy  assessment  and to return study materials . Participants returned 
one month later for a follow -up assessment . The trial was pre -registered on ClinicalTrials.gov 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  and approved by  [CONTACT_342820], Inc. Institutional Review Board 
at Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center (IRB #263 ).  
 
Participants  
Inclusion criteria  were: experienced one or more strokes between 2 weeks and 4 months prior; 
baseline UEFM Score >5 and ≤55 out of 66; absence of moderate to severe pain defined as  a score 
of 4 or lower on the 10 point visual -analog pain scale; ability to understand the instructio ns to 
operate RehabTouch ; and aged 18 to 85 years old, as older age could be a confounding variable. 
Exclusion criteria  were: concurrent severe medical problems that precluded the individual from 
participating in routine rehabilitation; visual deficits defined as a score >1 on question 3 of the 
NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS); severe cognitive deficits or apraxia defined as a score >0 on questions 
1a and 1c of the NIHSS; severe neglect defined as a score >1 on question 11 of the NIHSS; severe 
aphasia defined as a score  >1 on question 9 of the NIHSS; and enrollment in other therapy studies. 
Recruitment aimed to balance the age, ethnicity, and gender of the study participants to be 
representative of Los Angeles County in [LOCATION_004], [LOCATION_003].  All participants provided informed 
consent.   
Using an estimated effect  size of 1.05 based on long -term follow -up data from a previous arm 
training study during subacute stroke ,[1] power analysis established that 21 participants in each 
group would provide a 90% chance of detecting a significant difference between RehabTouch  
and conventional therapy at the 0.05 significance level (two -tailed t -test). To account for 2 0% 
dropout, the target sample size was n = 25 participants in each group.  
Adaptive randomization was used to ensure matched levels of impairment between the 
RehabTouch  and conventional therapy groups. Specifically, subjects were stratified by [CONTACT_342821] i nto three levels (i.e. 5 -22, 23 -39, 40 -55) and then randomized by [CONTACT_342822] .[2] 
 
Intervention  
Participants randomized to the RehabTouch  group  were given a RehabTouch  system with the 
custom  10” touchscreen tablet. They received [ADDRESS_424558] on how to perform the selected exercises  correctly .  
After the 3 -week exercise period, participa nts returned for an end-of-therapy  assessment. At this 
assessment, participants returned the RehabTouch  system or the sensorized booklet of exercises 
for data collection. Participants return ed one month later for a follow -up assessment.  
 
Outcomes  
The primary  outcome measure was the change in U pper Extremity Fugl -Meyer (U EFM ) score [3] 
from baseline assessment to one -month follow -up. UEFM was assessed at baseline, end-of-
therapy, and one -month follow -up. Secondary measures included the B ox and Blocks Test ,[4] the 
[ADDRESS_424559] ,[5] the Modified Ashworth Spasticity (MAS) scale [6] for the elbow, wrist, and 
fingers , and the Visual Analog Pain (VAP) scale for the upper extremity, all of which were assessed 
at baseline, end-of-therapy , and one -month follow -up. Motor Activity Log  (MAL)  was measured 
at end -of-therapy and one -month follow -up to assess self -reported quantity and quality of 
movement .[7] The European Quality o f Life  five dimensions, three levels ( EQ-5D-3L) and its 
companion Visual Analog Scale  (EQ-VAS) were measured at end-of-therapy  and at one -month 
follow -up to assess overall perceived health state ,[8], [9]  and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory 
(IMI) [10] categories of Interest/Enjoyment, Value/Usefulness, and Effort/Importance were 
measured at end-of-therapy  to assess participants ’ perceived motivation . These measures are 
widely used in stroke rehab ilitation research and have good sensitivity and reliability. All 
assessments were performed by a blinded, trained evaluator.  
To assess adherence, the RehabTouch  software recorded the date, time, and number of 
repetitions completed for each exercise, and the ex ercise booklet was placed in a sensorized 
folder that measured the times at which the participants opened the booklet.   
 
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses were performed using Matlab R2020 software. Change in UE FM score from 
baseline assessment to one -month follow -up w as compared between the RehabTouch  group and 
conventional therapy group using a n unpaired  two-tailed t -test. Three participant s in the 
conventional therapy group did not perform their one -month follow -up a ssessment ; one of these 
did perform the end -of-therapy assessment . For this one participant, the  missing one-month 
follow -up data point was imputed for the primary outcome measure by [CONTACT_342823]-of-
therapy  to one -month follow -up to this participant's end-of-therapy  UEFM score. All other 
analyses were performed using only data from participants who completed all three  
assessments.   
MAS score s were grouped by [CONTACT_342824]. We quantified i tems marked with a ‘+,’ with an additional  0.5 points 
for calculations.  EQ-5D-L3 was analyzed following .[8], [9]  IMI categories were compared across 
groups using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. For the s econdary outco mes with baseline assessments , 
differences between groups at baseline and  at one-month follow -up were assessed using 
unpaired, two -tailed t -tests . Within group  changes from baseline to end-of-therapy and  baseline 
to one-month follow -up were compared using  paired , two-tailed t -tests. For the secondary 
outcomes without baseline assessments, end-of-therapy scores were compared to one-month 
follow -up scores using paired, two -tailed t -tests .  
To assess the ability of RehabTouch  to motivate an appr opriately high dose of home therapy, we 
performed a post -hoc exploratory analysis comparing the to tal number of repetitions that 
RehabTouch  participants completed to a theoretical target dose of 2,700 repetitions. A dose of 
2,700 repetitions of UE exercise corresponds to 300 repetitions/hour  (5 reps/minute)  over [ADDRESS_424560] 
in a rodent  model of stroke .[11] 
Certain participants were missing data at one or more time points for the secondary outcomes 
MAS, VAP and IMI. If a participant's record for a given measure  was missing data, that participant 
was omitted from any analysis for that measure. Thus,  for MAS calculations ( RehabTouch  n=13 
and conventional n=8), for VAP analysis ( RehabTouch  n=12 and conventional n=9), and for IMI 
analysis ( RehabTouch  n=13 , and conventional n=11 ).    
 
Interim Analysis  
Due to the unexpected additional risks to participating in this study due to  the COVID -19 
pandemic , an unplanned interim futility/efficacy analysis of the primary outcome measure was 
conducted after recruitment w as halted in March 2020. Group labels were removed, and the 
analysis was reviewed by [CONTACT_38430]. For the futility analysis, a conditional 
power of 20% was selected. For the efficacy analysis, a P -value of 0.033 was selected using the 
Lan-DeMets alpha spending function for the Pocock boundary (n=27 out of a planned 50 at 
interim analysis) .[12]

t1/[ADDRESS_1054789] several years, th ere has been an incre asing volume of patient s in the  United Stat es (US)  who 
undergo o pen radical prostat ectomy or robotic -assisted radical prostatectomy for  high -risk prostate 
cancer. Based on several published retrospective reports [1, 2], there may be ev idence of  improved 
disease- free survival out comes fo r this high -risk cohort compared to outcomes obtaine d with 
conventional radiotherapy approaches in conjunction with long-term androgen deprivation therapy. 
Concomitant with these pr actic e trends in the US, there has been an increasing number of ref errals for 
salvage r adiotherapy due to th e manifestation of detectable prostate -specific antigen ( PSA) levels, which 
become apparent after surgery. The observation of an increased number of case s with re lapsing d isease 
is not surpris ing, as the risk of bio chemical failure amo ng patients with high -grade disease or o ther high -
risk factors treated with surgery alone have ranged from 40 -80% in published reports [ 3-5]. While such 
patients are oft en su bsequentl y treated  with sal vage radiotherapy, the likelihood o f maintaining an 
undetectable PSA at two years after such treatment is often less than 40% in treated patients [6 , 7]. As 
evidenced from the relatively low biochemical control rates for this coh ort of pa tients, we believe that a 
significant percentage of p atients do not benef it from salvage radiation therapy ( SRT) using standard 
treatment techniques because of the p resence of extra -pelvic micro -metastatic disease. The increasing 
number of hi gh-risk patien ts who de velop relapsing disea se after surgery curren tly represents a ser ious 
clinical problem . Thus, superior im aging modality for advanced new ly diagno sed prostate cancer is 
clearly needed.     
 The primary barrier and challenge facing urologic oncologis ts is the  accurate  ident ificat ion of the source 
of the rising  PSA in the post -prostatectomy setting. Current imag ing modalities do not perform with high 
sensitivity , as far as detecting local or regional recurrence with sensitivity or specificity. This concern is 
furthe r comp ounded by [CONTACT_768900]. Based on 
published guidelines [ 4 8], SRT is routinely administered to patients with the m anifestation of a rising 
detectable PSA , which is of ten noted at  levels of 0.1 -0.5 ng/ml. Especially at these low PSA levels 
indicative of early relapse,  standard imaging studies such as MRI, CT scans, and bone scans are often  
associat ed with a low yield o f detecting positive imagin g findings of < 10% and it is unclear  if the more 
recent use of whole body MRIs provide any further information as to the sites of metastatic disease 
especially in the setting of early biochemical re lapse. Clea rly, improved and m ore sensitive imaging 
modal ities are desperately nee ded to help identify patie nts w ith early disease relapse that is non -
metastatic, who would then be suitable cand idates for local-regional SRT. 
 We can hypothesize that the us e of PSMA  PET imaging will pr ovide information about the site of 
recu rrence that can be used t o select patient fo r SRT and adjust SRT target volumes. It should be noted 
that especially for high -risk patients with biochemically relapsing disease, routine st aging wor k-up would 
inclu de b one scan and CT/MRI imaging.  Nevertheles s, the yield on these studies in the setting  of early 
relapse disease has been l ow. 
 Although  choline or fluciclovine  have  improved our ability to  detect recurrent and metastatic prostat e 
cancer  by [CONTACT_768901] m etabolome that is upregulat ed in prosta te cancer . Specifically, fluciclovine 
(18F) uptake is related to increased amino acid transport that  has been demonstrated to occur with 
68Ga-PSMA- 11 PET in Patients with Prostate Cancer  12  
Serial Number 000 2 
  
 
prostate cancer (14).  Both  C-11 choline and fluciclovine ( 18F) are now FDA appro ved and have become a 
de-facto standard  of care. Yet, there a re additional cell lev el imaging biomarkers that  are also 
upregulated in prostate cancer and may be exploited for i maging. One  of these promising new targets is 
pros tate specific membrane antigen  (PSMA) ( 15). PSMA is a Typ e 2 transmembrane glycoprotein of t he 
M28 peptidase family and is significantly overexpressed  on the cell surface of prostate cancer ( 16,1 7). 
PSM A therefore provides a promising target for PC -specific imaging  and therapy. 68Ga-labelled PSMA 
ligand suggests  that this n ovel tracer can detect PC  relapses and metas tases with high contra st by  
[CONTACT_667814], followed by [CONTACT_768902]. A meta- analysis p ublished in 
2016 (9) describing 1 8 studies with  effica cy and safety , 5 of which, with histopa thology correlation of the 
positive lesions,  reported an improved sensitivity and specificity of PSMA radiolabeled with 68Ga (68Ga-
PSMA-HBED -CC or [68Ga]-PSMA -11) over choline.  
 
Evidence has demon strated the superiori ty of 68Ga-PSMA- 11 PET/CT in staging of the high or 
intermediate risk prostate cancer patients  (18, 19-22). In one study, 68Ga-PSMA -11  PET/CT showed 
considerable change in staging and management of prostate cancer pat ients compar ed to conventional 
stagin g (19). The findings of this study supported the replacement of the conventional Bone scan and CT 
by 68Ga-PSMA- 11  PET/CT  (19). In a prospective study, it  was repo rted that 68Ga-PSMA -11  PET/CT 
changed the disease stage in 6 9% of the patients  (18). It was concluded tha t 68Ga-PSMA- 11  PET/CT can  
greatly impact the staging an d management of  prostate cancer patients  outside the two classic 
indications (b ioch emical recurrence and pre -surgical staging)   (18). A recen t review of 11 studies 
including 904 pat ients represented 68Ga-PSMA- 11  PET/CT as a  promising test for preoperative lymph 
node staging in intermediate/ high risk patients with prostate cancer  (20, 21) . The resu lts of the largest 
high -risk cohort for primary prostate cancer staging with 68Ga-PSMA- 11 PET/CT have recently been 
published  (21). In th is study comprising 691 newly diagnosed high -risk prostate cancer patients, 68Ga-
PSMA-11  PET/CT de tected  the advanced disease in 35 pe rcen t of the patients  (21). The specificity for 
lymph node metastasis detection on 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT in the pelvic lymph node dissect ion cohor t 
has been reported t o be very hig h (96.6%) (21). A study on 1253  men was  conducted to assess the risk of  
metastatic  disease on 68Ga-PSMA- 11 PET/CT at prostate cancer  diagnosis  and the results supported the 
use of 68Ga-PSMA- 11 PET/CT to detect metastasis and staging (22).  Finally, A multicenter, two -arm, 
randomized study has been co nduc ted and i nvestig ated wheth er 68Ga-PSMA- 11  PET/CT has improved 
accuracy when compared to the conventional imaging (CT and bone scan)  (23). C ollective data from this 
study and oth ers provide evide nce that 68Ga-PSMA- 11  PET/CT is better and can replace conventional 
imaging with bone scan and CT for staging patients with high -risk prostate cancer before surgery or 
radiotherapy . 
 Ther e i 
s significant clinical need to provide high  risk prostate cancer patients and those with biochemical 
relapse access to 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET imaging, and becau se of the excep tional performance that this 
imaging has shown for prostate cancer stagin g and the det ection of  recurrent prostate cancer , it has 
clear potential to transform clinical management of patients with prostate cancer. While FDA recently 
appro ved 68Ga-PSMA- 11 at UCSF a nd UCLA , it is  not approved beyond these two institutions  and is n ot 
currently  commercially available.  This generates the need for a study at  the University of Colorado  
Anschutz for ex panded acc ess use . 
 Similarly, the 
18F PSMA bi nding ligand , 18F DCF -PyL (PYLARIFY®  or pi[INVESTIGATOR_169724] F 18 ), has shown high 
accuracy in detection o f prostate cancer in the above indications  (24, 25) and rece ntly receive d FD A

6. ADV ERSE EVENTS  AND REP ORTING REQUIREMENTS 
6.1 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Pharmacologic effects of 68Ga-PSMA -11 
68Ga-PSMA- 11 has be en in jected for  PET imaging in more th an 2,616 published  patients [ 11] and the 
safety profile has been well establis hed.  Currently , no serious  adverse events related to drug have b een 
reported . This is expected because the mass of compo und is minimal, les s tha n 25 micro grams. There is 
a potential small risk of infection at the site of injection.  
 
Safety evaluation  
AEs will be collected during injection and uptake phase (50 -100 min) of Ga -68 PSMA -11 PET/CT scan.  All 
safety events will be recorded up to [ADDRESS_1054801] inje ction.  
 
Analyses will be performed for all patients receiving Ga-68 PSMA -11.  The study will use the CTCAE v 5.0

As part of this scan there is radiation delivered from the 68Ga and from the  low dose CT scan tha t are 
performed  as part of the PET/CT for attenuation correction and co -registration. Although any e xposur e 
to ion izing radiation has the  potential to cause some harm to tissu e, the radiatio n exposures in this 
study are comparable to t he low -level exposures associated with common diagnostic procedu res such as 
CT scanning. There remains a low theoretical risk o f develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a can cer at som e point later in life as a 
result of the radiation exposure received in this study. This risk is much  smaller than the clinical risks 
posed by [CONTACT_102]’s current cancer or the salvage radiation therapy the patient w ould be re ceiving.  
Participants should  not father a baby [CONTACT_56035]. A cceptable birth  control methods include 
abstinence, double b arrier method, surgic ally sterilized  patient or partner.

Monitoring and Oversight  
The sponsor investigator will be responsible for monitoring the trial per the trial monitoring plan,  in 
addition to overseeing the safety and efficacy of the trial including any specimens collected, executing 
the data and safety monitoring (DSM) plan, and complying with all reporting requirements to local and federal authorities. This oversight will be accomplished through additional oversight from the Data and Safety Monitoring C ommittee (DSMC) at the University of Colorado Cancer Center (CU Cancer Center). 
The DSMC is responsible for ensuring data quality and study participant safety for all clinical st udies at 
the CU Cancer Center, which is the coordinating institution of this trial. A summary of the DSMC’s activities is as follows:  
68Ga-PSMA- 11 PET in Patients with Prostate Cancer  20  
Serial Number 000 2 
  
 
• Conduct of internal audits  
• Ongoing review of all serious adverse events (SAEs) and unanticipated problems (UAPs)  
• May submit recommendations for corrective actions to the CU Cancer Center’s Executive Committee  
Per the CU Cancer Center Institutional DSM Plan, SAEs and UAPs are reported to the DSMC, IRB and the 
sponsor investigator per protocol. All SAEs and UAPs are t o be reported to the DSMC within 7 (for fatal 
or life -threatening events) or 1 5 (non -life-threatening events) calendar days of the sponsor investigator 
receiving notification of the occurrence.  
Each subject’s treatment outcomes will be discussed by [CONTACT_3899] e PI [INVESTIGATOR_589885]. Data regarding num ber of subjects, significant toxicities, dose modifications, and 
treatment responses will be discussed and documented in the meeting’s minutes.  
The sponsor investigator will provide a DSM progress report to the CU Cancer Center DSMC on a 
recurring basis ( either every six or twelve months based on DSMC vote). The DSM report will include a 
protocol summary, current enrollment numbers, summary of toxicity data to include specific SA Es, UAPs 
and AEs, any dose modifications, all protocol deviations, and protoco l amendments. The DSM progress 
report submitted to the DSMC will also include, if applicable, the results of any efficacy data analysis 
conducted. Results and recommendations from the review of this progress report by [CONTACT_768906] a DSMC review letter. The sponsor investigator is then responsible for ensuring this letter is submitted to the site’s IRB of record at the time of IRB co ntinuing 
review.  
6.[ADDRESS_1054804] a caus al relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can ther efore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or  disea se tempo rally asso ciated wit h the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whet her or not cons idered related to the medi cinal (investigational) product.  
 For this study, AEs are regarded as 'treatment emergent', if they occur after treatment has  been 
administ ered .

one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Note: Hospi [INVESTIGATOR_768896] a planned procedure/disease treat ment is not con sidered an SAE.   SAE 
reporting is require d as soon as the participant signs consent.  
6.2.3  EXPEDITED REPORT ING 
Reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
If a death oc curs durin g the trea tmen t phase of the study or within 30 day s after the las t administratio n 
of the study drug(s) and  it is determined to be related either to the study dr ug(s) or to a study 
procedure, the Investigator or his/her designee mus t noti fy the D SMC Chair (or qualified alternate) 
within [ADDRESS_1054805] may be by [CONTACT_14223] e -mail.  
Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Admini stration  
If the study is being conducted under an IND, the Sponsor -Inve stigat or is r esponsible for determ ining 
whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for expedited reporting in  accordance 
with Federal Regulations (21  CFR §312.32).   
SAE reporting will comply with U niversity of Colorado Anschutz Medica l Center SOPs and with local and 
federal regulations.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_1054806] be  determin ed for each AE, according to the criteria given in Section 7.3.3.  
Intensity /Severity  
The intensity of an AE is classified  according to NCI -CTCAE version 5.0, taking into accoun t the possible 
range of the intensi ty of the event:  
 
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 1 (mild) 
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 (moderate)  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade  3 (severe)  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 4  (life-threatening)  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 5 (fatal) 
68Ga-PSMA- [ADDRESS_1054807] udy drug action to resolve the AEs is to be docum ented as follo ws: 
• Drug withdrawn  
• Dose redu ced 
• Dose not changed  
• Other action (stoppe d: definitely, temporarily wit h exact d ates)  
 
Any potential study drug action to resolve the AEs is to be documented in free text in the CRF, e.g. , 'dose 
inter rupted', 'dose  interrupted a nd re -started'.  
6.2.5  RELAT IONS HIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
The possib le causal relationship between the AE a nd the administration of the study drug is  classified 
according to the following ques tion:  
 
“Is there a reasonable likelihood that the  event was caused by [CONTACT_1758] d rug?”  
 Possible answers are:  
• Related (plausib le tim e relationship to the administ ration of  IMP/RP. No plausible explanation 
by [CONTACT_768907]/ concurrent disease or o ther drugs/events) ,  
• Possible (plausible time rel ationship to the administrat ion of IMP/RP, but  the AE ca n be  also 
plausibly explained by t he unde rlying/concurrent disease or o ther medi cinal products  / events),  
• Unlikely (unlik ely te mporal relationship to the administration of IMP/RP. Other medicinal 
products, events,  and the under lying/concurrent d isease pro vide  a plausible explanation)  
• Not relate d (clear evidence that the AE is not co nnected to the IMP/RP administration)  
• Not assessable (no evaluation pos sible based on present data, additional clarifica tion and 
follo w-up necessary ) 
Causal relationship to study c onduct  
The possible causal rela tionsh ip between the AE and any stud y-co nduct -related procedures and 
activities require d by t he protocol is classified according to the following question:  
  “Is the re a reasonabl e likelihood t hat the event was caused by [CONTACT_50467]? ” 
 Possible answ ers are  “related”, “not related”, “no t assessa ble”.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_1054808] ration of stud y drug may be

initial irritation, the presence of an indwe lling cannul a is usually pain less and hardl y noticeable. The 
same applies to s ingle vein pun ctures for blo od sampling.  
 
Patients may a lso experience discomfort from lyin g in t he camera, e.g.,  back pain.  
 
Expected Ad verse Drug Reactions  
The definition below follows ICH -GCP (see also ICH  Guideline for  Clinical Safety Data Management: 
Definitions an d Standards for  Expedited Reporti ng): 
Adver se drug reaction (ADR)  
In the pre -approva l clinical experience with a n ew medici nal product or its new usages, particularly as 
the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all noxious and unintend ed responses to a medicinal 
product related to any dose s houl d be considered as ADR. The p hrase 'r esponses to a medicinal produc t' 
means that a causal relationship between a medic inal product  and an AE is at least a reason able 
possibility, i.e., the relati onship cannot be ruled out.  
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reac tions 
An unexpected adverse drug re action  is defined as any adverse drug e xperie nce, the nature, specificity 
or severity o f which is n ot consistent with the applicab le product information ( e.g.,  inve stigator’s 
brochure for an unapproved investigat ional prod uct or Summary of Product Charac teristics  for an 
approved product). “Un expected”  as used in this definition refers to an adverse drug experience that 
has not been previously observed and included in  the product i nformation, rather than from the 
perspective of such experience not being an ticipated  from the pharmacological prop erties of  the 
investigational product.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_1054809] prac tices and 
procedur es. These are described in the following s ections.  
6.2.8  DATA COLLECTION, MONITORI NG, AND  TRANSFER  
 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the s ite under the supervision of the site 
investigator. The investi gator is responsible for ens uring the accuracy, completeness, l egibility, and 
timeliness of the dat a reported.  
 All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accu rate interpretation 
of data.    Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] t he study visit w orksheets will be provided f or use as source document worksh eets for 
recording data for each partic ipant enr olled in the study.  Data recorded in the electronic case repo rt 
form ( eCRF) derived from source documents should be c onsistent with  the data record ed on the source 
documents.  
 Clinical data including advers e events , concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data 
and clinical laboratory data will be  entered into the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_768897]  (EPIC) .  
68Ga-PSMA- [ADDRESS_1054810]  protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range 
checks , to iden tify da ta that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered 
directly fro m th e source documents.  
6.2.9  QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 The Sponsor will perform a clinical review to d efine  the level of resolution requ ired of each d ata field, 
with major safety fields (e .g., AE) given the highes t importance.  
 
The database  will be 100% verified against the CRFs. A clinical review  will be perf ormed at Sponsor to 
identify those minor issue s that could remain unresolved.  
 
Serious AE data  in the Sponsor’ clini cal safety database  will be reconciled to  the original clinical 
manag ement  database.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_1054811] listings and complete narrative de scriptions of SAE s. 
Results  of the safety -related data analysis will be expressed as medians (or me ans) broken down into

Study Title: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in Patients with Prostate Cancer
You are being asked to be in a research study.   This form provides you with information about 
the study. A member of the research team will describe this study to you and answer all of your 
questions. Please read the information below and ask questions about anything you don’t 
understand before deciding whether or not to take part. 
Why is this study being done?
This study is 
being performed to provide clinical access to the prostate cancer imaging agent 
68Ga-PSMA-11 for positron emission
 tomography (PET) imaging in patients with prostate 
cancer at the University of Colorado.  
You are being asked to be in this research study  because this prostate cancer imaging agent, 
68Ga-PSMA-11, is either currently not available for clinical use, or is not yet approved by [CONTACT_5212] (FDA).
You will be monitored by [CONTACT_768909].  
Other people in this study
Up 
to [ADDRESS_1054820] already received this 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging agent with no
 reported 
serious adverse events.  
What happens if I join this study?
If you join the study, you will undergo a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET / CT  or 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/ MRI 
study depending upon your specific situation.  In general, if your doctor suspects any cancer in 
your prostate gland, your doctor may recommend a PET / MRI.  If have previously been treated 
by [CONTACT_768910] a PET / CT scan.  
The study will last approximately 2 hours or less.  An intravenous catheter will be inserted, 3-
7mCi of 68Ga-PSMA-11 will be administered through the catheter over less than 30 seconds, 
and then a waiting period (uptake time) of approximately 60 minutes will occur before scanning. 
Prior to scanning, you will be asked to empty your bladder, and then the scan will be performed 
which will take approximately 30-45 minutes.
We will observe you during this entire period, and then the study will be  finished.

Page 2 of 6What are the discomforts and risks of the study procedures?
Risks of Insertion of the intravenous catheter. In this study we will insert an intravenous 
catheter, connected to
 a plastic tube, into a vein in your arm.  We will use the tube to administer 
the 68Ga-PSMA-11.  You will feel some pain when we first insert the tube into your vein.  You 
may have some redness, swelling, or bruising where the tube goes under your skin.  In some 
cases, this type of tube can cause an infection where it goes under the skin.  In rare cases, it 
can cause a blood clot in the vein.  
Risks of Computed Tomography (CT).  As part of this study, we may perform a CT scan of your 
chest, abdomen, pelvic area.  CT is a way of taking detailed pi[INVESTIGATOR_262707] X-
rays.  X-rays are a type of radiation. You get some radiation from your environment.  You get 
radiation from bricks and concrete, from some foods, and from radon gas, which is an invisible gas 
that seeps out of the ground.  The amount of radiation that this CT scan will deliver to your body 
(give you) is about the same as you would get from living in your environment for 5 years.
This is an estimate.  The amount of radiation you get could be higher or lower, depending on the 
machine, the power setting, and your body weight.  Exposure to radiation at high levels increases a 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_50876].  There is no evidence of such risks for diagnostic procedures. 
The risk of this procedure is not equal for everyone.  The risk is much lower for people over 
the age of 30.
Risks of Having an MRI
In this study we may perform Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) of your head, chest, abdomen, 
pelvic area and extremities, if indicated.  The MRI machine uses powerful magnetic waves to take 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_262706].  The waves themselves are not harmful, but they can cause metal to heat 
up and electronics to stop working.  
You should NOT have an MRI if you have metal or electronic devices inside your body.  
Heart pacemakers and insulin pumps are examples of electronic devices.
The MRI machine is a small round tube.  It might make you uncomfortable if you do not like tight 
spaces.  
The most common side effect of having an MRI is flashing lights in the eyes.  This is caused by [CONTACT_768911].  Some people also experience warmth and reddening of the 
skin.  This usually goes away after a few minutes. 
MRIs may be done with or without contrast. The contrast solution may cause an allergic 
reaction. Severe allergic reactions can be life threatening. MRI contrast solution can cause 
kidney damage, especially if you are diabetic, dehydrated (lost body water) or elderly.  
Risks of 68Ga-PSMA-11 Positron Emission Tomography  (PET) 
A small amount  (3-7mCi) of radioactive substance (radiotracer) 68Ga PSMA ,-11 will be 
injected into your bloodstream.  The PET  scanner works by [CONTACT_768912].
Everyone is exposed  to radiation everyday of  their lives (background radiation).   The  doses that 
are used in a PET scan carry a possible risk of causing cancer at a later date (as does your 
exposure to background radiation),  but the risk is very low.   The amount of radiation that this 
68Ga PSMA-11 radiotracer will deliver to your body (give you) is about the same as you would 
get from living in your environment for [ADDRESS_1054821] your information, but it can not be guaranteed.
What are the possible benefits of the study?
This study is 
designed to provide 68Ga PSMA-11 PET imaging information for patients with 
prostate cancer.  
The results
 of the 68Ga PSMA-11 PET study  will be available to your doctors to use for your 
care. 
Are there alternative treatments? 
Currently, there are no alternative 68Ga PSMA-[ADDRESS_1054822] 
these other choices available to you. 
Who is paying for this study?

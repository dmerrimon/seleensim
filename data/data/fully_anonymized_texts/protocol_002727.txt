 1. INTRODUCTION:   
1.1 Amyloidosis: 
The amyloidoses are a diverse group of protein misfolding diseases wherein proteins 
aggregate and form fibrillar deposits (amyloid) in tissues.1 Examples of amyloid diseases 
include Alzheimer’s disease, hereditar y transthyretrin -associated familial amyloid 
polyneuropathy, dialysis related amyloidosis, AA amyloidosis with chronic systemic 
inflammatory states and immunoglobulin -derived AL amyloidosis. Human amyloid-
associated illnesses pose a therapeutic challenge s ince amyloid is a long-lived protein and 
there are no approved drugs demonstrated to disrupt pre-formed amyloid.  
AL amyloidosis is a malignant plasma cell disease  characterized by [CONTACT_255179] l plasma cells.[ADDRESS_310145] on pre-formed amyloid (see below). 
1.2 Tetracyclines :  
The tetracyclines are a well -established family of broad- spectrum antimicrobials first isolated 
from Streptomyces aureofaciens  in [ADDRESS_310146], tetracyclines, including doxycycline, possess the 
ability to inhibit members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of endopeptidases. The MMPs are zinc-dependent proteases involved in a gamut of physiological and 
pathophysiological processes such as embryogenesis, tissue remodeling, inflammation and 
tumor invasion.
4 It is hypothesized that overproduction of MMPs can result in AL renal and 
cardiac damage.5,6 High levels of MMPs appear to correlate with diastolic dysfunction and 
clinical manifestations of AL cardiomyopathy.6 Doxycycline-induced inhibition of MMPs 
appears to be beneficial in conditions associated with pathologic MMP-mediated proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, including cardiac remodeling, periodontitis, arthritis and cancer.

 Owing to its lipophilicity, doxycycline also concentrates in organs at sites of injury including 
gums in gingivitis, brain in meningitis and the myocardium in infarcts.10  
1.3 Doxycycline effects in Amyloidosis: 
The first report of the anti -amyloidogenic activity of doxycycline was suggested in a study of 
Alzheimer’s disease.11 Forloni, et al, showed that co-incubation of tetracyclines with β 1-42 
synthetic peptide, which is highly represented in Alzheimer amyloid deposits, resulted in a) marked reduction of amyloid fibril formation, b) inhibition of amyloid aggregation and c) de-
fibrillogenic effect against pre -formed amyloid fibrils.
[ADDRESS_310147], et al, showed that doxycycline 
can inhibit amyloid fibril aggregation and can destroy preformed amyloid in vitro and in a 
transgenic murine AL model.16 
1.4 Clinical experience with Doxycycline:  
Doxycycline is well- tolerated and safe, and is widely used in clinical practice for 
antibacterial prophylaxis, community acquired pneumonia and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. It is also efficacious in unusual infections such as Lyme disease, cholera, 
syphilis, plague and malaria.[ADDRESS_310148] profile of doxycycline is well -studied. 
Prolonged doxycycline administration at doses of 100 -200 mg daily for 6-24 months is well tolerated.
17-19 Commonly described adverse events with doxycycline use are cutaneous 
photosensitivity and self- limiting non -specific gastrointestinal symptoms.18,19 Within our 
oncology practice, doxycycline is commonly used in patients with solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies for anti- microbial prophylaxis in the setting of chemotherapy -
induced neutropenia, particularly in patients with penicillin allergies with good tolerance.17,20

 1.5 Clinical data of Doxycycline in Amyloidosis: 
There are limited but positive data suggesting an anti-amyloid efficacy of doxycycline in 
humans. Montagna, et al, treated [ADDRESS_310149]-transplant setting.
20 Doxycycline is currently being studied in patients with familial amyloid 
polyneuropathy. 
1.6 Limitations of current AL amyloidosis therapy: 
The current paradigm of AL amyloid treatment is focused upon eradicating the underlying 
malignant plasma cell clone with cytotoxic agents. This produces a hematologic response by 
[CONTACT_255180]. Treatments range from high dose therapy with autologous ste m cell 
transplantation in eligible patients, or anti- myeloma chemotherapy regimens such as 
melphalan/dexamethasone.[ADDRESS_310150] excellent anti -plasma cell 
efficacy in amyloidosis but are also associated with organ and tissue toxicity making their 
use in clinical practice challenging, particularly in advanced AL disease.32  Treatment of AL 
amyloidosis thus remains a frustrating journey for patients and their treating physicians, where clinically tenuous and frail patients with compromised vital organ function are tre ated 
with cytotoxic chemotherapy that often rapi[INVESTIGATOR_255169] (i.e. hematologic response) but does not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_255170].  Many of these patients 
succumb to organ failure despi[INVESTIGATOR_255171].  Indeed, in many pati ents with 
advanced stage cardiac amyloidosis, use of newer anti-myeloma drugs such as lenalidomide and bortezomib causes an initial worsening in cardiac biomarkers and even death.
25,30,[ADDRESS_310151] a 40% r isk of mortality in the first year 
following diagnosis, a number that has not changed since the 1970s (Figure 1) [ADDRESS_310152] year following diagnosis, 40% of patients die with no change in the 
three time periods.2 
As outlined above, there is a clear need to identify treatments that do more than eradicate 
the malignant clone (the primary objective of anti- myeloma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) to improve the 
high early mortality that occurs even while on “effective” chemotherapy. Thus, consideration of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_255172]- amyloid treatment by 
[CONTACT_255181]. The compelling preclinical data of doxycycline’s potential to benefit amyloidosis support prospective investigation of testing the use of 
doxycycline for AL amyloidosis treatment. The current study aims to generate key safety 
and efficacy data of doxycycline administration to AL amyloidosis patients. Our patients will potentially benefit from a novel mechanism of anti- amyloid effect i n conjunction 
with anti- plasma cell chemotherapy with minimal additional risks and side -effects and, 
perhaps, even an added benefit of simultaneous anti- microbial activity.

 1.7 Study Rationale: 
Organ response to anti- plasma cell therapy in AL amyloidosis  lags behind hematologic 
response as  chemotherapy has no effect on pre-formed amyloid.32 Doxycycline has 
pleiotropic, de-fibrillogenic and inhibitory effects on amyloid fibrils shown to be 
beneficial in in vitro, in murine  models and other preclinical studies. We will 
prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of   doxycycline in AL amyloidosis 
patients.

 8.1.2 Pharmacodynamics 
Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and bound to plasma proteins in varying 
degree. They are concentrated by [CONTACT_255185], and excreted in the urine 
and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form. Doxycycline is 
virtually completely absorbed after oral administration. 
8.1.3 Pharmacokinetics  
Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration.  
Following a 200 mg dose, normal adult volunteers averaged peak serum levels of 2.6 mcg/ml of doxycycline at 2 hours, decreasing to 1.45 mcg/ml at 24 hours. 
Excretion of doxycycline by [CONTACT_255186] 40%/72 hours in individuals with 
normal renal function. This percentage excretion may fall as low as 1 -5%/72 
hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 ml/min). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half- life of 
doxycycline (range 18-22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impair ed 
renal function.

receive drug specifically for this study.  The CTO (at MCW)  will be billed for the cost of 
the drug which will be paid for by [CONTACT_90466].  The drug will be dispensed per patient (1 
month supply at a time for systemic amyloidosis; 3 month supply at a time for local 
amyloidosis ) and labeled according to more stringent state or federal law.  Drug 
accountability and inventory records will be created and maintained within the 
Investigational Drug Services.  
  
Version  Date  08-19-[ADDRESS_310165] to anti-amyloid treatment to improve organ response in patients with AL amyloidosis . 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the cumulative organ response at 1 year. The 
incidence of organ response to conventional chemotherapy at 1 year is approximately 20-25%. 
At the time of publication the results of the study will be retros pectively compared against AL 
amyloidosis patients undergoing chemotherapy alone at our institution in the last [ADDRESS_310166] single -stage phase II design . We will consider the 
“experimental” regimen of doxycycline with conventional anti-amyloid treatment to be no more effective than conventional anti-amyloid treatment alone, the true probability of organ response 
at 1 year is no less than 25% (p0). We will assume that the new experimental regimen is worthy of furth er study of the true probability of organ response greater than 50% (p1). In statistical 
terms, we are testing the null hypothesis H
0: p≤0.25, versus the alternate H 1: p≥0.5, where p is 
probability of organ response. Our power analysis indicated that we will need [ADDRESS_310167] 
80% power to detect the designed difference at 5% significance level. We will increase the 
sample size by 15% to 30 in order to account for patients with advanced disease who may die 
prior to response. Patients dying prior to response are a competing risk event. The probability of 
response will be calculated using the cumulative incidence curve to accommodate for competing 
risks. Six month and twelve month cumulative incidence rates of response with 95% confidence 
intervals will be reported. Point- wise test will be considered to compare response rates of study 
patients to response rates under standard treatment using historical controls from published literature.  
In the final analysis, if [ADDRESS_310168] the null 
hypothesis. 
We anticipate that a maximum of 30  patients will be accrued to the study. Descriptive statistics 
(i.e. means, standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals for continuous variables, and frequencies for discrete data) will be computed for all correlative laboratory parameters. Patients 
who receive <1 month of doxycycline therapy and withdraw from the study will be replaced.

 Safety/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  
1. Development of grade 3- 4 adverse events deemed to be related to doxycycline in 6 or 
more patients, will mandate halting further patient accrual until review by [CONTACT_32622] . 
 
Accrual Estimate:  26-30 patients. Patients experiencing mortality within 30 days of starting 
treatment  due to disease progression, will be replaced to fully assess 1 year amyloid organ 
response. However, all patients will be included in toxicity and survival analysis. 
 
Accrual Period :   Approximately 12-24 months 
  
Follow- Up Period :  One year to evaluate incidence of amyloid (hematologic and organ) 
response and relapse pattern.  Five years for survival outcomes, relapse, and mortality.  
10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
10.[ADDRESS_310169] medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not consider drug related. 
Life-threatening adverse event or life- threatening suspected adverse reaction:   An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 
Serious adverse event or serious suspected adverse reaction:  An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death,  
• A life -threatening prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Version  Date  08-19-16 
26 
 • Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_204216] y be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent of the outcomes listed above.   
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event  for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser deg ree of certainty about causality than 
adverse reaction, which means  any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction:  An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; 
or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, it is not consistent with the risk 
information currently described.   
Unexpected also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as 
occurrin g with the particular drug under investigation.

  Reporting of Adverse Events  
Because all of the study transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_255177], significant regimen related toxicity is expected.  A study specific toxicity CRF 
will be designed to capture information regarding these expected events.  Unexpected 
adverse events will be reported throughout the study. 
 
Unexpected Adv erse Events 
Unexpected Grades 3 -5 (severe, life threatening, disabling, or fatal) require expedited 
reporting and will be submitted to the DSMC within 5 calendar days  of discovery for 
review.  If the Grade 3 -5 event is determined to be an unanticipated problem, the event will 
be forwarded to the MCW/FH IRB for review as required by [CONTACT_255188].  Unexpected 
adverse events, regardless of severity, will be reported to the DSMC and reviewed on a 
quarterly basis.

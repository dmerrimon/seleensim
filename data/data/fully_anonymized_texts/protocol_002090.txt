 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Study Title Development of the Diabetes Homeless Support (D-Homes) Program – Part Two Funder NIH-NIDDK Clinical Phase N/A Study Rationale More than eight million Americans each year experience unstable housing and/or homelessness; this includes 44% of all adults seen at community health centers. The chronically homeless have a 5- to 10-fold increased risk of premature death and high health care costs (driven by [CONTACT_68923][INVESTIGATOR_6042]). Diabetes prevalence is approximately the same among the homeless versus general population (8%), but people with type [ADDRESS_154482] DH are of minority race and/or ethnicity. Poor glycemic control can induce “metabolic memory,” or long-term vascular stresses which persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_136020]. Managing diabetes while homeless presents a unique set of barriers including food insecurity, low social support, lack of safe medication storage/refrigeration. Almost half of people who are homeless have comorbid mental illness and/or substance use disorders. Prescription medications are a cornerstone in the management of type 2 diabetes and avoidance of complications. Diabetes medication adherence is low in housed populations, and limited evidence suggests it is as low or lower among DH; adherence is highly correlated with all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47144]. A tailored intervention to improve medication adherence in DH could have substantial public health impact through reduction of the disparities in morbidity and mortality faced by [INVESTIGATOR_34484]. The study goal is to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a collaborative care intervention tailored to DH using motivational interviewing and psychosocial support to improve medication adherence. Our team’s central hypothesis is that medication adherence (and eventual glycemic control, health care use/cost) will improve with an intervention tailored to the unique context of DH. Study Objective(s) Primary  • To develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a behavioral intervention tailored to DH using behavioral activation, motivational interviewing and psychosocial support to improve medication adherence Secondary • To improve diabetes control (HgA1c)  Test Article(s) Behavioral intervention to support medication adherence 
 Study Design Single arm treatment-development trial Subject Population Key Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: We will enroll adults (age > 18 yrs.) with type 2 diabetes who are experiencing homelessness. Inclusion criteria: 1. Age [ADDRESS_154483] 5. Plan to stay in local area or be reachable by [CONTACT_68925] 16 weeks 6. Willingness to work on medication adherence and diabetes self-care Exclusion criteria: 1. Inability to provide informed consent (e.g., presence of a legal guardian, prisoners) 2. Active psychosis or intoxication precluding ability to give informed consent 3. Pregnant or lactating females.  4.   Patients who choose to opt out of research. Number Of Subjects   Total Number of Subjects: 15 Total Number at Hennepin Healthcare: Unknown  Total Number of Sites: 1 (Health Care for the Homeless) Study Duration Each subject’s participation will last [ADDRESS_154484] one year. Study Phases Screening Intervention Follow-Up   (1) Screening: screening for eligibility and obtaining consent, baseline assessment  (2) Intervention: study intervention with counselor support approximately weekly in-person and/or by [CONTACT_648] x 12 weeks (3) Follow-up: final assessment Efficacy Evaluations • Self-reported medication adherence • Self-reported psychological wellness • Self-reported diabetes self-management, distress  • Hemoglobin A1c measured by [CONTACT_2929]-of-care fingerstick Safety Evaluations Not applicable in this single arm trial Statistical And Analytic Plan The primary endpoint of this study is the feasibility and acceptability of the program to participants in this treatment development phase. We will summarize themes in the end-of treatment interview, assess satisfaction via structured survey, and 
 assess treatment dose received via frequency, length, and type of communications with study staff. We will conduct exploratory analyses on our eventual primary behavioral endpoint of medication adherence and compare this with change in our eventual primary clinical endpoint of point-of-care Hemoglobin A1c during this same time frame. We will refine our use of patient-reported outcomes and administrative claims data for use in the future, planned randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. Data And Safety Monitoring Plan [CONTACT_68954] (PI) will work closely with study staff to monitor the quality of data collected at assessment. This treatment development study (N=15), does not meet NIH criteria requiring a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), however Drs. Vickery, Busch, and Connett will oversee a detailed safety monitoring plan.

   [ADDRESS_154485] a collaborative care intervention using motivational interviewing and behavioral activation alongside education and psychosocial support to improve medication adherence tailored to the experiences of people experiencing homelessness and diabetes (DH). Our team’s central hypothesis is that medication adherence and diabetes self-care (and eventual glycemic control, health care use/cost) will improve with an intervention tailored to the unique context of DH.   This work builds upon part 1 (HSR#19-4622) during which we completed Aim 1 activities to develop the initial Diabetes Homeless Medication Support (D-Homes) treatment manual through focus groups with DH at various levels of glycemic control and interviews with their multi-disciplinary providers. Data from this phase has identified barriers and strategies for medication adherence, patient values regarding medication, and treatment preferences and informed development of this part [ADDRESS_154486] cases (n=15). With a hypothesis that the D-Homes manual and study procedures will be feasible and acceptable to DH as measured by [CONTACT_6270]-report and post-treatment interview.  Eventually, part 2 will be followed by a fully randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_68894] 3, a fully randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. Approval of this activity from the IRB will be sought before these activities begin.  SIGNFICANCE Homeless people in the US face disproportionate risk for premature death in part due to poorly controlled chronic diseases including diabetes. One and a half million unique US adults access homeless shelters annually. However, the total number of people experiencing homelessness (Box) is likely much higher19 with an estimated 7 million additional people living “doubled up” with family/friends in 2014.20 New data recently established that 44% of all adults, and 37% of adults with diabetes, at US community health centers experience unstable housing.3,4 All-cause mortality rates among people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. are 4.5 to 9.6-times higher than the general population. Premature death often results from preventable chronic diseases including diabetes (2%) and its related comorbidities, e.g. heart disease (16%).21 While diabetes prevalence among the homeless and general population is comparable (≈8% in both),[ADDRESS_154487] over five times the odds of diabetes-related emergency or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186].4 This is of particular concern given “metabolic memory,” or long-term vascular stresses which persist after significant early hyperglycemia despi[INVESTIGATOR_136020].25 While homelessness and unstable housing are increasingly recognized for Box. Defining Homelessness:Many definitions of homelessness exist. We adopt that of the U.S. government which includes people who:•Lack “fixed, regular, adequate nighttime residence”•Stay at emergency shelters, temporary living facilities, other places not meant for human habitation•Will imminently lose their primary residence (HEARTH Act, 2011)
   [ADDRESS_154488] on diabetes control, including by [CONTACT_11026],26,27 there is a paucity of solution-driven research. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatments to improve glycemic control in DH as they move across the spectrum of unstable housing.   Medication adherence is a complex behavior critically linked to improved overall and diabetes-specific outcomes. The rate of adherence for all long-term therapi[INVESTIGATOR_68895] 50% in the general (non-homeless) U.S. population due to barriers at various levels including: (i) patient, (ii) medication/disease, (iii) system, and (iv) socioeconomic.28 Among privately insured populations, non-adherence to diabetes and related cardiovascular medications is associated with poor disease control (e.g., higher hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure), as well as increased risk of all-cause mortality and visits to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68896], and total health care costs.29,[ADDRESS_154489], every 10% improvement in diabetes medication adherence reduced hemoglobin A1c by 0.16%.33 The importance of medication adherence is recognized by [CONTACT_68927] (PA-18-722).34  Poor diabetes outcomes among the homeless is caused by [CONTACT_68928]. Non-adherence to medications across disease types is a known concern for homeless people especially when they are young (age <40 yrs.), have comorbid mental health/substance use disorders, experience food insecurity35 and frequent the emergency department. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_68897]-morbidities,36 36% of US homeless adults report unmet needs for prescription medications.37 Small studies find lower medication adherence in homeless patients when directly compared to housed peers.38 DH patients specifically report challenges obtaining, storing, and retaining medication (especially insulin), and stigma surrounding the possession/use of needles.39,40,41,42  Existing evidence-based models targeting medication adherence to improve diabetes will be the starting point for our novel intervention. We will draw from such interventions which target patient and system-level factors43 to improve diabetes self-care activities, including medication adherence, for historically disadvantaged groups. The overarching theoretical model guiding treatment development is the Information Motivation Behavioral Skills model.44 Our proposed treatment is also consistent with the Collaborative Care Model, a care management approach designed for individuals with multiple chronic conditions with known success improving diabetes outcomes in patients with depression.45,46 The Collaborative Care Model frequently uses Motivational Interviewing as the counseling approach, as we plan to in this study.47 Behavioral Activation (BA) is another counseling approach that complements motivational interviewing. Behavioral intervention is empi[INVESTIGATOR_68898] a population with high levels of underlying psychiatric disease (especially depression) and/or psychosocial stress.96-99 BA is easier to train than other empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-supported counseling treatments and can be delivered with fidelity by [CONTACT_68929]’s level practitioners.100-101 BA is appropriately complemented by [CONTACT_68930], a person-centered, evidence-based approach to behavior change focused on participants’ values and preferences and overcoming expected ambivalence to change.[ADDRESS_154490] diabetes care guidelines.26  And we will offer problem-solving to address psychosocial needs (including food and housing) modeled after clinic-based approaches for homeless veterans.53,54 These evidence-based interventions 
   3 offer a starting point for a new intervention which will be tailored to the unique context of DH through the iterative, multi-stakeholder process described below.  2.1 Name [CONTACT_68953]-HOmEless Medication Support (D-HOMES) program. This will be a 12-week in-person, video, and/or phone-based support program centered on providing diabetes education, motivational and goal-setting support, and resource and care coordination (Figure 2). Psychological approaches of behavioral activation and motivational interviewing will be used along with provision of educational materials and tools to support behavior change, see Section 3. for details.

Andrew Busch (“Development of an Integrated Depression and Behavioral Risk Factor Reduction Intervention for Secondary Prevention following Acute Coronary Syndrome,” 1R03HL136540), primary mentor on this study. This is also in line with current literature about behavioral interventions to support improved diabetes self-management via medication adherence and psychosocial wellness.[ADDRESS_154492] a collaborative care intervention using motivational interviewing and behavioral activation alongside education and psychosocial support to improve medication adherence tailored to the experiences of people experiencing homelessness and diabetes (DH). 3.1 Primary Objective (or Aim) The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a 10-session behavioral activation and motivational interviewing support program is feasible and acceptable to DH. The outcomes we will use to assess this treatment development phase of our work will be our ability to recruit and retain participants, the dose of treatment we can deliver (i.e., participant’s attendance and follow-up with scheduled sessions and treatment activities), and participants’ report of their satisfaction and overall experience during participation in a structured survey and qualitative interview.  3.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim) The secondary objectives will be to edit Aim 3 randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_136021]. We will: Clarify recruitment and retention strategies for DH  Assess the acceptability of patient-reported outcome measures and laboratory testing protocols  Finalize plans to use administrative claims and health care record data Determine adequate incentive amounts and adequate timing of distribution Refine protocols for distribution of phones and other tools to support intervention participation and behavior change  4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 4.1 General Schema of Study Design This is a single arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_68902] D-HOMES behavioral treatment, see Table 1 above. The intervention, see Figure 1 above, targets diabetes education, motivation and goal-setting support, as well as resource and care coordination for people experiencing type 2 diabetes and homelessness (DH). The goal of this treatment development phase of our work is to refine approaches and protocols for further study of our program. 
   5 4.1.1 Screening Phase and Baseline Assessment Recruitment protocols are summarized in section 9.5 below but will involve (1) invitation to aim [ADDRESS_154493] in future research, and (2) referral from Health Care for the Homeless, Hennepin Healthcare, or shelter staff, (3) snowball sampling using advertisements and referrals via community partners and previous participants, (4) community advertisement using flyers in places such as bus stops, libraries, and shelters, and if needed (5) invitation letters and follow-up calls to eligible patients at Hennepin Healthcare, (6) tabling events with study flyers and snacks at Hennepin Healthcare or Health Care for the Homeless facilities and in public community spaces such as libraries, shelters, and community organizations. Potential subjects will be screened by [CONTACT_68933]. See Appendix A. Congruent with other trials in this area,[ADDRESS_154494] one, support will be given to help the participant schedule a primary care or endocrinology appointment at Hennepin County Health Care for the Homeless, Hennepin Healthcare, or another clinic/health system per participant preference. 4.1.[ADDRESS_154495] (“diabetes wellness coach”), and they will have a 4 week period within which to complete any missed visits and their final assessment visit. This is a maximum of 16 weeks duration per participant.  4.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected Enrollment for the study will continue until [ADDRESS_154496] been recruited or when enough data has been gathered to inform future steps of treatment development. HHRI will serve as the only site for this study. Health Care for the Homeless will offer space in the community for study related activities to minimize burden on participants (See Appendix B for letter of support with addresses list). 
   [ADDRESS_154497] to safety and respectful engagement in research. A consent quiz will be used to ensure that no individuals unable to consent are recruited similar to protocols used in part 1 of this study (HSR#19-4622). See Appendix C. Furthermore, we will continue working closely with community providers in this area and a multi-stakeholder team to ensure we achieve cultural congruence with the ways we approach and engage this population in research as well as with the planned study protocols.  No patients who have chosen to opt out of research will be included in this study. 4.5 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 4.5.1   Inclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria: 1. Age [ADDRESS_154498] 5. Plan to stay in local area or be reachable by [CONTACT_68925] 16 weeks 6. Willingness to work on medication adherence and diabetes self-care  4.5.2   Exclusion Criteria 1. Inability to provide informed consent (e.g., presence of a legal guardian, prisoners) 2. Active psychosis or intoxication precluding ability to give informed consent 3. Pregnant or lactating females.  4. Patients who choose to opt out of research. Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled. Any violations of these criteria must be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and Procedures.  5 STUDY PROCEDURES 5.1 Qualifying Visit  5.1.1 Eligibility, screening visit As outlined in Table 1, before consent, interested participants will complete a phone screening. This will cover inclusion and exclusion criteria and briefly describe the intervention to ensure the participant is aware and willing to commit to study. 5.1.2  Baseline Assessment and run-in After the screening visit, after the participant’s signed consent at baseline assessment visit 1, the medical record will be accessed. Participants’ diabetes diagnosis, past [ADDRESS_154499], frequency of refills, primary care team, and pattern of clinic/emergency department/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68904] [ADDRESS_154500] review, we will proceed with baseline visit 2. This will be an in-person visit scheduled to correspond with study visit #1.   As outlined in Table [ADDRESS_154501]: • Informed Consent, HIPPA authorization • Review Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria • Demographics/Medical History • Release of information for health systems used in last 12 mo.  • Release of information for insurance claims data in the last 12 mo.  • Vital Signs: BP, HR • Height and Weight • Point of care Hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c) • Medication review, self-reported and later verified in EHR • Primary/diabetes care team review • Patient-reported outcome survey items: o Health-related Quality of Life (EQ-5)102 o Kessler K-6 measure of psychological distress103 o Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5)115 o Health-related Quality of Life Short Form (SF-12)116 o Diabetes Distress Scale (17-items)104 o Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID)113 o Illness Intrusiveness Scale112 o Treatment Burden questionnaire114 o Diabetes self-management questionnaire (DSMQ)105 o Adherence to Refills and Medications Scales-Diabetes (ARMS-D)111 o Self-reported medication adherence (Adherence Start with Knowledge, ASK-12)[ADDRESS_154502] two baseline visits based on participant and assessment surveyor feedback.  
   8  5.2 Study Intervention  This will be a 10 session, 12-week in-person, video, and/or phone-based support program with assessment for 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after treatment visits. The treatment will center on providing diabetes education, motivational and goal-setting support, and resource and care coordination (Figure 2). Modality of treatment delivery will be adapted based on logistics by [CONTACT_136023]-19 pandemic.  In-person assessment visits will be conducted within Health Care for the Homeless clinical spaces at sites convenient to participants (see Appendix B for letter of support including addresses of sites) or at HHRI/HHS.  All in-person assessment and treatment visits will follow current guidance from HHRI and Hennepin Healthcare about social distancing and use of personal protective equipment. In-person treatment visits will be arranged at private spaces convenient to the participant that may include the participants home (see Appendix D for safety protocol related to home visits).  Video visits will be conducted via a secure Zoom or Teams link (using HHRI, Hennepin Healthcare, and/or Hennepin County HIPPA secure technology). Health Care for the Homeless maintains private spaces within local shelters and drop-in centers. They also have secure tablets on rolling stands for telehealth use in shelter clinics and hotels. These will be used for assessment and treatment visits in cooperation with HCH staff. If needed, an HHRI supported tablet may be added to further facilitate video visits. This may take place in adjacent, private rooms at a shelter, hotel, or apartment facility (e.g. participant in their own room or in a clinic exam room and research staff in a private office or exam room) or may be conducted by [CONTACT_59274][INVESTIGATOR_58448] a tablet for participant use and collected later. See Appendix E for Study Issued Cell Phone/Tablet Agreement. Phone visits will be conducted via a study or office phone or using the secure TelemedIQ app of study team members. If phone minute compensation below is insufficient to support participant phone access or a participant mentions they have no working phone, a study phone will be issued to participants. Participants receiving a phone will sign a Study Issued Cell Phone/Tablet Agreement (See Appendix E). Psychological approaches of behavioral activation and motivational interviewing will be used along with provision of educational materials and tools to support behavior change. Tools/materials will be distributed with travel and cell phone minute renumerations as above. See Appendix F for a sample list of tools and educational materials that might be provided. Which tools and educational materials are given to which participants will be decided by [CONTACT_136024]. E.g.) A participant with 10 medications per day may benefit from a pi[INVESTIGATOR_68905]. E.g.) A participant with many appointments for behavioral and physical health care may benefit from a pocket calendar. Financial value of gifts ranges from $2.99 (hand sanitzer) to $32.95 (lock boxes).  In order to facilitate follow-up with this population, we will ask participants to provide multiple modalities by [CONTACT_136025], including phone, email, and social media. While study visits may occur by [CONTACT_648], email and social media communications will be limited to content only related to arranging details of when/where and how to connect with 
   [ADDRESS_154503] a higher than average likelihood of their phone service ending due to unpaid bills. If phone service is shut off, email and social media platforms continue to be used by [CONTACT_136026]’s wifi capabilities. Participants will provide their email addresses, usernames and preferred platforms and provide signed consent to be contact[CONTACT_136027]. Privacy concerns and appropriate use of email and social media to arrange for other communication with study team will be noted in the consent. We will also ask participants to identify two people who know them well and would know how to reach them in the event that we are not able to contact [CONTACT_136028], email, or social media. Similarly, we will ask participants to identify medical and social service providers who would know their current address or have up-to-date contact [CONTACT_136029]. Participants will be asked to sign appropriate releases of information to allow medical and social service providers to share this information with the study team. 5.2.[ADDRESS_154504] visit will immediately follow the baseline #[ADDRESS_154505] visit are to (a) establish rapport, (b) assess baseline diabetes self-care behaviors, (c) describe the rationale for the treatment. The interventionist will get to know the participant and discuss things of importance in their life. She will complete a detailed assessment of prescribed diabetes medications and use of pharmacies and health care clinics/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68906]. The interventionist will also: • Review boundaries for sessions, confidentiality, and mandated reporting • Educate the patient on the rationale of behavioral activation and motivational interviewing • Assess co-morbidities (e.g. mental illness, substance use disorder, heart disease) and contextual factors (e.g. housing status, social supports, food security) of influence • Assess existing diabetes care team; refer to HCH or Hennepin Healthcare if no team in place. • Assign self-monitoring goals per behavioral activation 5.2.2 Visit 2  The goals of the second visit are to complete a values assessment and provide relevant/needed health behavior tools. The interventionist will use a list to prompt the values assessment based on the Valued Living Questionnaire.96 She will: • Identify participant values • Provide health behavior tools as desired/needed (e.g., pi[INVESTIGATOR_16582], warm socks; see Appendix F for details) • Identify valued activities goals to promote diabetes medication adherence and psychosocial wellness specific to the participant’s values and context • Problem solve foreseeable barriers to behavior change goals 
   10 5.2.3 Visits 3-5  The goals of visits 3-5 will be to advance the practice of behavioral activation and motivational interviewing to promote improved diabetes knowledge/confidence, and reduced logistical and emotional barriers specifically related to medication and other diabetes adherence. During these visits the interventionist will: • Review engagement in health and wellness-promoting valued activities • Identify valued activities goals to promote diabetes medication adherence and psychosocial wellness specific to the participant’s values and context • Problem solve foreseeable barriers to emergent behavior change  • Assess for inclusion of diet, exercise goals to enhance diabetes adherence goals 5.2.[ADDRESS_154506] will:  • Introduce advanced or challenging valued activity goals • Explore ways to increase synergy between psychosocial wellness and diabetes health behavior goals 5.2.[ADDRESS_154507] will: • Plan and implement strategies for long-term maintenance of diabetes adherence goals 5.2.[ADDRESS_154508]. The staff person will assess: • Vital Signs: BP, HR • Height and Weight • Hemoglobin A1c • Medication review • Self-report survey measures • Satisfaction with intervention 5.3 Part 2 of the Study Details of Part 2 of the study (Aim 3 randomized trial protocols) will be submitted in a future amendment. 5.[ADDRESS_154509] will work with the patient to set treatment goals related to improved diabetes care. These may include between-visit text messages, calls, e-mails, or private messages on 
   11 secure social media platforms per the participant’s preference. These will be done with input and agreement by [CONTACT_2299]. The interventionist will also respond to participant-initiated between visit communications. Should communications become too frequent or surpass agreed upon treatment boundaries, the interventionist will be guided to set boundaries and limit contact [CONTACT_68937]. Vickery and/or Busch.  5.5 Concomitant Treatment All prior and concomitant diabetes care in the year prior to the screening visit and through the end of the study will be recorded with patient input as well as review of medical records (with signed consent). Care for relevant co-morbidities (mental illness, substance use disorder, cardiac disease, etc.) will also be recorded.  5.[ADDRESS_154510] Completion/Withdrawal Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator for lack of adherence to study treatment or visit schedules and AEs. If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events after the subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source documents and on the case report form. 5.7.[ADDRESS_154511] no further study visits.  6 STUDY EVALUATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS 6.1 Screening and Monitoring Evaluations and Measurements Our pre-consent phone screening will closely parallel the phone screening we completed for focus group participants in our Aim 1 study (HSR#19-4622). This was efficient and well-tolerated by [CONTACT_10132] a variety of housing circumstances in that study. The primary goal will be to ensure eligibility and interest in study participation. We will also ensure participant will be reachable for the 16 week study time frame. We will assess diabetes history, housing history, medication use, communication preferences/access, and also collect basic demographic data, (e.g. age, gender). See Appendix A for script and question structure. During the baseline and final assessment visits data will be collected using the following procedures: Demographics/Medical History Participants will be given a written survey at either the Baseline 1 or Baseline 2 visit to add to data collected in pre-consent screening. If patients prefer, these questions will be asked verbally by [CONTACT_33709].  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_22871]: health insurance, education, medical history, and current living situation. This will also include the Brief Trauma Questionnaire.[ADDRESS_154512]/abstraction Signed release of information forms will be collected for participants at their primary care clinic/preferred health system and at Hennepin Healthcare and Hennepin County 
   12 affiliate clinics (including Health Care for the Homeless). Once signed consent is obtained, EPIC records at Hennepin Healthcare will be directly accessed for abstraction with signed consent.  Release of information (ROI) forms will be collected for outside health systems patients have used. ROI forms will be sent, via secure e-mail or fax, to Health Information Management offices at outside health systems. Return of information will occur via secure file transfer system preferred by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_68909].   Returned records will be abstracted by [CONTACT_464].  After the Baseline [ADDRESS_154513] 12 mo. of: • Medication list, dose, frequency, and prescriber • Comorbidities (including physical and behavioral health) • History of medication refill frequency • Number of visits to primary care: Overall and related to diabetes  • Number of visits and length of stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Overall and related to diabetes  • Number of visits to the emergency department: Overall and related to diabetes  • Number of visits to behavioral health providers, as relevant • History of hemoglobin A1c: Data and results of tests • History of blood pressure, height, and weight  After the 12-week visit, we will review and abstract any changes in:  • Medication list, dose, frequency, and prescriber • History of medication refill frequency • Number of visits to primary care: Overall and related to diabetes  • Number of visits and length of stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Overall and related to diabetes  • Number of visits to the emergency department: Overall and related to diabetes  • Number of visits to behavioral health providers, as relevant • History of hemoglobin A1c: Data and results of tests 
   [ADDRESS_154514] records to be from Minnesota Medical Assistance. We will work directly with Minnesota Department of Human Services Medicaid office to securely obtain records at the end of the study on all participants. Signed consents will be sent via secure fax or secure file transfer process.   Pharmacy and health care claims data detailing medication refill patterns as well as clinic, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and emergency department use across all health systems will be abstracted. We will follow pre-established protocols to examine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68910].109  Biometric data The following biometric data will be collected from participants. See Appendix G for detailed information on how these will be measured: • Blood pressure • Heart rate • Height • Weight • Hemoglobin A1c--Participants will receive a copy of their results. See Appendix H for A1c results sheet.  Medication review Patients will be asked to bring all their medications to the Baseline [ADDRESS_154515]. Self-report survey measures Formal assessment surveys will be collected at Baseline Assessment 1 and/or Baseline Assessment 2 and 12-week assessment visits used as follows: 1. Health-related Quality of Life (EQ-5)102 2. Kessler K-6 measure of psychological distress103 3. Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5)115 4. Health-related Quality of Life Short Form (SF-12)116 5. Diabetes Distress Scale (17-items)104 6. Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID)113 7. Illness Intrusiveness Scale112 8. Treatment Burden questionnaire114

Self-reported medication adherence (Adherence Start with Knowledge, ASK-12)106 12. Basic needs survey107 13. Current and lifetime housing status 14. Use of substances 15. Brief Trauma Questionnaire108 16. Self-reported health care use Satisfaction with intervention At the final assessment visit, the assessor (who is not the interventionist) will collect input about the participant’s experiences during the intervention.   Participant satisfaction will be assessed by [CONTACT_68939], an 8-item measure developed in the mental health field,[ADDRESS_154516] safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_68926]. We will also follow safety protocols in case we identify dangerous blood pressure, or heart rate values at baseline or final assessment visits. See Section 8 for details. 7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 7.1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint of this study is the feasibility and acceptability of the program to participants in this treatment development phase. We will assess this by [CONTACT_68940], the dose of treatment we can deliver (i.e., participant’s attendance and follow-up with scheduled sessions and treatment activities), and participants’ report of their satisfaction and overall experience during participation in a structured survey (CSQ-8) and qualitative interview. In addition to above outcomes, we will 
   15 carefully track the number and types of between-treatment communications with participants (who initiated communication; form of communication: text, calls, e-mails, etc.). We will conduct exploratory analyses to define our eventual primary behavioral endpoint of medication adherence e.g.) Change from baseline to 12-weeks in the ASK-12 questionnaire or Change from baseline to 12-weeks in ARMS-D questionnaire to help inform the next phase of the study. We will compare this with change in our eventual primary clinical endpoint of point-of-care Hemoglobin A1c during this same time frame. 7.2 Secondary Endpoints Secondary endpoints will include the following changes from baseline to 12-week visit: Overall change in patient-reported outcome measures: E.g.) Change in overall DSMQ score and changes in sub-scales E.g.) Change in Diabetes Distress score, E.g.) Change in health-related quality of life and psychological distress Change in medication refill pattern from the electronic health record abstraction and insurance claims Change in blood pressure, BMI Safety and tolerability of the treatment based on Adverse Events and participant withdrawal Exploratory analyses will examine the impact of different algorithms on claims data variable specification to define medication adherence, health care use (clinic, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and emergency department), as well as to categorize when use related to diabetes overall and specifically to hypo- and hyperglycemic events necessitating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  7.[ADDRESS_154517] descriptive summaries (e.g. means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and percentages for categorical variables such as gender). 7.3.2 Efficacy Analysis The primary purpose of this study is feasibility and acceptability. This will be assessed using the following data: Qualitative data Analysis of audio recordings of end-of-treatment interviews will be completed by [CONTACT_136030], treatment experience, and suggested changes of intervention participants.  Survey data from the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Exploratory analyses by [CONTACT_545], gender, and housing circumstances will be done to look for any patterns. Communication and treatment contact [CONTACT_136031] (by [CONTACT_136032]), total minutes of completed treatment, and any notes from treatment sessions.   Clinical outcome analyses will focus on exploratory analyses to determine any evidence as to whether D-HOMES had clinically meaningful effects. We will assess planned future 
   16 primary behavioral and clinical outcomes of medication adherence (ASK-12) and point of care Hemoglobin A1c as detailed above. We will use t-tests to assess changes in these continuous variables in exploratory post-treatment analyses.  We will additionally use chi-squared tests (for categorical variables) and t-tests (for continuous variables) to examine within participant effect sizes and response rates (using standard cut offs) on the secondary end points listed above. We will analyze data in an intent-to-treat manner. Exploratory analysis of electronic medical record and administrative claims data will examine the impact of various algorithms for constructing pharmacy-record adherence measures and health care use variables. We will use these analyses to define protocols for use in our Aim [ADDRESS_154518]. Busch (HSR#17-4351) as well as the current literature.110 8 STUDY MEDICATION (Not applicable) 8  SAFETY MANAGEMENT 8.1  Clinical Adverse Events Clinical adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be closely monitored throughout the study in accordance with HHRI IRB definitions and policies.  8.2  Adverse Event Reporting Unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others that occur during the course of this study and SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Attachment EEE: Prompt Reporting Guidelines. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  [CONTACT_68954] will be responsible for completing Adverse Events Forms should an event occur. She will report Serious Adverse Events to the HHRI IRB within 24 hours of having received notice of the event.   Drs. Vickery, Busch, and Connett will collaboratively gather any information needed to investigate the event and determine subsequent action. Any subsequent action will be documented and reported to the HHRI IRB and the Program Officer at NIH.   Adverse event reports will be reviewed annually with the HHRI IRB to ensure participant safety.  8.3  Investigator Reporting of a Serious Adverse Event to Sponsor Reporting to the National Institutes of Health will be completed as required by [CONTACT_68941]. 8.4  Medical Emergencies 
   17 If non-urgent psychological distress arises in participants during study related activities, study staff will provide a handout about local mental health resources, including a 24-hour support line and psychiatric emergency room (Appendix P). If non-urgent physical health needs arise in participants, study staff will provide written resources about health care available through Health Care for the Homeless and Hennepin Healthcare (Appendix P). If an emergency physical or behavioral health situation arises, study staff will arrange for immediate clinical support from PI ([CONTACT_68954]), Health Care for the Homeless clinical staff (who have a walk-in treatment model), the Hennepin County mental health crisis team (COPE Line, available by [CONTACT_14379]-person 24hrs./day, 7 days/week), or emergency medical services as appropriate. This event will be written up and reviewed by [CONTACT_978] ([CONTACT_68954]) and primary mentor ([CONTACT_68956]) within 48 hours of the event and reported to the IRB if needed. If measured blood pressure surpasses SBP>180 or DBP>100 or pulse>[ADDRESS_154519] within a study visit and falls <60 or >400/error, study staff will page [CONTACT_68954] who will provide clinical assessment of symptoms and make referral or arrangement for immediate transfer to appropriate treatment as needed. As deemed necessary by [CONTACT_68942]/or HHRI IRB, issues related to patient safety will be reviewed with mental health or medical professionals at HCMC not affiliated with the study who will provide recommendations for withdrawal from the study, referrals for additional care, or other necessary action.  [ADDRESS_154520] ID numbers and will contain no personal identifiers. Once audio recordings are uploaded to the HHRI-maintained 
   18 computer network, they will be deleted from the audio recording equipment. Audio recordings will be destroyed on or before the end of the grant period, 12/31/2023.  Since assessment visits will be conducted at locations away from the research offices of the PI, extreme care will be taken to keep study materials in the possession of research staff at all times. Immediately after visits, consent forms, hemoglobin A1c results, audio equipment, and other study materials will be returned to the secure research offices of Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute. Each office has a locked door in a badge-access-only wing of the Institute. Signed consent documents will further be stored in a locked file drawer whose key will be stored in a separate locked key box. Study data, including all audio recordings will be stored and analyzed on [CONTACT_68954] and her staff’s HHRI-maintained computer network. This network is robust, secure, and has state-of-the-art back-up and password protections. [CONTACT_68954] and staff will comply with any necessary software, hardware, and data storage updates to maintain the security of this system under the direction of the HHRI IT Department. The identifiers will be destroyed on or before the completion date of the grant, 12/31/2023.  The other data will be retained for three years.   9.[ADDRESS_154521] of research (i.e., both HIPAA and CITI trainings). Identifying information will not be reported in any publication.   No identifiable data will be used for future study without first obtaining IRB approval. The investigator will obtain a data use agreement between the provider (the PI) of the data and any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at Hennepin Healthcare) before sharing a limited dataset (PHI limited to dates and zip codes).  9.4  Regulatory and Ethical Considerations 9.4.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan This treatment development study (N=15), does not meet NIH criteria requiring a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as we expect it to be considered minimal risk by [CONTACT_68943].   However, we have a detailed data safety and monitoring plan. [CONTACT_68954] will have primary responsibility for monitoring all procedures for data collection, analysis, and storage. Any adverse events, breaches of confidentiality, or other data or safety issues that arise will be discussed during weekly visits with [CONTACT_68956] (primary mentor) or sooner if required and immediately brought to the attention of [CONTACT_68957] (biostats. co-mentor). [CONTACT_68957] has served on numerous DSMBs for large NIH trials. If needed, Drs. Busch and Connett will locate representatives independent of the study team for input. 
   19  All issues related to patient safety (e.g., psychiatric distress) will be reviewed with medical and mental health professionals at Hennepin Healthcare not affiliated with the study who will provide recommendations for withdrawal from the study, referrals for additional care, or other necessary action. If requested by [CONTACT_68944], a DSMB will be convened. 9.4.2  Risk Assessment Discomfort or distress when completing assessment and treatment procedures. Some participants may feel uncomfortable or distressed answering personal or private questions during assessment or treatment. Some participants may also feel uncomfortable or distressed due to the collection of physical measures (e.g., weight). In previous studies by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Busch, when individuals did report discomfort in these situations, it was mild.  We minimize discomfort or distress with three key approaches: (1) clearly explaining the study and emphasizing the optional nature of participation, (2) conducting all treatment sessions and assessment visits in private settings, (3) staff training about the sensitivity of chronic health conditions and the specific circumstances of homelessness including how to offer appropriate support. Confidentiality or loss of privacy. We will collect potentially sensitive information about participants; if released inappropriately, participants may experience embarrassment or distress. The seriousness of the consequences would depend on the nature of the information revealed and to whom the information was revealed. See Section 9.[ADDRESS_154522] this would be exacerbated from trial participation, it is possible that a minority of participants will experience worsening of mental illness, depression, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_68914]. See Section 8.4 above for our detailed safety plan to address this risk. 9.4.3  Potential Benefits of Trial Participation Potential benefits for participants include free diabetes management treatment with a goal of improved diabetes self-management which can reduce their morbidity from this disease. Free counseling related to psychosocial wellness may improve participants’ quality of life. Furthermore, there may be indirect benefits for participants in knowing they have helped promote research to develop an intervention that could help other people at later times.  9.4.[ADDRESS_154523] the potential benefits to participants to outweigh the low risks of study participation. 9.5  Recruitment Strategy Recruitment of participants will begin with subjects from part 1 (HSR#19-4622). In that study [ADDRESS_154524] been 
   20 relocated during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will provide flyers to these staff to share with eligible patients and/or to post in appropriate areas of their facilities. The flyer will include an email and phone number to invite interested patients to contact [CONTACT_16133] (Appendix J, Appendix P).   As a third approach, we will use snowball sampling. We will ask community partners and previous participants to distribute our study flyer to or refer friends/acquaintances who might be interested. As a fourth approach, we will post our recruitment flyer in locations frequented by [CONTACT_68946] (e.g., bus stops, shelter bulletin boards, libraries).  As a fifth approach, we will include use the electronic health record system at Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC). We will ask staff in the HCMC Analytics Center for Excellence to use the existing homeless indicator,[ADDRESS_154525] eligible patients by [CONTACT_68945] a follow-up phone call—a method we’ve used successfully in the past to recruit unstably housed individuals (Appendix K, Appendix L). Care will be taken to ensure letters emphasize the voluntary nature of participation and to emphasize that the choice to participate will not impact receipt of health care at HCMC or other health systems they may visit. If needed, as a sixth approach we will use convenience sampling at healthcare and community sites. Study staff will go to sites with informational materials (ADA and CDC flyers and pamphlets), study flyers and low-glycemic snacks in order to engage with community members about the study face-to-face, and may schedule baseline assessments with interested persons (Appendix P). Information sessions will include both one-on-one conversations and tabling sessions that take place at a variety of healthcare and community settings with permission from each site’s leadership, including Hennepin Healthcare facilities, Healthcare for the Homeless clinics, libraries, shelters, and community or social service agencies.  9.6  Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization We will collect signed consent and HIPAA authorization from all participants (Appendix M, Appendix N). The consent will also include HIPAA authorization to review their electronic health record at Hennepin Healthcare and any other systems where they have gotten care in the last year. We will also ask them to sign consent for us to obtain claims data for one year before and one year after study participation from their insurance provider. Staff will review consent documents with participants and monitor their comprehension using teach back methods. After presentation of key features of the document, research staff will administer a 4-question consent quiz to confirm comprehension from all patient participants (Appendix C). This will be a written quiz but administered orally to participants who request it. Participants must answer all questions on the consent quiz correctly to consent. Research staff may administer the quiz up to [ADDRESS_154526] answers prior to the second administration. Any and all questions will be answered by [CONTACT_68947].  
   21 Participants will be given up to thirty minutes to make the decision to participate and more time if requested. Those requesting more may be invited to reschedule their baseline enrollment visit. The consent form is written at the twelve-grade reading level or below. We will be getting feedback on the consent form and plan to submit a modification at a reduced reading level at a later date. If any participant appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol or unstable from a mental health perspective, or otherwise unable to consent, or if they fail the consent quiz, we will politely exclude them from participating.  If COVID-19 or other logistics necessitate, baseline visits 1 and 2 and treatment visit 1 will be conducted by [CONTACT_68948] (HHRI Zoom and/or HHRI/HCMC or Hennepin County Teams). See Appendix O for our e-consent protocol. 9.7  Payment to Subjects/Families Participants will be paid for their participation in three ways: (1) Reimbursement for travel, parking, and cell phone minutes/text messages for all assessment and treatment visits (2) Payment for time, effort, and inconvenience of assessment visits (3) Gifts in the form of tools and incentives to enhance behavior change goals 9.7.1  Reimbursement for travel, parking, and cell phone minutes/text messages Reimbursement for travel/parking for in-person visits and phone minutes/text messages for virtual or phone visits be reimbursed at $10 cash per visit. This will be given to participants who decline a cab ride to any in-person visits. We will provide a $20 bonus payment for participants who complete all 10 scheduled treatment sessions. Maximum travel and data/minutes reimbursement is summarized below:     Baseline visit 1 Baseline visit 2  Tx visit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Final visit Total $10 $10 $10 $10 $10 $10 $10 $10 $10 $10 $10 $10 $20 $140 Note: If Baseline 2 + Treatment visit 1 happen concurrently, total will be $130. Payment for treatment sessions will occur at each in-person visit. Phone visits will be reimbursed at the next in-person treatment or assessment visit or mailed or pi[INVESTIGATOR_136022] a homeless drop-in center per participant preference. Further, participants who receive a study phone to facilitate their participation will receive $[ADDRESS_154527] for time, effort, and inconvenience (i.e. compensation) Participants will be additionally reimbursed for study assessment visits at baseline and 12-weeks for their effort and inconvenience. This includes a finger-stick blood draw at each visit. We will compensate participants $30 for the baseline visits ($10 at visit 1 and $20 at visit 2) and $45 for the final assessment visit. Compensation will be in the form of cash. Maximum total compensation will be $75. The amount and form of these payments were set with input and approval by [CONTACT_29472]-stakeholder research team of people with lived experience and multi-disciplinary providers.

1.0. Introduction  
1.1 Background and  Rationale  
In the absence of treatment, Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) may progress to critical limb ischemia 
(CLI), which is characterized by [CONTACT_689746], and extens ive tiss ue loss that restricts 
revascularization options and frequently leads to amputation. CLI is estimated to have an incidence 
of approximately 50 to 100 per 100,000 per year and is associated with mortality rates as high as 20% 
at [ADDRESS_935653] been aggressively trying to treat CLI by [CONTACT_689747] (CTO’s) or by[CONTACT_689748] -intimal space using such products as 
the Medtronic Pi[INVESTIGATOR_689728] a wire into the sub-i ntimal space at the CTO and then 
attempts to re- enter the vessel after the occlusion. Once a wire is in place, one can place a stent to 
provide a by[CONTACT_689749]. More conventional approaches to treating PAD are 
also used in CLI  treatme nt once (if) a wire gets across the occlusion. These conventional methods 
include PTA, Stenting and more recently drug eluting balloons and stents.  
 
From the amputee -coalition.org website, the following are some statistics regarding the CLI problem : 
 
• There are nearly 2 million people living with limb loss in the United  States  
• The main causes of limb loss are dysvascular disease – including diabetes (54%), trauma 
(45%), and cancer (less than  2%).  
• Approximately 185,000 amputations occur in the [LOCATION_002] each  year.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689729] a limb amputated totaled more than $6.5 billion in 
2007  
• Survival rates after an amputation vary based on a variety of factors. Those who have amputations due to vascular disease (including peripheral arterial disease and diabetes) face 
a 30 -day mortality rate reported to be between 9 - 15% and a long-term survival rate of 60% 
at 1 year, 42% at 3 years, and 35- 45% at 5  years.  
• Nearly half of the people who lose a limb to dysvascular disease will die within [ADDRESS_935654] a lower -limb amputation, up to 55% will require amputation of 
the second leg within [ADDRESS_935655] clinical surgical cases were  
reported in the early 1900’s. Numerous small series of clinical trials have been published over the 
year using a surgical approach and a recent meta- analysis article summarized this work. The 2006

“Meta -analysis of the clinic al effec tiveness of venous arterialization for salvage of critically 
ischemic limbs.”  
Had the following results and conclusions:  
 
Results:  A total of 56 studies were selected for comprehensive review. No  
RCTs were identified. Seven patient series, comprising 228 p atients, matched the 
selection criteria. Overall 1 -year foot preservation was 71% (95% CI: 64 -77%) and 
1-year secondary patency was 46% (95% CI: 39 -53%). The large majority of 
patients in whom major amputation was avoided experienced successful wou nd 
healing, disappearance of rest pain and absence of serious complications.  
 
Conclusions: On the basis of limited evidence, venous arterialization may be 
considered as a viable alternative before major amputation is undertaken in 
patients with 'inoperable ' chroni c critical leg ischemia.

Venous (AV) fistula in the Below The Knee (BTK) vascular system using an endovascular, minimally invasive approach. 
1.2 Summary of Findings from Previous  Studies  
1.2.1.  Pre- clinical  studies: 
Extensive in vitro bench, in vivo animal, and cadaver studies have been successfully performed with 
the LimFlow System and verification testing for the catheter has been completed. Testing on the  
device included comprehensive design verification and validation testing. The following testing was 
completed on the LimFlow devices:  
• Biocompatibility  testing  
• Mechanical testing  
• Packaging  testing  
• Shelf -life testing  
• Sterilization  validation  
• Preclinical animal  stud ies 
These tests were successfully completed and are described in more detail in the Investigator Brochure.  
1.2.2.  Clinical studies:  
A non- randomized prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_50382] a CE Mark study have been conducted with the 
LimFlow System, see Report of Pri or Inves tigations in the Investigator Brochure for details on the 
study and patient outcomes. These studies supported the CE Mark approval of the device on 
October 17, 2016. The subjects continue to be followed through [ADDRESS_935656] -procedure, and the 
resul ts conti nue to be encouraging.

• Requirement for major amputation of index  limb  
 
1.3.2.  Benefits  
The benefit to the subjects enrolled in this study is the potential for improved blood flow to  the foo t 
reducing, but not necessarily eliminating the need for major amputation. The potential benefit of 
improved wound healing greatly outweighs  the standard endovascular/surgical risks associated with 
this procedure in this “no -hope” patient population who wi ll have a major amputation if the LimFlow 
procedure is not attempted.  
 
Specifically, risks to the patient are minimized due to:  
 
- The use of standard medical grade materials that have been thoroughly characterized and tested 
to assure  biocompatibili ty 
- Exten sive pre -clinical evaluation including in vitro bench testing, animal and cadaver study  
- The well established, standard nature of the endovascular procedures and techniques to be  used  
- The ability to quickly and safely remove the LimFlow System from the proc edure; the physician 
may elect to discontinue the use of the device at any time in favor of alternate  devices.  
- Frequent follow -up visits are conducted in the first year post -operatively to allow for systematic 
monitoring and surveillance of the ind ex limb,  allowing for early detection of hemodynamically 
significant stenoses in the graft that may occur in the absence of obvious  symptoms.  
- Potential subjects will be screened by [CONTACT_689752] i nclusion /exclusion  criteria.  
- Investigators will receive device training and will be proctored for their first case, and then for as 
many cases as they deem necessary to perform the procedure proficiently.

9.0 Data Management and Monitoring  
9.1. Study Data  Collection  
Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) will be used to capture data for the safety and performance analysis. Sites will be required to maintain source documentation, in accordance with GCP guidelines and 21 CFR 812 to substantiate all data collected.  
9.2. Site Data Monitoring and Quality  Control  
Primary data collection based on source -documented hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689736], which may include sponsor or sponsor’s designees. CRFs will be completed 
and forwarded to the sponsor within 14 days of the procedure or scheduled visit. The sponsor will 
provide adequate source document worksheets for capture of study -specific data during the 
procedure and follow -up visits that may not nor mally be collected during routine  procedures.  
The clinical site will be monitored periodically by [CONTACT_456]’s personnel, or sponsor’s designee, for protocol adherence, accuracy of CRFs, and compliance to applicable regulations. Any observations of 
non-compliance will be reviewed with the principal investigator. Any evident pattern of ongoing non - 
compliance may result in corrective actions by [CONTACT_456], including potential study suspension, as 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_456].

The sponsor will review  significant new information, including unanticipated serious adverse events 
and ensure that such information is provided to the appropriate regulatory agencies, the 
investigators and to all reviewing IRBs as required by [CONTACT_5279].  
 
 
10.0 Safe ty Oversight  
10.1. Safety: Complication Analysis and  Acceptance  
Revascularization catheter procedures are known to have inherent risks of complications. No new or 
additional complications or adverse events are expected due to the LimFlow portion of the 
procedure . 
10.1.[ADDRESS_935672] -Procedural  Complications  
If serious complications or adverse events related to the procedure or device are observed during and through the 6 month fo llow -up, the events will be individually analyzed for root cause relative to 
the complete treatment procedure and then evaluated by [CONTACT_689762]. The sponsor will assess these events for expedited reporting requirements.  
 
10.2. Independent Safety Committee  (ISC)  
 
An Independent Safety Committee will act as the medical monitor for this early Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]. The ISC will consist of at least two (2) physicians with experience in surgical and/or endovascular treatment of CL I patients, who are independent from the Sponsor and are not investigators in the study. 
Whenever possible, the ISC will review data in a blinded fashion (i.e., blinded to site and subject ID, 
follow -up period, etc.) to minimize any potential bias. Specific roles, responsibilities and processes 
will be described in a Safety Charter, which will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_689763].  
 
Screening Responsibilities:  
 
The ISC will review potential study candidates to evaluate their eligibility for the study, specifically to 
determine that no conventional distal by[CONTACT_689764] a suitable distal target artery. Specific criteria to be evaluated by [CONTACT_689765], but may not be limited to:  
• Baseline angiograms/images to evaluate the status and patency of the distal arterial bed (i.e., tibial and peritoneal arteries, dorsalis pedis artery, and plantar arteries)  
• Wound  photographs  
• Medi cal history, including Rutherford  Classification  
• Clinical evidence of severe hemodynamic compromise in the index limb (e.g., TcPO2, pulse assessments)

Endpoint Assessment/Adjudication: 
 
Technical Success: The ISC will review the procedural angiograms to assess stent graft/limb 
patency post -procedure to determine Technical Success.  
Outcomes Adjudication: Reports of endpoint events will be reviewed and adjudicated, 
including but not limited to:  
• Major amputation of the index  limb  
• Stent graft occlusion and/or acute stent thrombosis (via DUS and/or angiographic 
documentation)  
• Death  
• Major and minor re -interventions of the index  limb  
• Contrast -induced  nephropathy  
• Wound healing (progression, completion,  confirmation). 
 
 
Ongoing Safety Overview:  
 
The ISC will also review safety data while the study is in progress, including reports of any serious device - or procedure -related adverse events and/or any reports of device malfunction or failure. 
During the study, the ISC will be asked to ensure that the rights and welfar e of the subjects are 
protected by [CONTACT_689766], modification, or termination of the study based on review of safety data.  
 
10.3 Study Termination  
 
If LimFlow and/or the ISC and/or principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_530700] t hat an event, or event rate 
presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, then the investigation or parts of the investigation presenting that risk shall be immediately revised or terminated. Termination shall occur not later 
than [ADDRESS_935673] study 
procedure. Therefore, an underlying disease that was present at the time of enrollment is not reported as an AE, but any increase in the severity of the underlying disease is to be reported as an 
AE.

treatment.  
 
Severe:  Symptom(s) causing severe  discomfort and significant  impact of  the subject’s 
usual activity and requires  treatment.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event which leads to:  
 
• Death due to any  cause  
• Life-threatening  condition  
• Results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266]  
• Necessitates an intervention to prevent a permanent impairment of a body function or 
permanent damage to a body  structure  
• Results in congenital abnormality 
All SAE’s will be  reported.  
Device- Related Adve rse Event : an adverse event is considered to be device -related when, in the 
judgment of the investigator, the clinical event has a reasonable time sequence associated with use of 
the investigational device and is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent dis ease or other procedures or 
medications. It is reasonable to believe that the device directly caused or contributed to the adverse event.  
Procedure -Related Adverse Event : an adverse event is considered to be procedure -related when, in 
the judgment of the i nvestigator; it is reasonable to believe that the event is associated with the 
assigned study procedure and is not specific to the investigational device used. Other products, surgical techniques, or medications required specifically for the procedure are likely to have contributed to the occurrence of the event.  
Concomitant Medication -Related Adverse Event: an adverse event is considered to be concomitant 
medication related when, in the judgment of the investigator, it is reasonable to believe that the event is associated with concomitant medications used in conjunction with the investigational device and is 
not otherwise specific to the investigational device (e.g. bleeding associated with anticoagulation 
medication).  
Pre-Existing Condition -Related Adverse Event: an adverse event is considered to be related to a pre - 
existing condition when, in the judgment of the investigator, it is reasonable to believe that the event is 
associated with the subject’s pre -existing condition and is not specific to the inves tigational device or 
procedure. Pre -existing conditions that are aggravated or become more severe during or after the 
procedure should be evaluated on a case -by-case basis to determine if the event may be more 
appropriately classified as device -related or procedure -related.

Page [ADDRESS_935674] (UADE): Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with the study device, if that effect, 
problem or death was not previously ide ntified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
Investigational Plan or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
LimFlow, or its designee, in cooperation with the investigator, will assess all adverse events considered to be serious and device -related for potential reportability to the FDA and other regulatory authorities 
as an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE).  
 
The investigator should follow all unreso lved serious adverse events until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, the subject has withdrawn consent, or the adverse event is otherwise 
explained.  
For purposes of this study, the following events are not considered adverse events,  because they are 
normally expected to occur in conjunction with endovascular procedures / post -procedure, or are 
associated with customary, standard care of subjects undergoing these procedures:  
• Early post -operative pain (within [ADDRESS_935675] -index proced ure) at the access site  
and/or related to position on procedure  table  
• Post -anesthesia/conscious sedation emesis, nausea, or headache (within [ADDRESS_935676] - 
index  procedure)  
• Chest pain without associated ECG  changes  
• Hematocrit decrease from baseline not as sociated with hemodynamic changes, 
remaining above 30% and not requiring transfusion  
• Electrolyte imbalance without clinical sequelae following endovascular procedure, even if 
requiring  correction  
• Low grade temperature increase  (≤38.3° C/≤101°F) 
• Sinus bradyc ardia/tachycardia that does not require treatment or intervention  
• Systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes that do not require treatment or intervention  
This listing of events is intended to provide guidance to the investigational sites for purposes of  adverse 
event reporting. The investigator at the investigational site should utilize his/her own clinical judgment in 
evaluating adverse experiences, and may decide that the above events should be reported as adverse 
events.  
 
11.2. Reporting of Serious and Non -Serious Adverse Events  
 
11.2.1.  General Reporting Requirements (Serious & Non- Serious Adverse  Events)  
All potentially device - and/or procedure -related adverse events (AE) and all serious adverse events 
(SAE) will be reported and monitored from the time of treatmen t through the 6 month follow -up  
visit. Any SAEs related to the index limb will be reported and monitored throughout the 2 year 
follow -up visit. The report  should include:  severity, duration, action taken, treatment  outcome  and

11.3.  Device Failures and  Malfunctions  
Device  performance will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1963]. All performance data will be 
captured on the electronic case report forms.  
Device Failure: A device has failed if it does not perform according to labeling and negatively impacts the treatment while used according to the labeling.  
Device Malfunction : A device malfunction is an unexpected change to the device that is 
contradictory to the labeling and may or may not affect device performance.  
All reported device malfunctions or failures of the LimFlow Stent Graft System are required to be 
documented in the eCRF. In the event of a suspected observation or device problem, refer to the 
Manual of Operations for further instructions. Device failures and malfunctions should also be 
documented in the subject’s  medical record.

or an interposition graft performed for occlusion of the stent graft.  
 
CLINICALLY- DRIVEN MINOR RE- INTERVENTION OF THE STENT GRAFT  
Endovascular procedures (PTA, atherectomy, stenting) without thrombectomy / thrombolysis, and 
minor surgical revisions (patch angioplasty) performed to prevent occlusion of the stent graft.  
 
DETERIORATION IN RENAL FUNCTION / CONTRAST- INDUCED NE PHROPATHY  
An increase of > 25% in serum creatinine after using an iodine contrast agent, without another clear 
cause for kidney injury.  
 
EMBOLISM  
The sudden blocking of an artery by a clot or other material that has been brought to its site of 
lodgment by [CONTACT_106214] (embolus). Potential sources of emboli include blood clots, fat 
globules, air bubbles, tissue, clumps of bacteria, thrombus or foreign material.  
 
HEMATOMA  
A localized collection of extravasated blood in subcutaneous tissue, usually clotte d. A metric ruler 
should be used to measure the widest portion of the hematoma.

INTIMAL TEAR / DISSECTION  
Disruption of an arterial wall resulting in splitting and separation of the intimal (subintimal) layers.  
 
IPSILATERAL DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS  
Presence of a thrombus in the peripheral venous system of the ipsilateral limb. May be a 
complication of phlebitis or may result from injury to a vein or from prolonged bed rest. Symptoms 
include a feeling of heaviness, pain, warmth, or swelling in the affected part.  
 
IPSILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ARTERIAL EMBOLI  
Presence of emboli in the peripheral arterial system of the ipsilateral limb.  
 
LOCALIZED ACCESS SITE INFECTION Infection occurring at the access site requiring treatment with oral or intramuscular antibiotic 
therapy.  Does not include administration of prophylactic antibiotic regimens.  
 
MAJOR BLEEDING COMPLICATION  
Defined as blood loss resulting from the percutaneous revascularization procedure or adjunctive drug 
therapy requiring transfusions of blood product s. 
NYHA HEART FAILURE CLASSIFICATIONS  
I: Patients with cardiac disease but resulting in no limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical 
activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or angina pain.  
II: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable 
at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or angina pain.  
III: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are 
comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or angina pain. 
IV: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on physical activity without discomfort. 
Symptoms of heart failure or the angina syn drome may be present even at rest. If any physical 
activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.  
 
OCCLUSION OF THE STENT GRAFT  
Absence of flow on color Doppler, and/or absence of flow on angiographic images (conventional or 
CT). 
 
PERFORATION OF ARTERIAL VE SSEL WALL 
A hole or break in the arterial wall (e.g., from insertion/advancement of a percutaneous device) as seen on angiography, which may or may not require intervention.  
 
PERFORATION OF VENOUS VESSEL WALL  
A hole or break in the venous wall (e.g., from insertion/advancement of a percutaneous device).  
 
PERI- OPERATIVE DEATH

 - 4 -  1. Purpose/Specific Aims  
Contralateral Prophylactic Maste ctomy (CPM), a medically unnece ssary procedure for women 
with sporadic cancers, is rising exponentially. The goal of thi s study is to develop a theoretically 
guided, web-based DA (CPM-DA) for women with sporadic breast ca ncer to promote informed 
decision making. A web-based intervention was selected to allow  for improved options for 
dissemination and reach for future research. Development of the  CPM-DA will be accomplished 
in two phases.  Phase [ADDRESS_740880] a small randomized trial 
assigning patients to receive Usual Care or the CPM-DA. 
 
Primary Aim:  Is the intervention trial feasible?  
The purpose is to develop a feasible web-based DA. Thus, it is important that this trial provide 
evidence of feasibility. We will define feasibility as the rate  of acceptance and participation. 
These figures will be based on the randomized trial (Phase 2 of  the current study). First, we will 
examine acceptance as determined by [CONTACT_563960]. Second, 
we will examine the length of time for completing surveys.   
 
Secondary Aim 1:  
 
To provide preliminary data on the  impact of the CPM-DA on prep aredness to make the 
CPM decision, decisional conflict, CPM knowledge, psychosocial factors, Perceived risk for 
cancer in the healthy/ breast/metastatic disease, cancer recurr ence/metastasis worry, 
cancer distress and intention to have CPM. 
 
 
2. Background and Significance   
 
2.1. CPM among women with sporadic breast cancer . Rates of contralateral prophylactic 
mastectomies (CPM) are increasing but are not associated with i mproved survival among 
women diagnosed with sporadic breast cancer.  More than 242,[ADDRESS_740881] cancer (UBC, or cancer in one breast) an nually (American Cancer Society, 
2013). The rate of women with UBC choosing removal of the non-c ancerous breast, a 
procedure called contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) ha s risen exponentially (Cemal 
et al., 2013; Stucky et al., 2010, Arrington et al., 2009; Jone s et al., 2009). The use of CPM 
among women with a strong family history does not account for t he increase in CPM.  Rather, 
the increase is thought to be due to women without a strong fam ily history (henceforth referred 
to as women with sporadic cancers, or WSC) choosing CPM. Althou gh a case can be made for 
CPM among women with a strong family history of breast cancer(v an Sprundel et. al.,, 2005, 
Fayanju, et. al., 2014), CPM is not recommended for sporadic br east cancers because it does 
not reduce the risk for metastatic disease or improve survival( Peralta et. al., 2000, Herrinton et. 
al., 2005, Fayanju, et. al., 2014) . The Society of Surgical On cology’s position statement 
endorses CPM in the following situations: 1) BRCA 1-2 mutation;  2) high risk lesions (e.g.,

 - 5 -  atypi[INVESTIGATOR_389192], lobular carcinoma in situ); 3) pri or UBC; 4) difficulty following 
contralateral breast radiology, or; 5) cosmetic reasons (Societ y of Surgical Oncology, 2007).The 
arguments against routine CPM in patients who do not meet these  criteria are: 1) the risk of 
systemic disease exceeds the risk of a contralateral breast can cer; 2) the risk for contralateral 
breast cancer is low among WSC; 3) effective adjuvant treatment s such as chemotherapy, 
tamoxifen, and/or aromatase inhibitors for estrogen-receptive t umors reduce contralateral breast 
cancer risk by 50% (Bedrosian et al., 2010; Fisher et al., 1996 ); 4) breast surveillance with MRI 
is available; 5) CPM is associated with increased post-surgical  infection rates(Osman et al., 
2013); 6) CPM does not completely eliminate contralateral breas t cancer risk(Tuttle et al., 
2012).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_563943], an increasing percentage of WSC ch oose CPM, with an estimated 
9,160 surgeries performed in 2014 (extrapolated from data from the American Cancer Society, 
2014).  
 
2.2. Factors contributing to CPM decisions.   
Little is known about why women diagnosed with sporadic breast cancer choose CPM. The 
increased use of CPM among women with sporadic breast cancer is  thought to be related to 
several factors (Yi et. al., 2010): 1) improved post-mastectomy  reconstruction outcomes; 2) 
emotional distress about cancer, uncertainty, and the desire to  reduce future cancer risk which 
leads to a preference for aggressive treatments; 3) decision-ma king urgency, and; 4) 
information about CPM obtained from the media and internet. Bre ast cancer diagnosis can 
trigger distress and the desire to reduce the risk for future c ancer recurrence or spread. Studies 
suggest that women choosing CPM report higher cancer distress a nd general distress and 
greater perceived risk of recurrence at the time of CPM (King e t. al., 2013). As such, a key 
motivation for choosing CPM among women at sporadic risk is to decrease one’s risk for 
contralateral breast cancer, a desire to achieve peace of mind,  to improve survival, and prevent 
cancer from spreading(Rosenberg et. al., 2013, Soran et. al., 2 013).. However, CPM does not 
confer a significant survival advantage(Herrinton et. al., 2005 ) and actual risk for cancer in the 
healthy breast among women at sporadic cancer risk is low (Tutt le et. al., 2007). Indeed, women 
report knowing that CPM will not improve survival, but at the s ame time, they overestimate their 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_563944] (Rosenberg et. al., 2013). Studies suggest that women with sporadic breast 
cancer estimate that 10% of patients will develop contralateral  breast cancer without CPM over 
5 years, which overestimates the actual risk of about 2-4% over  5 years (Tuttle et. al., 2007). A 
second stressor that women face is that most treatments that co nfer life-time benefit are 
initiated in the first few months after diagnosis, and the deci sion process about surgical options 
is compressed into 2-3 weeks pre-surgery (Katz & Morrow, 2013).  Thus, there is pressure to 
make treatment decisions, which may lead patients to accept tre atments regardless of their 
risks and benefits (Katz & Morrow, 2013). A third motivator for  CPM decisions is information 
women receive from health professionals (Rosenberg et. al., 201 3) as well as information from 
the internet and/or media. Even when women are informed, they m ay not accurately recall or 
relate this information to their personal situation (Yi et. al. , 2010). Surgeons’ input may not be a 
key influence in CPM decisions ((Rosenberg et. al., 2013), as r esearch suggests that two-thirds 
of women indicate that their physician was not an important fac tor (Yi et. al., 2010). Instead, 
women attend to their own urgency and high-profile patients cho osing this surgery (Katz & 
Morrow, 2013). Indeed, surgeons may acquiesce to patients becau se they do not wish to lose 
the patient (Tuttle et. al., 2007). There have been no studies evaluating how CPM is discussed 
with surgeons pre-operatively. The expectation that CPM will pr ovide psychological relief is

CINJ#[ADDRESS_740882] cancer concern (Geiger et. al., 2008) 
and greater satisfaction with their breasts compared to women w ho do not choose CPM 
(Koslow et.al., 2013). Levels of distress and quality of life, however, do not differ(Geiger et. al., 
2008). Moreover, the procedure is not without adverse effects. Between 6% and 13.5% of 
women choosing CPM report decisional dissatisfaction (Geiger et . al., 2008),Montgomery et.al., 
1999, Altschuler et. al., 2008, Borgen et. al., 1998, Frost et. al., 2005, Frist et. al., 2011). 
Reasons for dissatisfaction include cosmetic appearance (Rosenb erg et. al., 2013, Montgomery 
et.al., 1999, Altschuler et. al., 2008), loss of breast sensati on (Altschuler et. al., 2008_, 
dissatisfaction with information regarding alternative options to CPM (Altschuler et. al., 2008), 
and loss of femininity (Montgomery et.al. 1999, Altschuler et. al., 2008). Unfortunately, because 
high-risk women are also included in these studies, the levels of long-term satisfaction, 
decisional regret, and body image for women with sporadic cance r selecting CPM are not well-
studied. CPM among women with sporadic breast cancer indicates that decisions are guided by 
[CONTACT_563961], 
when this surgery is not medica lly recommended. Many women stat e they do not receive 
information from doctors about reasons for not having CPM, and among those who do; 
physician input is not a key factor in the decision. Patient an xiety may interfere with effective 
decision making.   Decision Support Aids are Useful.  Studies suggest some women w ho choose CPM express 
decisional regret and dissatisfaction. It is difficult to form conclusions about decisional 
processes among women with sporadic breast cancer because studi es have included both high 
risk and sporadic risk breast cancer patients together. Thus, i t is not known whether women 
with sporadic breast cancer report the same levels of satisfact ion and quality of life after CPM. 
Because there is no clear medical rationale for CPM for these w omen, balanced information 
regarding CPM, clarification of actual cancer risk, bolstering efficacy to manage cancer anxiety, 
and presenting alternatives to CPM  may result in more informed decision-making.  Patients who 
face difficult treatment decisions in a medical situation where  information is not uniformly 
presented may benefit from decision support aids (DAs) to facil itate informed decision-making 
(Andersen et. al., 2009). DAs are used to supplement practition ers’ counseling and are 
designed to facilitate patients’ understanding of the options, help patients weigh advantages 
and disadvantages of each option, increase patients’ awareness of the personal importance 
attached to the benefits and risks of each option, and encourag e patients to engage with their 
health care providers in deciding which option to pursue (Ander sen et. al., 2009, ACS). Our 
team has developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] a decision support aid for breas t cancer patients undergoing 
mastectomy to facilitate informed decision making about breast reconstruction. The breast 
reconstruction decision aid (named BRAID) was highly rated and improved knowledge about 
reconstruction (Manne & Kirstein, unpublished data, see Appendi x E for screenshots). In the 
context of CPM decisions, DAs c an address cancer anxiety, teach  anxiety management skills, 
and provide personalized education about actual risk versus per ceived risk. Ultimately, 
improved decision making can contribute to greater long-term de cisional satisfaction (Fayanju 
et. al., 2014, Lostumbo et. al., 2010). Toward this end, we pro pose to develop a theoretically- 
guided, multiplatform, web-based DA (CPM-DA) for women with spo radic breast cancer to 
educate them regarding CPM. A multi platform intervention (deskt op computer/tablet) was 
selected to allow for improved options for dissemination and re ach for future research.

 - 7 -  2.3. Timeline for Decision Making.  Once a palpable mass or radiologic finding is identified, the 
patient has a biopsy within 1-2 weeks. Within one week, the bio psy result is given to the patient. 
At that time, the surgeon presents the surgical options (lumpec tomy, mastectomy), and surgery 
is scheduled within 1-2 weeks for lumpectomy and 2-3 weeks for mastectomy. Patients 
considering CPM consult a plastic surgeon, and then decide (bef ore the mastectomy) whether 
they wish to proceed with CPM. The decision making timeline is brief.  
2.4. Decisional processes .  As noted above, there is little known about how women make the  
CPM decision.  Although studies have shown that women choosing CPM are satisfied with their 
decision and many do not report regret (Geiger et al., 2008), o ther studies suggest that there is 
decisional regret and dissatisfaction in a subset of women (Ros enberg, et.al. 2013; Altschuler et 
al., 2008). It is difficult to form conclusions about decisiona l processes among WSC because 
studies have included both high risk and WSC patients together.  Thus, it is not known whether 
WSC report the same levels of satisfaction and quality of life after CPM. Because there is no 
clear medical rationale for CPM among WSC, balanced information  regarding CPM, clarification 
of actual cancer risk, bolstering efficacy to manage cancer anx iety and surveillance, and 
presenting alternatives to CPM m ay result in more informed deci sion-making.  
Health information-seeking behaviors support the need for web-b ased approach.  A review of 
patients undergoing CPM at CINJ in the last two years indicates  that 67% were White, 22% 
were Hispanic, 7.4% were Asian, and 3.6% were Black. The median  age was [ADDRESS_740883] 
that between 80- 85% of patients approached for the proposed st udy will have internet access 
(Cole et.al. 2013). The internet is an increasing source of hea lth information for healthy adults 
as well as patients copi[INVESTIGATOR_18499] a variety of medical conditions . Among internet users, 83% 
report having looked online for health information (Pew Interne t and American Life Project, 
2011). More than two-thirds of individuals diagnosed with cance r report looking for cancer 
information and the most common source of information is the In ternet (Pew Internet and 
American Life Project, 2011). Web-based information influences treatment decisions (Castleton 
et. al., 2011). Web-based interventions are effectively used to  enhance decision support for 
breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations (Schwartz et. al., 2 009) and to reduce distress for 
cancer patients (David et.al. 2013, Duffecy et. al., 2013, Gust afson et. al., 2001, Stanton et. al., 
2013).  Use and adherence is good, with figures ranging from 63 %34 to 86% (Stanton et.al., 
2013. 
2.5. Multi-platform Internet Approaches.  Cancer patients obtain information from their health 
providers, but are increasingly finding cancer information on t he internet (Metz et al., 2003; 
Castelton et al., 2011). Indeed, about 47-63% of breast cancer patients report searching for 
cancer information on the internet (Metz et al., 2003, Littlech ild & Barr, 2013). Internet 
information influences treatment decisions (Castelton et al., 2 011). Internet interventions are 
effectively used to enhance decision support for breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations 
(Schwartz et al., 2009) and to reduce distress for cancer patie nts (David et al., 2013; Duffecy et 
al., 2013; Gustafson et al., 2011; Stanton et al., 2013). Use a nd adherence is relatively high, 
with figures ranging from 63% (Schwartz et al., 2009) to 86% (S tanton et al., 2013). 
Multiplatform interventions (desktop, pamphlet, smartphone) are  currently the most common 
way individuals obtain information. Few studies have utilized t his platform in cancer treatment, 
although studies use the smart phone as a delivery mode for oth er health issues (Hyun et al., 
2013). It is thought that multiplatform applications will ultim ately enhance dissemination of

 - 8 -  health behavior interventions (Panayi et. al, 2013). Multiplatf orm interventions are currently the 
most common way individuals obtain web-based information.  Summary of Significance. CPM is a medically unnecessary procedu re for women diagnosed 
with sporadic breast cancer and is associated with increased ri sk for post-surgical 
complications. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], its use is rising in this populati on. We will develop a DA to facilitate 
well-informed and value-sensitive CPM decisions to improve deci sional preparedness, improve 
knowledge, reduce perceived risk and anxiety about recurrence, and improve patients’ ability to 
cope with anxiety about cancer recurrence. The web-based DA has  high potential to for future 
dissemination.    
Prior work: Facilitating informed decision making for breast re construction  (R21 
CA149531). This study evaluates the acceptability/efficacy of a  breast reconstruction decision 
aid (BRAID) to assist women with making the decision about reco nstruction. BRAID is being 
compared with a publicly-available pamphlet. 80% of participant s logged into BRAID and it was 
highly rated (Manne et al., 2010; Manne et al., 2007). The goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a 
CD-ROM decision aid to facilitate informed consent for MSI test ing. The decision aid increased 
knowledge and preparedness and reduced decisional conflict.  
 
3. Research Design and Methods  
 
The Team.  Our research team has consider able expertise and experience in  the following 
substantive and methodological areas necessary to carry out the  proposed: decision support aid 
development ( Manne, ITX ); breast cancer surgery and oncology ( Kirstein, Smith, Toppmeyer, 
Brill, Grana ); health behavior theories ( Manne,  Hudson ); internet interventions ( Manne, ITX ); 
qualitative mixed methods analysis (Hudson)and biostatistics an d research methods ( Kashy, 
Ohman-Strickland ). Our team also includes a community advisory panel. ITX is a software 
product development company that will design the decision suppo rt aid for this project. ITX 
Corporation will program the website based on the requirements defined by [CONTACT_5051]. 
They have completed necessary paperwork to partner with Rutgers  Cancer Institute of New 
Jersey researchers on this project. Grana (Consultant) is a bre ast oncologist and Cooper 
Cancer Institute Director with personal experience with CPM. Br ill (Consultant) is a breast 
surgeon from Cooper Cancer Instit ute. They will serve as Year [ADDRESS_740884]  of three patients who selected CPM to ensure that the 
information presented is balanced. This study entails two phase s: A developmental phase for 
the CPM-DA (Phase 1) and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_563945] (phase 2) . Phase 1 participants will be 
recruited from CINJ and Phase 2 participants will be recruited from CINJ, MSKCC and 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
 
3.1. Phase 1: PROTOTYPE DEVELOPM ENT AND TESTING (Month1-16). The first year 
will be devoted to the development of the web-based DA prototyp e. The DA will be 
multiplatform, accessible via computer, tablet, and smartphone.  We plan for the development to 
take 9 months, but the actual timeline may vary based on comple tion of the steps outlined. Step 
1: Interview patients to obtain data about important informatio n they would like to have and 
reasons why they would consider having or not having CPM. Step 2: Develop the DA prototype. 
Step 3: Obtain feedback from patients about the prototype.

 - 9 -  PHASE 1 During Phase 1, we will interview 24 women ([ADDRESS_740885] 5 years, but considered it; and [ADDRESS_740886] 5 years) 
regarding CPM-DA content preferences.  Additional eligibility for Phase 1 interviewees:   1. Has a first, Primary diagnosis of unilateral Stage 0, 1, 2,  or 3a breast cancer [patients with 
bilateral breast cancer will be excluded from participation]  2. > 18 years 
 3. Speaks and reads English  4.  WSC [does not have hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndro me (BRCA carrier, strong  
family history]. If there is any  uncertainty, the surgeon will use the Tyrer-Cuzick (Tyrer et al., 
2004) risk model to calculate risk. The Tyrer-Cuzick model calc ulates a personal lifetime risk 
of breast cancer based on multiple factors. It has become the s tandard model because it 
incorporates not only factors such as estrogen exposure and fir st degree relatives, but also 
second degree relatives and paternal lineage. A lifetime risk o f 20% or greater is considered 
high risk and would necessitate increased screening methods to the traditional annual 
mammogram. For this study, anyone with a lifetime risk up to 19 % on the Tyrer-Cuzick 
model will be considered average risk for breast cancer. Anyone  with a lifetime risk of 20% 
or greater will be excluded from participation.  
 5.  Able to provide meaningful informed consent.    To ensure a heterogeneous population, we will obtain a represen tative sample of age, ethnicity, 
and post-CPM experiences (e.g., complications, no complications ).  
 To obtain 24 women we anticipate approaching about 35 women. Th e acceptance rate for the 
interview phase of our BRAID study was > 90%.    For patients who did not have CPM, we will identify women havin g unilateral mastectomy or 
lumpectomy in the past [ADDRESS_740887] 5 years, we will identif y women from the records of 
CINJ’s breast surgeons. Data from 2013-2014 indicates there are  approximately 50 CPMs 
performed annually. This will allow sufficient sampling for Ste p 1.  Patients will be sent a study 
description and a toll free number to decline. If the participa nt does not decline, they will be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].   In all sub-groups, eligible women who consent will be asked to attend a 60 minute interview and 
paid $65 for their time and travel to the interview.  
Interview: Questions ask patients about experiences with CPM, reasons they  chose and did 
not choose CPM, and CPM satisfaction. The interviews will be au diotaped and videotaped and 
notes will be taken to share with the study team. Interviews wi ll be transcribed and

 - 10 -  recommendations tabulated. Interview tapes will be marked with a study ID #. Analysis of the 
Step 1 data will follow common dictates of qualitative data ana lysis: data reduction, data 
display, and conclusion drawing and verification. A template, c ontent analysis will be conducted. 
[CONTACT_212486] will lead the proposed qualitative analyses. Specifi cally, themes important for DA 
development will be identified based on the a priori theoretica l model (Social Cognitive Theory). 
Data will be explored in the context of the model (e.g., What a re the key CPM knowledge gaps? 
How do the patients think about risk? How do they manage fear a nd take a measure of control? 
How do their social networks (e.g., family, partners, friends) influence their decision making? 
What input from the surgeon did they find helpful?). New themes  that emerge from interviews 
will also be explored. We will engage in iterative cycles of re ading, summarizing, and re-reading 
the data 47-48 until thematic saturation has occurred. We antic ipate that a sample of 24 women 
(12 per group) 49 will be needed to achieve thematic saturation  across and within groups. An 
index of themes will be applied systematically to the data and tracked using ATLAS.ti, a 
qualitative data analysis software. Data analyses will continue  until theme saturation or no new 
themes emerge related to key content areas for the DA.  We will  use this information to guide 
key content areas for the DA. 
 
We will be taking photographs of CINJ patients’ surgical outcom es of their breasts to be 
included in the DA. All patients will be asked to sign an IRB-a pproved HIPAA release for 
the use of photographs. We will not include the patient’s name,  photographs of her face, 
or any other identifying information. We will include informati on on the type of surgical 
procedure the patient underwent.    PHASE 1, Step 2.  Prototype development, Months 6-13:

Conceptual Frameworks Guiding the CPM-DA. Our work will be guided by [CONTACT_563964] (O’Conner et al., 1999; O’Conner et al., 1995; 
O’Conner et al., 1998)  as well as Social Cognitive Theory
 (Bandura, 1986) The Ottawa 
framework (O’Conner et al., 1998; O’Conner et al., 2002) has three elemen ts: assessing 
decision needs, providing decision support, and evaluating deci sion making and outcomes.

 - 11 -  Assessing needs in four areas is key: 1) perceptions - level of knowledge and receptivity to 
making choices; 2) perceptions of others – decision support, ot hers’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153], and preferred role 
in decision making; 3) resources – copi[INVESTIGATOR_563946], and; 4) personal characteristics- e.g., a ge, ethnicity. An optimal decision 
is informed, consistent with personal values, acted upon, and r esults in high satisfaction 
(O’Conner et al., 1997). In the oncology context, decision supp ort aids facilitate decisions about 
breast cancer risk reduction among women considering BRCA  genetic testing (Green et al., 
2004; Wakefield et al., 2008) and breast surgery (Goel et al., 2009;  Jibaja-Weisset al., 2006). 
Our approach will include all aspects of the framework. Informa tion will be provided to increase 
knowledge about options; a description of possible outcomes wil l be included to make 
expectations more realistic; augmenting decision skills by [CONTACT_563965][INVESTIGATOR_563947]. In ad dition, because anxiety is the key 
motivating factor behind CPM, content will include management s kills for worry about breast 
cancer recurrence as well as information about their actual ris k. Social cognitive theory 
(Bandura, 1986) outlines factors that influence health decisions/behaviors and outlines cognitive 
and affective influences of change. Social cognitive theory con structs we will use include 
perceived risk of cancer recurrence, emotional representations of breast cancer (fear of 
recurrence), self-efficacy, and social influence. Self-efficacy  is conceptualized as the confidence 
to manage anxiety about breast cancer in the future and the con fidence to follow up with cancer 
surveillance.  Social influence includes input from doctor, oth er health professionals, family, 
friends, internet, and media.   
The Layout of the DA is as planned:  Module 1  (2 minutes) contains an orientation/tutorial 
program which describes the DA, how to navigate it, and provide s basic training. Module 2  (5 
minutes) is a risk education module that addresses perceptions and facts about contralateral 
BC risk. Module 3  ( 5 minutes) presents medical facts about with CPM. The sectio n will be 
guided by [CONTACT_563966]: “What does a reconstructed breas t look like?” “Is there a 
difference in recovery time if I choose CPM?” and “Are there mo re complications possible if I 
choose CPM?” Participants can select not to view graphic illust rations.  Module 4  (10 minutes) 
is an anxiety assessment and self-efficacy enhancement tool. Be cause anxiety about 
recurrence in the other breast is a primary motivator for CPM, this module addresses that 
anxiety. Patients will rate the degree of worry about recurrenc e in the other breast and 
metastatic disease and their confidence in copi[INVESTIGATOR_563948]. A patient video will accompany with each str ategy. We will use the fear of 
recurrence session materials from our ongoing grant for women w ith gynecological cancer as a 
guide. Module 5  (10-15 minutes) contains personal narratives from women who ch ose or did 
not choose CPM. Patients from CINJ will be interviewed by [CONTACT_563962] . Women will discuss the 
process they went through to make the decision, including value s and preferences they 
weighed, and other concerns they had. Four clips will be select ed that provide balanced 
information regarding satisfaction with the decision and possib le complications. Module 6  (10 
minutes). is the interactive decision section which guides part icipants through the advantages 
and disadvantages of CPM. The participant will rank and weigh m otivations, consider others’ 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153], and assess assistance they might want. The final scre en will summarize responses. It 
will not specifically endorse a decision, but rather will encou rage women to discuss relevant 
options/contraindications of CPM with their surgeon, family, an d friends.

 Procedures. Participants from Step 1 will be asked to attend a 90 minute session at CINJ. From 
the 24 participants from Step 1, we will enroll 10 women, with equal representation of women 
who had/did not have CPM. Participants will navigate and provid e feedback on modules. 
Participants will be paid $65.00 for their time and travel. .  Interview. The questions ask about the quality and preference f or graphic illustrations, the depth 
and complexity of the information, what they like/do not like a bout the personal narratives, what 
knowledge, risks, and possible benefits that were missed or are  not relevant, and if they have 
additional content suggestions. Ease of navigation will be obse rved and usability measures 
administered (ASQ) Final Alterations (Months 14-16). The team will listen to the a udiotapes of the interviews, review 
notes, and summarize the issues. We will discuss and implement necessary alterations to the 
DA as well as incorporate feedback from the usability testing. Conference calls will be planned 
with the team to discuss the issues identified and decide wheth er the DA content needs 
alteration.  Web accessibility. ITX will ensure that the web-site functions the same in as many Web 
browsers as possible. ITX will update the site content and func tionality . As a final step , 
participants who  provided feedback will be asked to review the  site again to assess their 
feedback . ITX and Manne/Kirstein’s team will perform beta and break tes ting which consists of 
performing every possible user action to ensure that the progra mming does not break and will 
function reliably under a variety of conditions. We will finali ze the DA after these steps. 
 
3.2. Phase 2: CPM-DA FEASIBILITY TRIAL  (Months 17-24) 
The primary goal is to evaluate whether women will participate,  use the DA, and evaluate the 
DA positively. A second goal is to gather pi[INVESTIGATOR_563949], psychological constructs, decisional conflict, and p reparedness. We will conduct a 
small randomized trial assigning patients to receive Usual Care  or the CPM-DA.

2004) risk model to calculate risk. For this study, anyone with  a lifetime risk up to 19% on 
the Tyrer-Cuzick model will be considered average risk for brea st cancer. Anyone with a 
lifetime risk of 20% or greater will be excluded from participa tion.

when a new consent and baseline have been received. The Rutgers  coordinator or appropriate 
study staff will randomize from the master file in the order in  which notification of a new 
consent/baseline packet was received. The master file will be u pdated and research staff at all 
sites will be notified of the randomization. Rutgers study staf f will notify participants of their 
randomization via email or a phone call. If applicable, Rutgers  staff will provide participants with 
the CPM-DA website address, a secure password, and website navi gation instructions. MSKCC 
will request to collect limited data in the form of a patient r efuser form that will cause no more 
than minimal risk to patients that decide not to participate in  MSKCC protocol #16-1396.  The 
refuser form contains no PHI.  This refuser form will be comple ted by [CONTACT_563968] a patient in clinic that declines to participate in  the study.  The refuser form will then

3.2.3. Sample Size for RCT . We anticipate we will recruit participants for about 6months 
(months 17-22). Our goal is to enroll 90 to 130 women (65 in UC  and 65 in CPM DA). We are 
anticipating a 70-75% acceptance rate based on our BRDA study. To obtain N = 130 (90 
MSKCC, 10 CINJ, 30 MGH), we estimate approaching 169-[ADDRESS_740896] that it is not 
medically indicated, and does not reduce the risk of the spread  of cancer. If interested, the 
patient is referred to a plastic surgeon.

4.1.4. Psychosocial factors.  1) Risk perception - [ADDRESS_740899] and how much CPM reduces risk  (Rosenberg et al.,  2013); 2) Reasons for CPM - 
11 reasons (Rosenberg et al.,  2013); will be assessed ; 3)Self-efficacy– 3 items assess 
confidence in managing worry about cancer recurrence, complying  with surveillance, and worry 
about surveillance . 4) Social influence - Item asks how much doctors talked about reasons to 
have/not have CPM; 5) Importance of input -Items ask how important input from surgeon, nurse, 
family/friends, internet, media is in the decision (Rosenberg et al.,  2013).  
4.1.5. Decision factors:  Satisfaction with/completeness of preparation . The Satisfaction with 
the Decision-making Process Survey (Barry et al., 1997) assesses satisfaction with a number of 
factors including the amount of information, how information wa s presented, and how prepared 
they are to make a decision.

4.2. Follow-up Measures  4.2.1. Follow-up surveys  (20m). All baseline measures except demographics will be given .  
4.2.2. Process Evaluation:  1) DA Evaluation  (DA arm only). Ratings include: extent that they 
used the DA, comprehensiveness of information, whether it prese nted material in a balanced 
manner, whether it influenced the decision, whether it was help ful in making the decision, 
whether it was helpful in understanding pros and cons, and whet her they used the information in 
a discussion with the surgeon. Items are based on Brug (Brug et  al., 2005)
 and previous 
research (Manne et al., 2010; Manne et al., 2005) 2) DA implementation evaluation . We will 
assess: a) log ins and time in DA; b) time spent in each module ; c) number of pages printed 
out/sent to mobile device; d) ease of accessing and navigating the web-based application at 
home or at the center; 3) User Interface Satisfaction (Lund, 2001) assesses usefulness, ease of 
use, ease of learning and satisfaction with online tools. Feedb ack will be collected at the time of 
the first follow-up survey, but we may also contact [CONTACT_3445] s by [CONTACT_21197] a short debriefing

CINJ#[ADDRESS_740903] (IRB). (The approval process included: obtaining a Techno logy Professional Service 
Agreement and a Business Associate Agreement from DatStat; the approval of a Security 
Questionnaire from the Rutgers Office of Information Technology ; and the completion of a 
Security Risk and Assessment Tool by [CONTACT_563979].) The 
software allows for research study personnel to be assigned dat a access and privileges specific 
to their role on the study. Online surveys will be completed by  [CONTACT_87597] a 
secure website (hosted on DatStat servers) developed and mainta ined by [CONTACT_563980].  DatStat secure servers are registered with site certificates pr ovided by [CONTACT_563981]. As each user moves through t he survey form, his/her 
responses are encrypted while in-transit between the browser an d DatStat's server using SSL 
(Secure Sockets Layer) and 40, 56, or 128-bit Public Key Encryp tion. All servers used for data 
collection are highly fault-tolerant and equipped with redundan t, hot-pluggable power supplies, 
redundant network interfaces, and RAID 5 hot-swappable disk sto rage. All primary servers are 
plugged into a monitored, uninterruptible power supply (UPS). D atStat servers are stored in a 
locked server cabinet/rack, which are housed in a state-of-the- art, well-ventilated data center. 
Physical access to servers and data backup is restricted to a m inimal number of information 
technology professionals. The servers are secured with physical  and firewall security.  
 
 
 
5.1. Primary Aim: Is the intervention trial feasible?  
Approach and Analysis  
For feasibility, 2 questions will be addressed: 1) Are patients joining/staying in the trial? We judge this study feasible if the participation rate (consented and complete baseline) is equal to or greater than 70% and the retention rate at follow-up is 85%. These “yardsticks” were selected to ensure there is sufficient interest to proceed to a larger scale trial. 2) Are participants using the DA in the way that was intended? We will evaluate log-ins, pages viewed, and how long modules are viewed. If participants review more than 75% of the pages, we will consider this acceptable usage. To evaluate the acceptability, we will

 - 21 -  examine: whether participants use the DA, to what degree they use it, and factors predicting 
uptake and use. We will also look at whether patients 1) opened the web aid and 2) viewed each page. First, basic descriptive information will be gathered regarding participant log-ins and number and duration of log-ins. Second, DA evaluation and User Interface Satisfaction surveys will be examined.  
We will judge the DA as acceptable if 75% of participants used it and if the average score was > 
5.6/7 on the DA evaluation. Using  regression analyses , we will examine the following for 
association with DA use: younger age, internet familiarity, and  higher education. The small 
sample (N = 40) and limited range of correlate categories limit s options for statistical analyses. 
Missing values will be imputed from observed information (SAS Procedures MI  and 
MIANALYZE). Confidence intervals and inferential procedures will adjust for uncertainty due to 
imputation.

Power . We expect to approach a maximum of 140 to enroll 100 women.  If 100 women are 
enrolled in the  study by [CONTACT_941] 140th patient approached and 85/100 participants complete the 
survey, then we will declare the study feasible. We chose the sample size and decision rules so that the probability of declaring feasibility would be approximately 5% under unacceptable rates of acceptance and completion and exceed 95% under acceptable rates. Power calculations are 
in Table 1.  If the true acceptance and completion rates are 65% and 79%, respectively, which 
we consider to be too low to warrant further research, then the probability of declaring feasibility would be 5%. If the true acceptance and completion rates are 70% and 85%, respectively, which we consider large enough to warrant further research, then the probability of declaring feasibility would be 96%.These figures are based on binomial distributions 
5.2. Secondary Aim 2: What is the impact of DA on CPM knowledge , psychosocial 
factors, decisional conflict, completeness of preparation, and CPM intention?  
Approach and Analysis.   Our outcomes are knowledge, perceived risk for recurrence, cancer 
worry, copi[INVESTIGATOR_563956], anxiety, decisional conflict, preparedness, and intention. We anticipate that [ADDRESS_740904] methods (means, medians, standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals) for the sample and separately by [CONTACT_30157]. In exploratory analyses, we will use two sample repeated measures to compare outcomes using an intent-to-treat approach. We will assess associations among the outcome variables using Pearson’s correlation coefficients.  We will also characterize the patterns of missing data.

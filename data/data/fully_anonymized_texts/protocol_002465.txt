Background, Rationale and Context 
 Patient compliance and insurance coverage with eye drops in cataract surgery has become a major hurdle in successful cataract surgery. One of the major complications of cataract surgery is post-operative pain and cys toid macular edema (CME).
1,[ADDRESS_1240406] surgery and include both topi[INVESTIGATOR_886419] -steroidal anti -inflammatory agents 
(NSAIDs). Issues with these drops include patient difficulty in application , compl iance, 
generic substitution and insurance coverage. A large percentage of patients aren’t able to afford these drops or often aren’t covered by [CONTACT_38279]. In addition, pharmacists often substitute the intended therapy for a generic version or inadequate drug alternative .

Recently, Omidria (phenylephrine and ketorolac injection 1% / 0.3% ) was FDA approved 
for post-operative pain and inflammation in patients undergoing cataract surgery. It is also indicated to maintain pupil dilation during cataract surgery, and is therefore the main reason it is used. Omidria is not a topi[INVESTIGATOR_886420] a constant infusion of phenylephrine and ketorolac  added to the irrigate used during cataract surgery.

 We propose to observe whether treating  patients with  Omidria (phenylephrine and 
ketorolac injection  1% / 0.3% ) during cataract surgery, will not only control post-
operative pain and inflammation but also reduce or e liminate cystoid macular edema 
without adjunctive topi[INVESTIGATOR_35791]. Potentially all of [CONTACT_192096]’s patients undergoing 
cataract surgery would be recruited by a study team member, as Omidria is beneficially 
in maintaining pupil dilation during cataract surgery, and makes the surgery less risky. 
Only patients which meet an exclusion criterion, such as an allergy to NSAIDs, would not be recruited to participate in the study.   
Objectives  
 Primary Objective:  To determine whether intracameral infusion of Omidria is sufficient alone to prevent post-operative CME and macular thickening . 
• Hypothesis 1 : The administration  of Omidria will be sufficient to reduce 
macular thickening without topi[INVESTIGATOR_886424] . 
• Hypothesis 2 : The administration of Omidria will be sufficient to prevent 
post-operative cystoid macular edema (CME) after routine cataract surgery.  
 Secondary Objective:  To observe whether any patients need additional topi[INVESTIGATOR_886425].  
• Hypothesi s 1.  The administration of Omidria  during cataract surgery will 
preclude any additional need for topi[INVESTIGATOR_900]-inflammatory drops. 
 
Methods and Measures  
 
• Design  
 
A prospective  interventional  study looking at whether Omidria infusion alone during cataract 
surgery is effective at eliminating  post-operative cystoid macular edema and/or macular 
thickening. We will recruit  [ADDRESS_1240410] the following demographic data :  age, gender, and race. In addition, the presence 
of macular cysts will be recorded, as well as central macular thickness. Best corrected spectacle 
acuity will be recorded as well and all data will be stored on a password protected and encrypted 
computer.  
 
• Setting  
 
The study will be performed at  Davie Medical Center  at Bermuda Run and will only 
involve patients undergoing cataract surgery by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Walter.  
 
Subject selection criteria  
 
Subjects will be recruited through direct asking  by a study team member (not [CONTACT_192096])  at the 
time of cataract diagnosis and selected to participate based on the following inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  
 
• Inclusion criteria:    
o Adults age 55- [ADDRESS_1240411] surgery under local 
anesthesia via either phacoemulsification and/or femtosecond assisted cataract 
surgery. Well -contr olled diabetes, hypertension will be included .  
o Females of childbearing potential must agree to use a reliable method of birth control while participating in this study. Reliable methods of birth control are: abstinence, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), DepoProvera, tubal ligation or vasectomy of the partner (with confirmed neg ative sperm counts) 
in monogamous relationship (same partner). An acceptable, although less reliable, method involves the careful use of condoms and spermicidal foam or gel and/or cervical cap or sponge. A pregnancy test is required at least [ADDRESS_1240412] normal menstrual period, if the patient is a sexually active female of childbearing potential. 
  
• Exclusion criteria :  
o Allergy to Phenylephrine or NSAIDs.  
o Inability to sit steady and upright for the OCT.  
o Complications during surgery, including posterior capsular rupture, vitreous 
loss, zonular dialysis, or iris trauma.  
o Macular thickness above [ADDRESS_1240413] -operatively.  
o Inability to return for follow appointments  
o Female patients who are pregnant, lactating or planning to become pregnant during the course of treatment.  
 
Sample size : 200 patients total.  
  
Study Procedure  
 
• Informed Consent Process:  After the patient has been evaluated and meets all of the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, a study team member  besides [CONTACT_192096]  will introduce 
the study at the time of the subjects’ cataract evaluation  or at the pre-operative work up. 
This typi[INVESTIGATOR_886426] 1 to 8 weeks prior to surgery. The study will be discussed in 
detail and consent  form (appendix 1) will be provided for the patient to review. Writ ten 
informed consent will be obtained at either at the pre -op holding area or the week prior at 
the work up for surgery. Written informed consent will only be obtained once the patient 
has been given time to fully understand the study. If the patient agree s, patients will plan 
to forsake topi[INVESTIGATOR_886427]. As per standard for cataract surgery, patients will return 
the following day, where the usual measurements will  be taken including visual acuity, 
intraocular pressure, and measurement of anterior cell and flare. The subjects will also 
return for post op visits at [ADDRESS_1240414] will be obtained.  
• Study Procedure : The enrolled subjects will undergo standard topi[INVESTIGATOR_886428] (with or without laser assistance) using Omidria, as labeled by [CONTACT_1622], throughout  the cataract surgery.  The Omidria will be provided at no cost to the 
patient nor the hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and will be provided by [CONTACT_886434]. The subjects will be monitored 
for any usual or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_886429]-operatively . If the patients have atypi[INVESTIGATOR_886430], 
anterior chamber cell greater than 2+, or macular thickening greater than [ADDRESS_1240415] surgery .   
 
Outcome Measures  
 
• Best corrected visual acuity at baseline (pre -op), 2 weeks and 6 weeks.  
• Presence of Cystoid Macular Edema at 2 weeks and 6 weeks 
• Macular thickness at baseline (pre -op), 2 weeks and 6 weeks  
• Need for a topi[INVESTIGATOR_609008] (rescue med)  and reason 
• Anterior chamber cell and flare at [ADDRESS_1240416] showed an  incidence of CME at 
3.6%9. [CONTACT_192096], with unpublished data using Omidria on routine cataract surgery, has 
noted a low incidence of CME at less than 0.5%. We are hopi[INVESTIGATOR_886431].

Subject Recruitment Methods  
 
Subjects will be recruited though direct asking at the time of scheduling their cataract surgery. Patients who decline to participate will be treated exactly the same during and after surgery as 
those that consent to participate.  Participants  will be not compensated  directly but will likely 
benefit from not having to pay a co-pay on the normally used topi[INVESTIGATOR_609008] . Because of the 
potential conflict of interest with Omeros, [CONTACT_192096] will not participate in recruiting nor during the consenting process. [CONTACT_886438] will be the medical safety monitor and will review charts and insure no patients were inappropriately recruited or consented.  
 
Informed Consent  
 
Signed informed consent will be obtained from each subject. The study will be introduced by [CONTACT_886435] a study team member  once 
the patient fully understands the study. Informed consent will be given 1 or more weeks prior  to 
the patient’s surgery, giving them plenty of time to decide and fully understand the study. Final 
written consent will be obtained  by [CONTACT_886436] -operative work up .  
 
Confidentiality and Privacy  
 
Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_21176], minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that could directly identify subjects, and maintaining all study information in a secure manner.  To help ensure subject privacy and confidentiality, only a unique study identifier will 
appear on the data collection form.  Any collected patient identifying information 
corresponding to the unique study identifier will be maintained on a linkage file, store sepa rately from the data.  The linkage file will be kept secure, with access limited to 
designated study personnel.  Following data collection subject identifying information will be destroyed [ADDRESS_1240417]. Giegengack  will be responsible for the overall monitoring of the data a nd safety of study 
participants.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_117657]. The study will cease to enroll patients if the CME rate rises above 20%, or if more 
than half of the patients have atypi[INVESTIGATOR_886432]/or inf lammation requiring a topi[INVESTIGATOR_609008]. 
Greg Russell or a member of his team will help with statistical analysis as we begin data collection.  
 
Pregnancy in Female Patients  
 
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately (no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy) if pregnancy occurs during the study. If pregnancy occurs, the patient will be withdrawn from the study, and the investigator will discuss the risk of pregnancy and the possible effects to the fetus. Monitoring of the pregnancy will occur until the conclusion of the pregnancy. 
 
 
Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events, or Deviations  
 
Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol 
changes will be promptly reported by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_659180]. [CONTACT_886439] has agreed to serve as an unbiased medical monitor.

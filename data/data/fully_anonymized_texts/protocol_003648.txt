1. Summary  
Cesarean deliveries performed during the second stage of labor can be very difficult due to 
impaction of the fetal head deep in the maternal pelvis and is associated with increased risk of 
both maternal and perinatal complications. On preliminary review, 1 6% of cesarean deliveries at 
Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200323] 1/1/2017 were performed during the second stage, making this a 
common situation encountered by [CONTACT_273103]. There is little existing data to inform 
management of deeply impacted fetal heads, therefore t hese situations can be difficult for 
surgeons and other healthcare staff when they arise. Our study aims to determine the morbidity 
of second stage cesarean deliveries before and after implementation of simulation protocols that 
address delivery of the imp acted fetal head for Ob/gyn surgeons, nursing staff, and surgical 
technicians at Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
2. Study Aims  
The primary aim of this study is to assess change in maternal and perinatal morbidity of second 
stage cesarean section during the time period s before and after simulation education for Ob/gyn 
surgeons, nursing staff, and surgical technicians at Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273085], where the simulation 
education is not occurr ing. The simulation protocol is a Quality Improvement activity  that 
addresses delivery of the impacted fetal head in second stage cesarean section.  
 
• Research question 1.1: Does implementation of a simulation protocol decrease  a composite 
variable of maternal morbidity defined as a) extension of uterine incision,  b) operative blood 
loss > 1000 mL  c) requirement of transfusion, d) wound infection within 6 weeks , and d) 
endometritis within [ADDRESS_333699] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]?   
• Research question 1.2: Does implementation of a simulation protocol decrease a composite 
variable of infant morbidity defined as  a) 5 minute APGARs <7, b) NICU admission, c) 
umbilical cord arteria l pH <7.1, and d) fetal injury of cesarean delivery during the second 
stage of labor at Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273086]?  
 
The secondary aim s of this study are to 1) assess provider confidence with deli very of the 
impacted fetal head before and after participating in simulation education and 2) assess change 
in maternal and perinatal morbidity of additional secondary outcomes , 3) assess the association 
of duration of second stage and maternal and perinatal outcomes .  
 
• Research question 2.1: Does Regions hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273087]?  
• Research question 2 .2: Does implementation of a simulation prot ocol that addresses 
delivery of the impacted fetal head decrease morbidity  of other individual secondary 
outcomes (see variables table)  of cesarean delivery during the second stage of labor at 
Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273088] d at Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]?  
• Research question 2. 3: Is duration of second stage related to maternal and perinatal 
complications?  
 
[ADDRESS_333700] often due to difficult delivery of the 
impacted fetal head [1,2,3,4]. The number of second stage cesarean deliveries is projected to 
increase for several reasons, particularly due to the overall decr ease in operative vaginal 
deliveries and proposed lengthening of the permissible duration of the second stage of labor [3].  
There have been few prospective studies that have compared the two traditional methods of 
delivery of an impacted fetal head, elevat ing the fetal head through the vagina (push method) or 
reverse breech extraction (pull method). These studies have suggested that the pull method is 
associated with fewer complications [3, 4, 5, 6] ; however , there is no definitive, evidence based 
algorithm to guide management of these difficult deliveries. Because extraction of the fetal head 
during second stage deliveries can be an obstetric emergency, it necessitates team and 
provider education to facilitat e anticipation, communication and timely management by [CONTACT_273104]. Team simulations for obstetric emergencies have been shown to assist with provider 
comfort, improved clarity of thinking, and quicker action during emergency situations resulting in 
improved outcomes. Our study aims to show that simulation education for the entire obstetric 
team can decrease morbidity of difficult fetal head extraction associated with second stage 
cesarean deliveries and improve provider and nursing staff confidence re garding anticipation 
and management of this emergency.  
 
QI Project Description:  
The simulation education project is not being conducted primarily for the purpose of research, 
but is a department -wide educational activity and QI project that will be requi red for all OB staff 
physicians, residents, nursing staff, and surgical techs at Regions hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273089].  There are 120 providers or “birth center cesarean section delivery team members” at 
Regions hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Each staff person is req uire to attend one of the sessions. There will be [ADDRESS_333701] survey 
6 months after the simulation event will also be distributed to assess team member confidence 
regarding second stage cesarean sections.  
 
The timeline of the simulation will be as follows: Pre simulation survey - 10 min, ACOG second 
stage cesarean section slide presentation - 20 min, practice with mannequins (separate for 
nursing and physician providers based on skill sets required) - [ADDRESS_333702] period for new Birth 
Center staff.    
 
4. Approach  
a. Study design: This study is an observational , time (pre vs. post simulation) by [CONTACT_19313]  
(Regions vs. Methodist) design using a retrospective programmatic and manual chart review to 
evaluate the morbidity of second stage cesarean deliveries before and after implementation of 
[ADDRESS_333703] survey s. 
 
b. Population  
i. Inclus ion/Exclusion criteria:  
Patient inclusion: The patient study population includes all patients age 18 -45 who 
underwent cesarean section during the second stage of labor (during the time period 
July [ADDRESS_333704] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) . Second stage is 
defined as the time between complete cervical dilation and delivery of the infant. 
Exclusion criteria include patients who underwent cesarean section in second stage for 
malpresentations (i.e., breech and noncephalic presentations ), patie nts who underwent 
cesarean section prior to [ADDRESS_333705] verified the accuracy of this method of identifying  
cesarean section during the second stage of labor by [CONTACT_12783] -checking a Clarity pull of 
EMR data with chart audit  for a random sample of 10 p atients.  
 
Medical staff inclusion criteria: all 120 staff members (staff physicians, residents, nurses, 
surgical te chnicians) at Regions hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273090] (50 physicians and 65 nurses and 5 techs)  and 
completed the s urvey s as part of the QI simulation project . 
 
ii. Sample size  
Patients: A data pull conducted by [CONTACT_273105] [ADDRESS_333706] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273091]. This study will gather data via programming and chart audit on the 
following counts of patients  in these time period : 
 
A. July 1,  2014  – June 30, 2015 (80 Regions patients)  
B. July 1, 2015  – June 30, 2016  (80 Regions patients)  
C. July 1,  2016  – December 31, 2017 ([ADDRESS_333707]) - 18 mo PRE period  
D. January 1, 2018 – June 30, 2019 ([ADDRESS_333708])  - [ADDRESS_333709] -period patients. Thus, t he total patient sample size for these resear ch question 
is expected to be n=480. For research question 2. 3, in addition to Groups C and D, we 
will also include utilize the [ADDRESS_333710] (n=640 total).  
 
Medical staff sample size: The simulation center staff will survey 120 staff (50 
physicians, 65 nurses, and 5 techs) immediately befor e and after the required simulation 
education  as part of an existing QI project . This QI project data will be used to address 
[ADDRESS_333711] and second survey s of 100% (because staff are surveyed at the 
simulation event), we will have n=[ADDRESS_333712] and second surveys. The response 
rate for the 6 month survey is expected to be 80%, yielding 96 surveys for this time 
period.  
 
c. Data collection process  
 
i. Data sources : Data sources for this study are: 1. Data pull from HP electronic medical 
record; 2. chart review; and 3. medical staff surveys from the simulation QI project.  
 
Patient sample: A Clarity pull of EMR data  by [CONTACT_273106]. For data elements not readily available with a 
programmatic data pull, two University of Minnesota medical students along with [CONTACT_273112] will conduct manual chart reviews  of 640 patients to obtain the needed 
data elemen ts (see outcomes table below).  
 
Staff sample: Staff-provided information from the simulation QI project.  Pre and post 
electronic  surveys  of medical staff at the time of the simulation event as well as email 
surveys [ADDRESS_333713] data will be used to address research question 2.1  
 
ii. Process steps for identification of patients or records : 
Patient data: The study programmer (HP Institute RIIS programmer) will use the 
inclusion criteria specified earlier and used for the preliminary data counts to gather 
patient data on the expected [ADDRESS_333714] -simulation periods. The data pull 
for patient identification will occur at multiple times to accommodate data needs for 
specific research questions . A chart review (described below) will be conducted to 
gather additional morbidity data.  
 
iii. Process steps for data acquisition  
Patient data: The Institute programmer will work with clinical study staff to operationally 
define all study data elements and will use a programmatic data pull to obtain all data 
elements from Clarity that can be obtained using this method. A Redcap datab ase will 
be constructed by [CONTACT_273107] 640 patients, and will 
be used by [CONTACT_273108].  
 
Staff data: The s tudy team will receive a data file of staff survey responses collected as 
part of the QI project.  Surveys will be administered using REDCap  or on paper at the 
time of the simulation . Simulation center staff will send survey data to the Institute study 
team  via secure file transfer.  
 
d) Outcomes/endpoint and other variable definitions, and instruments used :  
A data source of “ EMR ” means that the data elements can be gathered by [CONTACT_273109] a programmatic data pull of Clarity (EMR) data. “Cha rt” means that the data 
[ADDRESS_333715]. However, th e listing of variables

Staff survey: The pre and post staff surveys are used for the QI project to assess staff 
perceptions of the required simulation training, and are included  as the end of the narrative as  
appendices. These surveys use items developed for this project  rather than existing tools. 
Surveys include a label to identify whether they are gathered before or after the simulation, and 
contain items such as confidence in handling second stage cesarean sections . 
 
f) Statistical analysis plan  
 
Descriptives (mean, s tandard deviation, proportion) and frequency distributions of all variables 
will computed and examined for distribution shape, outliers, missing data, and implausible data. 
Tables of descriptive statistics summarizing patients in both care systems (Regions , Methodist) 
9 
 will be created. Because there are only 2 primary outcomes (both of which are composite 
variables), there will be no control for multiple testing. Inferential analysis of secondary 
endpoints will be considered exploratory with the known limita tion that multiple testing could 
yield type 1 errors. Covariates in regression analysis will be specified a -priori on the basis of 
theory and when such covariates are unbalanced in comparison groups.  
 
Research question 1.1 : Does the simulation protocol de crease a composite variable of maternal 
morbidity defined as a) extension of uterine incision, b) operative blood loss > 1000 mL , c) 
requirement of transfusion, d) wound infection within 6 weeks, and d) endometritis within [ADDRESS_333716] 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]?  
 
Analytic sample: 480 maternal patients (120 Regions before/120 after simulation; [ADDRESS_333717] 
before/120 after simulation). Each sample of 120 is viewed as an independent sample.  
 
Analytic approach: Logistic regression will be used to predict the composite maternal morbidity 
endpoint  (0/1) from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Regions, Methodist), time (pre or post simulation), and their 
interaction. Covariates will be included if needed as described earlier. Model -based proportions, 
standard errors, and 95% CIs for each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273095], change over time, and 
differential change over time by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_273096]. A significant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] * time 
interaction and pattern of ef fects showing more improvement over time in Regions than 
Methodist will support the underlying hypothesis of differential improvement over time favoring 
Regions and potentially due to the effects of the simulation.  
 
Research question 1.2 : Does the simulati on protocol decrease a composite variable of infant  
morbidity defined as a) 5 minute APGARs <7, b) NICU admission, c) umbilical cord arterial pH 
<7.1, and d) fetal injury, at Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273097]?  
 
Analytic sample: 480 infant patients (120 Regions before/120 after simulation; [ADDRESS_333718] 
before/120 after simulation). Each sample of 120 is viewed as an independent sample.  
 
Analytic approach: Same as 1.1, but uses the endpoint of composite  infant morbidity  
 
Research question 2.1 : Does Regions hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273098]?  
 
Analytic sample: The [ADDRESS_333719] utilizing the required simulation training events.  
 
Analytic approach: Descriptive statistics (mean, proportion) and 95% CIs will be used to 
summarize staff survey items at each time point, and change from pre -simulation to immediately 
post-simulation, and pre -simulation to [ADDRESS_333720] -simulation. Plots over time of key survey 
items will illustrate staff reactions and perceptions ov er time. Simple paired -data analyses (e.g., 
paired t -tests, McNemar’s test) may be used to test change over time in key items or 
composites specified a -priori. Where possible, composites of multiple items will be summarized 
rather than individual items to reduce the number of comparisons and tests made.  
 
10 
 Research question 2. 2: Does implementation of the  simulation protocol decrease morbidity of 
other individual secondary outcomes (see variables table) during the second stage of labor at 
Regions Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273099]?  
 
Analytic sample: 480 infant/maternal patients (120 Regions before/120 after simulation; [ADDRESS_333721] before/120 after simulation). Each sample of 120 is viewed as an independent 
sample.   
 
Analytic approach: Same as 1.1, but dependent variables for these analyses will include the 
individual component items of the primary endpoints, and variables listed as “secondary 
endpoints” in the variable table. Due to the large number of tests conducted, these analyses will 
be viewed as m ore exploratory.  
 
Research question 2.4 : Is duration of second stage related to maternal and perinatal 
complications?  
 
Analytic sample: 640 infant/maternal patients at Regions and Methodist seen June 2015 -June 
2019.  
 
Analytic approach: Within each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Regions, Methodist), duration of second stage will be 
stratified (<1 hour, 1 -2 hrs, 2 -3 hrs, 3 -4 hrs, >4 hours). Individual maternal and infant endpoints 
in the variable table above will be summarized in terms of me an and proportion and 95% CIs 
within the strata. This analysis is considered descriptive and exploratory.  
 
g) Power analysis : Based  on recent literature (Laughton, 2014; Vousden 2014, Kawakita 2017), 
the estimate of the composite maternal endpoint for res earch question 1.1 ranges from 20% (if 
all elements of the composite are completely overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) to 40% (if all elements of the 
composite are independent and additive). Making the simplifying assumptions that Regions and 
Methodist have the same morbidity i n the pre -period, and that Methodist morbidity will not 
change from the pre to post -period, this study is powered at 80% (alphas=.05, 2 -sided) to detect 
a difference in the Methodist and Regions maternal morbidity composite of 20% (Methodist) vs. 
8% (Regio ns); 30% vs. 15%, or 40% vs. 23%, using a logistic regression model. Similar 
assumptions could be applied to the infant composite endpoints. For the staff survey, the study 
is powered to detect a change in a continuous survey item (e.g., staff confidence i n handling the 
procedure) from one time point to a later time point of 0.[ADDRESS_333722] deviation units for the 
sample of n=120 (pre to post simulation) and 0.[ADDRESS_333723] deviation units for the sample of 
n=96 (pre to [ADDRESS_333724] to 6 months).   
 
h) Str engths and limitations  
 
Strengths: Large N, broad availability of data elements, comparison group (Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
for more carefully assessing the effect of the QI project simulation training , enthusiastic buy -in 
by [CONTACT_142355]/GYN area in Regions, required QI project simulation training so all staff are exposed to 
simulation.  
 
Limitations: Lack of randomization, elements in chart might not be complete, two hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273100], unknown baseline level of primary endpoints.

6. Risks and Benefits  
There should not be risks to mother s, babies , and providers with this study.  There is min imal 
risk to conducting this study; it is a retrospective, data -only study.  
Benefits may include : 
Knowledge of whether simulation training improved maternal and perinatal outcomes in patients 
with deeply impacted fetal head at cesarean section, staff and provider teamwork , and staff and 
provider morale .  
 
7. Data Confidentiality and Privacy  
Data will b e stored on secure servers with limited access. Servers are in a physically secure 
location on campus and backed up nightly. Data will also be protected by [CONTACT_273110].  
Data will be kept separately from patient identifiers. Identifi ers will be destroyed at the earliest 
opportunity and data shared with the statistician will be completely de -identified.  
Patient identifiers will not be printed at any time during the study.

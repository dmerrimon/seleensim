Version 12 : 27 April 2021  6  1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:  
 
Patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are often overweight or obese. In order to 
obtain adequate glycemic control, many of these patients require intensive therapy with 
multiple  daily  injections  of insulin  (referred  to as MDI,  basal/bolus  regimen),  using  a rapid - 
acting/bolus insulin at each meal in combination with a once - or twice -daily long - 
acting/basal  insulin.  Unfortunately,  intensive  insulin  therapy  can result  in undesired  weight 
gain, which may, in part, result in further insulin resistance. In addition, w eight gain may 
adversely affect the control of comorbid health conditions (hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], 
congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, etc.). The burden of disease management with 
multiple daily injections of insulin also serves as a barrier to A1 C goal attainment as 
maintaining  compliance  with such complex  regimens  is often  challenging  in the real-world 
setting.  
 
Once patients with T2D require multiple daily injections of insulin to obtain glycemic 
control, it is generally considered to be a permanent/life -long therapy. However, reports 
have  demonstrated  the safety  and effectiveness  of adding  once -daily  glucagon -like peptide - 
[ADDRESS_1184254] (GLP -1RA) liraglutide to basal insulin therapy in order to obtain 
glycemic control (1, 2), and in clinical practice, the addition of liraglutide (or other FDA - 
approved GLP -1RAs) to basal insulin often negates or delays the need  to initiate prandial 
insulin. Subsequently, a newer form of anti -diabetic therapy, a once -daily injectable 
combination of GLP -1RA and basal insulin, became available and demonstrated promise 
that perhaps glycemic control may even be obtained with less complex regimens (i.e.,  less 
daily injections). There are currently two GLP -1RA/basal insulin combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_851764]: iGlarLixi (Soliqua®), and iDegLira (Xultophy®) (3, 4). While 
these observations with iGlarLixi and iDegLira demonstrating an improvement in A 1C 
while avoiding prandial insulin injections are very exciting, what remains unclear is if 
patients with r easonable glycemic control (A1C ≤ 7.5%) currently receiving MDI 
(basal/bolus, 3 -4 injections per day) could potentially maintain or even improve glycemic 
control by [CONTACT_667187] a once -daily injectable product like Xultophy® or Soliqua®. 
Currently, there a re no studies available (or planned) that have answered this clinical 
question.  One limitation  of these  combination  products  in the clinical  setting  is the inability 
to independently titrate the GLP -1RA and basal insulin components. If a patient begins to 
experience hypoglycemia, and/or their fasting BG values are currently within the goal 
range, the dose of these combination products cannot be further titrated, limiting one’s 
ability to further improve glycemic control in patients with a residual A1C  elevation.  
 
What also remains unclear is if some of the newer formulations of GLP -1RA may also be 
able to reduce  the burden  of disease  management  and maintain  glycemic  control  in patients 
who are currently  well-controlled  on a regimen  of MDI.  Recently,  subcutaneous  (sc) once - 
weekly semaglutide has been demonstrated to be capable of improving glycemic control in 
patients with T2D in combination with insulin therapy. In SUSTAIN -5 (5), at week 30, 
subcutaneous semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg was demonstrated to reduce A1C by 1.4 % and 
1.8%, respectively, vs 0.1% with placebo [mean baseline A1C value, 8.4%] in a population 
of T2D patients receiving stable therapy with basal insulin with or without metformin. 
Moreover, mean body weight (kg) decreased with semagluti de 0.5 and 1.0 mg vs placebo 
from baseline to end of treatment: 3.7, 6.4,  and 1.4 kg, respectively.  Premature  treatment  
discontinuation  due to adverse  events  was higher for semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg vs placebo 
Version 12 : 27 April 2021  7  (4.5%, 6.1%, and 0.8%), mainly due to gastrointestinal disorders. Even if the transition 
from MDI to once -daily sc semaglutide in combination with basal insulin were successful 
in only a minority of patients, the clinical advantage and reduction in burden of disease 
management that would be associated with transitioning from 3 -4 injections of insulin per 
day to a regimen of once - weekly sc semaglutide and a once -daily injection of basal insulin 
would be a rather dramatic and remarkable transformation for pa tients, and one that would 
likely improve patients’ diabetes treatment satisfaction. It would also help to solidify the 
effectiveness and safety of semaglutide in yet another population of patients with T2D. 
What cannot be  minimized is  the tremendous  impact  that a successful  transition  to once -
weekly  semaglutide  and once - daily basal insulin could have on patients in terms of 
reducing their insulin requirements, assisting with weight loss (or mitigating further weight 
gain), and reducing the frequency and b urden of hypoglycemia. In my clinical experience, 
once patients are titrated to full dose GLP -1RA therapy and attain adequate glycemic 
control, insulin doses (particularly prandial insulin) can often be further reduced or 
eliminated without negatively impacting glycemic control. Conti nuing the insulin therapy 
at higher doses in these patients simply suppresses the glucose -dependent secretion of 
endogenous insulin being promoted by [CONTACT_17978] -1RA  therapy.  Often,  only an abrupt  
cessation  of prandial  insulin,  or a step-wise down - titration of insulin therapy in these 
patients, will reveal that insulin therapy is no longer required at higher doses to maintain 
glycemic control. When this does successfully occur, the impact on patients is  
transformational.  
 
In a recent treat -to-target trial utilizing albiglutide  (6), patients with T2D and A1C ≥  7.0% 
to ≤ 9.5% receiving basal plus  prandial insulin (≤ 140 units total daily dose of insulin and 
≤ 70 units of prandial insulin per day) were  optimized over 4 weeks before participants 
were rand omized (1:1) to albiglutide +  optimized  basal insulin glargine and lispro (dose 
reduced by 50% at randomization; subsequently, lispro injections were fully discontinued 
4 weeks later) ( n=402) or to continued optimized lispro plus optimized glargine ( n=412).  
The mean ± SD A1C at baseline was 7.8% ± 0.6% in the albiglutide + glargine group and 
7.7% ± 0.6% in the lispro + glargine group.  The A1C was reduced at week 26 to 6.7 % ± 
0.8% and 6.6 % ± 0.8%, respectively (least squares [LS] difference 0.06% [95% CI 20.05 
to 0.17]; non -inferiority P < 0.0001).  In the albiglutide + glargine group, 218 participants 
(54%) replaced all prandial insulin without reintroducing lispro up to week 26. Total daily  
prandial insulin dose was similar at baseline but was lower by 62 units/day (95% CI -65.9 
to -57.8;  P<0.0001) at  week  26 in the albiglutide  + glargine group, and  the total number of 
weekly injections was also reduced from 29 to 13 per week.  Less severe/documented 
symptomatic hypoglycemia (57.2% vs. 75.0%) occurred in the  albiglutide  + glargine group 
with meaningful weight differences (LS  ± mean  SE -2.0 ± 0.2 vs. + 2.4 ± 0.2 kg; P < 
0.0001) vs. lispro + glargine. Gastrointestinal adverse  events were higher with albiglutide 
+ glargine (26% vs. 13%).  
 
The results obtained with the transition of uncontrolled patients with T2D receiving MDI 
with albiglutide are encouraging, but would likely have been more robust had a modern 
and more effect ive long -acting  GLP -1RA been utilized.   Unfortunately, 46% of the patients 
randomized to receive albiglutide had to resume prandial insulin prior to week [ADDRESS_1184255] likely been much higher ha d the patient’s  level of 
glycemic control been at target for a longer period of time  prior to the transition of the 
Version 12 : 27 April 2021  8  patient’s prandial insulin to GLP -1RA  (i.e., resolution of glucose toxicity) , and if a more 
potent and effi cacious GLP -1RA , such as once -weekly sc semaglutide,  were utilized.  
 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of once -weekly sc semaglutide (in 
combination with once -daily basal insulin) to maintain or improve glycemic control in 
patients currently receiving MDI, while providing the patients with a significan t reduction 
in the burden  of disease  management.  In addition,  this approach  may also furnish  a positive 
effect on weight management, a reduction in hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and improvement in 
diabetes treatment satisfaction, when substituted for basal/bolus therapy in patients with 
T2D who currently have adequate glycemic control (A1C ≤ 7.5%) with a regimen of  MDI 
(requiring  a total of ≤ 80 units  of insulin  per day).  The A1C  cut-point  of ≤ 7.5%  was chosen 
because  many  patients  on complex  treatment  regimens  (MDI)  with reasonable  control,  i.e., 
7-7.5%,  would  be expected  to have  a realistic  chance  of success  by [CONTACT_851769].  Also,  many  patients  taking  complex 
insulin regimens (MDI) fall in the close to A1C goal range of 7 -7.5%, so using this cut - 
point, vs. < 7%, would make recruitment easier. Lastly, patients receiving MDI who are 
older and/or with heart disease also have higher individual A1C goal/tar gets around  7.5%. 
This study will also assess the impact that a successful substitution may have on the 
patients’ diabetes treatment satisfaction, an important, yet under -appreciated aspect of 
diabetes  management.

insulin degludec to replace/negate the need for MDI (basal -bolus regimen) in patients 
with T2D under adequate glycemic control (A1C ≤ 7.5%) with MDI, while 
simultaneously providing the patients with a significant reduction in the burden of 
disease  management.

3. RESEARCH DESIGN AND  METHODS  
 
Study Hypothesis (hypotheses):  
Therapy  with once -weekly  sc semaglutide  in combination  with once -daily  insulin  degludec

Transitioning MDI to once -weekly sc semaglutide in combination with once -daily insulin 
degludec will be associated with weight loss, less blood glucose confirmed hypoglycemic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], as well as a reduction the frequency of severe hypoglycemic events, and  an 
improvement  in diabetes -treatment  satisfaction,  when  compared  to continued  therapy  with 
MDI.

Female subjects will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they become

semaglutide in combination with once -daily insulin degludec arm that become pregna nt 
must discontinue treatment. Following discontinuation of study treatment, subjects will 
be requested to maintain adherence to the study visits.  
3.[ADDRESS_1184264] a reasonable chance of being switched from MDI to once -daily 
sc semaglutide in combination with once -daily insulin degludec without a dramatic 
deterioration in glycemic control. Thus, a population of patients on MDI, with good 
glycemic control on their current regimen was chosen. Good glycemic control is defined 
here as ≤7.5% at baseline (screening). The rationale for selecting ≤  120 units/day of  
total insulin requirements as an eligibility criterion at baseline was as follows:  
 
  
• At week 26 in the study by [CONTACT_851771]  (6), the patients randomized to 
receive albiglutide + insulin glargine vs. insulin lispro + glargine were receiving 
9.8 ± 17.3 units of prandial insulin vs 71.9 ± 40.1 units, respectively, in addition 
to their basal insulin doses of 59.3 ± 24.1 and 58.6 ± 25.9 units, respectively.  
• The basal and bolus components yielded total daily insulin doses in the 
albiglutide + insulin glargine group of 69.0 ± 33.2 units and 130.4 ± 61.1 units in 
the insulin lispro + insulin glargine group.    
• The prandial insulin dose at week 26 was lower by 62 units/day in the 
albiglutide + insulin glargine group.   
• Thus, one would expect a group of well -controlled patients receiving MDI, ≤ 
120 units of insulin per day , could be controlled on a basal insulin dose on the 
order of 0.5 units/kg  (a physiologic approach) , and prandial dose ≤ 0.5 
unit/kg/day, plus a highly effective GLP -1RA that could substitute/ replace 62 or 
more units of prandial insulin while maintaining glycemic control.  
• Allowing higher doses of insulin, up to 140 units/day, and up to 70 units of 
Version 12 : 27 April 2021  13  prandial insulin per day , as was allowed by [CONTACT_851771], may result in a 
failure rate on the order of 50%, as noted in their study where ~50% of patients 
in the albiglutide arm had to resume some prandial insulin prior to week 26.   
• As the primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the ability to maintain 
good glycemic control via switch to sc semaglutide and insulin degludec vs. 
continuing a regimen of MDI, while reducing the patient’s burden of diabetes 
management , a more conservative approach is necessary to avoid the need to 
resume prandial insulin in many of the study subjects prior to week 26.

window of +/ - [ADDRESS_1184266] the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Potentially eligible subjects will be contact[CONTACT_851772]. 
The screening encounter may occur during a routine visit with their provider or subj ects 
may be contact[CONTACT_5143]. If subjects agree to voluntarily participate, signed 
informed consent will be obtained.  
 
Physical examination will be performed by [CONTACT_1704]. Gender, age, ethnicity, 
blood pressure, pulse, height, weight, BMI, total daily insulin dose ( total, basal  and bolus  
components , both in daily units, and as units/kg/day for each component ), metformin 
therapy status, SGLT -[ADDRESS_1184267]’s self -reported duration of

Blood samples will be collected to obtain the following laboratory values: HbA1C, GAD - 
65, serum creatinine and AST/ALT. GAD -[ADDRESS_1184268] of care therapy.  
 
3.10.2  Randomization Visit  
The randomization visit will occur within 3 weeks of the screening visit.  
 
Weight, BMI, blood pressure, pulse, and total daily insulin dose (basal and bolus) will be 
collected. The study  investigator will review screening labs and confirm eligibility of each 
subject before randomization.  
 
To assess the impact that a successful substitution may have on a subject’s diabetes 
treatment satisfaction, the subject will complete the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire Status Version (DTSQs).  
 
Eligible subjects will be randomized 2:1 to either switch to once -weekly sc semaglutide 
in combination with once -daily insulin degludec or continue MDI. Block 
randomization will occur to ensure equal distribution of patients between arms that are 
receiving <80 units of insulin per day and betwee n 80-120 units of insulin per day. 
Version 12 : [ADDRESS_1184269] insulin aspart and their basal insulin 
switched to once -daily insulin degludec (both provided by [CONTACT_1758]). This will allow 
for treatment uniformity, and to avoid gaps in treatment that often occur in the real - 
world setting (secondary to insurance copays, deductibles, donut -hold coverage gaps in 
Medicare patients, etc.). Patients randomized to MDI will be allowed to continue 
correc tion rapid -acting insulin, in addition to their prandial doses of rapid -acting 
insulin, throughout the duration of the study.  
 
In patients randomized to MDI, basal insulin will be adjusted to 0.5 units/kg/day (if their 
pre-trial daily dose of basal insulin is >0.5 units/kg/day, otherwise, if it is ≤ 0.5 
units/kg/day, their current dose will be continued), and the dose of basal ins ulin will 
continue to be titrated to obtain fasting glucose levels of 70 -90 mg/dL as outlined in the 
table below.  
 
 
Their existing doses of prandial insulin, and number of injections, will be continued. Pre - 
meal glucose values of < 130 mg/dL will be targeted, in accordance with the 
recommendations outlined in the ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes -2020 
Position  Statement  (7). Prandial  insulin  doses  will be increased  by 2 unit increments  every 
three days (using lowest pre -meal glucose value over the preceding three day period)  until 
goal attainment is reached. For example, if the pre -lunch glucose values are consi stently 
above range (> 130 mg/dL), the breakfast dose of prandial/rapid -acting insulin will be 
increased by 2 units. The lower limit for pre -prandial blood glucose will be 70 mg/dL. If  a 
patient’s lowest pre -meal glucose value over the preceding three days is < 70 mg/dL, the 
prandial insulin dose will be lowered by 2 units. For example, if the pre -lunch glucose 
value is < 70 mg/dL, the breakfast dose of prandial/rapid -acting insulin will  be decreased 
by 2 units. See below  table . 
 
 
Patients will be asked to check their blood sugar four times daily via point -of-care (POC) 
measures at meals (AC: pre -breakfast, pre -lunch, pre -dinner) and bedtime (HS). These 
values  will be used to adjust  their insulin  regimen,  guide  dosing  of corrective  insulin  aspart 
and monitor the degree of glycemic control between physician encounters and lab 
assessments.  

Version 12 : 27 April 2021  15   
 
If hypoglycemia is noted to occur the daily basal insulin degludec dose and total daily 
insulin aspart dose will both be reduced by 10% by [CONTACT_093].  
 
The patients randomized to once -weekly sc semaglutide in combination with once -daily 
insulin degludec will start at 0.25 mg of sc semaglutide and adjustment of their dose of 
basal insulin to 0.5 units/kg/day of basal insulin degludec (if their pre -trial da ily dose of 
basal insulin is >0.5 units/kg/day, otherwise, if it is ≤ 0.5 units/kg/day, their current dose 
will be continued). Their doses of prandial insulin therapy will be stopped. The dose of 
insulin degludec will be administered once -daily at bedtime,  and the dose of once -weekly 
sc semaglutide will be administered on a weekly day of choice determined by [CONTACT_102]. 
Participants  assigned  to 0.25 mg once -weekly  sc semaglutide  will undergo  dose escalation 
to 0.5 mg at 4 weeks  and to the maintenance  dose of 1 mg at 8 weeks.  The insulin  degludec 
dose will remain stable until the patients reach their maximum tolerated dose of sc 
semaglutide. If hypoglycemia is noted to occur during this period, the daily basal insulin 
degludec dose will be reduced by 10% by [CONTACT_093]. Subsequently, after week 8 -12 
(depending on when the patients reach their maximum tolerated dose of once weekly sc 
semaglut ide), the lowest fasting blood glucose value over the preceding three day period 
will be used for insulin degludec titration purposes. The target fasting plasma glucose will 
be 70 -90 mg/dL. Patients will be instructed on how to self -titrate the insulin deg ludec and 
will follow the same basal insulin titration algorithm described  above.  
 
3.10.3  Semaglutide Dose Titration in Setting of Intolerability/Side Effects  
If a subject does not tolerate (and is unwilling to continue) the 0.[ADDRESS_1184270] is tolerating the 0.25 mg weekly dose at th e time of the week 8 
study visit, their dose will be increased to 0.5 mg weekly.  If they are tolerating the 0.5 mg 
weekly dose at week 12 study visit, the patient would then continue that dose of sc 
semaglutide and initiate insulin degludec titration.  Fu rther dose escalation of the sc 
semaglutide to 1.0 mg at the week 12 study visit will not be attempted.   
 
If the patient reports not tolerating the 0.5 mg dose (at any point in time after the reattempt 
to increase the dose at the week 8 visit) the subject will be instructed to resume 0.[ADDRESS_1184271] does not tolerate the sc semaglutide dose increase from 0.5 to 1.0 mg, initiated 

Version 12 : 27 April 2021  16  at the week 8 study visit, they will be placed back on 0.5 mg weekly and the titration of 
insulin degludec will commence at that point in time (rather than waiting until week 12 
study visit).  
 
At the 12 week  follow -up appointment/assessment,  the number  of daily  POC  blood  glucose 
assessments will be reduced to 1 -2 daily measures, per the discretion of the investigator. 
Additional  POC  assessments  may be requested  if the investigator  feels  they are warranted.  
 
The group of patients randomized to sc semaglutide in combination with once -daily basal 
insulin will be allowed to continue correction rapid -acting insulin as described in the  table 
above up until the time of their 12 week follow -up appointment/assessment, or until 
achieving their maximum tolerated dose of sc semaglutide, whichever comes first, to help 
address uncontrolled post -prandial hyperglycemia until the dose of sc semaglu tide can be 
adequately titrated and  maintained.  
 
A failure of once -weekly sc semaglutide in combination with once -daily insulin degludec 
will be defined as a mean daily glucose level consistently > 180 mg/dL despi[INVESTIGATOR_851766] -daily insulin deglu dec 
at a dose greater than 1 unit/kg/day or per the discretion of the investigator. At this  point,  
the patients  will continue semaglutide but resume prandial insulin for  the remaining  duration  
of study  and titrate according  to protocol .

6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  
 
6.1 Sample Size  Calculation  
  
We plan to randomize patients 2:[ADDRESS_1184278] glycemic control rate is unknown, calculations we re performed 
based on data from Rosenstock et al (2020) where 60% of patients achieved HbA1c 
levels below 7.0% and an estimated 85% achieved levels below 7.5% (under the 
assumption that HbA1c levels were normally distributed).  Based on these assumptions 
and use of a two -sided 95% confidence interval, with 60 patients randomized 2:1, the 
difference in control rates will be able to be estimated to within ± 19% (for pooled 
control rate of 85%) to 26% (with pooled control rate of 60%). With this sample size, t he 
control rate with sc semaglutide in combination with basal insulin can be estimated to 
within ±11% to ±15% under the same assumptions for glycemic control rate as above.  
We feel that the gains in precision seen with extra enrollment  (>60)  do not justif y the 
extra resources re quired to obtain these numbers.

60% control rate  0.20 0.21 0.24 0.26 0.30 
 
 
Although identification of risk factors for control with sc semaglutide and once -daily 
basal insulin is an exploratory aim, with this sample size, univariable analyses can be 
performed that will allow for identification of patient characteristics that are associated 
with HbA1c control with sc semaglutide and basal insulin and may warrant future study.   
 
6.2 Statistical  Methods  
The primary analysis will be performed using the intent -to-treat cohort. Given the early 
stage of this research, per -protocol analyses among those continuing therapy will also be 
performed to assess efficacy among those who tolerate the therapy. This will help to 
Version 12 : [ADDRESS_1184279].  For the primary  outcome,  control  rates  will 
be calculated  as proportions,  and the difference  in control  rates  with 95% confidence  limits 
will be estimated. Categorical variables, including the frequency and severity of 
hypoglycemia, will be compared between groups using Poisson regression models, chi - 
square tests or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Relative rates and odds ratios with 95% 
confidence limits will be presented as appropriate. Changes in continuous measures 
between initial and follow -up assessments will be compared using analysis of cova riance 
models that include baseline levels of these variables as a covariate. Results will be 
presented as mean levels with 95% confidence limits. If necessary, transformations of 
continuous measures will be performed prior to analysis to meet assumptions of the models. 
The primary endpoint, and all secondary endpoints will be tested assuming an overall 0.[ADDRESS_1184280] visit will be classified as fai lure to control, however assessment  of 
missing  data patterns  will be performed  regardless.  Frequency  tables  will be provided to 
identify the reason for control failure (e.g. side effect, lack of efficacy, etc.). Exploratory 
analyses will also be performed to measure the association between patient characteristics 
and glycemic control overall, within assigned groups, and within per protocol groups using 
Pearson chi -square and t -tests to better understand efficacy within the population.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1184281]  KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]:  
 
A file database will be created for data collection accessible only by [CONTACT_443801].  Information  will be entered  into the database  as it is collected  and patients  finish

• Death  
• A life -threatening*  experience  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_349750]  
• A persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening*, or  require  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical 
judgement, they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
• Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_349752]  
*The term life -threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  
 
12.1.4  Serious Adverse Drug Reaction  (SADR):  
Version 12 : 27 April 2021  25  An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event (AE) for which a causal relationship 
to the trial product is at least possible i.e. causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be 
dismissed. Serious adverse reaction (SAR): Adverse event which fulfils b oth the criteria 
for a Serious Adverse Event and the criteria for an Adverse Reaction.  
 
12.1.5  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R):  
An SAE which is unexpected and regarded as possibly or probably related to the 
trial/study product by [CONTACT_093]. The current approved summary of 
product characteristics (package insert) for Ozempic® will be used for 
assessment of expectedness.  
 
12.1.[ADDRESS_1184285] (MESI): A MESI is (1) a medication  error 
(e.g. wrong drug administration or wrong route of administration) or (2) a suspected 
transmission of an infectious agent via the  product

A non -serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE.  
 
12.1.8  Severity Assessment  Definitions:  
• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily  activities  
• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily  activities  
• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities,  unacceptable  
 
12.1.9  Relationship to study medication Assessment  Definitions:  
• Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal  relationship  
• Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be  dismissed  
• Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial  product  
 
12.1.10  Outcome Categories and Definitions:  
• Recovered: Fully recovered or by [CONTACT_851778]  
• Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from  the 
event. This term should only be used when the subject has completed the  trial 
• Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and 
significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE  recovered 
with sequelae should be rated as an  SAE  
• Not recovered  
• Fatal  
• Unknown

1 OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objective  
To determine the incidence of neutrophil engraftment in Fanconi A nemia  patients with high 
risk disease treated with busulfan (BU), cyclophosphamide (CY), fludarabine (FLU) and 
antithymocyte globulin (ATG) followed by [CONTACT_59513].  
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
To evaluate:  
• incidence of acute and chronic graft -versus- host disease (GVHD)  
• incidence of relapse in patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBt) or acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML)  
• incidence of major infections (gram negative infections, probable or proven fungal infections) in patients with history of major infections  
• incidence of regimen -related tox icity (RRT)  based on transplant outcomes 
• tolerability of mycofenolate mofetil (MMF)  
• probability of one year survival 
  
2 STUDY DESIGN 
 
This is a single center study to evaluate the safety, and incidence of neutrophil engraftment in high risk F anconi anemia patients transplanted with related or unrelated CD34+ selected cells  after a 
cytoreductive preparative regimen consisting of busulfan, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) . Effective with November 1, 2016 protocol , subjects  receiving CD34+ 
selected cells  will co enroll on MT2015-[ADDRESS_219995] identified a safe and effective regimen that reproducibly allows for primary engraftment with low risk of regimen related toxicity (RRT) a nd graft -versus- host disease (GVHD).  New 
data suggest that the success of transplantation is dependent upon the clinical status of the patient at the time of HSCT.
[ADDRESS_219996]: Review of the Literature  
For the IBMTR, Gluckman et al. (1995) analyzed the outcome of [ADDRESS_219997] for FA from HLA -identical siblings (n=151), mismatched family member donors 
(n=29) or unrelated donors (n=19).
2  Age at transplant ranged from 1 to 39 years (median 10 
years) for HLA -identical sibling recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 4 to 31 years (median 9 years) for non- HLA 
identical sibling donor recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  A variety of preparative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], GVHD prophylaxis and 
MT2002- 02:  HSCT in high risk Fanconi Anemia     
    
September 4, 2019  Page 6 of 30 CPRC # 2002LS014 supportive care strategies were utilized.  For recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -identical sibling HSCT, two 
year probability of myeloid engraftment was 92%.  Estimated probabilities of grade II- IV 
acute GVHD at day 100 was 42% and of chronic GVHD at 2 years 44%.  Estimated 
probability of survival at 2 years was 66%.  In multivariate analysis, improved engraftment rates were observed with age of HSCT ≤10 years, conditioning including ATG, and higher platelet count before transplant.  In multivariate analysis, decreased mortality was observed with younger age, use of ATG in the conditioning regimen, conditioning with LFI and low-dose CY versus ≥100 mg/kg CY and no irradiation, and the use of cyclosporin with or without methotrexate for  GVHD prophylaxis.  Patients who received marrow from alternate donors 
(i.e. donors other than HLA-identical sibling donors) had worse outcomes.  Myeloid engraftment was observed in only 76% of patients and grade II- IV acute GVHD occurred in 
51%.  The probability of survival was 29% after alternative donor transplantation.  More recently, the results of a retrospective multicenter study of [ADDRESS_219998] was 10.8 years (range 4. 0 to 37.4 
years).  Eleven patients (16%) had features of MDS (n = 8) or AML (n = 3) prior to HSCT.  Preparative therapy consisted of low dose CY, total body irradiation (TBI) ± ATG in 56% patients, low dose CY, thoracoabdominal irradiation (TAI) ± ATG in 41% patients and chemotherapy ± ATG in 3% patients.  The probability of achieving neutrophil recovery by [CONTACT_4475] 30 was 83%.  In multivariate analysis, higher probability of achieving neutrophil recovery was associated with younger age (<10 years), a pretransplant elevation of serum alanine/aspartate transaminases (ALT/AST) >2x upper limit of normal, the use of a male donor, and absence of 3- lineage cytopenia before initiation of preparative therapy.  Primary 
graft failure occurred more frequently when female do nors were used, mainly due to lower 
nucleated cell doses compared to grafts from male donors.   The probability of severe (grade III-IV) acute GVHD was 34%.  Elevated serum ALT/AST before HSCT, limb, urogenital 
tract or nephrologic malformations, and non-T cell depleted grafts were predictive or severe GVHD.  Three year probability of survival was 33%.   Among the [ADDRESS_219999] follow -up giving a 3 year estimated survival of 
14%.  In multivariate analysis, extensive congenital malformations, positive cytomegalovirus serology, the use of androgens before HSCT, and female donors were associated with a worse outcome.   In 2012, arm [ADDRESS_220000] at the University of Minnesota  
3.3.1 Results with CY -TBI-ATG  
At the University of Minnesota, between June 1993 and July 1998, 29 FA patients were treated with cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg, total body irradiation (TBI) 450 cGy or 600 cGy and anti -thymocyte globulin  (ATG) followed by [CONTACT_186197] a non -HLA identical 
sibling donor HSCT.
4  GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A (CSA) for 6 
months, short course methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/d) between day +5 and +19 and TCD by [CONTACT_186198][INVESTIGATOR_840].  For the entire cohort, the probability of neutrophil recovery was 61% (95%CI 43-79%). In univariate analysis,

7 nucleated cells/kg, p = .05).  Of 25 patients evaluable for myeloid engraftment, 3 of 13 
patients without T cell somatic mosaicism (< median of 10% DEB insensitive cells) failed to engraft while 7 of 12 patients with T cell somatic mosaicism (>median of 10% DEB insensitive cells) exp erienced primary graft failure.  Probabilities of neutrophil recovery 
for patients with and without somatic mosaicism were 42% (95% CI 14-70%) and 83% (95% CI 61-100%), respectively (p = .05).   Probability of grade III- IV acute GVHD was 
28% (95%CI 8- 48%).   The probability of survival at 1 year was 34% (95% CI 17- 51%).  
Kaplan -Meier estimate of 1 year survival for the entire cohort of 29 patients was 34% 
(95%CI 17-51%).  One year survival in the TBI 450 cGy, TBI 450 cGy with ATG, and 600 cGy with ATG groups, were 43% (95%CI 17-69%), 43% (95%CI 6 - 80%), and 13% (95%CI 0 -35%), respectively (p = NS).
[ADDRESS_220001] for patients with FA was graft failure.  To potentially improve engraftment r ate we chose a relatively new immunosuppressive agent, 
fludarabine (FLU) 5-8 to add to the  commonly used preparative regimen of 
cyclophosphamide (CY, 40 mg/kg), total body irradiation (TBI, 450 cGy) and ATG (150 mg/kg).  Between April 1999 and November 2001, 27 patients with FA (AA [n=17], RAEB [n=6], RAEBt [n=4]) underwent T cell depleted bone marrow (n=19) or umbilical cord blood transplantation (n=6) from alternate donors (ie. non- HLA -matched sibling 
donors).  Primary neutrophil engraftment was achieved in 25/25 evaluable patients including 9 patients with somatic mosaicism, a potential risk factor for GF.  This outcome 
was of particular significance since the same CY/TBI/ATG regimen but without FLU resulted in only a 63% (95% CI, 42-82%) incidence of engraftment (p<0.01).  Notably, secondary GF occurred in [ADDRESS_220002], none developed severe (grade 3 -4) acute GVHD.  Chronic GVHD has been observed in 2 patients thus far.  With 
a med ian follow up of 14 months, the probability of survival at 1 year is 46%.   
 In a recent analysis
1, we stratified the patients on the basis of disease status, a known risk 
factor that impacts survival in FA patients undergoing HCST.2, 3  Patients were considered 
high risk if they had advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, i.e. refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB] or refractory anemia with exces s blasts in transformation

of survival ((86%, 95% CI 67-100%).  In contrast, as shown in the figure below, patients with high risk disease (n = 9) had a significantly lower survival (13%, 95% CI 0-36%, p<0.01). 
 
Therefore, we elected to terminate enrollment of high risk patients onto the FLU -CY-TBI-
ATG regimen and develop a novel treatment regimen for high risk patients in an attempt to improve survival without compromising engraftment.  Standard risk patients which have done exceptionally well, will continue to receive the FLU- CY-TBI-ATG regimen as 
detailed in protocol MT 1999-05.

Furthermore, it may eliminate the need for TBI which is toxic to FA patients potentially increasing their risk of infection (i.e., by [CONTACT_186199]).  While the use of TBI is standard of care for patients with FA undergoing HSCT, TBI may play a role in the increased risk for the develo pment of late 
malignancies.  If engraftment can be achieved with busulfan without increased toxicity, this therapy may be applicable to standard risk patients in the future in an attempt to decrease the risk of late effects (malignancy, sterility and endocrinopathies). 
 
3.4.1 Busulfan Mechanism of Action 
Busulfan (BU) is an alkylating agent with profound myeloablative and anti- leukemic 
properties.  It is frequently used in preparative regimens prior to HSCT as a irradiation sparing agent.
9-[ADDRESS_220004] been shown to be quite variable, 
presumably due to marked differences in absorption and/or clearance.12  In addition, there 
is some suggestion that increased plasma levels may relate to enhanced toxicity, while inadequate levels may be associated with graft failure.
13  The recent availability of an 
intravenous form of the drug may result in decreased variation of the pharmacokinetics of the drug.
14  The drug has been tested in children using a dose of 0.8 mg/kg; however, it 
was determined that in children less than 4 years of age the clearance was mor e rapid and 
in this population a dose of 1.0 mg/kg will be used.[ADDRESS_220005] experienced durable engraftment and favorable 
outcome with tolerable amounts of regimen related toxicity.

5.2 Immunosuppressive Ther api[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
 
5.2.1 Graft Failure Prophylaxis  
Methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day intravenously every 24 hours will be given on days -
5, -4, -3, -2 and –1, immediately prior to the infusion of antithymocyte globulin  
(ATGAM) . 
 
Antithymocyte globulin  (ATGAM) 30 mg/kg every 24 hours will be administered 
after each dose of methylprednisolone on days -5, -4, -3, -2 and - 1.  Antithymocyte 
globulin will be diluted in sterile normal saline or half normal saline for intravenous 
infusion to a concentration of 1- 2 mg/mL and will be inf used through the Hickman 
catheter over 4 -6 hours.  In the event of a significant reaction to antithymocyte 
globulin (ATGAM) , further doses of the agent will not be administered.

September 4, 2019  Page 16 of 30 CPRC # 2002LS014 the peripheral blood and bone marrow will be performed.  When appropriate, molecular or 
cytogenetic diagnostic tests will also be performed to detect residual or recurrent disease.  
 
7.8 Immune Reconstitution  
Patients should be considered for the University Of Minnesota protocol MT2009-22R - Monitoring of Immune Function and Minimal Residual Disease in Patients and Donors After Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT).  
  
8 ADVERSE EVENT  MONITORING AND REPORTING  
Toxicity and adverse events will be classified according to NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE). A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP home page:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40   
8.1 Definitions  
The following definitions are based on the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Part 312.32 (21CFR312.32(a)).    Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not cons idered drug related.  
 Suspected Adverse Reaction:   Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event.   Life-Threatening Adverse Event Or Life- Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction:  An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.    Serious Adverse Event Or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction:   An a dverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  • Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

September 4, 2019  Page 17 of 30 CPRC # 2002LS014 Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction : An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the protocol- related 
documents (e.g. protocol, consent documents, investigator brochure , package insert)  or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed  or given the characteristics of the 
subject population being studied  
 Attribution : is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the 
study dru g. Attribution is assigned as follows: • Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study drug  
• Probable – the AE is likely related to the study drug • Possible – t he AE may be related to the study drug  
• Unlikely – the AE is doubtfully related to the study drug • Unrelated – the AE is clearly not related to the study drug  
Attribution must be assigned by [CONTACT_137247].  
 The following definitions ar e from the Masonic Cancer Center’s Standard Operating 
Procedure (SOP) Deviation Reporting:   Major Deviation : A deviation or violation that impacts the risks and benefits of the research; 
may impact subject safety, affect the integrity of research data and /or affect a subject’s 
willingness to participate in the research. Deviations that place a subject at risk, but do not result in harm are considered to be major deviations.  
 Minor Deviation : A deviation or violation that does not impact subject safety, compromise 
the integrity of research data and/or affect a subject’s willingness to participate in the research.  
 Expedited (Rapid) Reporting : Certain events may require rapid notification to entities 
providing patient safety oversight (e.g. IRB) as detailed in section 8.2.  For the IRB this is 5 working days.   
 
FOR CD34+ SELECTED CELLS ONLY: Any clinically significant safety issues associated with cell processing failure or device malfunction regarding the CliniMACS® system must be  
reported  to the PI ([CONTACT_186207] MacMillan) and Miltenyi ([EMAIL_3648]) per 
institutional procedures under protocol MT2015-31.   FOR UNLICENSED UCB UNITS ONLY:  These p atients will be co -enrolled on 
University of Minnesota protocol MT2011-13R.  Selected expected adverse reactions  
determined to be caused by [CONTACT_186202]-[ZIP_CODE] (C. Brunstein, MD, PhD – sponsor/investigator). Included are the following: 
• The unit is mislabeled or failure to pass local lot release  
• Serious infusion reaction within first 24 hours after infusion

The SAE Coordinator will provide the Masonic Cancer Center’s Data and Safety Monitoring Council (DSMC) with the SAE in an appropriate format depending on the individual SAE (as reported or in a summary format).  
   
9 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
The study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be in compliance with the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center's Data & Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), which can be accessed at  http://z.umn.edu/dmsp   For the purposes of data and safety monitoring, this study is classified as moderate risk. Therefore the 
following requirements will be fulfilled:  
• The Masonic Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Council (DSMC) will review the trial’s progress twice yearly  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_186187]. 
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_186188] 8.3 to the Masonic Cancer Center’s SAE Coordinator, the University of 
Minnesota IRB, and the FDA.   
 In addition, at the time of the continuing review with the University of Minnesota IRB, a copy of the report with any attachments will be submitte d to the Cancer Protocol Review Committee (CPRC). 
   
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
It is anticipated that we  will enroll a total of 25 patients.  Patients will be stratified on the basis of 
donor type (HLA genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_186189]).  
10.1 Objectives  
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the probability of engraftment.  The incidence of GVHD, relapse, major infections, transplant-related mortality (at day 100) and cumulative proportion surviving at 1 year will also be evaluated.  The plan is to enroll a maximum of 25 patients in a single arm study.  
 
10.2 Statistical Analysis  
There will be continuous monitoring of graft failure.  The goal is that graft failure (day 30) be 
<10% with an upper limit of 25%.  Analysis of secondary objectives will consider the incidence of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, opportunistic infections, relapse (to MDS or AML), and cumulative proportion surviving at 1 year.  These will be estimated using cumulative incidence

event, respectively for the two methods.  Confidence levels of 90% will be used because of 
the small number of available patients.  
 
10.3 Toxicity Monitoring and Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_186190] a type I error rate of 10% to increase the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_186191].  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_186192] (H

P=0.10 vs. H 1 P=0.25): stop for [ADDRESS_220017] 2 patients, 4 of 8 or 5 of 25.  This 
has a type I error rate of 10% if the actual rate is 0.10 and a power of 79% to detect a rate as high as 0.25 a t an average sample size of 17.5 patients.  If the actual graft failure rate were 
only 0.20, the power is lowered to 59%.  Because graft failure is likely to be more of a problem for those with unrelated donors, the same stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_186193].  The smaller sample size and problems with multiple testing are ignored.

The monitoring boundary will be set up based on an overall goal of terminating the study if more than 38% of patients have treatment related mortality by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_220018] transplant.  The monitoring boundary for this study is:  
4/4 death, 5/5, 6/7, 7/10, 8/13, 9/25  This boundary has a type I error rate of .10 if the true event rate is approximately 25% and a power of 0.65 for a rate of 38%

11 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
While there will be every effort to seek out and include women and minority patients, the 
patient population is dependent upon the referral pattern and the ability to locate a suitable unrelated marrow donor.  Women and minority patients are eligible for all aspects of the study and their participation will be actively encouraged.  It is recognized that certain minority groups are less likely to find suitably compatible unrelated BM donors through the NMDP registry.  Formal efforts to increase minority donor recruitment are being made by [CONTACT_186204].  All minority patients with suitable unrelated BM donors will be actively encouraged to enroll in 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
11.2 Monitoring  
The sponsor- investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_5040], government regulatory bodies, and University of Minnesota compliance groups in addition to the monitoring requirements of the Cancer Center’s Data and Safety Monitoring

September 4, 2019  Page 21 of 30 CPRC # 2002LS014 Plan (section 9).  The investigator will make available all study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, stud y data, etc.).  The 
investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study- related facilities 
(e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.) will be available for trial related monitoring, audits, or regulatory inspections.

the rights, safety and well-being of the patients.  The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB approval has been obtained.  The protocol, informed consent, written information given to the patients, safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB by [CONTACT_32595]. 
   
11.5 Informed Consent  
All potential study participants will be given a copy of the IRB -approved consent document to 
review. The investigator or designee will explain all aspects of the study in lay language and 
answer all questions regarding the study. If the participant decides to participate in the study, he/she will be asked to sign and date the consent document. Patients who refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study will be treated without prejudice.

•  Each  column identifies minimum criteria for organ grade.   
•  Each grade is based on maximum stage for each individual organ involved  
e.g. Grade II = skin stage 3 and/or liver stage 1 and/or gut stage 1 and/or UGI stage 1  
 
Chronic GVHD:  
Limited CGVHD  
Localized  skin involvement (<50% body surface area) 
 and/or 
Limited hepatic involvement (abnormal LFTS; bilirubin < 3 mg/dl)  
 
Extensive CGVHD  
The presence of one or more of the following criteria may be used for the diagnosis of extensive 
CGVHD: 
• Generalized skin involvement ( ≥ 50% body surface area)  
• Liver histology consistent with involvement by [CONTACT_186205] ≥ 3 mg/dl 
• Positive Schirmer’s test (< 5 mm wetting)  
• Histologically -proven involvement by [CONTACT_186206] 
• Lung dysfunction with bronchiolitis obliterans with no evidence of viral causation on histology.  
• Gastrointestinal involvement: malabsorption and/or weight loss due to anorexia without explanation other than CGVHD.

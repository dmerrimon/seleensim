Hypothesis: 
Phase  1b: The combination  of atezolizumab  and entinostat  at a biologically  active  dose will be sufficiently 
safe and well tolerated to warrant further investigation.  
Phase 2: Entinostat  at the dose determined in Phase  1b combined with  atezolizumab will result  in an 
improved progression free survival compared to atezolizumab alone.  
Study  Design : 
This is a Phase 1b/2 study evaluating the combination of entinostat plus atezolizumab in patients with 
aTNBC. The study has 2 phases:  an open- label Dose Determination Phase (Phase 1b) followed by [CONTACT_893926] (Phase 2). The Expansion Phase will evaluate the efficacy and safety of entinostat when administered at  the RP2D  with atezolizumab in patients  with aTNBC  in a randomized,  double- blind, 
placebo- controlled setting.  Following the enrollment and completion of Cycle [ADDRESS_1252417].  Up to 88 evaluable patients are anticipated if the study completes all phases of evaluation (up to 
18 patients for Phase 1b,  up to 70 patients for Phase 2). Up to 50 international study centers may 
participate.  
Regardless of phase, patients will be screened for study eligibility within 21 days before enrollment into the study.  Patients  who are determined to be eligible  based on screening assessments  will be enrolled  in 
the study within 3 business days of starting study treatment Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1).  
A treatment  cycle  is 3 weeks  (21 days)  in length.  The dose of atezolizumab will be fixed  at 1200 mg IV 
q 3 weeks (day 1 of each cycle) for all patients. Entinostat (during the Phase 1b Dose Determination  
Phase)  and e
 ntinostat  / placebo (during Phase 2,  Expansion Phase)  will be administered orally  on days  1, 
8 and 15 of each 21 day  cycle. The Dose Determination Phase will begin with a starting dose (dose level 
1) of entinostat 5 mg po weekly.  If dose level 1 exceeds the MTD, then entinostat 3 mg po weekly (dose 
level -1) will be investigated. If dose level - 1 exceeds the MTD, then entinostat 2 mg po weekly (dose 
level -2) will be investigated.  Dosing is  planned  to be continuous  unless  interrupted for management  of an 
adverse event.  The entinostat dose determined appropriate for combination with atezolizumab will then 
be taken forward into the Phase [ADDRESS_1252418] study  evaluations  performed on C1D1, 
C1D8,  and C1D15;  D1 and D15 of C2; and on  D1 of each cycle  thereafter.  Patients  will have radiological 
disease assessments performed within [ADDRESS_1252419] dose of study drug, and then every 6 weeks  (+/-3 days)  through week  36 (Weeks  6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36) until unequivocal  progressive disease. 
Patients  remaining  on study  after week  36 will undergo radiological disease assessments  every  9 weeks 
(+/- 3 days) until unequivocal progressive disease occurs. Disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_33456] (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scans, as appropriate using the same 
method as used for the screening evaluation, and response will be assessed by [CONTACT_226860] 1.1.

 Safety will be assessed during the study by [CONTACT_893927] (US) National 
Cancer  Institute  (NCI) Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events  (CTCAE),  version 4.03,  clinical 
laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Adverse events of special interest 
(AESI) will be collected and reviewed in a manner consistent with serious adverse event reporting procedures.  
Fresh  tumor  tissue  core biopsy  samples  will be collected during  the study  as follows:  
• During  screening  from all patients  on a mandatory  basis.  Archival  biopsies  when available  will 
also be collected for comparison.  
• On C
2D15 (+3 days)  on an optional  basis  from patients  in the Dose  Determination Phase.  All 
patients will be encouraged to provide an optional biopsy in order to help understand dose- 
immune correlate effects.  
• On C2D15 (+ 3 days)  on a mandatory  basis  until 20 samples  are obtained in  the Phase 2 portion 
and on an optional basis for subsequent patients in this phase 2 expansion.  
• At the end  of study  treatment  prior to the start of another  systemic therapy,  on an optional  basis.  
• At the time of disease progression on an optional  basis.  
• If, based on an interim review of tumor tissue data from the initial patients in the Phase 2 portion 
such data are considered informative, then tumor tissue samples may be collected on a mandatory  basis  from all subsequent  patients  on C2D15 (+3 days).  Alternatively,  if such  data are 
not considered informative, these samples will not be collected from subsequent patients.  
Blood for immune correlates is to be collected pre- dose on C1D1, C2D1, C2D15 and C3D1 and at the 
end of treatment  visit. Blood  for protein lysine  acetylation testing  will be collect ed pre-dose on C1D1  and 
C1D15.  
Blood samples for determination of entinostat levels will be collected pre- dose on C1D1 and 2- [ADDRESS_1252420] dose; anytime post dose on C1D8 and D15, and pre- dose on C2D1.  
Blood  samples  for determination of atezolizumab levels  and anti-atezolizumab antibodies  will be collected 
pre-dose on C1D1 and again 30 minutes (+/ - 10 minutes)  following  infusion completion (this sample is for 
PK only), and pre- dose on C2D1, C4D1 and at the end of treatment visit. A PK sample will also be 
collected from any patient who continues to be followed per protocol for PFS, 120 days after the end of treatment visit.  
Patients will remain on study treatment until unequivocal progression of disease (PD), intolerable toxicity, or one of the other study withdrawal criteria is met (Protocol Section 11). Patients with radiographic 
progression only, as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_1252421], at the discretion of the investigator.  After 
study  treatment  discontinuation, patients will complete an End of Treatment  (EOT) visit  within  [ADDRESS_1252422] study drug dose and a Safety Follow -up (F/U) visit 30 d ays (+/ -3 days) later.  After completion of 
the 30-day (+/- 3 days)  Safety  F/U visit, patients  who have not experienced PD, are to be followed every  [ADDRESS_1252423] study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893900].  
Phase 1b / Dose Determination Phase: U
 p to 18 patients are expected to be enrolled in the Dose 
Determination Phase of the study which employs a classical 3+3 design, with the determination of DLT 
and the MTD and/or RP2D based on entinostat in combination with atezolizumab in C1. All dose cohorts will receive entinostat orally at the assigned dose on Days 1, 8 and 15 along with atezolizumab 1200 mg on Day 1 of a 21 day  cycle.  Dose group 1 will include  3-6 patients  who will receive entinostat  at a starting 
dose of 5 mg. If the entinostat  5 mg dose exceeds the MTD, then a 3 mg dose of entinostat (Dose Group

 -1) will be evaluated in the same manner.  If the entinostat  3 mg dose exceeds  the MTD,  then a 2 mg dose 
of entinostat  (Dose Group - 2) will be evaluated in the same manner. All patients within a cohort are to 
complete C1, have safety assessments performed through C2D1, and be assessed for DLT before 
enrollment of additional patients may commence. If <33% patients within a cohort have a DLT (i.e., <2 of 
6), then enrollment of the Phase [ADDRESS_1252424] at an alternate dose level or dosing schedule via a protocol amendment.  
Toxicities will be assessed by [CONTACT_893928] (US) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. Although  decisions 
regarding subsequent patient dosing will be made based on review of data from C1, safety data will also be collected from  all patients  continuing treatment  and these data will be reviewed in  an ongoing  manner 
by [CONTACT_893929]. Any detected cumulative toxicity may require later dose reductions  and/or  other  changes  to the dosing schedule,  as appropriate,  including 
further refinement of the RP2D.  
Phase 2 / Expansion :
  In the Expansion Phase, the efficacy and safety of entinostat (compared to 
placebo) in combination with atezolizumab will be evaluated using the RP2D identified in the Dose 
Determination Phase.  Following the enrollment  and completion through Cycle  [ADDRESS_1252425]. 
Up to 70 patients  with aTNBC  will be randomized to receive  atezolizumab + entinostat  or atezolizumab + 
placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_1252426] 3 patients per dose cohort, expanding to 6 patients in the event of a marginal  DLT rate (33%)  was deemed to be a safe and conventional  approach in the dose confirmation of 
a novel oncologic agent. Assuming a true DLT rate of 5% or less, there would be a 3% chance that dose escalation would be halted in a given cohort (i.e., observing 2 or more patients with DLT). If a true DLT 
rate of 50% is assumed, then there would be an 83% chance that dose escalation would be halted in a 
given cohort.  
Note:  Patients  who discontinued  the study  for reasons  other  than study  drug related  toxicities  before 
completing C1 may be replaced.  
Expansion P
 hase:  Phase 2 aTNBC Cohort  
The Expansion Phase will evaluate the efficacy and safety of entinostat  (compared to placebo) when 
administered at the RP2D with atezolizumab in a randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled setting. 
PFS will be the primary measure of efficacy; secondary measures of efficacy include ORR, CBR, DOR, TTR, and OS.  Up to 70 eligible patients with aTNBC will be randomized to receive atezolizumab with 
entinostat or placebo in a 1:1 allocation.  The sample size was determined based on the following 
considerations:  True median PFS for patients with a TNBC receiving atezolizumab monotherapy is 
expected to be approximately 4 months when measured from randomization.  It is hypothesized the 
combination of entinostat  and atezolizumab will improve true median PFS by 3 months (i.e., median PFS 
of 4 vs. 7 months).  Under  the exponential  distribution,  such  an improvement  in median  PFS represents  a 
reduction of 43% for the true PFS failure hazard rate or equivalently, a hazard ratio of 0.57.  The primary

Protocol  Number: SNDX -275-0602  (TRIO025) 
Date:  [ADDRESS_1252427] 1.1 or death due to any cause without documented progressive disease 
beforehand, is estimated to provide 80% power to detect the aforementioned 43% reduction in the PFS 
failure hazard rate with one -sided significance level of 0.1.  Assuming approximately 9 months of accrual 
and an additional  9 months  of follow -up, total accrual  of 70 patients  (approximately  35 per treatment  arm) 
is projected to result in [ADDRESS_1252428] 1.1 will continue to undergo disease assessments until the earlier of documented 
progressive disease,  death,  or withdrawal  of consent/lost  to follow -up. It is anticipated that the number  of 
patients  who will drop out of the study  without  PFS failure  beforehand will be low (expected to not exceed 
2–3%). Depending on the actual number of such dropouts, the number of patients accrued may be 
increased by 6– 10 additional patients to accommodate for a higher -than- expected number of dropouts.  
The sample size and number of PFS failures was adjusted using the O’Brien- Fleming group sequential 
procedure to account for one planned interim analysis of PFS after 45 events (75% information).  It is 
projected 75% and 100% of total information will be reported at approximately 12 and 18 months, 
respectively.  The interim  analysis  will be performed to support  the Sponsor’s  product  development  plans 
and ongoing resourcing activities.  Although there are no plans to terminate the study early because of 
early evidence of superior efficacy for the combination treatment, the significance levels at the interim analysis and final analysis will be adjusted to maintain control of the overall type I error rate for multiple 
testing of PFS ( O’Brie n 1979).

Investigational  Product:  
Entinostat  
Entinostat  is a synthetic small molecule bearing the chemical name 3- pyridylmethyl -N-{4-[(2- 
aminophenyl)carbonyl]  benzyl}carbamate  and the molecular  formula C 21H20N4O3, with a molecular  weight 
of 376.41. Entinostat is classified as an antineoplastic agent, specifically functioning as an inhibitor of 
histone deacetylases by [CONTACT_893932], allowing transcriptional 
activation of a distinct set of genes that leads to the inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of terminal 
differentiation, and/or apoptosis. Entinostat is given orally and is supplied in two strengths of film- coated 
tablets containing 1.0 mg (pi[INVESTIGATOR_22759]) or 5.0 mg (yellow).  
Entinostat  should  be stored  at a controlled  room temperature of 15°C –25°C  (59°F –77°F).  
Atezolizumab  
Atezolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to target PD -L1 expressed on tumor cells 
and tumor -infiltrating  immune cells,  and prevent  binding  to PD-1 and B7.1  on the surface of T cells.  This 
may enable the activation of effector T cells as well as recruitment of other T cells to attack the tumor, thus empowering the body's own immune system to fight multiple types of cancer.  
Atezolizumab drug product is provided in a single- use, 20- mL USP/PH. Eur. Type 1 glass vial as a 
colorless -to-slightly -yellow, sterile, preservative- free clear liquid solution intended for IV administration. 
The vial is designed to deliver 20 mL (1200 mg) of atezolizumab solution but may contain more than the stated volume to enable delivery of the entire 20- mL volume.  The atezolizumab drug product is 
formulated as 60 mg/mL of atezolizumab  in 20 mM histidine  acetate,  120 mM sucrose,  0.04%  polysorbate 
20, pH 5.8.  
Atezolizumab must be refrigerated at 2°C−8°C (36°F−46°F) upon receipt until use. Atezolizumab vials 
should not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_149941].  No preservative is used in 
the atezolizumab drug product; therefore, each vial is intended for single use only. Vial contents should not be frozen or shaken and should be protected from direct sunlight.  
Statistical  Considerations: 
The safety and efficacy analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_45968].  For the Dose Determination Phase, 
tabulations  will be provided  by [CONTACT_893933].  Some  analyses  may be performed based  on the 
Dose Determination and Expansion Phases combined.  
Safety A
nalyses  
Safety  analyses  will be conducted using  the Safety  Analysis  Set. 
An interim  safety  analysis  is planned following  the completion of Cycle  [ADDRESS_1252442].  
Treatment -emergent AEs reported during the study will be tabulated and listed by [CONTACT_16252] (MedDRA) System Organ Class  (SOC ) and Preferred Term (PT). Tables  will display 
number and percentage of patients experiencing the event for the following categories: all AEs; AEs considered related to study  treatment;  AEs by [CONTACT_926];  DLTs;  AEs occasioning treatment  delay,  reduction 
or discontinuation; and serious adverse events (SAEs). For the Dose Determination Phase, the observed DLT rate in each dose cohort will be calculated by [CONTACT_178897] a 2- sided 95% exact binomial confidence interval (CI).

 Hematology and serum chemistries will be summarized using conventional summary statistics (mean, 
standard deviation, median, and range) for the following: enrollment value, minimum and maximum post enrollment values, average post enrollment value, and last post enrollment value. Standard shift tables 
will also be prepared presenting worst  post enrollment  toxicity  grade versus  enrollment.  Vital signs  will be 
summarized in a descriptive manner by [CONTACT_61187], standard deviation, median, and range in 
the same manner described for laboratory values.  
Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy  analyses  will be conducted using  the Full Analysis Set and, where appropriate,  the Per -protocol 
Set. An interim efficacy analysis is planned after [ADDRESS_1252443] 1.1.  The disease progression date and censoring date will be based on published conventions ( 
FDA 2007).  Sensitivity analyses will be performed to identify asymmetry between treatment arms for the 
frequency of missed disease assessments, deviations of the actual disease assessment times from the planned assessment times.  Alternative censoring conventions will also be used to assess among other 
concerns,  dropouts  with undocumented progressive disease.  PFS will be summarized descriptively  using 
the Kaplan- Meier method.  The primary inferential  comparison between treatment arms  will be performed 
using the log- rank test stratified by [CONTACT_893934].  
Estimation of the hazard ratio for treatment arm will be determined using a stratified Cox proportiona l 
hazards  model,  without  any other  covariate.  The corresponding results  from the log-rank test and Cox 
model without stratification will be reported as supplemental analyses.  
The statistical  methods  to be used  for the analysis  and reporting of  the secondar y efficacy  endpoints  are 
described in Section 13.5 of the protocol.

3.OBJECTIVES 
 
3.1 Primary  
The primary  study  objectives  are: 
 
Phase 1b (Dose Determination Cohort) : To determine the dose -limiting  toxicities  (DLT)  and 
maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose  (RP2D) of entinostat  (SNDX - 
275) given in combination with atezolizumab. 
Phase 2 (Expansion Cohort) : To pe r form an evaluation of the efficacy of entinostat at the 
RP2D in combination with atezolizumab in patients  with aTNBC,  as determined by [CONTACT_893935] -free survival (PFS) based on the local investigator’s assessment of progressive 
disease using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) . 
3.2 Secondary  
Secondary  study  objectives  are: 
 
Efficacy : In Phase  2, to evaluate the efficacy  of entinostat  in combination with atezolizumab in 
patients with aTNBC, as determined by:  
• PFS based on immune -related RECIST  (irRECIST)  
• Overall  response rate (ORR)  (i.e., complete response [CR] or partial  response [PR]) 
based on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1252455] 
• Clinical benefit  rate (CBR)  (i.e. CR or PR or stable disease  [SD] for at least  24 weeks) 
based on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1252456] 
• Overall  survival (OS) 
In patients  with best overall  response of CR or PR: 
 
• Duration of response (DOR)  
• Time  to response  (TTR)  
Safety: To ev aluate  safety  and tolerability  of entinostat  in combination  with atezolizumab,  as 
measured by [CONTACT_178885] (AEs) and laboratory parameters.

Date:  [ADDRESS_1252459] cancer (TNBC) represents 15- 20% of newly diagnosed breast cancer 
cases, and is associated  with a younger  age and advanced stage  at diagnosis,  increased  risk of 
visceral metastasis and poorer outcome. The five -year survival rate for women diagnosed with 
Stage IV TNBC is only 22% with limited  treatment  options.  Development  of novel  approaches  to 
improve the treatment outcome for TNBC patients remains a significant unmet challenge. 
Immuno- oncology is an  emerging field of cancer  medi cine that has focused on the development 
of therapeutic approaches designed to activate the immune system to find and destroy cancer 
cells. The immune system consists of two parts, the innate immune system and the adaptive 
immune system and both play a role in an immune mediated effective anti -tumor immune 
response. The innate immune system, composed of key cells such as natural killer (NK) and neutrophils,  is non-specific  and is designed  to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_893904], such as infections and other pathogens. The adaptive immune system, composed of 
B cells,  T cells and other  immune regulatory  cells, targets  specific  antigens  and provides  a long- 
term response, known as immunologic memory, to antigens it recognizes as foreign.  
Many tumors have the ability to evade both the innate and adaptive immune system through direct cellular interactions and recruitment of immune- suppressive cells to the area surrounding 
the tumor ( Wu 2015) . Cancer cells can express proteins on their cell surface known as check 
point proteins, such as PD -L1 and programmed cell death protein ligand 2, or PD- L2, that block 
the ability of immune cells known as cytotoxic T cells to kill cancer cells ( Mahoney 2015; 
Sharma  2015).  Antibodies  that block  PD-L1 or PD-L2 restore  the ability  of cytotoxic  T cells to kill 
cancer cells and have shown great clinical promise. Positive results notwithstanding, durable responses have been observed in only a relatively small population of patients, with overall response rates below 30% depending on tumor type; this suggests that additional strategies enhancing the anti- tumor immune response are needed to improve the survival of cancer 
patients ( Mahoney 2015 ; Sharma 2015 ).

Protocol  Number: SNDX -275-0602  (TRIO025) 
Date:  [ADDRESS_1252460] in dampening the cytotoxic T cell response ( Joyce 2015 ; 
Mahoney 2015 ; Sharma 2015). MDSCs and Tregs localize in the area surrounding the tumor 
and, together with the immune checkpoints, play a significant role in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a tumor evade detection and elimination by [CONTACT_27639] ( Marvel 2015; Adeegbe).  
MDSCs are immature myeloid cells that are activated by [CONTACT_893937].  The primary  function of MDSCs is  to suppress  an activated  T cell 
immune response through the production and secretion of enzymes that deplete key amino 
acids required for the growth and function of cytotoxic T cells ( Marvel 2015 ). High 
concentrations  of circulating  MDSCs  in various  cancers, including breast,  lung,  head and neck, 
correspond with a poor prognosis and limited response to cancer therapy ( Liu 2010; Najjar  
2013; Solito 2011 ; Weed 2014). Recent data further indicate that high concentrations of 
circulating MDSCs in melanoma patients are inversely correlated with clinical response to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors  suggesting that targeting MDSCs may offer new therapeutic 
opportunities for enhancing the anti -tumor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors ( Weber  
2015).  
Tregs  are a second  type of immune  suppressor  cell and are recruited  to sites of active  immune 
response in order to shut down the cytotoxic T cell response ( Adeegbe 2013; Zhang 2015).  
Unlike MDSCs, which are found in activated states in circulating blood, Tregs are recruited to the tumor microenvironment and activated by [CONTACT_893938] ( Adeegbe 2013 ; 
Zhang 2015). As with MDSCs, an increase in the concentration of activated Tregs correlates with poor prognosis  in a number  of tumor  types  including  breast,  colorectal,  and ovarian cancers 
(Freiser 2013; Zhang 2015). Tregs suppress cytotoxic T cell responses through the secretion of 
cytokines that inhibit the growth of cytotoxic T cells. In addition Tregs can cause other immune regulatory cells in the tumor microenvironment to secrete immune suppressive enzymes  
(Freiser 2013; Zhang 2015). Inhibiting Tregs may therefore relieve immune suppression in a  
way similar and potentially complementary to that of other immune -targeted approaches.

Protocol  Number: SNDX -275-0602  (TRIO025) 
Date:  [ADDRESS_1252461] demonstrated that entinostat is a dual inhibitor of immune 
suppressor  cells and targets  both MDSCs  and Tregs.  Figure 5-1 below  shows  that entinostat 
reduces the growth of MDSCs at  concentrations that spare the growth of cytotoxic T cells.  
Approximately  half of the MDSCs  are stopped  from growing  at 200 nM of entinostat,  which  is 35 
times less than the concentration of entinostat  that stops half of the cytotoxic T cells from 
growing ( Kim 2014).  
Investigators have previously demonstrated FOXP3, a protein involved in Treg function, is an indicator of Treg immune suppressor activity. Figure 5 -2 below shows that entinostat reduces 
the expression  of FOXP3  protein in Tregs,  when  administered  in an animal  cancer  model,  thus 
demonstrating entinostat’s ability to inhibit Treg immune suppressor activity ( Shen 2012 ).

In order to  determine whether the effects observed in preclinical research studies can also be 
observed  in cancer  patients  treated with entinostat,  an analysis  was conducted  on immune  cells 
in blood samples collected from a subset of patients treated in ENCORE 301, a  Phase 2b 
clinical trial in advanced HR+ breast cancer patients. As shown in Figure 5- [ADDRESS_1252462]:  Entinostat

observed that entinostat reduced the number and activity of MDSCs, rather than attacking and destroying replicating cells like standard chemotherapy drugs. The significant anti -tumor effect 
of entinostat combine with immune checkpoint blockade in the 4T1 TNBC mouse model supports the clinical testing of entinostat combined with atezolizumab in TNBC.

Clinical. In patients who  were treated in two unrelated clinical  trials, physicians at JHU observed 
preliminary evidence for the potential beneficial effects of combining entinostat with a PD -[ADDRESS_1252464] 3% overall response rate (Juergens 2011). However, investigators observed 
that patients who received the combination of entinostat and azacitidine and subsequently received immune checkpoint therapy demonstrated a higher response rate than expected for this patient population. Figure 5 -5 below illustrates that all five patients who received either 
nivolumab, an approved anti -PD-1, or an investigational PDL- 1 inhibitor as their next therapy 
derived durable  clinical benefit.  Three of the patients had durable responses and two had 
durable stable disease. This enhanced response rate was better than the 15% response to nivolumab alone observed in a similar advanced NSCLC population and led investigators to hypothesize that the prior effect of the combination of entinostat and azacitidine therapy was 
“priming” the tumors to the subsequent immune therapy (Wrangle 2013).  To confirm these 
findings and further explore the ability of the combination of azacitidine and entinostat to 
enhance the response of NSCLC patients to nivolumab, the investigators at JHU have initiated  
a follow -on randomized Phase [ADDRESS_1252465]:  Entinostat

Based on these findings  it is hypothesized that entinostat  combined with a PD-1/PD -L1-blocking 
antibody, atezolizumab, will result in an improvement in PFS for the combination compared to

5.1 Study Treatment  
 
5.1.1  Entinostat  (SNDX -275) 
 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) within the cell nucleus combines with a class of proteins called 
histones to form chr omatin. Histones have amino terminal groups that are positively charged 
and are deacetylated  by [CONTACT_178904].  The positive  charge tightly  binds  the histones  to the negatively 
charged DNA phosphodiester backbone. Gene transcription and expression are inhibited by [CONTACT_88318] a condensed conformation of the DNA. Histone acetyltransferases acetylate the amino terminal ends and neutralize their positive charges, thus leading to a more open chromatin conformation, facilitating DNA transcription.

deacetylases  (HDACs). Entinostat  promotes  hyperacetylation of nucleosomal  histones,  allowing 
transcriptional activation of a distinct set of genes. This ultimately leads to the inhibition of cell 
proliferation, induction of terminal differentiation, and/or apoptosis ( Hess -Stumpp, 2007 ). 
Altered activity  of HDACs  and inactivation of histone acetyltransferases  within  transformed cells 
are key events that affect chromatin remodeling. There is evidence that HDACs are associated with a wide range of tumors including melanomas, neuroblastomas, lymphomas, and lung, breast, prostate, ovarian, bladder, and colon cancers. In a number of in vitro models, HDAC 
inhibitors triggered growth arrest and induced cell differentiation or apoptosis. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, recruitment of HDACs by [CONTACT_893939].  
Entinostat also induced histone hyperacetylation and induced expression of various tumor 
suppressor genes. Various in vitro studies in a range of human  cancer cell lines have 
demonstrated  the antiproliferative  activity  of entinostat.  In vivo, entinostat  inhibited  the growth of 
a range  of human  tumor  xenograft  model,  including lung,  prostate,  breast,  pancreatic,  renal  cell, 
and glioblastoma.  
More recently, entinostat has been shown to modify the phenotype of cancer cells from a mesenchymal to an epi[INVESTIGATOR_640227], leading to a reduction in the metastatic potential of the 
cancer  cells (Shah,  2014 ). In addition,  there is a suggestion that entinostat  may have  longer 
term effects on cancer phenotypes, cancer stem cells (CSCs) or progenitor cell pool and potential sensitization to subsequent post -study treatments ( Juergens, 2011).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Background  
Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody consisting of two heavy  chains  (448 amino  acids)  and two light chains  (214 amino  acids)  and is 
produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells.  Atezolizumab was engineered to eliminate Fc - 
effector function via a single amino acid substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position [ADDRESS_1252470].

responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an 
immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4, which has been shown 
to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or 
programmed  death  ligand-2 [PD-L2]). The structures  of murine  PD-1 alone  (Zhang  2004 ) and in 
complex with its ligands have been resolved ( Lazar -Molnar 2008 ; Lin 2008), and more recently 
the nuclear magnetic resonance- based structure of the human PD -1 extracellular region and 
analyses of its interactions with its ligands were also reported ( Cheng 2013). PD -1 and family 
members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable-t ype (V -type) 
domain responsible for  ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail  which is responsible for  the binding 
of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine- based signaling motifs, 
an immunoreceptor tyrosine- based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine- 
based switch  motif  (ITSM). Following  T cell stimulation,  PD-1 recruits  the tyrosine phosphatases 
SHP-1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its  cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation 
of effector molecules, such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70, which are involved in the CD3 T cell 
signaling cascade ( Sheppard 2004 ). The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_1252472] from that of CTLA -4 (Ott 2013). PD -1 was shown to be 
expressed on activated lymphocytes, including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, T 
regs and natural killer cells ( Yao 2014 ). Expression has also been shown during thymic 
development on CD4-CD8- (i.e., double -negative) T cells ( Nishimura 1996 ), as well as subsets 
of macrophages ( Huang 2009) and dendritic cell s (Pena- Cruz 2010). The ligands for PD -1 
(PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively  expressed or can be induced in a variety  of cell types  (Keir 
 
 
2008).  PD-L1 is expressed at low levels  on various  non-hematopoietic  tissues,  most  notably  on 
vascular endothelium, whereas PD- L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- 
presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments ( Keir 2008 ). 
Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both Ig variable- and Ig constant - 
like domains in the extracellular region and short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either  PD-1 ligand to PD-1 inhibits  T cell activation  triggered through  the T cell 
receptor.  PD-L2 is thought to control immune T cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas  
PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T cell function in peripheral tissues. Although healthy 
organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express 
abundant  levels  of this T cell inhibitor  (Karim  2009 ; Taube  2012 ), wh

(Sanmamed 2014).  As a consequence,  the PD-1/PD -L1 pathway  is an attractive target  for 
therapeutic intervention in cancer ( Topalian 2012 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Atezolizumab  Non-Clinical  Studies Summary  
The nonclinical strategy of the atezolizumab program was to demonstrate in vitro and in vivo 
activity, to determine in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior, to demonstrate an acceptable safety  profile,  and to identify  a Phase  I starting  dose.  Comprehensive pharmacology,  PK, and 
toxicology evaluations were performed with atezolizumab. 
The safety,  pharmacokinetics,  and toxicokinetics  of atezolizumab were  investigated in mice  and 
cynomolgus monkeys to support intravenous (IV) adminis tration and to aid in projecting the 
appropriate  starting  dose  in humans.  Given  the similar  binding  of atezolizumab  for cynomolgus 
monkey and human PD -L1, the cynomolgus monkey was selected as the primary and relevant 
nonclinical model for understanding the safety, pharmacokinetics, and toxicokinetics of 
atezolizumab.  
Overall, the nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics observed for atezolizumab 
supported entry into clinical studies, including providing adequate safety factors for the 
proposed  Phase I starting  doses.  The results  of the toxicology  program  were  consistent  with the 
anticipated pharmacologic activity of downmodulating the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_1252474]; heightened 
immune responses and the potential to increase immune -associated inflammatory lesions were 
identified as possible safety risks in patients.  
Refer  to the Atezolizumab  Investigator’s  Brochure  (IB) for details  on the nonclinical  studies.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Atezolizumab  Clinical  Studies  Summary  
Atezolizumab is currently being tested in multiple Phase I, II, and III studies, both as 
monotherapy  and in combination with several  anti-cancer  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (see the Atezolizumab 
Investigator’s Brochure for study descriptions). The single- agent safety and efficacy data 
available to date are from the following studies: one Phase Ia (Study PCD4989g) and two Phase II studies (Studies GO28625 [FIR] and GO28753 [POPLAR]).  
Clinical benefit from atezolizumab monotherapy was observed in a broad range of  malignancies 
including non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC),  renal  cell carcinoma  (RCC),  melanoma,  urothelial 
bladder cancer (UBC), head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer and sarcoma.  
Results  sugges t that PD-L1 expression in the tumor  microenvironment  is associated with an 
increased probability of clinical benefit with atezolizumab.

PD-L1 such as atezolizumab results  in approximately  an 18-19% response  rate in women  with 
TNBC who also test positive for PD-L1 expression.  While  these  data are promising,  the benefit 
appears to be restricted to a relatively small fraction of the total TNBC patient population.  
Combination strategies to increase the clinical benefit of PD -1 / PD -L1 inhibitors in TNBC are 
the focus of intense research efforts. Preclinical testing in the 4T1 mouse model  of TNBC 
indicate that entinostat combined with immune checkpoint blockade results in complete inhibition  of primary  tumors  and metastases.  The mechanism  for this combined  anti-tumor  effect 
was determined to be entinostat’s ability to inhibit the growth an d function of MDSCs, an 
immune suppressor cell shown to block the anti -tumor T cell immune response. These data 
provide the basis for  clinical testing of entinostat  combined with atezolizumab in TNBC patients.  
5.3 Rationale for the Dose  Selection 
 
5.3.1  Entinostat  
 
Entinostat  has been  evaluated in vitro, in nonclinical  in vivo studies,  and in Phase  1 and 
2 studies  in patients  with various  solid tumors  and hematological malignancies  at doses  
between 2 and 12 mg/m2 and at dosing  frequencies  ranging  from once  daily to every  [ADDRESS_1252477] -dose. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of entinostat have  
Product:  Entinostat  
Protocol  Numbe r: SNDX -275-0602  (TRIO025) 
Date:  [ADDRESS_1252478] -dose at doses of 2 to 
12 mg/m2. 
The MTD  for single  agent  entinostat  in non-hematologic  indications  was established as 4 mg/m2 
weekly  x [ADDRESS_1252479], or 10 mg/m2 every  other  week  continuously.  
 
PK analyses have demonstrated ~40% variability in the clearance of entinostat. However, when 
clearance was adjusted  for body  surface  area (BSA),  the inter-patient  variability  was similar.  In a 
linear regression analysis on factors that may contribute to this variability, ideal body weight, lean body mass, body weight, and body mass index, were not significant covariates. As a result of this analysis, fixed dosing is considered to be as accurate as dosing based on BSA ( Alao,  
2004).  
Entinostat  given  once  weekly  continuously  at a dose  of 5 mg (in combination with the aromatase 
inhibitor exemestane) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer or given every other week continuously at a dose of 10 mg (in combination with erlotinib) in patients with stage  IIIB/IV  NSCLC, was  well tolerated.  The AE profile  at these  dose schedules  was consistent 
with previous clinical experience, with the most common AEs being fatigue and gastrointestinal disturbances, (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).  
Based on the clinical experience with entinostat, fixed dose of 5 mg given weekly has been selected as the starting dose  for this study,  with dose  initial de-escalation to 3 mg and secondly 
to 2 mg, if toxicity occurs with the combination treatment.  
 
5.3.2  Atezolizumab 
 
The fixed  dose  of 1200  mg (equivalent  to an average body  weight −based  dose of 15 mg/kg) 
was selected on the basis of  both nonclinical studies and available clinical data from Study 
PCD4989g as described below.  
The target exposure for atezolizumab was projected on the basis of nonclinical tissue distribution data in tumor -bearing mice,  target -receptor  occupancy  in the tumor, the observed 
atezolizumab interim pharmacokinetics in humans, and other factors.  The target trough 
concentration (C
trough) was projected to be 6 µg/mL on the basis of several assumptions, 
including:  1) 95% tumor -receptor  saturation  is needed for efficacy and 2) the tumor -interstitial 
concentration to plasma ratio is 0.[ADDRESS_1252480]:  Entinostat

The atezolizumab dose is also informed by [CONTACT_33444], safety, PK, and 
immunogenicity  data.  Anti-tumor  activity  (ATA)  has been observed across  doses  from 1 mg/kg 
to 20 mg/kg  administered q3w.  The MTD  of atezolizumab was not reached,  and no DLTs  have 
been observed at any dose in Study PCD4989g. Available preliminary PK data (0.03 −20 
mg/kg) from Study PCD4989g suggest that for doses ≥ 1 mg/kg q3w, overall atezolizumab 
exhibits pharmacokinetics that are both linear and consistent with typi[INVESTIGATOR_226798]1 antibodies.  
Detectable  ATAs  were  observed in patients  at all dose levels  but were  associated with changes 
in pharmacokinetics  for some  patients  in only the lower  dose  cohorts  (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg).  It is 
unclear from currently available data in these lower dose cohorts whether administration of higher doses to patients with both detectable ATAs and reduced exposure would necessarily restore exposure to expected levels.  No clear relationship between the development of 
measurable ATAs and safety or efficacy has been observed.  Available data suggest that the 
development of detectable ATAs does not appear to have a significant impact on pharmacokinetics for doses from 10 to 20 mg/kg administered q3w in most  
patients.  Correspondingly,  patients  dosed at the 10-, 15-, and 20-mg/kg q3w dose levels  have 
maintained target trough concentrations of drug despi[INVESTIGATOR_33384].  
Currently available PK and anti- treatment antibody data suggest that the 15- mg/kg 
atezolizumab q3w regimen (or  fixed -dose  equivalent)  would be sufficient to both maintain 
C
trough ≥ 6 µg/mL  and further  safeguard against  both interpatient  variability  and potential  effect  of 
ATAs that could lead to sub- therapeutic levels of atezolizumab relative to the 10- mg/kg  q3w 
regimen (or fixed -dose equivalent).  From inspection of available observed C trough data, a  
20 mg/kg atezolizumab q3w regimen  does  not appear  to be warranted  to maintain targeted 
Ctrough levels relative to the proposed 15- mg/kg q3w level.  
Simulations ( Bai et al. 2012) do not suggest any clinically meaningful differences in exposure 
following  fixed  dose  or dose  adjusted  for weight.  On the basis  of this analysis,  a fixed  dose  of 
1200 mg q3w is selected (equivalent to a body weight −based dose of 15 mg/kg q3w).  
Selection of an every -21-day dosing interval  is supported by [CONTACT_893942] a convenient integration with common therapeutic regimens.  
5.4 Hypothesis  
Phase 1b: The combination of atezolizumab  and entinostat  at a biologically  active dose will be 
suffic iently safe and well tolerated to warrant further investigation.

Regardless of phase, patients will be screened for study eligibility within 21 days before 
enrollment.  Patients  who are determined to be eligible,  based on screening assessments,  will 
be enrolled in the study within 3 business days of starting study treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1).  
A cycle is 21 days  in length.  During  treatment,  patients  will attend study  center  visits  and study 
evaluations will be performed on C1D1, C1D8, and C1D15; D1 and D15 of C2; and on D1 of each cycle thereafter.

Fresh tumor  tissue core biopsy  (image- guided  if applicable)  will be collected during  the study  as 
follows.:  
• During  screening from all patients  on a mandatory basis.  Archival  tumor  tissue will also 
be collected when available.  
• On C2D15 (+ /-3 days) on an optional basis from patients in the Phase 1b Dose 
Determination Phase . All patients  in the Dose  Determination Phase  will be strongly 
encouraged to undergo an optional  biopsy  in order  to help understand dose -immune 
correlate effects.  
• On C2D15  (+/-3 days)  on a mandatory  basis  until 20 samples  are obtained  in the 
Phase 2 Expansion  Phase and on an optional  basis  for subsequent  patients  in this 
phase.  
• At the end of study  treatment  prior to the start of another  systemic therapy,  on an 
optional  basis  for all patients.  
• At disease progression  on an optional  basis  for all patients.  
If, based on an interim review of tumor tissue data from the initial patients in the Expansion 
Phase, such data are considered informative, tumor tissue samples will be collected on a mandatory  basis  from all subsequent  patients  on C2D15  (+/-3 days).  Alternatively,  if such data 
are not considered informative, subsequent samples will not be collected.  
Blood f
or  immune  correlates  is to be collected  pre-dose on each  of C1D1,  C2D1,  C2D15,  C3D1 
and at the end of treatment. Blood for protein lysine acetylation is to be collected pre -dose on 
C1D1 and C1D15.  Patients will have radiological disease assessments performed every  
6 w eeks  (+/-3 days) (Week  6, Week  12, etc.) beginning at C1D1,  during  study  treatment  through 
week 36 or until progressive disease. If progressive disease has not occurred by [CONTACT_5875] 36, radiological assessments will then be done every 9 weeks (+/ -3 days) until  progressive disease. 
If a patient comes off study for reasons other than progressive disease, radiological assessments will continue at [ADDRESS_1252483] been study week 36 and 
then switch to a 9 week interval, until progressive disease is radiologically documented.  
Disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_20420] (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
and bone scans, as appropriate, and response will be assessed by [CONTACT_893943].  The same imaging  modality  should  be employed for all follow- up scans  as was used 
at baseline.

Safety  will be assessed during the study  by [CONTACT_178888],  clinical laboratory  tests, 
physical  examination,  vital sign measurements,  ECGs,  and Eastern Cooperative  Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status.  
Within  [ADDRESS_1252484] dose of study  treatment,  all patients  will complete an End of Treatment 
(EOT) visit, and a Safety Follow -up (F/U) visit will be required 30 days (+/ - 3 days) thereafter.  
After  completion  of the 30-day F/U visit, patients  who have  experienced  progressive disease  are 
to be contact[CONTACT_457] [ADDRESS_1252485] not experienced progressive disease, will continue radiological disease assessments as 
noted above.  
Phase 1b (Dose Determination) : This study phase employs a classical 3+3 design, with the 
determination of DLT and the MTD or RP2D based on the combination of entinostat wit h 
atezolizumab in C1. Six patients will need to be treated in a dose level for it to be considered MTD  or the RP2D.The  recommended dose for Phase  2 investigation  will be the higher  of either 
2, 3 or 5 mg weekly PO that results in less than a 33% incidence of DLT.  The final 
determination of the optimal dose for further use will consider both acute and cumulative 
toxicities; the incidence of required dose delays, reductions, and discontinuations; and the overall facility of administration in clinical practice . 
The initial 3-6 patients  will receive entinostat  at a starting dose  of 5 mg (Dose  Group 1) on D1, 
D8, and D15 along with atezolizumab 1200  mg via intravenous  (IV) infusion  on D1 of each 21- 
day cycle.  
If the 5 mg dose exceeds the MTD, then a 3 mg dose of entinostat (Dose Group - 1) will be 
evaluated in the same manner. If the -1 dose level exceeds the MTD, then a 2 mg dose of 
entinostat (Dose Group -2) will be evaluated.  Based on evaluation of the safety  and tolerability 
data gathered  during the dose determination phase together  with data from other  clinical trials,  it 
may also be decided that accrual will take place at an alternate dose level or dosing schedule via a protocol amendment.  
Patients who experience a DLT will be allowed to remain on study if they meet the following 
criteria; (1) the investigator  believes  it is appropriate for patients  to remain  on study  (2) the event 
has resolved and no longer meets the definition of DLT and (3) the timeline for resolution falls 
within the guidelines for dose delays ( Section 9.10).

Phase 2 (Expansion) : The efficacy and safety of entinostat  in combination with atezolizumab 
will be evaluated using the RP2D identified in the Dose Determination Phase. In this 
randomized, placebo- controlled, double -blind study phase, 70 patients will be randomized in a 
1:1 fashion  to atezolizumab + entinostat  versus atezolizumab + placebo.  The randomization  will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_268050] (US vs. rest of world).  
Patients  will follow the same  schedule of study  visits and assessments  as specified in the Dose 
Determination phase. The exception is the C2D15 tumor tissue core biopsy. While this was 
optional in the Dose Determination phase, it is mandatory in the Expansion Phase until [ADDRESS_1252486] (DSMB). The development of serious adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_893944] a continuous  basis. At the first DSMB  meeting,  the DSMB  members  will 
confirm which SAEs they need to see real time or at time of DSMB meetings only. Unless the 
DSMB wishes to suspend enrollment during the review of the safety data for the first [ADDRESS_1252487] to closure in consultation with the Sponsor.  
6.3 Number  of Patients 
Phase 1b Dose  Determination  Phase:  Up to [ADDRESS_1252488] “3+3” Phase 1 dose finding scheme.  Six 
patients will need to be treated in a dose level for it to be considered MTD or the RP2D. 
Entinostat  dosing will start at 5 mg po weekly  and then decrease to 3 mg weekly  in the case that 
the 5 mg weekly  dose  leads  to ≥ 2 DLTs.  It will again be de-escalated  to 2 mg weekly  should the 
3 mg weekly dose lead to ≥ [ADDRESS_1252489]:  Entinostat

Note:  The patients  who discontinued the study  for reasons  other  than study  drug related 
toxicities before completing Cycle 1 may be replaced.  
In the Phase 2 Expansion Phase, a total of 70 TNBC patients are planned to be enrolled for 
evaluation (35 patients per arm).  Note:  It is anticipated that the number of patients who will 
drop out of the study  without  PFS failure  beforehand will be low (expected  to not exceed 2– 3%). 
Depending on the actual number of such dropouts, the number of patients accrued may be increased by 6– 10 additional patients to accommodate for a higher- than-expected number of 
dropouts.  
6.4 Estimated  Study Duration 
The estimated  duration of study  enrollment  is approximately  15 months;  6 months  for the Phase 
1b and 9 months for the Phase 2. Patients may continue study treatment until unequivocal progressive disease, intolerable toxicity or meets one of the study withdrawal criteria (Protocol Section 11). Patients will be followed for overall survival until the Sponsor terminates the trial.

9.2 Entinostat  
 
9.2.1  Supply and Storage 
 
Entinostat  is a synthetic small molecule bearing the chemical name 3- Pyridylmethyl N -{4-[(2- 
aminophenyl)carbamoyl]benzyl}carbamate and the molecular formula C 21H20N4O3, with a 
molecular weight of 376.41. Entinostat is classified as an antineoplastic agent, specific ally 
functioning as an inhibitor of histone deacetylases that promotes hyperacetylation of nucleosomal histones,  allowing  transcriptional activation of a distinct  set of genes  that leads  to 
the inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of terminal differ entiation, and/or apoptosis. 
Entinostat/placebo is an oral drug  supplied by [CONTACT_893946][INVESTIGATOR_22759] (1 mg) or 
yellow (5 mg) as polymorph B coated tablets. Each tablet contains mannitol, sodium starch glycolate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, potassium bicarbonate, and magnesium stearate as inert 
fillers.  The film coating consists  of hypromellose,  talc, titanium  dioxide,  and ferric  oxide pi[INVESTIGATOR_165639] 
(red and yellow) as colorants.  
Entinostat/placebo is to be stored  at controlled room  temperature  (15ºC  to 25ºC  / 59ºF to 77ºF ) 
in a secure, locked storage area to which access is limited.  
Entinostat/placebo is to be protected from light. Entinostat/placebo is not to be exposed to 
extremes  of temperature  (greater  than 30ºC  / 86°F  or less than 5ºC / 41°F).  The pharmacist  will 
dispense the investigational  material  to the patient  at appropriate intervals  throughout  the study 
in childproof containers.  
Entinostat/placebo will be supplied to patients  in bottles  containing  enough pi[INVESTIGATOR_132918] a 3-week 
cycle, plus an additional dose in case tablets are lost.

Please refer to the Pharmacy  Manual  for complete details  regarding supply,  storage 
accountability and destruction Entinostat. 
 
9.2.2  Dosing and Administration 
 
All patients  will self-administer  entinostat/placebo  PO once  weekly  on study  days  1, 8 and 15 of 
each 21 day cycle. A new bottle of entinostat/placebo will be dispensed  on day 1 of each  cycle, 
regardless of the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_893905]. 
On study  days  on which  patients  receive both entinostat/placebo and atezolizumab, 
entinostat/placebo is to be taken prior to atezolizumab. 
Entinostat/placebo is to be taken on an empty  stomach,  at least  [ADDRESS_1252505] 1 hour before the next meal.  
If an entinostat/placebo dose is missed, it may be taken up to 48 hours after the scheduled 
dosing time.  If it is not taken  within  the 48 hour window,  the dose should  not be taken  and will 
be counted as a missed dose. The patient should take the next scheduled dose per protocol. Missed doses should be noted as such on the patient drug diary and in the eCRF.  
If entinostat/placebo is vomited,  dosing should not be re-administered but instead the dose 
should be skipped.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase 1b 
During the Phase 1b Dose Determination Phase,  all patients  will receive  atezolizumab 1200 mg 
IV on D1 of each 21 day cycle. They will also receive entinostat orally weekly on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle at either  5 mg, 3 mg or 2 mg. Both drugs  will be given in an open- label  fashion.  
Patients  who discontinue from the study  treatment  for reasons  other  than study  drug- related 
toxicity before completing C1 may be replaced (refer to section 9.4). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase 2 
During the Phase 2 Dose Expansion Phase, all patients will receive atezolizumab 1200 mg IV on D1 of each  21 day cycle. They  will also receive the RP2D of entinostat  or matched placebo 
weekly on days 1, 8 and 15 or  each cycle. Entinostat/placebo will be given in double blind 
fashion.  
Any det
ected  cumulative  toxicity  may require  later dose reductions  and/or  other  changes  to the 
dosing schedule, as appropriate, including further refinement of the RP2D.

as a colorless -to-slightly -yellow, sterile, preservative- free clear liquid solution intended for IV 
administration.  The vial is designed to deliver 20 mL (1200 mg) of atezolizumab solution but 
may contain more  than the stated  volume to enable delivery  of the entire 20-mL volume.  The 
atezolizumab drug product is formulated as 60 mg/mL of atezolizumab in 20 mM histidine 
acetate, 120 mM sucrose, 0.04% polysorbate 20, pH 5.8.  
Atezolizumab must be refrigerated at 2°C−8°C (36°F−46°F) upon receipt until use. Atezolizumab vials should not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_242652].  No preservative is used  in the atezolizumab drug product;  therefore,  each  vial is 
intended for single use only. Vial contents should not be frozen or shaken and should be 
protected from direct s unlight.  
Atezolizumab is supplied by [CONTACT_893947].  
 
9.3.2  Dosing and Administration 
 
The dose level of atezolizumab in this study  is 1200 mg administered by [CONTACT_16228] q3w. 
 
Administration  of atezolizumab will be performed  in a setting with emergency  medical  facilities 
and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  
The initial dose of atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 ( ± 15) minutes. If the first infusion is 
tolerated without  infusion -associated adverse events,  the second infusion may be delivered  over 
30 (± 10) minutes.  If the 30- minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be 
delivered over 30 ( ± 10) minutes, otherwise it should be delivered over 60 (±15) minutes. The 
patient’s vital signs (heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and temperature) should be determined no more than [ADDRESS_1252507]:  Entinostat

9.4 Study Drug(s)  Accountability  
The lot number(s)  of the study  drugs  (entinostat  and atezolizumab)  received at the site are to be 
recorded on the Drug Accountability Log maintained by [CONTACT_32335]. Additional distribution and return information will also be recorded at the site.  
Patient  medication  instructions  and dosing  diaries  will be provided to the patient  for purposes  of 
recording entinostat/placebo self -administration.  
9.5 Entinostat  Compliance  
Treatment compliance to entinostat will be assessed at the end of each cycle. Patients will complete a diary to document their weekly intakes. They will be instructed to return all unused drugs (partially used and empty containers) and their diary at each visit. Site staff will perform accountability of the returned drug and will assess patient compliance.  Site staff must ensure 
that the patient  clearly  understands  the directions  for self-medication  and follows  the schedule.

9.9 Treatment  Duration  
The duration of treatment for this study is expected to be 1 year. Patients may remain on study 
until unequivocal progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another treatment withdrawal criteria is met per Protocol Section 11. Study patients with evidence of radiological progressive 
disease who meet the criteria set forth in Protocol Section 10.3.2 for “Treatment After Initial 
Radiological  Progression”,  should continue treatment  and be followed  according to irRECIST  as 
described in section 10.3.2 . Any questions should be directed to the Medical Monitor.  
If a patient  permanently  discontinues  either  study  drug (entinostat/placebo  or atezolizumab),  the 
patient will be taken off study treatment and followed for progressive disease per protocol guidelines, or overall survival should progressive disease have been previously determined on 
study.  Patients will receive standard of care outside the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_893906]’s discretion.  
After  discontinuation of study  treatment,  patients  will complete an EOT visit within  7 days  (+/- 3 
days) after the last study drug dose and a Safety F/U visit 30 days (+/ - 3 days) th ereafter.  
After completion of the 30- day
  Safety F/U visit, patients who have not  experienced PD are to 
continue to undergo radiological assessments every [ADDRESS_1252517] conservative approach (i.e., delays and/or dose reductions for both drugs) until resolution of the event, or the patient is taken off study. However, if the toxicit y is 
clearly associated with only one of the study drugs, then the other study drug may be continued at the discretion of the study investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor, until  
resolution of the event or the patient is taken off study.

Note:  If a patient  permanently  discontinues  either  study  drug (entinostat/placebo or 
atezolizumab), the patient will be taken off study treatment  
No dose reductions  will be performed for atezolizumab.  
 
Guidance for entinostat  delays and or dose reductions can be found in Protocol Section 9.10.[ADDRESS_1252518]. Such instances should be reported to the Medical Monitor.  
Expected AEs for each agent  are summarized  in Section 12. 
 
9.10.1  Entinostat  
 
In Phase 1b, dose delays, but not dose reductions will be allowed for entinostat during Cycle 1.  
If a dose  reduction is required during Cycle  1, the patient  will be taken  off study.  Dose  delays  for 
reasons other than toxicities definitely or possibly related to entinostat should be avoided as much as possible during Cycle 1.  
In P
hase  2, both dose  delays  and dose  reductions  will be allowed  as described below.  Once  the 
entinostat  dose is reduced, it cannot be re -escalated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-hematologic  Toxicity  at Least  Possibly Related to Entinostat  
The rules outlined in Table 9- 1 are to be followed for the management of non- hematologic 
toxicities that are definitely or possibly due to entinostat alone, with toxicities graded by [CONTACT_893948], CTCAE,  version  4.03.  Note:  No dose  reduction is allowed 
during the first study treatment cycle in phase 1b.

Throughout the study, the Investigator may prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care, such  as potassium  and 
phosphorus  supplements  and antiemetics,  with the exception of those  listed  in Section 9.12. 
No premedication will be allowed for the first dose of atezolizumab.  Premedication may be 
administered for subsequent infusions at the discretion of the treating physician after consultation with the Medical  Monitor.  Patients  must  notify  the Investigator  of all concomitant 
medications taken through completion of the study (30 day follow -up safety  visit).  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing study ( Section 9.12). If there is a clinical indication for any medication or 
vaccination specifically prohibited during the study, discontinuation from study drug will be 
required.  The Investigator  should  discuss any questions  regarding  this with the Medical  Monitor.

the mutual agreement of the investigator, the Medical Monitor and the patient.  
9.12 Prohibited Medication 
The following  medications  are excluded while  the patient  is receiving study  treatment:  
• Any other  HDAC inhibitor,  including valproic  acid 
• DNA  methyltransferase inhibitors  
• Any additional investigational or commercial anticancer agents, such as chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy,  targeted  therapy,  biological  response modifiers,  or endocrine therapy,  will 
not be allowed, even if utilized as treatment of non- cancer indications.  
• Prophylactic  use of hematopoietic  colony  stimulating  factors  are not allowed  during the 
Phase 1b, but can be used per investigator discretion during other parts of the study.  
• Radiation therapy  
Note:  Radiation therapy  to a symptomatic  solitary  lesion  or to the brain may be considered 
on an exceptional case -by-case basis after consultation with the Medical Monitor. The 
radiation field cannot  encompass  a target  lesion.  Radiation to a target  lesion is considered 
progressive  disease and the subject  should be removed  from study  treatment.  The patient 
must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field. Administration of palliative 
radiation therapy will be considered clinical progression.  
• Traditional  herbal  medicines;  these  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893909]- drug interactions that may cause or confound the assessment of toxicity  
• RANKL inhibitor (denosumab): patients who are receiving denosumab pri or to 
randomization must  be willing  and eligible  to receive a bisphosphonate instead while  on 
study  
• Immunomodulatory  agents,  including but not limited  to interferons  or IL-2, during the entire 
study; these agents could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions when 
received in combination with atezolizumab  
• Immunosuppressive medications, including but not limited to cyclophosphamide, azathioprine,  methotrexate,  and thalidomide;  these agents  could potentially  alter the activity 
and the safety  of atezolizumab  
• Us
e  of steroids  to premedicate patients  for whom  CT scans  with contrast  are contraindicated 
(i.e., patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance); in such  patients, MRIs of the 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis with a non- contrast CT scan of the chest must be performed  
• Any live, attenuated  vaccine (e.g.,  FluMist) while  the patient  is receiving atezolizumab and 
for a period of [ADDRESS_1252524]:  Entinostat

Influenza vaccinations  (inactivated forms  only)  should be given during influenza season only 
(approximately October to March in the Northern hemisphere and April to September in the 
Southern Hemisphere).  
Systemic corticosteroids  and anti−TNF-α agents  may attenuate  potential  beneficial immunologic 
effects of treatment with atezolizumab. If feasible, alternatives to these agents should be considered. Systemic corticosteroids may be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician in consultation with the Medical  Monitor  at doses  no greater  than [ADDRESS_1252525] dose  of 
atezolizumab.  
Patients who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_737], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments  for clinical management  should be removed  from the study,  unless 
as otherwise noted. Patients may receive other medications that the Investigator deems to be 
medically necessary.  
The exclusion criteria  (Section 7.2) describe other  medications  that are prohibited in this study.  
 
9.13 Medications  to be Avoided D uring the Study  
Concomitant  use of the drugs  below  with entinostat  should be avoided during the study:  
• Sensitive  substrates  of CYP enzymes  listed  in Appendix  2 
• Drugs  that are known  to inhibit  or induce P- gp (see Appendix  2) 
Should the use of these medications  be required,  the Medical  Monitor  must  be consulted for 
guidance.

All events of diarrhea or colitis should be thoroughly evaluated for other more common 
etiologies.  If the event is of significant duration or magnitude or is associated with signs of 
system ic inflammation or acute phase reactants (e.g., increased C -reactive protein, platelet 
count,  or bandemia),  perform  sigmoidoscopy  (or colonoscopy,  if appropriate)  with colonic  biopsy 
with three to five specimens for standard paraffin block to check for inflammation and lymphocytic infiltrates for confirmation of the diagnosis of colitis.  
Perform  laboratory  tests  to rule out alternate etiology  (i.e., WBCs  and stool  calprotectin).

9.14.11  Immune- Related  Meningoencephalitis  
Immune- related meningoencephalitis is an identified risk associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Immune -related meningoencephalitis should be suspected in any patient 
present ing with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or encephalitis, including, but not 
limited  to, headache,  neck  pain,  confusion,  seizure,  motor  or sensory  dysfunction,  and altered or 
depressed level of consciousness. Encephalopathy from metabolic or electrolyte imbalances 
needs to be distinguished from potential meningoencephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, 
viral, or fungal) or progression of malignancy, or secondary to a paraneoplastic process.  
All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with a CT 
scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation, or edema. If 
deemed safe by [CONTACT_1963], a lumbar puncture should be performed and a neurologist  should  be consulted.  Patients  with signs  and symptoms  of meningoencephalitis,  in 
the absence of an identified alternate etiology,  should be treated  according  to the guidelines  in 
Table 9- 13.

9.14.12  Systemic  Immune  Activation  
 
Systemic immune activation  (SIA)  is a rare condition characterized by [CONTACT_33471]. Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, SIA is considered a potential  
risk when  given in combination with other  immunomodulating agents.  SIA should be included in 
the differential diagnosis for patients who, in the absence of an alternative etiology, develop a 
sepsis -like syndrome after administration of atezolizumab, and the initial evaluation should 
include the following:  
• CBC with peripheral smear  
• PT, PTT,  fibrinogen,  and D- dimer  
• Ferritin  
• Triglycerides  
• AST,  ALT,  and total bilirubin  
• LDH

intercourse) or use 2 contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during 
the treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_1252557] dose of study treatment.  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is between menarche and 
menopause  and has not been permanently  or surgically  sterilized  and is capable of procreation. 
Permanent sterilization includes hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy and/or bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_893901]. This definition also includes women who have experienced menopause onset < 12 months prior to enrollment.  
Examples  of single  contraceptive methods  with a failure  rate of < 1% per year include bilateral 
tubal ligation, male sterilization, and copper intrauterine devices.  
The reliability  of sexual  abstinence should be evaluated in relation  to the duration of the clinical 
trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
Patients should be informed that taking the study dug may involve unknown risks to the fetus 
(unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate in the study 
they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above)  for the duration of the 
study and for at least [ADDRESS_1252558]:  Entinostat

10.2.2  Electrocardiograms 
 
All patients will undergo a 12- lead ECG during screening; pre- dose (i.e., before entinostat and 
atezolizumab) on C3D1, and then every 3 cycles thereafter. A 12- lead ECG also is to be 
repeated  as clinically  indicated  during treatment  and again at the EOT visit (within  [ADDRESS_1252565] dose).  
ECGs  will be recorded after the patient  has rested  in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683]  10 minutes  in 
each case.  The Investigator or designated physician will review the paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_893913] 12 -lead ECGs when they are collected.  
 
10.2.3  Vital  Signs  
 
Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), pulse (beats per  minut e), 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (breaths  per minute),  and temperature,  are to be measured  during screening, 
on D1 of each treatment cycle, at the EOT ([ADDRESS_1252566] dose) and the Safety F/U visits.  
Measurements  are to be made after the patient  has been  resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_576466] a 
minimum of 5 minutes.  
Blood pressure and pulse will be measured using a blood pressure recording device with an 
appropriately sized cuff. The units ( °F or ° C) and mode of temperature recording will be 
documented  (e.g.,  oral, axillary);  the same  units  and mode  should  be used  for a patient  across 
all measurements. Height will be collected at the screening visit only.

documented  through  90 days  following  cessation  of treatment,  or 30 days  after the initiation  of a 
new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier. 
10.3 Efficacy  Assessments  
With the exception of OS, all efficacy endpoints in this trial (including the primary endpoint in 
Phase 2) are linked  to the tumor  response  assessments  and therefore  the importance  of timely 
and complete  disease assessments in this study  cannot  be understated.  Failure  to perform  any 
of the required disease assessments will result in the inability to determine disease status for 
that time point.  Frequent  off schedule or incomplete disease assessments  have the potential  to 
weaken the conclus ion of this clinical trial.  
The schedule of tumor burden assessments should be fixed according to the calendar, 
regardless of treatment interruptions. Tumor burden assessments will be performed until 
progressive  disease  as per RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_1252569], at the discretion of the investigator.  
The same  method of assessment  and the same  technique used  for study  screening (CT scan  or 
MRI)  to characterize each lesion  must be used  at each subsequent  post-screening assessment. 
Post-screening scans and the corresponding overall tumor assessment (according to RECIST 
and irRECIST) should be done at the next visit after the scans are performed and prior to indicating the subsequent cycle, to rule out progressive disease that would warrant study treatment discontinuation.  
 
10.3.1  Tumor  Measurements and Disease Response  Assessment  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor  Measurement  and Assessment  
Initial tumor imaging at screening must be performed within 28 days prior to initial study drug dosing (C1D1).  (Scans  performed  as part of routine clinical management  are acceptable for use 
as initial tumor imaging if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days prior to C1D1 and can be assessed by [CONTACT_11343].)  Patients will have radiological 
disease assessments performed every 6 weeks (+/ -3 days) (Week 6, Week 12, etc.) during 
study treatment through week [ADDRESS_1252570]:  Entinostat  
Protocol  Numbe r: SNDX -275-0602  (TRIO025)

occurred by [CONTACT_5875] 36, radiological assessments will be then be done every 9 weeks (+/ -3 days) 
until progressive disease. If a patient comes off study for reasons other than progressive 
disease, radiological assessments will continue on this same study schedule until progressive disease is unequivocally  documented.  Images  should be kept to the calendar  schedule and not 
be delayed for delays in cycles or study drug administration. Disease response in target and non-target lesions will be assessed locally by [CONTACT_226832] 1.[ADDRESS_1252571]  1.1 that has been radiologically  documented  within  28 days  prior to initiating  study 
drug treatment, defined as follows:

Target  versus non-target  
 
• Target:  all measurable lesions  up to a maximum  of 2 lesions  per organ  and 5 lesions  in 
total, representative of all involved organs, are to be identified as target lesions and 
measured and recorded at screening. Target lesions are to be selected on the basis of 
their size (i.e., those with the longest diameter) and suitability for accurate repeated measurement. The sum of the diameters for all target lesions is to be calculated and recorded on the eCRF as the sum of the longest diameters. 
• Non-target:  all other lesions not classified as target lesions (or sites of disease) are to 
be identif ied as non-target  lesions  and are to be recorded on the eCRF. Measurement  of 
non-target lesions is not required.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Scan Procedures  
Contrast -enhanced CT scans of chest, abdomen, and, as clinically indicated, pelvis are 
preferred for evaluation of disease  status for this study;  however,  a contrast -enhanced MRI can 
also be performed  if a patient  has or develops  allergy  to iodinated contrast  agents.  The imaging 
modality used at screening should continue for all images during study participation, unless 
clinically contra -indicated.  
Positron emission tomography (PET) alone will not be acceptable as part of the imaging to be performed for this study. If PET is performed, the Investigator should not remove any patient based on PET alone,  as there can be false  positives.  If he/she thinks  a patient  has progressed 
via PET, it must be confirmed with a CT/MRI.  
If a combined 18F -deoxyglucose (FDG) PET- CT scan is performed, the CT portion of that 
examination should not be substituted for the dedicated CT examinations required by [CONTACT_893955] -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral 
contrast).  
Product:  Entinostat  
Protocol  Numbe r: SNDX -275-0602  (TRIO025) 
Date:  [ADDRESS_1252577] scans  according to the parameters  below:  
 
• Use consistent scan parameters (spacing, thickness, field of view, etc.) for all 
assessments. Any alternate  imaging or parameter  variation from the protocol  should be 
noted.  
• If a patient  develops  hypersensitivity  to the iodinated contrast  medium  while  on study,  it 
is acceptable to perform chest CT scans without contrast. In addition, a contrast - 
enhanced MRI scan according to the  parameters described  in the MRI section must  be 
performed for the remainder of the required anatomy.  
• The patient  should be given oral contras t (as either  positive [e.g., barium  or Gastrografin] 
or negative [e.g., water or saline] contrast media, according to site standard of care)  
prior to the examination to allow for sufficient bowel opacification.  
• Non-ionic iodinated IV contrast  with a minimu m of 320 mg iodine/mL should be used  for 
this study.  Contrast  agent  volume should be according to the package insert.  The same 
contrast agent with the same concentration should be used throughout the study.  
MRI Scan Procedures 
• If IV contrast  is medically  contraindicated  during the study,  a dynamic  contrast -enhanced 
MRI is an acceptable alternative to CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis.  
• MRI must be performed using either 1.5T or 3.0T scanner. A change in scanner field 
strength  is not allowed  for an individual  patient  while  on study  (e.g.,  if a patient  has a C2 
MRI scan at 3.0T, all subsequent scans must be performed at 3.0T).  
• MRI scans should use optimized parameters to decrease motion artifact and maximize 
signal -to-noise ratio and resolution.  Breath -hold imaging,  fast-scanning techniques,  and 
gadolinium should be used to maximize lesion identification. Note: A non- contrast CT 
scan of the chest or digital chest X- ray must be acquired in addition to the MRI of the 
abdomen and, as applicable, pelvis.  
• The patient  must  undergo scanning with approved extracellular  contrast  media only 
(e.g., Magnevist, Dataram, Omniscan).

• The same equipment, field strength, sequences, scanning parameters, positioning, 
angulation, timing, field of view, and slice thickness should be utilized for all 
examinations  acquired  both pre- and post-contrast  for a given  patient  over the course  of 
the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Disease Response Assessment  Criteria  
Patients will have radiological disease assessments performed every 6 weeks (+/ -3 days) 
(Week 6, Week 12, etc.) during study treatment through week 36 or until unequivocal 
progressive disease.  If progressive disease has not occurred by [CONTACT_5875] 36, radiological 
assessments will be then be done every  9 weeks (+/ -3 days) until unequivocal progressive 
disease.  Images  should be kept to the calendar  schedule and not be delayed for missed study 
drug administration.  
Partial  or complete  response  should be confirmed  by a repeat  tumor  imaging  assessment  not 
less than [ADDRESS_1252578] indication of 
response, or at the next scheduled scan if on a 6 week  schedule, whichever is clinically 
indicated.  
In subjects who discontinue study therapy without doc umented unequivocal progressive 
disease, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by [CONTACT_893956]  6 weeks  until (1) unequivocal  progressive disease (2) death,  or (3) the end of the 
study, whichever occurs  first. All scans will be submitted (electronically whenever possible) to a

Date:  [ADDRESS_1252580] (irRECIST) (Appendix 4) will be utilized to account for the unique 
tumor response characterist ics seen with atezolizumab treatment.  Immunotherapeutic agents 
such as atezolizumab may produce antitumor effects by [CONTACT_134981] - 
specific immune responses. The response patterns seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_893917],  and a clinical response 
may manifest after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions.  
Patients with a first radiological evidence of progressive disease, should continue on study 
treatment, at the discretion of the investigator,  until confirmed progressive disease is 
determined per irRECIST  in a subsequent  scan. Therefore,  the following  process  for assessing 
radiological progressive disease will be used in this study:  
1. If radiologic imaging demonstrates initial evidence for PD, tumor assessment should be 
repeated at the earliest of 4 weeks, or preferably on the study schedule of 6 weeks, in order to confirm PD.  Treatment on -study may be continued while awaiting radiologic 
confirmation of progression. This clinical decision should be based on the patient’s overall  clinical condition,  including performance status,  clinical symptoms, and laboratory 
data.  
2. Specifically,  it is recommended that patients  continue to receive study  drug while  waiting 
for confirmation of PD if they are clinically stable as defined by:  
• Absence of signs  and symptoms  indicating PD. 
• No decline in ECOG  performance status.  
• Absence of rapid PD. 
• Absence of progressive tumor  at critical anatomical  sites (e.g.,  cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.  
As per irRECIST, if repeat imaging does not show irPD, then PD by [CONTACT_893959].  If repeat  imaging confirms  irPD, PD will have 
been confirmed and the patient will be discontinued from study treatment.

NOTE: If a subject has  confirmed radiographic progression (i.e. [ADDRESS_1252582] 4 weeks apart 
demonstrating progressive disease),  but the subject  is achieving a clinically  meaningful  benefit, 
and there is no further increase in the tumor burden at the confirmatory tumor imaging, an 
exception to continue treatment may be considered following consultation with the Medical 
Monitor. In this case, if treatment is continued, tumor imaging should continue to be performed 
following the study required intervals per Table 1-[ADDRESS_1252583] repeat imaging for confirmation of PD 
and should come off study treatment.  
 
 
10.4 Protein Lysine  Acetylation and Immune  Correlates 
Based on preclinical studies it is suggested that entinostat may specifically target a population  
of MDSCs and thus improve the response to PD1 or PDL1 antibody treatment. The Sponsor 
plans to evaluate populations of MDSC and other myeloid cells in peripheral blood and tumor tissues  of the patients  (if available)  and also to evaluate the basic  T-cell function in patients,  with 
the expectation that if  MDSC level is decreased the response to antigens would be improved.

Please refer to the current  Informed Consent  and the Investigator’s  Brochure for the current 
safety profile and information regarding atezolizumab.  
12.2 Adverse  Event  Definitions 
 
12.2.1  Adverse Events  
 
An AE is defined in the International Council for  Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject  administered a pharmaceutical  product  and which  does  not necessarily  have a causal 
relationship with this treatment” ( ICH E6:1.2 ). 

Product:  Entinostat

CONFIDENTIAL  SYNDAX  PHARMACEUTICALS   
  
 
Worsening of a pre-existing  medical  condition,  (i.e., diabetes,  migraine headaches,  gout)  should 
be considered an AE if there is either an increase in severity, frequency, or duration of the 
condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes.  
Interventions  for pretreatment  conditions  (i.e., elective  cosmetic  surgery)  or medical  procedures 
that were planned before study enrollment are not considered AEs.  
PD should not be recorded  as an AE. If PD occurs, record  the date first documented  in the EOT 
visit eCRF. Also record all methods of assessment, i.e., 1 target/non -target lesion, tumor 
response assessment, and/or clinical disease assessment. Indicate if the patient starts new 
treatment.  
In the case of death,  record “Fatal”  for only the event  causing death.  AEs that are ongoing at the 
end of the study or time of death are to be noted as “not recovered/not resolved.” Classification 
of AEs is to be done by [CONTACT_893962], version 4.03. The 
Death eCRF must also be completed.  
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual patient represents a significant change from baseline. In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator’s judgment)  should not be recorded as AEs;  however,  laboratory  value changes  requiring therapy 
or adjustment in prior therapy are considered AEs.  
 
12.2.2  Suspected Adverse  Reaction 
 
A suspected adverse  reaction is any AE for which  there  is a reasonable possibility  that the drug 
caused the adverse event. For the purposes of regulatory safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse react ion, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
 
12.2.3  Unexpected Adverse Event  
 
An unexpected AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it  is not listed  in 
the Investigator  Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity that has been observed;  or, 
if an Investigator Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk  information

described in the General  Investigational Plan or elsewhere in the current  application,  as 
amended.  
 
12.2.4  Serious  Adverse  Events 
 
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction is considered “serious”  if, in the view of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• is fatal 
• is life-threatening (i.e., places  the patient  at immediate  risk of death)  
• requires  in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]  
• results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
• is a significant  medical  hazard,  such as new malignancy  
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37349] “serious” is any in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256170] a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility. Any AE that 
does  not meet  one of the definitions  of serious  (i.e., emergency  room  visit, out-patient  surgery, 
or requires urgent investigation) may be considered by [CONTACT_139666] “other 
significant medical hazard” criterion for classification as a serious adverse event (SAE).  
12.3 Reporting  Procedures for All Adverse  Events 
 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs (as defined in Section 12.2) observed 
by [CONTACT_893963]’  medical  records 
and reported in the Adverse Event eCRF.  
The following  AE attributes  must  be assigned  by [CONTACT_737]:  event  description (with  detail 
appropriate to the event); seriousness; dates of onset and resolution; severity; assessment of 
relatedness to entinostat and to atezolizumab; and the action taken. The Investigator may be asked to provide follow -up information, discharge summaries, and extracts from medical 
records.  
If applicable,  the study  drug relationship  will be assessed by [CONTACT_893964]:  “Is there  a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_893965]:  Entinostat

with atezolizumab?”  The causal  relation  between  an AE and the study  drug will be determined 
by [CONTACT_893966]:  
 
• Related: event  can be fully explained by [CONTACT_893967]  
 
• Possibly related : event  may be explained by [CONTACT_893968],  or by

• Unlikely related: event  is most  likely  to be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s  clinical state  or 
other agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
 
• Not related : event  can be fully explained by [CONTACT_102]’s  clinical state  or other 
agents/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893918], the 
following should be considered: follows a temporal sequence from administration of investigational product is a known response to the investigational product based on clinical or 
preclinical data could not be explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical 
state, environmental or toxic factors,  or other therapy administered to the  patient disappears or 
decreases  upon cessation or reduction of dose of investigational product  reappears  or worsens 
when investigational product is reinstated. 
 
Whenever  possible,  the CTCAE,  version 4.03,  should be used  for assessing the severity  of AEs 
(https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03/CTCAE_4.03_2010- 06- 
14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf).  
 
For AEs that are not adequately  addressed  in the NCI CTCAE,  the standard severity grading 
scale may be used ( Table 12-1 ).

1 Mild: Aware  of sign or symptom,  but easily  tolerated.  
 
2 Moderate:  Discomfort  enough  to cause interference  with usual  activity.  
 
3 Severe:  Incapacitating  with inability  to work  or do usual  activity.  
 
4 Life-Threatening:   Refers  to an event  in which  the patient  was, in the view of 
the Investigator,  at risk of death  at the time of the event. 
(This category is not to be used for an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
 
5 Fatal:  Event  resulted  in death.  
 
  
 
It will be left to the Investigator’s clinical judgment to determine whether an AE is related and of 
sufficient severity to require the patient’s removal from treatment or from the study. A patient 
may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he/she perceives as an intolerable AE. If either  of these  situations  arises, the patient  should be strongly  encouraged to undergo  an 
end-of-study assessment and be under medical supervision until symptoms cease or the 
condition becomes stable.

12.4.1  Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting Procedures 
 
Although pregnancy  and lactation are not considered AEs,  it is the  responsibility  of Investigators 
or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a patient (spontaneously reported to 
them) that occurs during the study or within [ADDRESS_1252594] be followed to the completion/termination of the

[CONTACT_893969] a continuous  basis. Note:  All serious  adverse  events  must 
be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of discovery or notification of the event.  No formal

Date:  [ADDRESS_1252604] Phase 1 dose- 
finding scheme.  The total number  of patients  to be enrolled in the dose  determination phase is 
dependent upon the observed safety profile, which will determine the number of patients per 
dose cohort, as well as the number of dose adjustments required to achieve either the MTD or the recommended Phase 2 dose. Therefore between 6 and 18 patients will be included in the Dose Determination Phase 1 part.  Note: patients who discontinued the  study for reasons other 
than study drug related toxicities before completing cycle 1 may be replaced.  
A starting  sample  size of 3 evaluable patients  per dose cohort,  expanding  to 6 in the event  of a 
marginal  DLT rate (33%)  was deemed  to be a safe and conventional  approach in dose- finding. 
Assuming a true DLT rate of 5% or less, there would be a 3% chance that dose escalation would be halted in a given cohort (i.e., observing 2 or more patients with DLT).  If a true DLT 
rate of 50% is assumed, then there would be an 83% chance that dose escalation would be halted in a given cohort.  
 
13.1.2  Expansion Phase 
 
The Expansion Phase will evaluate the efficacy and safety of entinostat when administered at the recommended Phase 2 dose with atezolizumab in a randomized, double- blind, placebo- 
controlled setting.  Up to 70 eligible  patients  with metastatic  TNBC will be randomized  to receive 
atezolizumab with entinostat or placebo in a 1:1 allocation.  
The true median PFS for patients with aTNBC receiving atezolizumab monotherapy is expected to be approximately 4 months from the initiation of such treatment.  It is hypothesized that the 
combination of entinostat and atezolizumab will improve true median P FS by 3 months (i.e., 
from 4 to 7 months).  Under the exponential distribution, such an improvement in median PFS 
represents  a reduction of 43% for the true PFS failure  hazard rate or equivalently,  a hazard ratio 
of 0.57.  Inferential comparisons will be performed using a stratified log- rank test, stratifying on 
the randomization stratification factor of geographic location.  Total information of [ADDRESS_1252605]:  Entinostat

without  documented progressive disease beforehand,  is estimated  to provide 80% power  to 
detect a 43% reduction in the PFS failure hazard rate with 1 -sided significance level of 0.1 
(SEQDESIGN procedure, SAS version 9.2).  
Assuming approximately 9 months of accrual and an additional 9 months of follow -up, total 
accrual of 70 patients (approximately 35 per treatment arm) is projected to result in [ADDRESS_1252606]  
1.1 will continue to undergo disease assessments  until the earlier  of documented progressive 
disease, death, or withdrawal of consent/lost to  follow- up. It is anticipated that the number of 
patients who will drop out of the study without PFS failure beforehand will be low (2– 3%). 
Depending on the actual number of such dropouts, the number of patients accrued may be increased by  6–10 additional patients to accommodate for a higher -than-expected number of 
dropouts.  
13.2 Phase 2 Interim  Efficacy Analyses 
The sample size and number  of PFS failures  were  adjusted using  the O’Brien  
 
-Fleming group sequential procedure to account for 1 planned interim analysis of PFS after 45 
events  (75%  information).  It is projected that 75% and 100%  of total information will be reported 
at approximately 12 and 18 months, respectively. 
The interim  analysis  will be performed  to support  the Sponsor’s  product  development  plans  and 
ongoing resourcing activities. Although  there  are no plans  to terminate  the study  early  because 
of early evidence of superior efficacy for the combination treatment, the significance levels at 
the interim analysis and final analysis will be adjusted to maintain control of the overall type I 
error rate for multiple testing of PFS ( O’Brien 1979).

13.3 Populations  for Analysis 
The Ful l  Analysis  Set (FAS)  will serve as the primary  population  for the analysis  of PFS and 
other  efficacy- related endpoints  in the Phase 2 portion of the study.  The FAS will include  all 
patients who undergo randomization, irrespective of the actual receipt of study treatment.  
Patients  will  be grouped  for analysis  according  to the treatment  arm to which  they were 
randomized.  
The Pe r -protocol  Analysis  Set is for various  supportive  analyses  that may be performed;  this 
excludes patients with important deviations that may substantially affect the results of the 
primary efficacy analyses. The final determination on protocol violations, and thereby [CONTACT_893971]-protocol  set, will be made  prior to locking  the clinical database  will be 
documented in a separate memo.  
The Safety Analysis Set  wi
 ll be used for the analysis of safety data  in both the Phase 1b and 
Phase [ADDRESS_1252607] 1 dose of entinostat and atezolizumab is required for inclusion in the analysis of a specific safety parameter.  To assess change from baseline, a 
baseline measurement is also required.  
A patient that experiences an AE meeting DLT criteria during Cycle 1 or who receives the full dos
e of atezolizumab  and all doses  of entinostat  during Cycle  1 without  experiencing a DLT,  is 
considered a DLT- evaluable patient.  
13.4 Study Endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the Phase 1b Dose Determination portion of the study is the recommended Phase 2 dose  as assessed by [CONTACT_893972].  
The endpoints  of the randomized Phase  2 Expansion portion of the study  are as follows:

13.5 Statistical Methods 
 
13.5.1  General  
 
The statistical  analyses  performed  for this study  will be presented  by [CONTACT_208885].  For the Dose 
Determination phase, tabulations will be provided by [CONTACT_178895].  For the 
expansion phase, tabulations will be provided by [CONTACT_2939].  Some analyses may be 
performed based on both phases combined. 
The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 9.2 or later (SAS Institute Inc, 
Cary NC).  Programming specifications will be prepared which describe the datasets and 
variables  created  for this study.  The datasets  will be prepared  using the most  recent  version  of 
CDISC’s Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) and Analysis Dataset Model (ADaM).  The

CONFIDENTIAL  SYNDAX  PHARMACEUTICALS   
  
 
source  SDTM  and ADaM  datasets  from which  a statistical analysis  is performed  (including 
interim reviews) will be archived with the Sponsor.  
 
13.5.2  Patient  Disposition 
 
The number  of patients  included in each  analysis  set will be summarized,  along with the reason 
for any exclusions.  Patients discontinuing from study treatment and/or withdrawing from study 
participation the primary reason for discontinuation will be summarized.  
 
13.5.3  Demographics  and Characteristics  
 
Descriptive  summaries  of demographic  and screening characteristics will be tabulated for each 
study phase.  
 
13.5.4  Extent  of Exposure 
 
The overall duration of study treatment administration and number of cycles initiated will be 
tabulated for each patient and summarized for each study phase.  For each patient, the 
cumulative doses administered (in mg) of both entinostat and atezolizumab will be calculated. These data will be further summarized for each dose cohort (or treatment arm) by [CONTACT_61187],  standard  deviation,  median,  and range  of these  values.  The number  and proportion 
of patients  with one or more  dose  modifications  (i.e., reduction  or delay)  will be tabulated  along 
with the reason for modification.  
 
13.5.5  Efficacy  Analyses  
 
Efficacy analyses  will be conducted using  the Full Analysis  Set and, where  appropriate,  the Per- 
protocol Set.  With the exception of PFS, all hypothesis testing will be assessed using a one- 
sided significance level of 0.1.  The Lan- DeMets alpha spending function with an O’Brien- 
Fleming type boundary will be used to control the overall type I error for multiple testing of PFS. The boundary will be derived based on the actual number of PFS failures reported for each analysis.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is duration of PFS, defined as the number of months from randomiza tion to the earlier of progressive disease or death due to any cause. Disease 
assessments will continue until progressive  disease,  even  after the  originally  assigned study 
treatment  is discontinued.  For purposes  of analysis,  one month  is considered 30.[ADDRESS_1252609]:  Entinostat  
Protocol  Numbe r: SNDX -275-0602  (TRIO025) 
Date:  11 Sep 2018  Page  123 of 141 
CONFIDENTIAL  SYNDAX  PHARMACEUTICALS   
  
 
The duration of PFS will be summarized  descriptively  using the Kaplan- Meier  method  with 95% 
confidence intervals calculated using Greenwood’s formula.  Inferential comparisons between 
treatment arms will be made using the stratified log rank test, stratifying on the randomization 
stratification factor of geographic location. Estimation of the hazard ratio for treatment effect 
and its corresponding 95% confidence interval will be determined using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, without any other covariate.  Homogeneity in the hazard ratios 
between randomization strata will be examined by [CONTACT_863215]’s test. The corresponding results 
without stratification will be reported as supplemental analyses.  The adequacy of the Cox 
model will be evaluated, including an assessment of the proportional hazards assumption 
(Therneau 2000).  
 
For the interim  and primary  analyses,  PFS will be right-censored for patients  who meet  one or 
more of the following conditions:  
• Patients  with no screening or post-screening disease assessments  unless  death 
occurred prior to the first planned assessment (in which case the death will be 
considered a PFS event)  
• Patients  who initiate  subsequent  anticancer  therapy  in the absence  of documented 
progression  
• Patients  who die or have  progressive  disease  after missing  2 or more  consecutively 
scheduled disease assessment visits  
• Patients  who are last known  to be alive and progression- free on or before  the data cut- 
off date 
 
For such patients,  the progression or censoring date will be determined  based on described 
conventions  (FDA 2007).  Sensitivity  analyses  will be performed to assess  the impact  of the 
different censoring mechanisms and deviations from the planned schedule of disease 
assessments ( Bhattacharya 2009 ; Stone 2011 ). 
ORR will be estimated based on the crude proportion of patients in each treatment arm whose best overall  response during the course of study  treatment  is CR or PR. Tumor  response  will be 
assessed using irRECIST.  Approximate 95% confidence intervals will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_893974].  The inferential  comparison of the observed ORRs  will be made 
using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel chi -square test, stratified by [CONTACT_281272]. The corresponding results without stratification will be reported as supplemental 
analyses.

DOR will be calculated for patients who achieve CR or PR.  For such patients, DOR is defined 
as the number  of months  from the start date of PR or CR (whichever  response  occurs first) and 
subsequently confirmed, to the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is documented. 
The date of progression or censoring for DOR will be determined using the conventions described for PFS.  DOR will be summar ized descriptively for each treatment arm using the 
Kaplan- Meier method.  Inferential comparisons between treatment arms for DOR are not 
planned.  
CBR will be estimated based on the crude proportion of patients in each treatment arm whose best overall response during the course of study treatment is CR, PR, or stable disease lasting for at least [ADDRESS_1252610] met. The analysis  of CBR and its duration will be 
based on the methods described above for ORR and DOR, respectively.  
OS is defined as the number of months from randomization to the date of death (due to any cause).  Patients  who are alive or lost to follow- up as of a data analysis  cutoff date will be right- 
censored.  The censoring  date will be determined from the patients’  date of last contact  [CONTACT_893975], whichever date occurs first.  The analysis of OS will be based on the 
methods described above for PFS.  
 
13.5.[ADDRESS_1252611]. 
Summary tables and listings will be provided for  all reported Treatment Emergent Adverse 
Events  (TEAEs),  defined  as AEs that start on or after the first administration of study  treatment. 
The reported AE term will be assigned a standardized preferred term using the current version 
of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
TEAEs  will be summarized  based  on the number  and percentage  of patients  experiencing the 
event by [CONTACT_11189] (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  In the event a patient

tabulations.  
Tabular  summaries  will be provided for: 
 
• all TEAEs  
• TEAEs  by [CONTACT_893976] 
• TEAEs  with action of study  treatment  delayed/interrupted or dose reduced 
• TEAEs  with action of study  treatment  discontinued 
• SAEs  
 
For the escalation  phase,  the observed DLT rate in each  dose  cohort  will be calculated  by [CONTACT_893977] a 2- sided 95% exact binomial CI.  
All deaths that occur on study (defined as during treatment or within 30 days of treatment discontinuation)  will be reported  in a patient  listing,  which  will include the primary  cause of death 
and the number of days between the date of the last dose of study drug and death.  
Hematology  and serum  chemistries  will be summarized  in a descriptive manner  by [CONTACT_178898], standard deviation, median, and range as follows:  
• baseline value  
• minimum  post baseline value  
• maximum  post baseline value  
• average post baseline value  
• last post baseline value 
 
Laboratory values will be assigned toxicity grades when available using the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  Directional shifts in laboratory 
toxicity grades (comparing baseline grade with worst post -baseline grade) will be analyzed 
using standard shift tables, presenting number and proportion of patients and their maximum 
grade shift.  For analytes without a toxicity grading scale, the shift table will present directional 
shifts  from baseline  to above or below  the laboratory  standard normal  range using the maximum 
increase and/or decrease observed throughout the course of treatment/observation.

deviation, median, and range in the same manner described for laboratory values.  
ECG results will be listed and summarized in terms of the number and percentage of patients 
with abnormal  and normal  findings,  as reported by [CONTACT_737],  at the time points  assessed 
(screening and EOT).  
Prior  and concomitant  medications  will be coded  to generic  term using the current  version  of the 
World Health Organization Drug Dictionary and will be tabulated and listed by [CONTACT_4676].  
 
13.5.7  Pharmacokinetic  and Antidrug  Antibody  Analyses 
 
A population PK analysis will be used to describe the PK of entinostat. The effects of patient 
factors  (e.g.,  demographics,  clinical chemistries,  disease)  on entinostat  PK will be evaluated.  In 
addition, the relationship between entinostat  exposure parameters and indicators of safety will 
be assessed.  
Specific  details  for these  analyses  as well as analyses  of trough atezolizumab levels  and anti- 
atezolizumab antibodies will be provided in a separate analysis plan.  
 
13.5.[ADDRESS_1252614] deviation,  median,  25th percentile (first quartile),  75th percentile (third 
quartile), minimum, and maximum values will be presented. For discrete data, the frequency 
and percent distribution will be presented.  The Wilcoxon signed rank test (for within- treatment 
comparisons) and Wilcoxon rank sum test (for between- treatment comparisons) will  be used to 
identify any systematic changes in biomarker levels from baseline.  Additionally, the correlation 
among the various  initial immune correlate  values  may be assessed by [CONTACT_893978]’s 
correlation coefficient.  Analysis of covariance models may be used to explore the relationship 
between changes in immune correlates and selected measures of antineoplastic activity (e.g., maximum change from baseline in the sum of product diameters in measurable les ions).  The 
association among the various immune correlates and clinical outcomes (data permitting) may 
be explored using heat map and other data visualization techniques.

17.4 Appendix  4: Immune -related  Response Criteria  Derived from  RECIST  1.1 (irRECIST)  
 
Increasing clinical experience indicates  that traditional  response criteria  may not be sufficient  to 
fully characterize activity in this new era of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or biologics.  This is 
particularly true for immunotherapeutic agents such as anti -CTLA -4 and anti -PD1\anti PDL1 
which exert the antitumor activity by [CONTACT_893988] T cells, thus 
leading to tumor infiltration by T cells and tumor regression rather than direct cytotoxic effects 
(Hoos 2010; Hodi 2008).  Clinical observatio ns of patients with advanced melanoma treated 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], for example, suggested that conventional response assessment criteria such 
as RECIST and WHO criteria are not sufficient to fully characterize pattercccns of tumor 
response to immunotherapy  because tumors  treated with immunotherapeutic  agents  may show 
additional response patterns that are not described in these conventional criteria (Hoos 2010; Nishino 2014).  
 
Furthermore, the conventional tumor assessment criteria (RECIST and WHO criteria) have  
been reported  as not capturing the existence of a subset  of patients  who have  an OS similar  to 
those who have experienced CR or PR but were flagged as PD by [CONTACT_56649] (Hoos 2010; 
Nishino 2012).  
 
On these  grounds,  a tumor  assessment  system has been developed that incorporates  these 
delayed or flare -type responses into the RECIST 1.1 criteria (irRECIST; Nishino 2014). .  
 
Lesion measurability  and baseline selection  of lesions:  
 
The RECIST 1.1 definitions for measurable and non- measurable lesions apply. At baseline, all 
tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non -measurable. For target 
lesions, a Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline TMTB  (similarly  to the Sum of Diameters  in RECIST  1.1). The baseline 
TMTB will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor response in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
 
New lesions:  
 
irRECIST  do not necessarily  score the appearance of new lesions as  progressive disease.  Also, 
new lesions  should be categorized as measurable or non-measurable (same  measurability  rules 
as RECIST 1.1. apply).  
 
In order  to be selected as new measurable  lesions  (≤ 2 lesions  per organ,  ≤ 5 lesions  total,  per 
timepoint), new lesions must meet criteria as defined for baseline target lesion selection and meet  the same  minimum  size requirements  of [ADDRESS_1252628]:  Entinostat  
Protocol  Numbe r: SNDX -275-0602  (TRIO025) 
Date:  [ADDRESS_1252629] baseline tumor  assessments:  
- TMTB:  At each  post-baseline assessment  the TMTB  is defined as the sum of: 
o Longest  diameters  of all non-nodal  target  lesions  
o Longest  diameters  of all NEW  non-nodal  measurable lesions  
o Short  axis of all nodal  target  lesions  
o Short  axis of all NEW  nodal  measurable lesions  
- Non-target  lesions/New  Non-measurable lesions:  the RECIST  1.1 definitions  for the 
assessment of non- target lesions apply (irCR; irNN, irPD).  
 
Overall  response at each time point:  
 
- Immune- related complete response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all lesions 
(whether  measurable  or not) and no new lesions.  All measurable lymph  nodes  also 
must have a reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
- Immune- related partial response (irPR): Decrease of ≥ 30% in TMTB relative to 
baseline,  non-target  lesions  are irNN,  and no unequivocal  progression of new non- 
measurable lesions  
- Immune- related  stable disease (irSD):  Failure  to meet  criteria  for irCR or irPR in the 
absence of irPD.  
- Immune- related  progressive disease (irPD):  Minimum  20% increase  and minimum  5 mm 
absolute increase in TMTB compared to nadir, or irPD for non -target or new non- 
measurable lesions.  
- irNE (Not evaluable):  used  in exceptional  cases  where insufficient  data exists.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  6 of 142 • A safety follow-up period: where a safety follow-up telephone contact (TC) will occur 
2 weeks ( ±4 days) after the subject’s last dose of treatment (end -of-treatment [EOT]) or 
premature discontinuation visit (PDV) . 
 
The end -of-study is defined as the last visit of the last subject undergoing the study, therefore 
end-of-study will occur when the last subject has completed his or her post-study follow-up 
TC. Subjects who discontinue IP will complete a PDV, and adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed up if medically indicated. 
Investigational Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration  
BDA MDI is formulated as both micronized budesonide and micronized albuterol 
co-suspended with spray-dried porous particles in a hydrofluoroalkane propellant. The 
co-suspension formulation ensures that subjects receive a consistent delivery of the drug from 
each actuation of the MDI.  
Only Sponsor-provided IP administered 4 times per day (QID) and Sponsor- provided Ventolin 
to be used in response to asthma symptoms are allowed during the study. No other asthma 
medications are allowed during the study. 
At randomization (Visit 2), adult (≥18 years of age) and adoles cent subjects (aged 12 - 17 
years , where approved ) who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 
following 5 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio : 
• BDA MDI 80/180 μg QID (given as 2 actuations of BDA MDI 40/90 μg per puff)  
• BDA MDI 160/180 μg QID (given as 2 actuations of BDA MDI 80/90 μg per puff)  
• BD MDI 160 μg QID (given as 2 actuations of BD MDI 80 μg per puff)  
• AS MDI 180 μg QID (given as 2 actuations of AS MDI 90 μg per puff)  
• Placebo MDI  QID (given as 2 actuations) 
 The maxim um daily dosage of IP should not exceed [ADDRESS_342446] the investigator if their symptoms necessitate more than 8 puffs  of Ventolin  in a 
day.  
Statisti cal M ethods  
Sample Size Calculation  
A preliminary sample size calculation was based on historical trial data. A sample size of 
600 subjects  was initially proposed to provide 93% power to detect a difference in change

Budesonide/ Albuterol (BDA) – AV004  [ADDRESS_342447] deviation of 210 mL obtained from the placebo MDI group of Study 
PT008001 and an assumed dropout rate of 10% and 15% for active and placebo treatment group, respectively, prior to Week 12.  
Because the assumed variability from the lung function data has a large impact on the 
estimated sample size necessary to achieve a stated power, a blinded estimate of the variability 
of pre -dose trough FEV
1 at Week 12 was  calculated. The review was  performed once 44% of 
subjects  had completed Week 12, and prior to the 600th subject  being randomized. The pooled 
estimate of va riability  across treatment groups was  used to re- calculate the projected power .  
Decisions following the blinded sample size re -estimation  
The blinded sample size re-estimation was performed once 44% of subjects had completed 
Week 12.  Based on the blinded estimate of variability , approximately 1000 subjects are 
required in order to demonstrate 90% power. Consequently, the total number of randomiz ed 
adult and adolescent subjects has been increased by 400 to 1000. 
Randomization of approximately 200 subjects to each treatment group will provide 90% 
probability to detect a [ADDRESS_342448] deviation of 290 mL obtained 
from the blinded sample size re- estimation performed after 44% of subjects completed week 
12 and an estimated  overall dropout rate of 11% prior to Week 12. 
The sample size of 200 subjects per treatment group will also provide >99% probability to 
detect a 130 mL difference in FEV
1 AUC 0-6 hours over 12 weeks for comparison of BDA MDI 
versus BD MDI (effect sizes for AS MDI or BDA MDI versus placebo MDI should be 
considerably larger). This calculat ion assumes 2% dropout prior to Week [ADDRESS_342449] deviation of 290 mL obtained from the blinded sample size re-estimation performed 
after 44% of subjects completed W eek 12 . 
Approximately 1000 adults  (≥18 years of age)  and adolescent subjects (12  - 17 years of age, 
where approved ) with asthma will be randomized  1:1:1:1:1 to 1 of 5 treatment groups 
(approximately 200 subjects per group: BDA MDI 80/180 μg  QID , BDA MDI 160/180 μg 
QID, BD MDI 160 μg QID, AS MDI 180 μg  QID, o r placebo MDI ). In addition, where 
approved, up to 30 child subjects ( aged 4 to 11 years) with asthma will be enrolled  but will not 
receive high dose ICS and will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive low- dose BDA MDI  80/180 μg  
QID, AS MDI  180 μg QID,  or placebo  MDI . Approximately 2000 subjects will need to be 
screened, assuming an  estimated screen failure rate of approximately 50% prior to 
randomization. This Phase III study is planned to be conducted globally.

more accurately.  Final total e nroll ment in the study will be  confirmed following the second 
blinded sample size re -calculation  in order to ensure 90% power.  
The potential increase in sample size will be capped at 1300, a 30% increase above the revised 
number of [ADDRESS_342451] and seco nd dual-primary variables, change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-6 hours , and 
change from baseline in trough FEV 1 will each be analyzed using a repeated measures (RM) 
linear model  to compare treatment groups. The model will include baseline FEV 1, percentage 
reversibility to Ventolin , and age as continuous covariates, and visit, treatment, the treatment-
by-visit interaction , and prior ICS use (Yes/No) as categorical covariates. Baseline will be 
defined as the average of the pre-dose assessments coll ected on randomization (Visit 2) . 
An unstructured variance- covariance matrix will be implemented. If this model fails to 
converge, a heterogeneous Toeplitz (TOEPH) will be fit. Secondary E fficacy Analyses 
The median time to onset (defined as 15% increase i n FEV
1) over the pre -treatment value at 
randomization (Visit 2) will be compared among treatment groups using a Wilcoxon rank sum 
test. Confidence intervals for the median treatment difference will be calculated using the Hodges-Lehmann method. Descriptive  statistics for duration of response will be reported by 
[CONTACT_1570]. Only the subjects who achieve the 15% increase in FEV
[ADDRESS_342452] for change from baseline in ACQ -7 will be estimated using a mixed 
model RM  (MMRM) analysis. All data up to Week 12 will be included in the model, with 
terms for age,  treatment, visit, tr eatment* visit, prior ICS use (Yes/No), baseline ACQ -[ADDRESS_342453]-dose percent predicted FEV 1. Visit will be fitted as a categorical variable, 
and the variance -covariance matrix will be assumed to be unstructured. If the procedure does 
not converge, then a heterogeneous Toeplitz ( TOEPH) will be  used instead. This model will 
be used to give an overall assessment of the treatment effect as well as 95% confidence 
intervals.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  18 of 142 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background  
Bond Avillion 2 Development LP (Sponsor) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_280797]/albuterol sulfate (PT027; 
hereafter referred to as budesonide and albuterol sulfate [hereafter referred to as albuterol] 
metered -dose inhaler [BDA MDI]) pressurized inhalation suspension in adults and children 4 
years of age or older with asthma. Please refer to the current Investigator Brochure  for additional 
information. 
Albuterol is a short/rapid -acting β2-adrenoreceptor agonist (SABA), inducing airway smooth 
muscle relaxation and reducing or preventing bronchoconstriction. Albuterol is approved in 
many countries in multiple formulations for treatment or prevention of bronchoconstriction. In 
clinical practice, albuterol is used as  an as  needed (prn) reliever th erapy (Global Initiative  for 
Asthma  [GINA] 2018 ). Albuterol is approved in many countries as salbutamol in multiple 
formulations for the treatment or prevention of bronchoconstriction.  
Budesonide is a well-established anti- inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent 
glucocorticoid and weak mineralocorticoid activity and is approved worldwide in orally inhaled 
formulations for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease both as a 
mono-product and in combination with a long/rapid- acting β2-agonist (LABA, formoterol).  
In vitro studies have demonstrated that inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) agents potentiate the effects of SABAs in reducing airway smooth muscle tone ( Mendes 2008) and can reverse adrenergic 
receptor tolerance and  desensitization ( Cooper and Panettieri 2008). Clinically, similar functional 
potentiation with combined ICSs and albuterol has been observed in patients with asthma for functional measures of airway smooth muscle and airway blood flow ( Mendes 2015). An 
analysis of 425 asthma exacerbations in patients from the Formoterol and Corticosteroids Establishing Therapy International Study Group study ( Tattersfield 1999) revealed that asthma 
symptoms use were noted over several days before the start of an asthma exacerbation; increased reliever therapy  (ie, albuterol) followed a similar pattern, providing rapid bronchodilation to treat 
the symptoms. Combining albuterol with budesonide in the proposed BDA MDI combination product should not only provide rapid bronchodilation, but also treat worsening airway 
inflammation by [CONTACT_280850]. Per current treatment guidelines 
(GINA 2018 ), ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever can be used in patients with asthma. 
Studies of budesonide and a rapid -acting LABA (formoterol) as reliever therapy have 
demonstrated enhanced protection from severe exacerbatio ns in patients already receiving 
combination therapy for maintenance without an increase in adverse effects ( Rabe 2006; O'By[CONTACT_7943] 
2005). In addition, budesonide /formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy or ‘SMART’ 
(available commercially as the Symbicort Turbuhaler [Symbicort] in the European Union and other markets)  significantly reduced severe exacerbation risk in pediatric patients ( O'By[CONTACT_7943] 
2007).

Budesonide/ Albuterol (BDA) – AV004  [ADDRESS_342469] on improvement of lung 
function and achieving asthma improvement beyond what is seen with albuterol and budesonide 
alone. Current treatment guidelines ( GINA 2018 ) recommend considering addition of low -dose 
ICS to SABA used as reliever medication as early as in GINA step 1 asthma (previously treated with SABA prn alone), broadening the range of asthma severity grades that would be treated by [CONTACT_280851] β2- adrenoreceptor agonist. Anti-inflammatory  and bronchodilation component in 
combination is expected to result with superior control and decreased risk of experiencing 
asthma symptoms.  
1.[ADDRESS_342470]. This study is designed to investigate the benefit of 2 dose level s 
of BDA MDI compared to its constituent components budesonide metered -dose inhaler (BD 
MDI [PT008]) and albuterol sulfate metered -dose inhaler (AS MDI [PT007]) based on 
improvement in lung function and asthma symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment. This study w ill 
demonstrate the combination rule required by [CONTACT_280852] 21 Code of Federal Regulations 300.50. Two dosage levels , of BDA MDI  administered 4 times daily (QID) , 80/180 μg ( given as 
2 actuations of BDA MDI 40/90 μg per puff) and 160/180 μg (given as 2 actuations of BDA 
MDI 80/90 μg per puff) , are included in this study to support final dose selection for approval. 
Children aged 4 to 11 years will only be randomized to the lower dosage level of BDA MDI 
(80/180 μg QID , or AS MDI [180 μg QID ], or placebo  MDI ).

of each component of the combination to the overall bronchodilator efficacy: 
• Change from baseline in forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second (FEV 1) area under the curve 
from 0 to 6 hours (AUC 0-6 hours) over 12 weeks  
• Change from baseline in trough FEV 1 at Week 12  
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment  
This s tudy consists of [ADDRESS_342473] of BDA MDI on  the occurrence of severe asthma  exacerbations and is part 
of the regulatory requirements for US registration of BDA MDI for an  asthma indication. This 
study has 2 active control groups ( BD MDI and AS MDI ), and a placebo  MDI control group, 
designed. SABA ( Ventolin®) will also be provided to each subject prn in response to asthma 
symptoms. 
It should be noted that as part of this study design, some of the subjects who have not received 
ICS before may be assigned to treatment with BD MDI  or BDA MDI . In addition, some sub jects 
who have been receiving low-dose ICS may be randomized to either placebo MDI or AS MDI ( ie, 
they will no longer be receiving ICS treatment).  
To mitigate potential risks, all subjects will be closely monitored to ensure subject  safety 
throughout the study through a range of mechanisms including: 
• Frequently evaluated by [CONTACT_280853] W eeks 1, 4, 8, and 12.  
• Subjects will provide information to the electronic diary ( eDiary ) including; asthma 
symptoms score, use of Ventolin prn in response to asthma symptoms, dosing of Sponsor-
provided investigational product (IP, captured in eDiary in evenings only) , and peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229]  (PEF) twice daily. In the situation where the subject’s  symptoms and/or 
Ventolin prn use has increased and/or PEF decreased over [ADDRESS_342474], the investigator site, and the Sponsor’s medical monitoring team. This alert should initiate contact [CONTACT_280854] -being of the subject. 
• The eDiary  will be programmed to alert both the subject and study center to assess the well -
being of the subject and any possible asthma exacerbation.  
• An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established  to assess the 
ongoing safety of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  21 of 142 • The Sponsor’s medical team will have medical oversight of blinded data for continuous 
subject safety  evaluations.  
 
The Sponsor considers the risk and benefit profile of Study AV004 -DENALI to be acceptable 
when considering and assessing all non- clinical and clinical data available for study treatments.  
COVID-19  
Recent information from the American Academy of Allery Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) 
published on their website ( https://www.aaa ai.org/ ) on June 4, [ADDRESS_342475] to “get and 
keep their asthma under control.” In the DENALI study, subjects  are provided Ventolin for as 
needed use and have their asthma symptoms closely monitored through daily eDiary symptom alerts provided to the investigator and medical monitors. The Sponsor believes that the benefit-
risk assessment for trial participants to enroll and continue in the study remains  positive.  
 
 
1.4 Study design  
This is a 12- week, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, parallel  group, 
Phase III study. The purpose of this study is to com pare 2 dose level s of BDA MDI compared to 
its constitute components BD MDI  and AS MDI  on improvement in lung function and asthma 
symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment ( Section  5.1.1) in adults , adolescents,  and child subjects , 
aged  4 years and older, with symptomatic asthma currently being treated with SABA prn  alone 
or with low -dose ICS  maintenance therapy plus SABA prn .  
Subjects meeting all entry criteria at the screening visit (Visit 1) will enter a 14 to 28 -day 
screening ( run-in) period.  
Only Sponsor-provided IP administered 4 times per day (QID) and Sponsor- provided Ventolin to 
be used in response to asthma symptoms are allowed during the study. No other asthma medications are allowed during the study. 
During the screening (run -in) period, subjects will self -administer single -blind placebo MDI QID 
and Ventolin  prn to be used in response to asthma symptoms only. Subjects  will be trained  and 
instructed in the use of an eDiary and peak flow meter at Visit [ADDRESS_342476] protocol required data 
into the eDiary twice daily  (Section 5.1.6).    
Eligible subjects will be randomiz ed at Visit 2.   
At randomization (Visit 2), adult and adolescent subjects (age ≥12 years) who meet the 
eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to  1 of the following 5 treatment groups in a 
1:1:1:1:1 ratio :

Approximately 1000 adults and adolescent subjects (≥12 years of age) with asthma will be 
randomized  1:1:1:1:1 to 1 of 5 treatment groups (approximately 200 subjects per group: BDA 
MDI 80/180 μg  QID , BDA MDI 160/180 μg QID , BD MDI 160 μg QID, or AS MDI 180 μg 
QID or placebo MDI ). In addition, up to 30 child subjects (4 to 11 years of age) with asthma 
will be enrolled but will not receive high dose ICS and will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive low-dose BDA MDI 80/180 μg QID, AS MDI 180 μg QID, or placebo MDI . Approximately 
2000 subjects will need to be screened, assuming an estimated screen fail ure rate of 50% prior 
to randomization. This Phase III study is planned to be conducted globally.   
The investigator (s) and/or study personnel will: 
1 Obtain signed informed consent /assent (as applicable)  from the potential subject  and/or 
their guardian/legal representative  before any study specific procedures are performed

requires knowledge of the treatment allocation. Individual treatment details, for each subject, 
will be available to the investigator(s) or pharmacists from the IWRS , if needed. If unblinding 
occurs , the investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible, but without revealing the 
treatment assignment of the unblinded subject. Routines for this will be described in the IWRS user manual that will be provided to each center. The IWRS provides unblinding procedures, if needed.

Subjects may be withdrawn from the study at any time at their own request, upon request of 
the investigator, or by [CONTACT_280859].  The subject or his/her 
parent/legal representative is free to discontinue treatment at any time, without prejudice to further treatment. Other reasons for IP discontinuation may include:  
• An AE considered to jeopardiz e the safety of a subject participating in the study  
• Subjects who suffer [ADDRESS_342506] to discontinue randomized treatment and withdraw from the study  
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the subject is non-compliant with the Clinical Study Protocol ( eg, post- enrollment eligibility violation , failure to adhere to dosing compliance) 
or is lost to follow -up and no alternative contact [CONTACT_42035] (this implies that 
at least [ADDRESS_342507])  
• If female subject becomes pregnant, the subject will automatically be discontinued from IP 
• In subjects who have elevated liver enzymes AST and/or ALT ≥3 times the upper limit of normal ( ×ULN) and total bilirubin ≥2× ULN (ie, meeting the criteria of at least potential 
Hy’s Law), IP will be suspended until the liver test values return to the normal range. If the AST, A LT, or total bilirubin reach these elevated levels again, after recommencement 
of IP, the subject will be discontinued from IP and withdrawn from the study. 
Subjects who discontinue IP prior to the end of the 12- week treatment period will be 
withdrawn from the study and will be asked to complete a PDV, and AEs/SAEs will be followed up if medically indicated . 
A subject that decides to discontinue IP  will always be asked about the reason(s) and the 
presence of any AEs. If possible, they will be seen and asses sed by [CONTACT_2413] (s). AEs  and 
SAEs will be followed up ( Section 6); eDiary and all IP s should be returned by [CONTACT_423].

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  34 of 142 • The study may be stopped if, in the judgement of the Sponsor, study subjects are placed at 
undue risk because of findings that: 
- are considered significant  
- are assessed as causally related to IP  
- are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in 
the study 
• A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or 
development of the IP for any reason  
Conditions that may warrant termination of a study center’s participation  include, but are not

4 STUDY PLAN AND TIMING OF PROCEDURES  
Table 1 presents study assessments and procedures and Table 2 presents timed assessments at 
Visit 2 through Visit 6 . Repeat assessments, if needed, will be captured in unscheduled visits. 
General Considerations  
• For s ubjects who inadvertently took IP, SABA, or any bronchodilator in the morning of 
any study visit, either the entire visit must be rescheduled or just PFT ass essment 
rescheduled . 
• Subjects must not ingest xanthine and/or xanthine analogue (caffeine)-containing foods 
and beverages for at least 6 hours prior to each study visit and for the duration of each 
study visit. Examples of such products include coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola. Decaffeinated beverages are acceptable.  
• Subjects should avoid having a large meal at least 2 hours prior to a study visit. 
• Subjects w ill be required to return to the clinic at approximately the same time at Visit 2 
for all treatment visits (±2 hours) and dosing time should not exceed 10:00 AM and 
pulmonary function tests ( PFTs ) should be completed within ±1 hour of Visit 2. Subjects 
will be required to remain at  clinic until completion of all protocol- defined assessments.  
In order to minimize diurnal variance, sites should make every effort to assess subjects at the same time throughout the study. 
 
• IP should be taken in the morning upon waking, and then distributed equally throughout the day with the final dose taken before going to sleep. The evening before clinic visits, subjects should be advised to take the last dose at 22:00 ±2  hours.
 
• To ensure dosing time standardization, it is recommended that sites encourage subjects to maintain a dosing schedule consistent with their in -clinic dosing time and that sites call 
the subject s on the day before a scheduled visit to remind the subject of the following: 
− To take their last dose the even ing before the scheduled visit 
− To withhold all inhaled medications ( oral and intranasal ) for at least 6 hours prior to 
PFTs   
− To bring their study medications and eDiary with them to the clinic  
Site personnel will instruct subjects not to take any inhaled  medications, without site 
personnel permission, during a visit until all study procedures have been completed, and the 
subject is discharged. Site personnel should take every precaution to prevent subject use of 
asthma  medications during the test day. Site personnel may reque st the sub ject to surrender all 
IP and Ventolin prior to the visit start before performing any study procedures and return the 
IP and Ventolin to the subject at the end of the visit when all study procedures are completed. 
Subjects will be asked to abstain wherever possible from using Ventolin during study visits. If a subject is experiencing severe symptoms and requires Ventolin in response to a sthma 
symptoms at any time during a test day, site personnel must note the time and justification of

of asthma management is to optimize asthma control (minimization of symptoms, activity limitation, bronchoconstriction, and rescue β2 -agonist use) and thus reduce the risk of life-threatening exacerbations and long-term morbidity. The ACQ-5 ( Appendix H, Asthma 
Control Questionnaire ) was developed to meet these criteria. It measures both the adequacy of 
asthma control and change in asthma control, which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of treatment.  
The ACQ -5 will be administered using the eDiary  during site visits as indicated in  Table 1 
(Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and PDV) and Table 2 for timed assessments at Visits 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, and

All protocol- defined severe asthma exacerbations need to fulfill the symptom criteria as defined 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and be supported by [CONTACT_280866]. 
An asthma exacerbation will be considered severe if it results in at least 1 of the following: 
• A temporary bolus/burst of SCS  for at least 3 consecutive days to treat symptoms of asthma 
worsening; a single depo-injectable dose of corticosteroids will be considered equivalent to 
a 3-day bolus/burst of SCS   
• An emergency room or urgent care visit (defined as evaluation and treatment for <24 hours 
in an emergency department or urgent care center) due to asthma that required SCS  (as per

Any clinically significant changes in vital signs should be recorded as an AE if applicable.  
5.2.4 Adverse event  assessments 
AEs will be collected from time of signature [CONTACT_43998]/assent through to the follow-
up period as described in Section 6. 
5.3 Other assessments  
5.3.1 Physical examination 
A complete physical examination will be performed at screening ( Visit 1 ), Visit 6 , and PDV (if 
applicable) as detailed in Table 1. This will include an assessment of the following items: height 
in centimeters and BMI  (both at Visit 1 only), weight, general appearance, respi[INVESTIGATOR_36517] , 
cardiovascular  system , abdomen, skin, head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose, and throat), 
lymph nodes, thyroid, musculoskeletal system (including spi[INVESTIGATOR_98243]), and neurological system.  
5.3.2 Concomitant medications 
The collection  and recording of all concomitant medications , including all pre -enrollment 
asthma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , will be performed at the visits detailed in Table 1. Permitted and restricted 
concomitant medications are descri bed in Section 7.8. 
All prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, and over-the-counter medications 
taken within 3 months before  screening  (Visit 1) will be  recorded as pr evious medications . All 
medications taken after screening  and through the safety follow-up visit will be  recorded as 
concomitant therapy.   
Subjects will be maintained , after Visit 1, on IP and Ventolin to be used in response to asthma 
symptoms throughout the treatment period.  For restrictions relating to concomitant medications see Sections 3.[ADDRESS_342571] not be used to support any marketing authorization application or any variation or extension of such application

relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom ( eg, nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence . An AE may occur at any time, including the 
screening  period, even if no IP  has been administered.  
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event  
An SAE  is an AE occurring during any study phase ( ie, after  the signing of the informed 
consent/assent  through to the safety follow-up visit ), that fulfill s 1 or more of the following 
criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_280816] 3.0, Amendment 2  Bond Avillion 2 Development LP  
Budesonide/ Albuterol (BDA) – AV004  06 July 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  57 of 142 • Results in persistent or significant disability or in capacity  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above 
 
For further guidance on the definition of an SAE, see Appendix D, Additional safety information  to the Clinical Study Protocol. 
6.3 Recording of adverse events  
6.3.1 Period for collection of adverse events 
Adverse events and SAEs will be collected from time of signature [CONTACT_43998]/assent, through the safety follow-up period. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_342573]’s last assessment  visit in the study are followed up 
by [CONTACT_24549], but without further recording in the eCRF . The Sponsor or a  Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department 
representative retains the right to request additio nal information for any subject with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study (after the subject’s final study visit) and capture that information in the eCRF, if judged necessary  
6.3.3 Variables  
The following variables will be collected  for each AE : 
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date when the AE started and stopped 
• Maximum severity  
• Seriousness 
• Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no) 
• Action taken with regard to IP  
• Outcome 
 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: 
• Date AE met criteria for SAE 
• Date investigator became aware of S AE 
• Reason why the AE is considered serious 
• Treatment given for the SAE  
• Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_280817] 3.0, Amendment 2  Bond Avillion 2 Development LP  
Budesonide/ Albuterol (BDA) – AV004  06 July 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  58 of 142 • Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Whether autopsy is performed 
• Causality as sessment in relation to study procedure(s) 
• Causality assessment to other medication  
• Description of AE 
 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_280868] 6.2. An AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious . For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On 
the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a 
mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2. 
The severity of th e event should be assessed as mild, moderate,  or severe.  
6.3.4 Causality collection 
The investigator and the Sponsor will assess causal relationship between IP and each AE , and 
answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that 
the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33249]?’ 
For SAEs , causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures. 
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’.  
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix D, Additional safety 
information  of this Clinical Study Protocol.

the e CRF . When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnosis is preferred (when possible) over 
recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 
Asthma symptoms or signs, such as wheeze, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea , breathlessness, 
and phlegm, will be recorded as AEs only when:

• The subject  discontinues IP due to the sign or symptom 
• The sign or symptom is new to the subject or not consistent with the subject’s pre-existing 
asthma history (defined as within 1 year of Visit 1) as judged by [CONTACT_093]  
 
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests 
The results from the Clinical Stu dy Protocol mandated laboratory tests , ECGs,  vital signs, and 
other safety assessments will be summarized in the Clinical Study Report. Deterioration from 
baseline in these parameters  should therefore only be reported as an AE if it fulfil ls any of the 
AE criteria or is the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IP or is considered 
'clinically significant'.  
The criteria for determining whether the mandated laboratory tests, ECGs, vital signs, and other safety assessments are clinically significant and should be reported as AEs are generally:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms or signs, and/ or  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or  
• Test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_76617]. 
 
If deterioration in a laboratory value, ECG, vital sign , or other safety assessment  is associated 
with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the 
associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information. Wherever 
possible, the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term ( eg, anemia 
versus low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non- mandated  parameters should be reported as AE(s).  
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with findings at the baseline assessment will  be reported as an AE . 
6.3.7 Hy’s Law 
Cases where a subject shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and 
occurrences of AST and/ or ALT ≥3 ×ULN combined  with  TBL ≥2 ×ULN may require IP 
suspension/discontinuation and study withdrawal, and may  need to be reported as SAE s. Please 
refer to  Section 3.9 and  Appendix E, Hy’s Law  for further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s L aw.

6.7 Medication error  
For the purposes of this clinical study, a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatmen t process for the Sponsor’s IP that either causes harm to the subject or has the 
potential to cause harm to the subject.  
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or subject. 
Medication error includes situations where an error :  
 
• Occurred  
• Was identified and intercepted before the subject received the drug 
• Did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error 
 
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors: 
 
• Drug name [CONTACT_2976] 
• Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to 
the subject  
• Drug not administered as indicated, eg , wrong route or wrong site of administration 
• Drug not taken as indicated  
• Drug not stored as instructed: eg , kept in the re frigerator  when it should be at room 
temperature  
• Wrong subject received the medication (excluding IWRS errors)  
• Wron g drug administered to subject (excluding IWRS errors) 
 
Examples of events that do not  require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies: 
 
• Errors related to or resulting from IWRS-including those which lead to [ADDRESS_342582] not be used to support any marketing authorization application or any variation or extension of such application

• Subject failed to return unused medication or empty packaging 
• Errors related to background medication, or standard of care medication in open- label 
studies, even if it is a  Sponsor’s product 
 
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medication error.   
All medication errors must be recorded in the Overdose/Medication Error eCRF. Any associated AEs should also be recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE/SAE modules in the eCRF. 
If a medication error occurs during the course of the study which has an associated SAE, then 
the investigator or other site personnel will inform the  Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance Department immediately, or no later than [ADDRESS_342583] –related toxicities

treatment and will use the full analysis set , in accordance with the primary estimand ( Section 
8.1.1).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dual -primary efficacy endpoints  
The primary efficacy  analysis comprises of 2 dual-primary endpoints of change from baseline in 
FEV 1 AUC 0-6 hours  over 12 weeks and change from baseline in trough FEV 1 at Week 12 . 
Baseline FEV 1 will be taken as the average of the 60- and 30- minute  pre-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_280826] (Visit 2).

The minimal important difference (MID)  in ACQ -7 score is estimated to be 0.5 ( Juniper 2005). 
On the basis of the MID, responders at Week [ADDRESS_342606] 0.5:  
• Responder: (Week 12 – baseline) ≤ -0.5 
• Non-responder: (Week 12  – baseline) > -0.[ADDRESS_342607] dose of

Additionally, an exploratory endpoint will be considered to assess the changes from baseline ACQ-7 overall score at Week 12 as the following 3- level factor:  
• Improvement: ( Week 12 – baseline) ≤  -0.5 
• No Change: - 0.5 < ( Week 12 – baseline) <  0.5 
• Worsening: ( Week 12 – baseline) ≥ 0.5  
Subjects who discontinue treatment for any reason before Week 12 will be classified as non-
responders. 
The interviewer -administered version will be implemented for children aged 4 to 10 years. As 
the AC Q-7 is not validated for children < 6 years old, data for subjects who are 4 or 5 years of 
age will be excluded from the analyses of ACQ -7 endpoints. 
8.5.3 Exploratory efficacy analyses  
The exploratory analyses will include all data obtained before subjects discontinue randomized 
treatment and will use the full analysis set , in accordance with the primary estimand 
(Section  8.1.1).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Derivation of severe exacerbation endpoints  
For the production of summary statistics, the raw annualized severe asthma exacerbation rate will be calculated according to the following formula: 
Annualized severe exacerbation rate=∑ number of severe exacerbations*365.25/∑ follow -up, 
where the summations are over all subjects within a treatment group.

Further guidance on the d efinition of a serious adverse event  
 
Life-threatening  
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
subject’s death . ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that an AE occurred in a more se vere form , 
it might have caused death ( eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_280843] a n SAE, although the reasons for it 
may be (eg , bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l admissions and/or surgical operations 
planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. 
 
Important medical event or medical intervention  
Medical and scientific judgement  should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability , or incapacity , but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_342658] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical

- Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous hydrocortisone treatment. 
- Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N -acetylcysteine. 
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at -home for allergic bronchospasm. 
- Blood dyscrasias ( eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
- Development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  102 of 142 A guide to i nterpreting the causality q uestio n 
When making an assessment of causality , consider the following factors when deciding if 
there is a ‘ reasonable possibility’ that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641]: 
• Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the subject actually received  the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of 
the suspect drug? 
• Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties? 
• De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_72918]? 
• No alternative cause. The AE cannot be r easonably explained by [CONTACT_280883], other drugs, and other host or environmental factors. 
• Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? The Sponsor would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge.  
• Laboratory tests . A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship . 
 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: 
• Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug? 
• Is there a known mechanism? 
 
Causality of ‘related’ is made if after  a review of the relevant data there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
The causality assessment is performed on the basis of the available data, including enough 
information to make an informed judgement . With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.  
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated because of  lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  103 of 142 APPENDIX E , HY’S LAW  
Introduction 
This Appendix describes the process to be followed to  identify and appropriately report cases 
of Hy’s L aw. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated 
liver biochemistries.   
During the course of the study, the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemi stry. In subjects who have elevated liver enzymes AST and/or ALT ≥ 3×ULN and 
total bilirubin ≥ 2×ULN, IP will be suspended until the liver test values return to the normal range. If the AST, ALT, or total bilirubin reach these elevated levels again, after 
recommencement of IP, the subject will be discontinued from IP and withdrawn from the study. The investigator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets potential Hy’s 
Law criteria at any point during the study. 
The investigator participates, w ith the Sponsor’s clinical project representatives, in review and 
assessment of cases meeting potential Hy’s Law (PHL)  criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law 
(HL) criteria are met . Hy’s L aw criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the 
elevations in liver biochemistry other than drug induced l iver injury caused by [CONTACT_33249] .  
The investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to potential HL /HL cases and for 
reportin g AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with 
standard safety reporting processes. 
Definitions  
Potential Hy’s L aw  
Aspartate aminotransferase and/ or alanine transaminase ≥3 × ULN combined with  TBL 
≥2×ULN at any point during the study after  the start of  IP irrespective of an increase in 
alkaline phosphatase.  
Hy’s Law 
AST and/ or ALT ≥3 ×ULN combined  with  TBL ≥2 ×ULN, where no other reason, other than 
the IP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg , elevated alkaline phosphatase 
indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, or another drug.   
For potential HL and HL, the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with 
(ie, on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which 
the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur. 
Identification of potential Hy’s L aw c ases

Budesonide/ Albuterol (BDA) – AV004   [ADDRESS_342659] who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in 
combination:  
• ALT ≥3 ×ULN  
• AST ≥3 ×ULN  
• TBL ≥2 ×ULN  
When a subject meets  any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the 
central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the investigator and the medical monitor assigned to the project.  
The investigator will also remain vigilant for any local labora tory reports where the 
identification criteria are met; where this is the case, the investigator will: 
- Notify the medical monitor assigned to the project. 
- Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by [CONTACT_2237]. 
- Contact [CONTACT_280884]. Where an AE is entered due to elevations of local 
laboratory value s, the AE will be queried in the eCRF and elevated local lab oratory 
values, units and ranges will be entered to the query response. 
- When the identification criteria are met from central or local laboratory results , the 
investigator will without delay: 
- Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria by [CONTACT_48886] (including both central and local laboratory 
results) . 
- The investigator will, without delay, review each new laboratory report and if the 
identification criteria are met, will:  
- Notify the medical monitor assigned to the project. 
- Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria by [CONTACT_280885]. 
- Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory e CRF. 
Follow- up 
Potential Hy’s L aw c riteria not met  
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the investigator will:  
Inform the medical monitor assigned to the project that the subject has not met PHL criteria.  

Clinical Study Protocol Version 3.0, Amendment 2  Bond Avillion 2 Development LP  
Budesonide/ Albuterol (BDA) – AV004   06 July 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  105 of 142 Perform follow -up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance provided in the 
Clinical Study Protocol. 
Potential Hy’s L aw c riteria met  
If the subject does meet PHL criteria, the investigator  will: 
Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any study visit before  starting IP  (Actions 
required when potential Hy’s Law criteria are met before and after starting  IP) 
Notify the medical monitor assigned to the project who will then inform the central study t eam  
The medical monitor assigned to the project will discuss the issue with the investigator to 
provide guidance and agree an approach for the study subjects’ follow-up and the continuous review of data. Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_280886]:  
Monitor the subject until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical symptoms and 
signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated  
Inves tigate the cause of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed with the 
medical monitor assigned to the project. For studies using a central laboratory add: This 
includes deciding which the tests available in the HL laboratory  kit should be used .  
Complete the 3 Liver e CRF modules as information becomes available  
If at any time (in consultation with the medical monitor assigned to the project ) the PHL case 
meets serious criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures. 
Review and assessment of potential Hy’s L aw c ases 
No later than [ADDRESS_342660] and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently 
whether the AE meets the criteria for an SAE : 
If the alternative explanation is not  an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate e CRF  
If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE/SAE in the eCRF accordingly and follow the Sponsor’s standard processes 

Clinical Study Protocol Version 3.0, Amendment 2  Bond Avillion 2 Development LP  
Budesonide/ Albuterol (BDA) – AV004   [ADDRESS_342661] and TBL 
elevations other than the IP: 
Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to the Sponsor’s standard processes.  
− The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious criteria 
apply. 
− As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned. 
 
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then i t is assumed that there is no 
alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:  
Report an SAE (report term ‘potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and causality 
assessment as per above  
Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary supplementary 
information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria 
are met . Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the review amending the reported 
term if an alternative explanation for the liver biochemistry elevations is determined. 
Actions r equired w hen potential Hy’s L aw c riteria are m et before and after s tarting IP   
This section is applicable to subjects who meet PHL criteria on study treatment having 
previously met PHL criteria at a study visit before  starting IP . 
At the first on study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria being met the investigator will: 
Determine if there has been a significant change in the subjects’ condition compared with the 
last visit where PHL criteria were met  
− If there is no significant change no action is required. 
− If there is a significant change, notify the Sponsor representative, who will inform the 
central study team, then follow the subsequent process described in Potential Hy’s Law criteria met  of this Appendix. 
 
A ‘significant’ change in the subject’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of 
the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST,  or TBL) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The d etermination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator; this 
may be in consultation with the medical monitor assigned to the project if there is any 
uncertainty.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  107 of 142 Actions r equired for repeat epi[INVESTIGATOR_280844]’s Law  
This section is applicable when a subject meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has 
already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.  
The requirement to conduct follow-up, review,  and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.   
The investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met and answer the following question: 
Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met found to be 
the disease under study or did the subject meet PHL criteria before  starting study treatment 
and at their first on study treatment visit as describe d in Actions required when potential Hy’s 
Law criteria are met before and after starting IP . 
If No: follow the process described in Potential Hy’s Law criteria  met of this Appendix. 
If Yes:  
Determine if there has been a significant change in the subject’s condition compared with when PHL criteria wer e previously met 
If there is no significant change, no action is required 
If there is a significant change: A ‘significant’ change in the subject’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of 
the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST,  or TBL) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The d etermination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator ; this 
may be in consultation with the medical monitor assigned to the project if there is any uncertainty.

return of government or local restrictions on movement of people and goods. 
Any procedure performed outside the protocol specified requirements will be documented as a 
protocol deviation. 
Visit Management:  
Delayed Visits  
 • Out of window visits should be considered if it is necessary to 
safeguard the health of the subject  and site staff or enables an 
on-site subject  visit.  
• If a return to lockdown is announced or the sit e is on lockdown 
and cannot process a visit, if possible, visits should be 
rescheduled  to earlier/later as required to safeguard subjects  
and site staff .   
• Randomization:  If a subject is in screening and cannot 
complete the randomisation visit within 28 days due to local 
COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, the screening period may be 
extended to a maximum of 9 weeks. In the event of an extension to the screening period >28 days due to COVID, the following safety measurements should be repeated in advance 
of randomisation: safety laboratory assessments, ECG, vital 
signs, concomitant medications, and medical/surgical history.   
• Visit 6 /Week 24 :  All efforts should be made to complete the 
associated assessments in the clinic, even if this is  visit is  
delayed. If necessary, whil e waiting for the time to complete 
this visit, an unscheduled call and drug dispensing should be done to ensure the subject has sufficient IP during this time.

Budesonide/ Albuterol (BDA) – AV004   06 July 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  141 of 142 Remote Visits  • Where subject s have COVID -[ADDRESS_342673] happened on- site.  
• Before performance of a remote visit, verbal consent must b e 
obtained and documented in the subject’s medical notes to ensure that the subject understands the implications of continuing in the study when face to face visits are temporarily 
not possible due to COVID [ADDRESS_342674] will be required.   
• If a remote  visit is completed and it is considered appropriate 
and safe to continue study drug, this could be dispatched direct 
to the subject  by [CONTACT_30367].   
• Randomization visits cannot be conducted remotely and 
therefore subjects in screening who do not wish to attend an 
on-site visit should be screen-failed as 'withdrawal of consent'. 
Subject 
Discontinuation • Where repeated visits are likely to be missed, the site should 
discuss with the subject and consider ongoing treatment options. Where a subject does not wish to attend further clinic 
visits, a PDV visit should be scheduled. 
Shipment  of Drug 
from Site to Subject s 
 • Subject s should provide verbal consent via a telephone call to 
use their personal details to complete the site to subject  
shipment request. Consent must be documented in the subject  
medical records and preferably confirmed i n writing via an 
email or other written means (eg , via post) via a phone call 
initially and followed up by [CONTACT_280887].  
Safety Labs  • Where central analysis is not possible, local testing is 
permitted. Lab normal ranges would need to be made available.  

Clinical Study Protocol Version 3.0, Amendment 2  Bond Avillion 2 Development LP  
Budesonide/ Albuterol (BDA) – AV004   06 July 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  142 of 142 • In the event that routine safety lab tests are missed due to 
temporary inability of subject to get to site due to COVID -19, 
an unscheduled lab should be done at their next clinic visit if 
possible.  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  • The i nvestigator should request confirmation from the subjects 
to confirm that they are not aware of having been exposed to 
COVID-[ADDRESS_342675] to 
this information  prior to conducting spi[INVESTIGATOR_31757].  
Sites should continue to follow hygiene and cleaning guidance 
within the manuals to minimize possible cross-contamination.   
Subjects  with 
Confirmed COVID -
19 Infection  • If a subject  has confirmed COVID -19 this is to be reported as 
an AE/SAE, but is not per se a reason to withdraw the subject . 
• The investigator should determine whether the subject’s  IP 
should continue, be interrupted, or stopped in accordance with the Clinical Study Pr otocol. 
• The investigator should continue to reassess the benefit- risk of 
continued study involvement for a study subject  infected with 
COVID-19. In -clinic visits for this subject should only re-
commence once the infection has resolved and the subject is no longer considered to be infectious. 
• For new subjects previously identified as COVID -[ADDRESS_342676] be performed after resolution of symptoms (if 
present). The subject  can only be considered for enroll ment 4 
weeks after having a negative result.
